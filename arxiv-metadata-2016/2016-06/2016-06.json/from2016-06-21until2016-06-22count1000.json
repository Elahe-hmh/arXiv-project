"abstract": ["  The Galactic center (GC) is a dense and chaotic region filled with unusual\nsources, such as intense star forming regions, dense star clusters, nonthermal\nradio filaments, and a massive black hole. The proximity of the GC region makes\nit an ideal place to study the unusual processes that tend to manifest\nthemselves in Galactic nuclei. This thesis uses single-dish and interferometric\nradio continuum, radio recombination line, polarized radio continuum, and\nmid-IR observations to study the wide variety of physical processes seen in the\nGC region on physical scales from 0.1 to 100 parsecs. These observations\nprovide one of the most sensitive studies of the radio continuum emission in\nthe central 500 parsecs. I also study the properties of nonthermal radio\nfilaments, which can constrain their origin and the structure of the magnetic\nfield in the GC region.\n  The presence of massive star clusters and a massive black hole suggest that\nstarburst and AGN phenomena can manifest themselves in our Galaxy. This thesis\nexplores this possibility by studying a 150-pc-tall, shell-like structure\ncalled the Galactic center lobe (GCL). Our observations examine the spectral\nindex, dust emission, polarized continuum emission, and ionized gas throughout\nthe GCL. I find strong evidence supporting the idea that the GCL is a true\nthree-dimensional shell located in the GC region with nested layers of ionized,\nmagnetized, and mid-IR--emitting components. I compare the physical conditions\nof the GCL to proposed models for its origin and find best agreement with\nstarburst outflows seen in other galaxies, yet consistent with the currently\nobserved pressure and star formation rate in the central tens of parsecs of our\nGalaxy. (abridged)\n", "  Equations arising in General Relativity are usually too complicated to be\nsolved analytically and one has to rely on numerical methods to solve sets of\ncoupled partial differential equations. Among the possible choices, this paper\nfocuses on a class called spectral methods where, typically, the various\nfunctions are expanded onto sets of orthogonal polynomials or functions. A\ntheoretical introduction on spectral expansion is first given and a particular\nemphasis is put on the fast convergence of the spectral approximation. We\npresent then different approaches to solve partial differential equations,\nfirst limiting ourselves to the one-dimensional case, with one or several\ndomains. Generalization to more dimensions is then discussed. In particular,\nthe case of time evolutions is carefully studied and the stability of such\nevolutions investigated. One then turns to results obtained by various groups\nin the field of General Relativity by means of spectral methods. First, works\nwhich do not involve explicit time-evolutions are discussed, going from rapidly\nrotating strange stars to the computation of binary black holes initial data.\nFinally, the evolutions of various systems of astrophysical interest are\npresented, from supernovae core collapse to binary black hole mergers.\n", "  The dust component of the interstellar medium (ISM) has been extensively\nstudied in the past decades. Late-type stars have been assumed as the main\nsource of dust to the ISM, but recent observations show that supernova remnants\nmay play a role on the ISM dust feedback. In this work, I study the importance\nof low and high mass stars, as well as their evolutionary phase, on the ISM\ndust feedback process. I also determine the changes on the obtained results\nconsidering different mass distribution functions and star formation history.\nWe describe a semi-empirical calculation of the relative importance of each\nstar at each evolutionary phase in the dust ejection to the ISM. I compare the\nobtained results for two stellar mass distribution functions, the classic\nSalpeter initial mass function and the present day mass function. I used the\nevolutionary track models for each stellar mass, and the empirical mass-loss\nrates and dust-to-gas ratio. The relative contribution of each stellar mass\ndepends on the used distribution. Ejecta from massive stars represent the most\nimportant objects for the ISM dust replenishment using the Salpeter IMF. On the\nother hand, for the present day mass function low and intermediate mass stars\nare dominant. Late-type giant and supergiant stars dominate the ISM dust\nfeedback in our actual Galaxy, but this may not the case of galaxies\nexperiencing high star formation rates, or at high redshifts. In those cases,\nSNe are dominant in the dust feedback process.\n", "  Context. We analyse the line and continuum spectra of the symbiotic system CH\nCygni. Aims. To show that the colliding-wind model is valid to explain this\nsymbiotic star at different phases. Methods. Peculiar observed features such as\nflickering, radio variation, X-ray emission, as well as the distribution of the\nnebulae and shells throughout the system are investigated by modelling the\nspectra at different epochs. The models account consistently for shock and\nphotoionization and are constrained by absolute fluxes. Results. We find that\nthe reverse shock between the stars leads to the broad lines observed during\nthe active phases, as well as to radio and hard X-ray emission, while the\nexpanding shock is invoked to explain the data during the transition phases.\n", "  The possibility of observationally discriminating between various types of\nneutron stars, described by different equations of state of the nuclear matter,\nas well as differentiating neutron stars from other types of exotic objects,\nlike, for example, quark stars, is one of the fundamental problems in\ncontemporary astrophysics. We consider and investigate carefully the\npossibility that different types of rapidly rotating neutron stars, as well as\nother type of compact general relativistic objects, can be differentiated from\nthe study of the emission properties of the accretion disks around them. We\nobtain the energy flux, the temperature distribution and the emission spectrum\nfrom the accretion disks around several classes of rapidly rotating neutron\nstars, described by different equations of state of the neutron matter, and for\nquark stars, described by the MIT bag model equation of state and in the CFL\n(Color-Flavor-Locked) phase, respectively. Particular signatures appear in the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the possibility of directly testing\nthe equation of state of the dense matter by using astrophysical observations\nof the emission spectra from accretion disks.\n", "  T lymphocytes (T cells) orchestrate adaptive immune responses upon\nactivation. T cell activation requires sufficiently strong binding of T cell\nreceptors (TCRs) on their surface to short peptides (p) derived from foreign\nproteins, which are bound to major histocompatibility (MHC) gene products\n(displayed on antigen presenting cells). A diverse and self-tolerant T cell\nrepertoire is selected in the thymus. We map thymic selection processes to an\nextreme value problem and provide an analytic expression for the amino acid\ncompositions of selected TCRs (which enable its recognition functions).\n", "  We discuss a question whether the observed Weinberg angle and Higgs mass are\ncalculable in the formalism based on a construction in which the electroweak\ngauge group $SU(2)\\times U(1)_{Y}$ is embedded in the graded Lie group\n$SU(2/1)$. Here we follow original works of Ne'eman and Fairlie believing that\nbosonic fields take their values in the Lie superalgebra and fermionic fields\ntake their values in its representation space. At the same time, our approach\ndiffers significantly. The main one is that while for them the gauge symmetry\ngroup is $SU(2/1)$, here we consider only symmetries generated by its even\nsubgroup, i.e., symmetries of the standard electroweak model. The reason is\nthat such formalism fixes the quartic Higgs coupling and at the same time\nremoves the sign and statistics problems. The main result is that the presented\nmodel predicts values of the Weinberg angle and the Higgs mass correctly up to\nthe two-loop level. Moreover, the model sets the unification scale coinciding\nwith the electroweak scale and automatically describes the fermions correctly\nwith the correct quark and lepton charges.\n", "  We present the Suzaku results of a supernova remnant (SNR), G359.1-0.5 in the\ndirection of the Galactic center region. From the SNR, we find prominent\nK-shell lines of highly ionized Si and S ions, together with unusual structures\nat 2.5-3.0 and 3.1-3.6 keV. No canonical SNR plasma model, in either ionization\nequilibrium or under-ionization, can explain the structures. The energies and\nshapes of the structures are similar to those of the radiative transitions of\nfree electrons to the K-shell of He-like Si and S ions (radiative recombination\ncontinuum: RRC). The presence of the strong RRC structures indicates that the\nplasma is in over-ionization. In fact, the observed spectrum is well fitted\nwith an over-ionized plasma model. The best-fit electron temperature of 0.29\nkeV is far smaller than the ionization temperature of 0.77 keV, which means\nthat G359.1-0.5 is in extreme condition of over-ionization. We report some\ncautions on the physical parameters, and comment possible origins for the\nover-ionized plasma.\n", "  An outline of a proof of the decomposition of linear metric perturbations\ninto gauge-invariant and gauge-variant parts on the an arbitrary background\nspacetime which admits ADM decomposition is discussed. We explicitly construct\nthe gauge-invariant and gauge-variant parts of the linear metric perturbations\nthrough the assumption of the existence of some Green functions. We also\nconfirm the result through another approach. This implies that we can develop\nthe higher-order gauge-invariant perturbation theory on an arbitrary background\nspacetime. Remaining issues to complete the general-framework of the\ngeneral-relativistic higher-order gauge-invariant perturbation theories are\nalso discussed.\n", "  T cells orchestrate adaptive immune responses upon activation. T cell\nactivation requires sufficiently strong binding of T cell receptors on their\nsurface to short peptides derived from foreign proteins bound to protein\nproducts of the major histocompatibility (MHC) gene products, which are\ndisplayed on the surface of antigen presenting cells. T cells can also interact\nwith peptide-MHC complexes, where the peptide is derived from host (self)\nproteins. A diverse repertoire of relatively self-tolerant T cell receptors is\nselected in the thymus. We study a model, computationally and analytically, to\ndescribe how thymic selection shapes the repertoire of T cell receptors, such\nthat T cell receptor recognition of pathogenic peptides is both specific and\ndegenerate. We also discuss the escape probability of autoimmune T cells from\nthe thymus.\n", "  We study the parameter dependence of the internal structure of resonance\nstates by formulating Complex two-dimensional (2D) Matrix Model, where the two\ndimensions represent two-levels of resonances. We calculate a critical value of\nthe parameter at which \"nature transition\" with character exchange occurs\nbetween two resonance states, from the viewpoint of geometry on\ncomplex-parameter space. Such critical value is useful to know the internal\nstructure of resonance states with variation of the parameter in the system. We\napply the model to analyze the internal structure of hadrons with variation of\nthe color number Nc from infinity to a realistic value 3. By regarding 1/Nc as\nthe variable parameter in our model, we calculate a critical color number of\nnature transition between hadronic states in terms of quark-antiquark pair and\nmesonic molecule as exotics from the geometry on complex-Nc plane. For the\nlarge-Nc effective theory, we employ the chiral Lagrangian induced by\nholographic QCD with D4/D8/D8-bar multi-D brane system in the type IIA\nsuperstring theory.\n", "  We study 6d N=(2,0) theory of type SU(N) compactified on Riemann surfaces\nwith finite area, including spheres with fewer than three punctures. The Higgs\nbranch, whose metric is inversely proportional to the total area of the Riemann\nsurface, is discussed in detail. We show that the zero-area limit, which gives\nus a genuine 4d theory, can involve a Wigner-Inonu contraction of global\nsymmetries of the six-dimensional theory. We show how this explains why\nsubgroups of SU(N) can appear as the gauge group in the 4d limit. As a\nby-product we suggest that half-BPS codimension-two defects in the\nsix-dimensional (2,0) theory have an operator product expansion whose operator\nproduct coefficients are four-dimensional field theories.\n", "  We propose a method to obtain adiabatic internuclear potentials via energy\nvariation with the intercluster-distance constraint. The adiabatic $^{16}$O +\n$^{16,18}$O potentials obtained by the proposed method are applied to\ninvestigate the effects of valence neutrons in $^{16}$O + $^{18}$O sub-barrier\nfusions. Sub-barrier fusion cross sections of $^{16}$O + $^{18}$O are enhanced\nmore compared to those of $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O because of distortion of valence\nneutrons in $^{18}$O.\n", "  The band structures of ordered and thermally disordered\nLi$_2$Mo$_{12}$O$_{34}$ are calculated by use of ab-initio DFT-LMTO method. The\nunusual, very 1-dimensional band dispersion obtained in previous band\ncalculations is confirmed for the ordered structure, and the overall band\nstructure agrees reasonably with existing photoemission data. Dispersion and\nbandstructure perpendicular to the main dispersive direction is obtained. A\ntemperature dependent band broadening is calculated from configurations with\nthermal disorder of the atomic positions within the unit cell. This leads a\nband broadening of the two bands at the Fermi energy which can become\ncomparable to their energy separation. The bands are particularly sensitive to\nin-plane movements of Mo sites far from the Li-sites, where the\ndensity-of-states is highest. The latter fact makes the effect of Li vacancies\non the two bands relatively small. Spin-polarized band results for the ordered\nstructure show a surprisingly large exchange enhancement on the high DOS Mo\nsites. Consequences for spin fluctuations associated with a cell doubling along\nthe conducting direction are discussed.\n", "  The astrophysical factor of the 8B(p,gamma)9C at zero energy, S18(0), is\ndetermined from three-body model analysis of 9C breakup processes. The elastic\nbreakup 208Pb(9C,p8B)208Pb at 65 MeV/nucleon and the one-proton removal\nreaction of 9C at 285 MeV/nucleon on C and Al targets are calculated with the\ncontinuum-discretized coupled-channels method (CDCC) and the eikonal reaction\ntheory (ERT), respectively. The asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of\n9C in the p-8B configuration extracted from the two reactions show good\nconsistency, in contrast to in the previous studies. As a result of the present\nanalysis, S18(0) = 66 \\pm 10 eVb is obtained.\n", "  We introduce a kind of electromagnetism, which we call\nviscoelastic-electromagnetism, to investigate viscoelastic transport phenomena.\nIt is shown that Cartan's formalism of general relativity is essential for\nviscoelastic theory, and then the corresponding electric and magnetic fields\nare regarded as a velocity gradient and a Burgers vector density, respectively.\nAs an application of this formalism, the Streda formula for the Hall viscosity\nis obtained.\n", "  We analyze the disordered Riemannian geometry resulting from random\nperturbations of the Euclidean metric. We focus on geodesics, the paths traced\nout by a particle traveling in this quenched random environment. By taking the\npoint of the view of the particle, we show that the law of its observed\nenvironment is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the random\nmetric, and we provide an explicit form for its Radon-Nikodym derivative. We\nuse this result to prove a \"local Markov property\" along an unbounded geodesic,\ndemonstrating that it eventually encounters any type of geometric phenomenon.\nWe also develop in this paper some general results on conditional Gaussian\nmeasures. Our Main Theorem states that a geodesic chosen with random initial\nconditions (chosen independently of the metric) is almost surely not\nminimizing. To demonstrate this, we show that a minimizing geodesic is\nguaranteed to eventually pass over a certain \"bump surface,\" which locally has\nconstant positive curvature. By using Jacobi fields, we show that this is\nsufficient to destabilize the minimizing property.\n", "  We study the proposal by Bredberg et al. (1006.1902), where the fluid is\ndefined by the Brown-York tensor on a timelike surface at r=r_c in black hole\nbackgrounds. We consider both Rindler space and the Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS)\nblack hole. The former describes an incompressible fluid, whereas the latter\ndescribes the vanishing bulk viscosity at arbitrary r_c, but these two results\ndo not contradict with each other. We also find an interesting \"coincidence\"\nwith the black hole membrane paradigm which gives a negative bulk viscosity. In\norder to show these results, we rewrite the hydrodynamic stress tensor via\nmetric perturbations using the conservation equation. The resulting expressions\nare suitable to compare with the Brown-York tensor.\n", "  The quark-hadron phase transition at finite temperature and baryon chemical\npotential is investigated in an extended NJL model with scalar-vector\neight-point interaction by comparing the pressure of symmetric nuclear matter\nwith that of the quark matter. As a result, the extended NJL phase diagram is\nobtained in the temperature-baryon chemical potential plane and the effects of\nthe scalar-vector coupling constant G_{sv}^q on the chiral phase transition are\nsummarized. It is shown that a quarkyonic-like phase in which the chiral\nsymmetry is restored but the elementary excitation modes are nucleonic appears\njust before deconfinement in this model.\n", "  We argue that 6d N=(2,0) theory on S^1 x S^3 x C_2 reduces to the 2d\nq-deformed Yang-Mills on C_2 at finite area, as a small extension to the result\nof Gadde, Rastelli, Razamat and Yan. This is done by computing the partition\nfunction on S^1 x S^3 of 4d N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma model on\nT^*G_C, which gives the propagator of the 2d Yang-Mills.\n", "  The production cross section of electrons from semileptonic decays of beauty\nhadrons was measured at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.8) in the transverse momentum\nrange $1 < p_{\\rm T} < 8$ Gev/$c$ with the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC in\npp collisions at a center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV using an integrated\nluminosity of 2.2 nb$^{-1}$. Electrons from beauty hadron decays were selected\nbased on the displacement of the decay vertex from the collision vertex. A\nperturbative QCD calculation agrees with the measurement within uncertainties.\nThe data were extrapolated to the full phase space to determine the total cross\nsection for the production of beauty quark-antiquark pairs.\n", "  We demonstrate that in iron-based superconductors, the extended S_{+-} SC\nstate coexists with the d_{x^2-y^2} state under generic conditions. The mixed\nS_{+-} + d_{x^2-y^2} SC is a natural nematic state in which the tetragonal\nsymmetry C_4 is broken to C_2 explaining puzzling findings of nematic SC in\nFeSe films [Science 332, 1410 (2011)]. Moreover, we report the possibility of a\nfirst order transition at low-T from the nematic S_{+-} + d_{x^2-y^2} state to\nthe pure d_{x^2-y^2} state induced by the Zeeman magnetic field proposing an\noriginal experimental strategy for identifying our mixed nematic state in FeSe\nfilms. Extrapolating our findings, we argue that nematicity in non\nsuperconducting states of underdoped and undoped pnictides may reflect mixed\nS_{+-} + d_{x^2-y^2} Density Wave states.\n", "  Recently we have shown that (3+1)-dimensional expanding universe appears\ndynamically and uniquely from the Lorentzian version of the IIB matrix model,\nwhich is considered as a nonperturbative formulation of superstring theory.\nSimilarly, it is possible that the Standard Model appears uniquely at the\nelectroweak scale from the same model at late times. In order to pursue such a\npossibility, we discuss how to derive the effective local field theory for the\nmassless modes that appear at late times in the same formulation. As a concrete\nexample, we consider the massless modes associated with the spontaneous\nbreaking of (9+1)-dimensional Poincare symmetry and supersymmetry.\n", "  We identify a parameter region where the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs\nboson resides in $124.4-126.8$ GeV, and at the same time the degree of tuning a\nHiggsino-mass parameter (so-called $\\mu$-parameter) is relaxed above 10% in the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) with soft supersymmetry breaking\nterms, by solving the full set of one-loop renormalization group equations\nnumerically. It is found that certain nonuniversal values of gaugino-mass\nparameters at the so-called grand unification theory (GUT) scale $\\sim 10^{16}$\nGeV are important ingredients for the MSSM to predict, without a severe\nfine-tuning, the Higgs boson mass $\\sim 125$ GeV indicated by recent\nobservations at the Large Hadron Collider. We also show a typical superparticle\nspectrum in this parameter region.\n", "  Massless matter fields and non-Abelian gauge fields are localized on domain\nwalls in a (4+1)-dimensional $U(N)_c$ gauge theory with $SU(N)_{L}\\times\nSU(N)_{R}\\times U(1)_{A}$ flavor symmetry. We also introduce $SU(N)_{L+R}$\nflavor gauge fields and a scalar-field-dependent gauge coupling, which provides\nmassless non-Abelian gauge fields localized on the wall. We find a chiral\nLagrangian interacting minimally with the non-Abelian gauge field together with\nnonlinear interactions of moduli fields as the (3+1)-dimensional effective\nfield theory up to the second order of derivatives. Our result provides a step\ntowards a realistic model building of brane-world scenario using topological\nsolitons.\n", "  We construct supersymmetric theories on the SU(3)xU(1) symmetric squashed\nfive-sphere with 2, 4, 6, and 12 supercharges. We first determine the Killing\nequation by dimensional reduction from 6d, and use Noether procedure to\nconstruct actions. The supersymmetric Yang-Mills action is straightforwardly\nobtained from the supersymmetric Chern-Simons action by using a supersymmetry\npreserving constant vector multiplet.\n", "  We consider the femto-lensing due to a cosmic string. If a cosmic string with\nthe deficit angle $\\Delta\\sim 100$ [femto-arcsec] $\\sim10^{-18}$ [rad] exists\naround the line of sight to a gamma-ray burst, we may observe characteristic\ninterference patterns caused by gravitational lensing in the energy spectrum of\nthe gamma-ray burst. This \"femto-lensing\" event was first proposed as a tool to\nprobe small mass primordial black holes. In this paper, we propose use of the\nfemto-lensing to probe cosmic strings with extremely small tension.\nObservability conditions and the event rate are discussed. Differences between\nthe cases of a point mass and a cosmic string are presented.\n", "  The primordial perturbation is widely accepted to be generated through the\nvacuum fluctuation of the scalar field which drives inflation. It is, however,\nnot completely clear what is the natural vacuum in the inflationary universe\nparticularly in the presence of non-linear interactions. In this series of\npapers, we will address this issue, focusing on the condition required for the\nremoval of the divergence from the infrared (IR) contribution to loop diagrams.\nWe show that requesting the gauge invariance in the local observable universe\nguarantees the IR regularity of the loop corrections beginning with a simple\ninitial state. In our previous works, the IR regularity condition was discussed\nusing the slow roll expansion, which restricts the background evolution of the\ninflationary universe. We will show more generally that requesting the gauge\ninvariance/the IR regularity leads to non-trivial constraints on the allowed\nquantum states.\n", "  The Eisert et al. maximally entangled quantum game is studied within the\nframework of (elementary) group theory. It is shown that the game can be\ndescribed in terms of real Hilbert space of states. It is also shown that the\ncrucial properties of the maximally entangled case, like quaternionic structure\nand the existence, to any given strategy, the corresponding counterstrategy,\nresult from the existence of large stability subgroup of initial state of the\ngame.\n", "  We examine the stability of charged Lovelock black hole solutions under\nvector type and scalar type perturbations. We find the suitable master\nvariables for the stability analysis; the equations for these variables are the\nSchrodinger type equations with two components and these Schrodinger operators\nare symmetric. By these master equations, we show that charged Lovelock Black\nholes are stable under vector type perturbations. For scalar type\nperturbations, we show the criteria for the instability and check these\nnumerically. In our previous paper, we have shown that nearly extremal black\nholes have the instability under tensor type perturbations. In this paper, we\nfind that black holes with small charge have the instability under scalar type\nperturbations even if they have relatively large mass.\n", "  We consider bosonic open string field theory in marginally deformed\nbackgrounds, which is obtained by expanding the string field around the\nidentity-based solutions associated with marginal deformations. We find a new\nset of string fields which satisfies the KBc algebra, but the nilpotent kinetic\noperator is that of the theory expanded around the identity-based marginal\nsolution. By use of these string fields, we construct the tachyon vaccum\nsolution in marginally deformed backgrounds. The vacuum energy density is\nequivalent to that of the tachyon vacuum without marginal deformations. The\ngauge invariant overlap is changed according to the effect of marginal\ndeformations, as expected from known results in CFT. These results suggest that\nthe vacuum energy is zero for the identity-based marginal solutions in the\noriginal theory.\n", "  We propose a new model which can naturally explain origins of fermion\ngenerations, quark mass hierarchy, and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix\nsimultaneously from geometry of an extra dimension. We take the extra dimension\nto be an interval with point interactions, which are additional boundary points\nin the bulk space of the interval. Because of the Dirichlet boundary condition\nfor fermion at the positions of point interactions, profiles of chiral fermion\nzero modes are split and localized, and then we can realize three generations\nfrom each five-dimensional Dirac fermion. Our model allows fermion flavor\nmixing but the form of non-diagonal elements of fermion mass matrices is found\nto be severely restricted due to geometry of the extra dimension. The Robin\nboundary condition for a scalar leads to an extra coordinate-dependent vacuum\nexpectation value, which can naturally explain the fermion mass hierarchy.\n", "  In general relativity, it has been shown that the effective gravitational\nstress-energy tensor for short-wavelength metric perturbations acts just like\nthat for a radiation fluid, and thus, in particular, cannot provide any effects\nthat mimic dark energy. However, it is far from obvious if this property of the\neffective gravitational stress-energy tensor is a specific nature held only in\nthe Einstein gravity, or holds also in other theories of gravity. In\nparticular, when considering modified gravity theories that involve higher\norder derivative terms, one may expect to have some non-negligible effects\narising from higher order derivatives of short-wavelength perturbations. In\nthis paper, we argue this is not the case at least in the cosmological context.\nWe show that when the background, or coarse-grained metric averaged over\nseveral wavelengths has FLRW symmetry, the effective gravitational\nstress-energy tensor for metric perturbations of a cosmological model in a\nsimple class of f(R) gravity theories, as well as that obtained in the\ncorresponding scalar-tensor theory, takes a similar form to that in general\nrelativity and is in fact traceless, hence acting again like a radiation fluid.\n", "  New mixing structures between chiral generations of elementary particles at\nlow energy are shown in a vectorlike model with a horizontal symmetry SU(1,1).\nIn this framework the chiral model including odd number chiral generations is\nrealized via the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the horizontal symmetry. It\nis shown that the Yukawa coupling matrices of chiral generations have naturally\nhierarchical patterns, and in some cases the overall factors of their Yukawa\ncoupling matrices, e.g. the Yukawa coupling constants of the bottom quark and\ntau lepton are naturally suppressed.\n", "  For almost thirty years, mode-coupling theory has been the most widely\ndiscussed and used but also the most controversial theory of the glass\ntransition. In this paper we briefly review the reasons for both its popularity\nand its controversy. We emphasize the need for the development of approaches\nthat would be able to evaluate corrections to and extensions of the existing\n(standard) mode-coupling theory. Next, we review our diagrammatic formulation\nof the dynamics of interacting Brownian particles. We show that within this\napproach the standard mode-coupling theory can be derived in a very simple way.\nFinally, we use our diagrammatic approach to calculate two corrections to the\nmode-coupling theory's expression for the so-called irreducible memory\nfunction. These corrections involve re-summations of well defined classes of\nnon-mode-coupling diagrams.\n", "  The present paper is devoted to the study of resonances for one-dimensional\nquantum systems with a potential that is the restriction to some large box of\nan ergodic potential. For discrete models both on a half-line and on the whole\nline, we study the distributions of the resonances in the limit when the size\nof the box where the potential does not vanish goes to infinity. For periodic\nand random potentials, we analyze how the spectral theory of the limit operator\ninfluences the distribution of the resonances.\n", "  The recent discovery of the Higgs-like particle at around 126 GeV has given\nus a big hint towards the origin of the Higgs potential. Especially the running\nquartic coupling vanishes near the Planck scale, which indicates a possible\nlink between the physics in the electroweak and the Planck scales. Motivated by\nthis and the hierarchy problem, we investigate a possibility that the Higgs has\na flat potential at the Planck scale. In particular, we study the RG analysis\nof the B-L extension of the standard model with a classical conformality. The\nB-L symmetry is radiatively broken at the TeV scale via the Coleman-Weinberg\nmechanism. The electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by a radiatively\ngenerated scalar mixing so that its scale 246 GeV is dynamically related with\nthe B-L breaking scale at TeV. The Higgs boson mass is given at the border of\nthe stability bound,which is lowered by a few GeV from the SM by the effect of\nthe B-L gauge interaction.\n", "  The $K^- d \\to \\pi YN$reaction is theoretically studied so as to investigate\nthe $K^{-}$-induced production of the hyperon resonances $\\Sigma (1385)$ and\n$\\Lambda (1405)$. For this purpose we take into account the p-wave amplitudes\nfor the meson-baryon two-body scatterings as well as the s-wave amplitudes. Due\nto the fact that the hyperon resonances are selectively produced from the\n$\\bar{K} N$ channel in this reaction, the $\\Lambda (1405)$ peak appears at 1420\nMeV, which implies that $\\Lambda (1405)$ and $\\Sigma (1385)$ could be\nseparately seen in the missing mass spectrum of the emitted nucleon in the\n$K^{-} d \\to n X$ reaction. The $\\pi Y$ invariant mass spectrum in this study\nis consistent with experimental data both for $\\Sigma (1385)$ and $\\Lambda\n(1405)$. The pion exchange contributions are also included and are found to\ngive smooth background without distorting the peak structure of the hyperon\nresonances.\n", "  We compute the index of 6d N=(1,0) theories on S^5 x R containing vector and\nhypermultiplets. We only consider the perturbative sector without instantons.\nBy compactifying R to S^1 with a twisted boundary condition and taking the\nsmall radius limit, we derive the perturbative partition function on a squashed\nS^5. The 1-loop partition function is represented in a simple form with the\ntriple sine function.\n", "  We study a radion model for inflation and density perturbation identifying\nthe scalar field arising from the five-dimensional gravity on $M_4 x S^1$ with\nthe inflaton. The inflaton potential arising from 5D graviton and matter\none-loop effects is shown to possess the desirable slow-roll property. This\nradion model contains only a small number of parameters and there is an ample\nparameter region which reproduces (without fine-tuning) all precision\nastrophysical data.\n", "  We have derived fourth-order perturbative equations in Lagrangian\nperturbation theory for a cosmological dust fluid. These equations are derived\nunder the supposition of Newtonian cosmology in the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker Universe model. Even if we consider the\nlongitudinal mode in the first-order perturbation, the transverse mode appears\nin the third-order perturbation. Furthermore, in this case, six\nlongitudinal-mode equations and four transverse-mode equations appear in the\nfourth-order perturbation. The application of the fourth-order perturbation\nleads to a precise prediction of the large-scale structure.\n", "  We consider the quantum state seen by an observer in the diamond-shaped\nregion, which is a globally hyperbolic open submanifold of the Minkowski\nspace-time. It is known from the operator-algebraic argument that the vacuum\nstate of the quantum field transforming covariantly under the conformal group\nlooks like a thermal state on the von Neumann algebra generated by the field\noperators on the diamond-shaped region of the Minkowski space-time. Here, we\nfind, in the case of the free massless Hermitian scalar field in the\n2-dimensional Minkowski space-time, that such a state can in fact be identified\nwith a certain entangled quantum state. By doing this, we obtain the\nthermodynamic quantities such as the Casimir energy and the von Neumann entropy\nof the thermal state in the diamond-shaped region, and show that the Bekenstein\nbound for the entropy-to-energy ratio is saturated. We further speculate on a\npossible information-theoretic interpretation of the entropy in terms of the\nprobability density functions naturally determined from the Tomita-Takesaki\nmodular flow in the diamond-shaped region.\n", "  We solve the equation of motion of boundary string field theory allowing\ngeneric boundary operators quadratic in $X$, and explore string theory\nnon-perturbative vacua with massive state condensation. Using numerical\nanalysis, a large number of new solutions are found. Their energies turn out to\ndistribute densely in the range between the D-brane tension and the energy of\nthe tachyon vacuum. We discuss an interpretation of these solutions as\nperturbative closed string states. From the cosmological point of view, the\ndistribution of the energies can be regarded as the so-called landscape of\nstring theory, as we have a vast number of non-perturbative string theory\nsolutions including one with small vacuum energy.\n", "  We obtain new exact solutions in Einstein Gauss-Bonnet gravity of every odd\ndimension higher than three. These new spacetimes are stationary but\nnon-static, coupled with the Maxwell field, and asymptotic AdS at least\nlocally. In order to investigate such new solutions, we adopt the\ncharacteristic ansatz for the metric form. It is presented that the local\nexpression of our metric possesses some interesting properties, in which the\nmost peculiar one is what is called Sasakian structure. Somewhat intricate\nrelationship is unveiled between our solution and the already-known rotating\nsolution which has been only one so far in that purely gravitational theory. We\nconfirm the validity of the rotating spacetime with the evaluation of the\nfinite angular momentum.\n", "  We study the cosmic no-hair in the presence of spin-2 matter, i.e. in\nbimetric gravity. We obtain stable de Sitter solutions with the cosmological\nconstant in the physical sector and find an evidence that the cosmic no-hair is\ncorrect. In the presence of the other cosmological constant, there are two\nbranches of de Sitter solutions. Under anisotropic perturbations, one of them\nis always stable and there is no violation of the cosmic no-hair at the linear\nlevel. The stability of the other branch depends on parameters and the cosmic\nno-hair can be violated in general. Remarkably, the bifurcation point of two\nbranches exactly coincides with the Higuchi bound. It turns out that there\nexists a de Sitter solution for which the cosmic no-hair holds at the linear\nlevel and the effective mass for the anisotropic perturbations is above the\nHiguchi bound.\n", "  Some of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on exceptional groups (E7\nor E8) are known to yield almost minimal necessary content of matter fields for\nphenomenological model building, including three chiral families and a Higgs\nmultiplet. We explore a possible realization of such a family unification in\nheterotic string theory, where the spontaneously broken symmetry that we focus\non is the one associated with the change of global orientation of the spin\nbundle embedded in the gauge bundle, which cannot be ignored in the presence of\na magnetic source of the B field. We show in a simple model that it indeed\ngives rise to chiral matter fields on the defect similarly to the domain-wall\nfermions, and compare the chiral zero mode spectrum with the sigma model. The\nsetup is reduced to a system similar to that postulated in the orbifold GUT or\nthe grand gauge-Higgs unification model, where the origin of Z2 identification\nis accounted for as arising from the bolt of the Atiyah-Hitchin manifold.\n", "  The supersymmetric extension of the standard model contains an intrinsic\nsourceof CP violation mediated by the charginos. As an effect, both CP-even and\nCP-odd final states could be observed in the Higgs boson decay into two photons\nwhose evidences were reported recently.\n", "  Non-perturbative renormalization group approach to the dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking is an effective method which can accommodate beyond the\nladder (mean filed) approximation. The usual method relying on the field\noperator expansion suffers explosive behaviors of the 4-fermi coupling\nconstant, which prevent us from evaluating the physical quantities in the\nbroken phase. In order to overcome this difficulty, we solve the flow equation\ndirectly as a partial differential equation and calculate the dynamical mass\nand the chiral condensates. Also we formulate a beyond the ladder equation and\nit gives almost gauge independent results for the chiral condensates.\n", "  We report the nonperturbative behavior of the twisted Polyakov loop (TPL)\ncoupling constant for the SU(3) gauge theories defined by the ratio of Polyakov\nloop correlators in finite volume with twisted boundary condition. We reveal\nthe vacuum structures and the phase structure for the lattice gauge theory with\nthe twisted boundary condition. Carrying out the numerical simulations, we\ndetermine the nonperturbative running coupling constant in this renormalization\nscheme for the quenched QCD and Nf=12 SU(3) gauge theories. At first, we study\nthe quenched QCD theory using the plaquette gauge action. The TPL coupling\nconstant has a fake fixed point in the confinement phase. We discuss this fake\nfixed point of the TPL scheme and obtain the nonperturbative running coupling\nconstant in the deconfinement phase, where the magnitude of the Polyakov loop\nshows the nonzero values. We also investigate the system coupled to fundamental\nfermions. Since we use the naive staggered fermion with the twisted boundary\ncondition in our simulation, only multiples of 12 are allowed for the number of\nflavors. According to the perturbative two loop analysis, the Nf=12 SU(3) gauge\ntheory might have a conformal fixed point in the infrared region. However, the\nrecent lattice studies show controversial results for the existence of the\nfixed point. We point out possible problems in previous works, and present our\ncareful study. Finally, we find the infrared fixed point (IRFP) and discuss the\nrobustness of the nontrivial IRFP of many flavor system under the change of the\nanalysis method. A part of preliminary results was reported in the proceedings\n[1, 2] and the letter paper [3]. In this paper we include a review of these\nresults and give a final conclusion for the existence of IRFP of SU(3) Nf = 12\nmassless theory using the updated data.\n", "  Humans are often incapable of precisely identifying and implementing the\ndesired control strategy in controlling unstable dynamical systems. That is,\nthe operator of a dynamical system treats the current control effort as\nacceptable even if it deviates slightly from the desired value, and starts\ncorrecting the actions only when the deviation has become evident. We argue\nthat the standard Newtonian approach does not allow to model such behavior.\nInstead, the physical phase space of a controlled system should be extended\nwith an independent phase variable characterizing the operator motivated\nactions. The proposed approach is illustrated via a simple non-Newtonian model\ncapturing the operators fuzzy perception of their own actions. The properties\nof the model are investigated analytically and numerically; the results confirm\nthat the extended phase space may aid in capturing the intricate dynamical\nproperties of human-controlled systems.\n", "  We derive generating functions, valid to next-to-double logarithmic accuracy,\nfor QCD jet rates according to the inclusive forms of the kt, Cambridge/Aachen\nand anti-kt algorithms, which are equivalent at this level of accuracy. We\ncompare the analytical results with jet rates and average jet multiplicities\nfrom the SHERPA event generator, and study the transition between Poisson-like\nand staircase-like behaviour of jet ratios.\n", "  We present neutrino mass matrix textures in a minimal framework of the type-I\nseesaw mechanism where two right-handed Majorana neutrinos are introduced in\norder to reproduce experimental results of neutrino oscillations. The textures\ncan lead to experimentally favored leptonic mixing angles described by the\ntri-bimaximal mixing with one additional rotation. We present minimal and next\nto minimal textures for the normal mass hierarchy case in a context of the\ntexture zero. A minimal texture in the inverted hierarchy case is also\nconstructed, which does not have any vanishing entries in a Dirac neutrino mass\nmatrix. We also discuss some cases that model parameters in the textures are\nsupposed to be a neutrino mass ratio and/or the Cabibbo angle. Predicted\nregions of mixing angles, a leptonic CP-violation parameter, and an effective\nmass for the neutrino-less double beta decay are presented in all textures.\n", "  Correlations of two charged identical kaons (${\\rm K}^{\\rm ch}{\\rm K}^{\\rm\nch}$) are measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV by the ALICE experiment\nat the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One-dimensional ${\\rm K}^{\\rm ch}{\\rm\nK}^{\\rm ch}$ correlation functions are constructed in three multiplicity and\nfour transverse momentum ranges. The ${\\rm K}^{\\rm ch}{\\rm K}^{\\rm ch}$\nfemtoscopic source parameters $R$ and $\\lambda$ are extracted. The ${\\rm\nK}^{\\rm ch}{\\rm K}^{\\rm ch}$ correlations show a slight increase of femtoscopic\nradii with increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease of radii with\nincreasing transverse momentum. These trends are similar to the ones observed\nfor $\\pi \\pi$ and ${\\rm K}^0_{\\rm s}{\\rm K}^0_{\\rm s}$ correlations in pp and\nheavy-ion collisions. However at high multiplicities, there is an indication\nthat the one-dimensional correlation radii for charged kaons are larger than\nthose for pions in contrast to what was observed in heavy-ion collisions at\nRHIC.\n", "  On the basis of the percolation picture from the hadronic phase with hyperons\nto the quark phase with strangeness, we construct a new equation of state (EOS)\nwith the pressure interpolated as a function of the baryon density. The maximum\nmass of neutron stars can exceed $2M_{\\odot}$ if the following two conditions\nare satisfied; (i) the crossover from the hadronic matter to the quark matter\ntakes place at around three times the normal nuclear matter density, and (ii)\nthe quark matter is strongly interacting in the crossover region and has stiff\nequation of state. This is in contrast to the conventional approach assuming\nthe first order phase transition in which the EOS becomes always soft due to\nthe presence of the quark matter at high density. Although the choice of the\nhadronic EOS does not affect the above conclusion on the maximum mass, the\nthree-body force among nucleons and hyperons plays an essential role for the\nonset of the hyperon mixing and the cooling of neutron stars.\n", "  There is a long-standing problem on the linearly energy-weighted sum of the\nexcitation strengths in the relativistic field theory and nuclear models: The\nsum value should be positively definite, while its naive calculation using the\ncurrent commutator or the double commutator of the excitation operator with\nDirac Hamiltonian yields the value to vanish. This paradoxical contradiction is\nsolved in an analytic way.\n", "  We investigate the initial state of the inflationary universe. In our recent\npublications, we showed that requesting the gauge invariance in the local\nobservable universe to the initial state guarantees the infrared (IR)\nregularity of loop corrections in a general single clock inflation. Following\nthis study, in this paper, we show that choosing the Euclidean vacuum ensures\nthe gauge invariance in the local universe and hence the IR regularity of loop\ncorrections. It has been suggested that loop corrections to inflationary\nperturbations may yield the secular growth, which can lead to the break down of\nthe perturbative analysis in an extremely long term inflation. The absence of\nthe secular growth has been claimed by picking up only the IR contributions,\nwhich we think is incomplete because the non-IR modes which are comparable to\nor smaller than the Hubble scale potentially can contribute to the secular\ngrowth. We prove the absence of the secular growth without neglecting these\nnon-IR modes to a certain order in the perturbative expansion. We also discuss\nhow the regularity of the n-point functions for the genuinely gauge invariant\nvariable constrains the initial states of the inflationary universe. These\nresults apply in a fully general single field model of inflation.\n", "  A uniformly accelerated detector (Unruh detector) in the Minkowski vacuum is\nexcited as if it is exposed to the thermal bath with temperature proportional\nto its acceleration. In the inertial frame, since both of an excitation and a\ndeexcitation of the detector are accompanied by emission of radiation into the\nMinkowski vacuum, one may suspect that the Unruh detector emits radiation like\nthe Larmor radiation from an accelerated charged particle. However, it is known\nthat the radiation is miraculously cancelled by a quantum interference effect.\nIn this paper, we investigate under what condition the radiation cancels out.\nWe first show that the cancellation occurs if the Green function satisfies a\nrelation similar to the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. We then study\ntwo examples, Unruh detectors in the 3+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime and in\nthe de Sitter spacetime. In both cases, the relation holds only in a restricted\nregion of the spacetime, but the radiation is cancelled in the whole spacetime.\nHence the KMS-like relation is necessary but not sufficient for the\ncancellation to occur.\n", "  We derive the classical equations of hydrodynamic type (Euler equation and\nthe continuity equation) from which the Schrodinger equation follows as a limit\ncase. It is shown that the statistical ensemble corresponding to quantum system\nand described by the Schrodinger equation, can be considered as an inviscid gas\nobeying the ideal gas law with quickly oscillating sign-alternating\ntemperature. This statistical ensemble performs the complex movements\nconsisting of smooth average movement and fast oscillations. It is shown that\naverage movements of statistical ensemble are described by Schrodinger\nequation. A model of quantum motion within the limits of classical mechanics\nwhich corresponds to the considered hydrodynamic system is suggested.\n", "  This paper discusses the feasibility of testing Bell's inequality with the\ncharmonium decays \\eta_c -> \\Lambda \\Lambda, \\chi_{c0} -> \\Lambda\\Lambda and\nJ/\\Psi -> \\Lambda\\Lambda. We develop a new formulation of the Bell's inequality\nrepresented with particles' momenta which can be measured definitely in\nexperiment and seek if it violates in these decays. It is illustrated that the\n\\eta_c channel and the \\chi_{c0} channel maximally violate Bell's inequality,\nwhile the J/\\Psi channel gives no inconsistency with it. Simulations dealing\nwith experimental aspects are also implemented. The expected statistical\nfluctuations and achievable significance are estimated as a function of sample\nsize.\n", "  Relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei, galactic microquasars, and\ngamma-ray bursts are widely considered to be magnetohydrodynamically driven by\nblack hole accretion systems, although conversion mechanism from Poynting into\nparticle kinetic energy flux is still open. Recent detailed numerical and\nanalytical studies of global structures of steady, axisymmetric\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows with specific boundary conditions have not\nreproduced as rapid an energy conversion as required by observations. In order\nto find more suitable boundary conditions, we focus on the flow along a\npoloidal magnetic field line just inside the external boundary, without\ntreating transfield force balance in detail. We find some examples of the\npoloidal field structure and corresponding external pressure profile for an\nefficient and rapid energy conversion as required by observations, and that the\nrapid acceleration requires a rapid decrease of the external pressure above the\naccretion disk. We also clarify the differences between the fast magnetosonic\npoint of the MHD flow and the sonic point of de Laval nozzle.\n", "  The classical Cartan-Helgason theorem characterises finite-dimensional\nspherical representations of reductive Lie groups in terms of their highest\nweights. We generalise the theorem to the case of a reductive symmetric\nsupergroup pair $(G,K)$ of even type. Along the way, we compute the\nHarish-Chandra $c$-function of the symmetric superspace $G/K$. By way of an\napplication, we show that all spherical representations are self-dual in type\nAIII|AIII.\n", "  The product of gauge fields generated by the Yang-Mills gradient flow for\npositive flow times does not exhibit the coincidence-point singularity and a\nlocal product is thus independent of the regularization. Such a local product\ncan furthermore be expanded by renormalized local operators at zero flow time\nwith finite coefficients that are governed by renormalization group equations.\nUsing these facts, we derive a formula that relates the small flow-time\nbehavior of certain gauge-invariant local products and the correctly-normalized\nconserved energy-momentum tensor in the Yang-Mills theory. Our formula provides\na possible method to compute the correlation functions of a well-defined\nenergy-momentum tensor by using lattice regularization and Monte Carlo\nsimulation.\n", "  We consider the pionic atom spectroscopy by the (d,3He) reaction on an\nodd-neutron nuclear target in this article, which has not been investigated so\nfar. In the (d,3He) reaction on the odd-neutron nuclear target, we can observe\nthe pionic states in the even-neutron nucleus with spin-parity 0+. We expect\nthat this pionic state does not have the additional shifts due to the effects\nof the residual interaction between neutron-hole and pionic states. For the\neven-neutron nuclear target cases, we may have to take into account the\nresidual interaction effects to deduce the binding energies of the pionic\nstates precisely from the high precision experimental data since the final\npionic states are the pion-particle plus neutron-hole states. Thus, in addition\nto widening the domain of the pionic atom spectroscopy in nuclear chart, the\npresent study of the (d,3He) reaction on the odd-neutron target is considered\nto be important to deduce extremely precise information on the binding energies\nof the observed pionic states, and to know the pion properties and aspects of\nthe symmetries of the strong interaction at finite density. We modify the\nformula of the even-even nuclear target case to study the pionic atom formation\nspectra on the even-odd nuclear target and show the numerical results of 117Sn\ntarget case. This experiment will be performed at RIBF/RIKEN in near future.\n", "  Eigenvalues of the Breit Equation {eqnarray*} [(\\vec{\\alpha}_{1} \\vec{p} +\n\\beta_{1}m)_{\\alpha \\alpha^{\\prime}} \\delta_{\\beta \\beta^{\\prime}} +\n\\delta_{\\alpha \\alpha^{\\prime}} (-\\vec{\\alpha}_{2} \\vec{p} + \\beta_{2}M)_{\\beta\n\\beta^{\\prime}} - \\frac{e^{2}}{r} \\delta_{\\alpha \\alpha^{\\prime}} \\delta_{\\beta\n\\beta^{\\prime}}] \\Psi_{\\alpha^{\\prime} \\beta^{\\prime}} = E \\Psi_{\\alpha \\beta},\n{eqnarray*} in which only the static Coulomb potential is considered, have been\nfound. Here the detailed discussion on the simple caces, $^{1}S_{0},\\ m=M$ and\n$m \\neq M$ is given deriving the exact energy eigenvalues. The $\\alpha^2$\nexpansion is used to find radial wave functions. The leading term is given by\nclassical Coulomb wave function. The technique used here can be applied to\nother cases.\n", "  We predict new particles at the Tera scale based on the assumptions that the\nstandard model gauge interactions are unified around the gravitational scale\nwith a big desert and new particles originate from hypermultiplets as remnants\nof supersymmetry, and propose a theoretical framework at the Tera scale and\nbeyond, that has predictability.\n", "  We make a four-algebraic extension of the IIB matrix model. The extension can\nbe made by any Lie 4-algebra. The four-algebraic model has the same\nsupersymmetry as the IIB matrix model, and hence as type IIB superstring\ntheory. The four-algebraic model contains twelve bosonic matrices; two of these\nwill be identified with two extra dimensions that characterize F-theory. We\nconstruct a Lie 4-algebra that incorporates $u(N)$ Lie algebra and analyze the\nmodel explicitly by choosing it. We have three phases in the model with that\nspecific algebra. In the first phase, it reduces to the original IIB matrix\nmodel. In the second phase, it reduces to a simple supersymmetric model. In the\nthird phase, it reduces to a model that describes only the dynamics of the two\nmatrices representing the torus.\n", "  A system in which the free part of the action possesses a gauge symmetry that\nis not respected by the interacting part presents problems when quantized. We\nillustrate how the Dirac constraint formalism can be used to address this\ndifficulty by considering an antisymmetric tensor field interacting with a\nspinor field.\n", "  The performance of a muon radiography system designed to image the inner\nstructure of a nuclear plant located at a distance of 64 m was evaluated. We\nconcluded absence of the fuel in the pressure vessel during the measurement\nperiod and succeeded in profiling the fuel material placed in the storage pool.\nThe obtained data also demonstrated the sensitivity of the system to water\nlevel changes in the reactor well and the dryer-separator pool. It is expected\nthat the system could reconstruct a 2 m cubic fuel object easily. By operating\nmultiple systems, typically four identical systems, viewing the reactor from\ndifferent directions simultaneously, detection of a 1 m cubic object should\nalso be achievable within a few month period.\n", "  We investigate characteristic features of realistic parameter choice for\nprimordial inflation with supersymmetric Higgs inflaton as an example of\nparticle physics inflation model. We discuss constraints from observational\nresults and analyze the degree of fine tuning needed to induce slow-roll\ninflation for wide range of soft supersymmetry breaking scale. The observed\namplitude of density fluctuations implies that the minimal fine tuning for the\ncombined electroweak scale and inflaton flatness predicts the spectral index of\n0.950--0.965, which includes the central value from observational data.\n", "  We explore how a frozen background metric affects the mechanical properties\nof planar membranes with a shear modulus. We focus on a special class of\n\"warped membranes\" with a preferred random height profile characterized by\nrandom Gaussian variables $h({\\bf q})$ in Fourier space with zero mean and\nvariance $<|h({\\bf q})|^2> \\sim q^{-d_h}$ and show that in the linear response\nregime the mechanical properties depend dramatically on the system size $L$ for\n$d_h \\ge 2$. Membranes with $d_h=4$ could be produced by flash polymerization\nof lyotropic smectic liquid crystals. Via a self consistent screening\napproximation we find that the renormalized bending rigidity increases as\n$\\kappa_R \\sim L^{(d_h-2)/2}$ for membranes of size $L$, while the Young and\nshear modulii decrease according to $Y_R,\\ \\mu_R \\sim L^{-(d_h-2)/2}$ resulting\nin a universal Poisson ratio. Numerical results show good agreement with\nanalytically determined exponents.\n", "  A novel perturbative method, proposed by Panda {\\it et al.} [1] to solve the\nHelmholtz equation in two dimensions, is extended to three dimensions for\ngeneral boundary surfaces. Although a few numerical works are available in the\nliterature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical\nprescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is\nused to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the\nboundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The\ndeformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation.\nA deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a\nspherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of\nstandard Rayleigh-Schr{\\\"o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed\nequation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at\neach order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which\nmake them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary\nconditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the\nwavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been\ntested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three\ndimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well\nfor these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary\nsurfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and\nalso their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative\nseries for the energy. Direct applications of this method can be found in the\nfield of quantum dots, nuclear physics, acoustical and electromagnetic\ncavities.\n", "  This paper is about the role of Planck's constant, $\\hbar$, in the geometric\nquantization of Poisson manifolds using symplectic groupoids. In order to\nconstruct a strict deformation quantization of a given Poisson manifold, one\ncan use all possible rescalings of the Poisson structure, which can be combined\ninto a single \"Heisenberg-Poisson\" manifold. The new coordinate on this\nmanifold is identified with $\\hbar$. I present an explicit construction for a\nsymplectic groupoid integrating a Heisenberg-Poisson manifold and discuss its\ngeometric quantization. I show that in cases where $\\hbar$ cannot take\narbitrary values, this is enforced by Bohr-Sommerfeld conditions in geometric\nquantization.\n  A Heisenberg-Poisson manifold is defined by linearly rescaling the Poisson\nstructure, so I also discuss nonlinear variations and give an example of\nquantization of a nonintegrable Poisson manifold using a presymplectic\ngroupoid.\n  In appendices, I construct symplectic groupoids integrating a more general\nclass of Heisenberg-Poisson manifolds constructed from Jacobi manifolds and\ndiscuss the parabolic tangent groupoid.\n", "  Unconventional superconductivity (SC) is said to occur when Cooper pair\nformation is dominated by repulsive electron-electron interactions, so that the\nsymmetry of the pair wavefunction is other than isotropic s-wave. The strong,\non-site, repulsive electron-electron interactions that are the proximate cause\nof such superconductivity are more typically drivers of commensurate magnetism.\nIndeed, it is the suppression of commensurate antiferromagnetism (AF) that\nusually allows this type of unconventional superconductivity to emerge.\nImportantly, however, intervening between these AF and SC phases, intertwined\nelectronic ordered phases of an unexpected nature are frequently discovered.\nFor this reason, it has been extremely difficult to distinguish the microscopic\nessence of the correlated superconductivity from the often spectacular\nphenomenology of the intertwined phases. Here we introduce a model conceptual\nframework within which to understand the relationship between antiferromagnetic\nelectron-electron interactions, intertwined ordered phases and correlated\nsuperconductivity. We demonstrate its effectiveness in simultaneously\nexplaining the consequences of antiferromagnetic interactions for the\ncopper-based, iron-based and heavy-fermion superconductors, as well as for\ntheir quite distinct intertwined phases.\n", "  We study the interplay between the isoscalar (T=0) and isovector (T=1)\npairing correlations in N=Z odd-odd nuclei from 14N to 58Cu by using three-body\nmodel calculations. The strong spin-triplet T=0 pairing correlation dominates\nin the ground state of 14N, 18F, 30P, and 58Cu with the spin-parity J^{\\pi}=1+,\nwhich can be well reproduced by the present calculations. The magnetic dipole\nand Gamow-Teller transitions are found to be strong in 18F and 42Sc as a\nmanifestation of SU(4) symmetry in the spin-isospin space. We also discuss the\nspin-quadrupole transitions in these nuclei.\n", "  Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory, a pillar of modern cosmology and astrophysics,\npredicts the existence of a large number of starless dark matter halos\nsurrounding the Milky Way (MW). However, clear observational evidence of these\n\"dark\" substructures remains elusive. Here, we present a detection method based\non the small, but detectable, velocity changes that an orbiting substructure\nimposes on the stars in the MW disk. Using high-resolution numerical\nsimulations we estimate that the new space telescope Gaia should detect the\nkinematic signatures of a few starless substructures provided the CDM paradigm\nholds. Such a measurement will provide unprecedented constraints on the\nprimordial matter power spectrum at low-mass scales and offer a new handle onto\nthe particle physics properties of dark matter.\n", "  We study N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories on squashed 3-sphere and S^1xS^2.\nRecent studies have shown that the partition functions in a class of N=2\ntheories have factorized forms in terms of vortex and anti-vortex partition\nfunctions by explicitly evaluating matrix integrals obtained from Coulomb\nbranch localization. We directly derive this structure by performing Higgs\nbranch localization. It turns out that more general N=2 theories have this\nfactorization property. We also discuss the factorization of supersymmetric\nWilson loop.\n", "  We explore thermal fluctuations of thin planar membranes with a frozen\nspatially-varying background metric and a shear modulus. We focus on a special\nclass of $D$-dimensional ``warped membranes'' embedded in a $d-$dimensional\nspace with $d\\ge D+1$ and a preferred height profile characterized by quenched\nrandom Gaussian variables $\\{h_\\alpha({\\bf q})\\}$, $\\alpha=D+1,\\ldots, d$, in\nFourier space with zero mean and a power law variance $\\overline{ h_\\alpha({\\bf\nq}_1) h_\\beta({\\bf q}_2) } \\sim \\delta_{\\alpha, \\beta} \\, \\delta_{{\\bf q}_1,\n-{\\bf q}_2} \\, q_1^{-d_h}$. The case $D=2$, $d=3$ with $d_h = 4$ could be\nrealized by flash polymerizing lyotropic smectic liquid crystals. For $D <\n\\max\\{4, d_h\\}$ the elastic constants are non-trivially renormalized and become\nscale dependent. Via a self consistent screening approximation we find that the\nrenormalized bending rigidity increases for small wavevectors ${{\\bf q}}$ as\n$\\kappa_R \\sim q^{-\\eta_f}$, while the in-hyperplane elastic constants decrease\naccording to $\\lambda_R,\\ \\mu_R \\sim q^{+\\eta_u}$. The quenched background\nmetric is relevant (irelevant) for warped membranes characterized by exponent\n$d_h > 4 - \\eta_f^{(F)}$ ($d_h < 4 - \\eta_f^{(F)}$), where $\\eta_f^{(F)}$ is\nthe scaling exponent for tethered surfaces with a flat background metric, and\nthe scaling exponents are related through $\\eta_u + \\eta_f = d_h - D$ ($\\eta_u\n+ 2 \\eta_f=4-D$).\n", "  We study the Heisenberg-Kitaev chain in order to uncover the interplay\nbetween two qualitatively different integrable points in the physics of heat\ntransport in one dimension. Focusing on high temperatures and using analytical\nas well as numerical approaches within linear response theory, we explore\nseveral directions in parameter space including exchange-coupling ratios,\nanisotropies, and external magnetic fields. We show the emergence of purely\nballistic energy transport at all integrable points, manifest in pronounced\nDrude weights and low-frequency suppression of regular-conductivity\ncontributions. Moreover, off integrability, we find extended quantum chaotic\nregions with vanishing Drude weights and well-defined DC conductivities. In the\nvicinity of the Kitaev point, we observe clear signatures of the topological\ngap in the response function. This gap coexists with a nonzero Drude weight in\nthe Kitaev chain.\n", "  We propose a new method for studying the early universe in the Lorentzian\nversion of the IIB matrix model, which is considered to be a nonperturbative\nformulation of superstring theory. This method is based on the idea of\nrenormalization group, and it enables us to study the time-evolution of the\nuniverse for much longer time than in the previous work, which showed that the\nSO(9) rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to SO(3) after a\n\"critical time\". We demonstrate how this method works in a simplified model,\nwhich is expected to capture the behaviors of the original model when the space\nis not so large. In particular, we present clear evidence that the\nthree-dimensional space expands exponentially after the critical time in this\nsimplified model.\n", "  Cascade seesaw mechanism generates neutrino mass at higher dimension (5+4n)\noperators through tree level diagram which bring the seesaw scale down to TeV\nand provide collider signatures within LHC reach. In particular, both Type-II\nscalar and Type-III heavy fermion seesaw signatures exist in such a scenario.\nDoubly charged scalar decays into diboson is dominant. We perform a thorough\nstudy on the LHC signals and the Standard Model background. We draw the\nconclusion that multilepton final state from interplay of doubly charged scalar\nand heavy fermion can provide distinguishable signatures from conventional\nseesaw mechanisms.\n", "  Recently, CMS and ATLAS collaborations at LHC announced a Higgs like particle\nwith mass near $125$GeV. Regarding this, to explore its intrinsic properties,\ndifferent observables are needed to be measured precisely at the LHC for\nvarious decay channels of the Higgs. In this context, we calculate the final\nstate lepton polarization asymmetries, namely, single lepton polarization\nasymmetries ($P_i$) and double lepton polarization asymmetries ($P_{ij}$) in\nthe SM for radiative semileptonic Higgs decay $H\\to\\gamma\\tau^+\\tau^-$. In the\nphenomenological analysis of these lepton polarization asymmetries both tree\nand loop level diagrams are considered and it is found that these diagrams give\nimportant contributions in the evaluation of said asymmetries. Interestingly,\nit is found that in $P_{ij}$ the tree level diagrams contribute separately,\nwhich however, are missing in the calculations of $P_i$ and the lepton\nforward-backward asymmetries ($A_{FB}$). Similar to the other observables such\nas the decay rate and the lepton forward-backward asymmetries, the\n$\\tau$-lepton polarization asymmetries would be interesting observables. The\nexperimental study of these observables will provide a fertile ground to\nexplore the intrinsic properties of the SM Higgs boson and its dynamics as well\nas help us to extract the signatures of the possible new physics beyond the SM.\n", "  We present a model of the magnetosphere around an oscillating neutron star.\nThe electromagnetic fields are numerically solved by modeling electric charge\nand current induced by the stellar torsional mode, with particular emphasis on\noutgoing radiation passing through the magnetosphere. The current is modeled\nusing Ohm's law, whereby an increase in conductivity results in an increase in\nthe induced current. As a result, the fields are drastically modified, and\nenergy flux is thereby enhanced. This behavior is however localized in the\nvicinity of the surface since the induced current disappears outwardly in our\nmodel, in which the exterior is assumed to gradually approach a vacuum.\n", "  A search for inelastic scattering of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles\n(WIMPs) on the isotope $^{129}$Xe was done in data taken with the single phase\nliquid xenon detector XMASS at the Kamioka Observatory. Using a restricted\nvolume containing 41 kg of LXe at the very center of our detector we observed\nno significant excess of events in 165.9 days of data. Our background reduction\nallowed us to derive our limits without explicitly subtracting the remaining\nevents which are compatible with background expectations and derive for e.g. a\n50 GeV WIMP an upper limit for its inelastic cross section on $^{129}$Xe nuclei\nof 3.2 pb at the 90% confidence level.\n", "  We consider a situation where the leading-order neutrino mass matrix is\nderived by a theoretical ansatz and reproduces the experimental data well, but\nnot completely. Then, the next stage is to try to fully reproduce the data by\nadding small perturbation terms. In this paper, we obtain the analytical method\nto diagonalize the perturbed mass matrix and find a consistency condition that\nparameters should satisfy not to change \\sin\\theta_{12} much. This condition\ncould cause parameter tuning and plays a crucial role in relating the added\nperturbation terms with the prediction analytically, in particular, for the\ncase of the partially quasi-degenerated neutrino masses (m_2 \\simeq m_1) where\nneutrinoless double beta decays would be observed in the phase-II experiments.\n", "  We analyze the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\\chi$SB) in the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model by using the non-perturbative renormalization\ngroup (NPRG) equation. The equation takes a form of two-dimensional partial\ndifferential equation for the multi-fermion effective interactions $V(x,t)$\nwhere $x$ is $\\bar\\psi\\psi$ operator and $t$ is the logarithm of the\nrenormalization scale. The D$\\chi$SB occurs due to the quantum corrections,\nwhich means it emerges at some finite $t_{\\rm c}$ in the mid of integrating the\nequation with respect to $t$. At $t_{\\rm c}$ some singularities suddenly appear\nin $V$ which is compulsory in the spontaneous symmetry breakdown. Therefore\nthere is no solution of the equation beyond $t_{\\rm c}$. We newly introduce the\nnotion of weak solution to get the global solution including the infrared limit\n$t\\rightarrow \\infty$ and investigate its properties. The obtained weak\nsolution is global and unique, and it perfectly describes the physically\ncorrect vacuum even in case of the first order phase transition appearing in\nfinite density medium. The key logic of deduction is that the weak solution we\ndefined automatically convexifies the effective potential when treating the\nsingularities.\n", "  Local products of fields deformed by the so-called Yang--Mills gradient flow\nbecome renormalized composite operators. This fact has been utilized to\nconstruct a correctly normalized conserved energy--momentum tensor in the\nlattice formulation of the pure Yang--Mills theory. In the present paper, this\nconstruction is further generalized for vector-like gauge theories containing\nfermions.\n", "  The observation of vortices in superconductors was a major breakthrough in\ndeveloping the conceptual background for superconducting applications. Each\nvortex carries a flux quantum, and the magnetic field radially decreases from\nthe center. Techniques used to make magnetic field maps, such as magnetic\ndecoration, give vortex lattice images in a variety of systems. However, strong\ntype II superconductors allow penetration of the magnetic field over large\ndistances, of order of the magnetic penetration depth \\lambda.\nSuperconductivity survives up to magnetic fields where, for imaging purposes,\nthere is nearly no magnetic contrast. Static and dynamic properties of vortices\nare largely unknown at such high magnetic fields. Reciprocal space studies\nusing neutron scattering give insight into the collective behavior. But the\nmicroscopic details of vortex arrangements and their motion remain difficult to\nobtain. Direct real space visualization can be made using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S). Instead of using magnetic contrast, the\nelectronic density of states describes spatial variations of the quasiparticle\nand pair wavefunction properties. These are of order of the superconducting\ncoherence length \\xi, which is much smaller than \\lambda. In principle,\nindividual vortices can be imaged using STM up to the upper critical field\nwhere vortex cores, of size \\xi, overlap. In this review, we describe recent\nadvances in vortex imaging made with scanning tunneling microscopy and\nspectroscopy. We introduce the technique and discuss vortex images which reveal\nthe influence of the Fermi surface distribution of the superconducting gap on\nthe internal structure of vortices, the collective behavior of the lattice in\ndifferent materials and conditions, and the observation of vortex lattice\nmelting.\n", "  We consider the situation in which $m_{3/2}\\sim O(100{\\rm TeV})$ for solving\nthe gravitino problem and the other supersymmetry(SUSY) breaking parameters are\n$O(1{\\rm TeV})$ for the naturalness. We point out that the anomaly mediation\ncancels out the renormalization group contribution to the gaugino masses and\nthe sfermion masses other than the stop masses at a scale which is called the\nmirage scale. The situation is similar to the mirage mediation, in which\nspecial boundary conditions for the SUSY breaking parameters are required,\nthough for the stop masses and the up-type Higgs mass, such cancellation at the\nmirage scale does not happen. Despite no cancellation for the up-type Higgs\nmass, we show that the little hierarchy problem becomes less severe in this\nsituation. One advantage of this situation over the mirage mediation is that\nthe stop mixing parameter $A_t$ can be larger and therefore, smaller stop mass\nis sufficient for 125 GeV Higgs. When the mirage scale is around TeV scale, the\nSUSY breaking parameters induced by the gravity mediation at the grand\nunification scale can be observed directly by the TeV scale experiments.\n", "  Based on the IR-improved bulk holographic AdS/QCD model which provides a\nconsistent prediction for the mass spectra of resonance scalar, pseudoscalar,\nvector and axial vector mesons, we investigate its finite temperature behavior.\nBy analyzing the spectral function of mesons and fitting it with a Breit-Wigner\nform, we perform an analysis for the critical temperature of mesons. The\nback-reaction effects of bulk vacuum are considered, the thermal mass spectral\nfunction of resonance mesons is calculated based on the back-reaction improved\naction. A reasonable melting temperature is found to be $T_c \\simeq 150 \\pm 7$\nMeV, which is consistent with the recent results from lattice QCD simulations.\n", "  Minimizing the energy of an $N$-electron system as a functional of a\ntwo-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM), constrained by necessary\n$N$-representability conditions (conditions for the 2-RDM to represent an\nensemble $N$-electron quantum system), yields a rigorous lower bound to the\nground-state energy in contrast to variational wavefunction methods. We\ncharacterize the performance of two sets of approximate constraints,\n(2,2)-positivity (DQG) and approximate (2,3)-positivity (DQGT) conditions, at\ncapturing correlation in one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional (ladder)\nHubbard models. We find that, while both the DQG and DQGT conditions capture\nboth the weak and strong correlation limits, the more stringent DQGT conditions\nimprove the ground-state energies, the natural occupation numbers, the pair\ncorrelation function, the effective hopping, and the connected (cumulant) part\nof the 2-RDM. We observe that the DQGT conditions are effective at capturing\nstrong electron correlation effects in both one- and quasi-one-dimensional\nlattices for both half filling and less-than-half filling.\n", "  We study the $k$-NN hard core lattice gas model in which the first $k$ next\nnearest neighbor sites of a particle are excluded from occupation by other\nparticles on a two dimensional square lattice. This model is the lattice\nversion of the hard disc system with increasing $k$ corresponding to decreasing\nlattice spacing. While the hard disc system is known to undergo a two step\nfreezing process with increasing density, the lattice model has been known to\nshow only one transition. Here, based on Monte Carlo simulations and high\ndensity expansions of the free energy and density, we argue that for\n$k=4,10,11,14...$, the lattice model undergoes multiple transitions with\nincreasing density. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the same for\n$k=4,\\ldots, 11$. This, in turn, resolves an existing puzzle as to why the 4-NN\nmodel has a continuous transition against the expectation of a first order\ntransition.\n", "  Earlier theory and measurements show that nanomechanical electron shuttles\ncan work as ratchets for radio-frequency rectification, but its performance was\nhard to predict so far. This paper focuses on the coupled shuttles which can\npotentially break symmetry better than a single shuttle. We propose a full\nstochastic model of coupled shuttles, where the mechanical motion of\nnanopillars and the incoherent electronic tunneling are modeled as a Markov\nchain. A linear master equation is constructed. In particular, the interaction\nof the their randomness is taken into account. This model favors analyzing the\nsymmetry breaking that results in the observed rectification\ncurrent~\\cite{Kim2010_PRL}. Further, based on the model we propose the\ndeterministic equations of mean physical variables by assuming multivariate\nGaussian distribution, which enables complex device simulation and design.\n", "  New concept of clustering is discussed in $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei using a\nnew-type microscopic cluster model wave function, which has a structure that\nconstituent clusters are confined in a container, whose size is a variational\nparameter and which we refer to as Hyper-Tohsaki-Horiuchi-Schuck-R\\\"opke\n(Hyper-THSR) wave function. By using the Hyper-THSR wave function, $2\\alpha +\n\\Lambda$ cluster structure in ${^{9}_\\Lambda{\\rm Be}}$ is investigated. We show\nthat full microscopic solutions in the $2\\alpha + \\Lambda$ cluster system,\nwhich are given as $2\\alpha + \\Lambda$ Brink-GCM wave functions, are almost\nperfectly reproduced by the single configurations of the Hyper-THSR wave\nfunction. The squared overlaps between the both wave functions are calculated\nto be $99.5$%, $99.4$%, and $97.7$% for $J^\\pi=0^+$, $2^+$, and $4^+$ states,\nrespectively. We also simulate the structural change by adding the $\\Lambda$\nparticle, by varying the $\\Lambda N$ interaction artificially. As the increase\nof the $\\Lambda N$ interaction, the $\\Lambda$ particle gets to move more deeply\ninside the core and invokes strongly the spatial core shrinkage, and\naccordingly distinct localized $2\\alpha$ clusters appear in the nucleonic\nintrinsic density, though in ${^{8}{\\rm Be}}$ rather gaslike $2\\alpha$-cluster\nstructure is shown. The origin of the localization is associated with the\nstrong effect of Pauli principle. We conclude that the container picture of the\n$2\\alpha$ and $\\Lambda$ clusters is essential in understanding the cluster\nstructure in ${^{9}_\\Lambda{\\rm Be}}$, in which the very compact spatial\nlocalization of clusters is shown in the density distribution.\n", "  Recent LHC experiments have revealed that Higgs is light. As an interesting\ncandidate to accommodate light Higgs, in this paper we adopt the scenario of\ndimensional deconstruction, where Higgs is redarded as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone\nboson. Though the scenario is formulated in ordinary 4-dimensional space-time,\nit may also be interpreted as \"latticized\" gauge-Higgs unification. We point\nout that in this scenario Higgs interaction with matter field is anomalous,\ni.e. its coupling deviates from what the standard model predicts. The interplay\nbetween the periodicity of physical observables in the Higgs field and the\nviolation of translational invariance along the extra-space due to the\nlatticization is argued to play an essential role to get the anomalous\ninteraction. Though the predicted anomalous Higgs interaction has much\nsimilarity to the one in the gauge-Higgs unification, in the case of\ndimensional deconstruction the anomaly exists even if we do not introduce bulk\nmass term for the chiral fermion realized by orbifolding, in clear contrast to\nthe case of gauge-Higgs unification. It in turn means that the anomaly goes\naway in the continuum limit of the extra-space.\n", "  We use gauge/gravity duality to investigate the effect of thermal\nfluctuations on the dissociation of the quarkonium meson in strongly coupled\n$(3+1)$-dimensional gauge theories. This is done by studying the instability\nand probable first order phase transition of a probe D7-brane in the dual\ngravity theory. We explicitly show that for the Minkowski embeddings with their\ntips close to the horizon in the background, the long wavelength thermal\nfluctuations lead to an imaginary term in their action signaling an instability\nin the system. Due to this instability, a phase transition is expected. On the\ngauge theory side, it indicates that the quarkonium mesons are not stable and\ndissociate in the plasma. Identifying the imaginary part of the probe barne\naction with the thermal width of the mesons, we observe that the thermal width\nincreases as one decreases the mass of the quarks. Also keeping the mass fixed,\nthermal width increases by temperature as expected.\n", "  We show the derivation of the self-duality relation of abelian higher-form\ngauge field strength in the topologically nontrivial spacetime background. The\nso-called Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin action for the self-dual abelian gauge field\nassumes that the spacetime topology is trivial to derive the self-duality\nrelation using a gauge transformation of the action. In this paper we find a\nnew gauge transformation of the same theory and show that this new gauge\ntransformation enables us to derive the self-duality relation even in the\ntopologically nontrivial spacetime background.\n", "  In 1994, Kac and Wakimoto suggested a generalization of Bernstein and Leites\ncharacter formula for basic Lie superalgebras, and the natural question was\nraised: to which simple highest weight modules does it apply? In this paper, we\nprove a similar formula for a large class of finite-dimensional simple modules\nover the Lie superalgebra gl(m|n), which we call piecewise disconnected\nmodules, or PDC. The class of PDC modules naturally includes totally connected\nmodules and totally disconnected modules, the two families for which similiar\ncharacter formulas were proven by Su and Zhang as special cases of their\ngeneral formula. This paper is part of our program for the pursuit of elegant\ncharacter formulas for Lie superalgebras.\n", "  We continue to investigate possible parameter choices for primordial\ninflation with simple potentials such as power-law and two-term potentials. We\nexamine the amount of parameter tuning to make the slow-roll inflation eternal.\nIn particular, we adopt the critical coupling for marginally eternal inflation\nand see whether realistic primordial inflation is attainable under such a\nparameter choice. It turns out that potentials with mass scale of grand\nunification provide, after tuning, consistent results to experimental data so\nthat the considered tuning is allowed observationally. Namely, the primordial\ninflation is possibly marginal in such a setup.\n", "  In [FL1, FL3] we found mathematical interpretations of the one-loop conformal\nfour-point Feynman integral as well as the vacuum polarization Feynman integral\nin the context of representations of a Lie group U(2,2) and quaternionic\nanalysis. Then we raised a natural question of finding mathematical\ninterpretation of other Feynman diagrams in the same setting. In this article\nwe describe this interpretation for all conformal four-point integrals. Using\nthis interpretation, we give a representation-theoretic proof of an operator\nversion of the \"magic identities\" for the conformal four-point integrals\ndescribed by the box diagrams.\n  The original \"magic identities\" are due to J.M.Drummond, J.Henn, V.A.Smirnov\nand E.Sokatchev, they assert that all n-loop box integrals for four scalar\nmassless particles are equal to each other [DHSS]. The authors give a proof of\nthe magic identities for the Euclidean metric case only and claim that the\nresult is also true for the Minkowski metric case. However, the Minkowski case\nis much more subtle. In this article we prove an operator version of the magic\nidentities in the Minkowski metric case and, in particular, specify the\nrelative positions of cycles of integration that make these identities correct.\n  No prior knowledge of physics or Feynman diagrams is assumed from the reader.\nWe provide a summary of all relevant results from quaternionic analysis to make\nthe article self-contained.\n", "  Ongoing fascination with quantum mechanics keeps driving the development of\nthe wide field of quantum-optics, including its neutron-optics branch.\nApplication of neutron-optical methods and, especially, neutron interferometry\nand polarimetry has a long-standing tradition for experimental investigations\nof fundamental quantum phenomena. We give an overview of related experimental\nefforts made in recent years.\n", "  Topological and kinematical characteristics of hadron interactions have been\nstudied using a lead-emulsion target exposed to 2, 4 and 10 GeV/c hadron beams.\nA total length of 60 m $\\pi^-$ tracks was followed using a high speed automated\nemulsion scanning system. A total of 318 hadron interaction vertices and their\nsecondary charged particle tracks were reconstructed. Measurement results of\ninteraction lengths, charged particle multiplicity, emission angles and momenta\nof secondary charged particles are compared with a Monte Carlo simulation and\nappear to be consistent. Nuclear fragments emitted from interaction vertices\nwere also detected by a newly developed emulsion scanning system with\nwide-angle acceptance. Their emission angle distributions are in good agreement\nwith the simulated distributions. Probabilities of an event being associated\nwith at least one fragment track are found to be greater than 50% for beam\nmomentum $P > 4$ GeV/c and are well reproduced by the simulation. These\nexperimental results validate estimation of the background due to hadron\ninteractions in the sample of $\\tau$ decay candidates in the OPERA $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillation experiment.\n", "  We consider a gapped periodic quantum system with time-reversal symmetry of\nfermionic (or odd) type, i.e. the time-reversal operator squares to -1. We\ninvestigate the existence of periodic and time-reversal invariant Bloch frames\nin dimensions 2 and 3. In 2d, the obstruction to the existence of such a frame\nis shown to be encoded in a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued topological invariant, which\ncan be computed by a simple algorithm. We prove that the latter agrees with the\nFu-Kane index. In 3d, instead, four $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants emerge from the\nconstruction, again related to the Fu-Kane-Mele indices. When no topological\nobstruction is present, we provide a constructive algorithm yielding explicitly\na periodic and time-reversal invariant Bloch frame. The result is formulated in\nan abstract setting, so that it applies both to discrete models and to\ncontinuous ones.\n", "  We investigate the late-time asymptotics of future expanding, polarized\nvacuum Einstein spacetimes with T2-symmetry on T3, which, by definition, admit\ntwo spacelike Killing fields. Our main result is the existence of a stable\nasymptotic regime within this class, that is, we provide here a full\ndescription of the late-time asymptotics of the solutions to the Einstein\nequations when the initial data set is close to the asymptotic regime. Our\nproof is based on several energy functionals with lower order corrections (as\nis standard for such problems) and the derivation of a simplified model which\nwe exhibit here. Roughly speaking, the Einstein equations in the symmetry class\nunder consideration consists of a system of wave equations coupled to\nconstraint equations plus a system of ordinary differential equations. The\nunknowns involved in the system of ordinary equations are blowing up in the\nfuture timelike directions. One of our main contributions is the derivation of\nnovel effective equations for suitably renormalized unknowns. Interestingly,\nthis renormalization is not performed with respect to a fixed background, but\ndoes involve the energy of the coupled system of wave equations. In addition,\nwe construct an open set of initial data which are arbitrarily close to the\nexpected asymptotic behavior. We emphasize that, in comparison, the class of\nGowdy spacetimes exhibits a very different dynamical behavior to the one we\nuncover in the present work for general polarized T2-symmetric spacetimes.\nFurthermore, all the conclusions of this paper are valid within the framework\nof weakly T2-symmetric spacetimes previously introduced by the authors.\n", "  We analyze an elastic surface energy which was recently introduced by G.\nNapoli and L.Vergori to model thin films of nematic liquid crystals. We show\nhow a novel approach that takes into account also the extrinsic properties of\nthe surfaces coated by the liquid crystal leads to considerable differences\nwith respect to the classical intrinsic energy. Our results concern three\nconnected aspects: i) using methods of the calculus of variations, we establish\na relation between the existence of minimizers and the topology of the surface;\nii) we prove, by a Ginzburg-Landau approximation, the well-posedness of the\ngradient flow of the energy; iii) in the case of a parametrized axisymmetric\ntorus we obtain a stronger characterization of global and local minimizers,\nwhich we supplement with numerical experiments.\n", "  Gravity mediation supersymmetry breaking become comparable to gauge mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking contributions when messenger masses are close to the GUT\nscale. By suitably tuning the gravity contributions one can then modify the\nsoft supersymmetry breaking sector to generate a large stop mixing parameter\nand a light higgs mass of 125 GeV. In this kind of hybrid models, however the\nnice features of gauge mediation like flavour conservation etc, are lost. To\npreserve the nice features, gravitational contributions should become important\nfor lighter messenger masses and should be important only for certain fields.\nThis is possible when the hidden sector contains multiple (at least two)\nspurions with hierarchical vaccum expectation values. In this case, the\ngravitational contribtutions can be organised to be `just right'. We present a\ncomplete model with two spurion hidden sector where the gravitational\ncontribution is from a warped flavour model in a Randall-Sundrum setting. Along\nthe way, we present simple expressions to handle renormalisation group\nequations when supersymmetry is broken by two different sectors at two\ndifferent scales.\n", "  We consider a modified KBc algebra in bosonic open string field theory\nexpanded around identity-based scalar solutions. By use of the algebra,\nclassical solutions on the background are constructed and observables for them,\nincluding energy densities and gauge invariant overlaps, are calculable. These\nresults are applied to evaluate observables analytically for both of the\nidentity-based trivial pure gauge solution and the identity-based tachyon\nvacuum solution.\n", "  The signals in dark matter direct-detection experiments should exhibit\nmodulation signatures due to the Earth's motion with respect to the Galactic\ndark matter halo. The annual and daily modulations, due to the Earth's\nrevolution about the Sun and rotation about its own axis, have been explored\npreviously. Monthly modulation is another such feature present in direct\ndetection signals, and provides a nearly model-independent method of\ndistinguishing dark matter signal events from background. We study here monthly\nmodulations in detail for both WIMP and WISP dark matter searches, examining\nboth the effect of the motion of the Earth about the Earth-Moon barycenter and\nthe gravitational focusing due to the Moon. For WIMP searches, we calculate the\nmonthly modulation of the count rate and show the effects are too small to be\nobserved in the foreseeable future. For WISP dark matter experiments, we show\nthat the photons generated by WISP to photon conversion have frequencies which\nundergo a monthly modulating shift which is detectable with current technology\nand which cannot in general be neglected in high resolution WISP searches.\n", "  The subtraction method for the matching between the matrix element (ME) and\nparton shower (PS), that has been developed for combining 0-jet and 1-jet\nproduction processes in association with electroweak-boson production in hadron\ncollisions, is extended to multi-jet production. In order to include multi-jet\nMEs, we have to address the soft-gluon divergence together with the collinear\ndivergence. We introduce an approximation which simultaneously reproduces both\ndivergences in a form suitable for application to our subtraction method. The\nalteration in the subtraction can be compensated by applying an appropriate\ncorrection to corresponding non-radiative events. We demonstrate that $W$ + 0,\n1, and 2 jet production processes can be consistently combined using the\ndeveloped matching method.\n", "  Theoretical studies on the experimental feasibility of hypothetical Zeolitic\nImidazolate Frameworks (ZIF) have focused so far on relative energy of various\npolymorphs, by energy minimization at the quantum chemical level. We present\nhere a systematic study of stability of 18 ZIFs as a function of temperature\nand pressure, by molecular dynamics simulations. This approach allows us to\nbetter understand the limited stability of some experimental structures upon\nsolvent or guest removal. We also find that many of the hypothetical ZIFs\nproposed in the literature are not stable at room temperature. Mechanical and\nthermal stability criteria thus need to be considered for the prediction of new\nMOF structures. Finally, we predict a variety of thermal expansion behavior for\nZIFs as a function of framework topology, with some materials showing large\nnegative volume thermal expansion.\n", "  We propose the natural inflation from the heterotic string theory on\n\"Swiss-Cheese\" Calabi-Yau manifold with multiple $U(1)$ magnetic fluxes. Such\nmultiple $U(1)$ magnetic fluxes stabilize the same number of the linear\ncombination of the universal axion and K\\\"ahler axions and one of the K\\\"ahler\naxions is identified as the inflaton. This axion decay constant can be\ndetermined by the size of one-loop corrections to the gauge kinetic function of\nthe hidden gauge groups, which leads effectively to the trans-Planckian axion\ndecay constant consistent with the WMAP, Planck and/or BICEP2 data. During the\ninflation, the real parts of the moduli are also stabilized by employing the\nnature of the \"Swiss-Cheese\" Calabi-Yau manifold.\n", "  We study the effects of non-standard interactions on the oscillation pattern\nof atmospheric neutrinos. We use neutrino oscillograms as our main tool to\ninfer the role of non-standard interactions (NSI) parameters at the probability\nlevel in the energy range, $E \\in [1,20]$ GeV and zenith angle range, $\\cos\n\\theta \\in [-1,0]$. We compute the event rates for atmospheric neutrino events\nin presence of NSI parameters in the energy range $E \\in [1,10]$ GeV for two\ndifferent detector configurations - a magnetized iron calorimeter and an\nunmagnetized liquid Argon time projection chamber which have different\nsensitivities to NSI parameters due to their complementary characteristics. As\nan application, we discuss how NSI parameter, $\\epsilon_{\\mu\\tau}$ impacts the\ndetermination of the correct octant of $\\theta_{23}$.\n", "  The ionizing background of cosmic hydrogen is an important probe of the\nsources and absorbers of ionizing radiation in the post-reionization universe.\nPrevious studies show that the ionization rate should be very sensitive to\nchanges in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink in\nsize, increasing the ionizing mean free path and, hence, the ionizing\nbackground. By contrast, observations of the ionizing background find a very\nflat evolution from z~2-5, before falling precipitously at z~6. We resolve this\npuzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~2-5, optically thick absorbers\nare associated with the same collapsed halos that host ionizing sources. Thus,\nan increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding\nincrease in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the\nionizing background. However, by z~5-6, gas outside of halos dominates the\nabsorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and the\nionizing background evolves rapidly. Our halo based model reproduces\nobservations of the ionizing background, its flatness and sudden decline, as\nwell as the redshift evolution of the ionizing mean free path. Our work\nsuggests that, through much of their history, both star formation and\nphotoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.\n", "  There is an avatar of the little hierarchy problem of the MSSM in\n3-dimensional supersymmetry. We propose a solution to this problem in AdS$_3$\nbased on the AdS/CFT correspondence. The bulk theory is a supergravity theory\nin which U(1) $\\times$ U(1) R-symmetry is gauged by Chern-Simons fields. The\nbulk theory is deformed by a boundary term quadratic in the gauge fields. It\nbreaks SUSY completely and sources an exactly marginal operator in the dual\nCFT. SUSY breaking is communicated by gauge interactions to bulk scalar fields\nand their spinor superpartners. Since the R-charges of scalar and spinor\ndiffer, this generates a SUSY breaking shift of their masses. The Ward identity\nfacilitates the calculation of these mass shifts to any desired order in the\nstrength of the deformation. Moduli fields are massless $R$-neutral bulk\nscalars with vanishing potential in the undeformed theory. These properties are\nmaintained to all orders in the deformation despite the fact that moduli couple\nin the bulk to loops of R-charged fields.\n", "  It is difficult to find or identifying the binary black holes in parsec\nscales, since the dual AGN may be merged quickly. It is required to explore\nmore possibilities to identifying binary black holes in parsec scales, we give\nsome discussions, especially with the VLBI methods.\n", "  By evaluating the upper and thermodynamic critical fields, $H_{c2}$ and\n$H_c$, and their ratio $H_{c2}/H_c $ at arbitrary temperatures, we argue that\nsituations are possible when a type-II material is transformed to type-I by\nadding magnetic impurities.\n", "  We investigate in vitro fibrillation kinetics of the hormone peptide glucagon\nat various concentrations using confocal microscopy and determine the glucagon\nfibril persistence length $60 \\mu\\textrm{m}$. At all concentrations we observe\nthat periods of individual fibril growth are interrupted by periods of stasis.\nThe growth probability is large at high and low concentrations and is reduced\nfor intermediate glucagon concentrations. To explain this behavior we propose a\nsimple model, where fibrils come in two forms, one built entirely from glucagon\nmonomers and one entirely from glucagon trimers. The opposite building blocks\nact as fibril growth blockers, and this generic model reproduces experimental\nbehavior well.\n", "  We report high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nmeasurements on the honeycomb iridate Na2IrO3. Our measurements reveal the\nexistence of a metallic surface band feature crossing the Fermi level with\nnearly linear dispersion and an estimated surface carrier density of 3.2\n$\\times$ 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, which has not been theoretically predicted or\nexperimentally observed, and provides the first evidence for metallic behavior\non the boundary of this material, whereas the bulk bands exhibit a robust\ninsulating gap. We further show the lack of theoretically predicted Dirac cones\nat the $\\overline{M}$ points of the surface Brillouin zone, which confirms the\nabsence of a stacked quantum spin Hall phase in this material. Our data\nindicates that the surface ground state of this material is exotic and\nmetallic, unlike as predicted in theory, and establishes Na2IrO3 as a rare\nexample of a strongly correlated spin-orbit insulator with surface metallicity.\n", "  Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for a measure to be the\nspectral measure of a finite range perturbation of a Jacobi or CMV operator\nfrom a finite gap isospectral torus. The special case of eventually periodic\noperators solves an open problem of Simon [25, D.2.7].\n  We also solve the inverse resonance problem: it is shown that an operator is\ncompletely determined by the set of its eigenvalues and resonances, and we\nprovide necessary and sufficient conditions on their configuration for such an\noperator to exist.\n", "  We investigate effects of triple-$\\alpha$ and $^{12}\\rm C(\\alpha,\\gamma)\n^{16}O$ reaction rates on the production of supernova yields for a massive star\nof 25 $M_{\\odot}$. We combine the reaction rates to examine the rate\ndependence, where the rates are considered to cover the possible variation of\nthe rates based on experiments on the earth and theories. We adopt four\ncombinations of the reaction rates from two triple-$\\alpha$ reaction rates and\ntwo $^{12}\\rm C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}O$ ones. First, we examine the evolution of\nmassive stars of 20 and 25 $M_{\\odot}$ whose helium cores correspond to helium\nstars of 6 and 8 $M_{\\odot}$, respectively. While the 25 $M_{\\odot}$ stars\nevolve to the presupernova stages for all combinations of the reaction rates,\nevolutionary paths of the 20 $M_{\\odot}$ stars proceed significantly different\nway for some combinations, which are unacceptable for progenitors of\nsupernovae. Second, we perform calculations of supernova explosions within the\nlimitation of spherical symmetry and compare the calculated abundance ratios\nwith the solar system abundances. We can deduce some constraints to the\nreaction rates. As the results, a conventional rate is adequate for a\ntriple-$\\alpha$ reaction rate and a rather higher value of the reaction rate\nwithin the upper limit for the experimental uncertainties is favorable for a\n$^{12}\\rm C(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}O$ rate.\n", "  Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum theory as well as a key\nresource for quantum computing and quantum communication, but the entanglement\nmechanism has not been found at present. We think when the two subsystems exist\ninteraction directly or indirectly, they can be in entanglement state. such as,\nin the Jaynes-Cummings model, the entanglement between an atom and light field\ncomes from their interaction. In this paper, we have studied the entanglement\nmechanism of electron-electron and photon-photon, which are from the spin-spin\ninteraction. We found their total entanglement states are relevant both space\nstate and spin state. When two electrons or two photons are far away, their\nentanglement states should be disappeared even if their spin state is\nentangled.\n", "  The spin up-down splitting of collective flows in intermediate-energy\nheavy-ion collisions as a result of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction is\ninvestigated within a spin- and isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehing-Uhlenbeck\ntransport model SIBUU12. Using a Skyrme-type spin-orbit coupling quadratic in\nmomentum, we found that the spin splittings of the directed flow and elliptic\nflow are largest in peripheral Au+Au collisions at beam energies of about\n100-200 MeV/nucleon, and the effect is considerable even in smaller systems\nespecially for nucleons with high transverse momenta. The collective flows of\nlight clusters of different spin states are also investigated using an improved\ndynamical coalescence model with spin. Our study can be important in\nunderstanding the properties of in-medium nuclear spin-orbit interactions once\nthe spin-dependent observables proposed in this work can be measured.\n", "  By Maxwell equal area law we study the phase transition in higher dimensional\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m (RN) black hole and Kerr black hole\nin this paper. The coexisting region of the two phases involved in the phase\ntransition is found and the coexisting curves are shown in $P-T$ figures. We\nalso analytically investigate the parameters which affect the coexisting\ncurves. To better compare with ordinary thermodynamic systems, the Clapeyon\nequation is derived for higher dimensional AdS black holes. This paper can help\nto deepen the understanding of the phase transition and phase structure of AdS\nblack holes.\n", "  Pulsations were recently detected from the ultraluminous X-ray source X-2 in\nM82. The newly discovered pulsar has been described as a common neutron star\nwith a 1 TG magnetic field that accretes above the Eddington rate and as a\nmagnetar-like pulsar with a 100 TG magnetic field that is above the quantum\nlimit. We show here that this X-ray source is not exotic in any sense. The\nstandard equations of accretion along field lines predict that, for the\nmeasured spin period $P_S$ and spinup rate $\\dot{P_S}$, the isotropic X-ray\nluminosity $L_X$ must be near the Eddington limit (i.e., $L_{X}\\approx\n3.5\\times 10^{38}$~erg~s$^{-1}$); and that the surface magnetic field $B$, that\ndoes not depend on $P_S$, must be modest (i.e., $B_*\\approx 1-10$ TG). The\nobserved higher luminosity can be explained by a moderate amount of geometric\nbeaming that occurs in our direction. Other ultraluminous X-ray sources may\nalso turn out to be common pulsars with similar physical characteristics, but\nsince the emission must occur at a favorable angle to the observer, we expect\nthat very few such pulsars will be discovered in the future.\n", "  This study uses very simple symmetry and consistency considerations to put\nconstraints on possible Friedmann equations for modified gravity models in\ncurved spaces. As an example, it is applied to loop quantum cosmology.\n", "  Precision sensing, and in particular high precision magnetometry, is a\ncentral goal of research into quantum technologies. For magnetometers, often\ntrade-offs exist between sensitivity, spatial resolution, and frequency range.\nThe precision, and thus the sensitivity of magnetometry, scales as $1/\\sqrt\n{T_2}$ with the phase coherence time, $T_2$, of the sensing system playing the\nrole of a key determinant. Adapting a dynamical decoupling scheme that allows\nfor extending $T_2$ by orders of magnitude and merging it with a magnetic\nsensing protocol, we achieve a measurement sensitivity even for high frequency\nfields close to the standard quantum limit. Using a single atomic ion as a\nsensor, we experimentally attain a sensitivity of $4.6$ pT $/\\sqrt{Hz}$ for an\nalternating-current magnetic field near 14 MHz. Based on the principle\ndemonstrated here, this unprecedented sensitivity combined with spatial\nresolution in the nanometer range and tunability from direct-current to the\ngigahertz range could be used for magnetic imaging in as of yet inaccessible\nparameter regimes.\n", "  The Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) neutrino experiment measures neutrino oscillations\nby using an almost pure muon neutrino beam produced at the J-PARC accelerator\nfacility. The T2K muon monitor was installed to measure the direction and\nstability of the muon beam which is produced together with the muon neutrino\nbeam. The systematic error in the muon beam direction measurement was\nestimated, using data and MC simulation, to be 0.28 mrad. During beam\noperation, the proton beam has been controlled using measurements from the muon\nmonitor and the direction of the neutrino beam has been tuned to within 0.3\nmrad with respect to the designed beam-axis. In order to understand the muon\nbeam properties,measurement of the absolute muon yield at the muon monitor was\nconducted with an emulsion detector. The number of muon tracks was measured to\nbe $(4.06\\pm0.05)\\times10^4$ cm$^{-2}$ normalized with $4\\times10^{11}$ protons\non target with 250 kA horn operation. The result is in agreement with the\nprediction which is corrected based on hadron production data.\n", "  All living things exhibit adaptations that enable them to survive and\nreproduce in the natural environment that they inhabit. From a biological\nstandpoint, it has long been understood that adaptation comes from natural\nselection, whereby maladapted individuals do not pass their traits effectively\nto future generations. However, we may also consider the phenomenon of\nadaptation from the standpoint of physics, and ask whether it is possible to\ndelineate what the difference is in terms of physical properties between\nsomething that is well-adapted to its surrounding environment, and something\nthat is not. In this work, we undertake to address this question from a\ntheoretical standpoint. Building on past fundamental results in\nfar-from-equilibrium statistical mechanics, we demonstrate a generalization of\nthe Helmholtz free energy for the finite-time stochastic evolution of driven\nNewtonian matter. By analyzing this expression term by term, we are able to\nargue for a general tendency in driven many-particle systems towards\nself-organization into states formed through exceptionally reliable absorption\nand dissipation of work energy from the surrounding environment. Subsequently,\nwe illustrate the mechanism of this general tendency towards physical\nadaptation by analyzing the process of random hopping in driven energy\nlandscapes.\n", "  There has been a proposal that infrared quantum effects of massless\ninteracting field theories in de-Sitter space may provide time-dependent\nscreening of the cosmological constant. As a concrete model of the proposal, we\nstudy the three loop corrections to the energy-momentum tensor of massless\n$\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory in the background of classical Liouville gravity in\n$D=2$ dimensional de-Sitter space. We find that the cosmological constant is\nscreened in sharp contrast to the massless $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory in $D=4$\ndimensions due to the sign difference between the cosmological constant of the\nLiouville gravity and that of the Einstein gravity. To argue for the robustness\nof our prediction, we introduce the concept of time-dependent infrared\ncounter-terms and examine if they recover the de-Sitter invariance in the\n$\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory in comparison with the Sine-Gordon model where it was\npossible.\n", "  We examine the symmetries of the action suppelemented by the constraint in\nthe WZW-type open superstring field theory. It is found that this pseudo-action\nhas additional symmetries provided we impose the constraint after the\ntransformation. Respecting these additional symmetries, we propose a\nprescription for the new Feynman rules for the Ramond sector. It is shown that\nthe new rules reproduce the well-known on-shell four- and five-point amplitudes\nwith external fermions.\n", "  The chiral magnetic effect is the generation of electric current induced by\nchirality imbalance in the presence of magnetic field. It is a macroscopic\nmanifestation of the quantum anomaly in relativistic field theory of chiral\nfermions (massless spin $1/2$ particles with a definite projection of spin on\nmomentum) -- a dramatic phenomenon arising from a collective motion of\nparticles and antiparticles in the Dirac sea. The recent discovery of Dirac\nsemimetals with chiral quasi-particles opens a fascinating possibility to study\nthis phenomenon in condensed matter experiments. Here we report on the first\nobservation of chiral magnetic effect through the measurement of\nmagneto-transport in zirconium pentatelluride, ZrTe_5. Our angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy experiments show that this material's electronic\nstructure is consistent with a 3D Dirac semimetal. We observe a large negative\nmagnetoresistance when magnetic field is parallel with the current. The\nmeasured quadratic field dependence of the magnetoconductance is a clear\nindication of the chiral magnetic effect. The observed phenomenon stems from\nthe effective transmutation of Dirac semimetal into a Weyl semimetal induced by\nthe parallel electric and magnetic fields that represent a topologically\nnontrivial gauge field background.\n", "  We describe a novel photon detector which operates under an intense flux of\nneutrons. It is composed of lead-aerogel sandwich counter modules. Its salient\nfeatures are high photon detection efficiency and blindness to neutrons. As a\nresult of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, the efficiency for photons with the\nenergy larger than 1 GeV is expected to be higher than 99.5% and that for 2\nGeV/$c$ neutrons less than 1%. The performance on the photon detection under\nsuch a large flux of neutrons was measured for a part of the detector. It was\nconfirmed that the efficiency to photons with the energy $>$1 GeV was\nconsistent with the MC expectation within 8.2% uncertainty.\n", "  Rules, regulations, and policies are the basis of civilized society and are\nused to coordinate the activities of individuals who have a variety of goals\nand purposes. History has taught that over-regulation (too many rules) makes it\ndifficult to compete and under-regulation (too few rules) can lead to crisis.\nThis implies an optimal number of rules that avoids these two extremes. Rules\ncreate boundaries that define the latitude an individual has to perform their\nactivities. This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines\nit with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the\nlatitude provided to an insider threat. Simulations with the Toy Model\nillustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated,\npossibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up\nthe number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal\nindividual to carry out their activities. The Toy Model is then mapped onto the\nstandard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is\nobserved. This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more\ncomplex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community\nand also show the same behavior. Finally, by estimating N and Lmin it should be\npossible to determine the regime of any particular environment.\n", "  We investigate the process of circularly polarized high harmonic generation\nin molecules using a bicircular laser field. In this context, we show that\nmolecules offer a very robust framework for the production of circularly\npolarized harmonics, provided their symmetry is compatible with that of the\nlaser field. Using a discrete time-dependent symmetry analysis, we show how all\nthe features (harmonic order and polarization) of spectra can be explained and\npredicted. The symmetry analysis is generic and can easily be applied to other\ntarget and/or field configurations.\n", "  We consider random non-normal matrices constructed by removing one row and\ncolumn from samples from Dyson's circular ensembles or samples from the\nclassical compact groups. We develop sparse matrix models whose spectral\nmeasures match these ensembles. This allows us to compute the joint law of the\neigenvalues, which have a natural interpretation as resonances for open quantum\nsystems or as electrostatic charges located in a dielectric medium.\n  Our methods allow us to consider all values of $\\beta>0$, not merely\n$\\beta=1,2,4$.\n", "  We clarify the conditions or assumptions under which theoretical predictions\nof various models beyond the standard model give mainly in electric dipole\nmoments. The correct interpretation of those conditions seems to be\nindispensable to the refinements of model building as well as to the mutual\nreliance in experimental and theoritical communities. The connections of these\nanalyses to the recent experimental results at the LHC and the other places are\nalso discussed.\n", "  A scheme of quantum electrodynamic (QED) background-free radiative emission\nof neutrino pair (RENP) is proposed in order to achieve precision determination\nof neutrino properties so far not accessible. The important point for the\nbackground rejection is the fact that the dispersion relation between wave\nvector along propagating direction in wave guide (and in a photonic-crystal\ntype fiber) and frequency is modified by a discretized non-vanishing effective\nmass. This effective mass acts as a cutoff of allowed frequencies, and one may\nselect the RENP photon energy region free of all macro-coherently amplified QED\nprocesses by choosing the cutoff larger than the mass of neutrinos.\n", "  I investigate quantum decoherence in a one-body density matrix of a composite\nparticle consisting of two correlated particles. Because of a two-body\ncorrelation in the composite particle, quantum decoherence occurs in the\none-body density matrix that has been reduced from the two-body density matrix.\nAs the delocalization of the distribution of the composite particle grows, the\nentanglement entropy increases, and the system can be well-described by a\nsemi-classical approximation, wherein the center position of the composite\nparticle can be regarded as a classical coordinate. I connect the quantum\ndecoherence in the one-body density matrix of a composite particle to the\ncoarse graining in a phase space distribution function of a single particle and\nassociate it with the Husimi function.\n", "  We introduce a critical-state model incorporating the anisotropy of flux-line\npinning to analyze the critical states developing in an anisotropic biaxial\nsuperconducting slab exposed to a uniform perpendicular magnetic field and to\ntwo crossed in-plane magnetic fields which are applied successively. The theory\nis an extension of the anisotropic collective pinning theory developed by\nMikitik and Brandt. The anisotropic flux-line pinning enters into the critical\nstates by generating the angular dependence of the critical current density and\nby deviating the direction of the electric field from the current in the plane\nperpendicular to the vortex line. We find that an enhanced in-plane anisotropy\nmoderates the gradients of the magnitudes of the magnetic field and the\nelectric field along the slab thickness, however increases the gradients of\ntheir rotations.\n", "  We discuss the use of a class of exact finite energy solutions to the vacuum\nsource-free Maxwell equations as models for multi- and single cycle laser\npulses in classical interaction with relativistic charged point particles.\nThese compact solutions are classified in terms of their chiral content and\ntheir influence on particular charge configurations in space. The results of\nsuch classical interactions motivate a phenomenological quantum description of\na propagating laser pulse in a medium in terms of an effective quantum\nHamiltonian.\n", "  The disk instability picture gives a plausible explanation for the behavior\nof soft X-ray transient systems if self-irradiation of the disk is included. We\nshow that there is a simple relation between the peak luminosity (at the start\nof an outburst) and the decay timescale. We use this relation to place\nconstraints on systems assumed to undergo disk instabilities. The observable\nX-ray populations of elliptical galaxies must largely consist of long-lived\ntransients, as deduced on different grounds by Piro and Bildsten (2002). The\nstrongly-varying X-ray source HLX-1 in the galaxy ESO 243-49 can be modeled as\na disk instability of a highly super-Eddington stellar-mass binary similar to\nSS433. A fit to the disk instability picture is not possible for an\nintermediate-mass black hole model for HLX-1. Other, recently identified,\nsuper-Eddington ULXs might be subject to disk instability.\n", "  In the complex action theory whose path runs over not only past but also\nfuture we study a normalized matrix element of an operator $\\hat{\\cal O}$\ndefined in terms of the future state at the latest time $T_B$ and the past\nstate at the earliest time $T_A$ with a proper inner product that makes normal\na given Hamiltonian that is non-normal at first. We present a theorem that\nstates that, provided that the operator $\\hat{\\cal O}$ is $Q$-Hermitian, i.e.,\nHermitian with regard to the proper inner product, the normalized matrix\nelement becomes real and time-develops under a $Q$-Hermitian Hamiltonian for\nthe past and future states selected such that the absolute value of the\ntransition amplitude from the past state to the future state is maximized.\nFurthermore, we give a possible procedure to formulate the $Q$-Hermitian\nHamiltonian in terms of $Q$-Hermitian coordinate and momentum operators, and\nconstruct a conserved probability current density.\n", "  We study Q-ball dark matter in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, and\nseek the possibility of detection in the IceCube experiment. We find that the Q\nballs would be the dark matter in the parameter region different from that for\ngravitino dark matter. In particular, the Q ball is a good dark matter\ncandidate for low reheating temperature, which may be suitable for the\nAffleck-Dine baryogenesis and/or nonthermal leptogenesis. Dark matter Q balls\nare detectable by IceCube-like experiments in the future, which is the peculiar\nfeature compared to the case of gravitino dark matter.\n", "  In the zero temperature Brownian semi-discrete directed polymer we study the\njoint distribution of two last-passage times at positions ordered in the\ntime-like direction. This is the situation when we have the slow de-correlation\nphenomenon. We compute the limiting joint distribution function in a scaling\nlimit. This limiting distribution is given by an expansion in determinants\nwhich is not a Fredholm expansion. A somewhat similar looking formula was\nderived non-rigorously in a related model by Dotsenko.\n", "  We review the skill of thirty coupled climate models participating in Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project 5 in terms of reproducing properties of the\nseasonal cycle of precipitation over the major river basins of South and\nSoutheast Asia (Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong) for historical period\n(1961-2000). We also present projected changes by these models by end of\ncentury (2061-2100) under extreme scenario RCP8.5. First, we assess their\nability to reproduce observed timings of the monsoon onset and the rate of\nrapid fractional accumulation (RFA slope) - a measure of seasonality within\nactive monsoon period. Secondly, we apply a threshold-independent seasonality\nindex (SI) - a multiplicative measure of precipitation and extent of its\nconcentration relative to the uniform distribution (relative entropy - RE). We\napply SI distinctly for monsoonal precipitation regime (MPR), westerly\nprecipitation regime (WPR) and annual precipitation regime. For present\nclimate, neither any single model nor the multi-model mean performs best in all\nchosen metrics. Models show overall a modest skill in suggesting right timings\nof the monsoon onset while the RFA slope is generally underestimated. One third\nof models fail to capture the monsoon signal over the Indus basin. Mostly, SI\nestimates for WPR are simulated higher than observed for all basins, while for\nMPR, it is simulated higher (lower) for Ganges and Brahmaputra (Indus and\nMekong) basins, following the pattern of overestimation (underestimation) of\nprecipitation. However, models are biased positive (negative) for RE estimates\nover Indus and Ganges (Brahmaputra and Mekong) basins, implying the extent of\nprecipitation concentration for MPR and number of dry days within WPR higher\n(lower) than observed for these basins. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, most of\nmodels project a slightly delayed monsoon onset, and a general increase in the\nRFA slope...\n", "  In the present paper we study the thermodynamical properties of finitely\ngenerated continuous subgroup actions. We address a notion of topological\nentropy and pressure functions that does not depend on the growth rate of the\nsemigroup and introduce strong and orbital specification properties, under\nwhich, the semigroup actions have positive topological entropy and all points\nare entropy points. Moreover, we study the convergence and Lipschitz regularity\nof the pressure function and obtain relations between topological entropy and\nexponential growth rate of periodic points in the context of semigroups of\nexpanding maps. The specification properties for semigroup actions and the\ncorresponding one for its generators and the action of push-forward maps is\nalso discussed.\n", "  Topological quantum systems subjected to an even (resp. odd) time-reversal\nsymmetry can be classified by looking at the related \"Real\" (resp.\n\"Quaternionic\") Bloch-bundles. If from one side the topological classification\nof these time-reversal vector bundle theories has been completely described in\n[DG1] for the \"Real\" case and in [DG2] for the \"Quaternionic\" case, from the\nother side it seems that a classification in terms of differential geometric\ninvariants is still missing in the literature. With this article (and its\ncompanion [DG3]) we want to cover this gap. More precisely, we extend in an\nequivariant way the theory of connections on principal bundles and vector\nbundles endowed with a time-reversal symmetry. In the \"Real\" case we generalize\nthe Chern-Weil theory and we showed that the assignment of a \"Real\" connection,\nalong with the related differential Chern class and its holonomy, suffices for\nthe classification of \"Real\" vector bundles in low dimensions.\n", "  By employing the gradient/Wilson flow, we derive a universal formula that\nexpresses a correctly normalized flavor non-singlet axial-vector current of\nquarks. The formula is universal in the sense that it holds independently of\nregularization and especially holds with lattice regularization. It is also\nconfirmed that, in the lowest non-trivial order of perturbation theory, the\ntriangle diagram containing the formula and two flavor non-singlet vector\ncurrents possesses non-local structure that is compatible with the triangle\nanomaly.\n", "  A new inner product is constructed on each standard module over the\nTemperley-Lieb algebra $\\mathsf{TL}_n(\\beta)$ for $\\beta\\in \\mathbb R$ and $n\n\\ge 2$. On these modules, the Hamiltonian $h = -\\sum_i e_i$ is shown to be\nself-adjoint with respect to this inner product. This implies that its action\non these modules is diagonalisable with real eigenvalues. A representation\ntheoretic argument shows that the reality of spectra of the Hamiltonian extends\nto all other Temperley-Lieb representations. In particular, this result applies\nto the celebrated $U_q(sl_2)$-invariant XXZ Hamiltonian, for all $q+q^{-1}\\in\n\\mathbb R$.\n", "  Products of the fusion-evaporation reaction Ca-48 + Am-243 were studied with\nthe TASISpec set-up at the gas-filled separator TASCA at the GSI\nHelmholtzzentrum f\\\"ur Schwerionenforschung. Amongst the detected thirty\ncorrelated alpha-decay chains associated with the production of element Z=115,\ntwo recoil-alpha-fission and five recoil-alpha-alpha-fission events were\nobserved. The latter are similar to four such events reported from experiments\nperformed at the Dubna gas-filled separator. Contrary to their interpretation,\nwe propose an alternative view, namely to assign eight of these eleven decay\nchains of recoil-alpha(-alpha)-fission type to start from the 3n-evaporation\nchannel 115-288. The other three decay chains remain viable candidates for the\n2n-evaporation channel 115-289.\n", "  We study the equivalence of two - order-by-order Einstein's equation and\nReduced action - approaches to cosmological perturbation theory at all orders\nfor different models of inflation. We point out a crucial consistency check\nwhich we refer to as 'Constraint consistency' that needs to be satisfied. We\npropose a quick and efficient method to check the consistency for any model\nincluding modified gravity models. Our analysis points out an important feature\nwhich is crucial for inflationary model building i.e., all `constraint'\ninconsistent models have higher order Ostrogradsky's instabilities but the\nreverse is not true. In other words, one can have models with constraint lapse\nfunction and shift vector, though it may have Ostrogradsky's instabilities. We\nalso obtain the single variable equation for non-canonical scalar field in the\nlimit of power-law inflation for the second-order perturbed variables.\n", "  In this note we consider a two-component extension of the\nKadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy represented with two types of\npseudo-differential operators, and construct its Hamiltonian structures by\nusing the $R$-matrix formalism.\n", "  We present upto date electroweak fits of various Randall Sundrum (RS) models.\nWe consider the bulk RS model, deformed RS and the custodial RS models. For the\nbulk RS case we find the lightest Kaluza Klein (KK) mode of the gauge boson to\nbe $\\sim 8$ TeV while for the custodial case it is $\\sim 3$ TeV. The deformed\nmodel is the least fine tuned of all which can give a good fit for KK masses $<\n2$ TeV depending on the choice of the model parameters. We also comment on the\nfine tuning in each case.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of 1D equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ncoupling (ERD-SOC) for cold atoms provide a disorder-free platform for the\nimplementation and observation of Majorana fermions (MFs), similar to the well\nstudied solid state nanowire/superconductor heterostructures. However, the\ncorresponding 1D chains of cold atoms possess strong quantum fluctuation, which\nmay destroy the superfluids and MFs. In this Letter, we show that such 1D\ntopological chains with MFs may be on demand generated in a 2D non-topological\noptical lattice with 1D ERD-SOC by modifying local potentials on target\nlocations using experimentally already implemented atomic gas microscopes or\npatterned (e.g., double or triple well) optical lattices. All ingredients in\nour scheme have been experimentally realized and the combination of them may\npave the way for the experimental observation of MFs in a clean system.\n", "  In this paper, we develop two classes of robust preconditioners for the\nstructure-preserving discretization of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD) system. By studying the well-posedness of the discrete system, we design\nblock preconditioners for them and carry out rigorous analysis on their\nperformance. We prove that such preconditioners are robust with respect to most\nphysical and discretization parameters. In our proof, we improve the existing\nestimates of the block triangular preconditioners for saddle point problems by\nremoving the scaling parameters, which are usually difficult to choose in\npractice. This new technique is not only applicable to the MHD system, but also\nto other problems. Moreover, we prove that Krylov iterative methods with our\npreconditioners preserve the divergence-free condition exactly, which\ncomplements the structure-preserving discretization. Another feature is that we\ncan directly generalize this technique to other discretizations of the MHD\nsystem. We also present preliminary numerical results to support the\ntheoretical results and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed\npreconditioners.\n", "  Using numerical simulations we examine colloids with a long-range Coulomb\ninteraction confined in a two-dimensional trough potential undergoing dynamical\ncompression. As the depth of the confining well is increased, the colloids move\nvia elastic distortions interspersed with intermittent bursts or avalanches of\nplastic motion. In these avalanches, the colloids rearrange to minimize their\ncolloid-colloid repulsive interaction energy by adopting an average lattice\nconstant that is isotropic despite the anisotropic nature of the compression.\nThe avalanches take the form of shear banding events that decrease or increase\nthe structural order of the system. At larger compressions, the avalanches are\nassociated with a reduction of the number of rows of colloids that fit within\nthe confining potential, and between avalanches the colloids can exhibit\npartially crystalline or even smectic ordering. The colloid velocity\ndistributions during the avalanches have a non-Gaussian form with power law\ntails and exponents that are consistent with those found for the velocity\ndistributions of gliding dislocations. We observe similar behavior when we\nsubsequently decompress the system, and find a partially hysteretic response\nreflecting the irreversibility of the plastic events.\n", "  The $B^{-}\\to D^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{-}$ decay is observed in a data sample\ncorresponding to $3.0~\\rm{fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data recorded by the LHCb\nexperiment during 2011 and 2012. Its branching fraction is measured to be\n${\\cal B}(B^{-}\\to D^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{-}) = (7.31 \\pm 0.19 \\pm 0.22 \\pm 0.39)\n\\times 10^{-5}$ where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and from\nthe branching fraction of the normalisation channel $B^{-}\\to\nD^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{-}$, respectively. An amplitude analysis of the resonant\nstructure of the $B^{-}\\to D^{+}K^{-}\\pi^{-}$ decay is used to measure the\ncontributions from quasi-two-body $B^{-}\\to D_{0}^{*}(2400)^{0}K^{-}$,\n$B^{-}\\to D_{2}^{*}(2460)^{0}K^{-}$, and $B^{-}\\to D_{J}^{*}(2760)^{0}K^{-}$\ndecays, as well as from nonresonant sources. The $D_{J}^{*}(2760)^{0}$\nresonance is determined to have spin~1.\n", "  The stages before the formation of stars in molecular clouds are poorly\nunderstood. Insights can be gained by studying the properties of quiescent\nclouds, such as their magnetic field structure. The plane-of-the-sky\norientation of the field can be traced by polarized starlight. We present the\nfirst extended, wide-field ($\\sim$10 $\\rm deg^2$) map of the Polaris Flare\ncloud in dust-absorption induced optical polarization of background stars,\nusing the RoboPol polarimeter at the Skinakas Observatory. This is the first\napplication of the wide-field imaging capabilities of RoboPol. The data were\ntaken in the R-band and analysed with the automated reduction pipeline of the\ninstrument. We present in detail optimizations in the reduction pipeline\nspecific to wide-field observations. Our analysis resulted in reliable\nmeasurements of 641 stars with median fractional linear polarization 1.3%. The\nprojected magnetic field shows a large scale ordered pattern. At high\nlongitudes it appears to align with faint striations seen in the Herschel-SPIRE\nmap of dust emission (250 $\\mu m$), while in the central 4-5 deg$^2$ it shows\nan eddy-like feature. The overall polarization pattern we obtain is in good\nagreement with large scale measurements by Planck of the dust emission\npolarization in the same area of the sky.\n", "  A new type of self-similar potential is used to study a multibarrier system\nmade of graphene. Such potential is based on the traditional middle third\nCantor set rule combined with a scaling of the barriers height. The resulting\ntransmission coefficient for charge carriers, obtained using the quantum\nrelativistic Dirac equation, shows a surprising self-similar structure. The\nsame potential does not lead to a self-similar transmission when applied to the\ntypical semiconductors described by the non-relativistic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. The proposed system is one of the few examples in which a\nself-similar structure produces the same pattern in a physical property. The\nresulting scaling properties are investigated as a function of three\nparameters: the height of the main barrier, the total length of the system and\nthe generation number of the potential. These scaling properties are first\nidentified individually and then combined to find general analytic scaling\nexpressions.\n", "  Three visible lines of M1 transitions from In-like W were recorded using the\nShanghai permanent magnet electron beam ion trap. The experimental wavelengths\nwere measured as 493.84 $\\pm$ 0.15, 226.97 $\\pm$ 0.13 and 587.63 $\\pm$ 0.23 nm\n(vacuum wavelengths). These results are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions obtained using large-scale Relativistic Many-Body Perturbation\nTheory, in the form of the Flexible Atomic Code.\n", "  We study the ground state of a dilute Bose gas in a scaling limit where the\nGross-Pitaevskii functional emerges. This is a repulsive non-linear\nSchr\\\"odinger functional whose quartic term is proportional to the scattering\nlength of the interparticle interaction potential. We propose a new derivation\nof this limit problem, with a method that bypasses some of the technical\ndifficulties that previous derivations had to face. The new method is based on\na combination of Dyson's lemma, the quantum de Finetti theorem and a second\nmoment estimate for ground states of the effective Dyson Hamiltonian. It\napplies equally well to the case where magnetic fields or rotation are present.\n", "  Relaxation dynamics of complex quantum systems with strong interactions\ntowards the steady state is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. The\nsteady state of subsystems weakly interacting with their environment is\ndescribed by the canonical ensemble which assumes the probability distribution\nfor energy to be of the Boltzmann form. The emergence of this probability\ndistribution is ensured by the detailed balance of the transitions induced by\nthe interaction with the environment. Here we consider relaxation of an open\ncorrelated quantum system brought into contact with a reservoir in the vacuum\nstate. We refer to such a system as emissive since particles irreversibly\nevaporate into the vacuum. The steady state of the system is a statistical\nmixture of the stable eigenstates arising due to the binding energy. We found\nthat, despite the absence of the detailed balance, the stationary probability\ndistribution over these eigenstates is of the Boltzmann form in each\n$N$-particle sector. A quantum statistical ensemble corresponding to the steady\nstate is characterized by different temperatures in the different sectors, in a\ncontrast to the Gibbs ensemble. We investigate the transition rates between the\neigenstates to understand the emergence of the Boltzmann distribution and find\ntheir exponential dependence on the transition energy. We argue that this\nproperty of transition rates is generic for a wide class of emissive quantum\nmany-body systems.\n", "  We construct $2^n$-families of solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation from\n$n$-products of three-dimensional $R$ and $L$ operators satisfying the\ntetrahedron equation. They are identified with the quantum $R$ matrices for the\nHopf algebras known as generalized quantum groups. Depending on the number of\n$R$'s and $L$'s involved in the product, the trace construction interpolates\nthe symmetric tensor representations of $U_q(A^{(1)}_{n-1})$ and the\nanti-symmetric tensor representations of $U_{-q^{-1}}(A^{(1)}_{n-1})$, whereas\na boundary vector construction interpolates the $q$-oscillator representation\nof $U_q(D^{(2)}_{n+1})$ and the spin representation of\n$U_{-q^{-1}}(D^{(2)}_{n+1})$. The intermediate cases are associated with an\naffinization of quantum super algebras.\n", "  We introduce the concept of equivalence among Wilson actions. Applying the\nconcept to a real scalar theory on a euclidean space, we derive the exact\nrenormalization group transformation of K. G. Wilson, and give a simple proof\nof universality of the critical exponents at any fixed point of the exact\nrenormalization group transformation. We also show how to reduce the original\nformalism of Wilson to the simplified formalism by J. Polchinski.\n", "  We consider analytically the dynamics of an arbitrary number and\nconfiguration of vortices in an annular Bose-Einstein condensate obtaining\nexpressions for the free energy and vortex precession rates to logarithmic\naccuracy. We also obtain lower bounds for the lifetime of a single vortex in\nthe annulus. Our results enable a closed-form analytic treatment of\nvortex-vortex interactions in the annulus that is exact in the incompressible\nlimit. The incompressible hydrodynamics that is developed here paves the way\nfor more general analytical treatments of vortex dynamics in non-simply\nconnected geometries.\n", "  Kinetic Vlasov equation for collisional plasmas with BGK\n(Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook) collision integral is used. The case of arbitrary\ntemperature (i.e. arbitrary degree of degeneration of electronic gas) is\nconsidered. From kinetic Vlasov equation the distribution function in\nsquare-law approximation on size of transversal electromagnetic field is\nreceived. The formula for calculation electric current is deduced. This formula\ncontains one-dimension quadrature. It is shown, that the nonlinearity account\nleads to occurrence the longitudinal electric current directed along the wave\nvector. This longitudinal current is perpendicular to the known transversal\nclassical current, received at the linear analysis. When frequency of\ncollisions tends to zero, all received results for collisional plasma pass in\nknown corresponding formulas for collisionless plasma. The case of small values\nof wave number is considered. It is shown, that the received quantity of\nlongitudinal current at tendency of frequency of collisions to zero also passes\nin known corresponding expression of current for collisionless plasmas.\n  Graphic research of dimensionless density of the current depending on wave\nnumber, frequency of oscillations of electromagnetic field and frequency of\nelectron collisions with plasma particles is carried out.\n", "  The interaction of a free-electron-laser pulse with a moderate or large size\ncluster is known to create a quasi-neutral nanoplasma, which then expands on\nhydrodynamic timescale, i.e., $>1$ ps. To have a better understanding of ion\nand electron data from experiments derived from laser-irradiated clusters, one\nneeds to simulate cluster dynamics on such long timescales for which the\nmolecular dynamics approach becomes inefficient. We therefore propose a\ntwo-step Molecular Dynamics-Hydrodynamic scheme. In the first step we use\nmolecular dynamics code to follow the dynamics of an irradiated cluster until\nall the photo-excitation and corresponding relaxation processes are finished\nand a nanoplasma, consisting of ground-state ions and thermalized electrons, is\nformed. In the second step we perform long-timescale propagation of this\nnanoplasma with a computationally efficient hydrodynamic approach.\n  In the present paper we examine the feasibility of a hydrodynamic two-fluid\napproach to follow the expansion of spherically symmetric nanoplasma, without\naccounting for the impact ionization and three-body recombination processes at\nthis stage. We compare our results with the corresponding molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We show that all relevant information about the nanoplasma\npropagation can be extracted from hydrodynamic simulations at a significantly\nlower computational cost when compared to a molecular dynamics approach.\nFinally, we comment on the accuracy and limitations of our present model and\ndiscuss possible future developments of the two-step strategy.\n", "  We present a numerical study of polyelectrolytes electrophoresing in free\nsolution while squeezed by an axisymmetric confinement force transverse to\ntheir net displacement. Hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics and molecular\ndynamics simulations with mean-field finite Debye layers show that even though\nthe polyelectrolyte chains remain \"free-draining\", their electrophoretic\nmobility increases with confinement in nanoconfining potential wells. The\nprimary mechanism leading to the increase in mobility above the free-solution\nvalue, despite long-range hydrodynamic screening by counterion layers, is the\norientation of polymer segments within Debye layers. The observed\nlength-dependence of the electrophoretic mobility arises due to secondary\neffects of counterion condensation related to confinement compactification.\n", "  The worldvolume theory of membrane is mathematically equivalent to\nthree-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields corresponding to the\ntarget space coordinates of embedded membrane. In a recent paper\n[arXiv:1503.08812] a new class of models are introduced that generate\nthree-dimensional random volumes, where the Boltzmann weight of each\nconfiguration is given by the product of values assigned to the triangles and\nthe hinges. These triangle-hinge models describe three-dimensional pure gravity\nand are characterized by semisimple associative algebras. In this paper, we\nintroduce matter degrees of freedom to the models by coloring simplices in a\nway that they have local interactions. This is achieved simply by extending the\nassociative algebras of the original triangle-hinge models, and the profile of\nmatter field is specified by the set of colors and the form of interactions.\nThe dynamics of a membrane in $D$-dimensional spacetime can then be described\nby taking the set of colors to be $\\mathbb{R}^D$. By taking another set of\ncolors, we can also realize three-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to the\nIsing model, the $q$-state Potts models or the RSOS models. One can actually\nassign colors to simplices of any dimensions (tetrahedra, triangles, edges and\nvertices), and three-dimensional colored tensor models can be realized as\ntriangle-hinge models by coloring tetrahedra, triangles and edges at a time.\n", "  We discuss connections between certain classes of supersymmetric quiver gauge\ntheories and integrable lattice models from the point of view of topological\nquantum field theories (TQFTs). The relevant classes include 4d $\\mathcal{N} =\n1$ theories known as brane box and brane tilling models, 3d $\\mathcal{N} = 2$\nand 2d $\\mathcal{N} = (2,2)$ theories obtained from them by compactification,\nand 2d $\\mathcal{N} = (0,2)$ theories closely related to these theories. We\nargue that their supersymmetric indices carry structures of TQFTs equipped with\nline operators, and as a consequence, are equal to the partition functions of\nlattice models. The integrability of these models follows from the existence of\nextra dimension in the TQFTs, which emerges after the theories are embedded in\nM-theory. The Yang-Baxter equation expresses the invariance of supersymmetric\nindices under Seiberg duality and its lower-dimensional analogs.\n", "  In this article we investigate spectral properties of the coupling\n$H+V_\\lambda$, where $H=-i\\alpha\\cdot\\nabla +m\\beta$ is the free Dirac operator\nin $\\mathbb R^3$, $m>0$ and $V_\\lambda$ is an electrostatic shell potential\n(which depends on a parameter $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb R$) located on the boundary of\na smooth domain in $\\mathbb R^3$. Our main result is an isoperimetric-type\ninequality for the admissible range of $\\lambda$'s for which the coupling\n$H+V_\\lambda$ generates pure point spectrum in $(-m,m)$. That the ball is the\nunique optimizer of this inequality is also shown. Regarding some ingredients\nof the proof, we make use of the Birman-Schwinger principle adapted to our\nsetting in order to prove some monotonicity property of the admissible\n$\\lambda$'s, and we use this to relate the endpoints of the admissible range of\n$\\lambda$'s to the sharp constant of a quadratic form inequality, from which\nthe isoperimetric-type inequality is derived.\n", "  Let $G$ be a finite group. Noncommutative geometry of unital $G$-algebras is\nstudied. A geometric structure is determined by a spectral triple on the\ncrossed product algebra associated with the group action. This structure is to\nbe viewed as a representative of a noncommutative orbifold. Based on a study of\nclassical orbifold groupoids, a Morita equivalence for the crossed product\nspectral triples is developed. Noncommutative orbifolds are Morita equivalence\nclasses of the crossed product spectral triples. As a special case of this\nMorita theory one can study freeness of the $G$-action on the noncommutative\nlevel. In the case of a free action, the crossed product formalism reduced to\nthe usual spectral triple formalism on the algebra of $G$-invariant functions.\n", "  Research on transport, self-assembly and defect dynamics within confined,\nflowing liquid crystals requires versatile and computationally efficient\nmesoscopic algorithms to account for fluctuating nematohydrodynamic\ninteractions. We present a multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) based\nalgorithm to simulate liquid-crystal hydrodynamic and director fields in two\nand three dimensions. The nematic-MPCD method is shown to successfully\nreproduce the features of a nematic liquid crystal, including a\nnematic-isotropic phase transition with hysteresis in 3D, defect dynamics,\nisotropic Frank elastic coefficients, tumbling and shear alignment regimes and\nboundary condition dependent order parameter fields.\n", "  In the theory of open quantum systems interaction is a fundamental concepts\nin the review of the dynamics of open quantum systems. Correlation, both\nclassical and quantum one, is generated due to interaction between system and\nenvironment. Here, we recall the quantity which well known as total entropy\nproduction. Appearance of total entropy production is due to the entanglement\nproduction between system an environment. In this work, we discuss about the\nrole of the total entropy production for detecting non-Markovianity. By\nutilizing the relation between total entropy production and total correlation\nbetween subsystems, one can see a temporary decrease of total entropy\nproduction is a signature of non-Markovianity.\n", "  We construct solutions of analogues of the nonstationary Schr\\\"odinger\nequation corresponding to the polynomial isomonodromic Hamiltonian Garnier\nsystem with two degrees of freedom. This solutions are obtained from solutions\nof systems of linear ordinary differential equations whose compatibility\ncondition is the Garnier system. This solutions upto explicit transform also\nsatisfy the Belavin --- Polyakov --- Zamolodchikov equations with four time\nvariables and two space variables.\n", "  In this paper we report on the results of a numerical study of the nonlinear\ntime-dependent Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) equations, often also denoted\nas Bogoliubov--de--Gennes (BdG) equations, for a one-dimensional system of\nfermions with contact interaction. We show that, even above the critical\ntemperature, the full equations and their linear approximation give rise to\ncompletely different evolutions. In contrast to its linearization, the full\nnonlinear equation does not show any diffusive behavior in the order parameter.\nThis means that the order parameter does not follow a Ginzburg--Landau-type of\nequation, in accordance with a recent theoretical results. We include a full\ndescription on the numerical implementation of the partial differential BCS\\\nBdG equations.\n", "  We introduce a new set of simulations of Milky Way-sized galaxies using the\nAMR code ART + hydrodynamics in a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmogony. The simulation series\nis named GARROTXA and follow the formation of a halo/galaxy from z~$=$~60 to\nz~$=$~0. The final virial mass of the system is\n$\\sim$7.4$\\times$10$^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$. Our results are as follows: (a) contrary\nto many previous studies, the circular velocity curve shows no central peak and\noverall agrees with recent MW observations. (b) Other quantities, such as\nM$\\_{*}$(6$\\times$10$^{10}$M$_\\odot$) and R$_d$ (2.56 kpc), fall well inside\nthe observational MW range. (c) We measure the disk-to-total ratio\nkinematically and find that D/T=0.42. (d) The cold gas fraction and star\nformation rate (SFR) at z=0, on the other hand, fall short from the values\nestimated for the Milky Way. As a first scientific exploitation of the\nsimulation series, we study the spatial distribution of the hot X-ray luminous\ngas. We have found that most of this X-ray emitting gas is in a halo-like\ndistribution accounting for an important fraction but not all of the missing\nbaryons. An important amount of hot gas is also present in filaments. In all\nour models there is not a massive disk-like hot gas distribution dominating the\ncolumn density. Our analysis of hot gas mock observations reveals that the\nhomogeneity assumption leads to an overestimation of the total mass by factors\n3 to 5 or to an underestimation by factors $0.7-0.1$, depending on the used\nobservational method. Finally, we confirm a clear correlation between the total\nhot gas mass and the dark matter halo mass of galactic systems.\n", "  We derive an explicit generating function of correlations functions of an\narbitrary tau-function of the KdV hierarchy. In particular applications, our\nformulation gives closed formul\\ae\\ of a new type for the generating series of\nintersection numbers of $\\psi$-classes as well as of mixed $\\psi$- and\n$\\kappa$-classes in full genera.\n", "  We discuss an alternative for Baryon-violating six quarks transitions, in the\ncontest of low scale string theory. In particular, with $M_{S}=10\\div 10^{3}\\rm\nTeV$, such a transition can be mediated by two color-triplets,through a quartic\ncoupling with down-quarks,generated by exotic instantons, in a calculable and\ncontrollable way. We show how FCNCs limits on color-triplet massare well\ncompatible with $n-\\bar{n}$ oscillation ones. If a $n-\\bar{n}$ transition were\nfound, this would be an indirect hint for our model.\n  This would strongly motivate researches of direct channels in proton-proton\ncolliders. In fact, our model can be directly tested in a experimentally\nchallenging $100\\div 1000\\, \\rm TeV$ proton-proton collider, searching for our\ndesired color-triplet states and an evidence for exotic instantons resonances,\nin addition to stringy Regge resonances, anomalous $Z'$-bosons and gauged\nmegaxion. In particular, our scenario can be related to the $750\\, \\rm GeV$\ndiphoton hint identifying it with the gauged megaxion dual to the $B$-field. On\nthe other hand, this scenario is compatible with TeV-ish color triplets visible\nat LHC and with $1\\div 10\\, \\rm TeV$- string scale, {\\it i.e} stringy\nresonances at LHC.\n", "  We study how the stability of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is\ninfluenced by the geometry of band structure in lattice Chern insulators. We\nconsider the Hofstadter model, which converges to continuum Landau levels in\nthe limit of small flux per plaquette. This gives us a degree of analytic\ncontrol not possible in generic lattice models, and we are able to obtain\nanalytic expressions for the relevant geometric criteria. These may be\ndifferentiated by whether they converge exponentially or polynomially to the\ncontinuum limit. We demonstrate that the latter criteria have a dominant effect\non the physics of interacting particles in Hofstadter bands in this low flux\ndensity regime. In particular, we show that the many-body gap depends\nmonotonically on a band-geometric criterion related to the trace of the\nFubini-Study metric.\n", "  Effects are investigated of CP symmetry violation in the decay of a scalar\nparticle X (the Higgs boson) into two off-mass-shell Z bosons both decaying\ninto a fermion-antifermion pair, $X \\to Z_1^* \\, Z_2^* \\to f_1 \\bar{f_1} \\, f_2\n\\bar{f_2}$. The most general form of the amplitude of the transition $X \\to\nZ_1^* Z_2^*$, wherein the boson X may not have definite CP parity, is\nconsidered. Limits of applicability of the narrow-Z-width approximation used\nwhen obtaining differential widths of the decay under consideration are\ndetermined. Various observables connected with the structure of the amplitude\nof the decay $X \\to Z_1^* Z_2^*$ are studied. These observables are analyzed in\nthe Standard Model, as well as in models conceding indefinite CP parity of the\nHiggs boson. An experimental measurement at the LHC of angular and invariant\nmass distributions of the decay $X \\to Z_1^* Z_2^* \\to f_1 \\bar{f_1} f_2\n\\bar{f_2}$ can give information about the CP properties of the Higgs boson and\nits interaction with the Z boson.\n", "  The charge transfer (ionization) of hydrogen Rydberg atoms (principal quantum\nnumber $n=25-34$) incident at a Cu(100) surface is investigated. Unlike fully\nmetallic surfaces, where the Rydberg electron energy is degenerate with the\nconduction band of the metal, the Cu(100) surface has a projected bandgap at\nthese energies, and only discrete image states are available through which\ncharge transfer can take place. Resonant enhancement of charge transfer is\nobserved at hydrogen principal quantum numbers for which the Rydberg energy\nmatches the energy of one of the image states. The integrated surface\nionization signals show clear periodicity as the energies of states with\nincreasing $n$ come in and out of resonance with the image states. The velocity\ndependence of the surface ionization dynamics is also investigated. Decreased\nvelocity of the incident H atom leads to a greater mean distance of ionization\nand a lower field required to extract the ion. The surface-ionization profiles\n(signal versus applied field) for `on resonance' $n$ values show a changing\nshape as the velocity is changed, reflecting the restriction of the resonance\nto a certain range of applied field.\n", "  We use the Chern-Simons formulation of higher spin theories in three\ndimensions to study aspects of holographic W-gravity. Concepts which were\nuseful in studies of pure bulk gravity theories, such as the Fefferman-Graham\ngauge and the residual gauge transformations, which induce Weyl transformations\nin the boundary theory and their higher spin generalizations, are reformulated\nin the Chern-Simons language. Flat connections that correspond to conformal and\nlightcone gauges in the boundary theory are considered.\n", "  Energy dependence of space-time parameters of pion emission region at\nfreeze-out is studied for collisions of various ions and for all experimentally\navailable energies. The using of femtoscopic radii scaled on the averaged\nradius of colliding ions is suggested. This approach allows the expansion of\nthe set of interaction types, in particular, on collisions of non-symmetrical\nion beams which can be studied within the framework of common treatment. There\nis no sharp changing of femtoscopic parameter values with increasing of initial\nenergy. Analytic functions suggested for smooth approximations of energy\ndependence of femtoscopic parameters demonstrate reasonable agreement with most\nof experimental data at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\geq 5$ GeV. Estimations of some\nobservables are obtained for energies of the LHC and FCC project.\n", "  We show that the emptiness formation probability of the six-vertex model with\ndomain wall boundary conditions at its free-fermion point is a $\\tau$-function\nof the sixth Painlev\\'e equation. Using this fact we derive asymptotics of the\nemptiness formation probability in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We propose a method to define a $d+1$ dimensional geometry from a $d$\ndimensional quantum field theory in the $1/N$ expansion. We first construct a\n$d+1$ dimensional field theory from the $d$ dimensional one via the gradient\nflow equation, whose flow time $t$ represents the energy scale of the system\nsuch that $t\\rightarrow 0$ corresponds to the ultra-violet (UV) while\n$t\\rightarrow\\infty$ to the infra-red (IR). We then define the induced metric\nfrom $d+1$ dimensional field operators. We show that the metric defined in this\nway becomes classical in the large $N$ limit, in a sense that quantum\nfluctuations of the metric are suppressed as $1/N$ due to the large $N$\nfactorization property. As a concrete example, we apply our method to the O(N)\nnon-linear $\\sigma$ model in two dimensions. We calculate the three dimensional\ninduced metric, which is shown to describe an AdS space in the massless limit.\nWe finally discuss several open issues in future studies.\n", "  Complex doping schemes in RE$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ (RE=rare earth element) garnet\ncompounds have recently led to pronounced improvements in scintillator\nperformance. Specifically, by admixing lutetium and yttrium aluminate garnets\nwith gallium and gadolinium, the band-gap was altered in a manner that\nfacilitated the removal of deleterious electron trapping associated with cation\nantisite defects. Here, we expand upon this initial work to systematically\ninvestigate the effect of substitutional admixing on the energy levels of band\nedges. Density functional theory was used to survey potential admixing\ncandidates that modify either the conduction band minimum (CBM) or valence band\nmaximum (VBM). We considered two sets of compositions based on\nLu$_3$B$_5$O$_{12}$ where B = Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb; and RE$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$,\nwhere RE = Lu, Gd, Dy, and Er. We found that admixing with various RE cations\ndoes not appreciably effect the band gap or band edges. In contrast,\nsubstituting Al with cations of dissimilar ionic radii has a profound impact on\nthe band structure. We further show that certain dopants can be used to\nselectively modify only the CBM or the VBM. Specifically, Ga and In decrease\nthe band gap by lowering the CBM, while As and Sb decrease the band gap by\nraising the VBM. These results demonstrate a powerful approach to quickly\nscreen the impact of dopants on the electronic structure of scintillator\ncompounds, identifying those dopants which alter the band edges in very\nspecific ways to eliminate both electron and hole traps responsible for\nperformance limitations. This approach should be broadly applicable for the\noptimization of electronic and optical performance for a wide range of\ncompounds by tuning the VBM and CBM.\n", "  We present an updated empirical analysis on the ratio of the elastic\n(integrated) to the total cross section in the c.m. energy interval from 5 GeV\nto 8 TeV. As in a previous work, we use a suitable analytical parametrization\nfor that ratio (depending on only four free fit parameters) and investigate\nthree asymptotic scenarios: either the black disk limit or scenarios above or\nbelow that limit. The dataset includes now the datum at 7 TeV, recently\nreported by the ATLAS Collaboration. Our analysis favors, once more, a scenario\nbelow the black disk, providing an asymptotic ratio consistent with the\nrational value 1/3, namely a gray disk limit. Upper bounds for the ratio of the\ndiffractive (dissociative) to the inelastic cross section are also presented.\n", "  We explain the excess of the antiproton fraction recently reported by the\nAMS-02 experiment by considering collisions between cosmic-ray protons\naccelerated by a local supernova remnant (SNR) and the surrounding dense cloud.\nThe same \"$pp$-collisions\" provide the right ratio of daughter particles to fit\nthe observed positron excess simultaneously in the natural model parameters.\nThe supernova happened in relatively lower metalicity than the major cosmic-ray\nsources. The cutoff energy of electrons marks the supernova age of $\\sim\n10^{5}$ years, while the antiproton excess may extend to higher energy. Both\nantiproton and positron fluxes are completely consistent with our predictions\nin Fujita, Kohri, Yamasaki and Ioka (2009).\n", "  We study spatial coherence near a classical environment by loading a\nBose-Einstein condensate into a magnetic lattice potential and observing\ndiffraction. Even very close to a surface (5$\\,\\mu$m), and even when the\nsurface is at room temperature, spatial coherence persists for a relatively\nlong time ($\\ge$500$\\,$ms). In addition, the observed spatial coherence extends\nover several lattice sites, a significantly greater distance than the\natom-surface separation. This opens the door for atomic circuits, and may help\nelucidate the interplay between spatial dephasing, inter-atomic interactions,\nand external noise.\n", "  Light-by-light scatterings contain rich information on the photon coupling to\nvirtual and real particle states. In the context of quantum electrodynamics\n(QED), photons can couple to a virtual $e^+e^-$ pair. Photons may also couple\nto known resonance states in the context of quantum chromodyanmics and\nelectroweak dynamics in higher energy domains and possibly couple to unknown\nresonance states beyond the starndard model. The perturbative QED calculations\nmanifestly predict the maximized cross section at the MeV scale, however, any\nexample of the exact real-photon - real-photon scattering has not been observed\nhitherto. Hence, we propose the direct measurement with the maximized\ncross-section at the center-of-mass system energy of 1-2 MeV to establish the\nfirm footing at the MeV scale. Given currently state-of-the-art high power\nlasers, the helicity dependent elastic scattering may be observed at a\nreasonable rate, if a photon-photon collider exploiting $\\gamma$-rays generated\nby the inverse nonlinear Compton process with electrons delivered from\nlaser-plasma accelerators (LPA) are properly designed. We show that such\nverification is feasible in a table-top scale collider which may be an\nunprecedented breakthrough in particle accelerators for basic physics research\nin contrast to energy frontier colliders.\n", "  We point out that neutrino oscillations imply an ambiguity in the definition\nof the vacuum and the coupling to gravity, with experimentally observable\nconsequences due to the Unruh effect. In an accelerating frame, the detector\nshould see a bath of mass Eigenstates neutrinos. In inertial processes,\nneutrinos are produced and absorbed as charge Eigenstates. The two cannot be\nreconciled by a spacetime coordinate transformation. This makes manifestations\nof the Unruh effect in neutrino physics a promising probe of both neutrinos and\nfundamental quantum field theory. In this respect, we suggest $p\\rightarrow n\n+\\ell^+ + {\\nu_\\ell}$ ($\\ell^+ = e^+, \\mu^+, \\tau^+$) transitions in strong\nelectromagnetic fields as a promising avenue of investigation. In this essay we\ndiscuss this process both in the inertial and comoving frame, we briefly\ndescribe the experimental realization and its challenges, and close by\nspeculating on possible results of such an experiment in different scenarios of\nfundamental neutrino physics\n", "  In the setting of the principle of local equilibrium which asserts that the\ntemperature is a function of the energy levels of the system, we exhibit plenty\nof steady states describing the condensation of free Bosons which are not in\nthermal equilibrium. The surprising facts are that the condensation can occur\nboth in dimension less than 3 in configuration space, and even in excited\nenergy levels. The investigation relative to non equilibrium suggests a new\napproach to the condensation, which allows an unified analysis involving also\nthe condensation of $q$-particles, $-1\\leq q\\leq 1$, where $q=\\pm1$ corresponds\nto the Bose/Fermi alternative. For such $q$-particles, the condensation can\noccur only if $0<q\\leq1$, the case 1 corresponding to the standard\nBose-Einstein condensation. In this more general approach, completely new and\nunexpected states exhibiting condensation phenomena naturally occur also in the\nusual situation of equilibrium thermodynamics. The new approach proposed in the\npresent paper for the situation of $2^\\text{nd}$ quantisation of free\nparticles, is naturally based on the theory of the Distributions, which might\nhopefully be extended to more general cases\n", "  We present a study of the recent star formation of 30 Doradus in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) using the panchromatic imaging survey Hubble Tarantula\nTreasury Project (HTTP). In this paper we focus on the stars within 20 pc of\nthe center of the massive ionizing cluster of 30 Doradus, NGC 2070. We\nrecovered the star formation history by comparing deep optical and NIR\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) with state-of-the-art synthetic CMDs generated\nwith the latest PARSEC models, which include all stellar phases from pre-main\nsequence to post- main sequence. For the first time in this region we are able\nto measure the star formation using intermediate and low mass stars\nsimultaneously. Our results suggest that NGC2070 experienced a prolonged\nactivity. In particular, we find that the star formation in the region: i)\nexceeded the average LMC rate ~ 20 Myr ago; ii) accelerated dramatically ~ 7\nMyr ago; and iii) reached a peak value 1-3 Myr ago. We did not find significant\ndeviations from a Kroupa initial mass function down to 0.5 Msun. The average\ninternal reddening E(B-V) is found to be between 0.3 and 0.4 mag.\n", "  In the last decade, a combination of high sensitivity, high spatial\nresolution observations and of coordinated multi-wavelength surveys has\nrevolutionized our view of extra-galactic black hole (BH) astrophysics. We now\nknow that supermassive black holes reside in the nuclei of almost every galaxy,\ngrow over cosmological times by accreting matter, interact and merge with each\nother, and in the process liberate enormous amounts of energy that influence\ndramatically the evolution of the surrounding gas and stars, providing a\npowerful self-regulatory mechanism for galaxy formation. The different\nenergetic phenomena associated to growing black holes and Active Galactic\nNuclei (AGN), their cosmological evolution and the observational techniques\nused to unveil them, are the subject of this chapter. In particular, I will\nfocus my attention on the connection between the theory of high-energy\nastrophysical processes giving rise to the observed emission in AGN, the\nobservable imprints they leave at different wavelengths, and the methods used\nto uncover them in a statistically robust way. I will show how such a combined\neffort of theorists and observers have led us to unveil most of the SMBH growth\nover a large fraction of the age of the Universe, but that nagging\nuncertainties remain, preventing us from fully understating the exact role of\nblack holes in the complex process of galaxy and large-scale structure\nformation, assembly and evolution.\n", "  To make precise the sense in which nature fails to respect classical physics,\none requires a formal notion of classicality. Ideally, such a notion should be\ndefined operationally, so that it can be subjected to a direct experimental\ntest, and it should be applicable in a wide variety of experimental scenarios,\nso that it can cover the breadth of phenomena that are thought to defy\nclassical understanding. Bell's notion of local causality fulfills the first\ncriterion but not the second. The notion of noncontextuality fulfills the\nsecond criterion, but it is a long-standing question whether it can be made to\nfulfill the first. Previous attempts to experimentally test noncontextuality\nhave all presumed certain idealizations that do not hold in real experiments,\nnamely, noiseless measurements and exact operational equivalences. We here show\nhow to devise tests that are free of these idealizations. We also perform a\nphotonic implementation of one such test that rules out noncontextual models\nwith high confidence.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupled bosons can exhibit rich equilibrium phases at low\ntemperature and in the presence of particle-particle interactions. In the case\nwith a 1D synthetic spin-orbit interaction, it has been observed that the\nground state of a Bose gas can be a normal phase, stripe phase, or magnetized\nphase in different experimentally controllable parameter regimes. The\nmagnetized states are doubly degenerate and consist of a many-particle\ntwo-state system. In this work, we investigate the nonequilibrium quantum\ndynamics by switching on an external perturbation to induce resonant couplings\nbetween the magnetized phases, and predict the novel quantum spin dynamics\nwhich cannot be obtained in the single-particle systems. In particular, due to\nparticle-particle interactions, the transition of the Bose condensate from one\nmagnetized phase to the other is forbidden when the strength of external\nperturbation is less than a critical value, and a full transition can occur\nonly when the perturbation exceeds such critical strength. This phenomenon\nmanifests itself a quantum dynamical phase transition, with the critical point\nbehavior being exactly solvable. From the numerical simulations and exact\nanalytic studies we show that the predicted many-body effects can be well\nobserved with the current experiments.\n", "  We consider the potential-model approach for obtaining the spectrum of\ncharmonium and bottomonium, replacing the usual gluon propagator by one\nobtained from lattice simulations. The resulting spectra are compared to the\ncorresponding ones in the Cornell-potential case. We also estimate the\ninterquark distance in both cases.\n", "  We study the diffusiophoretic self-propulsion of a colloidal catalytic\nparticle due to a surface chemical reaction in a vicinity of a solid wall.\nDiffusiophoresis is a chemico-mechanical transduction mechanism in which a\nconcentration gradient of an interacting solute produces an unbalanced force on\na colloidal particle and drives it along the gradient. We consider a spherical\nparticle with an axisymmetric reacting cap covering the polar angle range $0\\le\n\\theta\\le \\theta_{cap}$ in the presence of a repulsive solute, near an infinite\nplanar wall, and solve the coupled solute concentration and Stokes equations,\nusing a mixture of numerical and analytic arguments. The resulting particle\ntrajectory is determined by $\\theta_{cap}$ and the initial orientation of the\nsymmetry axis with respect to the plane. At normal incidence the particle\ninitially moves away from or towards the wall, depending on whether the cap\nfaces towards or away, respectively, but even in the latter case the particle\nnever reaches the wall due to hydrodynamic lubrication resistance. For other\ninitial orientations, when $\\theta_{cap}\\le 115^{\\circ}$ the particle either\nmoves away immediately or else rotates along its trajectory so as to cause the\nactive side to face the wall and the particle to rebound. For higher coverage\nwe find trajectories where the particle skims along the wall at constant\nseparation or else comes to rest. We provide a phase diagram giving the nature\nof the trajectory (repulsion, rebound, skimming or stationary) as a function of\n$\\theta_{cap}$ and the initial orientation.\n", "  In complex materials observed electronic phases and transitions between them\noften involves coupling between many degrees of freedom whose entanglement\nconvolutes understanding of the instigating mechanism. Metal-insulator\ntransitions are one such problem where coupling to the structural, orbital,\ncharge, and magnetic order parameters frequently obscures the underlying\nphysics. Here, we demonstrate a way to unravel this conundrum by\nheterostructuring a prototypical multi-ordered complex oxide NdNiO3 in ultra\nthin geometry, which preserves the metal-to-insulator transition and bulk-like\nmagnetic order parameter, but entirely suppresses the symmetry lowering and\ncharge order parameter. These findings illustrate the utility of\nheterointerfaces as a powerful method for removing competing order parameters\nto gain greater insight into the nature of the transition, here revealing that\nthe magnetic order generates the transition independently, leading to a purely\nelectronic Mott metal-insulator transition.\n", "  We report coherent enhancement of two-photon emission from the excited\nvibrational state of molecular hydrogen triggered by irradiating mid-infrared\npulses externally. We previously observed the two-photon emission triggered by\nthe internally generated fourth Stokes photons. By injecting independent\nmid-infrared pulses externally, it is possible to control experimental\nparameters and investigate the mechanism in more detail. In this article, we\ndescribe the two-photon emission using the external trigger pulses. Its\nspectrum and dependence on the energy and timing of the trigger pulse are\npresented along with numerical simulations based on the Maxwell-Bloch\nequations. The measured number of emitted photons is 6 10^11 photons/pulse and\nthe resulting enhancement factor from the spontaneous emission is more than\n10^18. This value is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the previous\nexperiment. External control of emission process is expected to be essential\nfor observation of weaker process of radiative emission of neutrino pair.\n", "  Systematic studies on the gain and the energy resolution have been carried\nout varying the voltage across the GEM foils for both single mask and double\nmask triple GEM detector prototypes. Variation of the gain and the energy\nresolution have also been measured varying either the drift voltage, transfer\nvoltage and induction voltage keeping other voltages constant. The results of\nthe systematic measurements has been presented.\n", "  We consider temporal correlations of particles with arbitrary spin. We show\nthat the Leggett-Garg inequality can be maximally violated irrespective of the\nvalue of spin, thus improving upon an earlier result by Kofler and Brukner\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{99}, 180403 (2007)]. Our proof is accomplished\nthrough a suitable adoption of a measurement scheme which has previously been\nemployed for studying the spatial correlation in a system with arbitrary spin.\nWe next consider generalized or unsharp measurements as a method for coarse\ngraining in a quantitative manner, and show that classicality emerges below a\nprecise value of the sharpness parameter. Satisfaction of the Leggett-Garg\ninequality is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for macroscopic\nrealism.\n", "  We identify 4 unusually bright (H < 25.5) galaxies from HST and Spitzer\nCANDELS data with probable redshifts z ~ 7-9. These identifications include the\nbrightest-known galaxies to date at z > 7.5. As Y-band observations are not\navailable over the full CANDELS program to perform a standard Lyman-break\nselection of z > 7 galaxies, we employ an alternate strategy using deep\nSpitzer/IRAC data. We identify z ~ 7.1 - 9.1 galaxies by selecting z >~ 6\ngalaxies from the HST CANDELS data that show quite red IRAC [3.6]-[4.5] colors,\nindicating strong [OIII]+Hbeta lines in the 4.5 micron band. This selection\nstrategy was validated using a modest sample for which we have deep Y-band\ncoverage, and subsequently used to select the brightest z > 7 sources. Applying\nthe IRAC criteria to all HST-selected optical-dropout galaxies over the full\n~900 arcmin**2 of the CANDELS survey revealed four unusually bright z ~ 7.1,\n7.6, 7.9 and 8.6 candidates. The median [3.6]-[4.5] color of our selected z ~\n7.1-9.1 sample is consistent with rest-frame [OIII]+Hbeta EWs of ~1500A, in the\n[4.5] band. Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy has been independently reported for two\nof our selected sources, showing Ly-alpha at redshifts of 7.7302+/-0.0006 and\n8.683^+0.001_-0.004, respectively. We present similar Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy\nfor a third selected galaxy with a probable 4.7sigma Ly-alpha line at\nz_spec=7.4770+/-0.0008. All three have H-band magnitudes of ~25 mag and are\n~0.5 mag more luminous (M(UV) ~ -22.0) than any previously discovered z ~ 8\ngalaxy, with important implications for the UV LF. Our 3 brightest, highest\nredshift z > 7 galaxies all lie within the CANDELS EGS field, providing a\ndramatic illustration of the potential impact of field-to-field variance.\n", "  Modulated (p)reheating is thought to be an alternative mechanism for\nproducing super-horizon curvature perturbations in CMB. But large\nnon-gaussianity and iso-curvature perturbations produced by this mechanism rule\nout its acceptability as the sole process responsible for generating CMB\nperturbations. We explore the situation where CMB perturbations are mostly\ngenerated by usual quantum fluctuations of inflaton during inflation, but a\nmodulated coupling constant between inflaton and a secondary scalar affects the\npreheating process and produces some extra curvature perturbations. If the\nmodulating scalar field is considered to be a dark matter candidate, coupling\nconstant between the fields has to be unnaturally fine tuned in order to keep\nthe local-form non-gaussianity and the amplitude of iso-curvature perturbations\nwithin observational limit; otherwise parameters of the models have to be\ntightly constrained. Those constraints imply that the curvature perturbations\ngenerated by modulated preheating should be less than 15% of the total observed\nCMB perturbations. On the other hand if the modulating scalar field is not a\ndark matter candidate, parameters of the models could not be constrained, but\nthe constraints on the maximum amount of the curvature perturbations coming\nfrom modulated preheating remain valid.\n", "  We reinforce the observations of almost stable scattering in nonintegrable\nmodels and show that $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry can be used as a guiding principle\nto select relevant systems also when it comes to integrability properties. We\nshow that the presence of unbroken $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in classical field\ntheories produces quasi-integrable excitations with asymptotically conserved\ncharges.\n", "  We study small, PT-symmetric perturbations of self-adjoint double-well\nSchr\\\"odinger operators in dimension $n\\geq 1$. We prove that the eigenvalues\nstay real for a very small perturbation, then bifurcate to the complex plane as\nthe perturbation gets stronger.\n", "  We give a simple non-mathematical explanation of Bell's inequality. Using the\ninequality, we show how the results of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)\nexperiments violate the principle of strong locality, also known as local\ncausality. This indicates, given some reasonable-sounding assumptions, that\nsome sort of faster-than-light influence is present in nature. We discuss the\nimplications, emphasizing the relationship between EPR and the Principle of\nRelativity, the distinction between causal influences and signals, and the\ntension between EPR and determinism.\n", "  According to Padmanabhan's proposal, the difference between the surface\ndegrees of freedom and the bulk degrees of freedom in a region of space may\nresult in the acceleration of Universe expansion through the relation $\\Delta\nV/\\Delta t = N_{\\rm sur}-N_{\\rm bulk}$ where $N_{\\rm bulk}$ and $N_{\\rm sur}$\nare referred to the degrees of freedom related to the matter and energy content\ninside the bulk and surface area, respectively \\cite{Pad1}. In this paper, we\nstudy the dynamical effect of the extrinsic geometrical embedding of an\narbitrary four dimensional brane in a higher dimensional bulk space and\ninvestigate the corresponding degrees of freedom. Considering the modification\nof Friedmann equations arising from a general braneworld scenario, we obtain a\ncorrection term in Padmanabhan's relation, denoting the number of degrees of\nfreedom related to the extrinsic geometry of the brane embedded in higher\ndimensional spacetime as $\\Delta V /\\Delta t=N_{\\rm sur}-N_{\\rm bulk}-N_{\\rm\nextr}$ where $N_{\\rm extr}$ is referred to the degree of freedom related to the\nextrinsic geometry of the brane while $N_{\\rm sur}$ and $N_{\\rm bulk}$ are as\nwell as before. Finally, we study the validity of the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics for this general braneworld scenario in the state of thermal\nequilibrium and in the presence of confined matter fields to the brane with the\ninduced geometric matter fields.\n", "  When a light bulb is turned on, light moves away from it at speed $c$, by\ndefinition. When light from this bulb illuminates a surface, however, this\nillumination front is not constrained to move at speed $c$. A simple proof is\ngiven that this illumination front always moves {\\it faster} than $c$.\nGeneralized, when any compact light source itself varies, this information\nspreads across all of the surfaces it illuminates at speeds faster than light.\n", "  We investigate the horizon structure of the rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld\nsolution which goes over to the Einstein-Maxwell's Kerr-Newman solution as the\nBorn-Infeld parameter goes to infinity ($\\beta \\rightarrow \\infty$). We find\nthat for a given $\\beta$, mass $M$ and charge $Q$, there exist critical\nspinning parameter $a_{E}$ and $r_{H}^{E}$, which corresponds to an extremal\nEinstein-Born-Infeld black hole with degenerate horizons, and $a_{E}$ decreases\nand $r_{H}^{E}$ increases with increase in the Born-Infeld parameter $\\beta$.\nWhile $a<a_{E}$ describe a non-extremal Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with\nouter and inner horizons. Similarly, the effect of $\\beta$ on infinite redshift\nsurface and in turn on ergoregion is also included. It is well known that a\nblack hole can cast a shadow as an optical appearance due to its strong\ngravitational field. We also investigate the shadow cast by the non-rotating\n($a=0$) Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole and demonstrate that the null geodesic\nequations can be integrated that allows us to investigate the shadow cast by a\nblack hole which is found to be a dark zone covered by a circle. Interestingly,\nthe shadow of the Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole is slightly smaller than for\nthe Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. F urther, the shadow is concentric circles\nwhose radius decreases with increase in value of parameter $\\beta$.\n", "  In this note, we consider so-called \"Higgs Branch Localization\" for four\ndimensional N=2 field theories on 4d ellipsoid. We find a new set of saddle\npoint equations arising from additional Higgs branch deformation term, whose\nsolutions include both Higgs branch and BPS instanton-vortex mixed\nconfigurations. By evaluating the contour integral, we also demonstrate the\nellipsoid partition almost factorizes into purely b and 1/b dependent parts,\nusing SQCD as an explicit example. We identify various factorized parts with\nthe ellipsoid partition function of two dimensional N=(2,2) SQCDA, which is\nprecisely the vortex world volume theory. We also give physical interpretation\nfor the non-factorizable parts and discuss future directions.\n", "  A hidden order that emerges in the frustrated pyrochlore\nTb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ with $T_{\\text{c}}=0.53$ K is studied using\nspecific heat, magnetization, and neutron scattering experiments on a\nhigh-quality single crystal. Semi-quantitative analyses based on a\npseudospin-1/2 Hamiltonian for ionic non-Kramers magnetic doublets demonstrate\nthat it is an ordered state of electric quadrupole moments. The elusive spin\nliquid state of the nominal Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is most likely a U(1) quantum\nspin-liquid state.\n", "  We generalise our previous result\\cite{13} to cases with three and four\nWilson lines. We show that the Nekrasov-type formula for E-string theory is\nvalid for those cases and the Seiberg-Witten curves are reproduced from the\nformula. In addition, we show the dependence of the Seiberg-Witten curve on the\nWilson lines.\n", "  The [O III] $\\lambda\\lambda$ 4959,5007 lines are a useful proxy to test the\nkinematic of the narrow-line region (NLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). In\nAGN, and particularly in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) these lines\noften show few peculiar features, such as blue wings, often interpreted as\noutflowing component, and a shift $-$ typically toward lower wavelengths $-$ of\nthe whole spectroscopic feature in some exceptional sources, the so-called blue\noutliers, which are often associated to strong winds. We investigated the\nincidence of these peculiarities in two samples of radio-emitting NLS1s, one\nradio-loud and one radio-quiet. We also studied a few correlations between the\nobservational properties of the [O III] lines and those of the AGN. Our aim was\nto understand the difference between radio-quiet and radio-loud NLS1s, which\nmay in turn provide useful information on the jet formation mechanism. We find\nthat the NLR gas is much more perturbed in radio-loud than in radio-quiet\nNLS1s. In particular the NLR dynamics in $\\gamma$-ray emitting NLS1s appears to\nbe highly disturbed, and this might be a consequence of interaction with the\nrelativistic jet. The less frequently perturbed NLR in radio-quiet NLS1s\nsuggests instead that these sources likely do not harbor a fully developed\nrelativistic jet. Nonetheless blue-outliers in radio-quiet NLS1s are observed,\nand we interpret them as a product of strong winds.\n", "  Graphene's linear dispersion relation and the attendant implications for\nbipolar electronics applications have motivated a range of experimental efforts\naimed at producing p-n junctions in graphene. Here we report electrical\ntransport measurements of graphene p-n junctions formed via simple\nmodifications to a PbZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_3$ substrate, combined with a\nself-assembled layer of ambient environmental dopants. We show that the\nsubstrate configuration controls the local doping region, and that the p-n\njunction behavior can be controlled with a single gate. Finally, we show that\nthe ferroelectric substrate induces a hysteresis in the environmental doping\nwhich can be utilized to activate and deactivate the doping, yielding an\n`on-demand' p-n junction in graphene controlled by a single, universal\nbackgate.\n", "  Disordered fibrous networks are ubiquitous in nature as major structural\ncomponents of living cells and tissues. The mechanical stability of networks\ngenerally depends on the degree of connectivity: only when the average number\nof connections between nodes exceeds the isostatic threshold are networks\nstable (Maxwell, J. C., Philosophical Magazine 27, 294 (1864)). Upon increasing\nthe connectivity through this point, such networks undergo a mechanical phase\ntransition from a floppy to a rigid phase. However, even sub-isostatic networks\nbecome rigid when subjected to sufficiently large deformations. To study this\nstrain-controlled transition, we perform a combination of computational\nmodeling of fibre networks and experiments on networks of type I collagen\nfibers, which are crucial for the integrity of biological tissues. We show\ntheoretically that the development of rigidity is characterized by a\nstrain-controlled continuous phase transition with signatures of criticality.\nOur experiments demonstrate mechanical properties consistent with our model,\nincluding the predicted critical exponents. We show that the nonlinear\nmechanics of collagen networks can be quantitatively captured by the\npredictions of scaling theory for the strain-controlled critical behavior over\na wide range of network concentrations and strains up to failure of the\nmaterial.\n", "  Frequency stability is key to performance of nanoresonators. This stability\nis thought to reach a limit with the resonator's ability to resolve\nthermally-induced vibrations. Although measurements and predictions of\nresonator stability usually disregard fluctuations in the mechanical frequency\nresponse, these fluctuations have recently attracted considerable theoretical\ninterest. However, their existence is very difficult to demonstrate\nexperimentally. Here, through a literature review, we show that all studies of\nfrequency stability report values several orders of magnitude larger than the\nlimit imposed by thermomechanical noise. We studied a monocrystalline silicon\nnanoresonator at room temperature, and found a similar discrepancy. We propose\na new method to show this was due to the presence of frequency fluctuations, of\nunexpected level. The fluctuations were not due to the instrumentation system,\nor to any other of the known sources investigated. These results challenge our\ncurrent understanding of frequency fluctuations and call for a change in\npractices.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effect of <100> uniaxial strain on a\nGe-on-Si laser using deformation potentials. We predict a sudden and dramatic\n~200x threshold reduction upon applying sufficient uniaxial tensile strain to\nthe Ge gain medium. This anomalous reduction is accompanied by an abrupt jump\nin the emission wavelength and is explained by how the light-hole band raises\nrelative to the heavy-hole band due to uniaxial strain. Approximately 3.2%\nuniaxial strain is required to achieve this anomalous threshold reduction for\n1x1019 cm-3 n-type doping, and a complex interaction between uniaxial strain\nand n-type doping is observed. This anomalous threshold reduction represents a\nsubstantial performance advantage for uniaxially strained Ge lasers relative to\nother forms of Ge band engineering such as biaxial strain or tin alloying.\nAchieving this critical combination of uniaxial strain and doping for the\nanomalous threshold reduction is dramatically more relevant to practical\ndevices than realizing a direct band gap.\n", "  We have experimentally measured transport of superfluid, bosonic atoms in a\nmesoscopic system: a small channel connecting two large reservoirs. Starting\nfar from equilibrium (superfluid in a single reservoir), we observe first\nresistive flow transitioning at a critical current into superflow,\ncharacterized by oscillations. We reproduce this full evolution with a simple\nelectronic circuit model. We compare our fitted conductance to two different\nmicroscopic phenomenological models. We also show that the oscillations are\nconsistent with LC oscillations as estimated by the kinetic inductance and\neffective capacitance in our system. Our experiment provides an attractive\nplatform to begin to probe the mesoscopic transport properties of a dilute,\nsuperfluid, Bose gas.\n", "  It is still an open question whether the new scalar particle discovered at\nthe LHC with a mass of 125 GeV is the SM Higgs boson or it belongs to models of\nnew physics with an extended Higgs sector, as the MSSM or 2HDM. The ratio of\nbranching fractions $R$ = BR($H \\to b \\bar b$)/BR($H \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$) of\nHiggs boson decays is a powerful tool in order to distinguish the MSSM Higgs\nsector from the SM or non-supersymmetric 2HDM. This ratio receives large\nrenormalization-scheme independent radiative corrections in supersymmetric\nmodels at large $\\tan\\beta$, which are insensitive to the SUSY mass scale and\nabsent in the SM or 2HDM. Making use of the current LHC data and the upcoming\nnew results on Higgs couplings to be reported by ATLAS and CMS collaborations\nand in a future linear collider, we develop a detailed and updated study of\nthis ratio $R$ which improves previous analyses and sets the level of accuracy\nneeded to discriminate between models.\n", "  We present a digital signal processing system based on a photon counting\napproach which we developed for a thermal neutron detector consisting of\nZnS(Ag):6LiF scintillating layers read out with WLS fibers and SiPMs. Three\ndigital filters have been evaluated: a moving sum, a moving sum after\ndifferentiation and a digital CR-RC^4 filter. The performances of the detector\nwith these filters are presented. A full analog signal processing using a\nCR-RC^4 filter has been emulated digitally. The detector performance obtained\nwith this analog approach is compared with the one obtained with the best\nperforming digital approach.\n", "  We review studies of vibrational energy transfer in a molecular junction\ngeometry, consisting of a molecule bridging two heat reservoirs, solids or\nlarge chemical compounds. This setup is of interest for applications in\nmolecular electronics, thermoelectrics, and nanophononics, and for addressing\nbasic questions in the theory of classical and quantum transport. Calculations\nshow that system size, disorder, structure, dimensionality, internal\nanharmonicities, contact interaction, and quantum coherent effects, are factors\nthat interplay to determine the predominant mechanism (ballistic/diffusive),\neffectiveness (poor/good) and functionality (linear/nonlinear) of thermal\nconduction at the nanoscale. We review recent experiments and relevant\ncalculations of quantum heat transfer in molecular junctions. We recount the\nLandauer approach, appropriate for the study of elastic (harmonic) phononic\ntransport, and outline techniques which incorporate molecular anharmonicities.\nTheoretical methods are described along with examples illustrating the\nchallenge of reaching control over vibrational heat conduction in molecules.\n", "  Ba2ScSbO6 (BSS) has been synthesized in polycrystalline form by solid state\nreaction. Structural characterization of the compound was done through X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) followed by Riedvelt analysis of the XRD pattern. The crystal\nstructure is cubic, space group Fm-3m (No. 225. Optical band-gap of the present\nsystem has been calculated using the UV-Vis Spectroscopy to be 4.2eV. A\ndetailed study of the electronic properties has also been carried out using the\nFull-Potential Linear Augmented Plane Wave (FPLAPW) as implemented in WIEN2k.\nBSS is found to be a large band-gap insulator with potential technological\napplications, such as dielectric resonators and filers in microwave\napplications\n", "  We discuss a quantum mechanical indirect measurement method to recover a\nposition dependent Hamilton matrix from time evolution of coherent quantum\nmechanical states through an object. A mathematical formulation of this inverse\nproblem leads to weighted X-ray transforms where the weight is a matrix. We\nshow that such X-ray transforms are injective with very rough weights.\nConsequently, we can solve our quantum mechanical inverse problem in several\nsettings, but many physically relevant problems we pose also remain open. We\ndiscuss the physical background of the proposed imaging method in detail. We\ngive a rigorous mathematical treatment of a neutrino tomography method that has\nbeen previously described in the physical literature.\n", "  Background: [elided for arXiv character count] Purpose: With the advancement\nof computational power it is now possible to undertake TDHF calculations\nwithout any symmetry assumptions and incorporate the major strides made by the\nnuclear structure community in improving the energy density functionals used in\nthese calculations. In particular, time-odd and tensor terms in these\nfunctionals are naturally present during the dynamical evolution, while being\nabsent or minimally important for most static calculations. The parameters of\nthese terms are determined by the requirement of Galilean invariance or local\ngauge invariance but their significance for the reaction dynamics have not been\nfully studied. This work addresses this question with emphasis on the tensor\nforce. Method: The full version of the Skyrme force, including terms arising\nonly from the Skyrme tensor force, is applied to the study of collisions within\na completely symmetry-unrestricted TDHF implementation. Results: We examine the\neffect on fusion thresholds with and without the tensor force terms and find an\neffect on the fusion threshold energy of the order several MeV. Details of the\ndistribution of the energy within terms in the energy density functional is\nalso discussed. Conclusions: Terms in the energy density functional linked to\nthe tensor force can play a non-negligible role in dynamic processes in nuclei,\nincluding those in which the terms do not affect ground state properties.\n", "  The stability of asymptotic profiles of solutions to the Cauchy-Dirichlet\nproblem for Fast Diffusion Equation (FDE, for short) is discussed. The main\nresult of the present paper is the stability of any asymptotic profiles of\nleast energy. It is noteworthy that this result can cover non-isolated\nprofiles, e.g., those for thin annular domain cases. The method of proof is\nbased on the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality, which is usually used to prove the\nconvergence of solutions to prescribed limits, as well as a uniform extinction\nestimate for solutions to FDE. Besides, local minimizers of an energy\nfunctional associated with this issue are characterized. Furthermore, the\ninstability of positive radial asymptotic profiles in thin annular domains is\nalso proved by applying the Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality in a different way.\n", "  The LHC data have confirmed the Standard Model as the correct theory at the\nelectroweak scale. It successfully explains the experimental results with high\nprecision and all its ingredients, including the Higgs boson, have been finally\nverified. At the same time, the negative searches for signals of new phenomena\nchallenge our previous theoretical wisdom on new-physics scenarios.\n", "  We investigate the potential for enhancing search sensitivity for signals\nhaving charm quarks in the final state, using the sizable bottom-mistagging\nrate for charm quarks at the LHC. Provided that the relevant background\nprocesses contain light quarks instead of charm quarks, the application of\nb-tagging on charm quark-initiated jets enables us to reject more background\nevents than signal ones due to the relatively small mistagging rate for light\nquarks. The basic idea is tested with two rare top decay processes: i) t -> c h\n-> c b bbar and ii) t -> b H+ -> b bbar c where h and H+ denote the Standard\nModel-like higgs boson and a charged higgs boson, respectively. The major\nbackground source is a hadronic top quark decay such as t -> b W+ -> b sbar c.\nWe test our method with Monte Carlo simulation at the LHC 14TeV, and find that\nthe signal-over-background ratio can be increased by a factor of O(6-7) with a\nsuitably designed (heavy) flavor tagging algorithm and scheme.\n", "  We study $SO(32)$ heterotic string theory on torus with magnetic fluxes.\nNon-vanishing fluxes can lead to non-universal gauge kinetic functions for\n$SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1)_Y$ which is the important features of $SO(32)$\nheterotic string theory in contrast to the $E_8\\times E_8$ theory. It is found\nthat the experimental values of gauge couplings are realized with ${\\cal O}(1)$\nvalues of moduli fields based on the realistic models with the $SU(3) \\times\nSU(2) \\times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry and three chiral generations of quarks and\nleptons without chiral exotics.\n", "  The extreme instability and strong chemical activity of carbyne, the infinite\nsp1 hybridized carbon chain, are responsible for its low possibility to survive\nin ambient conditions. Therefore, much less has been possible to explore about\ncarbyne as compared to other novel carbon allotropes such as fullerenes,\nnanotubes and graphene. Although end-capping groups can be used to stabilize\ncarbon chains, length limitation is still a barrier for its actual production,\nand even more for applications. Here, we report a novel route for bulk\nproduction of record long acetylenic linear carbon chains protected by thin\ndouble-walled carbon nanotubes. A corresponding extremely high Raman band is\nthe first proof of a truly bulk yield formation of very long arrangements,\nwhich is unambiguously confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and\nnear-field Raman spectroscopy. Our production establishes a way to\nexceptionally long stable carbon chains including more than 2300 carbon atoms,\nand an elegant forerunner towards the final goal of a bulk production of\nessentially infinite carbyne.\n", "  We study the prediction of the dark matter power spectrum at two-loop order\nin the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures (EFTofLSS) using high\nprecision numerical simulations. In our universe, short distance non-linear\nperturbations, not under perturbative control, affect long distance\nfluctuations through an effective stress tensor that needs to be parametrized\nin terms of counterterms that are functions of the long distance fluctuating\nfields. We find that at two-loop order it is necessary to include three\ncounterterms: a linear term in the over density, $\\delta$, a quadratic term,\n$\\delta^2$, and a higher derivative term, $\\partial^2\\delta$. After the\ninclusion of these three terms, the EFTofLSS at two-loop order matches\nsimulation data up to $k\\simeq 0.34 \\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$, up\nto $k\\simeq 0.55\\,h\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=1$, and up to $k\\simeq 1.1\\,h\\,\n{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=2$. At these wavenumbers, the cosmic variance of the\nsimulation is at least as small as $10^{-3}$, providing a high precision\ncomparison between theory and data. The actual reach of the theory is affected\nby theoretical uncertainties associated to not having included higher order\nterms in perturbation theory, for which we provide an estimate, and by\npotentially overfitting the data, which we also try to address. Since in the\nEFTofLSS the coupling constants associated with the counterterms are unknown\nfunctions of time, we show how a simple parametrization gives a sensible\ndescription of their time-dependence. Overall, the $k$-reach of the EFTofLSS is\nmuch larger than previous analytical techniques, showing that the amount of\ncosmological information amenable to high-precision analytical control might be\nmuch larger than previously believed.\n", "  The Buchdahl limit for static spherically symmetric isotropic stars is\ngeneralised to the case of five dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Our result\ndepends on the sign of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\\alpha$. When\n$\\alpha>0$, we find, unlike in general relativity, that the bound is dependent\non the stellar structure, in particular the central energy density. We find\nthat stable stellar structures can exist arbitrarily close to the event\nhorizon. Thus stable stars can exist with extra mass in this theory compared to\nfive dimensional general relativity. For $\\alpha<0$ it is found that the\nBuchdahl bound is more restrictive than the general relativistic case.\n", "  A general scheme is developed to deal with 1D lattice systems that could be\ntopologically complicated. It is aimed to give a complete study of two coupled\nnormal metal rings. Our method starts with an investigation of the local\nexpressions of the eigenfunctions. By connecting different parts of the system,\nall the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be obtained. It is found that there\nis a possibility for the existence of localized states, which is beyond\nprevious expectations.\n", "  We present an exploratory study that suggests that Efimov physics, a leading\nresearch theme in few-body quantum physics, can also induce stable many-body\nground states whose building blocks are universal clusters. We identify a range\nof parameters in a mass-and-density imbalanced two-species fermionic mixture\nfor which the ground state is a gas of Efimov-related universal trimers. An\nexplicit calculation of the trimer-trimer interaction reveals that the trimer\nphase is an SU$(3)$ Fermi liquid stable against recombination losses. We\npropose to experimentally observe this phase in a fermionic $^6$Li-$^{53}$Cr\nmixture.\n", "  We have studied the magnetotransport through an indium antimonide (InSb)\nnanowire grown in [111] direction, with a geometric constriction and in an\nexternal magnetic field applied along the nanowire axis. We have found that the\nmagnetoresistance is negative for the narrow constriction, nearly zero for the\nconstriction of some intermediate radius, and takes on positive values for the\nconstriction with the radius approaching that of the nanowire. For all\nmagnitudes of the magnetic field, the radius of constriction at which the\nchange of the magnetoresistance sign takes place has been found to be almost\nthe same as long as other geometric parameters of the nanowire are fixed. The\nsign reversing of the magnetoresistance is explained as a combined effect of\ntwo factors: the influence of the constriction on the transverse states and the\nspin Zeeman effect.\n", "  A search for the production of a heavy B quark, having electric charge -1/3\nand vector couplings to W, Z, and H bosons, is carried out using proton-proton\ncollision data recorded at the CERN LHC by the CMS experiment, corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The B quark is assumed to\nbe pair produced and to decay in one of three ways: to tW, bZ, or bH. The\nsearch is carried out in final states with one, two, and more than two charged\nleptons, as well as in fully hadronic final states. Each of the channels in the\nexclusive final-state topologies is designed to be sensitive to specific\ncombinations of the B quark-antiquark pair decays. The observed event yields\nare found to be consistent with the standard model expectations in all the\nfinal states studied. A statistical combination of these results is performed\nand upper limits are set on the cross section of the strongly produced B\nquark-antiquark pairs as a function of the B quark mass. Lower limits on the B\nquark mass between 740 and 900 GeV are set at a 95% confidence level, depending\non the values of the branching fractions of the B quark to tW, bZ, and bH.\nOverall, these limits are the most stringent to date.\n", "  We briefly review the generalized dynamical mean-field theory DMFT+Sigma\ntreatment of both repulsive and attractive disordered Hubbard models. We\nexamine the general problem of metal-insulator transition and the phase diagram\nin repulsive case, as well as BCS-BEC crossover region of attractive model,\ndemonstrating certain universality of single - electron properties under\ndisordering in both models. We also discuss and compare the results for the\ndensity of states and dynamic conductivity in both repulsive and attractive\ncase and the generalized Anderson theorem behavior for superconducting critical\ntemperature in disordered attractive case. A brief discussion of Ginzburg -\nLandau coefficients behavior under disordering in BCS-BEC crossover region is\nalso presented.\n", "  As recently shown, Fermi-LAT measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission\nfrom the Galaxy favor the presence of a smooth softening in the primary\ncosmic-ray spectrum with increasing Galactocentric distance. This result can be\ninterpreted in terms of a spatial-dependent rigidity scaling of the diffusion\ncoefficient. The DRAGON code was used to build a model based on such feature.\nThat scenario correctly reproduces the latest Fermi-LAT results as well as\nlocal cosmic-ray measurements from PAMELA, AMS-02 and CREAM. Here we show that\nthe model, if extrapolated at larger energies, grasps both the gamma-ray flux\nmeasured by MILAGRO at 15 TeV and the H.E.S.S. data from the Galactic ridge,\nassuming that the cosmic-ray spectral hardening found by those experiments at\nabout 250 GeV/n is present in the whole inner Galactic plane region. Moreover,\nwe show as that model also predicts a neutrino emission which may account for a\nsignificant fraction, as well as for the correct spectral shape, of the\nastrophysical flux measured by IceCube above 25 TeV.\n", "  Thermal boundary conditions has played an increasingly important role in\nrevealing the nature of short-range spin glasses and is likely to be relevant\nalso for other disordered systems. Diffusion method initializing each replica\nwith a random boundary condition at the infinite temperature using population\nannealing has been used in recent large-scale simulations. However, the\nefficiency of this method can be greatly suppressed because of temperature\nchaos. For example, most samples have some boundary conditions that are\ncompletely eliminated from the population in the process of annealing at low\ntemperatures. In this work, I study a weighted average method to solve this\nproblem by simulating each boundary conditions separately and collect data\nusing weighted averages. The efficiency of the two methods are studied using\nboth population annealing and parallel tempering, showing that the weighted\naverage method is more efficient and accurate.\n", "  We study generalized diffeomorphisms in exceptional geometry with U-duality\ngroup E_{n(n)} from an algebraic point of view. By extending the Lie algebra\ne_n to an infinite-dimensional Borcherds superalgebra, involving also the\nextension to e_{n+1}, the generalized Lie derivatives can be expressed in a\nsimple way, and the expressions take the same form for any n less than 8. The\nclosure of the transformations then follows from the Jacobi identity and the\ngrading of e_{n+1} with respect to e_n.\n", "  In a bilayered system of particles with wake-mediated interactions, the\naction-reaction symmetry for the effective forces between particles of\ndifferent layers is broken. Under quite general conditions we show that, if the\ninteraction nonreciprocity exceeds a certain threshold, this creates an active\ndispersion of self-propelled clusters of Brownian particles. The emerging\nactivity promotes unusual melting scenarios and an enormous diffusivity in the\ndense fluid. Our results are obtained by computer simulation and analytical\ntheory, and can be verified in experiments with colloidal dispersions and\ncomplex plasmas.\n", "  In this paper, we present charged dilatonic black holes in gravity's rainbow.\nWe study geometric and thermodynamic properties of black hole solutions. We\nalso investigate the effects of rainbow functions on different thermodynamic\nquantities for these charged black holes in dilatonic gravity's rainbow. Then,\nwe demonstrate that first law of thermodynamics is valid for these solutions.\nAfter that, we investigate thermal stability of the solutions using canonical\nensemble and analyze the effects of different rainbow functions on thermal\nstability. In addition, we present some arguments regarding the bound and phase\ntransition points in context of geometrical thermodynamics. We also study the\nphase transition in extended phase space in which cosmological constant is\ntreated as the thermodynamic pressure. Finally, we use another approach to\ncalculate and demonstrate that obtained critical points in extended phase space\nare representing a second order phase transition for these black holes.\n", "  There are two paradigmatic frameworks for treating quantum systems coupled to\na dissipative environment: the Caldeira-Leggett and the\nAmbegaokar-Eckern-Sch\\\"on approaches. Here we recall the differences between\nthem, and explain the consequences when each is applied to a zero dimensional\nspin (possessing an SU(2) symmetry) in a dissipative environment (a dissipative\nquantum dot near or beyond the Stoner instability point).\n", "  The analysis of electromagnetic scattering has long been performed on a\ndiscrete representation of the geometry. This representation is typically\ncontinuous but {\\em not} differentiable. The need to define physical quantities\non this geometric representation has led to development of sets of basis\nfunctions that need to satisfy constraints at the boundaries of the\nelements/tesselations (viz., continuity of normal or tangential components\nacross element boundaries). For electromagnetics, these result in either\ncurl/div-conforming basis sets. The geometric representation used for analysis\nis in stark contrast with that used for design, wherein the surface\nrepresentation is higher order differentiable. Using this representation for\n{\\em both} geometry and physics on geometry has several advantages, and is\neludicated in Hughes et al., Isogeometric analysis: CAD, finite elements,\nNURBS, exact geometry and mesh refinement, Computer Methods in Applied\nMechanics and Engineering 194 (39-41) (2005). Until now, a bulk of the\nliterature on isogeometric methods have been limited to solid mechanics, with\nsome effort to create NURBS based basis functions for electromagnetic analysis.\nIn this paper, we present the first complete isogeometry solution methodology\nfor the electric field integral equation as applied to simply connected\nstructures. This paper systematically proceeds through surface representation\nusing subdivision, definition of vector basis functions on this surface, to\nfidelity in the solution of integral equations. We also present techniques to\nstabilize the solution at low frequencies, and impose a Calder\\'{o}n\npreconditioner. Several results presented serve to validate the proposed\napproach as well as demonstrate some of its capabilities.\n", "  A protocol for transferring an unknown single qubit state has quantum\nfeatures when the average fidelity of the outcomes is greater than 2/3. We use\nthe probabilistic and unambiguous state extraction scheme as a mechanism to\nredistribute the fidelity in the outcome of the teleportation when the process\nis performed with an X-state as a noisy quantum channel. We show that the\nentanglement of the channel is necessary but not sufficient in order for the\ntotal average fidelity f_X to display quantum features, i.e., we find a\nthreshold C_X for the concurrence of the channel. If the mechanism for\nredistributing fidelity is successfully applied then we find a filtrable\noutcome with normalized average fidelity f_{X,USE,0} greater than f_X. In\naddition, we find the threshold concurrence of the channel C_{X,USE,0} in order\nfor the normalized average fidelity to display quantum features. Surprisingly,\nwe find that the threshold concurrence C_{X,USE,0} can be lesser than C_X.\nFinally, we show that if the mechanism for redistributing fidelity fails then\nthe respective filtrable outcome has average fidelity lesser than 2/3.\n", "  Motivated by recent free-standing graphene experiments, we show how thermal\nfluctuations affect the mechanical properties of microscopically thin solid\nribbons. A renormalization group analysis of flexural phonons reveals that\nelongated ribbons behave like highly anisotropic polymers, where the two\ndimensional nature of ribbons is reflected in non-trivial power law scalings of\nthe persistence length and effective bending and twisting rigidities with the\nribbon width. With a coarse-grained transfer matrix approach, we then show how\nthermalized ribbons respond to pulling and bending forces over a wide spectrum\nof temperatures, forces and ribbon lengths.\n", "  It has been clear for past many years that in low energy observables new\nphysics can only appear as a perturbation. Therefore precise theoretical\npredictions and precise experimental measurements have become mandatory. Here\nwe draw attention to the significant advances that have been made on the\nlattice in recent years in $K\\to \\pi \\pi$, $\\Delta M_K$, the long-distance part\nof $\\varepsilon$ and rare K-decays. Thus, in conjunction with experiments, the\nconstruction of a unitarity triangle purely from Kaon physics should soon\nbecome feasible. Along with the B-unitarity triangle, this should allow for\nmore stringent tests of the Standard Model and tighter constraints on new\nphysics.\n", "  Claims that the standard methodology of scientific testing is inapplicable to\nEverettian quantum theory, and hence that the theory is untestable, are due to\nmisconceptions about probability and about the logic of experimental testing.\nRefuting those claims by correcting those misconceptions leads to various\nsimplifications, notably the elimination of everything probabilistic from\nfundamental physics (stochastic processes) and from the methodology of testing\n('Bayesian' credences).\n", "  In a variety of neutron lifetime experiments, in addition to $\\beta-$decay,\nneutrons can be lost by other mechanisms including wall losses. Failure to\naccount for these other loss mechanisms produces systematic measurement error\nand associated systematic uncertainties in neutron lifetime measurements. In\nthis work, we develop a physical model for neutron wall losses and construct a\ncompeting risks survival analysis model to account for losses due to the joint\neffect of $\\beta-$decay losses, wall losses of marginally trapped neutrons, and\nan additional absorption mechanism. We determine the survival probability\nfunction associated with the wall loss mechanism by a Monte Carlo method. Based\non a fit of the competing risks model to a subset of the NIST experimental\ndata, we determine the mean lifetime of trapped neutrons to be approximately\n700 s -- considerably less than the current best estimate of (880.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)\ns promulgated by the Particle Data Group [1]. Currently, experimental studies\nare underway to determine if this discrepancy can be explained by neutron\ncapture by ${}^3$He impurities in the trapping volume. Analysis of the full\nNIST data will be presented in a later publication.\n", "  We have grown the single crystal of PrRhAl$_4$Si$_2$, which crystallizes in\nthe tetragonal crystal structure. From the low temperature physical property\nmeasurements like, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, heat capacity and\nelectrical resistivity, we found that this compound does not show any magnetic\nordering down to 70~mK. Our crystal field calculations on the magnetic\nsusceptibility and specific heat measurements reveal that the 9-fold degenerate\n$(2J+1)$ levels of Pr atom in PrRhAl$_4$Si$_2$, splits into 7 levels, with a\nsinglet ground state and a well separated excited doublet state at 123~K, with\na overall level splitting energy of 320~K.\n", "  We have found that the geometrically frustrated spin chain compound Ca3Co2O6\nbelonging to Ising like universality class with uniaxial anisotropy shows\nkinetic arrest of first order intermediate phase (IP) to ferrimagnetic (FIM)\ntransition. In this system, dc magnetization measurements followed by different\nprotocols suggest the coexistence of high temperature IP with equilibrium FIM\nphase in low temperature. Formation of metastable state due to hindered first\norder transition has also been probed through cooling and heating in unequal\nfield (CHUF) protocol. Kinetically arrested high temperature IP appears to\npersist down to almost the spin freezing temperature in this system.\n", "  This is an extension of estimates of the probability of $\\nu$ to $e$ neutrino\noscillation with one sterile neutrino to three sterile neutrinos, using a 6x6\nmatrix. Since the mixing angle for only one sterile neutrino has been\nexperimentally determined, we estimate the $\\nu$ to $e$ neutrino oscillation\nprobability with different mixing angles for two of the sterile neutrinos.\n", "  The neutral pion photoproduction on the proton near threshold has a very\nsmall scattering cross section when compared to the charged channels, which in\nChPT is explained by strong cancellations between the lowest order pieces.\nTherefore it is very sensitive to higher-order corrections of chiral\nperturbation theory. We perform a fully covariant calculation up to chiral\norder p^3 and we investigate the effect of the inclusion of the Delta(1232)\nresonance as an explicit degree of freedom. We show that the convergence\nimproves, leading to a much better agreement with data at a wide range of\nenergies.\n", "  This mini-review is dedicated to the 85th birthday of Prof. L. V. Keldysh,\nfrom whom we have learned so much. In this paper we study the potential and\nelectron density depth profiles in surface accumulation layers in crystals with\na large and nonlinear dielectric response such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) in the cases\nof planar, spherical and cylindrical geometries. The electron gas can be\ncreated by applying an induction $D_0$ to the STO surface. We describe the\nlattice dielectric response of STO using the Landau-Ginzburg free energy\nexpansion and employ the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation for the electron gas.\nFor the planar geometry we arrive at the electron density profile $n(x) \\propto\n(x+d)^{-12/7}$, where $d \\propto D_0^{-7/5} $. We extend our results to\noverlapping electron gases in GTO/STO/GTO multi-heterojunctions and electron\ngases created by spill-out from NSTO (heavily $n$-type doped STO) layers into\nSTO. Generalization of our approach to a spherical donor cluster creating a big\nTF atom with electrons in STO brings us to the problem of supercharged nuclei.\nIt is known that for an atom with nuclear charge $Ze$, where $Z > 170$,\nelectrons collapse onto the nucleus resulting in a net charge $Z_n < Z$. Here,\ninstead of relativistic physics, the collapse is caused by the nonlinear\ndielectric response. Electrons collapse into the charged spherical donor\ncluster with radius $R$ when its total charge number $Z$ exceeds the critical\nvalue $Z_c \\simeq R/a$, where $a$ is the lattice constant. The net charge\n$eZ_n$ grows with $Z$ until $Z$ exceeds $Z^* \\simeq (R/a)^{9/7}$. After this\npoint, the charge number of the compact core $Z_n$ remains $\\simeq Z^*$, with\nthe rest $Z^*$ electrons forming a sparse Thomas-Fermi electron atmosphere\naround it. We extend our results to the case of long cylindrical clusters as\nwell.\n", "  The knowledge of the nuclear level density is necessary for understanding\nvarious reactions including those in the stellar environment. Usually the\ncombinatorics of Fermi-gas plus pairing is used for finding the level density.\nRecently a practical algorithm avoiding diagonalization of huge matrices was\ndeveloped for calculating the density of many-body nuclear energy levels with\ncertain quantum numbers for a full shell-model Hamiltonian. The underlying\nphysics is that of quantum chaos and intrinsic thermalization in a closed\nsystem of interacting particles. We briefly explain this algorithm and, when\npossible, demonstrate the agreement of the results with those derived from\nexact diagonalization. The resulting level density is much smoother than that\ncoming from the conventional mean-field combinatorics. We study the role of\nvarious components of residual interactions in the process of thermalization,\nstressing the influence of incoherent collision-like processes. The shell-model\nresults for the traditionally used parameters are also compared with standard\nphenomenological approaches.\n", "  Gaplessness was observed in the disordered films of MoC on approaching to the\nsuperconductor to insulator transition by reducing the film thickness. The\ngaplessness is attributed to the enhanced Coulomb interactions due to the loss\nof screening in the presence of strong disorder in the films.\n", "  The coupled-channels method has been a standard tool in analyzing heavy-ion\nfusion reactions at energies around the Coulomb barrier. We investigate three\nsimplifications usually adopted in the coupled-channels calculations. These are\ni) the exclusion of non-collective excitations, ii) the assumption of\ncoordinate independent coupling strengths, and iii) the harmonic oscillator\napproximation for multi-phonon excitations. In connection to the last point, we\npropose a novel microscopic method based on the beyond-mean-field approach in\norder to take into account the anharmonic effects of collective vibrations.\n", "  The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is part of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory and is used to detect the radio emission of cosmic-ray air showers.\nThese observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations of\nthe Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-ray\nenergies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30\nto 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of\nthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is\ndetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated\nusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due\nto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.\nThe spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of\nthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the\nAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air\nshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy\n-- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy\nestimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the\nsurface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator\nscales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent\nemission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% for\nthe data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with at\nleast five radio stations with signal.\n", "  Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a way to characterize the NV\ncenters. Recently, a remarkably sharp dip was observed in the ODMR with a\nhigh-density ensemble of NV centers, and this was reproduced by a theoretical\nmodel in [Zhu et al., Nature Communications 5, 3424 (2014)], showing that the\ndip is a consequence of the spin-1 properties of the NV centers. Here, we\npresent much more details of analysis to show how this model can be applied to\ninvestigate the properties of the NV centers. By using our model, we have\nreproduced the ODMR with and without applied magnetic fields. Also, we\ntheoretically investigate how the ODMR is affected by the typical parameters of\nthe ensemble NV centers such as strain distributions, inhomogeneous magnetic\nfields, and homogeneous broadening width. Our model could provide a way to\nestimate these parameters from the ODMR, which would be crucial to realize\ndiamond-based quantum information processing.\n", "  Unitarity is a fundamental property of any theory required to ensure we work\nin a theoretically consistent framework. In comparison with the quark sector,\nexperimental tests of unitarity for the 3x3 neutrino mixing matrix are\nconsiderably weaker. It must be remembered that the vast majority of our\ninformation on the neutrino mixing angles originates from $\\overline{\\nu}_e$\nand $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance experiments, with the assumption of unitarity being\ninvoked to constrain the remaining elements. New physics can invalidate this\nassumption for the 3x3 subset and thus modify our precision measurements. We\nperform a reanalysis to see how global knowledge is altered when one refits\noscillation results without assuming unitarity, and present $3 \\sigma$ ranges\nfor allowed $U_\\text{PMNS}$ elements consistent with all observed phenomena. We\ncalculate the bounds on the closure of the six neutrino unitarity triangles,\nwith the closure of the $\\nu_e \\nu_\\mu$ triangle being constrained to be $\\leq$\n0.03, while the remaining triangles are significantly less constrained to be\n$\\leq$ 0.1 - 0.2. Similarly for the row and column normalization, we find their\ndeviation from unity is constrained to be $\\leq$ 0.2 - 0.4, for four out of six\nsuch normalisations, while for the $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_e$ row normalisation the\ndeviations are constrained to be $\\leq$ 0.07, all at the $3\\sigma$ CL. We\nemphasise that there is significant room for new low energy physics, especially\nin the $\\nu_\\tau$ sector which very few current experiments constrain directly.\n", "  We study the dynamics of particles in a multi-component 2d Lennard-Jones (LJ)\nfluid in the limiting case where {\\it all the particles are different} (APD).\nThe equilibrium properties of this APD system were studied in our earlier work\n[J.~Chem.~Phys.~142, 051104]. We use molecular dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate the statistical properties of particle trajectories in a\ntemperature range covering both normal and supercooled fluid states. We\ncalculate the mean-square displacement as well as angle, displacement and\nwaiting time distributions, and compare the results with those for\none-component LJ fluid. As temperature is lowered, the dynamics of the APD\nsystem becomes increasingly complex, as the intrinsic difference between the\nparticles is amplified by neighborhood identity ordering and by the\nheterogeneous structure of the supercooled state.\n", "  We investigate a quasi one-dimensional $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ Bose-Einstein\ncondensate in a harmonic trap with an additional dimple trap (dT) in the\ncenter. Within a zero-temperature Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field description we\nprovide a one-dimensional physical intuitive model, which we solve by both a\ntime-independent variational approach and numerical calculations. With this we\nobtain at first equilibrium results for the emerging condensate wave function\nwhich reveal that a dimple trap potential induces a bump or a dip in case of a\nred- or a blue-detuned Gaussian laser beam, respectively. Afterwards, we\ninvestigate how this dT induced bump/dip-imprint upon the condensate wave\nfunction evolves for two quench scenarios. At first we consider the generic\ncase that the harmonic confinement is released. During the resulting\ntime-of-flight expansion it turns out that the dT induced bump in the\ncondensate wave function remains present, whereas the dip starts decaying after\na characteristic time scale which decreases with increasing blue-detuned dT\ndepth. Secondly, once the red- or blue-detuned dT is switched off, we find that\nbright shock-waves or gray/dark bi-soliton trains emerge which oscillate within\nthe harmonic confinement with a characteristic frequency.\n", "  To define a free string by the Nambu-Goto action, all we need is the notion\nof area, and mathematically the area can be defined directly in the absence of\na metric. Motivated by the possibility that string theory admits backgrounds\nwhere the notion of length is not well defined but a definition of area is\ngiven, we study space-time geometries based on the generalization of metric to\narea metric. In analogy with Riemannian geometry, we define the analogues of\nconnections, curvatures and Einstein tensor. We propose a formulation\ngeneralizing Einstein's theory that will be useful if at a certain stage or a\ncertain scale the metric is ill-defined and the space-time is better\ncharacterized by the notion of area. Static spherical solutions are found for\nthe generalized Einstein equation in vacuum, including the Schwarzschild\nsolution as a special case.\n", "  It is commonly assumed in percolation theories that at most one percolating\ncluster can exist in a network. We introduce sausage-like networks (SLNs), an\nensemble of synthetic modular networks in which more than one percolating\ncluster can appear. We show that coexisting percolating clusters (CPCs) emerge\nin such networks due to limited mixing, i.e., a small number of interlinks\nbetween pairs of modules. We develop an approach called modular message passing\n(MMP) to describe and verify these observations. We demonstrate that the\nappearance of CPCs is an important source of inaccuracy in the previously\nintroduced percolation theories, such as the message passing (MP) approach.\nMoreover, we show that the MMP theory improves significantly over the\npredictions of MP for percolation on synthetic networks with limited mixing and\nalso on several real-world networks. These findings have important implications\nfor understanding the robustness of networks and in quantifying epidemic\noutbreaks in the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model of disease spread.\n", "  A new set of nonlinear coupled equations is derived in the context of small\namplitude limit of the general wave equations in a fluid type warm\nelectrons/cold ions plasma irradiated by a continuous laser beam. This limit is\nproved to be integrable by means of the spectral transform theory with singular\ndispersion relation. An exact asymptotic solution is obtained. This model\naccounts for a nonlinear mode coupling of the electrostatic waves with the ion\nsound wave, and is shown to be unstable and does not propagate any stable small\namplitude solution. This instability is understood as a continuous secular\ntransfer of energy from the electrostatic wave to the ion sound wave through\nthe ponderomotive force. The exact mechanism of this transfer is exposed. The\ndynamics of this energy transfer results in a singular asymptotic behavior of\nthe ion sound wave which explains the low penetration of the incident laser\nbeam.\n", "  Fragmentation reactions induced on light and medium nuclei by protons and\nlight nuclei of energies around 1 GeV/nucleon and below are studied with the\nLos Alamos transport code MCNP6 and with its CEM03.03 and LAQGSM03.03 event\ngenerators. CEM and LAQGSM assume that intermediate-energy fragmentation\nreactions on light nuclei occur generally in two stages. The first stage is the\nintranuclear cascade (INC), followed by the second, Fermi breakup\ndisintegration of light excited residual nuclei produced after the INC. CEM and\nLAQGSM account also for coalescence of light fragments (complex particles) up\nto 4He from energetic nucleons emitted during INC. We investigate the validity\nand performance of MCNP6, CEM, and LAQGSM in simulating fragmentation reactions\nat intermediate energies and discuss possible ways of further improving these\ncodes\n", "  The Phase-II upgrade of the ATLAS detector for the High Luminosity Large\nHadron Collider (HL-LHC) includes the replacement of the current Inner Detector\nwith an all-silicon tracker consisting of pixel and strip detectors. The\ncurrent Phase-II detector layout requires the construction of 20,000 strip\ndetector modules consisting of sensor, circuit boards and readout chips, which\nare connected mechanically using adhesives. The adhesive between readout chips\nand circuit board is a silver epoxy glue as was used in the current ATLAS\nSemiConductor Tracker (SCT). This glue has several disadvantages, which\nmotivated the search for an alternative.\n  This paper presents a study concerning the use of six ultra-violet (UV) cure\nglues and a glue pad for use in the assembly of silicon strip detector modules\nfor the ATLAS upgrade. Trials were carried out to determine the ease of use,\nthe thermal conduction and shear strength, thermal cycling, radiation hardness,\ncorrosion resistance and shear strength tests. These investigations led to the\nexclusion of three UV cure glues as well as the glue pad.\n  Three UV cure glues were found to be possible better alternatives. Results\nfrom electrical tests of first prototype modules constructed using these glues\nare presented.\n", "  We develop a quantitative analytic theory that accurately describes the\nodd-even effect observed experimentally in a one-dimensional, trapped Fermi gas\nwith a small number of particles [G. Z\\\"urn et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n175302 (2013)]. We find that the underlying physics is similar to the parity\neffect known to exist in ultrasmall mesoscopic superconducting grains and\natomic nuclei. However, in contrast to superconducting nanograins, the density\n(Hartree) correction dominates over the superconducting pairing fluctuations\nand leads to a much more pronounced odd-even effect in the mesoscopic, trapped\nFermi gas. We calculate the corresponding parity parameter and separation\nenergy using both perturbation theory and a path integral framework in the\nmesoscopic limit, generalized to account for the effects of the trap, pairing\nfluctuations, and Hartree corrections. Our results are in an excellent\nquantitative agreement with experimental data and exact diagonalization.\nFinally, we discuss a few-to-many particle crossover between the perturbative\nmesoscopic regime and non-perturbative many-body physics that the system\napproaches in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  In Type Ia Supernovae (\\sneia), the relative abundances of chemical elements\nare affected by the neutron excess in the composition of the progenitor white\ndwarf. Since these products leave signatures in the spectra near maximum light,\nspectral features may be used to constrain the composition of the progenitor.\nWe calculate the nucleosynthetic yields for three \\snia simulations, assuming\nsingle degenerate, Chandrasekhar mass progenitors, for a wide range of\nprogenitor metallicities, and calculate synthetic light curves and spectra to\nexplore correlations between progenitor metallicity and the strength of\nspectral features. We use two 2D simulations of the\ndeflagration-detonation-transition scenario with different $^{56}$Ni yields and\nthe W7 simulation to control for differences between explosion models and total\nyields. While the overall yields of intermediate mass elements (16 $<$ A $\\leq$\n40) differ between the three cases, trends in the yields are similar. With\nincreasing metallicity, $^{28}$Si yields remain nearly constant, $^{40}$Ca\nyields decline, and Ti and $^{54}$Fe yields increase. In the synthetic spectra,\nwe identify two features at 30 days post explosion that appear to deepen with\nprogenitor metallicity: a Ti feature around 4200\\,\\AA\\ and a Fe feature around\n5200\\,\\AA\\@. In all three simulations, their pseudo equivalent widths show a\nsystematic trend with progenitor metallicity. This suggests that these two\nfeatures may allow differentiation among progenitor metallicities of observed\n\\sneia and potentially help reduce the intrinsic Hubble scatter.\n", "  Using the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics ({\\tt UrQMD}) model,\nwe investigate the azimuthal correlations in p--Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=5.02$ TeV. It is shown that the simulated hadronic p--Pb\nsystem can not generate the collective flow signatures, but mainly behaves as a\nnon-flow dominant system. However, the characteristic $v_{2}(p_{\\rm T})$\nmass-ordering of pions, kaons and protons is observed in {\\tt UrQMD}\nsimulations, which is the consequence of hadronic interactions and not\nnecessarily associated with strong fluid-like expansions.\n", "  Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) are among the very few candidates for\nsingle-photon sources operating in the telecom bands since they exhibit large\nphoton antibunching up to room temperature. However, coupling a nanotube to a\nphotonic structure is highly challenging because of the random location and\nemission wavelength in the growth process. Here, we demonstrate the realization\nof a widely tunable single-photon source by using a carbon nanotube inserted in\nan original repositionable fiber micro-cavity : we fully characterize the\nemitter in the free-space and subsequently form the cavity around the nanotube.\nThis brings an invaluable insight into the emergence of quantum\nelectrodynamical effects. We observe an efficient funneling of the emission\ninto the cavity mode with a strong sub-Poissonian statistics together with an\nup to 6-fold Purcell enhancement factor. By exploiting the cavity feeding\neffect on the phonon wings, we locked the single-photon emission at the cavity\nfrequency over a 4~THz-wide band while keeping the mode width below 80~GHz.\nThis paves the way to multiplexing and multiple qubit coupling.\n", "  One of the future goals of the LHC is to precisely measure the properties of\nHiggs boson. The associated production of Higgs boson and the top quark pair is\na promising process to investigate the related Yukawa interaction and the\nproperties of Higgs. Compared with the pure scalar sector in the Standard\nModel, the Higgs sector contains both scalar and pseudoscalar in many new\nphysics models, which makes the $t\\bar t H$ interaction more complex and\nprovides a variety of phenomena. To investigate the $t\\bar t H$ interaction and\nthe properties of Higgs, we study the top quark spin correlation observables at\nthe LHC.\n", "  We extend a global uniqueness result for the Calder\\'on problem with partial\ndata, due to Kenig-Sj\\\"ostrand-Uhlmann, to the case of less regular\nconductivities. Specifically, we show that in dimensions $n\\ge 3$, the\nknowledge of the Diricihlet-to-Neumann map, measured on possibly very small\nsubsets of the boundary, determines uniquely a conductivity having essentially\n$3/2$ derivatives in an $L^2$ sense.\n", "  Based on first-principles calculations, we predict a substantial increase in\nthe optical dielectric function of LiAsSe$_2$ under pressure. We find that the\noptical dielectric constant is enhanced threefold under volume compression.\nThis enhancement is mainly due to the dimerization strength reduction of the\none-dimensional (1D) As--Se chains in LiAsSe$_2$, which significantly alters\nthe wavefunction phase mismatch between two neighboring chains and changes the\ntransition intensity. By developing a tight-binding model of the interacting 1D\nchains, the essential features of the low-energy electronic structure of\nLiAsSe$_2$ are captured. Our findings are important for understanding the\nfundamental physics of LiAsSe$_2$ and provide a feasible way to enhance the\nmaterial optical response that can be applied to light harvesting for energy\napplications.\n", "  We consider the effect of an energy-dependent dipole form factor in the\nhigh-energy behavior of the forward amplitude. The connection between the\nsemihard parton-level dynamics and the hadron-hadron scattering is established\nby an eikonal QCD-based model. Our results for the proton-proton ($pp$) and\nantiproton-proton ($\\bar{p}p$) total cross sections,\n$\\sigma_{tot}^{pp,\\bar{p}p}(s)$, obtained using the CTEQ6L1 parton distribution\nfunction, are consistent with the recent data from the TOTEM experiment.\n", "  A principally novel approach towards solving the few-particle\n(many-dimensional) quantum scattering problems is described. The approach is\nbased on a complete discretization of few-particle continuum and usage of\nmassively parallel computations of integral kernels for scattering equations by\nmeans of GPU. The discretization for continuous spectrum of a few-particle\nHamiltonian is realized with a projection of all scattering operators and wave\nfunctions onto the stationary wave-packet basis. Such projection procedure\nleads to a replacement of singular multidimensional integral equations with\nlinear matrix ones having finite matrix elements. Different aspects of the\nemployment of a multithread GPU computing for fast calculation of the matrix\nkernel of the equation are studied in detail. As a result, the fully realistic\nthree-body scattering problem above the break-up threshold is solved on an\nordinary desktop PC with GPU for a rather small computational time.\n", "  The exact Lyapunov dimension formula for the Lorenz system has been\nanalytically obtained first due to G.A.Leonov in 2002 under certain\nrestrictions on parameters, permitting classical values. He used the\nconstruction technique of special Lyapunov-type functions developed by him in\n1991 year. Later it was shown that the consideration of larger class of\nLyapunov-type functions permits proving the validity of this formula for all\nparameters of the system such that all the equilibria of the system are\nhyperbolically unstable. In the present work it is proved the validity of the\nformula for Lyapunov dimension for a wider variety of parameters values, which\ninclude all parameters satisfying the classical physical limitations. One of\nthe motivation of this work is the possibility of computing a chaotic attractor\nin the Lorenz system in the case of one unstable and two stable equilibria.\n", "  The remarkable electronic properties of graphene have fueled the vision of a\ngraphene-based platform for lighter, faster and smarter electronics and\ncomputing applications. One of the challenges is to devise ways to tailor its\nelectronic properties and to control its charge carriers. Here we show that a\nsingle atom vacancy in graphene can stably host a local charge and that this\ncharge can be gradually built up by applying voltage pulses with the tip of a\nscanning tunneling microscope (STM). The response of the conduction electrons\nin graphene to the local charge is monitored with scanning tunneling and Landau\nlevel spectroscopy, and compared to numerical simulations. As the charge is\nincreased, its interaction with the conduction electrons undergoes a transition\ninto a supercritical regime 6-11 where itinerant electrons are trapped in a\nsequence of quasi-bound states which resemble an artificial atom. The\nquasi-bound electron states are detected by a strong enhancement of the density\nof states (DOS) within a disc centered on the vacancy site which is surrounded\nby halo of hole states. We further show that the quasi-bound states at the\nvacancy site are gate tunable and that the trapping mechanism can be turned on\nand off, providing a new mechanism to control and guide electrons in graphene\n", "  Based on chiral unitary approach, we construct the realistic KbarN local\npotential, which is useful for the quantitative calculation of Kbar-nuclei.\nSince the resonance pole structure of the KbarN system seems important for the\nKbar-nuclei and the spacial structure of Lambda(1405), we establish the\nconstruction procedure of the local potential paying attention to the\nscattering amplitude in the complex energy plane. Furthermore, for the\nquantitative study of the Kbar-nuclei, we consider the constraint from the\nrecent experimental data measured by SIDDHARTA, which significantly reduces the\nuncertainty of the KbarN amplitude. With this new local potential, we estimate\nthe spacial structure of Lambda(1405) and obtain the result indicating the\nmeson-baryon molecular state of Lambda(1405).\n", "  The contributions to the electron-electron-photon vertex of two-loop\nelectroweak corrections are calculated. The relative correction to the\nparity-violating asymmetry of M{\\o}ller scattering for the case of 11 GeV\nelectron scattered off the electron at rest is found to be about -0.0034 and\nshould be taken into account at future experiment MOLLER at JLab.\n", "  We study a harmonic system coupled to chain of first neighbor interacting\noscillators. After deriving the exact dynamics of the system, we prove that one\ncan effectively describe the exact dynamics by considering a suitable shorter\nchain. We provide the explicit expression for such an effective dynamics and we\nprovide an upper bound on the error one makes considering it instead of the\ndynamics of the full chain. We eventually prove how error, timescale and number\nof modes in the truncated chain are related.\n", "  The formation of 360{\\deg} magnetic domain walls (360DWs) in Co and Ni80Fe20\nthin film wires was demonstrated experimentally for different wire widths, by\nsuccessively injecting two 180{\\deg} domain walls (180DWs) into the wire. For\nnarrow wires (less than 50 nm wide for Co), edge roughness prevented the\ncombination of the 180DWs into a 360DW, and for wide wires (200 nm for Co) the\n360DW collapsed, but over an intermediate range of wire widths, reproducible\n360DW formation occurred. The annihilation and dissociation of 360DWs was\ndemonstrated by applying a magnetic field parallel to the wire, showing that\nannihilation fields were several times higher than dissociation fields in\nagreement with micromagnetic modeling. The annihilation of a 360DW by current\npulsing was demonstrated.\n", "  As Arctic sea ice extent decreases with increasing greenhouse gases, there is\na growing interest in whether there could be a bifurcation associated with its\nloss, and whether there is significant hysteresis associated with that\nbifurcation. A challenge in answering this question is that the bifurcation\nbehavior of certain Arctic energy balance models have been shown to be\nsensitive to how ice-albedo feedback is parameterized. We analyze an Arctic\nenergy balance model in the limit as a smoothing parameter associated with\nice-albedo feedback tends to zero, which introduces a discontinuity boundary to\nthe dynamical systems model. Our analysis provides a case study where we use\nthe system in this limit to guide the investigation of bifurcation behavior of\nthe original albedo-smoothed system. In this case study, we demonstrate that\ncertain qualitative bifurcation behaviors of the albedo-smoothed system can\nhave counterparts in the limit with no albedo smoothing. We use this\nperspective to systematically explore the parameter space of the model. For\nexample, we uncover parameter sets for which the largest transition, with\nincreasing greenhouse gases, is from a perennially ice-covered Arctic to a\nseasonally ice-free state, an unusual bifurcation scenario that persists even\nwhen albedo-smoothing is reintroduced. This analysis provides an alternative\nperspective on how parameters of the model affect bifurcation behavior. We\nexpect our approach, which exploits the width of repelling sliding intervals\nfor understanding the hysteresis loops, would carry over to other positive\nfeedback systems with a similar natural piecewise-smooth limit, and when the\nfeedback strength is likewise modulated with seasons or other periodic forcing.\n", "  An effective Hamiltonian describing the surface states of a toroidal\ntopological insulator is obtained, and it is shown to support both bound-states\nand charged zero-modes. Actually, the spin connection induced by the toroidal\ncurvature can be viewed as an position-dependent effective vector potential,\nwhich ultimately yields the zero-modes whose wave-functions harmonically\noscillate around the toroidal surface. In addition, two distinct Berry phases\nare predicted to take place by the virtue of the toroidal topology.\n", "  We study scalar perturbations of nonlinear charged Lifshitz black branes with\nhyperscaling violating factor, and we find numerically the quasinormal modes\nfor scalar fields. Then, we study the stability of these black branes under\nmassive and massless scalar field perturbations. Also, we consider different\nvalues of the dynamical exponent, the nonlinear exponent and the hyperscaling\nviolating exponent.\n", "  Modeling phenomena from experimental data, always begin with a \\emph{choice\nof hypothesis} on the observed dynamics such as \\emph{determinism},\n\\emph{randomness}, \\emph{derivability} etc. Depending on these choices,\ndifferent behaviors can be observed. The natural question associated to the\nmodeling problem is the following : \\emph{\"With a finite set of data concerning\na phenomenon, can we recover its underlying nature ?} From this problem, we\nintroduce in this paper the definition of \\emph{multi-scale functions},\n\\emph{scale calculus} and \\emph{scale dynamics} based on the \\emph{time-scale\ncalculus} (see \\cite{bohn}). These definitions will be illustrated on the\n\\emph{multi-scale Okamoto's functions}. The introduced formalism explains why\nthere exists different continuous models associated to an equation with\ndifferent \\emph{scale regimes} whereas the equation is \\emph{scale invariant}.\nA typical example of such an equation, is the \\emph{Euler-Lagrange equation}\nand particularly the \\emph{Newton's equation} which will be discussed. Notably,\nwe obtain a \\emph{non-linear diffusion equation} via the \\emph{scale Newton's\nequation} and also the \\emph{non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation} via the\n\\emph{scale Newton's equation}. Under special assumptions, we recover the\nclassical \\emph{diffusion} equation and the \\emph{Schr\\\"odinger equation}.\n", "  We report a measurement of the amplitude ratio $r_S$ of $B^0 \\to D^0K^{*0}$\nand $B^0 \\to \\bar{D^0}K^{*0}$ decays with a Dalitz analysis of $D\\to\nK_S^0\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays, for the first time using a model-independent method.\nWe set an upper limit $r_S < 0.87$ at the 68\\% confidence level, using the full\ndata sample of $772\\times10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$\nresonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. This result is\nobtained from observables $x_- = +0.4 ^{+1.0 +0.0}_{-0.6 -0.1} \\pm0.0$, $y_- =\n-0.6 ^{+0.8 +0.1}_{-1.0 -0.0} \\pm0.1$, $x_+ = +0.1 ^{+0.7 +0.0}_{-0.4 -0.1}\n\\pm0.1$ and $y_+ = +0.3 ^{+0.5 +0.0}_{-0.8 -0.1} \\pm0.1$, where $x_\\pm = r_S\n\\cos(\\delta_S \\pm \\phi_3)$, $y_\\pm = r_S \\sin(\\delta_S \\pm \\phi_3)$ and\n$\\phi_3~(\\delta_S)$ is the weak (strong) phase difference between $B^0 \\to\nD^0K^{*0}$ and $B^0 \\to \\bar{D^0}K^{*0}$.\n", "  We study three different random walk models on several two-dimensional\nlattices by Monte Carlo simulations. One is the usual nearest neighbor random\nwalk. Another is the nearest neighbor random walk which is not allowed to\nbacktrack. The final model is the smart kinetic walk. For all three of these\nmodels the distribution of the point where the walk exits a simply connected\ndomain $D$ in the plane converges weakly to harmonic measure on $\\partial D$ as\nthe lattice spacing $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. Let $\\omega(0,|dz|;D)$ be harmonic\nmeasure for $D$, and let $\\omega_\\delta(0,|dz|;D)$ be the discrete harmonic\nmeasure for one of the random walk models. Our definition of the random walk\nmodels is unusual in that we average over the orientation of the lattice with\nrespect to the domain. We are interested in the limit of\n$(\\omega_\\delta(0,|dz|;D)- \\omega(0,|dz|;D))/\\delta$. Our Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the three models lead to the conjecture that this limit equals\n$c_{M,L} \\, \\rho_D(z) |dz|$, where the function $\\rho_D(z)$ depends on the\ndomain, but not on the model or lattice, and the constant $c_{M,L}$ depends on\nthe model and on the lattice, but not on the domain. So there is a form of\nuniversality for this first order correction. We also give an explicit formula\nfor the conjectured density $\\rho_D$.\n", "  By means of the asynchronous cellular automata algorithm we study stationary\nstates and spatial patterning in an $SIS$ model, in which the individuals' are\nattached to the vertices of a graph and their mobility is mimicked by varying\nthe neighbourhood size $q$. The versions with fixed $q$ and those taken at\nrandom at each step and for each individual are studied. Numerical data on the\nlocal behaviour of the model are mapped onto the solution of its zero\ndimensional version, corresponding to the limit $q\\to +\\infty$ and equivalent\nto the logistic growth model. This allows for deducing an explicit form of the\ndependence of the fraction of infected individuals on the curing rate $\\gamma$.\nA detailed analysis of the appearance of spatial patterns of infected\nindividuals in the stationary state is performed.\n", "  A frequentist asymptotic expansion method for error estimation is employed\nfor a network of gravitational wave detectors to assess the amount of\ninformation that can be extracted from gravitational wave observations.\nMathematically we derive lower bounds in the errors that any parameter\nestimator will have in the absence of prior knowledge to distinguish between\nthe post-Einsteinian (ppE) description of coalescing binary systems and that of\ngeneral relativity. When such errors are smaller than the parameter value,\nthere is possibility to detect these violations from GR. A parameter space with\ninclusion of dominant dephasing ppE parameters $(\\beta, b)$ is used for a study\nof first- and second-order (co)variance expansions, focusing on the inspiral\nstage of a nonspinning binary system of zero eccentricity detectible through\nAdv. LIGO and Adv. Virgo. Our procedure is an improvement of the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao\nLower Bound. When Bayesian errors are lower than our bound it means that they\ndepend critically on the priors. The analysis indicates the possibility of\nconstraining deviations from GR in inspiral SNR ($\\rho \\sim 15-17$) regimes\nthat are achievable in upcoming scientific runs (GW150914 had an inspiral SNR\n$\\sim 12$). The errors on $\\beta$ also increase errors of other parameters such\nas the chirp mass $\\mathcal{M}$ and symmetric mass ratio $\\eta$. Application is\ndone to existing alternative theories of gravity, which include modified\ndispersion relation of the waveform, non-spinning models of quadratic modified\ngravity, and dipole gravitational radiation (i.e., Brans-Dicke type)\nmodifications.\n", "  Spatial resolution of less than 200 um is challenging for thermal neutron\ndetection. A novel readout scheme based on the time-projection-chamber (TPC)\nconcept is used in a gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) detector. Thermal\nneutrons are captured in a single 2 um thick Boron-10 converter cathode and\nsecondary Helium and Lithium ions are produced with a combined energy of 2.8\nMeV. These ions have sufficient energy to form straight tracks of several mm\nlength. With a time resolving 2-dimensional readout of 400 um pitch in both\ndirections, based on APV25 chips, the ions are tracked and their respective\norigin in the cathode converter foil is reconstructed. Using an Ar-CO2 93:7%\ngas mixture, a resolution of 100 um (FWHM 235 um) has been observed with a\ntriple GEM-detector setup at the Garching neutron source (FRMII) for neutrons\nof 4.7 Angstrom.\n", "  An equation of state of cold nuclear matter with an arbitrary isotopic\ncomposition is studied within a relativistic mean-field approach with hadron\nmasses and coupling constants depending self-consistently on the scalar\nmean-field. All hadron masses decrease universally with the scalar field\ngrowth, whereas meson-nucleon coupling constants can vary differently. More\nspecifically we focus on two modifications of the KVOR model studied\npreviously. One extension of the model (KVORcut) demonstrates that the equation\nof state stiffens if the increase of the scalar-field magnitude with the\ndensity is bounded from above at some value for baryon densities above the\nsaturation nuclear density. This can be realized if the nucleon vector-meson\ncoupling constant changes rapidly as a function of the scalar field slightly\nabove the desired value. The other version of the model (MKVOR) utilizes a\nsmaller value of the nucleon effective mass at the nuclear saturation density\nand a saturation of the scalar field in the isospin asymmetric matter induced\nby a strong variation of the nucleon isovector-meson coupling constant as\nfunction of the scalar field. A possibility of hyperonization of the matter in\nneutron star interiors is incorporated. Our equations of state fulfill majority\nof known empirical constraints including the pressure-density constraint from\nheavy-ion collisions, direct Urca constraint, gravitational-baryon mass\nconstraint for the pulsar J0737-3039B, and the constraint on the maximum mass\nof the neutron stars.\n", "  The stannide family of materials A3T4Sn13 (A = La,Sr,Ca, T = Ir,Rh) is\ninteresting due to the interplay between a tunable lattice instability and\nphonon-mediated superconductivity with Tc ~ 5-7 K. In Sr3Ir4Sn13 a structural\ntransition temperature T* ~ 147 K associated with this instability has been\nreported, which is believed to result from a superlattice distortion of the\nhigh temperature phase on cooling. Here we report the first experimental study\nof the electronic structure of a member of this material family - Sr3Ir4Sn13\nthrough measurements of quantum oscillations and comparison with density\nfunctional theory calculations. Our measurements reveal good agreement with\ntheory using the lattice parameters consistent with a body-centred cubic\nlattice of symmetry I-43d of the low temperature phase. The study of the\nfermiology of Sr3Ir4Sn13 we present here should help inform models of multiband\nsuperconductivity in the superconducting stannides.\n", "  We describe the implementation of Quantum Electrodynamic (QED) evolution at\nLeading Order (LO) along with Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) evolution at\nNext-to-Leading Order (NLO) in the CTEQ-TEA Global analysis package. The\ninelastic contribution to the photon Parton Distribution Function (PDF) is\ndescribed by a two-parameter ansatz, coming from radiation off the valence\nquarks, and based on the CT14 NLO PDFs. Setting the two parameters to be equal\nallows us to completely specify the inelastic photon PDF in terms of the\ninelastic momentum fraction carried by the photon, $p_0^\\gamma$, at the initial\nscale $Q_0=1.295$ GeV. We obtain constraints on the photon PDF by comparing\nwith ZEUS data~\\cite{Chekanov:2009dq} on the production of isolated photons in\ndeep inelastic scattering, $ep\\rightarrow e\\gamma+X$. For this comparison we\npresent a new perturbative calculation of the process that consistently\ncombines the photon-initiated contribution with the quark-initiated\ncontribution. Comparison with the data allows us to put a constraint at the\n90\\% confidence level of $p_0^\\gamma\\lesssim0.14\\%$ for the inelastic photon\nPDF at the initial scale of $Q_0=1.295$ GeV in the one-parameter radiative\nansatz. The resulting inelastic CT14QED PDFs will be made available to the\npublic. In addition, we also provide CT14QEDinc PDFs, in which the {\\em\ninclusive} photon PDF at the scale $Q_0$ is defined by the sum of the inelastic\nphoton PDF and the elastic photon distribution obtained from the Equivalent\nPhoton Approximation.\n", "  These lectures explain that comparisons between experiment and theory can\nexpose the impact of running couplings and masses on hadron observables and\nthereby aid materially in charting the momentum dependence of the interaction\nthat underlies strong-interaction dynamics. The series begins with a primer on\ncontinuum QCD, which introduces some of the basic ideas necessary in order to\nunderstand the use of Schwinger functions as a nonperturbative tool in hadron\nphysics. It continues with a discussion of confinement and dynamical symmetry\nbreaking (DCSB) in the Standard Model, and the impact of these phenomena on our\nunderstanding of condensates, the parton structure of hadrons, and the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor. The final lecture treats the problem of grand\nunification; namely, the contemporary use of Schwinger functions as a\nsymmetry-preserving tool for the unified explanation and prediction of the\nproperties of both mesons and baryons. It reveals that DCSB drives the\nformation of diquark clusters in baryons and sketches a picture of baryons as\nbound-states with Borromean character. Planned experiments are capable of\nvalidating the perspectives outlined in these lectures.\n", "  We study sterile neutrinos in an extension of the standard model, based on\nthe gauge group $SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(3)_L\\otimes SU(3)_R\\otimes U(1)_N$, and use\nthis model to illustrate how to apply cosmological limits to thermalized\nparticles that decouple while relativistic. These neutrinos, $N_{aL}$, can be\ndark matter candidates, with a keV mass range arising rather naturally in this\nmodel. We analyse the cosmological limits imposed by $N_{eff}$ and dark matter\nabundance on these neutrinos. Assuming that these neutrinos have roughly equal\nmasses and are not CDM, we conclude that the $N_{eff}$ experimental value can\nbe satisfied in some cases and the abundance constraint implies that these\nneutrinos are hot dark matter. With this information, we give upper bounds on\nthe Yukawa coupling between the sterile neutrinos and a scalar field, the\npossible values of the VEV of this scalar field and lower bounds to the mass of\none gauge boson of the model.\n", "  We describe in this paper the observables of inflationary models, in\nparticular the spectrum index of torsion scalar perturbations, the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, and the running of the spectral index, in the framework\nof perfect fluid models and F(T) gravity theories through the reconstruction\nmethods. Then, our results on the perfect fluid and F(T) gravity theories of\ninflation are compared with recent cosmological observations such as the Planck\nsatellite and BICEP2 experiment. Ours studies prove that the perfect fluid and\nF(T) gravity models can reproduce the inflationary universe consistent above\nall with the Planck data. We have reconstructed several models and considered\nothers which give the best fit values compatible with the spectral index of\ncurvature perturbations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the running of the\nspectral index within the allowed ranges suggested by the Planck and BICEP2\nresults.\n", "  We consider non-equilibrium relaxation of electrons due to their coupling\nwith phonons in a simple metal. In our model electrons are living at a higher\ntemperature than that of the phonon bath, mimicking a non-equilibrium steady\nstate situation. We study the relaxation of such hot electrons proposing a\nsuitable generalization of the memory function formalism formulated by G\\\"otze\nand W\\\"olfle[Phys. Rev. B 6, 1226 (1972)]. We derive analytical expressions for\nboth dc and optical scattering rates in various temperature and frequency\nregimes. Limiting cases are in accord with the previous studies. An interesting\nfeature, that the dc scattering rate at high temperatures and optical\nscattering rate at high frequencies, are independent of the temperature\ndifference between the electrons and the phonons is found in this study. The\npresent formalism forms a basis which can also be extended to study\nhot-electron relaxation in more complex situations\n", "  The lattice properties at low temperatures of two samples of NdFeAsO1-xFx\n(x=0.05 and 0.25) have been examined in order to investigate possible\nstructural phase transition that may occur in the optimally doped\nsuperconducting sample with respect to the non-superconducting low-F\nconcentration compound. In order to detect small modifications in the ion\ndisplacements with temperature micro-Raman and high resolution synchrotron\npowder diffraction measurements were carried out. No increase of the width of\nthe (220) or (322) tetragonal diffraction peaks and microstrains could be found\nin the superconducting sample from synchrotron XRD measurements. On the other\nhand, the atomic displacement parameters deviate from the expected behavior, in\nagreement with modifications in the phonon width, as obtained by Raman\nscattering. These deviations occur around 150 K for both F dopings, with\ndistinct differences among the two compounds, i.e., they decrease at low doping\nand increase for the superconducting sample. The data do not support a hidden\nphase transition to an orthorhombic phase in the superconducting compound, but\npoint to an isostructural lattice deformation. Based on the absence of magnetic\neffects in this temperature range for the superconducting sample, we attribute\nthe observed lattice anomalies to the formation of local lattice distortions\nthat, being screened by the carriers, can only acquire long-range coherence by\nmeans of a structural phase transition at low doping levels.\n", "  We demonstrate that a phonon stopband can be synthesized from an aperiodic\nstructure comprising a discrete set of phononic filter stages. Each element of\nthe set has a dispersion relation that defines a complete bandgap when\ncalculated under a Bloch boundary condition. Hence, the effective stopband\nwidth in an aperiodic phononic filter (PnF) may readily exceed that of a\nphononic crystal with a single lattice constant or a coherence scale. With\nsimulations of multi-moded phononic waveguides, we discuss the effects of\nfinite geometry and mode-converting junctions on the phonon transmission in\nPnFs. The principles described may be utilized to form a wide stopband in\nacoustic and surface wave media. Relative to the quantum of thermal conductance\nfor a uniform mesoscopic beam, a PnF with a stopband covering 1.6-10.4 GHz is\nestimated to reduce the thermal conductance by an order of magnitude at 75mK.\n", "  We present preliminary results on the measurement of the I=1/2 $K \\pi$\n$\\mathcal{S}$-wave through a model independent partial wave analysis of\n$\\eta_c$ decays to $K^0_S K^+ \\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^- \\pi^0$ produced in two-photon\ninteractions. We also perform a Dalitz plot analysis of the $J/\\psi$ decays to\n$\\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$ and $K^+ K^- \\pi^0$ produced by the initial state radiation\nprocess.\n", "  The properties of quantum information in space-time can be investigated by\nstudying operational tasks. In one such task, summoning, an unknown quantum\nstate is supplied at one point, and a call is made at another for it to be\nreturned at a third. Hayden-May recently proved necessary and sufficient\nconditions for guaranteeing successful return of a summoned state for finite\nsets of call and return points when there is a guarantee of at most one\nsummons. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions when there may be several\npossible summonses and complying with any one constitutes success. We show\nthere is a \"quantum paradox of choice\" in summoning: the extra freedom in\ncompleting the task makes it strictly harder. This intriguing result has\npractical applications for distributed quantum computing and cryptography and\nalso implications for our understanding of relativistic quantum information and\nits localization in space-time.\n", "  We study discrete quantum dynamics where single evolution step consists of\nunitary system transformation followed by decoherence via coupling to an\nenvironment. Often non-Markovian memory effects are attributed to structured\nenvironments whereas here we take a more general approach within discrete\nsetting. In addition of controlling the structure of the environment, we are\ninterested in how local unitaries on the open system allow the appearance and\ncontrol of memory effects. Our first simple qubit model, where local unitary is\nfollowed by dephasing, illustrates how memory effects arise despite of having\nno-structure in the environment the system is coupled with. We then elaborate\nthis observation by constructing a model for open quantum walk where the\nunitary coin and transfer operation is augmented with dephasing of the coin.\nThe results demonstrate that in the limit of strong dephasing within each\nevolution step, the combined coin-position open system always displays memory\neffects and their quantity is independent of the structure of the environment.\nOur construction makes possible an experimentally realizable open quantum walk\nwith photons exhibiting non-Markovian features.\n", "  We present here a compact and self-contained review of recently developed\nKeldysh formalism for multiple parallel worlds. The formalism has been applied\nto consistent quantum evaluation of the flows of informational quantities, in\nparticular, to evaluation of Renyi and Shannon entropy flows. We start with the\nformulation of standard and extended Keldysh technique in single world in a\nform convenient for our presentation. We explain the use of Keldysh contours\nencompassing multiple parallel worlds In the end, we shortly summarize the\nconcrete results obtained with the method.\n", "  We design and implement HPMC, a scalable hard particle Monte Carlo simulation\ntoolkit, and release it open source as part of HOOMD-blue. HPMC runs in\nparallel on many CPUs and many GPUs using domain decomposition. We employ BVH\ntrees instead of cell lists on the CPU for fast performance, especially with\nlarge particle size disparity, and optimize inner loops with SIMD vector\nintrinsics on the CPU. Our GPU kernel proposes many trial moves in parallel on\na checkerboard and uses a block-level queue to redistribute work among threads\nand avoid divergence. HPMC supports a wide variety of shape classes, including\nspheres / disks, unions of spheres, convex polygons, convex spheropolygons,\nconcave polygons, ellipsoids / ellipses, convex polyhedra, convex\nspheropolyhedra, spheres cut by planes, and concave polyhedra. NVT and NPT\nensembles can be run in 2D or 3D triclinic boxes. Additional integration\nschemes permit Frenkel-Ladd free energy computations and implicit depletant\nsimulations. In a benchmark system of a fluid of 4096 pentagons, HPMC performs\n10 million sweeps in 10 minutes on 96 CPU cores on XSEDE Comet. The same\nsimulation would take 7.6 hours in serial. HPMC also scales to large system\nsizes, and the same benchmark with 16.8 million particles runs in 1.4 hours on\n2048 GPUs on OLCF Titan.\n", "  We have developed an event generator for direct-photon production in hadron\ncollisions, including associated two-jet production in the framework of the\nGR@PPA event generator. The event generator consistently combines $\\gamma$ +\n2-jet production processes with the lowest-order $\\gamma$ + jet and\nphoton-radiation (fragmentation) processes from QCD 2-jet production using a\nsubtraction method. The generated events can be fed to general-purpose event\ngenerators to facilitate the addition of hadronization and decay simulations.\nUsing the obtained event information, we can simulate photon isolation and\nhadron-jet reconstruction at the particle (hadron) level. The simulation\nreasonably reproduces measurement data obtained at the LHC concerning not only\nthe inclusive photon spectrum, but also the correlation between the photon and\njet. The simulation implies that the contribution of the $\\gamma$ + 2-jet is\nvery large, especially in low photon-$p_{T}$ ($\\lesssim$ 50 GeV) regions.\nDiscrepancies observed at low $p_{T}$, although marginal, may indicate the\nnecessity for the consideration of further higher-order processes. Unambiguous\nparticle-level definition of the photon-isolation condition for the signal\nevents is desired to be given explicitly in future measurements.\n", "  We present theoretical predictions for the nuclear-induced attenuation of the\ndifferential cross sections for inclusive and tagged b-jet production in heavy\nion collisions at the LHC. We find that for inclusive b-jet production at high\ntransverse momentum the mass effects are negligible, and that the attenuation\nis comparable to the one observed for light jets. On the other hand, for\nisolated-photon and B-meson-tagged b-jets the sample of events with heavy\nquarks produced at the early stages of the collision is greatly enhanced. Thus,\nthese tagged b-jet final-states have a much more direct connection to the\nphysics of b-quark energy loss. We present theoretical predictions for the\nquenching of such tagged b-jet events at the LHC and the QGP-induced\nmodification of the related momentum imbalance and asymmetry. We demonstrate\nthat these tagged processes can be used to accurately study the physics of\nheavy quark production and propagation in dense QCD matter.\n", "  We discuss post-processing of speech that has been recorded during Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) of the vocal tract. Such speech recordings are\ncontaminated by high levels of acoustic noise from the MRI scanner. Also, the\nfrequency response of the sound signal path is not flat as a result of severe\nrestrictions on recording instrumentation due to MRI technology.\n  The post-processing algorithm for noise reduction is based on adaptive\nspectral filtering. The speech material consists of samples of prolonged vowel\nproductions that are used for validation of the post-processing algorithm. The\ncomparison data is recorded in anechoic chamber from the same test subject.\nFormant analysis is carried out for the post-processed speech and the\ncomparison data. Artificially noise-contaminated vowel samples are used for\nvalidation experiments to determine performance of the algorithm where using\ntrue data would be difficult.\n  The properties of recording instrumentation or the post-processing algorithm\ndo not explain the consistent frequency dependent discrepancy between formant\ndata from experiments during MRI and in anechoic chamber. It is shown that the\ndiscrepancy is statistically significant, in particular, where it is largest at\n1 kHz and 2 kHz. The reflecting surfaces of the MRI head and neck coil are\nsuspected to change the speech acoustics which results in \"external formants\"\nat these frequencies. However, the role of test subject adaptation to noise and\nconstrained space acoustics during an MRI examination cannot be ruled out.\n", "  The North Pacific exhibits patterns of low-frequency variability on the\nintra-annual to decadal time scales, which manifest themselves in both model\ndata and the observational record, and prediction of such low-frequency modes\nof variability is of great interest to the community. While parametric models,\nsuch as stationary and non-stationary autoregressive models, possibly including\nexternal factors, may perform well in a data-fitting setting, they may perform\npoorly in a prediction setting. Ensemble analog forecasting, which relies on\nthe historical record to provide estimates of the future based on past\ntrajectories of those states similar to the initial state of interest, provides\na promising, nonparametric approach to forecasting that makes no assumptions on\nthe underlying dynamics or its statistics. We apply such forecasting to\nlow-frequency modes of variability for the North Pacific sea surface\ntemperature and sea ice concentration fields extracted through Nonlinear\nLaplacian Spectral Analysis. We find such methods may outperform parametric\nmethods and simple persistence with increased predictive skill.\n", "  We have measured the aperture-array noise temperature of the first Mk. II\nphased array feed that CSIRO has built for the Australian Square Kilometre\nArray Pathfinder telescope. As an aperture array, the Mk. II phased array feed\nachieves a beam equivalent noise temperature less than 40 K from 0.78 GHz to\n1.7 GHz and less than 50 K from 0.7 GHz to 1.8 GHz for a boresight beam\ndirected at the zenith. We believe these are the lowest reported noise\ntemperatures over these frequency ranges for ambient-temperature phased arrays.\nThe measured noise temperature includes receiver electronics noise, ohmic\nlosses in the array, and stray radiation from sidelobes illuminating the sky\nand ground away from the desired field of view. This phased array feed was\ndesigned for the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder to demonstrate\nfast astronomical surveys with a wide field of view for the Square Kilometre\nArray.\n", "  Let $P$ be a polarization on a symplectic manifold for which there exists a\nmetalinear frame bundle. We show that for any other compatible polarization\n$P'$ there exists a unique metalinear frame bundle such that the BKS-pairing is\nwell defined. This means that we do not need the metaplectic frame bundle (nor\na positivity condition on $P$) to achieve this goal, and thus the name\n\"metaplectic correction\" is inappropriate.\n", "  A review is made of the basic tools used in mathematics to define a calculus\nfor pseudodifferential operators on Riemannian manifolds endowed with a\nconnection: esistence theorem for the function that generalizes the phase;\nanalogue of Taylor's theorem; torsion and curvature terms in the symbolic\ncalculus; the two kinds of derivative acting on smooth sections of the\ncotangent bundle of the Riemannian manifold; the concept of symbol as an\nequivalence class. Physical motivations and applications are then outlined,\nwith emphasis on Green functions of quantum field theory and Parker's\nevaluation of Hawking radiation.\n", "  We have recently demonstrated a very favorable, inexpensive modernization of\nlab-based x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and high-resolution x-ray\nemission spectroscopy (XES) using only commercially-available optics and x-ray\ntube sources. Here, we survey several proven instrument designs that can be\nreadily implemented in any laboratory setting to achieve synchrotron-quality\nXAFS and XES for many systems in the 5 keV to 10 keV energy range. These\napproaches are based on our immediate experience with the development of: (1)\nan inexpensive, low-powered monochromator capable of performing either XAFS or\nXES, (2) a mid-scale XAFS user facility having 10^6/sec flux with sub-eV\nbandwidth on each of two independent beamlines, and (3) multiple XES\nspectrometers having 3rd-generation synchrotron performance for battery and\nactinide research.\n", "  Recently developed instrumentation at the University of Washington has\nallowed for nonresonant x-ray emission spectra (XES) to be measured in a\nlaboratory-setting with an inexpensive, easily operated system. We present a\ncritical evaluation of this equipment by means of K\\b{eta} and valence-level\nXES measurements for several Co compounds. We find peak count rates of ~5000/s\nfor concentrated samples and a robust relative energy scale with\nreproducibility of 25 meV or better. We furthermore find excellent agreement\nwith synchrotron measurements with only modest loss in energy resolution.\nInstruments such as ours, based on only conventional sources that are widely\nsold for elemental analysis by x-ray fluorescence, can fill an important role\nto diversify the research applications of XES both by their presence in\nnon-synchrotron laboratories and by their use in conjunction with XAFS\nbeamlines where the complementarity of XAFS and XES holds high scientific\npotential.\n", "  We consider the Euler equations of incompressible inviscid fluid dynamics. We\ndiscuss a variational formulation of the governing equations in Lagrangian\ncoordinates. We compute variational symmetries of the action functional and\ngenerate corresponding conservation laws in Lagrangian coordinates. We clarify\nand demonstrate relationships between symmetries and the classical balance laws\nof energy, linear momentum, center of mass, angular momentum, and the statement\nof vorticity advection. Using a newly obtained scaling symmetry, we obtain a\nnew conservation law for the Euler equations in Lagrangian coordinates in\nn-dimensional space. The resulting integral balance relates the total kinetic\nenergy to a new integral quantity defined in Lagrangian coordinates. This\nrelationship implies an inequality which describes the radial deformation of\nthe fluid, and shows the non-existence of time-periodic solutions with nonzero,\nfinite energy.\n", "  The magnetic moment of the $\\Lambda \\to \\Sigma^0$ transition between negative\nparity, baryons is calculated in framework of the QCD sum rules approach, using\nthe general form of the interpolating currents. The pollution arising from the\npositive--to--positive, and positive to negative parity baryons are eliminated\nby constructing the sum rules for different Lorentz structures. Nonzero value\nof the considered magnetic moment can be attributed to the violation of the\n$SU(3)$ symmetry.\n", "  We use a simple one-zone galactic chemical evolution model to quantify the\nuncertainties generated by the input parameters in numerical predictions, for a\ngalaxy with properties similar to those of the Milky Way. We compiled several\nstudies from the literature to gather the current constraints for our\nsimulations regarding the typical value and uncertainty of seven basic\nparameters, which are: the lower and upper mass limits of the stellar initial\nmass function (IMF), the slope of the high-mass end of the stellar IMF, the\nslope of the delay-time distribution function of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia),\nthe number of SNeIa per Msun formed, the total stellar mass formed, and the\nfinal mass of gas. We derived a probability distribution function to express\nthe range of likely values for every parameter, which were then included in a\nMonte Carlo code to run several hundred simulations with randomly selected\ninput parameters. This approach enables us to analyze the predicted chemical\nevolution of 16 elements in a statistical way by identifying the most probable\nsolutions along with their 68% and 95% confidence levels. Our results show that\nthe overall uncertainties are shaped by several input parameters that\nindividually contribute at different metallicities, and thus at different\ngalactic ages. The level of uncertainty then depends on the metallicity and is\ndifferent from one element to another. Among the seven input parameters\nconsidered in this work, the slope of the IMF and the number of SNe Ia are\ncurrently the two main sources of uncertainty.\n", "  We study superconformal indices of 4d N=2 class S theories with certain\nirregular punctures called type $I_{k, N}$. This class of theories include\ngeneralized Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_{k-1}, A_{N-1})$ and more. We\nconjecture the superconformal indices in certain simplified limits based on the\nTQFT structure of the class S theories by writing an expression for the wave\nfunction corresponding to the puncture $I_{k, N}$. We write the Schur limit of\nthe wave function when $k$ and $N$ are coprime. When $k=2$, we also conjecture\na closed-form expression for the Hall-Littlewood index and the Macdonald index\nfor odd $N$. From the index, we argue that certain short-multiplet which can\nappear in the OPE of the stress-energy tensor is absent in the $(A_1, A_{2n})$\ntheory. We also discuss the mixed Schur indices for the N=1 class S theories\nwith irregular punctures.\n", "  A system comprising a $\\Lambda$-type or V-type atom interacting with two\nradiation fields exhibits, during its dynamical evolution, interesting optical\nphenomena such as electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and a variety\nof nonclassical effects. Signatures of the latter are seen in the entanglement\ndynamics of the atomic subsystem and in appropriate field observables. Some of\nthese effects have been experimentally detected, and have even been used to\nchange the nonlinear optical properties of certain atomic media. It is\ntherefore useful to investigate the roles played by specific initial states of\nthe radiation fields, detuning parameters, field nonlinearities and the nature\nof field-atom couplings on EIT and on the entanglement between subsystems. We\ninvestigate these aspects in the framework of a simple model that captures the\nsalient features of such tripartite entangled systems. Entanglement dynamics is\nshown to be very sensitive to the intensity-dependent atom-field couplings.\nUnexpected interesting features pertaining to the collapses and revivals of the\natomic subsystem von Neumann entropy appear. These features could, in\nprinciple, be useful in enabling entanglement.\n", "  We show that it is possible to construct a well-defined effective field\ntheory incorporating string winding modes without using strong constraint in\ndouble field theory. We show that X-ray (Radon) transform on a torus is\nwell-suited for describing weakly constrained double fields, and any weakly\nconstrained fields are represented as a sum of strongly constrained fields.\nUsing inverse X- ray transform we define a novel binary operation which is\ncompatible with the level matching constraint. Based on this formalism, we\nconstruct a consistent gauge transform and gauge invariant action without using\nstrong constraint. We then discuss the relation of our result to the closed\nstring field theory. Our construction suggests that there exists an effective\nfield theory description for massless sector of closed string field theory on a\ntorus in an associative truncation.\n", "  Results of t production in Al foil monitors are presented. These foils have\nbeen irradiated by protons of different energies in a range of 0.04 - 2.6 GeV.\nThe irradiations were carried out at the ITEP accelerator U-10 under the ISTC\nProject 3266 during 2006 - 2009. t has been extracted from Al foils using an\nA307 Sample Oxidizer. The values of the Al(p,x)t cross sections obtained in\nthese experiments are compared with data measured at other laboratories and\nwith results of simulations by the MCNP6 radiation transport code using the\nCEM03.03 event generator.\n", "  Recent simulations have indicated that the dark matter halos of galaxy\nclusters should feature steep density jumps near the virial radius. Since the\nmember galaxies are expected to follow similar collisionless dynamics as the\ndark matter, the galaxy density profile should show such a feature as well. We\nexamine the potential of current datasets to test this prediction by selecting\ncluster members for a sample of 56 low-redshift (0.1<z<0.3) galaxy clusters,\nconstructing their projected number density profiles, and fitting them with two\nprofiles, one with a steep density jump and one without. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the presence of a jump using a non-parametric spline approach. We\nfind that some of these clusters show strong evidence for a model with a\ndensity jump. We discuss avenues for further analysis of the density jump with\nfuture datasets.\n", "  In this work, we propose and test a method for calculating Stokes drag\napplicable to particle-laden fluid flows where two-way momentum coupling is\nimportant. In the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to\nfluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum\nequations. When the particle Reynolds number is small and the particle diameter\nis smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum\ncoupling source term as the Stokes drag. The Stokes drag force depends on the\ndifference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle\nlocation, and the particle velocity. However, owing to two-way coupling, the\nfluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its\nundisturbed value. This causes the computed Stokes drag force to be\nunderestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. We develop\nestimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to\nthe grid size. We then develop a correction method that estimates the\nundisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. The\ncorrection scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent\nfluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an\norder of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.\n", "  In this paper, we present a computationally efficient method for including\nfluid-solid interactions into direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes\nequations. This method is found to be as powerful as our earlier formulation\n[J. Comp. Phys., vol. 249: 243 (2015)], while outperforming the earlier method\nin terms of computational efficiency. The performance and efficacy of the\npresented method are demonstrated by computing contact angles of droplets at\nequilibrium. Furthermore, we study the instability of films due to\ndestabilizing fluid-solid interactions, and discuss the influence of contact\nangle and inertial effects on film breakup. In particular, direct simulation\nresults show an increase in the final characteristic length scales when\ncompared to the predictions of a linear stability analysis, suggesting\nsignificant influence of nonlinear effects. Our results also show that emerging\nlength scales differ, depending on a number of physical dimensions considered.\n", "  Nuclear fragments emitted at 3.5 degrees in 12C fragmentation at 0.6\nGeV/nucleon have been measured. The spectra obtained are used for testing the\npredictions of four ion-ion interaction models: INCL++, BC, LAQGSM03.03 and QMD\nas well as for the comparison with the analytical parametrization in the\nframework of thermodynamical picture of fragmentation.\n", "  Recent anomalies found in cosmological datasets such as the low multipoles of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background or the low redshift amplitude and growth of\nclustering measured by e.g., abundance of galaxy clusters and redshift space\ndistortions in galaxy surveys, have motivated explorations of models beyond\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM. Of particular interest are models where general\nrelativity (GR) is modified on large cosmological scales. Here we consider\ndeviations from $\\Lambda$CDM+GR within the context of Horndeski gravity, which\nis the most general theory of gravity with second derivatives in the equations\nof motion. We adopt a parametrization in which the four additional Horndeski\nfunctions of time $\\alpha_i(t)$ are proportional to the cosmological density of\ndark energy $\\Omega_{DE}(t)$. Constraints on this extended parameter space\nusing a suite of state-of-the art cosmological observations are presented for\nthe first time. Although the theory is able to accommodate the low multipoles\nof the Cosmic Microwave Background and the low amplitude of fluctuations from\nredshift space distortions, we find no significant tension with $\\Lambda$CDM+GR\nwhen performing a global fit to recent cosmological data and thus there is no\nevidence against $\\Lambda$CDM+GR from an analysis of the value of the Bayesian\nevidence ratio of the modified gravity models with respect to $\\Lambda$CDM,\ndespite introducing extra parameters. The posterior distribution of these extra\nparameters that we derive return strong constraints on any possible deviations\nfrom $\\Lambda$CDM+GR in the context of Horndeski gravity. We illustrate how our\nresults can be applied to a more general frameworks of modified gravity models.\n", "  Radiative heat transfer between parallel objects separated by deep\nsub-wavelength distances and subject to large thermal gradients (>100 K) could\nenable breakthrough technologies for electricity generation and thermal\ntransport control. However, thermal transport in this regime has never been\nachieved experimentally due to the difficulty of maintaining large thermal\ngradients over nm-scale distances while avoiding other heat transfer mechanism\nsuch as conduction. Previous experimental measurement between parallel planes\nwere limited to distances greater than 500 nm (with a 20 K thermal gradient),\nwhich is much larger than the theoretically predicted distance (<100 nm)\nrequired for most applications. Here we show near-field radiative heat transfer\nbetween parallel nanostructures in the deep sub-wavelength regime using high\nprecision micro electromechanical (MEMS) displacement control. We also exploit\nthe high mechanical stability of structures under high tensile stress to\nminimize thermal buckling effects and maintain small separations at large\nthermal gradients. We achieve an enhancement of heat transfer of almost two\norders of magnitude relative to the far-field limit, which corresponds to a 54\nnm separation. We also achieve a high temperature gradient (260 K) between the\ncold and hot surfaces while maintaining a ~100 nm distance.\n", "  We review our recent calculations of neutrino-antineutrino pair production\nfrom bremsstrahlung processes in hadronic collisions at temperature and\ndensities relevant for core-collapse supernovae. We focus on neutron-neutron\nand neutron-alpha collisions.\n", "  We study the vertical structure of a stellar disk obtained from a fully\ncosmological high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of a\nMilky Way-like galaxy. At the present day, the disk's mean vertical height\nshows a well-defined and strong pattern, with amplitudes as large as 3 kpc in\nits outer regions. This pattern is the result of a satellite - host halo - disk\ninteraction and reproduces, qualitatively, many of the observable properties of\nthe Monoceros Ring. In particular we find disk material at the distance of\nMonoceros ($R \\sim$ 12-16 kpc, galactocentric) extending far above the mid\nplane ( 30$^{\\circ}$, $\\langle Z \\rangle \\sim$ 1-2 kpc) in both hemispheres, as\nwell as well-defined arcs of disk material at heliocentric distances $\\gtrsim\n5$ kpc. The pattern was first excited $\\approx 3$ Gyr ago as an $m=1$ mode that\nlater winds up into a leading spiral pattern. Interestingly, the main driver\nbehind this perturbation is a low-mass low-velocity fly-by encounter. The\nsatellite has total mass, pericentre distance and pericentric velocity of $\\sim\n5\\%$ of the host, $\\sim 80$ kpc, and 215 km/s, respectively. The satellite is\nnot massive enough to directly perturb the galactic disk but we show that the\ndensity field of the host dark matter halo responds to this interaction\nresulting in a strong amplification of the perturbative effects. This\nsubsequently causes the onset and development of the Monoceros-like feature.\n", "  An overarching scientific challenge for the coming decade is to discover the\nmeaning of confinement, its relationship to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking\n(DCSB) - the origin of visible mass - and the connection between them. In\nprogressing toward meeting this challenge, significant progress has been made\nusing continuum methods in QCD. For example, a novel understanding of gluon and\nquark confinement and its consequences has begun to emerge from quantum field\ntheory; a clear picture is being drawn of how hadron masses emerge dynamically\nin a universe with light quarks; and ground-state hadron wave functions with a\ndirect connection to QCD are becoming available, which reveal that quark-quark\ncorrelations are crucial in hadron structure. There is growing experimental\nsupport for this body of predictions in both elastic and\nnucleon-to-resonance-transition form factors.\n", "  The nucleon resonances near 2 GeV are investigated through the $\\Sigma$(1385)\nand $\\Lambda(1520)$ photoproductions within a Regge-plus-resonance approach\nbased on the new experimental data released by the CLAS Collaboration. The\n$\\Delta(2000)$ and the $N(2120)$ are found essential to reproduce the\nexperimental data and should be assigned as second $[\\Delta 5/2^+]$ and third\n$[N3/2^-]$ in the constituent quark model, respectively. A calculation of the\nbinding energy and decay pattern supports that the $N(1875)$, which is listed\nin the PDG as the third $N3/2^-$ nucleon resonance instead of the $N(2120)$, is\nfrom the $\\Sigma(1385)K$ interaction rather than a three quark state.\n", "  Following the recent observation of localised phonon polaritons in\nuser-defined silicon carbide nano-resonators, here we demonstrate coherent\ncoupling between those localised modes and propagating phonon polaritons bound\nto the surface of the nano-resonator's substrate. In order to obtain\nphase-matching, the nano-resonators have been fabricated to serve the double\nfunction of hosting the localised modes, while also acting as grating for the\npropagating ones. The coherent coupling between long lived, optically\naccessible localised modes, and low-loss propagative ones, opens the way to the\ndesign and realisation of phonon-polariton based quantum circuits.\n", "  In this work, we interpret part of the boundary conditions as external\nsources in order to solve the integrability problem present in the computation\nof surface charges associated to gauge symmetries in the hamiltonian formalism.\nWe start by describing the hamiltonian structure of external symmetries\npreserving the action up to a transformation of the external sources of the\ntheory. We then extend these results to the computation of surface charges for\nfield theories with non-trivial boundary conditions.\n", "  We study the breakup of $^{37}$Mg on Pb at 244MeV/u with the recently\ndeveloped extended theory of Coulomb breakup within the post-form finite range\ndistorted wave Born approximation that includes deformation of the projectile.\nComparing our calculated cross section with the available Coulomb breakup data\nwe determine the possible ground state configuration of $^{37}$Mg.\n", "  The Feynman identity (FI) of a planar graph relates the Euler polynomial of\nthe graph to an infinite product over the equivalence classes of closed\nnonperiodic signed cycles in the graph. The main objectives of this paper are\nto compute the number of equivalence classes of nonperiodic cycles of given\nlength and sign in a planar graph and to interpret the data encoded by the FI\nin the context of free Lie superalgebras. This solves in the case of planar\ngraphs a problem first raised by S. Sherman and sets the FI as the denominator\nidentity of a free Lie superalgebra generated from a graph. Other results are\nobtained. For instance, in connection with zeta functions of graphs.\n", "  We present a passively mode-locked, tunable soliton Ho:fiber ring oscillator,\noptimized for seeding of Ho:YLF amplifiers. The oscillator is independently\ntunable in central wavelength and spectral width from 2040 nm to 2070 nm and\nfrom 5 nm to 10 nm, respectively. At all settings the pulse energy within the\nsoliton is around 800 pJ. The soliton oscillator was optimized to fully meets\nthe spectral requirements for seeding Ho:YLF amplifiers. Its Kelly sidebands\nare located outside the amplifier gain spectrum, resulting in a train of about\n1 ps long pedestal-free pulses with relative intensity noise (RIN) of only 0.13\n% RMS when integrated from 1 Hz to Nyquist frequency.\n", "  Recurrent temporal dynamics is a phenomenon observed frequently in\nhigh-dimensional complex systems and its detection is a challenging task.\nRecurrence quantification analysis utilizing recurrence plots may extract such\ndynamics, however it still encounters an unsolved pertinent problem: the\noptimal selection of distance thresholds for estimating the recurrence\nstructure of dynamical systems. The present work proposes a stochastic Markov\nmodel for the recurrent dynamics that allows to derive analytically a criterion\nfor the optimal distance threshold. The goodness of fit is assessed by a\nutility function which assumes a local maximum for that threshold reflecting\nthe optimal estimate of the system's recurrence structure. We validate our\napproach by means of the nonlinear Lorenz system and its linearized stochastic\nsurrogates. The final application to neurophysiological time series obtained\nfrom anesthetized animals illustrates the method and reveals novel dynamic\nfeatures of the underlying system. As a conclusion, we propose the number of\noptimal recurrence domains as a statistic for classifying an animals' state of\nconsciousness.\n", "  The analysis on nucleon structure functions at small Bjorken $x$ in the\nframework of holographic QCD is presented. In the model setup, the complicated\nnonperturbative interaction between the virtual photon and the target nucleon\nis described via the Pomeron exchange, which corresponds to the reggeized\ngraviton exchange in the AdS space. We show that our calculations for both\n$F_2$ and $F_L$ structure functions are in agreement with the experimental data\nmeasured at HERA.\n", "  Using holography we have studied the time-dependent potential of a\nquark-antiquark pair in a dynamical strongly coupled plasma. The time-dependent\nplasma, whose dynamics is originated from the energy injection, is dual to\nAdS-Vaidya background. The quark-antiquark pair is represented by the endpoints\nof a string stretched from the boundary to the bulk. The evolution of the\nsystem is studied by evaluating the potential between quark and anti-quark,\nextracted from the expectation value of the Wilson loop, throughout the\nprocess. Our results show that the time-dependent potential depends on the\nspeed of injecting energy as well as the final temperature of the plasma. For\nhigh enough temperatures and rapid energy injection, the potential starts\noscillating around its equilibrium value, immediately after the injection.\n", "  We explore the use of mean field models to approximate microscopic nuclear\nequations of state derived from chiral effective field theory across the\ndensities and temperatures relevant for simu- lating astrophysical phenomena\nsuch as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. We consider\nboth relativistic mean field theory with scalar and vector meson exchange as\nwell as energy density functionals based on Skyrme phenomenology and compare to\nthermodynamic equa- tions of state derived from chiral two- and three-nucleon\nforces in many-body perturbation theory. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of\nsymmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter are used to determine the\ndensity regimes in which perturbation theory with chiral nuclear forces is\nvalid. Within the theoretical uncertainties associated with the many-body\nmethods, we find that select mean field models describe well microscopic\nnuclear thermodynamics. As an additional consistency requirement, we study as\nwell the single-particle properties of nucleons in a hot/dense environment,\nwhich affect e.g., charged-current weak reactions in neutron-rich matter. The\nidentified mean field models can be used across a larger range of densities and\ntemperatures in astrophysical simulations than more computationally expensive\nmicroscopic models.\n", "  We investigate the $^9$Be + $^{208}$Pb elastic scattering, breakup and fusion\nat energies around the Coulomb barrier. The three processes are described\nsimultaneously, with identical conditions of calculations. The $^{9}$Be nucleus\nis defined in an $\\alpha + \\alpha$ + n three-body model, using the\nhyperspherical coordinate method. We first analyze spectroscopic properties of\n$^9$Be, and show that the model provides a fairly good description of the\nlow-lying states. The scattering with $^{208}$Pb is then studied with the\nContinuum Discretized Coupled Channel (CDCC) method, where the $\\alpha+\\alpha$\n+ n continuum is approximated by a discrete number of pseudostates. Optical\npotentials for the $\\alpha$+ $^{208}$Pb and n+ $^{208}$Pb systems are taken\nfrom the literature. We present elastic-scattering and fusion cross sections at\ndifferent energies.\n", "  We calculate the non-symmetrized finite-frequency NS-FF noise for a\nsingle-level quantum dot connected to reservoirs in the spinless\nnon-interacting case. The calculations are performed within the framework of\nthe Keldysh Green's function formalism in the wide band approximation limit. We\nestablish the general formula for NS-FF noise for any values of temperature,\nfrequency and bias voltage. The electron transfer processes from one to the\nother reservoir act via the transmission amplitude and transmission coefficient\ndepending on the energy. By taking the symmetrized version of this expression,\nwe show that our result coincides with the expression of the finite frequency\nnoise obtained by B\\\"uttiker using the scattering theory. We also give the\nexplicit analytical expression for the NS-FF noise in the zero temperature\nlimit. By performing numerical calculations, we finally discuss the evolution\nof the NS-FF noise spectrum when varying temperature, dot energy level, and\ncoupling strength to the reservoirs, revealing a large variety of behaviors\nwith different symmetry properties.\n", "  It is discovered that the tokamak field geometry generates a pitch-angle\nscattering effect for runaway electrons. This neoclassical pitch-angle\nscattering is much stronger than the collisional scattering and invalidates the\ngyro-center model for runaway electrons. As a result, the energy limit of\nrunaway electrons is found to be larger than the prediction of the gyro-center\nmodel and to depend heavily on the background magnetic field.\n", "  We demonstrate that the recently observed $X$, $Y$, $Z$ states cannot be\npurely from kinematic effect. Especially the narrow near-threshold structures\nin elastic channels call for nearby poles of the $S$-matrix which are qualified\nas states. We propose a way to distinguish cusp effects from genuine states and\ndemonstrate that (not all of) the recently observed $X$, $Y$, $Z$ states cannot\nbe purely from kinematic effects. Especially, we show that the narrow\nnear-threshold structures in elastic channels call for nearby poles of the\n$S$-matrix, since the normal kinematic cusp effect cannot produce that narrow\nstructures in the elastic channels in contrast to genuine $S$-matrix poles. In\naddition, it is also discussed how spectra can be used to distinguish different\nscenarios proposed for the structure of those poles, such as hadro-quarkonia,\ntetraquarks and hadronic molecules. The basic tool employed is heavy quark spin\nsymmetry.\n", "  In the present talk, we report a recent investigation on photoproduction of\nthe $\\gamma N \\to f_0(500)N$ within a framework of the effective Lagrangian. We\ninclude the nucleon resonances with pin $1/2$ in the $s$ channel. The coupling\nconstants have been etermined by assuming that the decay process $N^* \\to\n(\\pi\\pi)_{I=0,J=0}N$ can be regarded as $N^* \\to f_0(500) N$. We discuss the\nnumerical results for the total cross sections and possible extension of the\npresent work.\n", "  Amorphous packings of spheres have been intensely investigated in order to\nunderstand the mechanical and flow behaviour of dense granular matter, and to\nexplore universal aspects of the transition from fluid to structurally arrested\nor jammed states. Considerable attention has recently been focussed on\nanisotropic packings of frictional grains generated by shear deformation\nleading to shear jamming, which occurs below the jamming density for isotropic\npackings of frictionless grains. With the aim of disentangling the role of\nshear deformation induced structures and friction in generating shear jamming,\nwe study sheared assemblies of frictionless spheres computationally, over a\nwide range of densities, extending far below the isotropic jamming point. We\ndemonstrate the emergence of a variety of geometric features characteristic of\njammed packings with the increase of shear strain. The average contact number\nand the distributions of contact forces suggest the presence of a threshold\ndensity, well below the isotropic jamming point, above which a qualitative\nchange occurs in the jamming behaviour of sheared configurations. We show that\nabove this threshold density, friction stabilizes the sheared configurations we\ngenerate. Our results thus reveal the emergence of geometric features\ncharacteristic of jammed states as a result of shear deformation alone, while\nfriction is instrumental in stabilising packings over a range of densities\nbelow the isotropic jamming point.\n", "  Vaidman pointed out the importance of modular values, and related the modular\nvalue of a Pauli spin operator to its weak value for specific coupling\nstrengths [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 230401 (2010)]. It would be useful if this\nrelationship is generalized since a modular value, which assumes a finite\nstrength of the measurement interaction, is sometimes more practical than a\nweak value, which assumes an infinitesimally small interaction. In this paper,\nwe give a general expression that relates the weak value and the modular value\nof an arbitrary observable in the 2-dimensional Hilbert space for an arbitrary\ncoupling strength. Using this expression, we show the \"failure of sum rule\" for\nmodular values, which has a resemblance to the \"failure of product rule\" for\nweak values. We give examples of \"failure of sum rule\" for some interesting\ncases, i.e., paradoxes based on nonlocality, which include EPR paradox, Hardy's\nparadox, and Cheshire cat experiment.\n", "  Random non-commutative geometries are introduced by integrating over the\nspace of Dirac operators that form a spectral triple with a fixed algebra and\nHilbert space. The cases with the simplest types of Clifford algebra are\ninvestigated using Monte Carlo simulations to compute the integrals. Various\nqualitatively different types of behaviour of these random Dirac operators are\nexhibited. Some features are explained in terms of the theory of random\nmatrices but other phenomena remain mysterious. Some of the models with a\nquartic action of symmetry-breaking type display a phase transition. Close to\nthe phase transition the spectrum of a typical Dirac operator shows\nmanifold-like behaviour for the eigenvalues below a cut-off scale.\n", "  We consider one-dimensional bosonic chains with a repulsive boson-boson\ninteraction that decays exponentially on large length-scales. This model\ndescribes transport of Cooper-pairs in a Josepshon junction array, or transport\nof magnetic flux quanta in quantum-phase-slip ladders, i.e. arrays of\nsuperconducting wires in a ladder-configuration that allow for the coherent\ntunnelling of flux quanta. In the low-frequency, long wave-length regime these\nchains can be mapped to an effective model of a one-dimensional elastic field\nin a disordered potential. The onset of transport in these systems, when biased\nby external voltage, is described by the standard depinning theory of elastic\nmedia in disordered pinning potentials. We numerically study the regimes that\nare of relevance for quantum-phase-slip ladders. These are (i) very short\nchains and (ii) the regime of weak disorder. For chains shorter than the\ntypical pinning length, i.e., the Larkin length, the chains reach a saturation\nregime where the depinning voltage does not depend on the decay length of the\nrepulsive interaction. In the regime of weak disorder we find an emergent\ncorrelation length-scale that depends on the disorder strength. For arrays\nshorter than this length the onset of transport is similar to the clean arrays,\ni.e., is due to the penetration of solitons into the array. We discuss the\ndepinning scenarios for longer arrays in this regime.\n", "  BGO-OD is a newly commissioned experiment to investigate the internal\nstructure of the nucleon, using an energy tagged bremsstrahlung photon beam at\nthe ELSA electron facility. The setup consists of a highly segmented BGO\ncalorimeter surrounding the target, with a particle tracking magnetic\nspectrometer at forward angles. BGO-OD is ideal for investigating meson\nphotoproduction. The extensive physics programme for open strangeness\nphotoproduction is introduced, and preliminary analysis presented.\n", "  Strangeness photoproduction in the elementary reactions $\\gamma N\\rightarrow\nKY$ offers the possibility to study nucleon resonances in the mass region above\n1.7 GeV, where the number of states and their properties are still under\ndebate. These reactions could allow the first 'complete' experiment in\npseudoscalar meson photoproduction due to the easier access to recoil\npolarization observables in experiments. In addition to measurements on proton\ntargets, a full isospin decomposition of the $I=1/2$ electromagnetic amplitudes\nrequires also data obtained from quasifree neutron targets. This contribution\nshows first preliminary results on feasibility studies for such measurements at\nthe A2 experiment at MAMI.\n", "  Assuming that the recently observed hidden-charm pentaquark state,\n$P_c(4450)$, is of molecular nature as predicted in the unitary approach, we\npropose to study the decay of $\\Xi^-_b\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^- \\Lambda$ to search\nfor the strangeness counterpart of the $P_c(4450)$. There are three ingredients\nin the decay mechanism: the weak decay mechanism, the hadronization mechanism,\nand the finite state interactions in the meson-baryon system of strangeness\n$S=-2$ and isospin $I=1/2$ and of the $J/\\psi\\Lambda$. All these have been\ntested extensively. As a result, we provide a genuine prediction of the\ndifferential cross section where a strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark state,\nthe counterpart of the $P_c(4450)$, can be clearly seen. The decay rate is\nestimated to be of similar magnitude as the $\\Lambda_b^0\\rightarrow J/\\psi K^-\np$ observed by the LHCb collaboration.\n", "  We show how a symmetry reduction of the equations for incompressible\nhydrodynamics in three dimensions leads naturally to a Monge-Amp\\`ere\nstructure, and Burgers'-type vortices are a canonical class of solutions\nassociated with this structure. The mapping of such solutions, which are\ncharacterised by a linear dependence of the third component of the velocity on\nthe coordinate defining the axis of rotation, to solutions of the\nincompressible equations in two dimensions is also shown to be an example of a\nsymmetry reduction The Monge-Amp\\`ere structure for incompressible flow in two\ndimensions is shown to be hypersymplectic.\n", "  We consider the electronic analog of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer from\nquantum optics. In this realistic condensed matter device, single electrons are\ninjected and travel along opposite chiral edge states of the integer quantum\nHall effect, colliding at a quantum point contact (QPC). We monitor the fate of\nthe colliding excitations by calculating zero-frequency current correlations at\nthe output of the QPC. In the simpler case of filling factor $\\nu=1$, we\nrecover the standard result of a dip in the current noise as a function of the\ntime delay between electron injections. For simultaneous injection, the current\ncorrelations exactly vanish, as dictated by the Pauli principle. This picture\nis however dramatically modified when interactions are present, as we show in\nthe case of a filling factor $\\nu=2$. There, each edge state is made out of two\nco-propagating channels, leading to charge fractionalization, and ultimately to\ndecoherence. The latter phenomenon reduces the degree of indistinguishability\nbetween the two electron wavepackets, yielding a reduced contrast in the HOM\nsignal. This naturally brings about the question of stronger interaction,\noffering a natural extension of the present work to the case of fractional\nquantum Hall effect where many open and fascinating questions remain.\n", "  European Spallation Source instruments like the macromolecular\ndiffractometer, NMX, require an excellent neutron detection efficiency,\nhigh-rate capabilities, time resolution, and an unprecedented spatial\nresolution in the order of a few hundred micrometers over a wide angular range\nof the incoming neutrons. For these instruments solid converters in combination\nwith Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs) are a promising option. A GEM\ndetector with gadolinium converter was tested on a cold neutron beam at the IFE\nresearch reactor in Norway. The {\\mu}TPC analysis, proven to improve the\nspatial resolution in the case of $^{10}$B converters, is extended to\ngadolinium based detectors. For the first time, a Gd-GEM was successfully\noperated to detect neutrons with a measured efficiency of 11.8% at a wavelength\nof 2 {\\AA} and a position resolution better than 250 {\\mu}m.\n", "  Fusion energy from reacting hydrogen (protons) with the boron isotope 11\n(HB11) resulting in three stable helium nuclei, is without problem of nuclear\nradiation in contrast to DT fusion. But the HB11 reaction driven by nanosecond\nlaser pulses with thermal compression and ignition by lasers is extremely\ndifficult. This changed radically when irradiation with picosecond laser pulses\nproduces a non-thermal plasma block ignition with ultrahigh acceleration. This\nuses the nonlinear (ponderomotive) force to surprisingly resulting in same\nthresholds as DT fusion even under pessimistic assumption of binary reactions.\nAfter evaluation of reactions trapped cylindrically by kilotesla magnetic\nfields and using the measured highly increased HB11 fusion gains for the proof\nof an avalanche of the three alphas in secondary reactions, possibilities for\nan absolutely clean energy source at competitive costs were concluded.\n", "  Understanding helium accumulation in plasma-facing or structural materials in\na fusion reactor starts from uncovering the details of the migration of single\nand paired He interstitials. We have carried out a first-principles density\nfunctional theory investigation into the migration of both a single\ninterstitial He atom and an interstitial He-pair in bcc (Fe, Mo and W) and fcc\n(Cu, Pd and Pt) metals. By identifying the most stable configurations of an\ninterstitial He-pair in each metal and decomposing its motion into rotational,\ntranslational, and rotational-translational routines, we are able to determine\nits migration barrier and trajectory. Our first-principles calculations reveal\nthat the migration trajectories and barriers are determined predominantly by\nthe relatively stable He-pair configurations which depend mainly on the\nstability of a single He in different interstices. Contrary to atomistic\nstudies reported in literature, the migration barrier in bcc Fe, Mo, and W is\n0.07, 0.07, and 0.08 eV respectively, always slightly higher than for a single\ninterstitial He (0.06 eV for all three). Configurations of a He-pair in fcc\nmetals are much more complicated, due to the stability closeness of different\ninterstitial sites for a single He atom. In both Cu and Pd, the migration of a\nHe-pair proceeds by moving one He at a time from one tetrahedral site to\nneighboring octahedral site; whereas in Pt the two He move simultaneously\nbecause the bridge interstitial site presents an extremely low barrier. The\nmigration barrier for a He-pair is 0.05, 0.15, and 0.04 eV for Cu, Pd, and Pt,\nslightly lower than (in Cu), or similar to (in Pd and Pt) a single He, which is\n0.08, 0.15, and 0.03 eV, respectively. The associative motions of a He-pair are\nensured by the strong He-He interactions in metals which are chemical\nbonding-like and can be described very well with Morse potentials.\n", "  A compactness framework is formulated for the incompressible limit of\napproximate solutions with weak uniform bounds with respect to the adiabatic\nexponent for the steady Euler equations for compressible fluids in any\ndimension. One of our main observations is that the compactness can be achieved\nby using only natural weak estimates for the mass conservation and the\nvorticity. Another observation is that the incompressibility of the limit for\nthe homentropic Euler flow is directly from the continuity equation, while the\nincompresibility of the limit for the full Euler flow is from a combination of\nall the Euler equations. As direct applications of the compactness framework,\nwe establish two incompressible limit theorems for multidimensional steady\nEuler flows through infinitely long nozzles, which lead to two new existence\ntheorems for the corresponding problems for multidimensional steady\nincompressible Euler equations.\n", "  We study an intermittent quasistatic dynamical system composed of\nnonuniformly hyperbolic Pomeau--Manneville maps with time-dependent parameters.\nWe prove an ergodic theorem which shows almost sure convergence of time\naverages in a certain parameter range, and identify the unique physical family\nof measures. The theorem also shows convergence in probability in a larger\nparameter range. In the process, we establish other results that will be useful\nfor further analysis of the statistical properties of the model.\n", "  The wide applications of higher dimensional gravity and gauge/gravity duality\nhave fuelled the search for new stationary solutions of the Einstein equation\n(possibly coupled to matter). In this topical review, we explain the\nmathematical foundations and give a practical guide for the numerical solution\nof gravitational boundary value problems. We present these methods by way of\nexample: resolving asymptotically flat black rings, singly-spinning lumpy black\nholes in anti-de Sitter (AdS), and the Gregory-Laflamme zero modes of small\nrotating black holes in AdS$_5\\times S^5$. We also include several tools and\ntricks that have been useful throughout the literature.\n", "  An auxiliary metric (reference metric) is inevitable in massive gravity\ntheory. In the scenario of gauge/gravity duality, a singular reference metric\ncorresponds to momentum dissipations, which describes the electric and heat\nconductivity for normal conductors. We demonstrate in detail that the massive\ngravity with singular reference metric is ghost-free.\n", "  We show that the Parisi formula of the mixed $p$-spin model is a concave\nfunction of the squared inverse temperature. This allows us to derive a new\nexpression for the Parisi formula that involves the inverse temperature and the\nParisi measure as Legendre conjugate variables.\n", "  A great possible achievement for the MMS mission would be crossing electron\ndiffusion regions (EDR). EDR are regions in proximity of reconnection sites\nwhere electrons decouple from field lines, breaking the frozen in condition.\nDecades of research on reconnection have produced a widely shared map of where\nEDRs are. We expect reconnection to take place around a so called x-point\nformed by the intersection of the separatrices dividing inflowing from\noutflowing plasma. The EDR forms around this x-point as a small electron scale\nbox nested inside a larger ion diffusion region. But this point of view is\nbased on a 2D mentality. We have recently proposed that once the problem is\nconsidered in full 3D, secondary reconnection events can form [Lapenta et al.,\nNature Physics, 11, 690, 2015] in the outflow regions even far downstream from\nthe primary reconnection site. We revisit here this new idea confirming that\neven using additional indicators of reconnection and even considering longer\nperiods and wider distances the conclusion remains true: secondary reconnection\nsites form downstream of a reconnection outflow causing a sort of chain\nreaction of cascading reconnection sites. If we are right, MMS will have an\ninteresting journey even when not crossing necessarily the primary site. The\nchances are greatly increased that even if missing a primary site during an\norbit, MMS could stumble instead on one of these secondary sites.\n", "  We analyse the speed of gravitational waves in coupled Galileon models with\nan equation of state $\\omega_\\phi=-1$ now and a ghost-free Minkowski limit. We\nfind that the gravitational waves propagate much faster than the speed of light\nunless these models are small perturbations of cubic Galileons and the Galileon\nenergy density is sub-dominant to a dominant cosmological constant. In this\ncase, the binary pulsar bounds on the speed of gravitational waves can be\nsatisfied and the equation of state can be close to -1 when the coupling to\nmatter and the coefficient of the cubic term of the Galileon Lagrangian are\nrelated. This severely restricts the allowed cosmological behaviour of Galileon\nmodels and we are forced to conclude that Galileons with a stable Minkowski\nlimit cannot account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the\nuniverse on their own. Moreover any sub-dominant Galileon component of our\nuniverse must be dominated by the cubic term. For such models with gravitons\npropagating faster than the speed of light, the gravitons become potentially\nunstable and could decay into photon pairs. They could also emit photons by\nCerenkov radiation. We show that the decay rate of such speedy gravitons into\nphotons and the Cerenkov radiation are in fact negligible. Moreover the time\ndelay between the gravitational signal and light emitted by explosive\nastrophysical events could serve as a confirmation that a modification of\ngravity acts on the largest scales of the Universe.\n", "  We study knots in 3d Chern-Simons theory with complex gauge group\n$SL(N,\\mathbb{C})$, in the context of its relation with 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$\ntheory (the so-called 3d-3d correspondence). The defect has either co-dimension\n2 or co-dimension 4 inside the 6d $(2,0)$ theory, which is compactified on a\n3-manifold $\\hat{M}$. We identify such defects in various corners of the 3d-3d\ncorrespondence, namely in 3d $SL(N,\\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory, in 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory, in 5d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory, and in\nthe M-theory holographic dual. We can make quantitative checks of the 3d-3d\ncorrespondence by computing partition functions at each of these theories. This\nLetter is a companion to a longer paper, which contains more details and more\nresults.\n", "  We present a tomographic cosmic shear study from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS),\nwhich, providing a limiting magnitude r_{lim}~27 (5 sigma), is designed as a\npre-cursor Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) survey with an emphasis on\ndepth. Using five tomographic redshift bins, we study their auto- and\ncross-correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. We use a\nluminosity-dependent nonlinear model to account for the astrophysical\nsystematics originating from intrinsic alignments of galaxy shapes. We find\nthat the cosmological leverage of the DLS is among the highest among existing\n>10 sq. deg cosmic shear surveys. Combining the DLS tomography with the 9-year\nresults of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP9) gives\nOmega_m=0.293_{-0.014}^{+0.012}, sigma_8=0.833_{-0.018}^{+0.011},\nH_0=68.6_{-1.2}^{+1.4} km/s/Mpc, and Omega_b=0.0475+-0.0012 for LCDM, reducing\nthe uncertainties of the WMAP9-only constraints by ~50%. When we do not assume\nflatness for LCDM, we obtain the curvature constraint\nOmega_k=-0.010_{-0.015}^{+0.013} from the DLS+WMAP9 combination, which however\nis not well constrained when WMAP9 is used alone. The dark energy equation of\nstate parameter w is tightly constrained when Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation\n(BAO) data are added, yielding w=-1.02_{-0.09}^{+0.10} with the DLS+WMAP9+BAO\njoint probe. The addition of supernova constraints further tightens the\nparameter to w=-1.03+-0.03. Our joint constraints are fully consistent with the\nfinal Planck results and also the predictions of a LCDM universe.\n", "  In order to investigate the interaction between single vacancies in a\ngraphene sheet, we have used spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT).\nTwo distinct configurations were considered, either with the two vacancies\nlocated in the same sublattice or in different sublattices, and the effect of\nchanging the separation between the vacancies was also studied. Our results\nshow that the ground state of the system is indeed magnetic, but the presence\nof the vacancies in the same sublattice or in different sublattices and the\npossible topological configurations can lead to different contributions from\nthe $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ orbitals to magnetism. On the other hand, our findings\nreveal that the net magnetic moment of the system with the two vacancies in the\nsame sublattice move towards the value of the magnetic moment per isolated\nvacancy with the increase of the distance between the vacancies, which is\nascribed to the different contributions due to $\\pi$ electrons. Moreover, it is\nalso found that the local magnetic moments for vacancies in the same sublattice\nare in parallel configuration, while they have different orientations when the\nvacancies are created in different sublattices. So, our findings have clearly\nevidenced how difficult it would be to observe experimentally the emergence of\nmagnetic order in graphene-based systems containing randomly created atomic\nvacancies, since the energy difference between cases of antiferromagnetic and\nferromagnetic order decreases quickly with the increase in the distance\nseparating each vacancy pair.\n", "  The Voyager probes are the furthest, still active, spacecraft ever launched\nfrom Earth. During their 38-year trip, they have collected data regarding solar\nwind properties (such as the plasma velocity and magnetic field intensity).\nUnfortunately, a complete time evolution of the measured physical quantities is\nnot available. The time series contains many gaps which increase in frequency\nand duration at larger distances. The aim of this work is to perform a spectral\nand statistical analysis of the solar wind plasma velocity and magnetic field\nusing Voyager 2 data measured in 1979, when the gaps/signal ratio is of order\nof unity. This analysis is achieved using four different data reconstruction\ntechniques: averages on linearly interpolated subsets, correlation of linearly\ninterpolated data, compressed sensing spectral estimation, and maximum\nlikelihood data reconstruction. With five frequency decades, the spectra we\nobtained have the largest frequency range ever computed at 5 astronomical units\nfrom the Sun; spectral exponents have been determined for all the components of\nthe velocity and magnetic field fluctuations. Void analysis is also useful in\nrecovering other spectral properties such as integral scales (see for instance\nTable 4) and, if the confidence level of the measurements is sufficiently high,\nthe decay variation in the small scale range due, for instance, to dissipative\neffects.\n", "  In the companion paper~\\cite{paper1}, we use classical measures based on\nforce probability density functions (PDFs), as well as Betti numbers\n(quantifying the number of components, related to force chains, and loops), to\ndescribe the force networks in tapped systems of disks and pentagons. In the\npresent work, we focus on the use of persistence analysis, that allows to\ndescribe these networks in much more detail. This approach allows not only to\ndescribe, but also to quantify the differences between the force networks in\ndifferent realizations of a system, in different parts of the considered\ndomain, or in different systems. We show that persistence analysis clearly\ndistinguishes the systems that are very difficult or impossible to\ndifferentiate using other means. One important finding is that the differences\nin force networks between disks and pentagons are most apparent when loops are\nconsidered: the quantities describing properties of the loops may differ\nsignificantly even if other measures (properties of components, Betti numbers,\nor force PDFs) do not distinguish clearly the investigated systems.\n", "  We examine one asymmetric adnd two fully symmetric Gaussian\ncontinuous-variable systems in terms of their tripartite and bipartite\nentanglement properties. We treat pure states and are able to find analytic\nsolutions using the undepleted pump approximation for the Hamiltonian models,\nand standard beamsplitter relations for a model that mixes the outputs of\noptical parametric oscillators. Our two symmetric systems exhibit perfect\ntripartite correlations, but only in the unphysical limit of infinite\nsqueezing. For more realistic squeezing parameters, all three systems exhibit\nboth tripartite and bipartite entanglement. We conclude that none of the\noutputs are completely analogous to either GHZ or W states, but there are\nparameter regions where they produce T states introduced by Adesso \\etal The\nqualitative differences in the output states for different interaction\nparameters indicate that continuous-variable tripartite quantum information\nsystems offer a versatility not found in bipartite systems.\n", "  We define a deformed kinetic energy operator for a discrete position space\nwith a finite number of points. The structure may be either periodic or\nnonperiodic with well-defined end points. It is shown that for the nonperiodic\ncase the translation operator becomes nonunitary due to the end points. This\nuniquely defines an algebra which has the desired unique representation. Energy\neigenvalues and energy wave functions for both cases are found. As expected, in\nthe continuum limit the solution for the nonperiodic case becomes the same as\nthe solution of an infinite one dimensional square well and the periodic case\nsolution becomes the same as the solution of a particle in a box with periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  Many-body localization (MBL) has emerged as a novel paradigm for robust\nergodicity breaking in closed quantum many-body systems. However, it is not yet\nclear to which extent MBL survives in the presence of dissipative processes\ninduced by the coupling to an environment. Here we study heating and ergodicity\nfor a paradigmatic MBL system---an interacting fermionic chain subject to\nquenched disorder---in the presence of dephasing. We find that, even though the\nsystem is eventually driven into an infinite-temperature state, heating as\nmonitored by the von Neumann entropy can progress logarithmically slowly,\nimplying exponentially large time scales for relaxation. This slow loss of\nmemory of initial conditions make signatures of non-ergodicity visible over a\nlong, but transient, time regime. We point out a potential controlled\nrealization of the considered setup with cold atomic gases held in optical\nlattices.\n", "  We study transport of an inertial Brownian particle moving in a symmetric and\nperiodic one-dimensional potential, and subjected to both a symmetric, unbiased\nexternal harmonic force as well as biased dichotomic noise $\\eta(t)$ also known\nas a random telegraph signal or a two state continuous-time Markov process. In\ndoing so, we concentrate on the previously reported regime [J. Spiechowicz et\nal., Phys. Rev. E 90, 032104 (2014)] for which non-negative biased noise\n$\\eta(t)$ in the form of generalized white Poissonian noise can induce\nanomalous transport processes similar to those generated by a deterministic\nconstant force $F=\\langle \\eta(t) \\rangle $ but significantly more effective\nthan $F$, i.e. the particle moves much faster, the velocity fluctuations are\nnoticeable reduced and the transport efficiency is enhanced several times.\nHere, we confirm this result for the case of dichotomous fluctuations which in\ncontrast to white Poissonian noise can assume positive as well as negative\nvalues and examine the role of thermal noise in the observed phenomenon. We\nfocus our attention on the impact of bidirectionality of dichotomous\nfluctuations and reveal that the effect of non-equilibrium noise enhanced\nefficiency is still detectable. This result may explain transport phenomena\noccurring in strongly fluctuating environments of both a physical and\nbiological origin. Our predictions can be corroborated experimentally by use of\na set-up that consists of a resistively and capacitively shunted Josephson\njunction.\n", "  Increasing the magnetic data recording density requires reducing the size of\nthe individual memory elements of a recording layer as well as employing\nmagnetic materials with temperature-dependent functionalities. Therefore, it is\npredicted that the near future of magnetic data storage technology involves a\ncombination of energy-assisted recording on nanometer-scale magnetic media. We\npresent the potential of heat-assisted magnetic recording on a patterned\nsample; a ferrimagnetic alloy composed of a rare earth and a transition metal,\nDyCo$_5$, which is grown on a hexagonal-ordered nanohole array membrane. The\nmagnetization of the antidot array sample is out-of-plane oriented at room\ntemperature and rotates towards in-plane upon heating above its\nspin-reorientation temperature (T$_R$) of ~350 K, just above room temperature.\nUpon cooling back to room temperature (below T$_R$), we observe a well-defined\nand unexpected in-plane magnetic domain configuration modulating with ~45 nm.\nWe discuss the underlying mechanisms giving rise to this behavior by comparing\nthe magnetic properties of the patterned sample with the ones of its extended\nthin film counterpart. Our results pave the way for novel applications of\nferrimagnetic antidot arrays of superior functionality in magnetic nano-devices\nnear room temperature.\n", "  The $\\gamma$-ray strength functions and level densities of $^{73,74}$Ge have\nbeen extracted up to the neutron separation energy S$_n$ from particle-$\\gamma$\ncoincidence data using the Oslo method. Moreover, the $\\gamma$-ray strength\nfunction of $^{74}$Ge above S$_n$ has been determined from photo-neutron\nmeasurements, hence these two experiments cover the range of E$_\\gamma \\approx$\n1-13 MeV for $^{74}$Ge. The obtained data show that both $^{73,74}$Ge display\nan increase in strength at low $\\gamma$ energies. The experimental $\\gamma$-ray\nstrength functions are compared with $M1$ strength functions deduced from\naverage $B(M1)$ values calculated within the shell model for a large number of\ntransitions. The observed low-energy enhancements in $^{73,74}$Ge are adopted\nin the calculations of the $^{72,73}$Ge(n,$\\gamma$) cross sections, where there\nare no direct experimental data. Calculated reaction rates for more\nneutron-rich germanium isotopes are shown to be strongly dependent on the\npresence of the low-energy enhancement.\n", "  A stability analysis of out of equilibrium and boundary driven systems is\npresented. It is performed in the framework of the hydrodynamic macroscopic\nfluctuation theory and assuming the additivity principle whose interpretation\nis discussed with the help of a Hamiltonian description. An extension of Le\nChatelier principle for out of equilibrium situations is presented which allows\nto formulate the conditions of validity of the additivity principle. Examples\nof application of these results in the realm of classical and quantum systems\nare provided.\n", "  Nanoporous supercapacitors are an important player in the field of energy\nstorage that fill the gap between dielectric capacitors and batteries. The key\nchallenge in the development of supercapacitors is the perceived trade-off\nbetween capacitance and power delivery. Current efforts to boost the\ncapacitance of nanoporous supercapacitors focus on reducing the pore size so\nthat they can only accommodate a single layer of ions. However, this tight\npacking compromises the charging dynamics and hence power density. We show via\nan analytical theory and Monte Carlo simulations that charging is sensitively\ndependent on the affinity of ions to the pores, and that high capacitances can\nbe obtained for ionophobic pores of widths significantly larger than the ion\ndiameter. Our theory also predicts that charging can be hysteretic with a\nsignificant energy loss per cycle for intermediate ionophilicities. We use\nthese observations to explore the parameter regimes in which a\ncapacitance-power-hysteresis trilemma may be avoided.\n", "  Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are the highest energy messengers of\nthe present universe, with energies up to $10^{20}$ eV. Studies of\nastrophysical particles (nuclei, electrons, neutrinos and photons) at their\nhighest observed energies have implications for fundamental physics as well as\nastrophysics. The primary particles interact in the atmosphere and generate\nextensive air showers. Analysis of those showers enables one not only to\nestimate the energy, direction and most probable mass of the primary cosmic\nparticles, but also to obtain information about the properties of their\nhadronic interactions at an energy more than one order of magnitude above that\naccessible with the current highest energy human-made accelerator. In this\ncontribution we will review the state-of-the-art in UHECRs detection. We will\npresent the leading experiments Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array\nand discuss the cosmic ray energy spectrum, searches for directional\nanisotropy, studies of mass composition, the determination of the number of\nshower muons (which is sensitive to the shower hadronic interactions) and the\nproton-air cross section.\n", "  Extreme events represent a challenge to natural as well as man-made systems.\nFor critical infrastructure like power grids, we need to understand their\nresilience against large disturbances. Recently, new measures of the resilience\nof dynamical systems have been developed in the complex system literature.\nBasin stability and survivability respectively assess the asymptotic and\ntransient behavior of a system when subjected to arbitrary, localized but large\nperturbations. To employ these methods to assess the resilience of power grids,\nwe need to choose a model of the power grid. So far the most popular model that\nhas been studied is the classical swing equation model for the frequency\nresponse of generators and motors. In this paper we study a more sophisticated\nmodel of synchronous machines that also takes voltage dynamics into account,\nand compare it to the previously studied model. This model has been found to\ngive an accurate picture of the long term evolution of synchronous machines in\nthe engineering literature for post fault studies. We find evidence that some\nstable fix points of the swing equation become unstable when we add voltage\ndynamics. If this occurs the asymptotic behavior of the system can be\ndramatically altered, and basin stability estimates obtained with the swing\nequation can be dramatically wrong. We also find that the survivability does\nnot change significantly when taking the voltage dynamics into account.\nFurther, the limit cycle type asymptotic behaviour is strongly correlated with\ntransient voltages that violate typical operational voltage bounds. Thus,\ntransient voltage bounds are dominated by transient frequency bounds and play\nno large role for realistic parameters.\n", "  This talk discusses our old work on the hadronic light-by-light contribution\nto the muon anomalous magnetic moment and some more recent contributions. I\ndiscuss the various contributions starting with pseudo-scalar meson exchange,\nthe quark- and pion-loop, as well as scalar and $a_1$-exchange. For the\n$\\pi^0$-exchange I point out a possible large enhancement when only connected\ncontributions are included. For the quark-loop I include some comments about\nthe more recent estimates of this contribution. The pion-loop is discussed in\nmore detail, in particular I discuss our unpublished work on including effects\nfrom $a_1$ and the polarizability.\n", "  We revisit the problem of the dynamics of quantum correlations in the exact\nTavis-Cummings model. We show that many of the dynamical features of quantum\ndiscord attributed to dissipation are already present in the exact framework\nand are due to the well known non-linearities in the model and to the choice of\ninitial conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis, supported by explicit\nanalytical calculations, we find that the dynamics of entanglement and quantum\ndiscord are far from being trivial or intuitive. In this context, we find\nstates that are indistinguishable from the point of view of entanglement and\ndistinguishable from the point of view of quantum discord, states where the two\nquantifiers give opposite information and states where they give roughly the\nsame information about correlations at a certain time. Depending on the initial\nconditions, this model exhibits a fascinating range of phenomena that can be\nused for experimental purposes such as: Robust states against change of\nmanifold or dissipation, tunable entanglement states and states with a\ncounterintuitive sudden birth as the number of photons increase. We furthermore\npropose an experiment called quantum discord gates where discord is zero or\nnon-zero depending on the number of photons.\n", "  Relativistic effects on the precision of quantum metrology for particle\ndetectors, such as two-level atoms are studied. The quantum Fisher information\nis used to estimate the phase sensitivity of atoms in non-inertial motions or\nin gravitational fields. The Unruh-DeWitt model is applicable to the\ninvestigation of the dynamics of a uniformly accelerated atom weakly coupled to\na massless scalar vacuum field. When a measuring device is in the same\nrelativistic motion as the atom, the dynamical behavior of quantum Fisher\ninformation as a function of Rindler proper time are obtained. It is found out\nthat monotonic decrease in phase sensitivity is characteristic of dynamics of\nrelativistic quantum estimation. To improve relativistic quantum metrology, we\nreasonably take into account two reflecting plane boundaries perpendicular to\neach other.\n", "  We study thermal conductivity in the disordered two-dimensional electron\nliquid in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. We describe a\nmicroscopic analysis of the problem using as a starting point the partition\nfunction defined on the Keldysh contour. We extend the Renormalization Group\n(RG) analysis developed for thermal transport in the disordered Fermi liquid,\nand include scattering processes induced by the long-range Coulomb interaction\nin the sub-temperature energy range. For the thermal conductivity, unlike for\nthe electric conductivity, these scattering processes yield a logarithmic\ncorrection which may compete with the RG-corrections. The interest in this\ncorrection arises from the fact that it violates the Wiedemann-Franz law. We\nchecked that the sub-temperature correction to the thermal conductivity is not\nmodified, neither by the inclusion of Fermi liquid interaction amplitudes nor\nas a result of the RG flow. We thereby expect that the answer obtained for this\ncorrection is final. We use the theory to describe thermal transport on the\nmetallic side of the metal-insulator transition in Si MOSFETs.\n", "  A general method for constructing simplicial complex from observed time\nseries of dynamical systems based on the delay coordinate reconstruction\nprocedure is presented. The obtained simplicial complex preserves all pertinent\ntopological features of the reconstructed phase space and it may be analyzes\nfrom topological, combinatorial and algebraic aspects. In focus of this study\nis the computation of homology of the invariant set of some well known\ndynamical systems which display chaotic behavior. Persistent homology of\nsimplicial complex and its relationship with the embedding dimensions are\nexamined by studying the lifetime of topological features and topological\nnoise. The consistency of topological properties for different dynamic regimes\nand embedding dimensions is examined. The obtained results shed new light on\nthe topological properties of the reconstructed phase space and open up new\npossibilities for application of advanced topological methods. the method\npresented here may be used as a generic method for constructing simplicial\ncomplex from a scalar time series which has a number of advantages compared to\nthe mapping of the time series to a complex network.\n", "  We use new equations for the interstitial impurity diffusion fluxes under\nstrain to study impurity atom redistribution in the vicinity of dislocations.\nTwo levels of simulation are applied. The first one is evaluation of\ncoefficients that determine the influence of strain tensor components on\ninterstitial diffusion fluxes in FCC structures. For this purpose we have\ndeveloped a model into the framework of a molecular static method taking into\naccount an atom environment both near the interstitial site and for the\nsaddle-point configuration. The second level is modeling the interstitial\nsegregation formation based on nonlinear diffusion equations that take strains\ngenerated by defects into account. The results show that the distributions of\nthe interstitials near the dislocations have quite complicated characters and\nthe vacancy distribution has a qualitatively different character as compared\nwith the carbon distribution.\n", "  When modeling laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) using the particle-in-cell\n(PIC) algorithm in a Lorentz boosted frame, the plasma is drifting\nrelativistically at $\\beta_b c$ towards the laser, which can lead to a\ncomputational speedup of $\\sim \\gamma_b^2=(1-\\beta_b^2)^{-1}$. Meanwhile, when\nLWFA is modeled in the quasi-3D geometry in which the electromagnetic fields\nand current are decomposed into a limited number of azimuthal harmonics,\nspeedups are achieved by modeling three dimensional problems with the\ncomputation load on the order of two dimensional $r-z$ simulations. Here, we\ndescribe how to combine the speed ups from the Lorentz boosted frame and\nquasi-3D algorithms. The key to the combination is the use of a hybrid Yee-FFT\nsolver in the quasi-3D geometry that can be used to effectively eliminate the\nNumerical Cerenkov Instability (NCI) that inevitably arises in a Lorentz\nboosted frame due to the unphysical coupling of Langmuir modes and EM modes of\nthe relativistically drifting plasma in these simulations. In addition, based\non the space-time distribution of the LWFA data in the lab and boosted frame,\nwe propose to use a moving window to follow the drifting plasma to further\nreduce the computational load. We describe the details of how the NCI is\neliminated for the quasi-3D geometry, the setups for simulations which combine\nthe Lorentz boosted frame and quasi-3D geometry, the use of a moving window,\nand compare the results from these simulations against their corresponding lab\nframe cases. Good agreement is obtained, particularly when there is no\nself-trapping, which demonstrates it is possible to combine the Lorentz boosted\nframe and the quasi-3D algorithms when modeling LWFA to achieve unprecedented\nspeedups.\n", "  With the back-reaction of Hawking radiation taken into consideration, the\nwork of Kawai, Matsuo and Yokokura has shown that, under a few assumptions, the\ncollapse of matter does not lead to event horizon nor apparent horizon. In this\npaper, we relax their assumptions and elaborate on the space-time geometry of a\ngeneric collapsing body with spherical symmetry. The geometry outside the\ncollapsing sphere is found to be approximated by the geometry outside the\nwhite-hole horizon, hence the collapsing matter remains outside the\nSchwarzschild radius. As particles in Hawking radiation are created in the\nvicinity of the collapsing matter, the information loss paradox is alleviated.\nAssuming that the collapsing body evaporates within finite time, there is no\nevent horizon.\n", "  Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of sediment transport, particularly\nthose during the formation and evolution of bedforms, is of critical scientific\nimportance and has engineering relevance. Traditional approaches of sediment\ntransport simulations heavily rely on empirical models, which are not able to\ncapture the physics-rich, regime-dependent behaviors of the process. With the\nincrease of available computational resources in the past decade, CFD-DEM\n(computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) has emerged as a viable\nhigh-fidelity method for the study of sediment transport. However, a\ncomprehensive, quantitative study of the generation and migration of different\nsediment bed patterns using CFD-DEM is still lacking. In this work,\ncurrent-induced sediment transport problems in a wide range of regimes are\nsimulated, including 'flat bed in motion', `small dune', `vortex dune' and\nsuspended transport. Simulations are performed by using SediFoam, an\nopen-source, massively parallel CFD-DEM solver developed by the authors. This\nis a general-purpose solver for particle-laden flows tailed for particle\ntransport problems. Validation tests are performed to demonstrate the\ncapability of CFD-DEM in the full range of sediment transport regimes.\nComparison of simulation results with experimental and numerical benchmark data\ndemonstrates the merits of CFD-DEM approach. In addition, the improvements of\nthe present simulations over existing studies using CFD-DEM are presented. The\npresent solver gives more accurate prediction of sediment transport rate by\nproperly accounting for the influence of particle volume fraction on the fluid\nflow. In summary, this work demonstrates that CFD-DEM is a promising\nparticle-resolving approach for probing the physics of current-induced sediment\ntransport.\n", "  We study unitarity and renormalizability in the Lifshitz scalar field theory,\nwhich is characterized by an anisotropic scaling between the space and time\ndirections. Without the Lorentz symmetry, both the unitarity and the\nrenormalizability conditions are modified from those in relativistic theories.\nWe show that for renormalizability, an extended version of the power counting\ncondition is required in addition to the conventional one. The unitarity bound\nfor S-matrix elements also gives stronger constraints on interaction terms\nbecause of the reference frame dependence of scattering amplitudes. We prove\nthat both unitarity and renormalizability require identical conditions as in\nthe case of conventional relativistic theories.\n", "  We investigate adiabatic expansion of a charged and rotating fluid element\nconsisting of weakly interacting particles, which is initially perturbed by an\nexternal electromagnetic field. A framework for the perturbative calculation of\nthe non-equilibrium distribution function of this fluid volume is considered\nand the distribution function is calculated to the first order in the\nperturbative expansion. This distribution function, which describes the\nevolution of the element with constant entropy, allows to calculate momentum\nflux tensor and viscosity coefficients of the expanding system. We show, that\nthese viscosity coefficients depend on the initial angular velocity of the spot\nand on the strength of its initial perturbation by the external field. Obtained\nresults are applied to the phenomenology of the viscosity to the entropy ratio\ncalculated in lattice models.\n", "  We have studied the $N^*(2120)$, $\\Delta^*(1940)$, and the possible\n$\\Sigma^*(1380)$ resonances in the $\\gamma p \\to K^+ \\Lambda(1520)$, $pp \\to n\nK^+ \\Sigma(1385)$, and $\\Lambda p \\to \\Lambda p \\pi^0$ reactions within the\nresonance model and the effective Lagrangian approach. It is shown that when\nthe contributions from these baryonic states were considered, the current\nexperimental measurement could be well reproduced. In addition, we also\ndemonstrate that the angular distributions provide direct information of these\nreactions, which could be useful for the investigation of those states and may\nbe tested by future experiments.\n", "  Reflection positivity originates from one of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms\nfor constructive quantum field theory. It serves as a bridge between euclidean\nand relativistic quantum field theory. In mathematics, more specifically, in\nrepresentation theory, it is related to the Cartan duality of symmetric Lie\ngroups (Lie groups with an involution) and results in a transformation of a\nunitary representation of a symmetric Lie group to a unitary representation of\nits Cartan dual. In this article we continue our investigation of\nrepresentation theoretic aspects of reflection positivity by discussing\nreflection positive Markov processes indexed by Lie groups, measures on path\nspaces, and invariant gaussian measures in spaces of distribution vectors. This\nprovides new constructions of reflection positive unitary representations.\n", "  Synthetic data describing coherent random fluctuations have widely been used\nto validate numerical sim- ulations against experimental observations or to\nexamine the reliability of extracting statistical properties of plasma\nturbulence via correlation functions. Estimating correlation time or lengths\nbased on correlation functions implicitly assumes that the observed data are\nstationary and homogeneous. It is, therefore, impor- tant that synthetic data\nalso satisfy the stationary process and homogeneous state. Based on the\nsynthetic data with randomly generated moving Gaussian shaped fluctuations both\nin time and space, the correlation function depending on the size of averaging\ntime window is analytically derived. Then, the smallest possible spatial window\nsize of synthetic data satisfying the stationary process and homogeneous state\nis proposed, thereby reducing the computation time to generate proper synthetic\ndata and providing a constraint on the minimum size of simulation domains when\nusing synthetic diagnostics to compare with experiment. This window size is\nalso numerically confirmed with 1D synthetic data with various parameter scans.\n", "  Two magnetic phase transitions have been noted for SrCoO$_{3-y}$ for\nnear-stoichiometric oxygen concentrations (small y). Using muon spin rotation\nand neutron scattering experiments, we have established that the two\ntransitions represent separate, spatially distinct magnetic phases that coexist\nin a two-phase equilibrium mixture. The two phases most likely represent areas\nof the sample with different effective valence charge density. Further, the\nphases exist over regions with a length scale intermediate between nanoscale\ncharge inhomogeneity and systems such as manganites or super-oxygenated\ncuprates with large length scale phase separation.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) hopper flow of disks has been extensively studied. Here,\nwe investigate hopper flow of ellipses with aspect ratio $\\alpha = 2$, and we\ncontrast that behavior to the flow of disks. We use a quasi-2D hopper\ncontaining photoelastic particles to obtain stress/force information. We\nsimultaneously measure the particle motion and stress. We determine several\nproperties, including discharge rates, jamming probabilities, and the number of\nparticles in clogging arches. For both particle types, the size of the opening,\n$D$, relative to the size of particles, $\\ell$ is an important dimensionless\nmeasure. The orientation of the ellipses plays an important role in flow\nrheology and clogging. The alignment of contacting ellipses enhances the\nprobability of forming stable arches. This study offers insight for\napplications involving the flow of granular materials consisting of ellipsoidal\nshapes, and possibly other non-spherical shapes.\n", "  The paper aims to point out a novel geometric characterisation of the WDVV\nequations of 2D topological field theory.\n", "  We consider the precession of a Dirac particle spin in some anisotropic\nBianchi universes. This effect is present already in the Bianchi-I universe. We\ndiscuss in some detail the geodesics and the spin precession for both the\nKasner and the Heckmann-Schucking solutions. In the Bianchi-IX universe the\nspin precession acquires the chaotic character due to the stochasticity of the\noscillatory approach to the cosmological singularity. The related helicity flip\nof fermions in the very early Universe may produce the sterile particles\ncontributing to dark matter.\n", "  Resonances are extracted from a number of energy-dependent and single-energy\nfits to scattering data. The influence of recent, precise EPECUR data is\ninvestigated. Results for the single-energy fits are derived using the L+P\nmethod of analysis and are compared to those obtained using contour integration\napplied to the global energy-dependent fits.\n", "  We explore a time-dependent energy dissipation of the energetic electrons in\nthe inhomogeneous intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of cosmic\nreionization. In addition to the atomic processes we take into account the\nInverse Compton (IC) scattering of the electrons on the comic microwave\nbackground (CMB) photons, which is the dominant channel of energy loss for the\nelectrons with energies above a few MeV. We show that: (1) the effect on the\nIGM has both local (atomic processes) and non-local (IC radiation) components;\n(2) the energy distribution between Hydrogen and Helium ionizations depends on\nthe initial electron energy; (3) the local baryon overdensity significantly\naffects the fractions of energy distributed in each channel; and (4) the\nrelativistic effect of atomic cross section become important during the epoch\nof cosmic reionization. We release our code as open source for further\nmodification by the community.\n", "  The generalized Boole transformations have rich behavior ranging from the\n\\textit{mixing} phase with the Cauchy invariant measure to the\n\\textit{dissipative} phase through the \\textit{infinite ergodic} phase with the\nLebesgue measure. In this Letter, by giving the proof of mixing property for\n$0<\\alpha<1$ we show an \\textit{analytic} formula of the Lyapunov exponents\n$\\lambda$ which are explicitly parameterized in terms of the parameter $\\alpha$\nof the generalized Boole transformations for the whole region $\\alpha>0$ and\nbridge those three phase \\textit{continuously}. We found the different scale\nbehavior of the Lyapunov exponent near $\\alpha=1$ using analytic formula with\nthe parameter $\\alpha$. In particular, for $0<\\alpha<1$, we then prove an\nexistence of extremely sensitive dependency of Lyapunov exponents, where the\nabsolute values of the derivative of Lyapunov exponents with respect to the\nparameter $\\alpha$ diverge to infinity in the limit of $\\alpha\\to 0$, and\n$\\alpha \\to 1$. This result shows the computational complexity on the numerical\nsimulations of the Lyapunov exponents near $\\alpha \\simeq$ 0, 1.\n", "  We evaluate the $\\pi N$ compositeness of the $\\Delta (1232)$ resonance so as\nto clarify the internal structure of $\\Delta (1232)$ in terms of the $\\pi N$\ncomponent. Here the compositeness is defined as contributions from two-body\nwave functions to the normalization of the total wave function and is extracted\nfrom the $\\pi N$ scattering amplitude. In this study we employ the chiral\nunitary approach with the interaction up to the next-to-leading order plus a\nbare $\\Delta$ term in chiral perturbation theory and describe $\\Delta (1232)$\nin an elastic $\\pi N$ scattering. Fitting the $\\pi N$ scattering amplitude to\nthe solution of the partial wave analysis, we obtain a large real part of the\n$\\pi N$ compositeness for $\\Delta (1232)$ comparable to unity and\nnon-negligible imaginary part as well, with which we reconfirm the result in\nthe previous study on the $\\pi N$ compositeness for $\\Delta (1232)$.\n", "  Particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations are a productive and valued tool\nfor the study of nonlinear plasma phenomena, yet there are basic questions\nabout the simulation methods themselves that remain unanswered. Here we study\none such question: energy and momentum conservation by PIC. We employ both\nanalysis and simulations of one-dimensional, electrostatic plasmas to\nunderstand why PIC simulations are either energy or momentum conserving but not\nboth, what the role of numerical stability is in non-conservation, and how do\nerrors in conservation scale with the numerical parameters. Conserving both\nmomentum and energy make it possible to model problems such as Jeans' -type\nequilibria. Avoiding numerical instability is useful, but so is being able to\nidentify when its effect on the results may be important. Designing simulations\nto achieve the best possible accuracy with the least expenditure of effort\nrequires results on the scaling of error with the numerical parameters.. Our\nresults identify the central role of Gauss' law in conservation of both\nmomentum and energy, and the significant differences in numerical stability and\nerror scaling between energy-conserving and momentum-conserving simulations.\n", "  We present a novel experimental setup to investigate two-dimensional thermal\nconvection in a freestanding thin liquid film. We develop a setup for the\nreproducible generation of freestanding thin liquid films. Such films can be\nproduced in a controlled way on the scale of 5 to 1000 nanometers. Our primary\ngoal is to investigate the statistics of reversals in Rayleigh-B\\'enard\nconvection with varying aspect ratio; here numerical works are quite expensive\nand 3D experiments prohibitively complicated and costly. However, as well\nquestions regarding the physics of liquid films under controlled conditions can\nbe investigated, like surface forces, or stability under varying\nthermodynamical parameters. The thin liquid film has a well-defined and -chosen\nchemistry in order to fit our particular requirements, it has a thickness to\narea ratio of approximately 10^8 and is supported by a frame which is\nadjustable in height and width to vary the aspect ratio from 0.16 to 10. The\ntop and bottom frame elements can be set to specific temperature within T=\n15-55{\\deg}C. The ambient parameters of the thin film are carefully controlled\nto achieve reproducible results and allow a comparison to experimental and\nnumerical data.\n", "  At super-Eddington rates accretion flows onto black holes have been described\nas slim (aspect ratio $H/R \\lesssim 1$) or thick (H/R >1) discs, also known as\ntori or (Polish) doughnuts. The relation between the two descriptions has never\nbeen established, but it was commonly believed that at sufficiently high\naccretion rates slim discs inflate, becoming thick. We wish to establish under\nwhat conditions slim accretion flows become thick. We use analytical equations,\nnumerical 1+1 schemes, and numerical radiative MHD codes to describe and\ncompare various accretion flow models at very high accretion rates.We find that\nthe dominant effect of advection at high accretion rates precludes slim discs\nbecoming thick. At super-Eddington rates accretion flows around black holes can\nalways be considered slim rather than thick.\n", "  This work provides a detailed derivation of a generalized quantum\nFokker-Planck equation (GQFPE) appropriate for photo-induced quantum dynamical\nprocesses. The path integral method pioneered by Caldeira and Leggett (CL)\n[Caldeira and Leggett, Physica A 121, 587 (1983)] is extended for a\nnonequilibrium influence functional, which has been obtained for general cases\nwhere the ground and the excited electronic state baths can be different. Both\nnonequilibrium and non-Markovian effects are accounted for consistently by\nexpanding the paths in the exponents of the influence functional with respect\nto time up to the second order. This procedure results in approximations\ninvolving only single time integrations for the exponents of the influence\nfunctional but with additional time dependent boundary terms that have been\nignored in previous works. The boundary terms complicate the derivation of a\ntime evolution equation, but do not affect position dependent physical\nobservables or the dynamics in the steady state limit. For an effective density\noperator with the boundary terms factored out, a time evolution equation is\nderived through short time expansion of the effective action followed by\nGaussian integrations in analytically continued complex domain of space. This\nleads to a compact form of GQFPE with time dependent kernels and additional\nterms, which make the resulting equation the Dekker form [H. Dekker, Phys. Rep.\n80, 1 (1981)]. Major terms of the equation are analyzed for the case of Ohmic\nspectral density with Drude cutoff, which shows that the new GQFPE satisfies\nthe positive definiteness condition in medium to high temperature limit.\n", "  We examine the role of interactions for a Bose gas trapped in a double-well\npotential (\"Bose-Josephson junction\") when external noise is applied and the\nsystem is initially delocalized with equal probability amplitudes in both\nsites. The noise may have two kinds of effects: loss of atoms from the trap,\nand random shifts in the relative phase or number difference between the two\nwells. The effects of phase noise are mitigated by atom-atom interactions and\ntunneling, such that the dephasing rate may be reduced to half its single-atom\nvalue. Decoherence due to number noise (which induces fluctuations in the\nrelative atom number between the wells) is considerably enhanced by the\ninteractions. A similar scenario is predicted for the case of atom loss, even\nif the loss rates from the two sites are equal. In fact, interactions convert\nthe increased uncertainty in atom number (difference) into (relative) phase\ndiffusion and reduce the coherence across the junction. We examine the\nparameters relevant for these effects using a simple model of the trapping\npotential based on an atom chip device. These results provide a framework for\nmapping the dynamical range of barriers engineered for specific applications\nand sets the stage for more complex circuits (\"atomtronics\").\n", "  We review our recent efforts for determining resonance parameters associated\nwith light-quark baryons ($N^*$, $\\Delta^*$, $\\Lambda^*$, $\\Sigma^*$) through\ncomprehensive analyses of various meson production reactions off the nucleon\nwithin the ANL-Osaka dynamical coupled-channels approach.\n", "  A rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) would emit a continuous gravitational\nwave (GW) detectable by the advanced LIGO, advanced Virgo, KAGRA and proposed\nthird generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET). Such a GW does\nnot propagate freely, but is affected by the Coulomb-type gravitational field\nof the NS itself. This effect appears as a phase shift in the GW depending on\nthe NS mass. We have shown that mass of an isolated NS can, in principle, be\ndetermined if we could detect the continuous GW with two or more frequency\nmodes. Indeed, our Monte Carlo simulations have demonstrated that mass of a NS\nwith its ellipticity $10^{-6}$ at 1 kpc is typically measurable with precision\nof 20% using the ET, if the NS is precessing or has a pinned superfluid core\nand emits GWs with once and twice the spin frequencies. After briefly\nexplaining our idea and results, this paper concerns with the effect of\nmisalignment angle (\"wobble angle\" in the case of a precessing NS) on the mass\nmeasurement precision.\n", "  Given the best-fit results of six neutrino oscillation parameters, we plot\nthe Dirac and Majorana unitarity triangles (UTs) of the 3\\times 3 lepton flavor\nmixing matrix to show their real shapes for the first time. The connections of\nthe Majorana UTs with neutrino-antineutrino oscillations and neutrino decays\nare explored, and the possibilities of right or isosceles UTs are discussed. In\nthe neutrino mass limit of m_1 \\to 0 or m_3 \\to 0, which is allowed by current\nexperimental data, we show how the six triangles formed by the effective\nMajorana neutrino masses \\langle m\\rangle_{\\alpha\\beta} (for \\alpha, \\beta = e,\n\\mu, \\tau) and their corresponding component vectors look like in the complex\nplane. The relations of such triangles to the Majorana phases and to the\nlepton-number-violating decays H^{++} \\to \\alpha^+ \\beta^+ in the type-II\nseesaw mechanism are also illustrated.\n", "  Use of the effective Lagrangian incorporating both the scalar and\npseudoscalar mesons gives a possibility to calculate the $\\pi \\pi$-scattering\nlengths without attraction of the ChPT theory.\n", "  Quantum noise with exchange and tunneling is studied within time-dependent\nwave packets. A novel expression for the quantum noise of two identical\nparticles injected simultaneously from opposite sides of a tunneling barrier is\npresented. Such quantum noise expression provides a physical (non-spurious)\nexplanation for the experimental detection of two electrons at the same side\nunder static potentials. Numerical simulations of the two-particle scattering\nprobabilities in a double barrier potential with an oscillatory well are\nperformed. The dependence of the quantum noise on the electron energy and\noscillatory frequency are analyzed. The peculiar behaviour of the dependence of\nthe quantum noise on such parameters is proposed as a test about the soundness\nof this novel quantum noise expression, for either static or oscillatory\npotentials.\n", "  Archimedes is an INFN-funded pathfinder experiment aimed at verifying the\nfeasibility of measuring the interaction of vacuum fluctuations with gravity.\nThe final experiment will measure the force exerted by the gravitational field\non a Casimir cavity whose vacuum energy is modulated with a superconductive\ntransition, by using a balance as a small force detector. Archimedes is a\ntwo-year project devoted to test the most critical experimental aspects, in\nparticular the balance resonance frequency and quality factor, the thermal\nmodulation efficiency and the superconductive sample realization.\n", "  Bath engineering, which utilizes coupling to lossy modes in a quantum system\nto generate non-trivial steady states, is a tantalizing alternative to gate-\nand measurement-based quantum science. Here, we demonstrate dissipative\nstabilization of entanglement between two superconducting transmon qubits in a\nsymmetry-selective manner. We utilize the engineered symmetries of the\ndissipative environment to stabilize a target Bell state; we further\ndemonstrate suppression of the Bell state of opposite symmetry due to parity\nselection rules. This implementation is resource-efficient, achieves a\nsteady-state fidelity $\\mathcal{F} = 0.70$, and is scalable to multiple qubits.\n", "  Topological Skyrmions as intricate spin textures were observed experimentally\nin helimagnets on 2d plane. Theoretical foundation of such solitonic states to\nappear in pure ferromagnetic model, as exact solutions expressed through any\nanalytic function, was made long ago by Belavin and Polyakov (BP). We propose\nan innovative generalization of the BP solution for an anisotropic ferromagnet,\nbased on a physically motivated geometric (in-)equality, which takes the exact\nSkyrmion to a new class of functions beyond analyticity. The possibility of\nstabilizing such metastable states in helimagnets is discussed with the\nconstruction of individual Skyrmion and Skyrmion crystal with asymmetry, likely\nto be detected in precision experiments.\n", "  We present the recent developments in the studies of the structure of hadron\nresonances, focusing on the compositeness in terms of the hadronic degrees of\nfreedom. We discuss the model dependence of the compositeness, and show that\nthe structure of the near-threshold bound states and resonances is\nmodel-independently determined. The applications to various hadrons are\nsummarized.\n", "  The Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity (CSLTG) are formulated at first\norder formalism. In this formalism, the derivation of the entropy of a black\nhole on bifurcation surface, as a quasi-local conserved charge is problematic.\nIn this paper we overcome to these problems by considering the concept of total\nvariation and the Lorentz-Lie derivative. We firstly find an expression for the\nADT conserved current in the context of the CSLTG which is based on the concept\nof the Killing vector fields. Then, we generalize it to be conserved for all\ndiffeomorphism generators. Thus, we can extract an off-shell conserved charge\nfor any vector field which generates a diffeomorphism. The formalism presented\nhere is based on the concept of quasi-local conserved charges which are\noff-shell. The charges can be calculated on any codimension two space-like\nsurface surrounding a black hole and the results are independent of the chosen\nsurface. By using the off-shell quasi-local conserved charge, we investigate\nthe Virasoro algebra and find a formula to calculate the central extension\nterm. We apply the formalism to the BTZ black hole solution in the context of\nthe Einstein gravity and the Generalized massive gravity, then we find the\neigenvalues of their Virasoro generators as well as the corresponding central\ncharges. Eventually, we calculate the entropy of the BTZ black hole by the\nCardy formula and we show that the result exactly matches with the one obtained\nby the concept of the off-shell conserved charges.\n", "  Planets emit thermal radiation and reflect incident light that they recieve\nfrom their host stars. As a planet orbits it's host star the photometric\nvariations associated with these two effects produce very similar phase curves.\nIf observed through only a single bandpass this leads to a degeneracy between\ncertain planetary parameters that hinder the precise characterization of such\nplanets. However, observing the same planet through two different bandpasses\ngives one much more information about the planet. Here, we develop a Bayesian\nmethodology for combining photometry from both \\emph{Kepler} and the Transiting\nExoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). In addition, we demonstrate via simulations\nthat one can disentangle the reflected and thermally emitted light from the\natmosphere of a hot-Jupiter as well as more precisely constrain both the\ngeometric albedo and dayside temperature of the planet. This methodology can\nfurther be employed using various combinations of photometry from the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST), the Characterizing ExOplanet Satellite (CHEOPS),\nor the PLATO mission.\n", "  We develop a dynamical coupled-channels (DCC) model for neutrino-nucleon\nreactions in the resonance region, by extending the DCC model that we have\npreviously developed through an analysis of $\\pi N, \\gamma N\\to \\pi N, \\eta N,\nK\\Lambda, K\\Sigma$ reaction data for $W\\le 2.1$ GeV. We analyze\nelectron-induced reaction data for both proton and neutron targets to determine\nthe vector current form factors up to $Q^2\\le$ 3.0 (GeV/$c$)$^2$. Axial-current\nmatrix elements are derived in accordance with the Partially Conserved Axial\nCurrent (PCAC) relation to the $\\pi N$ interactions of the DCC model. As a\nresult, we can uniquely determine the interference pattern between resonant and\nnon-resonant amplitudes. Our calculated cross sections for neutrino-induced\nsingle-pion productions are compared with available data, and are found to be\nin reasonable agreement with the data. We also calculate the double-pion\nproduction cross sections in the resonance region, for the first time, with\nrelevant resonance contributions and channel couplings. The result is compared\nwith the double-pion production data. For a future development of a\nneutrino-nucleus reaction model and/or a neutrino event generator for analyses\nof neutrino experiments, the DCC model presented here can give a useful input.\n", "  Conceptual climate models provide an approach to understanding climate\nprocesses through a mathematical analysis of an approximation to reality.\nRecently, these models have also provided interesting examples of nonsmooth\ndynamical systems. Here we discuss a conceptual model of glacial cycles\nconsisting of a system of three ordinary differential equations defining a\ndiscontinuous vector field. We show that this system has a large periodic orbit\ncrossing the discontinuity boundary. This orbit can be interpreted as an\nintrinsic cycling of the Earth's climate giving rise to alternating glaciations\nand deglaciations.\n", "  We define classes of quantum states associated to isotropic submanifolds of\ncotangent bundles. The classes are stable under the action of semiclassical\npseudo-differential operators and covariant under the action of semiclassical\nFourier integral operators. We develop a semiclassical symbol calculus for\nthem; the symbols are symplectic spinors. We outline various applications.\n", "  The Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Model provides a framework able to encompass\nseveral physical processes and gives a unfied description of these in an energy\nrange extending up to the $\\phi$ mass. Supplied with appropriate symmetry\nbreaking schemes, the HLS Model gives a broken Effective Lagrangian (BHLS). The\nBHLS Lagrangian gives rise to a fit procedure in which a simultaneous\ndescription of the $e^+ e^-$ annihilations to $\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $\\pi^0 \\gamma$,\n$\\eta \\gamma$, $\\pi^+\\pi^- \\pi^0$, $K^+ K^-$, $K_L K_S$ and of the dipion\nspectrum in the decay $\\tau^\\pm \\rightarrow \\pi^\\pm \\pi^0 \\nu$ can be\nperformed.\n  Supplemented with a few pieces of information on the $\\rho^0-\\omega-\\phi$\nsystem, the $\\tau$ dipion spectrum is shown to predict accurately the pion form\nfactor in $e^+ e^-$ annihilations. Physics results derived from global fits\ninvolving or excluding the $\\tau$ dipion spectra are found consistent with each\nothers. Therefore, no obvious mismatch between the $\\tau$ and $e^+e^- $ physics\nproperties arises and the $\\tau-e^+e^- $ puzzle vanishes within the broken HLS\nModel.\n", "  Lattice models of fermions, bosons, and spins have long served to elucidate\nthe essential physics of quantum phase transitions in a variety of systems.\nGeneralizing such models to incorporate driving and dissipation has opened new\nvistas to investigate nonequilibrium phenomena and dissipative phase\ntransitions in interacting many-body systems. We present a framework for the\ntreatment of such open quantum lattices based on a resummation scheme for the\nLindblad perturbation series. Employing a convenient diagrammatic\nrepresentation, we utilize this method to obtain relevant observables for the\nopen Jaynes-Cummings lattice, a model of special interest for open-system\nquantum simulation. We demonstrate that the resummation framework allows us to\nreliably predict observables for both finite and infinite Jaynes-Cummings\nlattices with different lattice geometries. The resummation of the Lindblad\nperturbation series can thus serve as a valuable tool in validating open\nquantum simulators, such as circuit-QED lattices, currently being investigated\nexperimentally.\n", "  As a potential building block for the next generation of devices or\nmultifunctional materials that are spreading almost every technology sector,\none-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterial has received intensive research\ninterests. Recently, a new ultra-thin diamond nanothread (DNT) has joined this\npalette, which is a 1D structure with poly-benzene sections connected by\nStone-Wales (SW) transformation defects. Using large-scale molecular dynamics\nsimulations, we found that this sp3 bonded DNT can transit from a brittle to a\nductile characteristic by varying the length of the poly-benzene sections,\nsuggesting that DNT possesses entirely different mechanical responses than\nother 1D carbon allotropies. Analogously, the SW defects behave like a grain\nboundary that interrupts the consistency of the poly-benzene sections. For a\nDNT with a fixed length, the yield strength fluctuates in the vicinity of a\ncertain value and is independent of the \"grain size\". On the other hand, both\nyield strength and yield strain show a clear dependence on the total length of\nDNT, which is due to the fact that the failure of the DNT is dominated by the\nSW defects. Its highly tunable ductility together with its ultra-light density\nand high Young's modulus makes diamond nanothread ideal for creation of\nextremely strong three-dimensional nano-architectures.\n", "  Vortices symmetric with respect to simultaneous parity and time reversing\ntransformations are considered on the square lattice in the framework of the\ndiscrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. The existence and stability of\nvortex configurations is analyzed in the limit of weak coupling between the\nlattice sites, when predictions on the elementary cell of a square lattice\n(i.e., a single square) can be extended to a large (yet finite) array of\nlattice cells. Our analytical predictions are found to be in good agreement\nwith numerical computations.\n", "  We develop in detail a graphical tensor product reduction scheme, first\ndescribed by Antoine and Speiser, for the simple rank 2 Lie algebras so(5) =\nsp(2), su(3), and g(2). This leads to an efficient practical method to reduce\ntensor products of irreducible representations into sums of such\nrepresentations. For this purpose, the 2-dimensional weight diagram of a given\nrepresentation is placed in a \"landscape\" of irreducible representations. We\nprovide both the landscapes and the weight diagrams for a large number of\nrepresentations for the three simple rank 2 Lie algebras. We also apply the\nalgebraic \"girdle\" method, which is much less efficient for calculations by\nhand for moderately large representations. Computer code for reducing tensor\nproducts, based on the graphical method, has been developed as well and is\navailable from the authors upon request.\n", "  Induced by the Hagedorn instability, weakly-coupled $U(N)$ gauge theories on\na compact manifold exhibit a confinement/deconfinement phase transition in the\nlarge-$N$ limit. Recently we discover that the thermal entropy of a free theory\non $\\mathbb{S}^3$ gets reduced by a universal constant term, $-N^2/4$, compared\nto that from completely deconfined colored states. This entropy deficit is due\nto the persistence of Gauss's law, and actually independent of the shape of the\nmanifold. In this paper we show that this universal term can be identified as\nthe topological entangle entropy both in the corresponding $4+1 D$ bulk theory\nand the dimensionally reduced theory. First, entanglement entropy in the bulk\ntheory contains the so-called \"particle\" contribution on the entangling\nsurface, which naturally gives rise to an area-law term. The topological term\nresults from the Gauss's constraint of these surface states. Secondly, the\nhigh-temperature limit also defines a dimensionally reduced theory. We\ncalculate the geometric entropy in the reduced theory explicitly, and find that\nit is given by the same constant term after subtracting the leading term of\n${\\mathcal O}(\\beta^{-1})$. The two procedures are then applied to the\nconfining phase, by extending the temperature to the complex plane.\nGeneralizing the recently proposed $2D$ modular description to an arbitrary\nmatter content, we show the leading local term is missing and no topological\nterm could be definitely isolated. For the special case of ${\\mathcal N}=4$\nsuper Yang-Mills theory, the results obtained here are compared with that at\nstrong coupling from the holographic derivation.\n", "  Using the standard Lagrangian of gluons and a model of dual superconductor\nfor magnetic monopoles, we calculate the number densities of the gluons and\nmonopoles produced by the decay of background color electric $E$ and magnetic\n$B$ fields ( glasma ). We find that gluons are dominant decay products when the\ninitial values of the gauge fields are large such that\n$gE=gB>(0.5\\mbox{GeV})^2$, while they are suppressed and monopoles are dominant\ndecay products when the initial values are small such that\n$gE=gB<(0.4\\mbox{GeV})^2$. The feature of the gluon dominance at large $gE=gB$\nand the monopole dominance at small $gE=gB$ is similar to the one of\nthermalized quark gluon monopole plasmas proposed recently, if we identify\n$\\sqrt{gE}=\\sqrt{gB}$ as temperatures of the plasmas. Although the model of the\nmonopoles is phenomenological, our analysis suggests that the monopoles play\nimportant roles in the decay of the glasmas with small saturation momenta, to\nwhich classical statistical field theories are not applicable.\n", "  We propose a method to simultaneously correct linear optics errors and linear\ncoupling for storage rings using turn-by-turn (TbT) beam position monitor (BPM)\ndata. The independent component analysis (ICA) method is used to isolate the\nbetatron normal modes from the measured TbT BPM data. The betatron amplitudes\nand phase advances of the projections of the normal modes on the horizontal and\nvertical planes are then extracted, which, combined with dispersion\nmeasurement, are used to fit the lattice model. The fitting results are used\nfor lattice correction. The method has been successfully demonstrated on the\nNSLS-II storage ring.\n", "  The phenomenology of the emission of pulsars and magnetars depends\ndramatically on the structure and properties of their magnetic field. In\nparticular it is believed that the outbursting and flaring activity observed in\nAXPs and SRGs is strongly related to their internal magnetic field. Recent\nobservations have moreover shown that charges are present in their\nmagnetospheres supporting the idea that their magnetic field is tightly twisted\nin the vicinity of the star. In principle these objects offer a unique\nopportunity to investigate physics in a regime beyond what can be obtained in\nthe laboratory. We will discuss the properties of equilibrium models of\nmagnetized neutron stars, and we will show how internal and external currents\ncan be related. These magnetic field configurations will be discussed\nconsidering also their stability, relevant for their origin and possibly\nconnected to events like SNe and GRBs. We will also show what kind of\ndeformations they induce in the star, that could lead to emission of\ngravitational waves. In the case of a twisted magnetosphere we will show how\nthe amount of twist regulates their general topology. A general formalism based\non the simultaneous numerical solution of the general relativistic\nGrad-Shafranov equation and Einstein equations will be presented.\n", "  Gibbs' thermodynamic entropy is given by the logarithm of the phase volume,\nwhich itself responds to heat transfer to and from thermal reservoirs. We\ncompare the thermodynamic dissipation described by phase-volume loss with\nheat-transfer entropy production. Their equivalence is documented for computer\nsimulations of the response of an ergodic harmonic oscillator to thermostated\ntemperature gradients. In the simulations one or two thermostat variables\ncontrol the kinetic energy or the kinetic energy and its fluctuation. All of\nthe motion equations are time-reversible. We consider both strong and weak\ncontrol variables. In every case the time-averaged dissipative loss of\nphase-space volume coincides with the entropy produced by heat transfer. Linear\nresponse theory nicely reproduces the small-gradient results obtained by\ncomputer simulation. The thermostats considered here are ergodic and provide\nsimple dynamical models, some of them with as few as three ordinary\ndifferential equations, while remaining capable of reproducing Gibbs' canonical\nphase-space distribution and precisely consistent with irreversible\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We discuss some aspects of dark matter phenomenology, in particular related\nto Direct detection and collider searches, of models in which a fermionic Dark\nMatter interacts with SM fermions through spin 1 mediators. Contrary to\nconventional simplified models we will consider fixed assignments of the\ncouplings of the ($Z^{'}$) mediator, according theoretically motivated\nembeddings. This allows to predict signals at future experimental facilities\nwhich can be used to test and possibly discriminate different realizations.\n", "  Compared with the deuterium tritium (DT) fusion, the environmentally clean\nfusion of protons with 11B is extremely difficult. When instead of nanosecond\nlaser pulses for thermal-ablating driven ignition, picosecond pulses are used,\na drastic change by nonlinearity results in ultrahigh acceleration of plasma\nblocks. This radically changes to economic boron fusion by a measured new\navalanche ignition.\n", "  We derive an unbiased information theoretic energy landscape for chromosomes\nat metaphase using a maximum entropy approach that accurately reproduces the\ndetails of the experimentally measured pair-wise contact probabilities between\ngenomic loci. Dynamical simulations using this landscape lead to cylindrical,\nhelically twisted structures reflecting liquid crystalline order. These\nstructures are similar to those arising from a generic ideal homogenized\nchromosome energy landscape. The helical twist can be either right or left\nhanded so chiral symmetry is broken spontaneously. The ideal chromosome\nlandscape when augmented by interactions like those leading to topologically\nassociating domain (TAD) formation in the interphase chromosome reproduces\nthese behaviors. The phase diagram of this landscape shows the helical fiber\norder and the cylindrical shape persist at temperatures above the onset of\nchiral symmetry breaking which is limited by the TAD interaction strength.\n", "  We studied the electronic and magnetic dynamics of ferromagnetic insulating\nBaFeO3 thin films by using pump-probe time-resolved resonant x-ray reflectivity\nat the Fe 2p edge. By changing the excitation density, we found two distinctly\ndifferent types of demagnetization with a clear threshold behavior. We assigned\nthe demagnetization change from slow (~ 150 ps) to fast (< 70 ps) to a\ntransition into a metallic state induced by laser excitation. These results\nprovide a novel approach for locally tuning magnetic dynamics. In analogy to\nheat assisted magnetic recording, metallization can locally tune the\nsusceptibility for magnetic manipulation, allowing to spatially encode magnetic\ninformation.\n", "  In the present paper, we are concerned with the general localized solutions\nfor the complex short pulse equation including soliton, breather and rogue wave\nsolutions. With the aid of a generalized Darboux transformation, we construct\nthe $N$-bright soliton solution in a compact determinant form, then the\n$N$-breather solution including the Akhmediev breather and a general higher\norder rogue wave solution. The first- and second-order rogue wave solutions are\ngiven explicitly and illustrated by graphs. The asymptotic analysis is\nperformed rigorously for both the $N$-soliton and the $N$-breather solutions.\nAll three forms of the localized solutions admit either smoothed-, cusped- or\nlooped-type ones for the CSP equation depending on the parameters. It is noted\nthat, due to the reciprocal (hodograph) transformation, the rogue wave solution\nto the CSP equation is different from the one to the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\n(NLS) equation, which could be a cusponed- or a looped one.\n", "  This paper presents a new major release of the program FIESTA (Feynman\nIntegral Evaluation by a Sector decomposiTion Approach). The new release is\nmainly aimed at optimal performance at large scales when one is increasing the\nnumber of sampling points in order to reduce the uncertainty estimates. The\nrelease now supports graphical processor units (GPU) for the numerical\nintegration, methods to optimize cluster-usage, as well as other speed, memory,\nand stability improvements.\n", "  We present procedures based on Bayesian statistics for estimating, from data,\nthe parameters of effective field theories (EFTs). The extraction of low-energy\nconstants (LECs) is guided by theoretical expectations in a quantifiable way\nthrough the specification of Bayesian priors. A prior for natural-sized LECs\nreduces the possibility of overfitting, and leads to a consistent accounting of\ndifferent sources of uncertainty. A set of diagnostic tools are developed that\nanalyze the fit and ensure that the priors do not bias the EFT parameter\nestimation. The procedures are illustrated using representative model problems,\nincluding the extraction of LECs for the nucleon mass expansion in SU(2) chiral\nperturbation theory from synthetic lattice data.\n", "  Polarization arising from aligned dust grains presents a unique opportunity\nto study magnetic fields in the diffuse interstellar medium and molecular\nclouds. Polarization from circumstellar regions, accretion disks and comet\natmospheres can also be related to aligned dust.To reliably trace magnetic\nfields quantitative theory of grain alignment is required. Formulating the\ntheory that would correspond to observations was one of the longstanding\nproblems in astrophysics. Lately this problem has been successfully addressed,\nand in this review we summarize some of the most important theoretical advances\nin the theory of grain alignment by radiative torques (RATs) that act on\nrealistic irregular dust grains. We discuss an analytical model of RATs and the\nways to make RAT alignment more efficient, e.g. through paramagnetic relaxation\nwhen grains have inclusions with strong magnetic response. For very small\ngrains for which RAT alignment is inefficient, we also discuss paramagnetic\nrelaxation and a process termed resonance relaxation. We provide an extensive\nanalysis of the observational tests of grain alignment theory.\n", "  Aggregation of like-charged polymers is widely observed in biological and\nsoft matter systems. In many systems, bundles are formed when a short-range\nattraction of diverse physical origin like charge-bridging, hydrogen-bonding or\nhydrophobic interaction, overcomes the longer- range charge repulsion. In this\nLetter, we present a general mechanism of bundle formation in these systems as\nthe breaking of the translational invariance in parallel aligned polymers with\ncompeting interactions of this type. We derive a criterion for finite-sized\nbundle formation as well as for macroscopic phase separation (formation of\ninfinite bundles).\n", "  We discuss neutrino mass and mixing in the framework of the classic seesaw\nmechanism, involving right-handed neutrinos with large Majorana masses, which\nprovides an appealing way to understand the smallness of neutrino masses.\nHowever, with many input parameters, the seesaw mechanism is in general not\npredictive. We focus on natural implementations of the seesaw mechanism, in\nwhich large cancellations do not occur, where one of the right handed neutrinos\nis dominantly responsible for the atmospheric neutrino mass, while a second\nright-handed neutrino accounts for the solar neutrino mass, leading to an\neffective two right-handed neutrino model. We discuss recent attempts to\npredict lepton mixing and CP violation within such natural frameworks,\nfocussing on the Littlest Seesaw and its distinctive predictions.\n", "  In this proceeding we present predictions of the effective Majorana mass\n$|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ in neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay for the standard $3\\nu$\nmixing case and for the 3+1 neutrino mixing case indicated by the\nshort-baseline anomalies. We have taken into account the uncertainties of the\nneutrino mixing parameters determined by oscillation experiments. We obtained\nthat the predictions for $|m_{\\beta\\beta}|$ in the cases of $3\\nu$ and 3+1\nmixing are quite different, in agreement with previous discussions in the\nliterature, and that future measurements of neutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay\nand the total mass of the three lightest neutrinos in cosmological experiments\nmay distinguish the $3\\nu$ and 3+1 cases if the mass ordering is determined by\noscillation experiments.\n", "  The modern theory of the atomic nucleus results from the merging of the\nliquid drop (Niels Bohr and Fritz Kalckar) and of the shell model (Marie\nGoeppert Meyer and Axel Jensen), which contributed the concepts of collective\nexcitations and of independent-particle motion respectively. The unification of\nthese apparently contradictory views in terms of the particle-vibration\n(rotation) coupling (Aage Bohr and Ben Mottelson) has allowed for an ever\nincreasingly complete, accurate and detailed description of the nuclear\nstructure, Nuclear Field Theory (NFT, developed by the Copenhagen-Buenos Aires\ncollaboration) providing a powerful quantal embodiment. In keeping with the\nfact that reactions are not only at the basis of quantum mechanics (statistical\ninterpretation, Max Born) , but also the specific tools to probe the atomic\nnucleus, NFT is being extended to deal with processes which involve the\ncontinuum in an intrinsic fashion, so as to be able to treat them on an equal\nfooting with those associated with discrete states (nuclear structure). As a\nresult, spectroscopic studies of transfer to continuum states could eventually\nuse at profit the NFT rules, extended to take care of recoil effects. In the\npresent contribution we review the implementation of the NFT program of\nstructure and reactions, setting special emphasis on open problems and\noutstanding predictions.\n", "  Motor-proteins are responsible for transport inside cells. Harnessing their\nactivity is key towards developing new nano-technologies, or functional\nbiomaterials. Cytoskeleton-like networks, recently tailored in vitro, result\nfrom the self-assembly of subcellular autonomous units. Taming this biological\nactivity bottom-up may thus require molecular level alterations compromising\nprotein integrity. Taking a top-down perspective, here we prove that the\nseemingly chaotic flows of a tubulin-kinesin active gel can be forced to adopt\nwell-defined spatial directions by tuning the anisotropic viscosity of a\ncontacting lamellar oil. Different configurations of the active material are\nrealized, when the passive oil is either unforced or commanded by a magnetic\nfield. The inherent instability of the extensile active fluid is thus spatially\nregularized, leading to organized flow patterns, endowed with characteristic\nlength and time scales. Our finding paves the way for designing hybrid\nactive/passive systems where ATP-driven dynamics can be externally conditioned.\n", "  We investigate dual realizations of non--commutative spaces of Lie algebra\ntype in terms of formal power series in the Weyl algebra. To each realization\nof a Lie algebra $\\g$ we associate a star--product on the symmetric algebra\n$S(\\g)$ and an ordering on the enveloping algebra $U(\\g)$. Dual realizations of\n$\\g$ are defined in terms of left--right duality of the star--products on\n$S(\\g)$. It is shown that the dual realizations are related to an extension\nproblem for $\\g$ by shift operators whose action on $U(\\g)$ describes left and\nright shift of the generators of $U(\\g)$ in a given monomial. Using properties\nof the extended algebra, in the Weyl symmetric ordering we derive closed form\nexpressions for the dual realizations of $\\g$ in terms of two generating\nfunctions for the Bernoulli numbers. The theory is illustrated by considering\nthe $\\kappa$--deformed space.\n", "  We derive expressions for the expectation values of the local energy and the\nlocal power transferred by an external electrical field to a many-particle\nsystem of interacting spinless electrons. In analogy with the definition of the\n(local) presence and current probability densities, we construct a local energy\noperator such that the time-rate of change of its expectation value provides\ninformation on the spatial distribution of power. Results are presented as\nfunctions of an arbitrarily small volume $\\Omega$, and physical insights are\ndiscussed by means of the quantum hydrodynamical representation of the\nwavefunction, which is proven to allow for a clear-cut separation into\ncontributions with and without classical correspondence. Quantum features of\nthe local power are mainly manifested through the presence of non-local\nsources/sinks of power and through the action of forces with no classical\ncounterpart. Many-particle classical-like effects arise in the form of\ncurrent-force correlations and through the inflow/outflow of energy across the\nboundaries of the volume $\\Omega$. Interestingly, such intriguing features are\nonly reflected in the expression for the local power when the volume $\\Omega$\nis finite. Otherwise, for closed systems with $\\Omega \\to \\infty$, we recover a\nclassical-like single-particle expression.\n", "  While the LHC did not observe direct evidence for physics beyond the standard\nmodel, indirect hints for new physics were uncovered in the flavour sector in\nthe decays $B\\to K^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $B\\to K\\mu^+\\mu^-/B\\to Ke^+e^-$,\n$B_s\\to\\phi\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and $h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$. Each\nobservable deviates from the SM predictions at the $2-3\\,\\sigma$ level only,\nbut combining all $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ data via a global fit, one finds\n$4-5\\,\\sigma$ difference for NP compared to the SM and combining $B\\to\nD^{*}\\tau\\nu$ with $B\\to D\\tau\\nu$ one obtains $3.9\\,\\sigma$. While $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and $h\\to\\tau\\mu$ can be naturally explained by an extended\nHiggs sector, the $b\\to s\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomalies point at a $Z'$ gauge boson.\nHowever, it is also possible to explain $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ and $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ simultaneously with leptoquarks while their effect in\n$h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$ is far too small to account for current data. Combining a\n2HDM with a gauged $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ symmetry allows for explaining the $b\\to\ns\\mu^+\\mu^-$ anomalies in combination with $h\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$, predicting\ninteresting correlations with $\\tau\\to3\\mu$. In the light of these deviations\nfrom the SM we also discuss the possibilities of observing lepton flavour\nviolating $B$ decays (e.g. $B\\to K^{(*)}\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$ and\n$B_s\\to\\tau^\\pm\\mu^\\mp$).\n", "  Proximity effect in a mechanically exfoliated Bi1.95Sb0.05Se3 topological\ninsulator (TI) single crystal partially covered with disordered superconducting\n(SC) Mo thin film is reported. Magnetotransport measurement was performed\nsimultaneously across three different regions of the sample viz. SC, TI and\nSC/TI junction. Resistance measured across SC shows a TC at 4.3 K concomitantly\nthe resistance measurement on TI showed a metallic trend with a steep upturn at\nTC. Magneto-resistance (MR) measurement on TI exhibit a positive MR with\nShubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations, whereas on SC a positive MR superimposed\nwith steep cusp close to TC is observed. Across SC/TI junction both SdH\noscillation and the cusp were observed. The frequency of SdH oscillation on\nSC/TI junction is found to be lesser (~ 125 T) as compared to a reference\nBi1.95Sb0.05Se3sample (~ 174 T). Upper critical field HC2 deduced from WHH fit\nwas found to be 17.14 T for a reference Mo film whereas Mo film deposited on TI\nshowed a decreased HC2 of 4.05 T. The coherence length for the former was found\nto be 4.38 nm and for the latter 9.01 nm. The interaction between the spin-less\nCooper pairs in SC with the spin-momentum locked carriers on the surface of TI\nis believed to cause such changes in transport properties.\n", "  The interaction between the surface of a 3D topological insulator and a\nskyrmion / anti-skyrmion structure is studied in order to investigate the\npossibility of electron confinement due to skyrmion presence. Both hedgehog\n(N\\'eel) and vortex (Bloch) skyrmions are considered. For the hedgehog skyrmion\nthe in-plane components cannot be disregarded and their interaction with the\nsurface state of the TI has to be taken into account. A semi-classical\ndescription of the skyrmion chiral angle is obtained using the variational\nprinciple. It is shown that both the hedgehog and the vortex skyrmion can\ninduce bound states on the surface of the TI. However, the number and the\nproperties of these states depend strongly on the skyrmion type and on the\nskyrmion topological number $N_{Sk}$. The probability densities of the bound\nelectrons are also derived where it is shown that they are localized within the\nskyrmion region.\n", "  The spatial distribution of income shapes the structure and organisation of\ncities and its understanding has broad societal implications. Despite an\nabundant literature, many issues remain unclear. In particular, all definitions\nof segregation are implicitely tied to a single indicator, usually rely on an\nambiguous definition of income classes, without any consensus on how to define\nneighbourhoods and to deal with the polycentric organization of large cities.\nIn this paper, we address all these questions within a unique conceptual\nframework. We avoid the challenge of providing a direct definition of\nsegregation and instead start from a definition of what segregation is not.\nThis naturally leads to the measure of representation that is able to identify\nlocations where categories are over- or underrepresented. From there, we\nprovide a new measure of exposure that discriminates between situations where\ncategories co-locate or repel one another. We then use this feature to provide\nan unambiguous, parameter-free method to find meaningful breaks in the income\ndistribution, thus defining classes. Applied to the 2014 American Community\nSurvey, we find 3 emerging classes -- low, middle and higher income -- out of\nthe original 16 income categories. The higher-income households are\nproportionally more present in larger cities, while lower-income households are\nnot, invalidating the idea of an increased social polarisation. Finally, using\nthe density -- and not the distance to a center which is meaningless in\npolycentric cities -- we find that the richer class is overrepresented in high\ndensity zones, especially for larger cities. This suggests that density is a\nrelevant factor for understanding the income structure of cities and might\nexplain some of the differences observed between US and European cities.\n", "  We present first-principles calculations of the vibrational properties of the\ntransition metal dichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$ for various thicknesses in the\nhigh-temperature (undistorted) phase and the low-temperature commensurate\ncharge density wave (CDW) phase. We also present measurements of the Raman\nspectra for bulk, few-layer, and monolayer samples at temperatures well below\nthat of the bulk transition to the commensurate phase. Through our\ncalculations, we identify the low-frequency folded-back acoustic modes as a\nconvenient signature of the commensurate CDW wave structure in vibrational\nspectra. In our measured Raman spectra, this signature is clearly evident in\nall of the samples, indicating that the commensurate phase remains the ground\nstate as the material is thinned, even down to a single layer. This is in\ncontrast to some previous studies which suggest a suppression of the\ncommensurate CDW transition in thin flakes. We also use polarized Raman\nspectroscopy to probe c-axis orbital texture in the low-T phase, which has\nrecently been suggested as playing a role in the metal-insulator transition\nthat accompanies the structural transition to the commensurate CDW phase.\n", "  I present a new data driven update of the hadronic vacuum polarization\neffects for the muon and the electron $g-2$. For the leading order\ncontributions I find $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{had}(1)}=(686.99\\pm 4.21)[687.19\\pm\n3.48]\\times 10^{-10}$ based on $e^+e^-$data [incl. $\\tau$ data],\n$a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{had}(2)}= (-9.934\\pm 0.091) \\times 10^{-10}$ (NLO) and\n$a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{had}(3)}= (1.226\\pm 0.012) \\times 10^{-10}$ (NNLO) for the\nmuon, and $a_e^{\\mathrm{had}(1)}=(184.64\\pm 1.21)\\times 10^{-14}$ (LO),\n$a_e^{\\mathrm{had}(2)}=(-22.10\\pm 0.14)\\times 10^{-14}$ (NLO) and\n$a_e^{\\mathrm{had}(3)}=(2.79\\pm 0.02)\\times 10^{-14}$ (NNLO) for the electron.\nA problem with vacuum polarization undressing of cross-sections (time-like\nregion) is addressed. I also add a comment on properly including axial mesons\nin the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution. My estimate here reads\n$a_\\mu[a_1,f_1',f_1] \\sim ({ 7.51 \\pm 2.71}) \\times 10^{-11}\\,.$ With these\nupdates $a_\\mu^{\\rm exp}-a_\\mu^{\\rm the}=(32.73\\pm 8.15)\\times 10^{-10}$ a 4.0\n$\\sigma$ deviation, while $a_e^{\\rm exp}-a_e^{\\rm the}=(-1.10\\pm 0.82)\\times\n10^{-12}$ shows no significant deviation.\n", "  We report the measurement of K$^-$ absorption processes in the $\\Sigma^0$p\nfinal state and the first exclusive measurement of the two nucleon absorption\n(2NA) with the KLOE detector. The 2NA process without further interactions is\nfound to be 12\\% of the sum of all other contributing processes, including\nabsorption on three and more nucleons or 2NA followed by final state\ninteractions with the residual nucleons. We also determine the possible\ncontribution of the ppK$^-$ bound state to the $\\Sigma^0$p final state. A yield\nof ppK$^- /\\mathrm{K^-_{stop}}$ is found to be $(0.044 \\pm 0.009\\, stat ^{+\n0.004} _{- 0.005} \\,syst) \\cdot 10^{-2}$ but its statistical significance based\non an F-test is only 1$\\sigma$.\n", "  We give a quantitative analysis of the dynamical properties of fermionic cold\natomic gases in normal phase, such as the shear viscosity, heat conductivity,\nand viscous relaxation times, using the novel microscopic expressions derived\nby the renormalization group (RG) method, where the Boltzmann equation is\nfaithfully solved to extract the hydrodynamics without recourse to any ansatz.\nIn particular, we examine the quantum statistical effects, temperature\ndependence, and scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients and\nthe viscous relaxation times. The numerical calculation shows that the relation\n$\\tau_\\pi=\\eta/P$, which is derived in the relaxation-time approximation (RTA)\nand is used in most of the literature, turns out to be satisfied quite well,\nwhile the similar relation for the viscous relaxation time $\\tau_J$ of the heat\nconductivity is satisfied only approximately with a considerable error.\n", "  We analyze condition of orthogonality between optical Schrodinger\ncat-like-states constructed as superposition of two coherent states. We show\nthat the orthogonality condition leads to quantization of values of a naturally\nemerging symplectic form, while values of the corresponding metric form are\ncontinuous. A complete analytical solution of the problem is presented.\n", "  The detection of particles with only gravitational interactions (Newtorites)\nin gravitational bar detectors was studied in 1984 by Bernard, De Rujula and\nLautrup. The negative results of dark matter searches suggest to look to exotic\npossibilities like Newtorites. The limits obtained with the Nautilus bar\ndetector will be presented and the possible improvements will be discussed.\nSince the gravitational coupling is very weak, the possible limits are very far\nfrom what is needed for dark matter, but for large masses are the best limits\nobtained on the Earth. An update of limits for MACRO particles will be given.\n", "  The hadronic leading-order (hlo) contribution to the lepton anomalous\nmagnetic moments $a_l^\\mathrm{hlo}$ of the Standard Model leptons still\naccounts for the dominant source of the uncertainty of the Standard Model\nestimates. We present the results of an investigation of the hadronic leading\norder anomalous magnetic moments of the electron, muon and tau lepton from\nfirst principles in twisted mass lattice QCD. With lattice data for multiple\npion masses in the range $230 \\mathrm{~MeV} \\lesssim m_{PS} \\lesssim 490\n\\mathrm{~MeV}$, multiple lattice volumes and three lattice spacings we perform\nthe extrapolation to the continuum and to the physical pion mass and check for\nall systematic uncertainties in the lattice calculation. As a result we\ncalculate $a_{l}^\\mathrm{hlo}$ for the three Standard Model leptons with\ncontrolled statistical and systematic error in agreement with phenomenological\ndeterminations using dispersion relations and experimental data. In addition,\nwe also give a first estimate of the hadronic leading order anomalous magnetic\nmoments from simulations directly at the physical value of the pion mass.\n", "  We present the last applications of the unquenched quark model (UQM) to the\ndescription of flavour asymmetry and strangeness in the proton when\nbaryon-meson components are included. In the meson sector, the UQM is used to\ncalculate the charmonium and bottomonium spectra with self-energy corrections\ndue to the coupling to the meson-meson continuum.\n", "  Recent calculations of the hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution are\nreviewed. The focus is put on the leading-order contribution to the muon\nmagnetic anomaly involving $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross section data as input to\na dispersion relation approach. Alternative calculation including tau data is\nalso discussed. The $\\tau$ data are corrected for various isospin-breaking\nsources which are explicitly shown source by source.\n", "  We explore the effects of non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) and how\nthey modify neutrino propagation in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment\n(DUNE). We find that NSI can significantly modify the data to be collected by\nthe DUNE experiment as long as the new physics parameters are large enough. For\nexample, If the DUNE data are consistent with the standard\nthree-massive-neutrinos paradigm, order 0.1 (in units of the Fermi constant)\nNSI effects will be ruled out. On the other hand, if large NSI effects are\npresent, DUNE will be able to not only rule out the standard paradigm but also\nmeasure the new physics parameters, sometimes with good precision. We find\nthat, in some cases, DUNE is sensitive to new sources of CP-invariance\nviolation. We also explored whether DUNE data can be used to distinguish\ndifferent types of new physics beyond nonzero neutrino masses. In more detail,\nwe asked whether NSI can be mimicked, as far as the DUNE setup is concerned, by\nthe hypothesis that there is a new light neutrino state.\n", "  We discuss the extended on-mass-shell scheme for manifestly Lorentz-invariant\nbaryon chiral perturbation theory. We present a calculation of pion photo- and\nelectroproduction up to and including order $q^4$. The low-energy constants\nhave been fixed by fitting experimental data in all available reaction\nchannels. Our results can be accessed via a web interface, the so-called chiral\nMAID (http://www.kph.uni-mainz.de/MAID/chiralmaid/). We explain how our program\nworks and how it can be used for further analysis.\n", "  Katla is a threatening volcano in Iceland, partly covered by the\nM\\'yrdalsj\\\"okull ice cap. The volcano has a large caldera with several active\ngeothermal areas. A peculiar cluster of long-period seismic events started on\nKatla's south flank in July 2011, during an unrest episode in the caldera that\nculminated in a glacier outburst. The seismic events were tightly clustered at\nshallow depth in the Gvendarfell area, 4 km south of the caldera, under a small\nglacier stream on the southern margin of M\\'yrdalsj\\\"okull. No seismic events\nwere known to have occurred in this area before. The most striking feature of\nthis seismic cluster is its temporal pattern, characterized by regular\nintervals between repeating seismic events, modulated by a seasonal variation.\nRemarkable is also the stability of both the time and waveform features over a\nlong time period, around 3.5 years. No comparable examples have been found in\nthe literature. Both volcanic and glacial processes can produce similar\nwaveforms and therefore have to be considered as potential seismic sources.\nDiscerning between these two causes is critical for monitoring glacier-clad\nvolcanoes and has been controversial at Katla. For this new seismic cluster on\nthe south flank we regard volcano-related processes as more likely than glacial\nones for the following reasons: 1) the seismic activity started during an\nunrest episode involving sudden melting of the glacier and a j\\\"okulhlaup; 2)\nthe glacier stream is small and stagnant; 3) the seismicity remains regular and\nstable for years; 4) there is no apparent correlation with short-term weather\nchanges, such as rain storms. We suggest that a small, shallow hydrothermal\nsystem was activated on Katla's south flank in 2011, either by a minor magmatic\ninjection or by changes of permeability in a local crack system.\n", "  We investigate a free one-dimensional spinless Fermi gas, and the\nTonks-Girardeau gas interacting with a single impurity particle of equal mass.\nWe obtain a Fredholm determinant representation for the time-dependent\ncorrelation function of the impurity particle. This representation is valid for\nan arbitrary temperature and an arbitrary repulsive or attractive impurity-gas\n$\\delta$-function interaction potential. It includes, as particular cases, the\nrepresentations obtained for zero temperature and arbitrary repulsion in [Nucl.\nPhys. B 892, 83 (2015)], and for arbitrary temperature and infinite repulsion\nin [Nucl. Phys. B 520, 594 (1998)].\n", "  Superconductivity in topological band structures is a platform for many novel\nexotic quantum phenomena such as emergent supersymmetry. This potential\nnourishes the search for topological materials with intrinsic superconducting\ninstabilities, in which Cooper pairing is introduced to electrons with helical\nspin texture such as the Dirac states of topological insulators and Dirac\nSemimetals, forming a natural topological superconductor of helical kind. We\nemploy first-principles calculations, ARPES experiments and new theoretical\nanalysis to reveal that PbTaSe2, a non-centrosymmetric superconductor,\npossesses a nonzero Z2 topological invariant and fully spin-polarized Dirac\nstates. Moreover, we analyze the phonon spectrum of PbTaSe2 to show how\nsuperconductivity can emerge due to a stiffening of phonons by the Pb\nintercalation, which diminishes a competing charge-density-wave instability.\nOur work establishes PbTaSe2 as a stoichiometric superconductor with nontrivial\nZ2 topological band structure, and shows that it holds great promise for\nstudying novel forms of topological superconductivity not realized previously.\n", "  We report the discovery of HATS-15 b and HATS-16 b, two massive transiting\nextrasolar planets orbiting evolved ($\\sim 10$ Gyr) main-sequence stars. The\nplanet HATS-15 b, which is hosted by a G9V star ($V=14.8$ mag), is a hot\nJupiter with mass of $2.17\\pm0.15\\, M_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and radius of\n$1.105\\pm0.0.040\\, R_{\\mathrm{J}}$, and completes its orbit in nearly 1.7 days.\nHATS-16 b is a very massive hot Jupiter with mass of $3.27\\pm0.19\\,\nM_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and radius of $1.30\\pm0.15\\, R_{\\mathrm{J}}$; it orbits around\nits G3 V parent star ($V=13.8$ mag) in $\\sim2.7$ days. HATS-16 is slightly\nactive and shows a periodic photometric modulation, implying a rotational\nperiod of 12 days which is unexpectedly short given its isochronal age. This\nfast rotation might be the result of the tidal interaction between the star and\nits planet.\n", "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will be a premier facility\nfor exploring long-standing questions about the boundaries of the standard\nmodel. Acting in concert with the liquid argon time projection chambers\nunderpinning the far detector design, the DUNE photon detection system will\ncapture ultraviolet scintillation light in order to provide valuable timing\ninformation for event reconstruction. To maximize the active area while\nmaintaining a small photocathode coverage, the experiment will utilize a design\nbased on plastic light guides coated with a wavelength-shifting compound, along\nwith silicon photomultipliers, to collect and record scintillation light from\nliquid argon. This report presents recent preliminary performance measurements\nof this baseline design and several alternative designs which promise\nsignificant improvements in sensitivity to low-energy interactions.\n", "  We report the successful growth of high-quality SrO films on highly-ordered\npyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and single-layer graphene by molecular beam epitaxy.\nThe SrO layers have (001) orientation as confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD)\nwhile atomic force microscopy measurements show continuous pinhole-free films\nhaving rms surface roughness of <1.5 {\\AA}. Transport measurements of\nexfoliated graphene after SrO deposition show a strong dependence between the\nDirac point and Sr oxidation. Subsequently, the SrO is leveraged as a buffer\nlayer for more complex oxide integration via the demonstration of (001)\noriented SrTiO3 grown atop a SrO/HOPG stack.\n", "  On the basis of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, we study quark flavor mixings\nin the $SU(6) \\times SU(2)_R$ model. The characteristic structure of the CKM\nmatrix is attributed to the hierarchical effective Yukawa couplings due to the\nFroggatt-Nielsen mechanism and also to the state-mixings beyond the MSSM. We\nelucidate the detailed form of the CKM matrix elements and find interesting\nrelations between the \\textit{CP} violating phase and three mixing angles.\nTaking the existing data of three mixing angles, we estimate the quark\n\\textit{CP}-phase at $\\delta = (75 \\pm 3)^{\\circ}$. This result is in accord\nwith observations.\n", "  This paper is based on a talk delivered on 16 November, 2015 in Osaka at the\nNambu's Century: International Symposium on Yoichiro Nambu's Physics\n", "  The effective action of the recently proposed vector Galileon theory is\nconsidered. Using the background field method, we obtain the one-loop\ncorrection to the propagator of the Proca field from vector Galileon\nself-interactions. Contrary to the so-called scalar Galileon interactions, the\ntwo-point function of the vector field gets renormalized at the one-loop level,\nindicating that there is no non-renormalization theorem in the vector Galileon\ntheory. Using dimensional regularization, we remove the divergences and obtain\nthe counterterms of the theory. The finite term is analytically calculated,\nwhich modifies the propagator and the mass term and generates some new terms\nalso.\n", "  Studying excited nucleon structure through exclusive electroproduction\nreactions is an important avenue for exploring the nature of the\nnon-perturbative strong interaction. Electrocouplings for $N^*$ states in the\nmass range below 1.8~GeV have been determined from analyses of CLAS $\\pi N$,\n$\\eta N$, and $\\pi \\pi N$ data. This work made it clear that consistency of\nindependent analyses of exclusive channels with different couplings and\nnon-resonant backgrounds but the same $N^*$ electro-excitation amplitudes, is\nessential to have confidence in the extracted results. In terms of hadronic\ncoupling, many high-lying $N^*$ states preferentially decay through the $\\pi\n\\pi N$ channel instead of $\\pi N$. Data from the $KY$ channels will therefore\nbe critical to provide an independent analysis to compare the extracted\nelectrocouplings for the high-lying $N^*$ states against those determined from\nthe $\\pi N$ and $\\pi \\pi N$ channels. A program to study excited $N^*$ decays\nto non-strange and strange exclusive final states using CLAS12 will measure\ndifferential cross sections to be used as input to extract the $\\gamma_vNN^*$\ntransition form factors for the most prominent $N^*$ states in the range of\ninvariant energy $W$ up 3~GeV in the virtually unexplored domain of momentum\ntransfers $Q^2$ up to 12~GeV$^2$.\n", "  Many real-world relations can be represented by signed networks with positive\nand negative links, as a result of which signed network analysis has attracted\nincreasing attention from multiple disciplines. With the increasing prevalence\nof social media networks, signed network analysis has evolved from developing\nand measuring theories to mining tasks. In this article, we present a review of\nmining signed networks in the context of social media and discuss some\npromising research directions and new frontiers. We begin by giving basic\nconcepts and unique properties and principles of signed networks. Then we\nclassify and review tasks of signed network mining with representative\nalgorithms. We also delineate some tasks that have not been extensively studied\nwith formal definitions and also propose research directions to expand the\nfield of signed network mining.\n", "  We analyze the nature of the single particle states, away from the Dirac\npoint, in the presence of long-range charge impurities in a tight-binding model\nfor electrons on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice which is of direct\nrelevance for graphene. For a disorder potential\n$V(\\vec{r})=V_0\\exp(-|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_{imp}|^2/\\xi^2)$, we demonstrate that not\nonly the Dirac state but all the single particle states remain extended for\nweak enough disorder. Based on our numerical calculations of inverse\nparticipation ratio, dc conductivity, diffusion coefficient and the\nlocalization length from time evolution dynamics of the wave packet, we show\nthat the threshold $V_{th}$ required to localize a single particle state of\nenergy $E(\\vec{k})$ is minimum for the states near the band edge and is maximum\nfor states near the band center, implying a mobility edge starting from the\nband edge for weak disorder and moving towards the band center as the disorder\nstrength increases. This can be explained in terms of the low energy\nHamiltonian at any point $\\vec{k}$ which has the same nature as that at the\nDirac point. From the nature of the eigenfunctions it follows that a weak long\nrange impurity will cause weak anti localization effects, which can be\nsuppressed, giving localization if the strength of impurities is sufficiently\nlarge to cause inter-valley scattering. The inter valley spacing $2|\\vec{k}|$\nincreases as one moves in from the band edge towards the band center, which is\nreflected in the behavior of $V_{th}$ and the mobility edge.\n", "  Effects related with deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium take a special\nplace in the modern physics. Among those, non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum\nsystems attract the highest interest. To date, the experimental technique of\nspin noise spectroscopy has became quite widespread, which makes possible to\nobserve spin fluctuations of charge carriers in semiconductors both in\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. It calls for development of the\ntheory of spin fluctuations of electrons and electron-hole complexes for\nnon-equilibrium conditions. In this paper we consider a range of physical\nsituations where a deviation from an equilibrium becomes pronounced in the spin\nnoise. A general method of calculation of electron and exciton spin\nfluctuations in non-equilibrium state is proposed. A short review of\ntheoretical and experimental results in this area is given.\n", "  In the present work, we theoretically analyze the steady-state thermoelectric\ntransport through a single-molecule junction with a vibrating bridge. Thermally\ninduced charge current in the system is explored using a nonequilibrium Green's\nfunctions formalism. We study combined effects of Coulomb interactions between\ncharge carriers on the bridge and electron-phonon interactions on the\nthermocurrent beyond the linear response regime. It is shown that\nelectron-vibron interactions may significantly affect both magnitude and\ndirection of the thermocurrent, and vibrational signatures may appear.\n", "  Motivated by the long-debated question about the internal stability of the\nelectron, the force densities acting on the charge density of the 1s electron\nin the H atom are investigated. The problem is mapped onto the canonical\nformalism for a classical Dirac field coupled to the electric field of an\nexternal point charge. An explicit calculation shows that the attractive\nCoulomb force density is balanced exactly at every point in space by the\nrepulsive confinement force density. The latter requires evaluating the\ndivergence of the stress tensor for the 1s solution of the Dirac equation. Such\na local force balance goes beyond the global stability criteria that are\nusually given for the H atom. This concept is extended to the internal\nstability of any charged particle by investigating the force densities acting\non its surrounding vacuum polarization. At large distances one has to consider\nonly the charge density of virtual electrons and positrons, induced by a point\ncharge in the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  The properties of Josephson tunneling between a single band s-wave\nsuperconductor and a two band $s_\\pm$ superconductor are studied, in relation\nto recent experiments involving iron-based superconductors. We study a single\njunction and tune the order parameter (OP) phase difference across the\njunction. We find a variety of behaviors which are characterized by their\nenergy-phase difference relation. The system is modeled on a lattice and\ntreated in self-consistent mean field approximation. We also study a loop\nstructure made with s-wave and $s_\\pm$ parts with two junctions between the\nparts. The phase of the order parameter is then controlled by a magnetic flux\nthreading the loop. Our analysis suggests four types of junction behaviors\nwhich are characterized by the dependence of the junction energy on the phase\ndifference between the s-wave and the $s_\\pm$ superconductors. The energy vs.\nphase difference curve has either one minimum at $\\Delta\\phi = 0,\\pi$ or\nsomewhere in between, or a double minimum structure. This leads to four\ndifferent behaviors in a loop structure as a function of the flux threaded\nthrough the loop.\n", "  The properties of ultracold quantum gases of bosons with dipole-dipole\ninteraction is investigated at finite temperature in the frame of the\nrepresentative ensembles theory. Self-consistent coupled equations of motion\nare derived for the condensate and the non-condensate components. Corrections\ndue to the dipolar interaction to the condensate depletion, the anomalous\ndensity and thermodynamic quantities such as the ground state energy, the\nequation of state, the compressibility and the presure are calculated in the\nhomogeneous case at both zero and finite temperatures. Effects of interaction\nand temperature on the structure factor are also discussed. Within the realm of\nthe local density approximation, we generalize our results to the case of a\ntrapped dipolar gas.\n", "  In this contribution we discuss next-to-next-to-leading order hadronic and\nfour-loop QED contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.\n", "  We reconsider the moments of the reduced density matrix of two disjoint\nintervals and of its partial transpose with respect to one interval for\ncritical free fermionic lattice models. It is known that these matrices are\nsums of either two or four Gaussian matrices and hence their moments can be\nreconstructed as computable sums of products of Gaussian operators. We find\nthat, in the scaling limit, each term in these sums is in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the partition function of the corresponding conformal field\ntheory on the underlying Riemann surface with a given spin structure. The\nanalytical findings have been checked against numerical results for the Ising\nchain and for the XX spin chain at the critical point.\n", "  In this talk, we report the study of $\\pi^- p \\to K^{*0} \\Lambda$ and $\\pi^-\np \\to D^{*-} \\Lambda_c^+$ reactions by using an effective Lagrangian method and\na hybrid Regge model. The total and differential cross sections for the $K^{*0}\n\\Lambda$ production are first calculated and then those for the $D^{*-}\n\\Lambda_c^+$ one are estimated. The two models yield different results, each\nexhibiting specific features. Our prediction for the charm production provides\nvaluable information about the upcoming J-PARC experiment.\n", "  In this paper we propose versions of the associative Yang-Baxter equation and\nhigher order $R$-matrix identities which can be applied to quantum dynamical\n$R$-matrices. As is known quantum non-dynamical $R$-matrices of Baxter-Belavin\ntype satisfy this equation. Together with unitarity condition and skew-symmetry\nit provides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation and a set of identities useful for\ndifferent applications in integrable systems. The dynamical $R$-matrices\nsatisfy the Gervais-Neveu-Felder (or dynamical Yang-Baxter) equation. Relation\nbetween the dynamical and non-dynamical cases is described by the IRF-Vertex\ntransformation. An alternative approach to quantum (semi-)dynamical\n$R$-matrices and related quantum algebras was suggested by Arutyunov, Chekhov\nand Frolov (ACF) in their study of the quantum Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The\npurpose of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that the ACF elliptic\n$R$-matrix satisfies the associative Yang-Baxter equation with shifted spectral\nparameters. Second, we directly prove a simple relation of the IRF-Vertex type\nbetween the Baxter-Belavin and the ACF elliptic $R$-matrices predicted\npreviously by Avan and Rollet. It provides the higher order $R$-matrix\nidentities and an explanation of the obtained equations through those for\nnon-dynamical $R$-matrices. As a by-product we also get an interpretation of\nthe intertwining transformation as matrix extension of scalar theta function\nlikewise $R$-matrix is interpreted as matrix extension of the Kronecker\nfunction. Relations to the Gervais-Neveu-Felder equation and identities for the\nFelder's elliptic $R$-matrix are also discussed.\n", "  Here we work out in detail a non-perturbative approach to the dirty boson\nproblem, which relies on the Hartree-Fock theory and the replica method. For a\nweakly interacting Bose gas within a trapped confinement and a delta-correlated\ndisorder potential at finite temperature, we determine the underlying free\nenergy. From it we determine via extremization self-consistency equations for\nthe three components of the particle density, namely the condensate density,\nthe thermal density, and the density of fragmented local Bose-Einstein\ncondensates within the respective minima of the random potential landscape.\nSolving these self-consistency equations in one and three dimensions in two\nother publications has revealed how these three densities change for increasing\ndisorder strength.\n", "  A wide class of non-stationary superdiffusive transport on a uniform\nbackground with a power-law decay, at large distances, of the step-length\nprobability distribution function (PDF) is shown to possess an automodel\nsolution. The solution for Green function is constructed using the scaling laws\nfor the propagation front (relevant-to-superdiffusion average displacement) and\nasymptotic solutions far beyond and far in advance of the propagation front.\nThese scaling laws are determined essentially by the long-free-path carriers\n(L\\'evy flights). The validity of the suggested automodel solution is proved by\nits comparison with numerical solutions in the one-dimensional (1D) case of the\ntransport equation with a simple long-tailed PDF with various power-law\nexponents and in the 3D case of the Biberman-Holstein equation of the resonance\nradiation transfer for various (Doppler, Lorentz, Voight and Holtsmark)\nspectral line shapes.\n", "  High precision data of dilepton angular distributions in $\\gamma^*/Z$\nproduction were reported recently by the CMS Collaboration covering a broad\nrange of the dilepton transverse momentum, $q_T$, up to $\\sim 300$ GeV.\nPronounced $q_T$ dependencies of the $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$ parameters,\ncharacterizing the $\\cos^2\\theta$ and $\\cos 2\\phi$ angular distributions, were\nfound. Violation of the Lam-Tung relation was also clearly observed. We show\nthat the $q_T$ dependence of $\\lambda$ allows a determination of the relative\ncontributions of the $q \\bar q$ annihilation versus the $qG$ Compton process.\nThe violation of the Lam-Tung relation is attributed to the presence of a\nnon-zero component of the $q - \\bar q$ axis in the direction normal to the\n\"hadron plane\" formed by the colliding hadrons. The magnitude of the violation\nof the Lam-Tung relation is shown to reflect the amount of this\n`non-coplanarity\". The observed $q_T$ dependencies of $\\lambda$ and $\\nu$ from\nthe CMS and the earlier CDF data can be well described using this approach.\n", "  By using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations(NEMD), the modulation\non temperature dependence of thermal conductivity of graphene phononic crystals\n(GPnCs) are investigated. It is found that the temperature dependence of\nthermal conductivity of GPnCs follows $T^{-\\alpha}$ behavior. The power\nexponents ($\\alpha$) can be efficiently tuned by changing the characteristic\nsize of GPnCs. The phonon participation ratio spectra and dispersion relation\nreveal that the long-range phonon modes are more affected in GPnCs with larger\nsize of holes ($L_0$). Our results suggest that constructing GPnCs is an\neffective method to manipulate the temperature dependence of thermal\nconductivity of graphene, which would be beneficial for developing GPnCs-based\nthermal management and signal processing devices.\n", "  Predefined spatial templates to describe the background of $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from astrophysical processes, like cosmic ray interactions, are used\nin previous searches for the $\\gamma$-ray signatures of annihilating galactic\ndark matter. In this proceeding, we investigate the GeV excess in the inner\nGalaxy using an alternative approach, in which the astrophysical components are\nidentified solely by their spectral and morphological properties. We confirm\nthe reported GeV excess and derive related parameters for dark matter\ninterpretation, which are consistent with previous results. We investigate the\nmorphology of this spectral excess as preferred by the data only. This emission\ncomponent exhibits a central Galaxy cusp as expected for a dark matter\nannihilation signal. However, Galactic disk regions with a morphology of that\nof the hot interstellar medium also host such a spectral component. This points\nto a possible astrophysical origin of the excess and requests a more detailed\nunderstanding of astrophysical $\\gamma$-ray emitting processes in the galactic\ncenter region before definite claims about a dark matter annihilation signal\ncan be made.\n", "  We examined the electrical transport properties of densified LaOBiS2-xSex,\nwhich constitutes a new family of thermoelectric materials. The power factor\nincreased with increasing concentration of Se, i.e., Se substitution led to an\nenhanced electrical conductivity, without suppression of the Seebeck\ncoefficient. Hall measurements indicated that the low electrical resistivity\nresulted from increases in the carrier mobility, and the decrease in carrier\nconcentration led to large absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient of the\nsystem.\n", "  This brief review focuses on the low-lying even- and odd-parity excitations\nof the nucleon obtained in recent lattice QCD calculations. Commencing with a\nsurvey of the 2014-15 literature we'll see that results for the first\neven-parity excitation energy can differ by as much as 1 GeV, a rather\nunsatisfactory situation. Following a brief review of the methods used to\nisolate excitations of the nucleon in lattice QCD, and drawing on recent\nadvances, we'll see how a consensus on the low-lying spectrum has emerged among\nmany different lattice groups. To provide insight into the nature of these\nstates we'll review the wave functions and electromagnetic form factors that\nare available for a few of these states. Consistent with the Luscher formalism\nfor extracting phase shifts from finite volume spectra, the Hamiltonian\napproach to effective field theory in finite volume can provide guidance on the\nmanner in which physical quantities manifest themselves in the finite volume of\nthe lattice. With this insight, we will address the question; Have we seen the\nRoper in lattice QCD?\n", "  The pion properties in symmetric nuclear matter are investigated with the\nQuark-Meson Coupling (QMC) Model plus the light-front constituent quark\nmodel~(LFCQM). The LFCQM has been quite successful in describing the properties\nof pseudoscalar mesons in vacuum, such as the electromagnetic elastic form\nfactors, electromagnetic radii, and decay constants. We study the pion\nproperties in symmetric nuclear matter with the in-medium input recalculated\nthrough the QMC model, which provides the in-medium modification of the LFCQM.\n", "  We present, discuss and validate an adapted S-matrix formalism for an\nefficient, simplified treatment of stacked homogeneous periodically structured\nmetasurfaces operated under normally incident plane wave excitation. The\nproposed formalism can be applied to any material system, arbitrarily shaped\nmetaatoms, at any frequency and with arbitrary subwavelength periods.\nCircumventing the introduction of any kind of effective parameters we directly\nuse the S-parameters of the individual metasurfaces to calculate the response\nof an arbitrary stack. In fact, the S-parameters are the complex parameters of\nchoice fully characterizing the homogeneous metasurfaces, in particular with\nrespect to its polarization manipulating properties. Just as effective material\nparameters like the permittivity and the permeability or wave parameters like\nthe propagation constant and the impedance, the stacking based upon S-matrices\ncan be applied as long as the individual layers are decoupled with respect to\ntheir near-fields. This requirement eventually sets the limits for using the\noptical properties of the individual layers to calculate the response of the\nstacked system - this being the conceptual aim for any homogeneous metasurface\nor metamaterial layer and therefore the essence of what is eventually possible\nwith homogeneous metasurfaces. As simple and appealing this approach is, as\npowerful it is as well: Combining structured metasurface with each other as\nwell as with isotropic, anisotropic or chiral homogeneous layers is possible by\nsimple semi-analytical S-matrix multiplication. Hence, complex stacks and\nresonators can be set up, accurately treated and optimized with respect to\ntheir dispersive polarization sensitive optical functionality without the need\nfor further rigorous full-wave simulations.\n", "  In three dimensional (3D) disordered metals, the electron-phonon\n(\\emph{e}-ph) scattering is the sole significant inelastic process. Thus the\ntheoretical predication concerning the electron-electron (\\emph{e}-\\emph{e})\nscattering rate $1/\\tau_\\varphi$ as a function of temperature $T$ in 3D\ndisordered metal has not been fully tested thus far, though it was proposed 40\nyears ago [A. Schmid, Z. Phys. \\textbf{271}, 251 (1974)]. We report here the\nsimultaneous observation of small- and large-energy-transfer \\emph{e}-\\emph{e}\nscattering in 3D indium oxide thick films. In temperature region of\n$T\\gtrsim100$\\,K, the temperature dependence of resistivities curves of the\nfilms obey Bloch-Gr\\\"{u}neisen law, indicating the films possess degenerate\nsemiconductor characteristics in electrical transport property. In the low\ntemperature regime, $1/\\tau_\\varphi$ as a function of $T$ for each film can not\nbe ascribed to \\emph{e}-ph scattering. To quantitatively describe the\ntemperature behavior of $1/\\tau_\\varphi$, both the 3D small- and\nlarge-energy-transfer \\emph{e}-\\emph{e} scattering processes should be\nconsidered (The small- and large-energy-transfer \\emph{e}-\\emph{e} scattering\nrates are proportional to $T^{3/2}$ and $T^2$, respectively). In addition, the\nexperimental prefactors of $T^{3/2}$ and $T^{2}$ are proportional to\n$k_F^{-5/2}\\ell^{-3/2}$ and $E_F^{-1}$ ($k_F$ is the Fermi wave number, $\\ell$\nis the electron elastic mean free path, and $E_F$ is the Fermi energy),\nrespectively, which are completely consistent with the theoretical\npredications. Our experimental results fully demonstrate the validity of\ntheoretical predications concerning both small- and large-energy-transfer\n\\emph{e}-\\emph{e} scattering rates.\n", "  We derive very simple compact equation for gravity water waves which includes\nnonlinear wave term (`a la NLSE) and advection term (may results in wave\nbreaking).\n", "  Aim of the QUAX (QUaerere AXion) proposal is to exploit the interaction of\ncosmological axions with the spin of electrons in a magnetized sample. Their\neffect is equivalent to the application of an oscillating rf field with\nfrequency and amplitude which are fixed by axion mass and coupling constant,\nrespectively. The rf receiver module of the QUAX detector consists of\nmagnetized samples with the Larmor resonance frequency tuned to the axion mass\nby a polarizing static magnetic field. The interaction of electrons with the\naxion-equivalent rf field produces oscillations in the total magnetization of\nthe samples. To amplify such a tiny field, a pump field at the same frequency\nis applied in a direction orthogonal to the polarizing field. The induced\noscillatory magnetization along the polarizing field is measured by a SQUID\namplifier operated at its quantum noise level.\n", "  We present the results of a four-month campaign searching for low-frequency\nradio transients near the North Celestial Pole with the Low-Frequency Array\n(LOFAR), as part of the Multifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS). The data\nwere recorded between 2011 December and 2012 April and comprised 2149 11-minute\nsnapshots, each covering 175 deg^2. We have found one convincing candidate\nastrophysical transient, with a duration of a few minutes and a flux density at\n60 MHz of 15-25 Jy. The transient does not repeat and has no obvious optical or\nhigh-energy counterpart, as a result of which its nature is unclear. The\ndetection of this event implies a transient rate at 60 MHz of 3.9 (+14.7, -3.7)\nx 10^-4 day^-1 deg^-2, and a transient surface density of 1.5 x 10^-5 deg^-2,\nat a 7.9-Jy limiting flux density and ~10-minute time-scale. The campaign data\nwere also searched for transients at a range of other time-scales, from 0.5 to\n297 min, which allowed us to place a range of limits on transient rates at 60\nMHz as a function of observation duration.\n", "  The remarkable robustness of high-temperature superconductors against\ndisorder remains a controversial obstacle towards the elucidation of their\npairing state. Indeed, experiments report a weak suppression rate of the\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ with disorder, significantly smaller than the\nuniversal value predicted by extensions of the conventional theory of dirty\nsuperconductors. However, in many high-$T_{c}$ compounds, superconductivity\nappears near a putative magnetic quantum critical point, suggesting that\nquantum fluctuations, which suppress coherent electronic spectral weight, may\nalso promote unconventional pairing. Here we investigate theoretically the\nimpact of disorder on such a quantum critical pairing state, considering the\ncoupling of impurities both to the low-energy electronic states and to the\npairing interaction itself. We find a significant reduction in the suppression\nrate of $T_{c}$ with disorder near the magnetic quantum critical point,\nshedding new light on the nature of unconventional superconductivity in\ncorrelated materials.\n", "  We have demonstrated that the polarization of the fullerene shell\nconsiderably alters the polarization potential of an atom, stuffed inside a\nfullerene. This essentially affects the electron elastic scattering phases as\nwell as corresponding cross-sections. We illustrate the general trend by\nconcrete examples of electron scattering by endohedrals of Neon and Argon. To\nobtain the presented results, we have suggested a simplified approach that\npermits to incorporate the effect of fullerenes polarizability into the Neon\nand Argon endohedrals polarization potential. As a result, we obtained numeric\nresults that show strong variations in shape and magnitudes of scattering\nphases and cross-sections due to effect of fullerene polarization upon the\nendohedral polarization potential.\n", "  We performed a search for 4He-eta bound state with high statistics and high\nacceptance with the WASA-at-COSY facility using a ramped beam technique. The\nsignature of eta-mesic nuclei is searched for in dd -> 3Henpi0 and dd ->\n3Heppi- reactions by the measurement of the excitation functions in the\nvicinity of the {\\eta} production threshold. This paper presents the\nexperimental method and the preliminary results of the data analysis for dd ->\n3Henpi0 process.\n", "  Using the cosmological hydrodynamics simulation Horizon-AGN, we investigate\nthe spatial distribution of satellite galaxies relative to their central\ncounterpart in the redshift range between 0.3 and 0.8. We find that, on\naverage, these satellites tend to be located on the galactic plane of the\ncentral object. This effect is detected for central galaxies with a stellar\nmass larger than 10^10 solar masses and found to be strongest for red passive\ngalaxies, while blue galaxies exhibit a weaker trend. For galaxies with a minor\naxis parallel to the direction of the nearest filament, we find that the\ncoplanarity is stronger in the vicinity of the central galaxy, and decreases\nwhen moving towards the outskirts of the host halo. By contrast, the spatial\ndistribution of satellite galaxies relative to their closest filament follows\nthe opposite trend: their tendency to align with them dominates at large\ndistances from the central galaxy, and fades away in its vicinity. Relying on\nmock catalogs of galaxies in that redshift range, we show that massive red\ncentrals with a spin perpendicular to their filament also have corotating\nsatellites well aligned with both the galactic plane and the filament. On the\nother hand, lower-mass blue centrals with a spin parallel to their filament\nhave satellites flowing straight along this filament, and hence orthogonally to\ntheir galactic plane. The orbit of these satellites is then progressively bent\ntowards a better alignment with the galactic plane as they penetrate the\ncentral region of their host halo. The kinematics previously described are\nconsistent with satellite infall and spin build-up via quasi-polar flows,\nfollowed by a re-orientation of the spin of massive red galaxies through\nmergers.\n", "  Results are presented for an open Floquet topological system represented by\nDirac fermions coupled to a circularly polarized laser and an external\nreservoir. It is shown that when the separation between quasi-energy bands\nbecomes small, and comparable to the coupling strength to the reservoir, the\nreduced density matrix in the Floquet basis, even at steady-state, has non-zero\noff-diagonal elements, with the magnitude of the off-diagonal elements\nincreasing with the strength of the coupling to the reservoir. In contrast, the\ncoupling to the reservoir only weakly affects the diagonal elements, hence\ninducing an effective coherence. The steady-state reduced density matrix\nsynchronizes with the periodic drive, and a Fourier analysis allows the\nextraction of the occupation probabilities of the Floquet quasi-energy levels.\nThe lack of detailed balance at steady-state is quantified in terms of an\nentropy production rate, and it is shown that this equals the heat current\nflowing out of the system, and into the reservoir. It is also shown that the\nentropy production rate mainly depends on the off-diagonal components of the\nFloquet density matrix. Thus a stronger coupling to the reservoir leads to an\nenhanced entropy production rate, implying a more efficient removal of heat\nfrom the system, which in turn helps the system maintain coherence. Analytic\nexpressions in the vicinity of the Dirac point are derived which highlights\nthese results, and also indicates how the reservoir may be engineered to\nenhance the coherence of the system.\n", "  Asymmetry measurements are common in collider experiments and can sensitively\nprobe particle properties. Typically, data can only be measured in a finite\nregion covered by the detector, so an extrapolation from the visible asymmetry\nto the inclusive asymmetry is necessary. Often a constant multiplicative factor\nis more than adequate for the extrapolation and this factor can be readily\ndetermined using simulation methods. However, there is a potential, avoidable\npitfall involved in the determination of this factor when the asymmetry in the\nsimulated data sample is small. We find that to obtain a reliable estimate of\nthe extrapolation factor, the number of simulated events required rises as the\ninverse square of the simulated asymmetry; this can mean that an unexpectedly\nlarge sample size is required when determining its value.\n", "  The broadening of lines by Stark effect is an important tool for inferring\nelectron density and temperature in plasmas. Stark-effect calculations often\nrely on atomic data (transition rates, energy levels,...) not always exhaustive\nand/or valid for isolated atoms. We present a recent development in the\ndetailed opacity code SCO-RCG for K-shell spectroscopy (hydrogen- and\nhelium-like ions). This approach is adapted from the work of Gilles and\nPeyrusse. Neglecting non-diagonal terms in dipolar and collision operators, the\nline profile is expressed as a sum of Voigt functions associated to the Stark\ncomponents. The formalism relies on the use of parabolic coordinates within\nSO(4) symmetry. The relativistic fine-structure of Lyman lines is included by\ndiagonalizing the hamiltonian matrix associated to quantum states having the\nsame principal quantum number $n$. The resulting code enables one to\ninvestigate plasma environment effects, the impact of the microfield\ndistribution, the decoupling between electron and ion temperatures and the role\nof satellite lines (such as Li-like $1sn\\ell n'\\ell' - 1s^2n\\ell$, Be-like,\netc.). Comparisons with simpler and widely-used semi-empirical models are\npresented.\n", "  We propose genetic algorithms, which are robust optimization techniques\ninspired by natural selection, to enhance the versatility of digital quantum\nsimulations. In this sense, we show that genetic algorithms can be employed to\nincrease the fidelity and optimize the resource requirements of digital quantum\nsimulation protocols, while adapting naturally to the experimental constraints.\nFurthermore, this method allows us to reduce not only digital errors, but also\nexperimental errors in quantum gates. Indeed, by adding ancillary qubits, we\ndesign a modular gate made out of imperfect gates, whose fidelity is larger\nthan the fidelity of any of the constituent gates. Finally, we prove that the\nproposed modular gates are resilient against different gate errors.\n", "  I report on the progress of two new muon anomalous magnetic moment\nexperiments, which are in advanced design and construction phases. The goal of\nFermilab E989 is to reduce the experimental uncertainty of $a_\\mu$ from\nBrookhaven E821 by a factor of 4; that is, $\\delta a_\\mu \\sim 16 \\times\n10^{-11}$, a relative uncertainty of 140~ppb. The method follows the same\nmagic-momentum storage ring concept used at BNL, and pioneered previously at\nCERN, but muon beam preparation, storage ring internal hardware, field\nmeasuring equipment, and detector and electronics systems are all new or\nupgraded significantly. In contrast, J-PARC E34 will employ a novel approach\nbased on injection of an ultra-cold, low-energy, muon beam injected into a\nsmall, but highly uniform magnet. Only a small magnetic focusing field is\nneeded to maintain storage, which distinguishes it from CERN, BNL and Fermilab.\nE34 aims to roughly match the previous BNL precision in their Phase~1\ninstallation.\n", "  Plasmonic phenomena are exhibited in light-matter interaction involving\nmaterials whose real parts of permittivity functions attain negative values at\noperating wavelengths. However, such materials usually suffer from dissipative\nlosses, thus limiting the performance of plasmon-based optical devices. Here,\nwe utilize an alternative methodology that mimics a variety of plasmonic\nphenomena by exploiting the well-known structural dispersion of electromagnetic\nmodes in bounded guided-wave structures filled with only materials with\npositive permittivity. A key issue in design of such structures is prevention\nof mode coupling, which can be achieved by implementing thin metallic wires at\nproper interfaces. This method, which is more suitable for lower frequencies,\nallows designers to employ conventional dielectrics and highly conductive\nmetals for which the loss is low at these frequencies, while achieving\nplasmonic features. We demonstrate, numerically and analytically, that this\nplatform can provide surface plasmon polaritons, local plasmonic resonance,\nplasmonic cloaking and epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-based tunneling using\nconventional positive-dielectric materials.\n", "  We use Molecular Dynamics simulations to explore the properties of dimmeric\nJanus nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are modeled as dumbbells. One kind of\nmonomer interacts by a Lennard-Jones potential, while the other specie of\nmonomer interacts though a two length scale potential. This specific two length\nscale potential do not present waterlike anomalies in bulk. However, our\nresults shows that, when combined in a dimmer, the Janus nanoparticle will have\nwaterlike anomalies. The self-assembly properties were also explored. We\nobserve several kinds of micelles, and a liquid-crystal phase. This results\nindicates that is possible to create Janus nanoparticles with waterlike\nfeatures using monomers without anomalous behavior. The anomalies and\nstructures are explained with the two length scale potential characteristics.\n", "  Generalised parton distributions (GPDs) and transverse momentum dependent\nparton distributions (TMDs) describe complementary aspects of the\nthree-dimensional structure of hadrons. We discuss their relation to each other\nand recall important theory results concerning their properties and their\nconnection with physical observables.\n", "  We investigate the quantum entanglement entropy for the four-dimensional\nEuclidean SU(3) gauge theory. We present the first non-perturbative calculation\nof the entropic $c$-function ($C(l)$) of SU(3) gauge theory in lattice Monte\nCarlo simulation using the replica method. For $0 \\leqslant l \\leqslant\n0.7$~fm, where $l$ is the length of the subspace, the entropic $c$-function is\nalmost constant, indicating conformally invariant dynamics. The value of the\nconstant agrees with that perturbatively obtained from free gluons, with 20 %\ndiscrepancy. When $l$ is close to the Hadronic scale, the entropic $c$-function\ndecreases smoothly, and it is consistent with zero within error bars at $l\n\\gtrsim 0.9$ fm.\n", "  Heterostructures consisting of a cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7x and a\nruthenate/manganite (SrRuO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3) spin valve have been studied by\nSQUID magnetometry, ferromagnetic resonances and neutron reflectometry. It was\nshown that due to the influence of magnetic proximity effect a magnetic moment\nis induced in the superconducting part of heterostructure and at the same time\nthe magnetic moment is suppressed in the ferromagnetic spin valve. The\nexperimental value of magnetization induced in the superconductor has the same\norder of magnitude with the calculations based on the induced magnetic moment\nof Cu atoms due to orbital reconstruction at the superconductor-ferromagnetic\ninterface. It corresponds also to the model that takes into account the change\nin the density of states at a distance of order of the coherence length in the\nsuperconductor. The experimentally obtained characteristic length of\npenetration of the magnetic moment into superconductor exceeds the coherence\nlength for cuprate superconductor. This fact points on the dominance of the\nmechanism of the induced magnetic moment of Cu atoms due to orbital\nreconstruction.\n", "  We present several analytical solutions of BPS vortices and monopoles in the\ngeneralized Abelian Maxwell-Higgs and Yang-Mills-Higgs theories, respectively.\nThese models have recently been extensively studied and several exact solutions\nhave already been obtained in \\cite{Casana:2014qfa, Casana:2013lna}. In each\ntheory, the dynamics is controlled by the additional two positive\nscalar-field-dependent functions, $f(|\\phi|)$ and $w(|\\phi|)$. For the case of\nvortices, we work in the ordinary symmetry-breaking Higgs potential, while for\nthe case of monopoles we have the ordinary condition of the Prasad-Sommerfield\nlimit. Our results generalize that of exact solutions found previously. We also\npresent solutions for BPS vortices with higher winding number. These solutions\nsuffer from the condition that $w(|\\phi|)$ has negative value at some finite\nrange of $r$, but we argue that since it satisfies the weaker positive-value\nconditions then the corresponding energy density is still positive-definite\nand, thus, they are acceptable BPS solutions.\n", "  We consider a boundary problem for 1D electrodynamics modeling of a pulse\npropagation in a metamaterial medium. We build and apply projecting operators\nto a Maxwell system in time domain that allows to split the linear propagation\nproblem to directed waves for a material relations with general dispersion.\nMatrix elements of the projectors act as convolution integral operators. For a\nweak nonlinearity we generalize the linear results still for arbitrary\ndispersion and derive the system of interacting right/left waves with combined\n(hybrid) amplitudes. The result is specified for the popular metamaterial model\nwith Drude formula for both permittivity and permeability coefficients. We also\ndiscuss and investigate stationary solutions of the system related to some\nboundary regimes.\n", "  We study and compare two analytic models of graphene quantum dots for\ncalculating charge relaxation times due to electron-phonon interaction.\nRecently, charge relaxation processes in graphene quantum dots have been probed\nexperimentally and here we provide a theoretical estimate of relaxations times.\nBy comparing a model with pure edge confinement to a model with electrostatic\nconfinement, we find that the latter features much larger relaxation times.\nInterestingly, relaxation times in electrostatically defined quantum dots are\npredicted to exceed the experimentally observed lower bound of ~100 ns.\n", "  What happens when a continuously evolving stochastic process is interrupted\nwith large changes at random intervals $\\tau$ distributed as a power-law $\\sim\n\\tau^{-(1+\\alpha)};\\alpha>0$? Modeling the stochastic process by diffusion and\nthe large changes as abrupt resets to the initial condition, we obtain {\\em\nexact} closed-form expressions for both static and dynamic quantities, while\naccounting for strong correlations implied by a power-law. Our results show\nthat the resulting dynamics exhibits a spectrum of rich long-time behavior,\nfrom an ever-spreading spatial distribution for $\\alpha < 1$, to one that is\ntime independent for $\\alpha > 1$. The dynamics has strong consequences on the\ntime to reach a distant target for the first time; we specifically show that\nthere exists an optimal $\\alpha$ that minimizes the mean time to reach the\ntarget, thereby offering a step towards a viable strategy to locate targets in\na crowded environment.\n", "  We present a study of the optical response of compact and hollow icosahedral\nclusters containing up to 868 silver atoms by means of time-dependent density\nfunctional theory. We have studied the dependence on size and morphology of\nboth the sharp plasmonic resonance at 3-4 eV (originated mainly from\n$sp$-electrons), and the less studied broader feature appearing in the 6-7 eV\nrange (interband transitions). An analysis of the effect of structural\nrelaxations, as well as the choice of exchange correlation functional (local\ndensity versus generalized gradient approximations) both in the ground state\nand optical response calculations is also presented. We have further analysed\nthe role of the different atom layers (surface versus inner layers) and the\ndifferent orbital symmetries on the absorption cross-section for energies up to\n8 eV. We have also studied the dependence on the number of atom layers in\nhollow structures. Shells formed by a single layer of atoms show a pronounced\nred shift of the main plasmon resonances that, however, rapidly converge to\nthose of the compact structures as the number of layers is increased. The\nmethods used to obtain these results are also carefully discussed. Our\nmethodology is based on the use of localized basis (atomic orbitals, and\natom-centered- and dominant- product functions), which bring several\ncomputational advantages related to their relatively small size and the\nsparsity of the resulting matrices. Furthermore, the use of basis sets of\natomic orbitals also brings the possibility to extend some of the standard\npopulation analysis tools (e.g., Mulliken population analysis) to the realm of\noptical excitations. Some examples of these analyses are described in the\npresent work.\n", "  We define objective Eulerian Coherent Structures (OECSs) in two-dimensional,\nnon-autonomous dynamical systems as instantaneously most influential material\ncurves. Specifically, OECSs are stationary curves of the averaged instantaneous\nmaterial stretching-rate or material shearing-rate functionals. From these\nobjective (frame-invariant) variational principles, we obtain explicit\ndifferential equations for hyperbolic, elliptic and parabolic OECSs. As\nillustration, we compute OECSs in an unsteady ocean velocity data set. In\ncomparison to structures suggested by other common Eulerian diagnostic tools,\nwe find OECSs to be the correct short-term cores of observed trajectory\ndeformation patterns.\n", "  In these proceedings some facts about resonances are discussed focussing on\nthe analytic properties of resonant amplitudes with special emphasis on model\nindependent analyses. As an illustrative example of the latter point the decays\nB and B_s to J/psi pi pi are discussed in some detail.\n", "  The Holstein Hamiltonian was proposed half a century ago; since then, decades\nof research have come up empty handed in the pursuit of a closed-form solution.\nAn exact solution to the two-site Holstein model is presented in this paper.\nThe obtained results provide a clear image of the Hamiltonian structure and\nallow for the investigation of the symmetry, energy level crossings and\npolaronic characteristics of the system. The main mathematical tool is a\nthree-term recurrence relation between the wave function amplitudes that was\nobtained using the properties of a family of orthogonal functions, namely the\nPoisson-Charlier polynomials. It is shown that, with the appropriate choice of\nbasis, the eigenfunctions of the problem naturally fall into two families\n(parities) associated with the discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry of the\nHamiltonian. The asymptotic solution to the recurrence relation is found by\nusing the Birkhoff expansion. The asymptotic sets the truncation criterion for\nthe wave function, which ensures the accurate calculation of the energy levels\nfor any strength of electron-phonon interaction. Level crossing of states with\ndifferent parities is discussed and the exact points of broken symmetry are\nfound analytically. The results are used as the building blocks for studying a\nfour-site system. The inherited symmetries lead to the formation of a sparse\nmatrix that is convenient for numerical calculations.\n", "  In excited molecules, the interaction between the covalent Rydberg and\nion-pair channels forms a unique class of excited Rydberg states, in which the\ninfinite manifold of vibrational levels are the equivalent of atomic Rydberg\nstates with a heavy electron mass. Production of the ion pair states usually\nrequires excitation through one or several interacting Rydberg states; these\ninteracting channels are pathways for loss of flux, diminishing the rate of ion\npair production. Here, we develop an analytical, asymptotic charge transfer\nmodel for the interaction between ultracold Rydberg molecular states, and\nemploy this method to demonstrate the utility of off-resonant field control\nover the ion pair formation, with near unity efficiency.\n", "  The interaction topology among the constituents of a complex network plays a\ncrucial role in the network's evolutionary mechanisms and functional behaviors.\nHowever, some network topologies are usually unknown or uncertain. Meanwhile,\ncoupling delay are ubiquitous in various man-made and natural networks. Hence,\nit is necessary to gain knowledge of the whole or partial topology of a complex\ndynamical network by taking into consideration communication delay. In this\npaper, topology identification of complex dynamical networks is investigated\nvia generalized synchronization of a two-layer network. Particularly, based on\nthe LaSalle-type invariance principle of stochastic differential delay\nequations, an adaptive control technique is proposed by constructing an\nauxiliary layer and designing proper control input and updating laws so that\nthe unknown topology can be recovered upon successful generalized\nsynchronization. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The technique provides a certain\ntheoretical basis for topology inference of complex networks. In particular,\nwhen the considered network is composed of systems with high-dimension or\ncomplicated dynamics, a simpler response layer can be constructed, which is\nconducive to circuit design. Moreover, it is practical to take into\nconsideration perturbations caused by control input. Finally, the method is\napplicable to infer topology of a subnetwork embedded within a complex system\nand locate hidden sources. We hope the results can provide basic insight into\nfurther research endeavors on understanding practical and economical topology\ninference of networks.\n", "  The external matter stress-tensor supporting charged Vaidya solution appears\nto violate weak energy condition in certain region of the spacetime. Motivated\nby this, a new interpretation of charged Vaidya solution was proposed by Ori\n[1] in which the energy condition continues to be satisfied. In this\nconstruction, one glues an outgoing Vaidya solution to the original ingoing\nVaidya solution provided the surface where the external stress-tensor vanishes\nis spacelike. We revisit this study and extend it to higher-dimensions, to AdS\nsettings, and to higher-derivative f(R) theories. In asymptotically flat space\ncontext, we explore in detail the case when the mass function m(v) is\nproportional to the charge function q(v). When the proportionality constant \\nu\n= q(v)/m(v) lies in between zero and one, we show that the surface where the\nexternal stress-tensor vanishes is spacelike and lies in between the inner and\nouter apparent horizons.\n", "  The $B^{+}\\to D^{+} K^{+} \\pi^{-}$ decay is observed in a data sample\ncorresponding to $3.0\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data recorded by the\nLHCb experiment during 2011 and 2012. The signal significance is $8\\,\\sigma$\nand the branching fraction is measured to be ${\\cal B}\\left(B^{+}\\to D^{+}\nK^{+} \\pi^{-}\\right) = (5.31 \\pm 0.90 \\pm 0.48 \\pm 0.35)\\times 10^{-6}$, where\nthe uncertainties are statistical, systematic and due to the normalisation mode\n$B^{+}\\to D^{-} K^{+} \\pi^{+}$, respectively. The Dalitz plot appears to be\ndominated by broad structures. Angular distributions are exploited to search\nfor quasi-two-body contributions from $B^{+}\\to D^{*}_{2}(2460)^{0}K^{+}$ and\n$B^{+}\\to D^{+} K^{*}(892)^{0}$ decays. No significant signals are observed and\nupper limits are set on their branching fractions.\n", "  Using characters of finite group representations, we construct the fusion\nalgebras of operators of the spectrum of F- theory GUTs. These fusion relations\nare used in building monodromy invariant superpotentials of the low energy\neffective 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric GUT models.\n", "  We present an arbitrary-order spectral element method for general-purpose\nsimulation of non-overturning water waves, described by fully nonlinear\npotential theory. The method can be viewed as a high-order extension of the\nclassical finite element method proposed by Cai et al (1998)\n\\cite{CaiEtAl1998}, although the numerical implementation differs greatly.\nFeatures of the proposed spectral element method include: nodal Lagrange basis\nfunctions, a general quadrature-free approach and gradient recovery using\nglobal $L^2$ projections. The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov\nform of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and\nconsequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.\nWe show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of\nover-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a\nper element basis. This effectively removes any aliasing driven instabilities\nwhile retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional\ncomputational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to\nthe cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several\nbenchmark cases in two dimensions. The results confirm the high order accuracy\nof the model (exponential convergence), and demonstrate the potential for\naccuracy and speedup. The results of numerical experiments are in excellent\nagreement with both analytical and experimental results for strongly nonlinear\nand irregular dispersive wave propagation. The benefit of using a high-order --\npossibly adapted -- spatial discretization for accurate water wave propagation\nover long times and distances is particularly attractive for marine\nhydrodynamics applications.\n", "  When in a tight binary, the mutual tidal deformations of neutron stars\nimprint onto observables, encoding information about their internal structure\nat supranuclear densities and gravity in the extreme-gravity regime.\nGravitational wave observations of their late binary inspiral may serve as a\ntool to extract the individual tidal deformabilities, but this is made\ndifficult by degeneracies between them in the gravitational wave model. We here\nresolve this problem by discovering approximately universal relations between\ndimensionless combinations of the individual tidal deformabilities. We show\nthat these relations break degeneracies in the gravitational wave model,\nallowing for the accurate extraction of both deformabilities. Such measurements\ncan be used to better differentiate between equation-of-state models, and\nimprove tests of General Relativity and cosmology.\n", "  Black holes are real astrophysical objects, but their interiors are hidden\nand can only be \"observed\" through mathematics. The structure of rotating black\nholes is typically illustrated with the help of special coordinates. But any\nsuch coordinate choice necessarily results in a distorted view, just as the\nchoice of projection distorts a map of the Earth. The truest way to depict the\nproperties of a black hole is through quantities that are coordinate-invariant.\nWe compute and plot all the independent curvature invariants of rotating,\ncharged black holes for the first time, revealing a landscape that is much more\nbeautiful and complex than usually thought.\n", "  The classical quenched quark models with three constituent quarks provide a\ngood description for the baryon spatial ground states, but fail to reproduce\nthe spectrum of baryon excited states. More and more evidences suggest that\nunquenched effects with multi-quark dynamics are necessary ingredients to solve\nthe problem. Several new hyperon resonances reported recently could fit in the\npicture of penta-quark states. Based on this picture, some new hyperon excited\nstates were predicted to exist; meanwhile with extension from strangeness to\ncharm and beauty, super-heavy narrow $N^*$ and $\\Lambda^*$ resonances with\nhidden charm or beauty were predicted to be around 4.3 and 11 GeV,\nrespectively. Recently, two of such $N^*$ with hidden charm might have been\nobserved by the LHCb experiment. More of those states are expected to be\nobserved in near future. This opens a new window in order to study hadronic\ndynamics for the multi-quark states.\n", "  Within a formulation of $\\pi\\pi$ scattering, we investigate the use of the\nfinite-volume Hamiltonian approach to resolving scattering observables from\nlattice QCD spectra. We consider spectra in the centre-of-mass and moving\nframes for both S- and P-wave cases. Furthermore, we investigate the\nmulti-channel case. Here we study the use of the Hamiltonian framework as a\nparametrization that can be fit directly to lattice spectra. Through this\nmethod, the hadron properties, such as mass, width and coupling, can be\ndirectly extracted from the lattice spectra.\n", "  We take a central spin model (CSM), consisting of a one dimensional\nenvironmental Ising spin chain and a single qubit connected globally to all the\nspins of the environment, to study numerically the excess energy (EE) of the\nenvironment and the logarithm of decoherence factor namely, dynamical fidelity\nsusceptibility per site (DFSS), associated with the qubit under a periodic\ndriving of the transverse field term of environment across its critical point\nusing the Floquet technique. The coupling to the qubit, prepared in a pure\nstate, with the transverse field of the spin chain yields two sets of EE\ncorresponding to the two species of Floquet operators. In the limit of weak\ncoupling, we derive an approximated expression of DFSS after an infinite number\nof driving period which can successfully estimate the low and intermediate\nfrequency behavior of numerically obtained DFSS. Our main focus is to\nanalytically investigate the effect of system-environment coupling strength on\nthe EEs and DFSS and relate the behavior of DFSS to EEs as a function of\nfrequency by plausible analytical arguments. We explicitly show that the\nlow-frequency beating like pattern of DFSS is an outcome of two frequencies,\ncausing the oscillations in the two branches of EEs, that are dependent on the\ncoupling strength. In the intermediate frequency regime, dip structure observed\nin DFSS can be justified by the resonance peaks of EEs at those coupling\nparameter dependent frequencies; high frequency saturation value of EEs and\nDFSS are also connected to each other by the coupling strength.\n", "  The measurement was performed with circularly polarized photons incident on\nlongitudinally polarized target in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National\nAccelerator Facility. The helicity asymmetry E for\n$\\vec{\\gamma}\\vec{p}\\to\\pi^0p$ was determined at CM energies between 1450 MeV\nand 2050 MeV and compared to the SAID, MAID, and BnGa partial-wave analyses.\n", "  The original Parrondo game, denoted as AB3, contains two independent games: A\nand B. The winning or losing of A and B game is defined by the change of one\nunit of capital. Game A is a losing game if played continuously, with winning\nprobability $p=0.5-\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon=0.003$. Game B is also losing and\nit has two coins: a good coin with winning probability $p_g=0.75-\\epsilon$ is\nused if the player`s capital is not divisible by $3$, otherwise a bad coin with\nwinning probability $p_b=0.1-\\epsilon$ is used. Parrondo paradox refers to the\nsituation that the mixture of A and B game in a sequence leads to winning in\nthe long run. The paradox can be resolved using Markov chain analysis. We\nextend this setting of Parrondo game to involve players with one-step memory.\nThe player can win by switching his choice of A or B game in a Parrondo game\nsequence. If the player knows the identity of the game he plays and the state\nof his capital, then the player can win maximally. On the other hand, if the\nplayer does not know the nature of the game, then he is playing a (C,D) game,\nwhere either (C=A, D=B), or (C=B,D=A). For player with one-step memory playing\nthe AB3 game, he can achieve the highest expected gain with switching\nprobability equal to $3/4$ in the (C,D) game sequence. This result has been\nfound first numerically and then proven analytically. Generalization to AB\nmod($M$) Parrondo game for other integer $M$ has been made for the general\ndomain of parameters $p_b<p=0.5=p_A <p_g$. (please read the PDF file for full\nabstract)\n", "  Scaling equations for the Kondo lattice in the paramagnetic and magnetically\nordered phases are derived to two-loop order with account of spin dynamics. The\nresults are applied to describe various mechanisms of the non-Fermi-liquid\n(NFL) behavior in the multichannel Kondo-lattice model where a fixed point\noccurs in the weak-coupling region. The corresponding temperature dependences\nof electronic and magnetic properties are discussed. The model describes\nnaturally formation of a magnetic state with soft boson mode and small moment\nvalue. An important role of Van Hove singularities in the magnon spectral\nfunction is demonstrated. The results are rather sensitive to the type of\nmagnetic ordering and space dimensionality, the conditions for NFL behavior\nbeing more favorable in the antiferromagnetic and 2D cases.\n", "  The relativistic double neutron star binary PSR J0737-3039 shows clear\nevidence of orbital phase-dependent wind-companion interaction, both in radio\nand X-rays. In this paper we present the results of timing analysis of PSR\nJ0737-3039 performed during 2006 and 2011 XMM-Newton Large Programs that\ncollected ~20,000 X-ray counts from the system. We detected pulsations from PSR\nJ0737-3039A (PSR A) through the most accurate timing measurement obtained by\nXMM-Newton so far, the spin period error being of 2x10^-13 s. PSR A's pulse\nprofile in X-rays is very stable despite significant relativistic spin\nprecession that occurred within the time span of observations. This yields a\nconstraint on the misalignment between the spin axis and the orbital momentum\naxis Delta_A ~6.6^{+1.3}_{-5.4} deg, consistent with estimates based on radio\ndata. We confirmed pulsed emission from PSR J0737-3039B (PSR B) in X-rays even\nafter its disappearance in radio. The unusual phenomenology of PSR B's X-ray\nemission includes orbital pulsed flux and profile variations as well as a loss\nof pulsar phase coherence on time scales of years. We hypothesize that this is\ndue to the interaction of PSR A's wind with PSR B's magnetosphere and\norbital-dependent penetration of the wind plasma onto PSR B closed field lines.\nFinally, the analysis of the full XMM-Newton dataset provided evidences of\norbital flux variability (~7%) for the first time, involving a bow-shock\nscenario between PSR A's wind and PSR B's magnetosphere.\n", "  We review the results on the XYZ states from the Belle experiment, including\nthe measurement of inclusive hadronic cross sections and exclusive cross\nsections in e+e- annihilation and the Z_b states in the bottomonium energy\nregion; and the study of the Y states and the Z_c states in charmonium energy\nregion.\n", "  We present a product formula to approximate the exponential of a\nskew-Hermitian operator that is a sum of generators of a Lie algebra. The\nnumber of terms in the product depends on the structure factors. When the\ngenerators have large norm with respect to the dimension of the Lie algebra, or\nwhen the norm of the effective operator resulting from nested commutators is\nless than the product of the norms, the number of terms in the product is\nsignificantly less than that obtained from well-known results. We apply our\nresults to construct product formulas useful for the quantum simulation of some\ncontinuous-variable and bosonic physical systems, including systems whose\npotential is not quadratic. For many of these systems, we show that the number\nof terms in the product can be sublinear or subpolynomial in the dimension of\nthe relevant local Hilbert spaces, where such a dimension is usually determined\nby an energy scale of the problem. Our results emphasize the power of quantum\ncomputers for the simulation of various quantum systems.\n", "  The CHAMP magnetic field variations during international quiet days of low\nsolar activity period 2008-2009 are investigated. The present paper reports the\nexistence of frequency-peaks < 20 mHz in the compressional component of the\nmagnetic field in almost all CHAMP passes. The magnetic field variations\nassociated with these frequencies have amplitude of a few tens of nT during\ndaytime. The geomagnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field parameters\nwere observed to be low during the period of study. The spectral powers of the\nobserved frequencies show no dependence on solar wind velocity and cone angle;\nhence the reported frequencies are not related to the geomagnetic pulsations.\nFor frequency-peaks <15 mHz, strong local-time dependence is observed with\nmaximum power near noon and minimum at night. The longitudinal and seasonal\nvariations of the powers of these frequency-peaks match well with those of the\nequator-to-middle latitude ionospheric currents derived by the earlier studies.\nAs a polar Low-Earth-Orbiting (LEO) satellite spans the entire range of\nlatitudes within few minutes, it monitors the geomagnetic field variations\ncaused by the quiet-time ionospheric currents flowing at different latitudes.\nThis can result in certain frequencies in the magnetic field recorded by LEO\nsatellites. We demonstrate that the frequencies <10mHz are mainly due to the\nlatitudinal structure of the equatorial electrojet. The observed frequencies in\nCHAMP data are therefore attributed to the latitudinal structures of the\nionospheric currents that are monitored only by the polar LEO satellites and\nare found to alter the observations of geomagnetic pulsations (Pc4-5 and Pi2)\nsignificantly.\n", "  We study numerically the correlations and the distribution of intervals\nbetween successive zeros in the fluctuating geometry of stochastic interfaces,\ndescribed by the Edwards-Wilkinson equation. For equilibrium states we find\nthat the distribution of interval lengths satisfies a truncated Sparre-Andersen\ntheorem. We show that boundary-dependent finite-size effects induce non-trivial\ncorrelations, implying that the independent interval property is not exactly\nsatisfied in finite systems. For out-of-equilibrium non-stationary states we\nderive the scaling law describing the temporal evolution of the density of\nzeros starting from an uncorrelated initial condition. As a by-product we\nderive a general criterion of the Von Neumann's type to understand how\ndiscretization affects the stability of the numerical integration of stochastic\ninterfaces. We consider both diffusive and spatially fractional dynamics. Our\nresults provide an alternative experimental method for extracting universal\ninformation of fluctuating interfaces such as domain walls in thin ferromagnets\nor ferroelectrics, based exclusively on the detection of crossing points.\n", "  We analyze a solenoidal motion in a vertically vibrated freely suspended thin\nsmectic film. We demonstrate analytically that transverse oscillations of the\nfilm generate two-dimensional vortices in the plane of the film owing to\nhydrodynamic nonlinearity. An explicit expression for the vorticity of the\nin-plane film motion in terms of the film displacement is obtained. The air\naround the film is proven to play a crucial role, since it changes the\ndispersion relation of transverse oscillations and transmits viscous stresses\nto the film, modifying its bending motion. We propose possible experimental\nobservations enabling to check our predictions.\n", "  We present a new multi-component dark matter model with a novel experimental\nsignature that mimics neutral current interactions at neutrino detectors. In\nour model, the dark matter is composed of two particles, a heavier dominant\ncomponent that annihilates to produce a boosted lighter component that we refer\nto as boosted dark matter. The lighter component is relativistic and scatters\noff electrons in neutrino experiments to produce Cherenkov light. This model\ncombines the indirect detection of the dominant component with the direct\ndetection of the boosted dark matter. Directionality can be used to distinguish\nthe dark matter signal from the atmospheric neutrino background. We discuss the\nviable region of parameter space in current and future experiments.\n", "  We study Kaluza-Klein reduction in Newton-Cartan gravity. In particular we\nshow that dimensional reduction and the nonrelativistic limit commute. The\nresulting theory contains Galilean electromagnetism and a nonrelativistic\nscalar. It provides the first example of back-reacted couplings of scalar and\nvector matter to Newton-Cartan gravity. This back-reaction is interesting as it\nsources the spatial Ricci curvature, providing an example where nonrelativistic\ngravity is more than just a Newtonian potential.\n", "  Traditionally, galaxy clusters have been expected to retain all the material\naccreted since their formation epoch. For this reason, their matter content\nshould be representative of the Universe as a whole, and thus their baryon\nfraction should be close to the Universal baryon fraction. We make use of the\nsample of the 100 brightest galaxy clusters discovered in the XXL Survey to\ninvestigate the fraction of baryons in the form of hot gas and stars in the\ncluster population. We measure the gas masses of the detected halos and use a\nmass--temperature relation directly calibrated using weak-lensing measurements\nfor a subset of XXL clusters to estimate the halo mass. We find that the\nweak-lensing calibrated gas fraction of XXL-100-GC clusters is substantially\nlower than was found in previous studies using hydrostatic masses. Our best-fit\nrelation between gas fraction and mass reads $f_{\\rm\ngas,500}=0.055_{-0.006}^{+0.007}\\left(M_{\\rm\n500}/10^{14}M_\\odot\\right)^{0.21_{-0.10}^{+0.11}}$. The baryon budget of galaxy\nclusters therefore falls short of the Universal baryon fraction by about a\nfactor of two at $r_{\\rm 500}$. Our measurements require a hydrostatic bias\n$1-b=M_X/M_{\\rm WL}=0.72_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ to match the gas fraction obtained\nusing lensing and hydrostatic equilibrium. Comparing our gas fraction\nmeasurements with the expectations from numerical simulations, our results\nfavour an extreme feedback scheme in which a significant fraction of the\nbaryons are expelled from the cores of halos. This model is, however, in\ncontrast with the thermodynamical properties of observed halos, which might\nsuggest that weak-lensing masses are overestimated. We note that a mass bias\n$1-b=0.58$ as required to reconcile Planck CMB and cluster counts should\ntranslate into an even lower baryon fraction, which poses a major challenge to\nour current understanding of galaxy clusters. [Abridged]\n", "  The XXL Survey is the largest homogeneous survey carried out with XMM-Newton.\nCovering an area of 50 deg$^{2}$, the survey contains several hundred galaxy\nclusters out to a redshift of $\\approx$2 above an X-ray flux limit of\n$\\sim$5$\\times10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. This paper belongs to the first\nseries of XXL papers focusing on the bright cluster sample. We investigate the\nluminosity-temperature (LT) relation for the brightest clusters detected in the\nXXL Survey, taking fully into account the selection biases. We investigate the\nform of the LT relation, placing constraints on its evolution. We have\nclassified the 100 brightest clusters in the XXL Survey based on their measured\nX-ray flux. These 100 clusters have been analysed to determine their luminosity\nand temperature to evaluate the LT relation. We used three methods to fit the\nLT relation, with two of these methods providing a prescription to fully take\ninto account the selection effects of the survey. We measure the evolution of\nthe LT relation internally using the broad redshift range of the sample. Taking\ninto account selection effects, we find a slope of the bolometric LT relation\nof B$_{\\rm LT}=3.08\\pm$0.15, steeper than the self-similar expectation (B$_{\\rm\nLT}$=2). Our best-fit result for the evolution factor is $E(z)^{1.64\\pm0.77}$,\nconsistent with \"strong self-similar\" evolution where clusters scale\nself-similarly with both mass and redshift. However, this result is marginally\nstronger than \"weak self-similar\" evolution, where clusters scale with redshift\nalone. We investigate the sensitivity of our results to the assumptions made in\nour model, finding that using an external LT relation as a low-z baseline can\nhave a profound effect on the measured evolution. However, more clusters are\nneeded to break the degeneracy between the choice of likelihood model and\nmass-temperature relation on the derived evolution.\n", "  The temperature (T) dependent x-ray diffraction (XRD) and resistivity\nmeasurements of La0.175Pr0.45Ca0.375MnO3 (LPCMO) have been performed down to 2K\nto understand the structural and transport properties. From room temperature\ndown to 220K, LPCMO exists in orthorhombic phase with Pnma structure and at\n220K, it transforms to charge ordered (CO) monoclinic phase with P21/m\nstructure and remains as it is down to 2K. The CO phase is evident from the\noccurrence of weak but well defined superlattice peaks in the XRD pattern. This\nstructural transformation is of first order in nature as evident from the phase\ncoexistence across the transition region. These results thus clearly illustrate\nthat LPCMO undergoes a first order structural phase transition from charge\ndisordered orthorhombic phase to CO monoclinic phase at 220K, consistent with\ntemperature dependent resistivity results. Our structural analysis of T\ndependent XRD data using Rietveld refinement infers that below 220K, LPCMO\nforms commensurate CO monoclinic P21/m structure with four times structural\nmodulation.\n", "  We study the compositeness of unstable hadrons which lie near the two-hadron\nthreshold. In the framework of the effective field theory, we derive the\nrelation between the compositeness of stable bound states with observables. We\nthen extend this relation for the quasi-bound states with finite decay width. A\nprescription to interpret the complex value of the compositeness is presented.\nWith this method, we show that Lambda(1405) is dominated by the Kbar N\ncomposite component and a_0(980) have only small Kbar K fraction.\n", "  Internal mechanism leading to the emergence of the widely occurring 1/f noise\nstill remains an open issue. In this paper we investigate the distinction\nbetween internal time of the system and the physical time as a source of 1/f\nnoise. After demonstrating the appearance of 1/f noise in the earlier proposed\npoint process model, we generalize it starting from a stochastic differential\nequation which describes a Brownian-like motion in the internal (operational)\ntime. We consider this equation together with an additional equation relating\nthe internal time to the external (physical) time. We show that the relation\nbetween the internal time and the physical time that depends on the intensity\nof the signal can lead to 1/f noise in a wide interval of frequencies. The\npresent model can be useful for the explanation of the appearance of 1/f noise\nin different systems.\n", "  We investigate the role of the softening of the scalar-isoscalar (sigma)\nmeson in the $\\eta\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ and $3\\pi^0$ decay widths in the\nsymmetric nuclear medium using a linear sigma model. Our calculation shows that\nthese decay widths in the nuclear medium increase by up to a factor of four to\nten compared with those in the free space mainly depending on the mass of the\nsigma meson in the free space, which is an input parameter of the model. The\nenhancements are considerable even at a half of the normal nuclear density.\nThus, the $\\eta$ decay into $3\\pi$ could be a possible new probe for the chiral\nrestoration in the nuclear medium. We find that the density dependence of the\n$\\eta\\rightarrow3\\pi^0$ decay is moderate in comparison with that of\n$\\eta\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$, although the former width is greater than the\nlatter one at a given density. This is because the softening of the sigma meson\ncauses cancellation of the terms appearing from the Bose symmetry in the\n$\\eta\\rightarrow3\\pi^0$ decay. The difference between the density dependences\nshould be helpful for experimental confirmation of the findings of the present\nstudy.\n", "  A continuous model of double-walled carbon nanotube (DWCNT) low-frequency\ndynamics was constructed. In the frame of the approach proposed formation of a\nDWCNT low-frequency phonon spectrum from the ones of corresponding\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was considered. Environmental influence\non the individual DWCNT phonon spectrum was studied. A combined method of van\nder Waals interlayer coupling coefficients evaluation was proposed, and it is\nbased on Raman spectroscopy data and known values of graphite elastic moduli.\nAlso DWCNT low-temperature specific heat was calculated. In the model\napplicability region (at temperatures lower than 35 K) DWCNT specific heat\nturned out to be significantly lower than the specific heat sum of\ncorresponding individual single-walled SWCNTs. This effect is caused mainly by\nthe interlayer coupling instead of DWCNT interaction with environment.\n", "  Hadron spectroscopy is one of the most important physics goals of BESIII.\nBESIII brings great opportunities to study the XYZ states of charmonium by\ndirectly producing the Y states up to 4.6 GeV. High statistics of charmonium\ndecays collected at BESIII provide an excellent place for hunting gluonic\nexcitations and studying the excited baryons. Recent results of light hadron\nspectroscopy and charmonium spectroscopy from BESIII will be reported.\n", "  The ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI(Tl) Scintillators) experiment aims at\nthe confirmation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal using the same target and technique\nat the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). Along 2016, 112.5 kg of ultra\npure NaI(Tl) crystals will be installed at LSC in a 3x3 modules matrix\nconfiguration. The ANAIS-25 and ANAIS-37 set-ups have been taking data at the\nLSC testing the detector performance, the DAQ and analysis systems, and\nassessing the background. Main results coming from both set-ups will be\nsummarized in this paper, focusing on the excellent detector performance and\nbackground understanding. Prospects for the experiment will be also briefly\nrevised.\n", "  Context. The XXL Survey is the largest survey carried out by the XMM-Newton\nsatellite and covers a total area of 50 square degrees distributed over two\nfields. It primarily aims at investigating the large-scale structures of the\nUniverse using the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei\nas tracers of the matter distribution.\n  Aims. This article presents the XXL bright cluster sample, a subsample of 100\ngalaxy clusters selected from the full XXL catalogue by setting a lower limit\nof $3\\times 10^{-14}\\,\\mathrm{erg \\,s^{-1}cm^{-2}}$ on the source flux within a\n1$^{\\prime}$ aperture.\n  Methods. The selection function was estimated using a mixture of Monte Carlo\nsimulations and analytical recipes that closely reproduce the source selection\nprocess. An extensive spectroscopic follow-up provided redshifts for 97 of the\n100 clusters. We derived accurate X-ray parameters for all the sources. Scaling\nrelations were self-consistently derived from the same sample in other\npublications of the series. On this basis, we study the number density,\nluminosity function, and spatial distribution of the sample.\n  Results. The bright cluster sample consists of systems with masses between\n$M_{500}=7\\times 10^{13}$ and $3\\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$, mostly located between\n$z=0.1$ and 0.5. The observed sky density of clusters is slightly below the\npredictions from the WMAP9 model, and significantly below the predictions from\nthe Planck 2015 cosmology. In general, within the current uncertainties of the\ncluster mass calibration, models with higher values of $\\sigma_8$ and/or\n$\\Omega_m$ appear more difficult to accommodate. We provide tight constraints\non the cluster differential luminosity function and find no hint of evolution\nout to $z\\sim1$. We also find strong evidence for the presence of large-scale\nstructures in the XXL bright cluster sample and identify five new\nsuperclusters.\n", "  We present the XXL Survey, the largest XMM programme totaling some 6.9 Ms to\ndate and involving an international consortium of roughly 100 members. The XXL\nSurvey covers two extragalactic areas of 25 deg2 each at a point-source\nsensitivity of ~ 5E-15 erg/sec/cm2 in the [0.5-2] keV band (completeness\nlimit). The survey's main goals are to provide constraints on the dark energy\nequation of state from the space-time distribution of clusters of galaxies and\nto serve as a pathfinder for future, wide-area X-ray missions. We review\nscience objectives, including cluster studies, AGN evolution, and large-scale\nstructure, that are being conducted with the support of approximately 30\nfollow-up programmes. We describe the 542 XMM observations along with the\nassociated multi-lambda and numerical simulation programmes. We give a detailed\naccount of the X-ray processing steps and describe innovative tools being\ndeveloped for the cosmological analysis. The paper provides a thorough\nevaluation of the X-ray data, including quality controls, photon statistics,\nexposure and background maps, and sky coverage. Source catalogue construction\nand multi-lambda associations are briefly described. This material will be the\nbasis for the calculation of the cluster and AGN selection functions, critical\nelements of the cosmological and science analyses. The XXL multi-lambda data\nset will have a unique lasting legacy value for cosmological and extragalactic\nstudies and will serve as a calibration resource for future dark energy studies\nwith clusters and other X-ray selected sources. With the present article, we\nrelease the XMM XXL photon and smoothed images along with the corresponding\nexposure maps. The XMM XXL observation list (Table B.1) is available in\nelectronic form at the CDS. The present paper is the first in a series\nreporting results of the XXL-XMM survey.\n", "  We present 2.1 GHz imaging with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)\nof a 6.5 deg^2 region within the XXM-Newton XXL South field using a band of\n1.1-3.1 GHz. We achieve an angular resolution of 4.7\" x 4.2\" in the final radio\ncontinuum map with a median rms noise level of 50 uJy/beam. We identify 1389\nradio sources in the field with peak S/N >=5 and present the catalogue of\nobserved parameters. We find that 305 sources are resolved, of which 77 consist\nof multiple radio components. These number counts are in agreement with those\nfound for the COSMOS-VLA 1.4 GHz survey. We derive spectral indices by a\ncomparison with the Sydney University Molongolo Sky Survey (SUMSS) 843MHz data.\nWe find an average spectral index of -0.78 and a scatter of 0.28, in line with\nexpectations. This pilot survey was conducted in preparation for a larger ATCA\nprogram to observe the full 25 deg^2 southern XXL field. When complete, the\nsurvey will provide a unique resource of sensitive, wide-field radio continuum\nimaging with complementary X-ray data in the field. This will facilitate\nstudies of the physical mechanisms of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs and\ngalaxy clusters, and the role they play in galaxy evolution. The source\ncatalogue is publicly available online via the XXL Master Catalogue browser and\nthe Centre de Donn\\'ees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS).\n", "  We report on the large-scale synthesis of highly oriented ultrathin MoO3\nlayers using a simple and low-cost atmospheric pressure by van der Waals\nepitaxy growth on muscovite mica substrates. By this method we are able to\nsynthetize high quality centimeter-scale MoO3 crystals with thicknesses ranging\nfrom 1.4 nm (two layers) up to a few nanometers. The crystals can be easily\ntransferred to an arbitrary substrate (such as SiO2) by a deterministic\ntransfer method and extensively characterized to demonstrate the high quality\nof the resulting crystal. We also study the electronic band structure of the\nmaterial by density functional theory calculations. Interestingly, the\ncalculations demonstrate that bulk MoO3 has a rather weak electronic interlayer\ninteraction and thus it presents a monolayer-like band structure. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the potential of this synthesis method for optoelectronic\napplications by fabricating large-area field-effect devices (10 micrometers by\n110 micrometers in lateral dimensions), finding responsivities of 30 mA/W for a\nlaser power density of 13 mW/cm2 in the UV region of the spectrum and also as\nan electron acceptor in a MoS2-based field-effect transistor.\n", "  The XXL Survey is the largest homogeneous and contiguous survey carried out\nwith XMM-Newton. Covering an area of 50 square degrees distributed over two\nfields, it primarily investigates the large-scale structures of the Universe\nusing the distribution of galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei as tracers\nof the matter distribution. Given its depth and sky coverage, XXL is\nparticularly suited to systematically unveiling the clustering of X-ray\nclusters and to identifying superstructures in a homogeneous X-ray sample down\nto the typical mass scale of a local massive cluster. A friends-of-friends\nalgorithm in three-dimensional physical space was run to identify large-scale\nstructures. In this paper we report the discovery of the highest redshift\nsupercluster of galaxies found in the XXL Survey. We describe the X-ray\nproperties of the clusters members of the structure and the optical follow-up.\nThe newly discovered supercluster is composed of six clusters of galaxies at a\nmedian redshift z around 0.43 and distributed across approximately 30 by 15 arc\nminutes (10 by 5 Mpc on sky) on the sky. This structure is very compact with\nall the clusters residing in one XMM pointing; for this reason this is the\nfirst supercluster discovered with the XXL Survey. Spectroscopic follow-up with\nWHT (William Herschel Telescope) and NTT (New Technology Telescope) confirmed a\nmedian redshift of z = 0.43. An estimate of the X-ray mass and luminosity of\nthis supercluster and of its total gas mass put XLSSC-e at the average mass\nrange of superclusters; its appearance, with two members of equal size, is\nquite unusual with respect to other superclusters and provides a unique view of\nthe formation process of a massive structure.\n", "  The past decade witnessed the observation of several exotic charmonium-like\nresonances, some of which are manifestly non-qqbar mesons. We review one of the\nmost popular interpretations of such states: the compact tetraquark in the\nconstituent diquark-antidiquark picture. Moreover, we discuss some unexplored\ndecay channels which are particularly sensitive to the different\nphenomenological models and could therefore shed some light on the nature of\nthese fascinating states. Some brief comments on the recently observed\npentaquarks are also included.\n", "  It is well established that elemental abundances vary in the solar atmosphere\nand that this variation is organized by first ionization potential (FIP).\nPrevious studies have shown that in the solar corona low-FIP elements, such as\nFe, Si, Mg, and Ca, are generally enriched relative to high-FIP elements, such\nas C, N, O, Ar, and Ne. In this paper we report on measurements of plasma\ncomposition made during impulsive heating events observed at transition region\ntemperatures with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Hinode.\nDuring these events the intensities of O IV, V, and VI emission lines are\nenhanced relative to emission lines from Mg V, VI, and VII and Si VI and VII\nand indicate a composition close to that of the photosphere. Long-lived coronal\nfan structures, in contrast, show an enrichment of low-FIP elements. We\nconjecture that the plasma composition is an important signature of the coronal\nheating process, with impulsive heating leading to the evaporation of\nunfractionated material from the lower layers of the solar atmosphere and\nhigher frequency heating leading to long-lived structures and the accumulation\nof low-FIP elements in the corona.\n", "  A novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, the magnetic shear-current effect, is\ndiscussed and explored. The effect relies on the interaction of magnetic\nfluctuations with a mean shear flow, meaning the saturated state of the\nsmall-scale dynamo can drive a large-scale dynamo -- in some sense the inverse\nof dynamo quenching. The dynamo is nonhelical, with the mean-field $\\alpha$\ncoefficient zero, and is caused by the interaction between an off-diagonal\ncomponent of the turbulent resistivity and the stretching of the large-scale\nfield by shear flow. Following up on previous numerical and analytic work, this\npaper presents further details of the numerical evidence for the effect, as\nwell as an heuristic description of how magnetic fluctuations can interact with\nshear flow to produce the required electromotive force. The pressure response\nof the fluid is fundamental to this mechanism, which helps explain why the\nmagnetic effect is stronger than its kinematic cousin, and the basic idea is\nrelated to the well-known lack of turbulent resistivity quenching by magnetic\nfluctuations. As well as being interesting for its applications to general high\nReynolds number astrophysical turbulence, where strong small-scale magnetic\nfluctuations are expected to be prevalent, the magnetic shear-current effect is\na likely candidate for large-scale dynamo in the unstratified regions of\nionized accretion disks. Evidence for this is discussed, as well as future\nresearch directions and the challenges involved with understanding details of\nthe effect in astrophysically relevant regimes.\n", "  Nodal topological superconductors display zero-energy Majorana flat bands at\ngeneric edges. The flatness of these edge bands, which is protected by\ntime-reversal and translation symmetry, gives rise to an extensive ground-state\ndegeneracy. Therefore, even arbitrarily weak interactions lead to an\ninstability of the flat-band edge states towards time-reversal and\ntranslation-symmetry-broken phases, which lift the ground-state degeneracy. We\nexamine the instabilities of the flat-band edge states of d_{xy}-wave\nsuperconductors by performing a mean-field analysis in the Majorana basis of\nthe edge states. The leading instabilities are Majorana mass terms, which\ncorrespond to coherent superpositions of particle-particle and particle-hole\nchannels in the fermionic language. We find that attractive interactions induce\nthree different mass terms. One is a coherent superposition of imaginary s-wave\npairing and current order, and another combines a charge-density-wave and\nfinite-momentum singlet pairing. Repulsive interactions, on the other hand,\nlead to ferromagnetism together with spin-triplet pairing at the edge. Our\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings and demonstrate that\nthese instabilities occur even in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations.\nWe discuss the implications of our results for experiments on cuprate\nhigh-temperature superconductors.\n", "  The PICO-LON project aims at search for cold dark matter by means of highly\nradio-pure and large volume NaI(Tl) scintillator. The NaI powder was purifed by\nchemical processing to remove lead isotopes and selecting a high purity\ngraphite crucible. The concentrations of radioactive impurities of $^{226}$Ra\nand $^{228}$Th were effectively reduced to 58$\\pm$4 $\\mu$Bq/kg and 1.5$\\pm$1.9\n$\\mu$Bq/kg, respectively. It should be remarked that the concentration of\n$^{210}$Pb, which is crucial for the sensitivity to dark matter, was reduced to\n24$\\pm$2 $\\mu$Bq/kg. The total background rate at 10 keVee was as low as 8\nkeV$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$day$^{-1}$, which was sufficiently low to search for dark\nmatter. Further purification of NaI(Tl) ingot and future prospect of PICO-LON\nproject is discussed.\n", "  The observation of many unexpected states decaying into heavy quarkonia has\nchallenged the usual QQbar interpretation. One of the most studied exotic\nstates, the X(3872), happens to be copiously produced in high-energy hadron\ncollisions. We discuss how this large prompt production cross-section disfavors\na loosely-bound molecule interpretation for this particle. This is supported by\nMonte Carlo simulations, and by a comparison with extrapolated light nuclei\ndata by ALICE.\n", "  Human movements in the real world and in cyberspace affect not only dynamical\nprocesses such as epidemic spreading and information diffusion but also social\nand economical activities such as urban planning and personalized\nrecommendation in online shopping. Despite recent efforts in characterizing and\nmodeling human behaviors in both the real and cyber worlds, the fundamental\ndynamics underlying human mobility have not been well understood. We develop a\nminimal, memory-based random walk model in limited space for reproducing, with\na single parameter, the key statistical behaviors characterizing human\nmovements in both spaces. The model is validated using big data from mobile\nphone and online commerce, suggesting memory-based random walk dynamics as the\nuniversal underpinning for human mobility, regardless of whether it occurs in\nthe real world or in cyberspace.\n", "  The current status of the Lambda(1405) resonance in the Kbar N scattering is\nsummarized. It is shown that the precise experimental data and the theoretical\ndevelopments in chiral SU(3) dynamics enable us to quantitatively understand\nthe physics around the Kbar N threshold. We present the recent theoretical\npredictions of the pi Sigma spectrum and the investigations of the internal\nstructure of the Lambda(1405).\n", "  Ionization of the final ${}^{3}$He$^{+}$ ion during the nuclear\n$\\beta^{-}$-decay of the tritium atom is discussed.

A striking feature of boron is that B12 icosahedral\ncages occur as the building blocks in bulk boron and many boron compounds. This\nis in contrast to its neighboring element, carbon, which prefers 2D layered\nstructure (graphite) in its bulk form. On the other hand, boron clusters of\nmedium size have been predicted to be planar or quasi-planar, such as B12+ ,\nB13+, B19-, B36, and so on. This is also in contrast to carbon clusters which\nexhibit various cage structures (fullerenes). Therefore, boron and carbon can\nbe viewed as a set of complementary chemical systems in their bulk and cluster\nstructures. Now, with the boom of graphene, an intriguing question is that\nwhether boron can also form a monoatomic-layer 2D sheet structure? Here, we\nreport the first successful experimental realization of 2D boron sheets. We\nhave revealed two types of boron sheet structures, corresponding to a\ntriangular boron lattice with different arrangements of the hexagonal holes.\nMoreover, our boron sheets were found to be relatively stable against\noxidization, and interacts only weekly with the substrate. The realization of\nsuch a long expected 2D boron sheet could open a door toward boron electronics,\nin analogous to the carbon electronics based on graphene.\n", "  This article provides a brief introductory account of the theory of aperiodic\norder.\n", "  The high energy part of the hadron spin flip amplitude is examined in the\nframework of the new high energy general structure (HEGS) model of the elastic\nhadron scattering at high energies. The different forms of the hadron spin flip\namplitude are compared in the impact parameters representation. It is shown\nthat the existing experimental data of the proton-proton and proton-antiproton\nelastic scattering at high energy in the region of the diffraction minimum and\nat large momentum transfer give support in the presence of the\nenergy-independent part of the hadron spin flip amplitude with the momentum\ndependence proposed in the works by Galynskii-Kuraev.\n", "  These lecture notes contain an elementary introduction to lattice QCD at\nnonzero chemical potential. Topics discussed include chemical potential in the\ncontinuum and on the lattice; the sign, overlap and Silver Blaze problems; the\nphase boundary at small chemical potential; imaginary chemical potential; and\ncomplex Langevin dynamics. An incomplete overview of other approaches is\npresented as well. These lectures are meant for postgraduate students and\npostdocs with an interest in extreme QCD. A basic knowledge of lattice QCD is\nassumed but not essential. Some exercises are included at the end.\n", "  A model for laser light absorption in electron-positron plasmas\nself-consistently created via QED cascades is described. The laser energy is\nmainly absorbed due to hard photon emission via nonlinear Compton scattering.\nThe degree of absorption depends on the laser intensity and the pulse duration.\nThe QED cascades are studied with multi-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations complemented by a QED module and a macro-particle merging algorithm\nthat allows to handle the exponential growth of the number of particles.\nResults range from moderate-intensity regimes ($\\sim$ 10 PW) where the laser\nabsorption is negligible, to extreme intensities (> 100 PW) where the degree of\nabsorption reaches 80%. Our study demonstrates good agreement between the\nanalytical model and simulations. The expected properties of the hard photon\nemission and the generated pair-plasma are investigated, and the experimental\nsignatures for near-future laser facilities are discussed.\n", "  Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice\nwith remarkable mechanical and electrical properties. Regarded as the thinnest\nand narrowest conductive mesh, it has drastically different transmission\nbehaviours when bombarded with electrons and ions in vacuum. This property, if\nconfirmed in gas, may be a definitive solution for the ion back-flow problem in\ngaseous detectors. In order to ascertain this aspect, graphene layers of\ndimensions of about 2x2cm$^2$, grown on a copper substrate, are transferred\nonto a flat metal surface with holes, so that the graphene layer is freely\nsuspended. The graphene and the support are installed into a gaseous detector\nequipped with a triple Gaseous Electron Multiplier (GEM), and the transparency\nproperties to electrons and ions are studied in gas as a function of the\nelectric fields. The techniques to produce the graphene samples are described,\nand we report on preliminary tests of graphene-coated GEMs.\n", "  We study mathematical models describing the evolution of stochastic\nage-structured populations. After reviewing existing approaches, we present a\nfull kinetic framework for age-structured interacting populations undergoing\nbirth, death and fission processes, in spatially dependent environments. We\ndefine the complete probability density for the population-size-age-chart and\nfind results under specific conditions. Connections with more classical models\nare also explicitly derived. In particular, we show that factorial moments for\nnon-interacting processes are described by a natural generalization of the\nMcKendrick-von Foerster equation, which describes mean-field deterministic\nbehaviour. Our approach utilizes mixed type, multi-dimensional probability\ndistributions similar to those employed in the study of gas kinetics, with\nterms that satisfy BBGKY-like equation hierarchies.\n", "  Charm and charmonium physics have gained renewed interest in the past decade.\nRecent spectroscopic observations strongly motivate these studies. Among the\nseveral possible reactions, measurements in proton-antiproton annihilation play\nan important role, complementary to the studies performed at B-factories. The\nfixed target PANDA experiment at FAIR (Darmstadt, Germany) will investigate\nfundamental questions of hadron and nuclear physics in the interactions of\nantiprotons with nucleons and nuclei. With reaction rates as large as 2*10^7\ninteractions/s, and a mass resolution 20 times better as compared with the most\nrecent B-factories, PANDA is in a privileged position to successfully perform\nthe measurement of the width of narrow states, such as the X(3872). PANDA will\ninvestigate also high spin particles, whose observation was forbidden at\nB-factories, i.e. F-wave charmonium states. In this report extrapolations on\ncross sections and rates with PANDA are given.\n", "  The present day experimental data on the $X(3872)$ decays do not allow to\nmake clear conclusions on the dominating structure of this state. We discuss\nhere an alternative way to study its structure by means of the two-step $\\bar\nD^*$ (or $D$) production in $\\bar p A$ reactions. If this process is mediated\nby $X(3872)$, the characteristic narrow peaks of the $\\bar D^*$ (or $D$)\ndistributions in the light cone momentum fraction at small transverse momenta\nwill appear. This would unambiguously signal the $D \\bar D^*$ + c.c. molecular\ncomposition of the $X(3872)$ state.\n", "  Lattice calculations for hadrons are now entering the domain of resonances\nand scattering, necessitating a better understanding of the observed discrete\nenergy spectrum. This is a reviewing survey about recent lattice QCD results,\nwith some emphasis on spectrum and scattering.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS groups have recently reported an excess at around 750 GeV\nwith the local significance by about 3 sigma in the diphoton channel at the 13\nTeV LHC. We give a possible explanation for the excess by a composite pseudo\nscalar $(P^0)$ predicted in the one-family model of walking technicolor.\n", "  Taking on a new perspective of the electroweak phase transition, we\ninvestigate in detail the role played by the depth of the electroweak minimum\n(\"vacuum energy difference\"). We find a strong correlation between the vacuum\nenergy difference and the strength of the phase transition. This correlation\nonly breaks down if a negative eigenvalue develops upon thermal corrections in\nthe squared scalar mass matrix in the broken vacuum before the critical\ntemperature. As a result the scalar fields slide across field space toward the\nsymmetric vacuum, often causing a significantly weakened phase transition.\nPhenomenological constraints are found to strongly disfavour such sliding\nscalar scenarios. For several popular models, we suggest numerical bounds that\nguarantee a strong first order electroweak phase transition. The zero\ntemperature phenomenology can then be studied in these parameter regions\nwithout the need for any finite temperature calculations. For almost all\nnon-supersymmetric models with phenomenologically viable parameter points, we\nfind a strong phase transition is guaranteed if the vacuum energy difference is\ngreater than $-8.8\\times 10^7$~\\text{GeV}$^4$. For the GNMSSM, we guarantee a\nstrong phase transition for phenomenologically viable parameter points if the\nvacuum energy difference is greater than $-6.9\\times 10^7$~\\text{GeV}$^4$.\nAlternatively, we capture more of the parameter space exhibiting a strong phase\ntransition if we impose a simultaneous bound on the vacuum energy difference\nand the singlet mass.\n", "  We point out that the diphoton excess at about 750 GeV recently discovered by\nthe LHC experiments can be explained within supersymmetric models with low\nscale supersymmetry breaking with sgoldstino as a natural candidate. We discuss\nphenomenological consequences of this scenario describing possible signatures\nto test this hypothesis.\n", "  NASA's exoplanet Discovery mission Kepler was reconstituted as the K2 mission\na year after the failure of the 2nd of Kepler's 4 reaction wheels in May 2013.\nThe new spacecraft pointing method now gives typical roll motion of 1.0 pixels\npeak-to-peak over 6 hours at the edges of the field, two orders of magnitude\ngreater than for Kepler. Despite these roll errors, the flight system and its\nmodified science data processing pipeline restores much of the photometric\nprecision of the primary mission while viewing a wide variety of targets, thus\nturning adversity into diversity. We define metrics for data compression and\npixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet\ntransit and stellar activity time scales; residual correlations in corrected\nlong cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from\noverfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data\ncompression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the\ncenter of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star\ncount as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the\nlimiting 6 hour photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as\nlow as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is\nachieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the\ndata are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up 15 days. At\ntime scales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive\ncalibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40% of that\nachieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis\nresulting from 1.5 yr of experience with this new mission concept, and\nquantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's\nalready high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.\n", "  Monolayer FeSe films grown on SrTiO3 (STO) substrate show superconducting\ngap-opening temperatures (Tc) which are almost an order of magnitude higher\nthan those of the bulk FeSe and are highest among all known Fe-based\nsuperconductors. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) observed\n\"replica bands\" suggesting the importance of the interaction between FeSe\nelectrons and STO phonons. These facts rejuvenated the quest for Tc enhancement\nmechanisms in iron-based, especially iron-chalcogenide, superconductors. Here,\nwe perform the first numerically-exact sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations to iron-based superconductors. We (i) study the electronic pairing\nmechanism intrinsic to heavily electron doped FeSe films, and (ii) examine the\neffects of electron-phonon interaction between FeSe and STO as well as nematic\nfluctuations on Tc. Armed with these results, we return to the question \"what\nmakes the Tc of monolayer FeSe on SrTiO3 so high?\" in the conclusion and\ndiscussions.\n", "  We consider a dynamical phase transition induced by a short optical pulse in\na system prone to thermodynamical instability. We address the case of pumping\nto excitons whose density contributes directly to the order parameter. To\ndescribe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on equal footing, we adopt a\nview of the excitonic insulator for the phase transition and suggest a\nformation of the Bose condensate for the pumped excitons. The work is motivated\nby experiments in donor-acceptor organic compounds with a neutral-ionic phase\ntransition coupled to the spontaneous lattice dimerization and to charge\ntransfer excitons. The double nature of the ensemble of excitons leads to an\nintricate time evolution, in particular to macroscopic quantum oscillations\nfrom the interference between the Bose condensate of excitons and the ground\nstate of the excitonic insulator. The coupling of excitons and the order\nparameter also leads to self-trapping of their wave function, akin to\nself-focusing in optics. The locally enhanced density of excitons can surpass a\ncritical value to trigger the phase transformation, even if the mean density is\nbelow the required threshold. The system is stratified in domains that evolve\nthrough dynamical phase transitions and sequences of merging.\n", "  I compare the non-relativistic effective theory of one-body dark\nmatter-nucleon interactions to current dark matter direct detection experiments\nand neutrino telescope observations, presenting exclusion limits on the\ncoupling constants of the theory. In the analysis of direct detection\nexperiments, I focus on the interference of different dark matter-nucleon\ninteraction operators and on predictions observable at directional detectors.\nInterpreting neutrino telescope observations, I use new nuclear response\nfunctions recently derived through nuclear structure calculations and show that\nhydrogen is not the most important element in the exclusion limit calculation\nfor the majority of the spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon interaction\noperators\n", "  Superconductivity in disordered systems close to an incipient localization\ntransition has been an area of investigation for many years. It has been noted\nthat in such highly disordered superconductors, anomalous spectral weight\ndevelops in their conductivity near and below the superconducting gap energy.\nIn this work we investigate the low frequency conductivity in disordered\nsuperconducting NbN thin films close to the localization transition with\ntime-domain terahertz spectroscopy. In the normal state, strong deviations from\nthe Drude form due to incipient localization are found. In the superconducting\nstate we find substantial spectral weight at frequencies well below the\nsuperconducting gap scale derived from tunneling. We analyze this spectral\nweight in the context of a model of disorder induced broadening of the\nquasiparticle density of states and effective pair-breaking. We find that\nalthough aspects of the optical and tunneling data can be consistently modeled\nin terms of this effect of mesoscopic disorder, the optical conductivity\nreturns to the normal state value much faster than any model predicts. This\npoints to the non-trivial interplay of superconductivity and disorder close to\nlocalization.\n", "  We retrieve depth information (moments) of an object using partially coherent\nfields and defocus induced holographic contrast. Our analysis leads to a form\nof tomography that does not require sample or source rotation. The tomography\nmethod presented here is performed with only two in-line images.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy on the fuzzy sphere. We calculate it in a\nscalar field theory on the fuzzy sphere, which is given by a matrix model. We\nuse a method that is based on the replica method and applicable to interacting\nfields as well as free fields. For free fields, we obtain the results\nconsistent with the previous study, which serves as a test of the validity of\nthe method. For interacting fields, we perform Monte Carlo simulations at\nstrong coupling and see a novel behavior of entanglement entropy.\n", "  The AMADEUS experiment deals with the investigation of the low-energy\nkaon-nuclei hadronic interaction at the DA{\\Phi}NE collider at LNF-INFN, which\nis fundamental to respond longstanding questions in the non-perturbative QCD\nstrangeness sector. The antikaon-nucleon potential is investigated searching\nfor signals from possible bound kaonic clusters, which would open the\npossibility for the formation of cold dense baryonic matter. The confirmation\nof this scenario may imply a fundamental role of strangeness in astrophysics.\nAMADEUS step 0 consisted in the reanalysis of 2004/2005 KLOE dataset,\nexploiting K- absorptions in H, 4He, 9Be and 12C in the setup materials. In\nthis paper, together with a review on the multi-nucleon K- absorption and the\nparticle identification procedure, the first results on the {\\Sigma}0-p channel\nwill be presented including a statistical analysis on the possible accomodation\nof a deeply bound state\n", "  It was recently shown [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 110}, 227201 (2013)] that the\ncritical behavior of the random-field Ising model in three dimensions is ruled\nby a single universality class. This conclusion was reached only after a proper\ntaming of the large scaling corrections of the model by applying a combined\napproach of various techniques, coming from the zero- and positive-temperature\ntoolboxes of statistical physics. In the present contribution we provide a\ndetailed description of this combined scheme, explaining in detail the\nzero-temperature numerical scheme and developing the generalized\nfluctuation-dissipation formula that allowed us to compute connected and\ndisconnected correlation functions of the model. We discuss the error evolution\nof our method and we illustrate the infinite limit-size extrapolation of\nseveral observables within phenomenological renormalization. We present an\nextension of the quotients method that allows us to obtain estimates of the\ncritical exponent $\\alpha$ of the specific heat of the model via the scaling of\nthe bond energy and we discuss the self-averaging properties of the system and\nthe algorithmic aspects of the maximum-flow algorithm used.\n", "  We discuss and develop some connections between analysis on singular spaces\nand operator algebras, as presented in my sequence of four lectures at the\nconference \"Noncommutative geometry and applications,\" Frascati, Italy, June\n16-21, 2014. Therefore this paper is mostly a survey paper, but the\npresentation is new, and there are included some new results as well. In\nparticular, Sections 3 and 4 provide a complete short introduction to analysis\non noncompact manifolds that is geared towards a class of manifolds--called\n\"Lie manifolds\"--that often appears in practice. Our interest in Lie manifolds\nis due to the fact that they provide the link between analysis on singular\nspaces and operator algebras. The groupoids integrating Lie manifolds play an\nimportant background role in establishing this link because they provide\noperator algebras whose structure is often well understood. The initial\nmotivation for the work surveyed here--work that spans over close to two\ndecades--was to develop the index theory of stratified singular spaces.\nMeanwhile, several other applications have emerged as well, including\napplications to Partial Differential Equations and Numerical Methods. These\nwill be mentioned only briefly, however, due to the lack of space. Instead, we\nshall concentrate on the applications to Index theory.\n", "  We compare the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble\nto its non-hermitian counterpart - for the complex Ginibre ensemble. We exploit\nthe mathematical framework based on the generalized Green's functions, which\ninvolves a new, hidden complex variable, in comparison to the standard\ntreatment of the resolvents. This new variable turns out to be crucial to\nunderstand the pattern of the evolution of non-hermitian systems. The new\nfeature is the emergence of the coupling between the flow of eigenvalues and\nthat of left/right eigenvectors. We analyze local and global equilibria for\nboth systems. Finally, we highlight some unexpected links between both\nensembles.\n", "  In this paper, we extend the Fritzsch ansatz of quark mass matrices while\nretaining their hierarchical structures and show that the main features of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix $V$, including $|V^{}_{us}| \\simeq\n|V^{}_{cd}|$, $|V^{}_{cb}| \\simeq |V^{}_{ts}|$ and $|V^{}_{ub}|/|V^{}_{cb}| <\n|V^{}_{td}|/|V^{}_{ts}|$, can be well understood. This agreement is observed\nespecially when the mass matrices have non-vanishing $(1,3)$ and $(3,1)$\noff-diagonal elements. The phenomenological consequences of these for the\nallowed texture content and gross structural features of `hierarchical' quark\nmass matrices are addressed from a model independent prospective under the\nassumption of factorizable phases in these. The approximate and analytical\nexpressions of the CKM matrix elements are derived, and a detailed analysis\nreveals that such structures are in good agreement with the observed quark\nflavor mixing angles and the CP-violating phase at the $1\\sigma$ level and call\nupon a further investigation of the realization of these structures from a\ntop-down prospective.\n", "  We present a formalism for strongly correlated systems with fermions coupled\nto bosonic modes. We construct the three-particle irreducible functional\n$\\mathcal{K}$ by successive Legendre transformations of the free energy of the\nsystem. We derive a closed set of equations for the fermionic and bosonic\nself-energies for a given $\\mathcal{K}$. We then introduce a local\napproximation for $\\mathcal{K}$, which extends the idea of dynamical mean field\ntheory (DMFT) approaches from two- to three-particle irreducibility. This\napproximation entails the locality of the three-leg electron-boson vertex\n$\\Lambda(i\\omega,i\\Omega)$, which is self-consistently computed using a quantum\nimpurity model with dynamical charge and spin interactions. This local vertex\nis used to construct frequency- and momentum-dependent electronic self-energies\nand polarizations. By construction, the method interpolates between the\nspin-fluctuation or GW approximations at weak coupling and the atomic limit at\nstrong coupling. We apply it to the Hubbard model on two-dimensional square and\ntriangular lattices. We complement the results of Phys.Rev. B 92, 115109 by (i)\nshowing that, at half-filling, as DMFT, the method describes the Fermi-liquid\nmetallic state and the Mott insulator, separated by a first-order\ninteracting-driven Mott transition at low temperatures, (ii) investigating the\ninfluence of frustration and (iii) discussing the influence of the bosonic\ndecoupling channel.\n", "  The recent reported 750 GeV diphoton excess at the 13 TeV LHC is explained in\nthe framework of effective field theory assuming the diphoton resonance is a\nscalar (pseudoscalar) particle. It is found that the large production rate and\nthe broad width of this resonance are hard to simultaneously explain if only\nvisible final states are considered. Therefore an invisible decay channel to\ndark matter (DM) is strongly favored by the diphoton excess with a broad width,\ngiven a large coupling of the new scalar to DM. We set constraints on the\nparameter space in this scenario using the results from LHC Run 1, DM relic\ndensity, and DM direct and indirect detection experiments. We find that the DM\nsearches can exclude a large portion of the parameter regions accounting for\nthe diphoton excess with a broad width.\n", "  We summarize the determination of some neutrino properties from the global\nanalysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrino data in the\nframework of three-neutrino mixing as well as in some extended scenarios such\nas the mixing with eV-scale sterile neutrinos invoked for the interpretation of\nthe short baseline anomalies, and the presence of non-standard neutrino\ninteractions.\n", "  Following a Letter of Intent submitted to PAC43 at JLab in this talk we\ndiscuss the possibility to create a secondary K0_L beam in Hall-D to be used\nwith GlueX detector for spectroscopy of excited hyperons.\n", "  We compute the distribution amplitudes of the pion and kaon in the\nlight-front constituent quark model with the symmetric quark-bound state vertex\nfunction. In the calculation we explicitly include the flavor-SU(3) symmetry\nbreaking effect in terms of the constituent quark masses of the up (down) and\nstrange quarks. To calculate the kaon parton distribution functions~(PDFs), we\nuse both the conditions in the light-cone wave function, i.e., when $\\bar{s}$\nquark is on-shell, and when $u$ quark is on-shell, and make a comparison\nbetween them. The kaon PDFs calculated in the two different conditions clearly\nshow asymmetric behaviour due to the flavor SU(3)-symmetry breaking implemented\nby the quark masses.\n", "  In light of the recent 750 GeV diphoton anomaly observed at the LHC, we study\nthe possibility of accommodating the deviation from the standard model\nprediction based on the recently proposed Gauged Two Higgs Doublet Model. The\nmodel embeds two Higgs doublets into a doublet of a non-abelian gauge group\n$SU(2)_H$, while the standard model $SU(2)_L$ right-handed fermion singlets are\npaired up with new heavy fermions to form $SU(2)_H$ doublets, and $SU(2)_L$\nleft-handed fermion doublets are singlets under $SU(2)_H$. An $SU(2)_H$ scalar\ndoublet, which provides masses to the new heavy fermions as well as the\n$SU(2)_H$ gauge bosons, can be produced via gluon fusion and subsequently\ndecays into two photons with the new fermions circulating the triangle loops to\naccount for the deviation from the standard model prediction.\n", "  In this paper we consider a minimal extension to the standard model by a\nscalar triplet field with hypercharge $Y=2$. This model relies on the seesaw\nmechanism which provides a consistent explication of neutrino mass generation.\nWe show from naturalness considerations that the Veltman condition is modified\nby virtue of the additional scalar charged states and that quadratic\ndivergencies at one loop can be driven to zero within the allowed space\nparameter of the model, the latter is severely constrained by unitarity,\nboundedness from below and is consistent with the di-photon Higgs decay data of\nLHC. Furthermore, we analyse the naturalness condition effects to the masses of\nheavy Higgs bosons $H^0$, $A^0$, $H^\\pm$ and $H^{\\pm\\pm}$, providing a drastic\nreduction of the ranges of variation of $m_{H^{\\pm}}$ and $m_{H^{\\pm\\pm}}$ with\nan upper bounds at $288$ and $351$~GeV respectively, while predicting an almost\ndegeneracy for the other neutral Higgs bosons $H^0$, $A^0$ at about $207$~GeV.\n", "  Delay differential equations (DDE) can have \"chaotic\" solutions that can be\nused to mimic Brownian motion. Since a Brownian motion is random in its\nvelocity, it is reasonable to think that a random number generator (RNG) might\nbe constructed from such a model. In this preliminary study, we consider one\nspecific example of this and show that it satisfies criteria commonly employed\nin the testing of random number generators (from TestU01's very stringent \"Big\nCrush\" battery of tests). A technique termed digit discarding, commonly used in\nboth this generator and physical RNG's using laser feedback systems, is\ndiscussed with regard to the maximal Lyapunov exponent. Also, we benchmark the\ngenerator to a contemporary common method: the multiple recursive generator,\nMRG32k3a. Although our method is about 7 times slower than MRG32k3a, there is\nin principle no apparent limit on the number of possible values that can be\ngenerated from the scheme we present here.\n", "  Both simulated quantum annealing and physical quantum annealing have shown\nthe emergence of \"heavy tails\" in their performance as optimizers: The total\ntime needed to solve a set of random input instances is dominated by a small\nnumber of very hard instances. Classical simulated annealing, in contrast, does\nnot show such heavy tails. Here we explore the origin of these heavy tails,\nwhich appear for inputs with high local degeneracy---large isoenergetic\nclusters of states in Hamming space. This category includes the low-precision\nChimera-structured problems studied in recent benchmarking work comparing the\nD-Wave Two quantum annealing processor with simulated annealing. On similar\ninputs designed to suppress local degeneracy, performance of a quantum\nannealing processor on hard instances improves by orders of magnitude at the\n512-qubit scale, while classical performance remains relatively unchanged.\nSimulations indicate that perturbative crossings are the primary factor\ncontributing to these heavy tails, while sensitivity to Hamiltonian\nmisspecification error plays a less significant role in this particular\nsetting.\n", "  The Universe on scales $10-100~h^{-1}$ Mpc is dominated by a cosmic web of\nvoids, filaments, sheets and knots of galaxy clusters. These structures\nparticipate differently in the global expansion of the Universe: from\nnon-expanding clusters to the above average expansion rate of voids. In this\npaper we characterize Hubble expansion anisotropies in the COMPOSITE sample of\n4534 galaxies and clusters. We concentrate on the dipole and quadrupole in the\nrest frame of the Local Group. These both have statistically significant\namplitudes. These anisotropies, and their redshift dependence, cannot be\nexplained solely by a boost of the Local Group in the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model which expands isotropically\nin the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. We\nsimulate the local expansion of the Universe with inhomogeneous Szekeres\nmodels, which match the standard FLRW model on $> 100~h^{-1}$ Mpc scales but\nexhibit nonkinematic relativistic differential expansion on small scales. We\nrestrict models to be consistent with observed CMB temperature anisotropies,\nwhile simultaneously fitting the redshift variation of the Hubble expansion\ndipole. We include features to account for both the Local Void and the \"Great\nAttractor\". While this naturally accounts for the Hubble expansion and CMB\ndipoles, the simulated quadrupoles are smaller than observed. Further\nrefinement to incorporate additional structures may improve this. This would\nenable a test of the hypothesis that some large angle CMB anomalies result from\nfailing to treat the relativistic differential expansion of the background\ngeometry, a natural feature of solutions to Einstein's equations not included\nin the current standard model of cosmology.\n", "  We have studied the exotic superfluid phases of degenerated Fermi gases with\nspin-orbit coupling in a mixed dimensional system, where the motion of atoms\nare free in the x-direction and the tunneling between nearest tubes in the\ny-direction is permitted. Using the mean-field method, we obtain the phase\ndiagrams of the system during the dimensional crossover between quasi one\ndimension to quasi two dimension. We find the existence of the topological\nstate and Majorana edge mode in the weak tunneling case, and a rich phase\ndiagram including two kinds of nodal superfluid phase and gapped superfluid\nphase in the opposite case. Our results show that topological pairing is\nfavoured in quasi one dimension while nodal pairing state is favoured in quasi\ntwo dimension.\n", "  We consider a quantum particle on a one dimensional lattice subject to weak\nlocal measurements and study its stochastic dynamics conditioned on the\nmeasurement outcomes. Depending on the measurement strength our analysis of the\nquantum trajectories reveals dynamical regimes reach- ing from quasi-coherent\nwave packet oscillations to a Zeno-type dynamics. We analyse how these\ndynamical regimes are directly reflected in the spectral properties of the\nnoisy measurement records.\n", "  We study ballistic transport of Dirac electrons through a strip in silicene,\nwhen the strip is exposed to off-resonant circularly polarized light and an\nelectric field applied perpendicular to the silicene plane. We show that the\nconductance through the strip is spin- or/and valley-polarized. This can be\nexplained by spin-valley coupling in silicene, and modification of its band\nstructure through virtual absorption/emission processes and also by the\nperpendicular electric field. The spin- (valley-) polarization can be enhanced\nby tuning the light intensity and the value of the perpendicular electric\nfield, leading to perfect spin (valley) filtering for certain of their values.\nFurther, the spin (valley) polarization can be inverted by reversing the\nperpendicular electric field (by reversing the perpendicular electric field or\nreversing the circular polarization of the light irradiation). The conditions\nnecessary for the fully valley polarization is determined.\n", "  First principles calculations are used to study the preferential occupation\nof ternary alloying additions into the binary Ti-Al phases, namely\n$\\gamma$-TiAl, $\\alpha_2$-Ti$_3$Al, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{o}}$-TiAl, and B19-TiAl.\nWhile the early transition metals (TMs, group IVB, VB , and VIB elements)\nprefer to substitute for Ti atoms in the $\\gamma$-, $\\alpha_2$-, and\nB19-phases, they preferentially occupy Al sites in the\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{o}}$-TiAl. Si is in this context an anomaly, as it prefers to\nsit on the Al sublattice for all four phases. B and C are shown to prefer\noctahedral Ti-rich interstitial positions instead of substitutional\nincorporation. The site preference energy is linked with the alloying-induced\nchanges of energy of formation, hence alloying-related (de)stabilisation of the\nphases. We further show that the phase-stabilisation effect of early TMs on\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{o}}$-phase has a different origin depending on their valency.\nFinally, an extensive comparison of our predictions with available theoretical\nand experimental data (which is, however, limited mostly to the $\\gamma$-phase)\nshows a consistent picture.\n", "  In models with extended Higgs sector and additional matter fields, the decay\nmodes of heavy Higgs bosons can be dominated by cascade decays through the new\nfermions rendering present search strategies ineffective. We investigate new\ndecay topologies of heavy neutral Higgses in two Higgs doublet model with\nvectorlike leptons. We also discuss constraints from existing searches and\ndiscovery prospects. Among the most interesting signatures are monojet, mono Z,\nmono Higgs, and Z and Higgs bosons produced with a pair of charged leptons.\n", "  One of the most exciting explanations advanced for the recent diphoton excess\nfound by ATLAS and CMS is in terms of sgoldstino decays: a signal of low-energy\nsupersymmetry-breaking scenarios. The sgoldstino, a scalar, couples directly to\ngluons and photons, with strength related to gaugino masses, that can be of the\nright magnitude to explain the excess. However, fitting the suggested resonance\nwidth, Gamma ~ 45 GeV, is not so easy. In this paper we explore efficient\npossibilities to enhance the sgoldstino width, via the decay into two Higgses,\ntwo Higgsinos and through mixing between the sgoldstino and the Higgs boson. In\naddition, we present an alternative and more efficient mechanism to generate a\nmass splitting between the scalar and pseudoscalar components of the\nsgoldstino, which has been suggested as an interesting alternative explanation\nto the apparent width of the resonance.\n", "  A systematic investigation of the nuclear observables related to the triaxial\ndegree of freedom is presented using the multi-quasiparticle triaxial projected\nshell model (TPSM) approach. These properties correspond to the observation of\n$\\gamma$-bands, chiral doublet bands and the wobbling mode. In the TPSM\napproach, $\\gamma$-bands are built on each quasiparticle configuration and it\nis demonstrated that some observations in high-spin spectroscopy that have\nremained unresolved for quite some time could be explained by considering\n$\\gamma$-bands based on two-quasiparticle configurations. It is shown in some\nCe-, Nd- and Ge-isotopes that the two observed aligned or s-bands originate\nfrom the same intrinsic configuration with one of them as the $\\gamma$-band\nbased on a two-quasiparticle configuration. In the present work, we have also\nperformed a detailed study of $\\gamma$-bands observed up to the highest spin in\nDysposium, Hafnium, Mercury and Uranium isotopes. Furthermore, several\nmeasurements related to chiral symmetry breaking and wobbling motion have been\nreported recently. These phenomena, which are possible only for triaxial\nnuclei, have been investigated using the TPSM approach. It is shown that\ndoublet bands observed in lighter odd-odd Cs-isotopes can be considered as\ncandidates for chiral symmetry breaking. Transverse wobbling motion recently\nobserved in $^{135}$Pr has also been investigated and it is shown that TPSM\napproach provides a reasonable description of the measured properties.\n", "  This work provides an overview of our recent results in studying two most\nimportant and widely discussed quantum processes: electron-positron pairs\nproduction off a probe photon propagating through a polarized short-pulsed\nelectromagnetic (e.g.\\ laser) wave field or generalized Breit-Wheeler process,\nand a single a photon emission off an electron interacting with the laser\npules, so-called non-linear Compton scattering. We show that the probabilities\nof particle production in both processes are determined by interplay of two\ndynamical effects, where the first one is related to the shape and duration of\nthe pulse and the second one is non-linear dynamics of the interaction of\ncharged fermions with a strong electromagnetic field. We elaborate suitable\nexpressions for the production probabilities and cross sections, convenient for\nstudying evolution of the plasma in presence of strong electromagnetic fields\n", "  We generate single-photon catalyzed coherent states (SPCCSs) by means of\nquantum-optical catalysis based on the beam splitter (BS) or the parametric\namplifier (PA). These states are obtained in one of the BS (or PA) output\nchannels if a coherent state and a single-photon Fock state are present in two\ninput ports and a single photon is registered in the other output port. The\nsuccess probabilities of the detection (also the normalization factors) are\ndiscussed, which is different for BS and PA catalysis. In addition, we prove\nthat the generated states catalyzed by BS and PA devices are actually the same\nquantum states after analyzing photon number distribution of the SPCCSs. The\nquantum properties of the SPCCSs, such as sub-Poissionian distribution,\nanti-bunching effect, quadrature squeezing effect, and the negativity of the\nWigner function are investigated in detail. The results shows that the SPCCSs\nare non-Gaussian states with an abundance of nonclassicality, which can provide\nthe quantum advantages for quantum technological tasks.\n", "  Collective excitation modes are a characteristic feature of symmetry-broken\nphases of matter. For example, superconductors exhibit an amplitude Higgs mode\nand a phase mode, which are the radial and angular excitations in the\nMexican-hat potential of the free energy. In two-band superconductors there\nexists in addition a Leggett phase mode, which corresponds to collective\nfluctuations of the interband phase difference. In equilibrium systems\namplitude and phase modes are decoupled, since they are mutually orthogonal\nexcitations. The direct detection of Higgs and Leggett modes by linear-response\nmeasurements is challenging, because they are often overdamped and do not\ncouple directly to the electromagnetic field. In this work, using numerical\nexact simulations we show for the case of two-gap superconductors, that optical\npump-probe experiments excite both Higgs and Leggett modes out of equilibrium.\nWe find that this non-adiabatic excitation process introduces a strong\ninteraction between the collective modes. Moreover, we predict that the coupled\nHiggs and Leggett modes are clearly visible in the pump-probe absorption\nspectra as oscillations at their respective frequencies.\n", "  Interferometry with trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) requires\nthe development of techniques to recombine the two paths of the interferometer\nand map the accumulated phase difference to a measurable atom number\ndifference. We have implemented and compared two recombining procedures in a\ndouble-well based BEC interferometer. The first procedure utilizes the bosonic\nJosephson effect and controlled tunneling of atoms through the potential\nbarrier, similar to laser light in an optical fibre coupler. The second one\nrelies on the interference of the reflected and transmitted parts of the BEC\nwavefunction when impinging on the potential barrier, analogous to light\nimpinging on a half-silvered mirror. Both schemes were implemented\nsuccessfully, yielding an interferometric contrast of about 20% and 42%\nrespectively. Building efficient matter wave recombiners represents an\nimportant step towards the coherent manipulation of external quantum\nsuperposition states of BECs.\n", "  Gradient sensing underlies important biological processes including\nmorphogenesis, polarization, and cell migration. The precision of gradient\nsensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in\nthe gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of\nconcentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests\nthat precision should also increase with detector length in the direction\ntransverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the\nnoise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the\nprecision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest\ngradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason\nis that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured\nconcentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these\nmeasurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between\nthe measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We\ndemonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional\nexcitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the\nbenefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the\noptimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are\nconsistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell\npopulations.\n", "  Neutron stars are commonly considered as astronomical objects having\nhighdensity interiors and an inner core region in which various hadronic matter\nphases are expected. Several studies show that the inner structures affect\nmacroscopic phenomena of the star. However, we know that the inner structures\nof the star strongly depend on the equation of state (EOS). The EOS of\nhigh-density matter is still not clear and several recent observations indicate\nrestrictions to EOSs. Theoretical studies should elucidate EOSs at high density\nand/or high temperature. For instance, many theoretical studies have attempted\nto account for the rotation effect of rapidly rotating neutron stars (i.e.,\npulsars). Accordingly, we also apply our EOSs to rapidly rotating stars.\nFurthermore, neutron stars generate a strong magnetic field. Several recent\nstudies indicate that this magnetic field exerts restrictions on the EOS. In\nthis paper, we focus on the investigation of the inner structures and the\napplication of our EOSs to rotating stars. We find that one of our EOSs is\nconsistent with observations, and another is inconsistent. We also find an\nimportant relation between the radius and rotation.\n", "  Large acceptance spectrometers at in-flight RI separators have played\nsignificant roles in investigating the structure of exotic nuclei. Such\nspectrometers are in particular useful for probing unbound states of exotic\nnuclei, using invariant mass spectroscopy with reactions at intermediate and\nhigh energies. We discuss here the key characteristic features of such\nspectrometers, by introducing the recently commissioned SAMURAI facility at the\nRIBF, RIKEN. We also explore the issue of cross talk in the detection of\nmultiple neutrons, which has become crucial for exploring further unbound\nstates and nuclei beyond the neutron drip line. Finally we discuss future\nperspectives for large acceptance spectrometers at the new-generation RI-beam\nfacilities.\n", "  The quantum state of motion of a large and rotating polar molecule can lose\ncoherence through the collisions with gas atoms. We show how the associated\nquantum master equation for the center of mass can be expressed in terms of the\norientationally averaged differential and total scattering cross sections, for\nwhich we provide approximate analytic expressions. The master equation is then\nutilized to quantify collisional decoherence in a interference experiment with\npolar molecules.\n", "  A novel approach which uses Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors has been\nutilised to assess and monitor the flatness of Gaseous Electron Multipliers\n(GEM) foils. The setup layout and preliminary results are presented.\n", "  We discuss Levi-Civita connections on Courant algebroids. We define an\nappropriate generalization of the curvature tensor and compute the\ncorresponding scalar curvatures in the exact and heterotic case, leading to\ngeneralized (bosonic) Einstein-Hilbert type of actions known from supergravity.\nIn particular, we carefully analyze the process of the reduction for the\ngeneralized metric, connection, curvature tensor and the scalar curvature.\n", "  The effective energy of a superconductor $E_{eff}(T)$ at temperature $T$ is\ndefined as the difference between the total energy at temperature $T$ and the\ntotal energy at 0~K. We call the energy of the condensate, ${\\mathcal E}_c$,\nthe difference between $E_{eff}$ and the sum of the quasiparticle energies\n$E_{qp}$. ${\\mathcal E}_c$, $E_{qp}$, as well as the BCS quasiparticle energy\n$\\epsilon$ are positive and depend on the gap energy $\\Delta$, which, in turn,\ndepends on the populations of the quasiparticle states (equivalently, they\ndepend on $T$). So from the energy point of view the superconductor is a Fermi\nliquid of non-ideal quasiparticles.\n  We show that the choice of quasiparticles is not unique, but there is an\ninfinite range of possibilities. Some of these possibilities have been explored\nin the context of the fractional exclusion statistics (FES), which is a general\nmethod of describing interacting particle systems as ideal gases. We apply FES\nhere and transform the Fermi liquid of BCS excitations into an ideal gas by\nredefining the quasiparticle energies. The new FES quasiparticles exhibit the\nsame energy gap as the BCS quasiparticles, but a different DOS, which is finite\nat any quasiparticle energy.\n  We also discuss the effect of the remnant electron-electron interaction\n(electron-electron interaction beyond the BCS pairing model) and show that this\ncan stabilize the BCS condensate, increasing the critical temperature.\n", "  Day by day, people exchange opinions about a given new with relatives,\nfriends, and coworkers. In most cases, they get informed about a given issue by\nreading newspapers, listening to the radio, or watching TV, i.e., through a\nMass Media (MM). However, the importance of a given new can be stimulated by\nthe Media by assigning newspaper's pages or time in TV programs. In this sense,\nwe say that the Media has the power to \"set the agenda\", i.e., it decides which\nnew is important and which is not. On the other hand, the Media can know\npeople's concerns through, for instance, websites or blogs where they express\ntheir opinions, and then it can use this information in order to be more\nappealing to an increasing number of people. In this work, we study different\nscenarios in an agent-based model of cultural dissemination, in which a given\nMass Media has a specific purpose: To set a particular topic of discussion and\nimpose its point of view to as many social agents as it can. We model this by\nmaking the Media has a fixed feature, representing its point of view in the\ntopic of discussion, while it tries to attract new consumers, by taking\nadvantage of feedback mechanisms, represented by adaptive features. We explore\ndifferent strategies that the Media can adopt in order to increase the affinity\nwith potential consumers and then the probability to be successful in imposing\nthis particular topic.\n", "  The fundamental nature of Dark Matter (DM) has not been established. Indeed,\nbeyond its gravitational effects, DM remains undetected by present experiments.\nIn this situation, it is reasonable to wonder if other alternatives can\neffectively explain the observations usually associated with the existence of\nDM. The modification of the gravitational interaction has been studied in this\ncontext from many different approaches. However, the large amount of different\nastrophysical evidences makes difficult to think that modified gravity can\naccount for all these observations. On the other hand, if such a modification\nintroduces new degrees of freedom, they may work as DM candidates. We will\nsummarize the phenomenology of these gravitational dark matter candidates by\nanalyzing minimal models.\n", "  We present our model-independent and data-driven method to describe\npseudoscalar meson transition form factors in the space- and (low-energy)\ntime-like regions. The method is general and conforms a toolkit applicable to\nany other form factor, of one and two variables, with the potential to include\nboth high- and low-energy QCD constraints altogether. The method makes use of\nanalyticity and unitary properties of form factors, it is simple, systematic\nand can be improved upon by including new data. In the present discussion, the\nmethod is used to show the impact of experimental data for precision\ncalculations in the low-energy sector of the Standard Model. In particular, due\nto its relevance for New Physics searches, we have considered the hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon (the pseudoscalar exchange contribution), the pseudoscalar decays into\nlepton pairs, and the determination of the mixing parameters of the $\\eta$ and\n$\\eta'$ system. For all of them we provide the most updated results in a\ndata-driven manner.\n", "  We study the advantages of quantum strategies in evolutionary social dilemmas\non evolving random networks. We focus our study on the two-player games:\nprisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and stag-hunt games. The obtained result show the\nbenefits of quantum strategies for the prisoner's dilemma game. For the other\ntwo games, we obtain regions of parameters where the quantum strategies\ndominate, as well as regions where the classical strategies coexist.\n", "  We consider asymptotically-free four-dimensional large-$N$ gauge theories\nwith massive fermionic and bosonic adjoint matter fields, compactified on\nsquashed three-spheres, and examine their regularized large-$N$ confined-phase\nspectral sums. The analysis is done in the limit of vanishing 't Hooft\ncoupling, which is justified by taking the size of the compactification\nmanifold to be small compared to the inverse strong scale $\\Lambda^{-1}$. Our\nresults motivate us to conjecture some universal spectral sum rules for these\nlarge $N$ gauge theories.\n", "  Stereoscopic 3D (S3D) displays provide an additional sense of depth compared\nto non-stereoscopic displays by sending slightly different images to the two\neyes. But conventional S3D displays do not reproduce all natural depth cues. In\nparticular, focus cues are incorrect causing mismatches between accommodation\nand vergence: The eyes must accommodate to the display screen to create sharp\nretinal images even when binocular disparity drives the eyes to converge to\nother distances. This mismatch causes visual discomfort and reduces visual\nperformance. We propose and assess two new techniques that are designed to\nreduce the vergence-accommodation conflict and thereby decrease discomfort and\nincrease visual performance. These techniques are much simpler to implement\nthan previous conflict-reducing techniques.\n", "  By explicit calculations of four-field couplings, we observe that the higher\nderivative corrections to the DBI action in flat space-time, can be either in a\ncovariant form or in a T-duality invariant form. The two forms are related by a\nnon-covariant field redefinition. Using this observation, we then propose a\nnon-covariant but T-duality invariant action which includes all orders of\nmassless fields and has two extra derivatives with respect to the DBI action.\n", "  We introduce a method for finely adjusting the etch depth profile by dynamic\nshielding in the course of ion beam etching (IBE), which is crucial for the\nultra-precision fabrication of large optics. We study the physical process of\ndynamic shielding and propose a parametric modeling method to quantitatively\nanalyze the shielding effect on etch depths, or rather the shielding rate,\nwhere a piecewise Gaussian model is adopted to fit the shielding rate profile.\nWe have conducted two experiments. In the experiment on parametric modeling of\nshielding rate profiles, its result shows that the shielding rate profile is\nsignificantly influenced by the rotary angle of the leaf. And the experimental\nresult of fine-tuning the etch depth profile shows good agreement with the\nsimulated result, which preliminarily verifies the feasibility of our method.\n", "  We study a family of integrable systems of nonlinearly coupled harmonic\noscillators on the classical and quantum levels. We show that the integrability\nof these systems follows from their symmetry characterized by algebras called\nhere Kummer shape algebras. The resolution of identity for a wide class of\nreproducing kernels is found. A number of examples, illustrating this theory,\nis also presented.\n", "  Here, we present the comparative study of magnetotransport properties of\nrecently discovered Ta2PdTe6 and Nb2PdS5 superconductors. The XRD and\nmagnetotransport measurements are performed on these samples to investigate\nstructure and superconducting properties as well as normal state transport\nproperties of these compounds. Both the compounds are crystallized in\nmonoclinic structure within space group C2m. Here, we observe superconductivity\nin both the compounds Ta2PdTe6 (Tc =4.4 K) and Nb2PdS5 (Tc =6.6 K). We see a\nlinear magnetoresistance in Ta2PdTe6 as well as violation of Kohler rule in\nsame compound. On the other hand, we find the absence of same in Nb2PdS5\ncompound.\n", "  We investigate cold bosonic impurity atoms trapped in a vortex lattice formed\nby condensed bosons of another species. We describe the dynamics of the\nimpurities by a bosonic Hubbard model containing occupation-dependent\nparameters to capture the effects of strong impurity-impurity interactions.\nThese include both a repulsive direct interaction and an attractive effective\ninteraction mediated by the BEC. The occupation dependence of these two\ncompeting interactions drastically affects the Hubbard model phase diagram,\nincluding causing the disappearance of some Mott lobes\n", "  Research efforts ranging from studies of solid helium to searches for a\nneutron electric dipole moment require isotopically purified helium with a\nratio of 3He to 4He at levels below that which can be measured using\ntraditional mass spectroscopy techniques. We demonstrate an approach to such a\nmeasurement using accelerator mass spectroscopy, reaching the 10e-14 level of\nsensitivity, several orders of magnitude more sensitive than other techniques.\nMeasurements of 3He/4He in samples relevant to the measurement of the neutron\nlifetime indicate the need for substantial corrections. We also argue that\nthere is a clear path forward to sensitivity increases of at least another\norder of magnitude.\n", "  In this paper we obtain conserved charges of spin-3 topologically massive\ngravity by using a quasi-local formalism. We find a general formula to\ncalculate conserved charge of the spin-3 topologically massive gravity which\ncorresponds to a Killing vector field $\\xi$. We show that this general formula\nreduces to the previous one for the ordinary spin-3 gravity presented in\n\\cite{31} when we take into account only transformation under diffeomorphism,\nwithout considering generalized Lorentz gauge transformation (i.e. $\\lambda\n_{\\xi} =0$), and by taking $\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\rightarrow 0$. Then we obtain a\ngeneral formula for the entropy of black hole solutions of the spin-3\ntopologically massive gravity. Finally we apply our formalism to calculate\nenergy, angular momentum and entropy of a special black hole solution and we\nfind that obtained results are consistent with previous results in the limiting\ncases. Moreover our result for energy, angular momentum and entropy are\nconsistent with the first law of black hole mechanics.\n", "  The band structures and optical properties of AAB-stacked trilayer graphenes\n(AAB-TLG) are calculated by the tight-binding model and gradient approximation.\nThree pairs of the energy bands exhibit very different energy dispersions at\nlow energy and saddle points at the middle energy. At zero electric field,\n$3$$^2$ excitation channels exist in both the low and middle frequencies, and\ncause the very rich joint density of states (JDOS). However, the structures in\nthe JDOS do not appear in the absorption spectra completely. Due to the\ndifferent contributions from the velocity metric elements, some excitation\ntransitions disappear in the spectra. Furthermore, the frequency and the\nexistence of the absorption structures are affected by the increase of the\nelectric field from zero.\n", "  A layer of dielectric elastomer can be voltage actuated to behave as\nactuators, but needs to avoid the electromechanical instability of excessively\nthin down accompanied with electric breakdown. We develop a true method to\nanalyze the electromechanical stability of dielectric elastomers by adopting\nthe positive definiteness of the true tangential modulus matrix, and\ndemonstrate that the previous method is only valid for the special case of zero\nprestress. Our new method is applicable for arbitrary prestress cases including\nzero prestress, with predictions consistent with available experimental\nmeasurements. Our theoretical results demonstrate the significant effects of\nprestress on critical voltage and critical actuation stretches.\n", "  In a thermal ensemble of atoms driven by coherent fields, how does evolution\nof quantum superposition compete with classical dynamics of optical pumping and\natomic diffusion? Is it optical pumping that first prepares a thermal ensemble,\nwith coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way\nround: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping?\nUsing a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these\nquestions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed\nthree-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong\ncoherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe\ntransmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a\nscenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is\ndictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of\nhalf-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that,\nin fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly\nlonger time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control\nturn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature\nfor identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model\npredictions confirm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich\nand complex dynamics associated with atoms in thermal ensemble, which are\notherwise absent in state-prepared, cold atomic ensembles.\n", "  Within a cluster, gravitational effects can lead to the removal of stars from\ntheir parent galaxies. Gas hydrodynamical effects can additionally strip gas\nand dust from galaxies. The properties of the ICL can therefore help constrain\nthe physical processes at work in clusters by serving as a fossil record of the\ninteraction history. The present study is designed to characterise this ICL in\na ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopic\npoints of view. By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAM\nimages, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. These sources were\nthen spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. MUSE data were also used to\ncompute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures.\nAn atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. Part of\nthe detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component and\napparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sources\nare clearly dominated by old stars. Furthermore, emission lines were detected\nin several places of diffuse light. Our spectral analysis shows that this\nemission likely originates from low-excitation parameter gas. The stellar\ncontribution to the ICL is about 2.3x10^9 yrs old even though the ICL is not\ncurrently forming a large number of stars. On the other hand, the contribution\nof the gas emission to the ICL in the optical is much greater than the stellar\ncontribution in some regions, but the gas density is likely too low to form\nstars. These observations favour ram pressure stripping, turbulent viscous\nstripping, or supernovae winds as the origin of the large amount of\nintracluster light. Since the cluster appears not to be in a major merging\nphase, we conclude that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible process\nthat generates the observed ICL sources.\n", "  A relevant result independently obtained by Rayleigh and Sneddon on an\nidentity on series involving the zeros of Bessel functions of the first kind is\nderived by an alternative method based on Laplace transforms. Our method leads\nto a Bernstein function of time, expressed by Dirichlet series, that allows us\nto recover the Rayleigh-Sneddon sum. We also consider another method arriving\nat the same result based on a relevant formula by Calogero. Moreover, we also\nprovide an electrical example in which this sum results to be extremely useful\nin order to recover the analytical expression for the response of the system to\na certain external input.\n", "  We present a theoretical formalism for resonance fluorescence radiating from\na two-level system (TLS) driven by any periodic driving and coupled to multiple\nreservoirs. The formalism is derived analytically based on the combination of\nFloquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to\ncalculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are\nanalytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We\ncan systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present\nformalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to\ncomprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is\nsimultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We\ndemonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the\ndriving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be\nattributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in\nterms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and\ntheir steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of\nthe fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields\nin contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the\nbiharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from\nthe result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple\nresonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that\nthe present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the\nfluorescence spectrum of periodically strongly driven TLSs.\n", "  We show that the critical fields of the magnetization plateaus of the\nShastry-Sutherland model decrease significantly upon increasing the ratio of\ninter- to intra-dimer coupling, and accordingly that the magnetization plateaus\nof SrCu_2(BO_3)_2 shift to lower field under pressure, making the first two\nplateaus at 1/8 and 2/15 potentially accessible to neutron scattering\nexperiments. These conclusions are based on the derivation of an effective\nclassical model of interacting pinwheel-shaped spin-2 bound states using a\ncombination of perturbative and graph-based continuous unitary transformations,\nshowing that pinwheel crystals are indeed the lowest-energy plateau structures\nat low magnetization, and that a simple model of intermediate-range two-body\nrepulsion between pinwheels is able to account quantitatively for the plateau\nsequence.\n", "  We present a general expression for the values of the average kinetic energy\nand of the temperature of kinetic decoupling of a WIMP, valid for any\ncosmological model. We show an example of the usage of our solution when the\nHubble rate has a power-law dependence on temperature.\n", "  We investigate leave-one-out cross validation (CV) as a determinator of the\nweight of the penalty term in the least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator (LASSO). First, on the basis of the message passing algorithm and a\nperturbative discussion assuming that the number of observations is\nsufficiently large, we provide simple formulas for approximately assessing two\ntypes of CV errors, which enable us to significantly reduce the necessary cost\nof computation. These formulas also provide a simple connection of the CV\nerrors to the residual sums of squares between the reconstructed and the given\nmeasurements. Second, on the basis of this finding, we analytically evaluate\nthe CV errors when the design matrix is given as a simple random matrix in the\nlarge size limit by using the replica method. Finally, these results are\ncompared with those of numerical simulations on finite-size systems and are\nconfirmed to be correct. We also apply the simple formulas of the first type of\nCV error to an actual dataset of the supernovae.\n", "  The paper deals with the global Kondaurov double porosity model describing a\nnon-equilibrium two-phase immiscible flow in fractured-porous reservoirs when\nnon-equilibrium phenomena occur in the matrix blocks, only. It is shown that\nthe homogenized model can be represented as usual equations of two-phase\nincompressible immiscible flow, except for the addition of two source terms\ncalculated by a solution to a local problem which is a boundary value problem\nfor a non-equilibrium imbibition equation given in terms of the real saturation\nand a non-equilibrium parameter.\n", "  Electronic behavior of a 1D Aubry chain with Hubbard interaction is\ncritically analyzed in presence of electric field. Multiple energy bands are\ngenerated as a result of Hubbard correlation and Aubry potential, and, within\nthese bands localized states are developed under the application of electric\nfield. Within a tight-binding framework we compute electronic transmission\nprobability and average density of states using Green's function approach where\nthe interaction parameter is treated under Hartree-Fock mean field scheme. From\nour analysis we find that selective transmission can be obtained by tuning\ninjecting electron energy, and thus, the present model can be utilized as a\ncontrolled switching device.\n", "  In testing gravity a model-independent way, one of crucial tests is measuring\nthe propagation speed of a gravitational wave (GW). In general relativity, a GW\npropagates with the speed of light, while in the alternative theories of\ngravity the propagation speed could deviate from the speed of light due to the\nmodification of gravity or spacetime structure at a quantum level. Previously\nwe proposed the method measuring the GW speed by directly comparing the arrival\ntimes between a GW and a photon from the binary merger of neutron stars or\nneutron star and black hole, assuming that it is associated with a short\ngamma-ray burst. The sensitivity is limited by the intrinsic time delay between\na GW and a photon at the source. In this paper, we extend the method to\ndistinguish the intrinsic time delay from the true signal caused by anomalous\nGW speed with multiple events at cosmological distances, also considering the\nredshift distribution of GW sources, redshift-dependent GW propagation speed,\nand the statistics of intrinsic time delays. We show that an advanced GW\ndetector such as Einstein Telescope will constrain the GW propagation speed at\nthe precision of ~10^{-16}. We also discuss the optimal statistic to measure\nthe GW speed, performing numerical simulations.\n", "  One of the remaining challenges within the standard model is to gain a good\nunderstanding of QCD in the non-perturbative regime. One key step toward this\naim is baryon spectroscopy, investigating the spectrum and the properties of\nbaryon resonances. To get access to resonances with small $\\pi N$ partial\nwidth, photoproduction experiments provide essential information. In order to\nextract the contributing resonances, partial wave analyses need to be\nperformed. Here, a complete experiment is required to unambiguously determine\nthe contributing amplitudes. This involves the measurement of carefully chosen\nsingle and double polarization observables. The CBELSA/TAPS experiment with a\nlongitudinally or transversely polarized target and an energy tagged, linearly\nor circularly polarized photon beam allows the measurement of a large set of\npolarization observables. Due to its good energy resolution, high detection\nefficiency for photons, and the nearly complete solid angle coverage it is\nideally suited for the measurement of photoproduction of neutral mesons\ndecaying into photons. Recent results for various double polarization\nobservables in $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ photoproduction and their impact on the\npartial wave analysis are discussed.\n", "  It is shown that the spin polarized condensate appears in quark matter at\nhigh baryon density and low temperature due to the tensor-type four-point\ninteraction in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type model as a low energy effective\ntheory of quantum chromodynamics. It is indicated within this low energy\neffective model that the chiral symmetry is broken again by the spin polarized\ncondensate as increasing the quark number density, while the chiral symmetry\nrestoration occurs in which the chiral condensate disappears at a certain\ndensity.\n", "  Dark Matter experiments are recently focusing their detection techniques in\nlow-mass WIMPs, which requires the use of light elements and low energy\nthreshold. In this context, we describe the TREX-DM experiment, a low\nbackground Micromegas-based TPC for low-mass WIMP detection. Its main goal is\nthe operation of an active detection mass $\\sim$0.3 kg, with an energy\nthreshold below 0.4 keVee and fully built with previously selected radiopure\nmaterials. This work describes the commissioning of the actual setup situated\nin a laboratory on surface and the updates needed for a possible physics run at\nthe Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in 2016. A preliminary background\nmodel of TREX-DM is also presented, based on a Geant4 simulation, the\nsimulation of the detector's response and two discrimination methods: a\nconservative muon/electron and one based on a neutron source. Based on this\nbackground model, TREX-DM could be competitive in the search for low-mass\nWIMPs. In particular it could be sensitive, e.g., to the low-mass WIMP\ninterpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA and other hints in a conservative scenario.\n", "  Low-density amorphous ice (LDA) is involved in critical cosmological\nprocesses and has gained prominence as one of the at least two distinct\namorphous forms of ice. Despite these accolades, we still have an incomplete\nunderstanding of the structural diversity that is encompassed within the LDA\nstate and the dynamic processes that take place upon heating LDA. Heating the\nhigh-pressure ice VIII phase at ambient pressure is a remarkable example of\ntemperature-induced amorphisation yielding LDA. We investigate this process in\ndetail using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and show that the LDA\nobtained from ice VIII is structurally different from the more 'traditional'\nstates of LDA which are approached upon thermal annealing. This new structural\nrelaxation pathway involves an increase of structural order on the intermediate\nrange length scale. In contrast with other LDA materials the local structure is\nmore ordered initially and becomes slightly more disordered upon annealing. We\nalso show that the cascade of phase transitions upon heating ice VIII at\nambient pressure includes the formation of ice IX which may be connected with\nthe structural peculiarities of LDA from ice VIII. Overall, this study shows\nthat LDA is a structurally more diverse material than previously appreciated.\n", "  The correlations between the modulus of the Polyakov loop, its phase $\\theta$\nand the Landau gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature are investigated in\nconnection with the center symmetry for pure Yang-Mills SU(3) theory. In the\ndeconfined phase, where the center symmetry is spontaneously broken, the phase\nof the Polyakov loop per configuration is close to $\\theta = 0$, $\\pm \\, 2 \\pi\n/3$. We find that the gluon propagator form factors associated with $\\theta\n\\approx 0$ differs quantitatively and qualitatively from those associated to\n$\\theta \\approx \\pm \\, 2 \\pi /3$. This difference between the form factors is a\nproperty of the deconfined phase and a sign of the spontaneous breaking of the\ncenter symmetry. Furthermore, given that this difference vanishes in the\nconfined phase, it can be used as an order parameter associated to the\ndeconfinement transition. For simulations near the critical temperature $T_c$,\nthe difference between the propagators associated to $\\theta \\approx 0$ and\n$\\theta \\approx \\pm \\, 2 \\pi /3$ allows to classify the configurations as\nbelonging to the confined or deconfined phase. This establishes a selection\nprocedure which has a measurable impact in the gluon form factors. Our results\nalso show that the absence of the selection procedure can be erroneously taken\nas lattice artifacts.\n", "  We provide the power spectrum of small scalar perturbations propagating in an\ninflationary scenario within loop quantum cosmology. We consider the hybrid\nquantization approach applied to a Friedmann--Robertson--Walker spacetime with\nflat spatial sections coupled to a massive scalar field. We study the quantum\ndynamics of scalar perturbations on an effective background within this hybrid\napproach. We consider in our study adiabatic states of different orders. For\nthem, we find that the hybrid quantization is in good agreement with the\npredictions of the dressed metric approach. We also propose an initial vacuum\nstate for the perturbations, and compute the primordial and the anisotropy\npower spectrum in order to qualitatively compare with the current observations\nof Planck mission. We find that our vacuum state is in good agreement with\nthem, showing a suppression of the power spectrum for large scale anisotropies.\nWe compare with other choices already studied in the literature.\n", "  We have commenced experiments with intense short pulses of ion beams on the\nNeutralized Drift Compression Experiment (NDCX-II) at Lawrence Berkeley\nNational Laboratory, with 1-mm beam spot size within 2.5 ns full-width at half\nmaximum. The ion kinetic energy is 1.2 MeV. To enable the short pulse duration\nand mm-scale focal spot radius, the beam is neutralized in a 1.5-meter-long\ndrift compression section following the last accelerator cell. A\nshort-focal-length solenoid focuses the beam in the presence of the volumetric\nplasma that is near the target. In the accelerator, the line-charge density\nincreases due to the velocity ramp imparted on the beam bunch. The scientific\ntopics to be explored are warm dense matter, the dynamics of radiation damage\nin materials, and intense beam and beam-plasma physics including select topics\nof relevance to the development of heavy-ion drivers for inertial fusion\nenergy. Below the transition to melting, the short beam pulses offer an\nopportunity to study the multi-scale dynamics of radiation-induced damage in\nmaterials with pump-probe experiments, and to stabilize novel metastable phases\nof materials when short-pulse heating is followed by rapid quenching. First\nexperiments used a lithium ion source; a new plasma-based helium ion source\nshows much greater charge delivered to the target.\n", "  Two cold, gas giant planets orbiting a G-type main sequence star in the\ngalactic disk have previously been discovered in the high magnification\nmicrolensing event OGLE-2012-BLG-0026 (Han et al. 2013). Here we present\nrevised host star flux measurements and a refined model for the two-planet\nsystem using additional light curve data. We performed high angular resolution\nadaptive optics imaging with the Keck and Subaru telescopes at two epochs while\nthe source star was still amplified. We detected the lens flux, $H=16.39 \\pm\n0.08$. The lens, a disk star, is brighter than predicted from the modeling in\nthe original study. We revisited the light curve modeling using additional\nphotometric data from the B\\&C telescope in New Zealand and CTIO 1.3m H band\nlight curve. We then include the Keck and Subaru adaptive optic observation\nconstraints. The system is composed of a $\\sim 4-9$ Gyr lens star of $\\rm\nM_{lens} = 1.06 \\pm 0.05~\\,M_\\odot$ at a distance of $\\rm D_{lens} = 4.0 \\pm\n0.3~$kpc, orbited by two giant planets of $\\rm 0.145 \\pm 0.008\\ M_{\\rm Jup}$\nand $0.86 \\pm 0.06~\\rm M_{\\rm Jup}$ with projected separations of $4.0 \\pm 0.5\n$ AU and $4.8 \\pm 0.7$ AU respectively. Since the lens is brighter than the\nsource star by $16 \\pm 8 \\%$ in H, with no other blend within one arcsec, it\nwill be possible to estimate its metallicity by subsequent IR spectroscopy with\n8--10~m class telescopes. By adding a constraint on the metallicity it will be\npossible to refine the age of the system.\n", "  The nineteen-vertex model on a periodic lattice with an anti-diagonal twist\nis investigated. Its inhomogeneous transfer matrix is shown to have a simple\neigenvalue, with the corresponding eigenstate displaying intriguing\ncombinatorial features. Similar results were previously found for the same\nmodel with a diagonal twist. The eigenstate for the anti-diagonal twist is\nexplicitly constructed using the quantum separation of variables technique. A\nnumber of sum rules and special components are computed and expressed in terms\nof Kuperberg's determinants for partition functions of the inhomogeneous\nsix-vertex model. The computations of some components of the special eigenstate\nfor the diagonal twist are also presented. In the homogeneous limit, the\nspecial eigenstates become eigenvectors of the Hamiltonians of the integrable\nspin-one XXZ chain with twisted boundary conditions. Their sum rules and\nspecial components for both twists are expressed in terms of generating\nfunctions arising in the weighted enumeration of various symmetry classes of\nalternating sign matrices (ASMs). These include half-turn symmetric ASMs,\nquarter-turn symmetric ASMs, vertically symmetric ASMs, vertically and\nhorizontally perverse ASMs and double U-turn ASMs. As side results, new\ndeterminant and pfaffian formulas for the weighted enumeration of various\nsymmetry classes of alternating sign matrices are obtained.\n", "  We investigated the use of Hamamatsu fine-mesh photomultiplier tube\nassemblies H6152-70 and H6614-70 with regards to their gain and timing\nresolution in magnetic fields up to 1.9 T. Our results show that the H6614-70\nassembly can operate reliably in magnetic fields exceeding 1.5 T, while\npreserving a reasonable timing resolution even with a gain reduction of a\nfactor of approximately 100. The reduction of the relative gain of the H6152-70\nis similar to the H6614-70's near 1.5 T, but its timing resolution worsens\nconsiderably at this high field.\n", "  We consider the Universe at the late stage of its evolution and deep inside\nthe cell of uniformity. At such scales, the Universe is highly inhomogeneous\nand is filled with inhomogeneities in the form of galaxies and the groups of\ngalaxies. We also suggest that the Universe is filled with a perfect fluid, and\nits fluctuations have peculiar velocities of the same (non-relativistic) order\nof magnitude as for the inhomogeneities. In this sense, the inhomogeneities\n(e.g. galaxies) and fluctuations of perfect fluids are coupled with each other.\nWe clarify some important points of this approach and present a brief review of\nprevious studies (e.g. CPL model and Chaplygin gas). We demonstrate that\nconsidered perfect fluids which satisfy our approach are really coupled to\ngalaxies concentrating around them. The averaged (over the whole Universe)\nvalue of their fluctuations is equal to zero.\n", "  We study the series expansion of the tau function of the BKP hierarchy\napplying the addition formulae of the BKP hierarchy. Any formal power series\ncan be expanded in terms of Schur functions. It is known that, under the\ncondition $\\tau(x)\\neq0$, a formal power series $\\tau(x)$ is a solution of the\nKP hierarchy if and only if its coefficients of Schur function expansion are\ngiven by the so called Giambelli type formula. A similar result is known for\nthe BKP hierarchy with respect to Schur's Q-function expansion under a similar\ncondition. In this paper we generalize this result to the case of $\\tau(0)=0$.\n", "  The concept of symbolic sequences play important role in study of complex\nsystems. In the work we are interested in ultrametric structure of the set of\ncyclic sequences naturally arising in theory of dynamical systems. Aimed at\nconstruction of analytic and numerical methods for investigation of clusters we\nintroduce operator language on the space of symbolic sequences and propose an\napproach based on wavelet analysis for study of the cluster hierarchy. The\nanalytic power of the approach is demonstrated by derivation of a formula for\ncounting of {\\it two-fold de Bruijn sequences}, the extension of the notion of\nde Bruijn sequences. Possible advantages of the developed description is also\ndiscussed in context of applied p\n", "  Amorphous solids tend to present an abundance of soft elastic modes, which\ndiminish their transport properties, generate heterogeneities in their elastic\nresponse, and affect non-linear processes like thermal activation of\nplasticity. This is especially true in packings of particles near their jamming\ntransition, for which effective medium theory and variational arguments can\nboth predict the density of vibrational modes. However, recent numerics support\nthat one hypothesis of the variational argument does not hold. We provide a\nnovel variational argument which overcomes this problem, and correctly predicts\nthe scaling properties of soft modes near the jamming transition. Soft modes\nare shown to be related to the response to a local strain in more connected\nnetworks, and to be characterized by a volume $1/\\delta z$, where $\\delta z$ is\nthe excess coordination above the Maxwell threshold. These predictions are\nverified numerically.\n", "  The sensitivity of the atmospheric neutrino experiments to the non-standard\nflavor-dependent interaction in neutrino propagation is studied under the\nassumption that the only nonvanishing components of the non-standard matter\neffect are the electron and tau neutrino components $\\epsilon_{ee}$,\n$\\epsilon_{e\\tau}$, $\\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau}$ and that the tau-tau component\nsatisfies the constraint\n$\\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau}=|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|^2/(1+\\epsilon_{ee})$ which is suggested\nfrom the high energy behavior for atmospheric neutrino data.\n", "  We present fully general-relativistic simulations of binary neutron star\nmergers with a temperature and composition dependent nuclear equation of state.\nWe study the dynamical mass ejection from both quasi-circular and\ndynamical-capture eccentric mergers. We systematically vary the level of our\ntreatment of the microphysics to isolate the effects of neutrino cooling and\nheating and we compute the nucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta. We find that\neccentric binaries can eject significantly more material than quasi-circular\nbinaries and generate bright infrared and radio emission. In all our\nsimulations the outflow is composed of a combination of tidally- and\nshock-driven ejecta, mostly distributed over a broad $\\sim 60^\\circ$ angle from\nthe orbital plane, and, to a lesser extent, by thermally driven winds at high\nlatitudes. Ejecta from eccentric mergers are typically more neutron rich than\nthose of quasi-circular mergers. We find neutrino cooling and heating to\naffect, quantitatively and qualitatively, composition, morphology, and total\nmass of the outflows. This is also reflected in the infrared and radio\nsignatures of the binary. The final nucleosynthetic yields of the ejecta are\nrobust and insensitive to input physics or merger type in the regions of the\nsecond and third r-process peaks. The yields for elements on the first peak\nvary between our simulations, but none of our models is able to explain the\nSolar abundances of first-peak elements without invoking additional first-peak\ncontributions from either neutrino and viscously-driven winds operating on\nlonger timescales after the mergers, or from core-collapse supernovae.\n", "  We consider a dark sector with $SU(3)_C \\times U(1)_Y \\times U(1)_X$ and\nthree families of dark fermions that are chiral under dark $U(1)_X$ gauge\nsymmetry, whereas scalar dark matter $X$ is the SM singlet. $U(1)_X$ dark\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken by nonzero VEV of dark Higgs field $\\langle\n\\Phi \\rangle$, generating the masses of dark fermions and dark photon\n$Z^\\prime$. The resulting dark Higgs boson $\\phi$ can be produced at the LHC by\ndark quark loop (involving 3 generation) and will decay into a pair of photon\nthrough charged dark fermion loop. Its decay width can be easily $\\sim 45$ GeV\ndue to its possible decays into a pair of dark photon, which is not strongly\nconstrained by the current LHC searches $pp \\rightarrow \\phi \\rightarrow\nZ^\\prime Z^\\prime$ followed by $Z^\\prime$ decays into the SM fermion pairs. The\nscalar DM can achieve thermal relic density without conflict with direct\ndetection bound or the invisible $\\phi$ decay into a pair of DM.\n", "  Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) adapts an atomic force microscope to\nmeasure electric potential on surfaces at nanometer length scales. Here we\ndemonstrate that Heterodyne-KPFM enables scan rates of several frames per\nminute in air, and concurrently maintains spatial resolution and voltage\nsensitivity comparable to frequency-modulation KPFM, the current spatial\nresolution standard. Two common classes of topography-coupled artifacts are\nshown to be avoidable with H-KPFM. A second implementation of H-KPFM is also\nintroduced, in which the voltage signal is amplified by the first cantilever\nresonance for enhanced sensitivity. The enhanced temporal resolution of H-KPFM\ncan enable the imaging of many dynamic processes, such as such as\nelectrochromic switching, phase transitions, and device degredation (battery,\nsolar, etc.), which take place over seconds to minutes and involve changes in\nelectric potential at nanometer lengths.\n", "  Understanding the fundamental processes of light-matter interaction is\nimportant for detection of explosives and other energetic materials, which are\nactive in the infrared and terahertz (THz) region. We report a comprehensive\nstudy on electronic and vibrational lattice properties of structurally similar\n1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3- DNB) crystals through first-principles electronic\nstructure calculations and THz spectroscopy measurements on polycrystalline\nsamples. Starting from reported x-ray crystal structures, we use\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) with periodic boundary conditions to optimize\nthe structures and perform linear response calculations of the vibrational\nproperties at zero phonon momentum. The theoretically identified normal modes\nagree qualitatively with those obtained experimentally in a frequency range up\nto 2.5 THz and quantitatively at much higher frequencies. The latter\nfrequencies are set by intra-molecular forces. Our results suggest that van der\nWaals dispersion forces need to be included to improve the agreement between\ntheory and experiment in the THz region, which is dominated by intermolecular\nmodes and sensitive to details in the DFT calculation. An improved comparison\nis needed to assess and distinguish between intra- and intermolecular\nvibrational modes characteristic of energetic materials.\n", "  We present a systematical study on the roles of electron correlation and\nspin-orbit coupling in the isovalent Pd-doped superconductor SrPt$_3$P. By\nusing solid state reaction method, we fabricated the strong spin-orbit coupling\nsuperconductors Sr(Pt$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$)$_3$P with strong electron correlated Pd\ndopant of the $4d$ orbital. As increasing the isovalent Pd concentrations\nwithout introducing any extra electron/hole carriers, the superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_c$ decreases monotonously, which suggests the\nexistence of competition between spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation\nin the superconducting state. In addition, the electronic band structure\ncalculations demonstrate that the strength of electron susceptibility is\nsuppressed gradually by the Pd dopant suggesting the incompatible relation\nbetween spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation, which is also consistent\nwith experimental measurements. Our results provide significant insights in the\nnatures of the interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and the electron\ncorrelation in superconductivity, and may pave a way for understanding the\nmechanism of superconductivity in this 5d-metal-based compound.\n", "  We present a tool to compute the influence of charge-sign dependent solar\nmodulation for cosmic ray spectra. The code is publicly available, easy to use\nand offers an extended view on solar modulation compared to the force-field\napproximation. We present some examples for proton and antiproton fluxes in the\nlight of recent experimental data.\n", "  Using an array of high-purity Compton-suppressed germanium detectors, we\nperformed an independent measurement of the $\\beta$-decay branching ratio from\n$^{12}\\mathrm{B}$ to the second-excited (Hoyle) state in $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$. Our\nresult is $0.64(11)\\%$, which is a factor $\\sim 2$ smaller than the previously\nestablished literature value, but is in agreement with another recent\nmeasurement. This could indicate that the Hoyle state is more clustered than\npreviously believed. The angular correlation of the Hoyle state $\\gamma$\ncascade has also been measured for the first time. It is consistent with\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  In this Article, we report on the observation of ferroelectric domain pattern\nin the whole volume of the ferroelectric barium titanate single crystal by\nmeans of the digital holographic microscopy (DHM). Our particular\nimplementation of DHM is based on the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the\nnumerical processing of data employs the angular spectrum method. A\nmodification of the DHM technique, which allows a fast and accurate\ndetermination of the domain walls, i.e. narrow regions separating the\nantiparallel domains, is presented. Accuracy and sensitivity of the method are\ndiscussed. Using this approach, the determination of important geometric\nparameters of the ferroelectric domain patterns (such as domain spacing or the\nvolume fraction of the anti-parallel domains) is possible. In addition to the\nearlier DHM studies of domain patterns in lithium niobate and lithium\ntantalate, our results indicate that the DHM is a convenient method to study a\ndynamic evolution of ferroelectric domain patterns in all perovskite single\ncrystals.\n", "  Orbital period in a ring accelerator and time of flight in a linear\naccelerator depend on the amplitude of betatron oscillations. The variation is\nnegligible in ordinary particle accelerators with relatively small beam\nemittance. In an accelerator for large emittance beams like muons and unstable\nnuclei, however, this effect cannot be ignored. We measured orbital period in a\nlinear non-scaling fixed field alternating gradient (FFAG) accelerator, which\nis a candidate for muon acceleration, and compared with the theoretical\nprediction. The good agreement between them gives important ground for the\ndesign of particle accelerators for a new generation of particle and nuclear\nphysics experiments.\n", "  The chemical master equation (CME) is the exact mathematical formulation of\nchemical reactions occurring in a dilute and well-mixed volume. The\nreaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a stochastic description of\nreaction-diffusion processes on a spatial lattice, assuming well-mixing only on\nthe length scale of the lattice. It is clear that, for the sake of consistency,\nthe solution of the RDME of a chemical system should converge to the solution\nof the CME of the same system in the limit of fast diffusion: indeed, this has\nbeen tacitly assumed in most literature concerning the RDME. We show that, in\nthe limit of fast diffusion, the RDME indeed converges to a master equation,\nbut not necessarily the CME. We introduce a class of propensity functions, such\nthat if the RDME has propensities exclusively of this class then the RDME\nconverges to the CME of the same system; while if the RDME has propensities not\nin this class then convergence is not guaranteed. These are revealed to be\nelementary and non-elementary propensities respectively. We also show that\nindependent of the type of propensity, the RDME converges to the CME in the\nsimultaneous limit of fast diffusion and large volumes. We illustrate our\nresults with some simple example systems, and argue that the RDME cannot be an\naccurate description of systems with non-elementary rates.\n", "  This paper proposes a novel method for resonant slow extraction in\nsynchrotrons by using special anti-symmetric sextupole fields, which can be\nproduced by a special magnet structure. The method has the potential in\napplications demanding for very stable slow extraction from synchrotrons. Our\nstudies show that the slow extraction at the half-integer resonance by using\nanti-symmetric sextupole field has some advantages compared to the normal\nsextupole field, and the latter is widely used in the slow extraction method.\nOne of them is that it can work at a more distant tune from the resonance, so\nthat it can reduce significantly the intensity variation of the extracted beam\nwhich is mainly caused by the ripples of magnet power supplies. The studies by\nboth the Hamiltonian theory and numerical simulations show that the stable\nregion at the proximity of the half-integer resonance by anti-symmetric\nsextupole field is much smaller and flatter than the one by standard sextupole\nfield at the third-order resonance. By gradually increasing the field strength,\nthe beam can be extracted with intensity more homogeneous than by the usual\nthird-order resonant method, in the means of both smaller intensity variation\nand spike in the beginning spill. Similar to the case with a normal sextupole,\nwe derive an empirical formula for the area of the stable region with an\nanti-symmetric sextupole. One can find that with the same field strength and\nthe same tune distance to the resonance, the area of stable region or the\nchange of the area due to the working point variation in the case of\nanti-symmetric sextupole is about 1/14 of the one in the case of standard\nsextupole. The detailed studies including beam dynamic behaviors at the\nproximity of other resonances, influence of 2-D field error, half-integer\nstop-band, and resonant slow extraction by using quadrupole field have also\nbeen presented.\n", "  We study layered systems and heterostructures of s-wave superconductors by\nmeans of a suitable generalization of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory. In order to\nreduce the computational effort, we consider an embedding scheme in which a\nrelatively small number of active layers is embedded in an effective potential\naccounting for the effect of the rest of the system. We introduce a feedback of\nthe active layers on the embedding potential that improves on previous\napproaches and essentially eliminates the effects of the finiteness of the\nactive slab allowing for cheap computation of very large systems. We extend the\nmethod to the superconducting state, and we benchmark the approach by means of\nsimple paradigmatic examples showing some examples on how an interface affects\nthe superconducting properties. As examples, we show that superconductivity can\npenetrate from an intermediate coupling superconductor into a weaker coupling\none for around ten layers, and that the first two layers of a system with\nrepulsive interaction can turn superconducting by proximity effects even when\ncharge redistribution is inhibited.\n", "  Remarkable results have been published recently on the $\\beta$ decay of\n$^{56}$Zn. In particular, the rare and exotic $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$-proton\nemission has been detected for the first time in the $fp$ shell. Here we focus\nthe discussion on this exotic decay mode and on the observed competition\nbetween $\\beta$-delayed protons and $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ rays from the\nIsobaric Analogue State.\n", "  We present an analytic computation of Detweiler's redshift invariant for a\npoint mass in a circular orbit around a Kerr black hole, giving results up to\n8.5 post-Newtonian order while making no assumptions on the magnitude of the\nspin of the black hole. Our calculation is based on the functional series\nmethod of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi, and employs a rigorous mode-sum\nregularization prescription based on the Detweiler-Whiting singular-regular\ndecomposition. The approximations used in our approach are minimal; we use the\nstandard self-force expansion to linear order in the mass ratio, and the\nstandard post-Newtonian expansion in the separation of the binary. A key\nadvantage of this approach is that it produces expressions that include\ncontributions at all orders in the spin of the Kerr black hole. While this work\napplies the method to the specific case of Detweiler's redshift invariant, it\ncan be readily extended to other gauge invariant quantities and to higher\npost-Newtonian orders.\n", "  We study the embedding of inflation with nilpotent multiplets in\nsupergravity, in particular the decoupling of the sgoldstino scalar field.\nInstead of being imposed by hand, the nilpotency constraint on the goldstino\nmultiplet arises in the low energy-effective theory by integrating out heavy\ndegrees of freedom. We present explicit supergravity models in which a large\nbut finite sgoldstino mass arises from Yukawa or gauge interactions. In both\ncases the inflaton potential receives two types of corrections. One is from the\nbackreaction of the sgoldstino, the other from the heavy fields generating its\nmass. We show that these scale oppositely with the Volkov-Akulov cut-off scale,\nwhich makes a consistent decoupling of the sgoldstino nontrivial. Still, we\nidentify a parameter window in which sgoldstino-less inflation can take place,\nup to corrections which flatten the inflaton potential.\n", "  We consider accretion-caused deceleration of a gravitationally-powerful\ncompact stellar object traveling within a cold Fermi-gas medium. We provide\nanalytical and numerical estimates of the effect manifestation.\n", "  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a project to design,\nconstruct and operate a next-generation long-baseline neutrino detector with a\nliquid argon (LAr) target capable also of searching for proton decay and\nsupernova neutrinos. It is a merger of previous efforts of the LBNE and LBNO\ncollaborations, as well as other interested parties to pursue a broad programme\nwith a staged 40 kt LAr detector at the Sanford Underground Research Facility\n(SURF) 1300 km from Fermilab. This programme includes studies of neutrino\noscillations with a powerful neutrino beam from Fermilab, as well as proton\ndecay and supernova neutrino burst searches. In this paper we will focus on the\nunderground physics with DUNE.\n", "  We consider a resonant SIMP dark matter in models with two singlet complex\nscalar fields charged under a local dark $U(1)_D$. After the $U(1)_D$ is broken\ndown to a $Z_5$ discrete subgroup, the lighter scalar field becomes a SIMP dark\nmatter which has the enhanced $3\\rightarrow 2$ annihilation cross section near\nthe resonance of the heavier scalar field. Bounds on the SIMP self-scattering\ncross section and the relic density can be fulfilled at the same time for\nperturbative couplings of SIMP. A small gauge kinetic mixing between the SM\nhypercharge and dark gauge bosons can be used to make SIMP dark matter in\nkinetic equilibrium with the SM during freeze-out.\n", "  Persistent homology analysis, a recently developed computational method in\nalgebraic topology, is applied to the study of the phase transitions undergone\nby the so-called XY-mean field model and by the phi^4 lattice model,\nrespectively. For both models the relationship between phase transitions and\nthe topological properties of certain submanifolds of configuration space are\nexactly known. It turns out that these a-priori known facts are clearly\nretrieved by persistent homology analysis of dynamically sampled submanifolds\nof configuration space.\n", "  The MAJORANA collaboration is constructing the MAJORANA DEMONSTATOR at the\nSanford Underground Research Facility at the Homestake gold mine, in Lead, SD.\nThe apparatus will use Ge detectors, enriched in isotope \\nuc{76}{Ge}, to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of a large-scale Ge detector experiment to search\nfor neutrinoless double beta decay. The long half-life of this postulated\nprocess requires that the apparatus be extremely low in radioactive isotopes\nwhose decays may produce backgrounds to the search. The radioassay program\nconducted by the collaboration to ensure that the materials comprising the\napparatus are sufficiently pure is described. The resulting measurements of the\nradioactive-isotope contamination for a number of materials studied for use in\nthe detector are reported.\n", "  We examine transient circular dichroism spectroscopy (TRCD) as a technique to\ninvestigate signatures of exciton coherence dynamics under the influence of\nstructured vibrational environments. We consider a pump-probe configuration\nwith a linearly polarized pump and a circularly polarized probe, with a\nvariable angle $\\theta$ between the two directions of propagation. In our\ntheoretical formalism the signal is decomposed in chiral and achiral doorway\nand window functions. Using this formalism, we show that the chiral doorway\ncomponent, which beats during the population time, can be isolated by comparing\nsignals with different values of $\\theta$. As in the majority of time-resolved\npump-probe spectroscopy, the overall TRCD response shows signatures of both\nexcited and ground state dynamics. However, we demonstrate that the chiral\ndoorway function has only a weak ground state contribution, which can generally\nbe neglected if an impulsive pump pulse is used. These findings suggest that\nthe pump-probe configuration of optical TRCD in the impulsive limit has the\npotential to unambiguously probe quantum coherence beating in the excited\nstate. We present numerical results for theoretical signals in an example dimer\nsystem.\n", "  In recent years, the progress on low temperature detector technologies has\nallowed design of large scale experiments aiming at pushing down the\nsensitivity on the neutrino mass below 1\\,eV. Even with outstanding\nperformances in both energy ($\\sim$eV on keV) and time resolution ($\\sim\n1\\,\\mu$s) on the single channel, a large number of detectors working in\nparallel is required to reach a sub-eV sensitivity. HOLMES is a new experiment\nto directly measure the neutrino mass with a sensitivity as low as 2\\,eV.\nHOLMES will perform a calorimetric measurement of the energy released in the\nelectron capture (EC) decay of 163Ho. In its final configuration, HOLMES will\ndeploy 1000 detectors of low temperature microcalorimeters with implanted 163Ho\nnuclei. The baseline sensors for HOLMES are Mo/Cu TESs (Transition Edge\nSensors) on SiN\\textsubscript{x} membrane with gold absorbers. The readout is\nbased on the use of rf-SQUIDs as input devices with flux ramp modulation for\nlinearization purposes; the rf-SQUID is then coupled to a superconducting\nlambda/4-wave resonator in the GHz range, and the modulated signal is finally\nread out using the homodyne technique. The TES detectors have been designed\nwith the aim of achieving an energy resolution of a few eV at the spectrum\nendpoint and a time resolution of a few micro-seconds, in order to minimize\npile-up artifacts.\n", "  We construct the non-linear realisation of the semi-direct product of E11 and\nits vector representation in eleven dimensions and find the dynamical equations\nit predicts at low levels. These equations are completely determined by the\nnon-linear realisation and when restricted to contain only the usual fields of\nsupergravity and the usual space-time we find precisely the equations of motion\nof eleven dimensional supergravity. This paper extends the results announced in\narXiv:1512.01644 and in particular it contains the contributions to the\nequations of motion that involve derivatives with respect to the level one\ngeneralised coordinates.\n", "  A novel polarisation modulation scheme for polarimeters based on Fabry-Perot\ncavities is presented. The application to the proposed HERA-X experiment aiming\nto measuring the magnetic birefringence of vacuum with the HERA superconducting\nmagnets is discussed.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of the process $\\mu^-\\mu^+\\to HH$ to the\n$q^2$-dependence of the $HHH$ form factor, which can reflect the Higgs boson\nstructure, especially in the case of compositeness. We compute the Born and 1\nloop SM contribution to this process. We then show how the $\\mu^-\\mu^+\\to HH$\npolarized and unpolarized cross sections are modified by the presence of\nvarious types of anomalous contributions to the $HHH$ form factor, in\nparticular Higgs constituents in the case of compositeness.\n", "  We investigate general aspects of the mass defects of strange stars in the\ncontext of the Field Correlator Method, without magnetic field. The main\nparameters of the model that enter the corresponding nonperturbative equation\nof state of the quark gluon plasma are the gluon condensate $G_2$ and the large\ndistance static $Q{\\bar Q}$ potential $V_1$. We calculate mass defects of\nstellar configurations in the central density range $11<\\log\\rho_c<18$. In\ngeneral, the mass defects are strongly dependent on the model parameters. For a\nlarge range of values of $G_2$ and $V_1$, we obtain anomalous mass defects with\nmagnitudes around $10^{53}\\,$erg\\,, of the same order of the observed energies\nof gamma-ray bursts and neutrino emissions in SN1987A, and of the theoretically\npredicted energies of the quark-novae explosions.\n", "  The isotropic diffuse $\\gamma$-ray background (IGRB) has been detected by\nvarious experiments and recently the Fermi-LAT Collaboration has precisely\nmeasured its spectrum in a wide energy range. The origin of the IGRB is still\nunclear and we show in this paper the significative improvements that have been\ndone, thanks to the new Fermi-LAT catalogs, to solve this mystery. We\ndemonstrate that the $\\gamma$-ray intensity and spectrum of the IGRB is fully\nconsistent with the unresolved emission from extragalactic point sources,\nnamely Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Forming Galaxies. We show also that the\nIGRB can be employed to derive sever constraints for the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nfrom diffuse processes such as annihilation of Dark Matter (DM) particles. Our\nmethod is able to provide low bounds for the thermal annihilation cross section\nfor a wide range of DM masses.\n", "  We consider superconducting properties of a two-dimensional Dirac material\nsuch as graphene under strain that produces a flat band spectrum in the normal\nstate. We show that in the superconducting state, such a model results in a\nhighly increased critical temperature compared to the case without the strain,\ninhomogenous order parameter with two-peak shaped local density of states and\nyet a large and almost uniform and isotropic supercurrent. This model could be\nrealized in strained graphene or ultracold atom systems and could be\nresponsible for unusually strong superconductivity observed in some graphite\ninterfaces and certain IV-VI semiconductor heterostructures.\n", "  Recent advances in laser technology allow us to follow electronic motion at\nits natural time-scale with ultra-fast time resolution, leading the way towards\nattosecond physics experiments of extreme precision. In this work, we assess\nthe use of tailored pumps in order to enhance (or reduce) some given features\nof the probe absorption (for example, absorption in the visible range of\notherwise transparent samples). This type of manipulation of the system\nresponse could be helpful for its full characterization, since it would allow\nus to visualize transitions that are dark when using unshaped pulses. In order\nto investigate these possibilities, we perform first a theoretical analysis of\nthe non-equilibrium response function in this context, aided by one simple\nnumerical model of the Hydrogen atom. Then, we proceed to investigate the\nfeasibility of using time-dependent density-functional theory as a means to\nimplement, theoretically, this absorption-optimization idea, for more complex\natoms or molecules. We conclude that the proposed idea could in principle be\nbrought to the laboratory: tailored pump pulses can excite systems into\nlight-absorbing states. However, we also highlight the severe numerical and\ntheoretical difficulties posed by the problem: large-scale non-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics are cumbersome, even with TDDFT, and the shortcomings of\nstate-of-the-art TDDFT functionals may still be serious for these\nout-of-equilibrium situations.\n", "  We study the consistency of dynamical fermionic matter with the asymptotic\nsafety scenario of quantum gravity using the functional renormalisation group.\nSince this scenario suggests strongly coupled quantum gravity in the UV, one\nexpects gravity-induced fermion self-interactions at energies of the\nPlanck-scale. These could lead to chiral symmetry breaking at very high\nenergies and thus to large fermion masses in the IR. The present analysis which\nis based on the previous works \\cite{Christiansen:2015rva, Meibohm:2015twa},\nconcludes that gravity-induced chiral symmetry breaking at the Planck scale is\navoided for a general class of NJL-type models, regardless of the number of\nfermion flavours. This suggests that the phase diagram for these models is\ntopologically stable under the influence of gravitational interactions.\n", "  One of the most intriguing and challenging quests of current astrophysics is\nto understand the physical conditions and processes responsible for production\nof high-energy particles, and emission of \\gamma-rays. A combination of\nhigh-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images with broadband\nflux variability measurements is a unique way to probe the emission mechanisms\nat the bases of jets. Our analysis of \\gamma-ray flux variability observed by\nthe Fermi-LAT (Large Area Telescope) along with the parsec-scale jet kinematics\nsuggests that the $\\gamma$-ray emission in blazar S5 0716+714 has a significant\ncorrelation with the mm-VLBI core flux and the orientation of jet outflow on\nparsec scales. These results indicate that the inner jet morphology has a tight\nconnection with the observed $\\gamma$-ray flares. An overview of our current\nunderstanding on high-energy radiation processes, their origin, and location is\npresented here.\n", "  The magnetic-field dependencies of the longitudinal and Hall resistance of\nthe electron-doped compounds Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ in underdoped\nregion with $x$=0.14 and with varying degrees of disorder ($\\delta$) were\ninvestigated. It was established experimentally that the correlation between\nthe longitudinal electrical resistivity and the Hall resistivity can be\nanalyzed on the basis of scaling relationships: $\\rho_{xy}$($B$)$\\sim$\n$\\rho^{\\beta}_{xx}$($B$). For the totality of the investigated single-crystal\nfilms of Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$/SrTiO$_3$ the universal value\n$\\beta$=1.5 $\\pm$0.4 is found. The observed feature in the electron-doped\ntwo-dimensional systems can be associated both with a displaying of anisotropic\n$s$ - wave or $d$-wave pairing symmetry and with a rather strong pinning due to\nan essential degree of disorder in the samples under study.\n", "  The Flat Top Cavity, located in the PSI HIPA Ring Cyclotron leaks RF power of\nseveral kilo Watts into the cyclotrons vacuum space causing several\ncomplications. A detailed electromagnetic model was created and simulations\nperformed to analyze the mechanisms by which power is leaking out of the Flat\nTop Cavity. The tolerances needed to limit the leaked power in future\niterations of the Flat Top cavity are reported. Comparison of the model to\nmeasurements are described as well as two potential methods to limit power\nleakage. These studies will have direct impact on future RF cavity designs for\ncyclotrons as power levels increase and higher RF fields are required.\n", "  We study an integrable spin chain with three spin interactions and the\nstaggered field ($\\lambda$) while the latter is quenched either slowly (in a\nlinear fashion in time ($t$) as $t/\\tau$ where $t$ goes from a large negative\nvalue to a large positive value and $\\tau$ is the inverse rate of quenching) or\nsuddenly. In the process, the system crosses quantum critical points and\ngapless phases. We address the question whether there exist non-analyticities\n(known as dynamical phase transitions (DPTs)) in the subsequent real time\nevolution of the state (reached following the quench) governed by the final\ntime-independent Hamiltonian. In the case of sufficiently slow quenching (when\n$\\tau$ exceeds a critical value $\\tau_1$), we show that DPTs, of the form\nsimilar to those occurring for quenching across an isolated critical point, can\noccur even when the system is slowly driven across more than one critical point\nand gapless phases. More interestingly, in the anisotropic situation we show\nthat DPTs can completely disappear for some values of the anisotropy term\n($\\gamma$) and $\\tau$, thereby establishing the existence of boundaries in the\n$(\\gamma-\\tau)$ plane between the DPT and no-DPT regions in both isotropic and\nanisotropic cases. Our study therefore leads to a unique situation when DPTs\nmay not occur even when an integrable model is slowly ramped across a QCP. On\nthe other hand, considering sudden quenches from an initial value $\\lambda_i$\nto a final value $\\lambda_f$, we show that the condition for the presence of\nDPTs is governed by relations involving $\\lambda_i$, $\\lambda_f$ and $\\gamma$\nand the spin chain must be swept across $\\lambda=0$ for DPTs to occur.\n", "  We will review the production of neutrinos with PeV energies and above.\nDiscussing two possible sources of this radiation: the propagation of ultra\nhigh energy cosmic rays and the decay of super heavy dark matter. The\ndiscussion will focus on the theoretical expectations on neutrino fluxes and on\nthe detection capabilities of present and future experiments.\n", "  The LUMINEU is designed to investigate the possibility to search for\nneutrinoless double beta decay in $^{100}$Mo by means of a large array of\nscintillating bolometers based on ZnMoO$_4$ crystals enriched in $^{100}$Mo.\nHigh energy resolution and relatively fast detectors, which are able to measure\nboth the light and the heat generated upon the interaction of a particle in a\ncrystal, are very promising for the recognition and rejection of background\nevents. We present the LUMINEU concepts and the experimental results achieved\naboveground and underground with large-mass natural and enriched crystals. The\nmeasured energy resolution, the $\\alpha/\\beta$ discrimination power and the\nradioactive internal contamination are all within the specifications for the\nprojected final LUMINEU sensitivity. Simulations and preliminary results\nconfirm that the LUMINEU technology can reach zero background in the region of\ninterest (around 3 MeV) with exposures of the order of hundreds\nkg$\\times$years, setting the bases for a next generation $0\\nu2\\beta$ decay\nexperiment capable to explore the inverted hierarchy region of the neutrino\nmass pattern.\n", "  One proposal by Verlinde \\cite{Verlinde:2010hp} is that gravity is not a\nfundamental, but an entropic force. In this way, Verlinde has provide us with a\nway to derive the Newton's law of gravitation from the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy-area formula. On the other hand, since it has been demonstrated that\nthis formula is susceptible to quantum gravity corrections, one may hope that\nthese corrections could be inherited by the Newton's law. In this way, the\nentropic interpretation of Newton's law could be a prolific way in order to get\nverifiable or falsifiable quantum corrections to ordinary gravity in an\nobservationally accessible regimes. Loop quantum gravity is a theory that\nprovide a way to approach the quantum properties of spacetime. From this\ntheory, emerges a quantum corrected semiclassical black hole solution called\nloop quantum black holes or self-dual black holes. Among the interesting\nfeatures of loop quantum black holes is the fact that they give rise to a\nmodified entropy-area relation where quantum gravity corrections are present.\nIn this work, we obtain the quantum corrected Newton's law from the\nentropy-area relation given by loop quantum black holes. In order to relate our\nresults with the recent experimental activity, we consider the quantum\nmechanical properties of a huge gravitational atom consisting in a light\nneutral elementary particle in the presence of a loop quantum black hole.\n", "  The gluon mass generation is a purely non-perturbative effect, and the\nnatural framework to study it in the continuum are the Schwinger-Dyson\nequations (SDEs) of the theory. At the level of the SDEs the generation of such\na mass is associated with the existence of infrared finite solutions for the\ngluon propagator. From the theoretical point of view, the dynamical gluon mass\ngeneration has been traditionally plagued with seagull divergences. In this\nwork, we will review how such divergences can be eliminated completely by\nvirtue of a characteristic identity, valid in dimensional regularization. As a\npedagogical example, we will first discuss in the context of scalar QED how it\nis possible to eliminate all seagull divergences, by triggering the\naforementioned special identity, which enforces the masslessness of the photon.\nThen, we will discuss what happens in QCD and present an Ansatz for the three\ngluon vertex, which completely eliminates all seagull divergences and at same\ntime allows for the possibility of a dynamical gluon mass generation.\n", "  We highlight the progress in our understanding of how neutrinos change their\nflavor in astrophysical environments, in particular effects from the neutrino\nself-interaction. We emphasize extended descriptions of neutrino propagation in\nmassive stars that are beyond the current one based on the mean-field\napproximation. The extended equations include, in particular, corrections from\n(anti)neutrino-(anti)neutrino pairing correlations and from the neutrino mass.\nWe underline open issues and challenges.\n", "  We investigate the electronic structure of a triatomic Rydberg molecule\nformed by a Rydberg atom and two neutral ground-state atoms. Taking into\naccount the $s$-wave and $p$-wave interactions we perform electronic structure\ncalculations and analyze the adiabatic electronic potentials evolving from the\nRb$(n=35, l\\ge 3)$ Rydberg degenerate manifold. We hereby focus on three\ndifferent classes of geometries of the Rydberg molecules, including symmetric,\nasymmetric and planar configurations. The metamorphosis of these potential\nenergy surfaces in the presence of an external electric field is explored.\n", "  [Abridged] The Shocked POststarburst Galaxy Survey (SPOGS) aims to identify\ntransforming galaxies, in which the nebular lines are excited via shocks\ninstead of through star formation processes. Utilizing the OSSY measurements on\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 catalog, we applied Balmer\nabsorption and shock boundary criteria to identify 1,067 SPOG candidates\n(SPOGs*) within z=0.2. SPOGs* represent 0.2% of the OSSY sample galaxies that\nexceed the continuum signal-to-noise cut (and 0.7% of the emission line galaxy\nsample). SPOGs* colors suggest that they are in an earlier phase of transition\nthan OSSY galaxies that meet an E+A selection. SPOGs* have a 13% 1.4GHz\ndetection rate from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters\nsurvey, higher than most other subsamples, and comparable only to\nlow-ionization nuclear emission line region hosts, suggestive of the presence\nof active galactic nuclei. SPOGs* also have stronger NaD absorption than\npredicted from the stellar population, suggestive of cool gas being driven out\nin galactic winds. It appears that SPOGs* represent an earlier phase in galaxy\ntransformation than traditionally selected poststarburst galaxies, and that a\nlarge proportion of SPOGs* also have properties consistent with disruption of\ntheir interstellar media, a key component to galaxy transformation. It is\nlikely that many of the known pathways to transformation undergo a SPOG phase.\nStudying this sample of SPOGs* further, including their morphologies, active\ngalactic nuclei properties, and environments, has the potential for us to build\na more complete picture of the initial conditions that can lead to a galaxy\nevolving.\n", "  The MINOS experiment ran from 2003 until 2012 and collected a data sample\nincluding 10.71x10^20 protons-on-target (POT) of beam neutrinos, 3.36x10^20 POT\nof beam antineutrinos and an atmospheric neutrino exposure of 37.88 kt-yrs. The\nfinal measurement of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation parameters, dm^2_32\nand theta_23, came from a full three flavour oscillation analysis of the\ncombined CC nu_mu and CC anti-nu_mu beam and atmospheric samples and the CC\nnu_e and CC anti-nu_e appearance samples. This analysis yielded the most\nprecise measurement of the atmospheric mass splitting dm^2_32 performed to\ndate. The results are |dm^2_32|=[2.28 - 2.46]x10^-3 eV^2 (68\\%) and\nsin^{2}theta_23=0.35-0.65$ (90\\%) in the normal hierarchy, and |dm^2_32|=[2.32\n- 2.53]x10^-3 eV^2 (68\\%) and sin^{2}theta_23=0.34-0.67 (90\\%) in the inverted\nhierarchy. The successor to MINOS in the NOvA era at FNAL, MINOS+, is now\ncollecting data mostly in the 3-10 GeV region, and an analysis of nu_mu\ndisappearance using the first 2.99x10^20 POT of data produced results very\nconsistent with those from MINOS. Future data will further test the standard\nneutrino oscillation paradigm and allow for improved searches for exotic\nphenomena including sterile neutrinos, large extra dimensions and non-standard\ninteractions.\n", "  We report on a high-statistics measurement of the most basic double pionic\nfusion reaction $\\vec{n}p \\to d\\pi^0\\pi^0$ over the energy region of the\n$d^*(2380)$ resonance by use of a polarized deuteron beam and observing the\ndouble fusion reaction in the quasifree scattering mode. The measurements were\nperformed with the WASA detector setup at COSY. The data reveal substantial\nanalyzing powers and confirm conclusions about the $d^*$ resonance obtained\nfrom unpolarized measurements. We also confirm the previous unpolarized data\nobtained under complementary kinematic conditions.\n", "  Metasurfaces are artificial electromagnetic boundaries or interfaces usually\nimplemented as two-dimensional periodic structures with subwavelength\nperiodicity and engineered properties of constituent unit cells. The\nelectromagnetic bandgap (EBG) effect in metasurfaces prevents all surface modes\nfrom propagating in a certain frequency band. While metasurfaces provide a\nnumber of important applications in microwave antennas and antenna arrays,\ntheir features are also highly suitable for MRI applications. In this work we\nmanufacture and experimentally study finite samples based on mushroom-type EBG\nmetasurfaces and employ them for suppression of inter-element coupling in\ndipole transmit coil arrays for body imaging at 7T. We show experimentally that\nemployment of the samples EBG leads to reduction of coupling between adjacent\nclosely-spaced dipole antenna elements of a 7T transmit/receive body array,\nwhich reduces scattering losses in neighboring channels and thereby improves\nthe B1+ efficiency. The setup consists of two fractionated dipole antennas\npreviously designed by the authors for body imaging at 7 Tesla. These are\nplaced on top of a body-mimicking phantom and equipped with the manufactured\nfinite-size sample of the metasurface tuned to have EBG properties at the\nLarmor frequency of 298 MHz. To improve the detection range of the B1+ field\ndistribution of the top elements, four additional elements were positioned\nalong the bottom side of the phantom. Scattering matrix measurements show that\ncoupling between the two top elements is indeed reduced while the measurements\nperformed on a 7T MRI machine confirm the array's B1+ efficiency improvement\ndue to reduced scattering losses. This study provides a tool for the decoupling\nof dipole antennas in ultrahigh field transmit arrays, possibly resulting in\ndenser element placement and/or larger subject-element spacing.\n", "  Itinerant magnets generally exhibit pressure induced transitions towards non\nmagnetic states. Using synchrotron based X-ray diffraction and emission\nspectroscopy, the evolution of the lattice and spin moment in the chiral magnet\nMnGe was investigated in the paramagnetic state and under pressures up to 38\nGPa. The collapse of spin-moment takes place in two steps. A first-order\ntransition with a huge hysteresis around 7 GPa transforms the system from the\nhigh-spin at ambient pressure to a low-spin state. The coexistence of\nspin-states and observation of history-depending irreversibility is explained\nas effect of long-range elastic strains mediated by magnetovolume coupling.\nOnly in a second transition, at about 23 GPa, the spin-moment collapses.\n", "  The fermionic and Majorana edge mode dynamics of various topological systems\nis compared, after a sudden global quench of the Hamiltonian parameters takes\nplace. Attention is focused on the regimes where the survival probability of an\nedge state has oscillations either due to critical or off-critical quenches.\nThe nature of the wave functions and the overlaps between the eigenstates of\ndifferent points in parameter space determine the various types of behaviors,\nand the distinction due to the Majorana nature of the excitations plays a\nlesser role. Performing a sequence of quenches it is shown that the edge\nstates, including Majorana modes, may be switched off and on. Also, the\ngeneration of Majoranas due to quenching from a trivial phase is discussed.\n", "  The Aurora experiment to investigate double beta decay of $^{116}$Cd with the\nhelp of 1.162 kg cadmium tungstate crystal scintillators enriched in $^{116}$Cd\nto 82\\% is in progress at the Gran Sasso Underground Laboratory. The half-life\nof $^{116}$Cd relatively to the two neutrino double beta decay is measured with\nthe highest up-to-date accuracy $T_{1/2}=(2.62\\pm0.14)\\times10^{19}$ yr. The\nsensitivity of the experiment to the neutrinoless double beta decay of\n$^{116}$Cd to the ground state of $^{116}$Sn is estimated as $T_{1/2} \\geq\n1.9\\times10^{23}$ yr at 90\\% CL, which corresponds to the effective Majorana\nneutrino mass limit $\\langle m_{\\nu}\\rangle \\leq (1.2-1.8)$ eV. New limits are\nobtained for the double beta decay of $^{116}$Cd to the excited levels of\n$^{116}$Sn, and for the neutrinoless double beta decay with emission of\nmajorons.\n", "  We construct sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars in dilatonic\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, employing two equations of state for the nuclear\nmatter. We analyze the dependence of the physical properties of these neutron\nstars on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling strength. For a given equation of state we\ndetermine the physically relevant domain of rapidly rotating neutron stars,\nwhich is delimited by the set of neutron stars rotating at the Kepler limit,\nthe set of neutron stars along the secular instability line, and the set of\nstatic neutron stars. As compared to Einstein gravity, the presence of the\nGauss-Bonnet term decreases this domain, leading to lower values for the\nmaximum mass as well as to smaller central densities. The quadrupole moment is\ndecreased by the Gauss-Bonnet term for rapidly rotating neutron stars, while it\nis increased for slowly rotating neutron stars. The universal relation between\nthe quadrupole moment and the moment of inertia found in General Relativity\nappears to extend to dilatonic Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with very little\ndependence on the coupling strength of the Gauss-Bonnet term. The neutron stars\ncarry a small dilaton charge.\n", "  We show that the correlations generated in the ground state of $N=Z$ nuclei\nby the isovector and isoscalar pairing forces can be treated with high\nprecision as a condensate of alpha-like quartets. To treat these correlations,\nthe quartet condensation model (QCM) is extended to the treatment of\nspherically symmetric isovector $(T=1,J=0)$ and isoscalar $(T=0,J=1)$ pairing\nforces . Within QCM we discuss the competition between $T=1$ and $T=0$ pairing\ncorrelations in the case of a two-level model and for $N=Z$ nuclei with\nnucleons moving in the open shells above $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{100}$Sn. We\nshow that in $N=Z$ systems isovector and isoscalar proton-neutron pairing\ncorrelations always coexist.\n", "  All-sky explorations by Fermi-LAT have revolutionized our view of the\ngamma-ray sky. While its ongoing all-sky survey counts thousands of sources,\nessential issues related to the nature of unassociated sources call for\nsensitive all-sky surveys at hard X-ray energies that allow for their\nidentification. We present the results of the association of the Fermi-LAT\nsecond source catalog to hard X-ray detected sources.\n", "  A radiopure cadmium tungstate crystal scintillator, enriched in 106-Cd to\n66%, with mass of 216 g (106-CdWO4) was used in coincidence with four ultra-low\nbackground HPGe detectors contained in a single cryostat to search for double\nbeta decay processes in 106-Cd. New improved half-life limits on the double\nbeta processes in 106-Cd have been set on the level of 1e20-1e21 yr after 13085\nh of data taking deep underground (3600 m w.e.) at the Gran Sasso National\nLaboratories of INFN (Italy). In particular, the limit on the two neutrino\nelectron capture with positron emission T1/2 >1.1e21 yr, has reached the region\nof theoretical predictions. The resonant neutrinoless double electron captures\nto the 2718, 2741 and 2748 keV excited states of 106-Pd are restricted on the\nlevel of T1/2 > 8.5e20 - 1.4e21 yr.\n", "  Low background experiments need a suppression of cosmogenically induced\nevents. The GERDA experiment located at LNGS is searching for the neutrinless\ndouble beta decay of $^{76}$Ge. It is equipped with an active muon veto the\nmain part of which is a water Cherenkov veto with 66 PMTs in the watertank\nsurrounding the GERDA cryostat. With this system 806 live days have been\nrecorded, 491 days were combined muon-germanium data. A muon detection\nefficiency of $\\varepsilon_{\\mu d}=(99.935\\pm0.015)$ \\% was found in a Monte\nCarlo simulation for the muons depositing energy in the germanium detectors. By\nexamining coincident muon-germanium events a rejection efficiency of\n$\\varepsilon_{\\mu r}=(99.2_{-0.4}^{+0.3})$ \\% was found. Without veto condition\nthe muons by themselves would cause a background index of\n$\\textrm{BI}_{\\mu}=(3.16 \\pm 0.85)\\times10^{-3}$ cts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$yr) at\n$Q_{\\beta\\beta}$.\n", "  We revisit the inflection point inflation with an extended discussion to\nlarge field values and consider the reheating effects on the inflationary\npredictions. Parametrizing the reheating dynamics in terms of the reheating\ntemperature and the equation of state during inflation, we show how the\nobservationally favored parameter space of inflection point inflation is\naffected by reheating dynamics. Consequently, we apply the general results to\nthe inflation models with non-minimal coupling, such as the SM Higgs inflation\nand the $B-L$ Higgs inflation.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are an interesting subclass of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), which tipically does not exhibit any strong radio\nemission. Seven percent of them, though, are radio-loud and often show a flat\nradio-spectrum (F-NLS1s). This, along to the detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission\ncoming from them, is usually interpreted as a sign of a relativistic beamed jet\noriented along the line of sight. An important aspect of these AGN that must be\nunderstood is the nature of their parent population, in other words how do they\nappear when observed under different angles. In the recent literature it has\nbeen proposed that a specific class of radio-galaxies, compact-steep sources\n(CSS) classified as high excitation radio galaxies (HERG), can represent the\nparent population of F-NLS1s. To test this hypothesis in a quantitative way,in\nthis paper we analyzed the only two statistically complete samples of CSS/HERGs\nand F-NLS1s available in the literature. We derived the black hole mass and\nEddington ratio distributions, and we built for the first time the radio\nluminosity function of F-NLS1s. Finally, we applied a relativistic beaming\nmodel to the luminosity function of CSS/HERGs, and compared the result with the\nobserved function of F-NLS1s. We found that compact steep-spectrum sources are\nvalid parent candidates and that F-NLS1s, when observed with a different\ninclination, might actually appear as CSS/HERGs.\n", "  It is demonstrated how an utilization of all existing experimental\ninformation on electric and magnetic nucleon form factors, to be described by\nthe Unitary and Analytic (U\\&A) nucleon electromagnetic structure model in\nspace-like and time-like regions simultaneously, can provide numerical values\nof $f^F$, $f^D$, $f^S$ coupling constants in $SU(3)$ invariant interaction\nLagrangian of the vector-meson nonet with $1/2^+$ octet baryons. The latter,\ntogether with universal vector-meson coupling constants $f_V$, play an\nessential role in a prediction of $1/2^+$ octet hyperon electromagnetic form\nfactors behaviors.\n", "  In the quantum world, a single particle can have various degrees of freedom\nto encode quantum information. Controlling multiple degrees of freedom\nsimultaneously is necessary to describe a particle fully and, therefore, to use\nit more efficiently. Here we introduce the transverse waveguide-mode degree of\nfreedom to quantum photonic integrated circuits, and demonstrate the coherent\nconversion of a photonic quantum state between path, polarization and\ntransverse waveguide-mode degrees of freedom on a single chip. The preservation\nof quantum coherence in these conversion processes is proven by single-photon\nand two-photon quantum interference using a fibre beam splitter or on-chip beam\nsplitters. These results provide us with the ability to control and convert\nmultiple degrees of freedom of photons for quantum photonic integrated\ncircuit-based quantum information process.\n", "  We consider the 3D Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. We investigate the joint\nprobability distribution pi_n(L) for an arbitrarily selected cell face to be\nn-edged and for the distance between the seeds of its adjacent cells to be\nequal to 2L. We derive an exact expression for this quantity, valid in the\nlimit n->infty with n^{1/6}L fixed. The leading order correction term is\ndetermined. Good agreement with earlier Monte Carlo data is obtained. The cell\nface is surrounded by a three-dimensional excluded domain that is the union of\nn balls; it is pumpkin-shaped and analogous to the flower of the 2D Voronoi\ncell. For n->infty this domain tends towards a torus of equal major and minor\nradii. The radii scale as n^{1/3}, in agreement with earlier heuristic work. We\nachieve a detailed understanding of several other statistical properties of the\nn-edged cell face.\n", "  A new simple dynamo model for stellar activity cycle is proposed. By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches.\n", "  Global optimization of transition paths in complex atomic scale systems is\naddressed in the context of misfit dislocation formation in a strained Ge film\non Si(001). Such paths contain multiple intermediate minima connected by\nminimum energy paths on the energy surface emerging from the atomic\ninteractions in the system. The challenge is to find which intermediate states\nto include and to construct a path going through these intermediates in such a\nway that the overall activation energy for the transition is minimal. In the\nnumerical approach presented here, intermediate minima are constructed by\nheredity transformations of known minimum energy structures and by identifying\nlocal minima in minimum energy paths calculated using a modified version of the\nnudged elastic band method. Several mechanisms for the formation of a 90{\\deg}\nmisfit dislocation at the Ge-Si interface are identified when this method is\nused to construct transition paths connecting a homogeneously strained Ge film\nand a film containing a misfit dislocation. One of these mechanisms which has\nnot been reported in the literature is detailed. The activation energy for this\npath is calculated to be 26% smaller than the activation energy for half loop\nformation of a full, isolated 60{\\deg} dislocation. An extension of the common\nneighbor analysis method involving characterization of the geometrical\narrangement of second nearest neighbors is used to identify and visualize the\ndislocations and stacking faults.\n", "  Trapping ions in Paul traps requires high radio-frequency voltages, which are\ngenerated using resonators. When operating traps in a cryogenic environment, an\nin-vacuum resonator showing low loss is crucial to limit the thermal load to\nthe cryostat. In this study, we present a guide for the design and production\nof compact, shielded cryogenic resonators. We produced and characterized three\ndifferent types of resonators and furthermore demonstrate efficient impedance\nmatching of these resonators at cryogenic temperatures.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological applications of new gravitational\nscalar-tensor theories, which are novel modifications of gravity possessing 2+2\npropagating degrees of freedom, arising from a Lagrangian that includes the\nRicci scalar and its first and second derivatives. Extracting the field\nequations we obtain an effective dark energy sector that consists of both extra\nscalar degrees of freedom, and we determine various observables. We analyze two\nspecific models and we obtain a cosmological behavior in agreement with\nobservations, i.e. transition from matter to dark energy era, with the onset of\ncosmic acceleration. Additionally, for a particular range of the model\nparameters, the equation-of-state parameter of the effective dark energy sector\ncan exhibit the phantom-divide crossing. These features reveal the capabilities\nof these theories, since they arise solely from the novel, higher-derivative\nterms.\n", "  Cosmic rays (CRs) generate diffuse emission while interacting with the\nGalactic magnetic field (B-field), the interstellar gas and the radiation\nfield. This diffuse emission extends from radio, microwaves, through X-rays, to\nhigh-energy gamma rays. Diffuse emission has considerably increased the\ninterest of the astrophysical community due to recent detailed observations by\nPlanck, Fermi-LAT, and by very-high-energy Cherenkov telescopes. Observations\nof this emission and comparison with detailed predictions are used to gain\ninformation on the properties of CRs, such as their density, spectra,\ndistribution and propagation in the Galaxy. Unfortunately disentangling and\ncharacterizing this diffuse emission strongly depends on uncertainties in the\nknowledge of unresolved sources, gas, radiation fields, and B-fields, other\nthan CRs throughout the Galaxy. We report here on recent multiwavelength\nobservations of the Galactic diffuse emission, and discuss the diffuse emission\nproduced by CRs and its model uncertainties, comparing observations with\npredictions. The importance for forthcoming telescopes, especially for the\nSquare Kilometre Array Telescope (SKA) and the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA),\nand for future missions at MeV energies is also addressed.\n", "  The edges of torn plastic sheets and growing leaves often display\nhierarchical buckling patterns. We show that this complex morphology (i)\nemerges even in zero strain configurations, and (ii) is driven by a competition\nbetween the two principal curvatures, rather than between bending and\nstretching. We identify the key role of branch-point (or \"monkey-saddle\")\nsingularities in generating complex wrinkling patterns in isometric immersions,\nand show how they arise naturally from minimizing the elastic energy.\n", "  The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) is a versatile instrument\ndesigned for high-angular resolution and high-contrast infrared imaging (1.5-13\nmicrons). In this paper, we focus on the mid-infrared (8-13 microns) nulling\nmode and present its theory of operation, data reduction, and on-sky\nperformance as of the end of the commissioning phase in March 2015. With an\ninterferometric baseline of 14.4 meters, the LBTI nuller is specifically tuned\nto resolve the habitable zone of nearby main-sequence stars, where warm\nexozodiacal dust emission peaks. Measuring the exozodi luminosity function of\nnearby main-sequence stars is a key milestone to prepare for future exoEarth\ndirect imaging instruments. Thanks to recent progress in wavefront control and\nphase stabilization, as well as in data reduction techniques, the LBTI\ndemonstrated in February 2015 a calibrated null accuracy of 0.05% over a\nthree-hour long observing sequence on the bright nearby A3V star beta Leo. This\nis equivalent to an exozodiacal disk density of 15 to 30 zodi for a Sun-like\nstar located at 10pc, depending on the adopted disk model. This result sets a\nnew record for high-contrast mid-infrared interferometric imaging and opens a\nnew window on the study of planetary systems.\n", "  Droplet migration in a Hele--Shaw cell is a fundamental multiphase flow\nproblem which is crucial for many microfluidics applications. We focus on the\nregime at low capillary number and three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulations are performed to investigate the problem. In order to reduce the\ncomputational cost, an adaptive mesh is employed and high mesh resolution is\nonly used near the interface. Parametric studies are performed on the droplet\nhorizontal radius and the capillary number. For droplets with an horizontal\nradius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel\nand exhibits a pancake shape. A lubrication film is formed between the droplet\nand the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the lubrication\nfilm on the droplet velocity. The computed velocity of the pancake droplet is\nshown to be lower than the average inflow velocity, which is in agreement with\nexperimental measurements. The numerical results show that both the strong\nshear induced by the lubrication film and the three-dimensional flow structure\ncontribute to the low mobility of the droplet. In this low-migration-velocity\nscenario the interfacial flow in the droplet reference frame moves toward the\nrear on the top and reverses direction moving to the front from the two side\nedges. The velocity of the pancake droplet and the thickness of the lubrication\nfilm are observed to decrease with capillary number. The droplet velocity and\nits dependence on capillary number cannot be captured by the classic Hele--Shaw\nequations, since the depth-averaged approximation neglects the effect of the\nlubrication film.\n", "  We discuss production of $D^0 D^0$ (and ${\\bar D}^0 {\\bar D}^0$) pairs\nrelated to the LHCb Collaboration results for $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV in\nproton-proton scattering. We consider double-parton scattering (DPS) mechanisms\nof double $c \\bar c$ production and subsequent $cc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$\nhadronization as well as double $g$ and mixed $g c\\bar c $ production with $gg\n\\to D^{0}D^{0}$ and $gc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ hadronization calculated with the help\nof the scale-dependent hadronization functions of Kniehl et al. Single-parton\nscattering (SPS) mechanism of digluon production is also taken into account. We\ncompare our results with several correlation observables in azimuthal angle\n$\\varphi_{D^{0}D^{0}}$ between $D^{0}$ mesons or in dimeson invariant mass\n$M_{D^{0}D^{0}}$. The inclusion of new mechanisms with $g \\to D^{0}$\nfragmentation leads to larger cross sections, than when including only DPS\nmechanism with standard scale-independent $cc \\to D^{0}D^{0}$ fragmentation\nfunctions. Some consequences of the presence of the new mechanisms are\ndiscussed. In particular a larger $\\sigma_{eff}$ is needed to describe the LHCb\ndata. There is a signature that $\\sigma_{eff}$ may depend on transverse\nmomentum of $c$ quarks and/or $\\bar c$ antiquarks.\n", "  Isochronous mass spectrometry (IMS) in storage rings is a powerful tool for\nmass measurements of exotic nuclei with very short half-lives down to several\ntens of microseconds, using a multicomponent secondary beam separated in-flight\nwithout cooling. However, the inevitable momentum spread of secondary ions\nlimits the precision of nuclear masses determined by using IMS. Therefore, the\nmomentum measurement in addition to the revolution period of stored ions is\ncrucial to reduce the influence of the momentum spread on the standard\ndeviation of the revolution period, which would lead to a much improved mass\nresolving power of IMS. One of the proposals to upgrade IMS is that the\nvelocity of secondary ions could be directly measured by using two\ntime-of-flight (double TOF) detectors installed in a straight section of a\nstorage ring. In this paper, we outline the principle of IMS with double TOF\ndetectors and the method to correct the momentum spread of stored ions.\n", "  The existence of the ergoregion of the Kerr space-time has not been confirmed\nobservationally yet. We show that the confirmation would be possible by\nobserving the quasinormal mode in gravitational waves. As an example, using the\nrecent population synthesis results of Pop III binary black holes, we find that\nthe peak of the final merger mass ($M_f$) is about $50~\\rm M_{\\odot}$, while\nthe fraction of the final spin $q_f = a_f/M_f > 0.7$ needed for the\nconfirmation of a part of ergoregion is $\\sim 77\\%$. To confirm the frequency\nof the quasinormal mode, ${\\rm SNR} > 35$ is needed. The standard model of Pop\nIII population synthesis tells us that the event rate for the confirmation of\nmore than $50\\%$ of the ergoregion by the second generation gravitational wave\ndetectors is $\\sim 2.3$ ${\\rm events\\ yr^{-1}\\ (SFR_p/(10^{-2.5}\\ M_\\odot\nyr^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-3}))} \\cdot (\\rm [f_b/(1+f_b)]/0.33)$ where ${\\rm SFR_p}$ and\n${\\rm f_b}$ are the peak value of the Pop III star formation rate and the\nfraction of binaries, respectively.\n", "  We present a numerical model which allows us to study the Kelvin force probe\nmicroscopy response to the charge switching in quantum dots at various time\nscales. The model provides more insight into the behavior of frequency shift\nand dissipated energy under different scanning conditions measuring a\ntemporarily charged quantum dot on surface. Namely, we analyze the dependence\nof the frequency shift, its fluctuation and of the dissipated energy, on the\nresonance frequency of tip and electron tunneling rates between tip - quantum\ndot and quantum dot - sample. We discuss two complementary approaches to\nsimulating the charge dynamics, a stochastic and a deterministic one. In\naddition, we derive analytic formulas valid for small amplitudes, describing\nrelations between the frequency shift, dissipated energy, and the\ncharacteristic rates driving the charging and discharging processes.\n", "  Topological insulators are characterized by an inverted band structure in the\nbulk and metallic surface states on the surface. In LaBi, a semimetal with a\nband inversion equivalent to a topological insulator, we observe surface state\nlike behavior in the magnetoresistance. The electrons responsible for this\npseudo two dimensional transport, however, originate from the bulk states\nrather topological surface states, which is witnessed by the angle dependent\nquantum oscillations of the magnetoresistance and ab initio calculations. As a\nconsequence, the magnetoresistance exhibits strong anisotropy with large\namplitude (~ 10^5 %).\n", "  We use an explicitly isochoric two-temperature theory where the ion\ntemperature is not assumed to be equal to the electron temperature, to analyze\nrecent X-ray laser scattering data for Aluminum in the ultra-fast-matter (UFM)\nregime up to 6 eV, obtained at the Standford Linac Coherent Light Source\n(LCLS). The observed surprisingly low conductivities are explained by including\nstrong electron-ion scattering effects using the phase shifts calculated via\nthe density-functional neutral-pseudo-atom model (NPA). The applicability of\nthe Mermin model to UFM is questioned. The static and dynamic conductivity,\ncomplex collision frequency and the plasmon line-shape are evaluated within a\nBorn approximation and without the use of the Mermin response. This approach,\nwhere all needed quantities are obtained from the NPA model, provides good\nagreement with the reported experimental results.\n", "  A three species one-dimensional kinetic model is presented for a spatially\nhomogeneous weakly ionized plasma subjected to the action of a time varying\nelectric field. Planar geometry is assumed, which means that the plasma\ndynamics evolves in the privileged direction of the field. The energy\ntransmitted to the charges is be channelized to the neutrals thanks to\ncollisions and impacting the plasma dynamics. Charge-charge interactions have\nbeen designed as a one dimensional collision term equivalent to the Landau\noperator used for fully ionized plasmas. Charge-neutral collisions are modelled\nby a conservative drift diffusion operator in the Doughertys form. The\nresulting set of coupled drift diffusion equations is solved with the stable\nand robust Propagator Integral Method. This method feasibility accounts for\nnon-linear effects without appealing to linearisation or simplifications,\nproviding conservative physically meaningful solutions. It is found that charge\nneutral collisions exert a significant effect since a quite different plasma\ndynamics arises if compared to the collisionless limit. In addition,\nsubstantial differences in the system evolution are found for constant and\ntemperature dependent collision frequencies cases.\n", "  Within the standard 3nu mass-mixing framework, we present an up-to-date\nglobal analysis of neutrino oscillation data (as of January 2016), including\nthe latest available results from experiments with atmospheric neutrinos\n(Super-Kamiokande and IceCube DeepCore), at accelerators (first T2K anti-nu and\nNOvA nu runs in both appearance and disappearance mode), and at short-baseline\nreactors (Daya Bay and RENO far/near spectral ratios), as well as a reanalysis\nof older KamLAND data in the light of the \"bump\" feature recently observed in\nreactor spectra. We discuss improved constraints on the five known oscillation\nparameters (delta m^2, |Delta m^2|, sin^2theta_12, sin^2theta_13,\nsin^2theta_23), and the status of the three remaining unknown parameters: the\nmass hierarchy, the theta_23 octant, and the possible CP-violating phase delta.\nWith respect to previous global fits, we find that the reanalysis of KamLAND\ndata induces a slight decrease of both delta m^2 and sin^2theta_12, while the\nlatest accelerator and atmospheric data induce a slight increase of |Delta\nm^2|. Concerning the unknown parameters, we confirm the previous intriguing\npreference for negative values of sin(delta) [with best-fit values around\nsin(delta) ~ -0.9], but we find no statistically significant indication about\nthe theta_23 octant or the mass hierarchy (normal or inverted). Assuming an\nalternative (so-called LEM) analysis of NOvA data, some delta ranges can be\nexcluded at >3 sigma, and the normal mass hierarchy appears to be slightly\nfavored at 90% C.L. We also describe in detail the covariances of selected\npairs of oscillation parameters. Finally, we briefly discuss the implications\nof the above results on the three non-oscillation observables sensitive to the\n(unknown) absolute nu mass scale: the sum of nu masses, the effective nu_e\nmass, and the effective Majorana mass.\n", "  Understanding the spontaneous emergence of dislocation patterns during\nplastic deformation is a long standing challenge in dislocation theory. During\nthe past decades several phenomenological continuum models of dislocation\npatterning were proposed, but few of them (if any) are derived from microscopic\nconsiderations through systematic and controlled averaging procedures. In this\npaper we present a 2D continuum theory that is obtained by systematic averaging\nof the equations of motion of discrete dislocations. It is shown that in the\nevolution equations of the dislocation densities diffusion like terms neglected\nin earlier considerations play a crucial role in the length scale selection of\nthe dislocation density fluctuations. It is also shown that the formulated\ncontinuum theory can be derived from an averaged energy functional using the\nframework of phase field theories. However, in order to account for the flow\nstress one has in that case to introduce a nontrivial dislocation mobility\nfunction, which proves to be crucial for the instability leading to patterning.\n", "  We show that a strong infrared laser beam obliquely incident on graphene can\nexperience a parametric instability with respect to decay into lower-frequency\n(idler) photons and THz surface plasmons. The instability is due to a strong\nin-plane second-order nonlinear response of graphene which originates from its\nspatial dispersion. The parametric decay leads to efficient generation of THz\nplasmons and gives rise to quantum entanglement of idler photons and surface\nplasmon states. A similar process can be supported by surface states of\ntopological insulators such as Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  Driven by the growing interest in numerical simulations of\ndislocation-interface interactions in general crystalline materials with\nelastic anisotropy, we develop algorithms for the integration of interface\ntractions needed to couple dislocation dynamics with a finite element or\nboundary element solver. The dislocation stress fields in elastically\nanisotropic media are made analytically accessible through the spherical\nharmonics expansion of the derivative of Green's function, and analytical\nexpressions for the forces on interface elements are derived by analytically\nintegrating the spherical harmonics series recursively. Compared with numerical\nintegration by Gaussian quadrature, the newly developed analytical algorithm\nfor interface traction integration is highly beneficial in terms of both\ncomputation precision and speed.\n", "  Wetland biogeochemical transformations are affected by flow and mixing in\nwetland surface water. We investigate the influence of wind on wetland water\nflow by simultaneously measuring wind and surface water velocities in an\nenclosed freshwater wetland during one day of strong-wind conditions. Water\nvelocities are measured using a Volumetric Particle Imager while wind\nvelocities are measured via sonic-anemometer. Our measurements indicate that\nthe wind interacting with the vegetation canopy generates coherent billows and\nthat these billows are the dominant source of momentum into the wetland water\ncolumn. Spectral analysis of velocity timeseries shows that the spectral peak\nin water velocity is aligned with the spectral peak of in-canopy wind velocity,\nand that this peak corresponds with the Kelvin-Helmholtz billow frequency\npredicted by mixing layer theory. We also observe a strong correlation in the\ntemporal pattern of velocity variance in the air and water, with high variance\nevents having similar timing and duration both above and below the air-water\ninterface. Water-side variance appears coupled with air-side variance at least\ndown to 5 cm, while the theoretical Stokes' solution predicts momentum transfer\ndown to only 2 mm assuming transfer via molecular viscosity alone. This\nsuggests that the wind-driven flow contributed to significant mixing in the\nwetland water column.\n", "  The high-temperature superfluidity of two-dimensional dipolar excitons in two\nparallel TMDC layers is predicted. We study Bose-Einstein condensation in the\ntwo-component system of dipolar A and B excitons. The effective mass, energy\nspectrum of the collective excitations, the sound velocity and critical\ntemperature are obtained for different TMDC materials. It is shown that in the\nBogolubov approximation the sound velocity in the two-component dilute exciton\nBose gas is always larger than in any one-component. The difference between the\nsound velocities for two-component and one-component dilute gases is caused by\nthe fact that the sound velocity for two-component system depends on the\nreduced mass of A and B excitons, which is always smaller than the individual\nmass of A or B exciton. Due to this fact, the critical temperature Tc for\nsuperfluidity for the two-component exciton system in TMDC bilayer is about one\norder of magnitude higher than Tc in any one-component exciton system. We\npropose to observe the superfluidity of two-dimensional dipolar excitons in two\nparallel TMDC layers, which causes two opposite superconducting currents in\neach TMDC layer.\n", "  We develop a systematic approach to determine and measure numerically the\ngeometry of generic quantum or \"fuzzy\" geometries realized by a set of\nfinite-dimensional hermitian matrices. The method is designed to recover the\nsemi-classical limit of quantized symplectic spaces embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nincluding the well-known examples of fuzzy spaces, but it applies much more\ngenerally. The central tool is provided by quasi-coherent states, which are\ndefined as ground states of Laplace- or Dirac operators corresponding to\nlocalized point branes in target space. The displacement energy of these\nquasi-coherent states is used to extract the local dimension and tangent space\nof the semi-classical geometry, and provides a measure for the quality and\nself-consistency of the semi-classical approximation. The method is discussed\nand tested with various examples, and implemented in an open-source Mathematica\npackage.\n", "  Quantum walks are a well-established model for the study of coherent\ntransport phenomena and provide a universal platform in quantum information\ntheory. Dynamically influencing the walker's evolution gives a high degree of\nflexibility for studying various applications. Here, we present\ntime-multiplexed finite quantum walks of variable size, the preparation of\nnon-localized input states and their dynamical evolution. As a further\napplication, we implement a state transfer scheme for an arbitrary input state\nto two different output modes. The presented experiments rely on the full\ndynamical control of a time-multiplexed quantum walk, which includes adjustable\ncoin operation as well as the possibility to flexibly configure the underlying\ngraph structures.\n", "  There exist several kinds of sources emitting neutrinos in the MeV energy\nrange. These low-energy neutrinos from different sources can be often detected\nby the same multipurpose detectors. The status-of-art of the feld of solar\nneutrinos, geoneutrinos, and the search for sterile neutrino with artifcial\nneutrino sources is provided here; other neutrino sources, as for example\nreactor or high-energy neutrinos, are described elsewhere. For each of these\nthree felds, the present-day motivation and open questions, as well as the\nlatest experimental results and future perspectives are discussed.\n", "  Boron implantation with in-situ dynamic annealing is used to produce highly\nconductive sub-surface layers in type IIa (100) diamond plates for the search\nof a superconducting phase transition. Here we demonstrate that high-fluence\nMeV ion-implantation, at elevated temperatures avoids graphitization and can be\nused to achieve doping densities of 6 at.%. In order to quantify the diamond\ncrystal damage associated with implantation Raman spectroscopy was performed,\ndemonstrating high temperature annealing recovers the lattice. Additionally,\nlow-temperature electronic transport measurements show evidence of charge\ncarrier densities close to the metal-insulator-transition. After electronic\ncharacterization, secondary ion mass spectrometry was performed to map out the\nion profile of the implanted plates. The analysis shows close agreement with\nthe simulated ion-profile assuming scaling factors that take into account an\naverage change in diamond density due to device fabrication. Finally, the data\nshow that boron diffusion is negligible during the high temperature annealing\nprocess.\n", "  We discuss the Kondo effect for isospin-exchange interaction between a\n$\\bar{D}$, $B$ meson and a valence nucleon in charm/bottom atomic nuclei\nincluding the discrete energy-levels for valence nucleons. To investigate the\nbinding energy by the Kondo effect, we introduce the mean-field approach for\nthe bound state of the $\\bar{D}$, $B$ meson in charm/bottom nuclei. Assuming a\nsimple model, we examine the validity of the mean-field approximation by\ncomparing the results with the exact solutions. We also estimate the effect of\nthe quantum fluctuation beyond the mean-field approximation. We discuss the\ncompetition between the Kondo effect and the other correlations in valence\nnucleon, the isospin symmetry breaking and the nucleon pairings.\n", "  We discovered a near room temperature lead-free relaxor-ferroelectric\n(Ba0.6Bi0.2Li0.2)TiO3 (BBLT) having A-site compositional disordered ABO3\nperovskite structure. Microstructure-property relations revealed that the\nchemical inhomogeneities and development of local polar nano regions (PNRs) are\nresponsible for dielectric dispersion as a function of probe frequencies and\ntemperatures. Rietveld analysis indicates mixed crystal structure with 80%\ntetragonal structure (space group P4mm) and 20% orthorhombic structure (space\ngroup Amm2) which is confirmed by the high resolution transmission electron\ndiffraction pattern. Dielectric constant and tangent loss dispersion with and\nwithout illumination of light obey nonlinear Vogel-Fulture relation. It shows\nslim polarization-hysteresis (P-E) loops and excellent displacement\ncoefficients (d33 ~ 233 pm/V) near room temperature, which gradually diminish\nnear the maximum dielectric dispersion temperature (Tm). The underlying physics\nfor light-sensitive dielectric dispersion was probed by X-ray photon\nspectroscopy (XPS) which strongly suggests that mixed valence of bismuth ions,\nespecially Bi5+ ions, are responsible for most of the optically active centers.\nUltraviolet photoemission measurements showed most of the Ti ions are in 4+\nstates and sit at the centers of the TiO6 octahedra, which along with\nasymmetric hybridization between O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals appears to be the main\ndriving force for net polarization. This BBLT material may open a new path for\nenvironmental friendly lead-free relaxor-ferroelectric research.\n", "  It is revealed that a special kind of Poisson stable point, which we call an\nunpredictable point, gives rise to the existence of chaos in the quasi-minimal\nset. The existing definitions of chaos are formulated in sets of motions. This\nis the first time that description of chaos is initiated from a single motion.\nThe theoretical results are exemplified by means of the symbolic dynamics.\n", "  A closed expression is derived for the probability distribution of the\ntransfer matrix of a particle moving in a one-dimensional system with\ndelta-correlated, weak disorder. The change in the distribution as a function\nof wire length is described by a diffusion equation on the $SU(1,1)$ group,\nwhich is solved through the decomposition of the regular representation into\nirreducible components. The expression generalizes a number of well-known\nresults, including the distributions of the transmission coefficient and local\ndensity of states. As an application, the average single energy-level\ncontribution to the persistent current in a flux-threaded ring is derived.\n", "  We describe recent developments in measuring both signal and noise in phased\narray feeds for radio astronomy at CSIRO. We introduce new techniques including\naperture array noise measurements with beamforming weights matched to a\nreflector's focal field. Weights are calculated via antenna-range and\nin-reflector measurements. We also describe the separation of system\ntemperature and aperture efficiency via drift scans.\n", "  Novel \"smectic-P\" behavior, in which self-propelled particles form rows and\nmove on average along them, occurs generically within the\norientationally-ordered phase of simple models that we simulate. Both apolar\n(head-tail symmetric) and polar (head-tail asymmetric) models with aligning and\nrepulsive interactions exhibit slow algebraic decay of smectic order with\nsystem size up to some finite length scale, after which faster decay occurs. In\nthe apolar case, this scale is that of an undulation instability of the rows.\nIn the polar case, this instability is absent, but traveling fluctuations\ndisrupt the rows in large systems and motion and smectic order may\nspontaneously globally rotate. These observations agree with a new hydrodynamic\ntheory which we present here. Variants of our models also exhibit active\nsmectic \"A\" and \"C\" order, with motion orthogonal and oblique to the layers\nrespectively.\n", "  Neutrino oscillation models involving extra mass eigenstates beyond the\nstandard three (3+N) are fit to global short baseline experimental data. We\nfind that 3+1 has a best fit of Delta m^2_41 = 1.75 eV^2 with a Delta chi^2\n[null-min] (dof) of 52.34 (3). The 3+2 fit has a Delta chi^2 [null-min] (dof)\nof 56.99 (7). Bayesian credible intervals are shown for the first time for a\n3+1 model. These are found to be in agreement with frequentist intervals. The\nresults of these new fits favor a higher Delta m^2 value than previous studies,\nwhich may have an impact on future sterile neutrino searches such as the\nFermilab SBN program.\n", "  Motivated by questions about the open-system dynamics of topological quantum\nmatter, we investigated the quantum Brownian motion of an electron in a\nhomogeneous magnetic field. When the Fermi length\n$l_F=\\hbar/(v_Fm_{\\text{eff}})$ becomes much longer than the magnetic length\n$l_B=(\\hbar c/eB)^{1/2}$, then the spatial coordinates $X,Y$ of the electron\ncease to commute, $[X,Y]=il_B^2$. As a consequence, localization of the\nelectron becomes limited by Heisenberg uncertainty, and the linear\nbath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic\nenergy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron\nhas no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection\nbetween frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features\nmake quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime $l_F\\gg l_B$, which is\nat the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum\nBrownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation\nderived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of\ncharacterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out\nto be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to\n$t^\\alpha$ and $\\alpha=1$, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality\nconstant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and\ninversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime,\nfriction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We\nalso show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the\nnoncommutative plane for suitably designed metastable potential wells, a\nfeature that might be worth exploiting for storage and protection of quantum\ninformation.\n", "  We investigate the ground state density distributions of anti-ferromagnetic\nspin-1 Bose gases in one dimensional harmonic potential in the full interacting\nregimes. The ground state is obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in the\nHilbert space composed of the lowest eigenstates of noninteracting Bose gas and\nspin components. The study reveals that in the situation of weak spin-dependent\ninteraction the total density profiles evolve from Gaussian-like distribution\nto a Fermi-like shell structure of $N$ peaks with the increasing of\nspin-independent interaction. While the increasing spin-exchange interaction\nalways weaken the fermionization of density distribution such that the total\ndensity profiles show shell structure of less peaks and even show single peak\nstructure in the limit of strong spin-exchange interaction. The weakening of\nfermionization results from the formation of composite atoms induced by\nspin-exchange interaction. It is also shown that phase separation occurs for\nthe spinor Bose gas with weak spin-exchange interaction, meanwhile strong\nspin-independent interaction.\n", "  The historical discovery of neutrino oscillations using solar and atmospheric\nneutrinos, and subsequent accelerator and reactor studies, has brought neutrino\nphysics to the precision era. We note that CP effects in oscillation phenomena\ncould be difficult to extract in the presence of unitarity violation. As a\nresult upcoming dedicated leptonic CP violation studies should take into\naccount the non-unitarity of the lepton mixing matrix. Restricting\nnon-unitarity will shed light on the seesaw scale, and thereby guide us towards\nthe new physics responsible for neutrino mass generation.\n", "  The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) was introduced by the austrian physicist\nWolfgang Pauli in 1925. Since then, several experiments have checked its\nvalidity. From 2006 until 2010, the VIP (VIolation of the Pauli Principle)\nexperiment took data at the LNGS underground laboratory to test the PEP. This\nexperiment looked for electronic 2p to 1s transitions in copper, where 2\nelectrons are in the 1s state before the transition happens. These transitions\nviolate the PEP. The lack of detection of X-ray photons coming from these\ntransitions resulted in a preliminary upper limit for the violation of the PEP\nof $4.7 \\times 10^{-29}$. Currently, the successor experiment VIP2 is under\npreparation. The main improvements are, on one side, the use of Silicon Drift\nDetectors (SDDs) as X-ray photon detectors. On the other side an active\nshielding is implemented, which consists of plastic scintillator bars read by\nSilicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The employment of these detectors will\nimprove the upper limit for the violation of the PEP by around 2 orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  We present scientific results obtained with a recently commissioned\n\\'{e}chelle spectrograph on the 0.5-m Solaris-1 telescope in the South African\nAstronomical Observatory. BACHES is a low-cost slit \\'{e}chelle spectrograph\nthat has a resolution of 21,000 at 5,500 \\AA. The described setup is fully\nremotely operated and partly automated. Custom hardware components have been\ndesigned to allow both spectroscopic and photometric observations. The setup is\ncontrolled via dedicated software. The throughput of the system allows us to\nobtain spectra with an average SNR of 22 at 6375 {\\AA} for a 30-min exposure of\na $V=10$ mag target. The stability of the instrument is influenced mainly by\nthe ambient temperature changes. We have obtained radial velocity RMS values\nfor a bright (V = 5.9 mag) spectroscopic binary as good as 0.59 km s$^{-1}$ and\n1.34 km s$^{-1}$ for a $V = 10.2$ mag eclipsing binary. Radial velocity\nmeasurements have been combined with available photometric light curves. We\npresent models of six eclipsing binary systems, and for previously known\ntargets, we compare our results with those available in the literature. Masses\nof binary components have been determined with 3% errors for some targets. We\nconfront our results with benchmark values based on measurements from the HARPS\nand UCLES spectrographs on 4-m class telescopes and find very good agreement.\nThe described setup is very efficient and well suited for a spectroscopic\nsurvey. We can now spectroscopically characterize about 300 eclipsing binary\nstars per year up to 10.2 mag assuming typical weather conditions at SAAO\nwithout a single observing trip.\n", "  We consider self-avoiding walks terminally attached to an impenetrable\nsurface at which they can adsorb. We call the vertices farthest away from this\nplane the top vertices and we consider applying a force at the plane containing\nthe top vertices. This force can be directed away from the adsorbing surface or\ntowards it. In both cases we prove that the free energy (in the thermodynamic\nlimit) is identical to the free energy when the force is applied at the last\nvertex. This means that the criterion determining the critical force -\ntemperature curve is identical for the two ways in which the force is applied\nand the response to pushing the walk is also the same in the two cases.\n", "  We report the generation of a pseudovector electric current having imbalanced\nchirality in an electron-positron strongly magnetized gas in QED. It propagates\nalong the external applied magnetic field B as a chiral magnetic effect in QED.\nIt is triggered by a perturbative electric field parallel to B, associated to a\npseudovector longitudinal mode propagating along B. An electromagnetic chemical\npotential was introduced, but our results remain valid even for vanishing\nchemical potential. A nonzero fermion mass was assumed, which is usually\nconsidered vanishing in the literature. In the quantum field theory formalism\nat finite temperature and density, an anomaly relation for the axial current\nwas found for a medium of massive fermions. It bears some analogy to the\nAdler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly. From the expression for the chiral current in terms\nof the photon self-energy tensor in a medium, it is obtained that electrons and\npositrons scattered by longitudinal photons (inside the light cone) contribute\nto the chiral current, as well as the pair creation due to longitudinal photons\n(out of light cone). In the static limit, an electric pseudovector current is\nobtained in the lowest Landau level\n", "  We present a bidirectional modification of the standard one-qubit\nteleportation protocol, where both Alice and Bob transfer noisy versions of\ntheir qubit states to each other by using single Bell state and auxiliary\n(trigger) qubits. Three schemes are considered: the first where the actions of\nparties are governed by two independent quantum random triggers, the second\nwith single random trigger, and the third as a mixture of the first two. We\ncalculate the fidelities of teleportation for all schemes and find a condition\non correlation between trigger qubits in the mixed scheme which allows us to\novercome the classical fidelity boundary of 2/3. We apply the Choi-Jamiolkowski\nisomorphism to the quantum channels obtained in order to investigate an\ninterplay between their ability to transfer the information,\nentanglement-breaking property, and auxiliary classical communication needed to\nform correlations between trigger qubits. The suggested scheme for\nbidirectional teleportation can be realized by using current experimental\ntools.\n", "  In this contribution we describe the current understanding of reactor\nantineutrino fluxes and point out some recent developments. This is not\nintended to be a complete review of this vast topic but merely a selection of\nobservations and remarks, which despite their incompleteness, will highlight\nthe status and the challenges of this field.\n", "  We present a promising method for creating high-density ensembles of\nnitrogen-vacancy centers with narrow spin-resonances for high-sensitivity\nmagnetic imaging. Practically, narrow spin-resonance linewidths substantially\nreduce the optical and RF power requirements for ensemble-based sensing. The\nmethod combines isotope purified diamond growth, in situ nitrogen doping, and\nhelium ion implantation to realize a 100 nm-thick sensing surface. The obtained\n10^(17) cm^(-3) nitrogen-vacancy density is only a factor of 10 less than the\nhighest densities reported to date, with an observed spin resonance linewidth\nover 10 times more narrow. The 200 kHz linewidth is most likely limited by\ndipolar broadening indicating even further reduction of the linewidth is\ndesirable and possible.\n", "  We study the effect of thermal charm production on charmonium regeneration in\nhigh energy nuclear collisions. By solving the kinetic equations for charm\nquark and charmonium distributions in Pb+Pb collisions, we calculate the global\nand differential nuclear modification factors $R_{AA}(N_{part})$ and\n$R{AA}(p_t)$ for $J/\\Psi$s. Due to the thermal charm production in hot medium,\nthe charmonium production source changes from the initially created charm\nquarks at SPS, RHIC and LHC to the thermally produced charm quarks at Future\nCircular Collider (FCC), and the $J/\\Psi$ suppression ($R_{AA}<1$) observed so\nfar will be replaced by a strong enhancement ($R_{AA}>1$) at FCC at low\ntransverse momentum.\n", "  We introduce a simple model to describe the interplay between specific and\nnon-specific interactions. We study the influence of various physical factors\non the static and dynamic properties of the specific interactions of our model\nand show that contrary to intuitive expectations, non-specific interactions can\nassist in the formation of specific complexes and increase their stability. We\nthen discuss the relevance of these results for biological systems.\n", "  New classes two-dimensional (2D) materials beyond graphene, including layered\nand non-layered, and their heterostructures, are currently attracting\nincreasing interest due to their promising applications in nanoelectronics,\noptoelectronics and clean energy, where thermal transport property is one of\nthe fundamental physical parameters. In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigated the phonon transport properties of 2D orthorhombic group IV-VI\ncompounds of $GeS$, $GeSe$, $SnS$ and $SnSe$ by solving the Boltzmann transport\nequation (BTE) based on first-principles calculations. Despite the similar\npuckered (hinge-like) structure along the armchair direction as phosphorene,\nthe four monolayer compounds possess diverse anisotropic properties in many\naspects, such as phonon group velocity, Young's modulus and lattice thermal\nconductivity ($\\kappa$), etc. Especially, the $\\kappa$ along the zigzag and\narmchair directions of monolayer $GeS$ shows the strongest anisotropy while\nmonolayer $SnS$ and $SnSe$ shows an almost isotropy in phonon transport. The\norigin of the diverse anisotropy is fully studied and the underlying mechanism\nis discussed in detail. With limited size, the $\\kappa$ could be effectively\nlowered, and the anisotropy could be effectively modulated by nanostructuring,\nwhich would extend the applications in nanoscale thermoelectrics and thermal\nmanagement. Our study offers fundamental understanding of the anisotropic\nphonon transport properties of 2D materials, and would be of significance for\nfurther study, modulation and aplications in emerging technologies.\n", "  A geometric view of the polarimetric properties of a nondepolarizing medium\nis presented by means of a pair of vectors in the Poincar\\'e sphere. An\nalternative representation constituted by a set of vectors contained in the\nequatorial plane of the Poincar\\'e sphere is also defined and interpreted. The\nanalyses of the magnitudes and relative orientations of the constitutive\nvectors of such simple representations allow for a classification of\nnondepolarizing media.\n", "  Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) in the early Universe are predicted to\nleave an as yet undetected signature on the relative clustering of total mass\nversus luminous matter. A detection of this effect would provide an important\nconfirmation of the standard cosmological paradigm and constrain alternatives\nto dark matter as well as non-standard fluctuations such as Compensated\nIsocurvature Perturbations (CIPs). We conduct the first observational search\nfor this effect, by comparing the number-weighted and luminosity-weighted\ncorrelation functions, using the SDSS-III BOSS Data Release 10 CMASS sample.\nWhen including CIPs in our model, we formally obtain evidence at $3.2\\sigma$ of\nthe relative clustering signature and a limit that matches the existing upper\nlimits on the amplitude of CIPs. However, various tests suggest that these\nresults are not yet robust, perhaps due to systematic biases in the data. The\nmethod developed in this Letter, used with more accurate future data such as\nthat from DESI, is likely to confirm or disprove our preliminary evidence.\n", "  We establish a stochastic thermodynamics for a Fermionic level driven by a\ntime-dependent force and interacting with initially thermalized levels playing\nthe role of a reservoir. The driving induces consecutive avoided crossings\nbetween system and reservoir levels described within Landau-Zener theory. We\nderive the resulting system dynamics and thermodynamics and identify energy,\nwork, heat, entropy and dissipation. Our theory perfectly reproduces the\nnumerically exact quantum work statistics obtained using a two point\nmeasurements approach of the total energy and provides an explicit expression\nfor the dissipation in terms of diabatic transitions.\n", "  Recently, a static gravitational field, such as that of the Earth, was\nproposed as a new source of decoherence [1]. We study the conditions under\nwhich it becomes the dominant decoherence effect in typical interferometric\nexperiments. The following competing sources are considered: spontaneous\nemission of light, absorption, scattering with the thermal photons and\ncollisions with the residual gas. We quantify all these effects. As we will\nsee, current experiments are off by several orders of magnitude. New ideas are\nneeded in order to achieve the necessary requirements: having as large as\nsystem as possible, to increase gravitational decoherence, cool it and isolated\nwell enough to reduce thermal and collisional decoherence, and resolve very\nsmall distances.\n", "  We discuss the Yukawa couplings in 6D gauge-Higgs unification models on\n$T^2/Z_N$ in the presence of magnetic fluxes. We provide general formulae for\nthem, and numerically evaluate their magnitude in a specific model on\n$T^2/Z_3$. Thanks to the nontrivial profiles of the zero-mode wave functions,\nthe top quark Yukawa coupling can be reproduced without introducing a large\nrepresentation of the gauge group for matter fields. However, it is difficult\nto realize small Yukawa couplings only by the magnetic fluxes and the\nWilson-line phases because of the complicated structure of the mode functions\non $T^2/Z_N$ ($N=3,4,6$).\n", "  We study matter-coupled $N=3$ gauged supergravity in four dimensions with\nvarious semisimple gauge groups. When coupled to $n$ vector multiplets, the\ngauged supergravity contains $3+n$ vector fields and $3n$ complex scalars\nparametrized by $SU(3,n)/SU(3)\\times SU(n)\\times U(1)$ coset manifold.\nSemisimple gauge groups take the form of $G_0\\times H\\subset SO(3,n)\\subset\nSU(3,n)$ with $H$ being a compact subgroup of $SO(n+3-\\textrm{dim}(G_0))$. The\n$G_0$ groups considered in this paper are of the form $SO(3)$, $SO(3,1)$,\n$SO(2,2)$, $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ and $SO(2,1)\\times SO(2,2)$. We find that\n$SO(3)\\times SO(3)$, $SO(3,1)$ and $SL(3,\\mathbb{R})$ gauge groups admit a\nmaximally supersymmetric $AdS_4$ critical point. The $SO(2,1)\\times SO(2,2)$\ngauge group admits a supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum while the remaining gauge\ngroups admit both half-supersymmetric domain wall vacua and $AdS_4$ vacua with\ncompletely broken supersymmetry. For the $SO(3)\\times SO(3)$ gauge group, there\nexists another supersymmetric $N=3$ $AdS_4$ critical point with\n$SO(3)_{\\textrm{diag}}$ symmetry. We explicitly give a detailed study of\nvarious holographic RG flows between $AdS_4$ critical points, flows to\nnon-conformal theories and supersymmetric domain walls in each gauge group. The\nresults provide gravity duals of $N=3$ Chern-Simons-Matter theories in three\ndimensions.\n", "  Most social network analyses focus on online social networks. While these\nnetworks encode important aspects of our lives they fail to capture many\nreal-world connections. Most of these connections are, in fact, public and\nknown to the members of the community. Mapping them is a task very suitable for\ncrowdsourcing: it is easily broken down in many simple and independent\nsubtasks. Due to the nature of social networks -- presence of highly connected\nnodes and tightly knit groups -- if we allow users to map their immediate\nconnections and the connections between them, we will need few participants to\nmap most connections within a community. To this end, we built the Human Atlas,\na web-based tool for mapping social networks. To test it, we partially mapped\nthe social network of the MIT Media Lab. We ran a user study and invited\nmembers of the community to use the tool. In 4.6 man-hours, 22 participants\nmapped 984 connections within the lab, demonstrating the potential of the tool.\n", "  The China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) is a new facility for\nconducting low event-rate experiments. We present an overview of CJPL and the\nCDEX Dark Matter program based on germanium detectors with sub-keV\nsensitivities. The achieved results, status as well as the R&D and technology\nacquisition efforts towards a ton-scale experiment are reported.\n", "  The correlation function is an important quantity in the physics of ultracold\nquantum gases because it provides information about the quantum many-body wave\nfunction beyond the simple density profile. In this paper we first study the\n$M$-body local correlation functions, $g_M$, of the one-dimensional (1D)\nstrongly repulsive Bose gas within the Lieb-Liniger model using the analytical\nmethod proposed by Gangardt and Shlyapnikov [1,2]. In the strong repulsion\nregime the 1D Bose gas at low temperatures is equivalent to a gas of ideal\nparticles obeying the non-mutual generalized exclusion statistics (GES) with a\nstatistical parameter $\\alpha =1-2/\\gamma$, i.e. the quasimomenta of $N$\nstrongly interacting bosons map to the momenta of $N$ free fermions via\n$k_i\\approx \\alpha k_i^F $ with $i=1,\\ldots, N$. Here $\\gamma$ is the\ndimensionless interaction strength within the Lieb-Liniger model. We rigorously\nprove that such a statistical parameter $\\alpha$ solely determines the\nsub-leading order contribution to the $M$-body local correlation function of\nthe gas at strong but finite interaction strengths. We explicitly calculate the\ncorrelation functions $g_M$ in terms of $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ at zero, low, and\nintermediate temperatures. For $M=2$ and $3$ our results reproduce the known\nexpressions for $g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ with sub-leading terms (see for instance\n[3-5]). We also express the leading order of the short distance\n\\emph{non-local} correlation functions\n$\\langle\\Psi^\\dagger(x_1)\\cdots\\Psi^\\dagger(x_M)\\Psi(y_M)\\cdots\\Psi(y_1)\\rangle$\nof the strongly repulsive Bose gas in terms of the wave function of $M$ bosons\nat zero collision energy and zero total momentum. Here $\\Psi(x)$ is the boson\nannihilation operator. These general formulas of the higher-order local and\nnon-local correlation functions of the 1D Bose gas provide new insights into\nthe many-body physics.\n", "  Cross-section, vector-polarization, and tensor-polarization distributions are\ncalculated for the reactions $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow \\bar{p}p$ and $e^+ e^-\n\\rightarrow \\bar{\\Lambda} \\Lambda$. Each reaction requires six characteristic\nfunctions that are bilinear in the, possibly complex, electromagnetic form\nfactors, denoted $G_E(P^2)$ and $G_M(P^2)$, of $p$ and $\\Lambda$. For the\nhyperon reaction also the joint-decay distributions of $\\Lambda$ and\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}$ are calculated. Their knowledge allow a complete determination\nof the hyperon electromagnetic form factors, without measuring hyperon spins.\nWe explain how this is done in practice. For some tensor-polarization\ncomponents our results are in conflict with previously repeatedly published\ndistributions.\n", "  We derive an exact formula for the stochastic evolution of the characteristic\ndeterminant of a class of deformed Wishart matrices following from a chiral\nrandom matrix model of QCD at finite chemical potential. In the WKB\napproximation, the characteristic determinant describes a sharp droplet of\neigenvalues that deforms and expands at large stochastic times. Beyond the WKB\nlimit, the edges of the droplet are fuzzy and described by universal edge\nfunctions. At the chiral point, the characteristic determinant in the\nmicroscopic limit is universal. Remarkably, the physical chiral condensate at\nfinite chemical potential may be extracted from current and quenched lattice\nDirac spectra using the universal edge scaling laws, without having to solve\nthe QCD sign problem.\n", "  We describe a tool we improved to detect excess noise in the gravitational\nwave (GW) channel arising from its bilinear or nonlinear coupling with\nfluctuations of various components of a GW interferometer and its environment.\nWe also describe a higher-order statistics tool we developed to characterize\nthese couplings, e.g., by unraveling the frequencies of the fluctuations\ncontributing to such noise, and demonstrate its utility by applying it to\nunderstand nonlinear couplings in Advanced LIGO engineering data. Once such\nnoise is detected, it is highly desirable to remove it or correct for it. Such\naction in the past has been shown to improve the sensitivity of the instrument\nin searches of astrophysical signals. If this is not possible, then steps must\nbe taken to mitigate its influence, e.g., by characterizing its effect on\nastrophysical searches. We illustrate this through a study of the effect of\ntransient sine-Gaussian noise artifacts on a compact binary coalescence\ntemplate bank.\n", "  Q0 determinations based on RF power measurements are subject to at least\nthree potentially large systematic effects that have not been previously\nappreciated. Instrumental factors that can systematically bias RF based\nmeasurements of Q0 are quantified and steps that can be taken to improve the\ndetermination of Q0 are discussed.\n", "  We study symmetric simple exclusion processes (SSEP) on a ring in the\npresence of uniformly moving multiple defects or disorders - a generalization\nof the model proposed earlier [Phys. Rev. E 89, 022138 (2014)]. The defects\nmove with uniform velocity and change the particle hopping rates locally. We\nexplore the collective effects of the defects on the spatial structure and\ntransport properties of the system. We also introduce an SSEP with ordered\nsequential (sitewise) update and elucidate the close connection with our model.\n", "  Neutrino flavor evolution in core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers,\nor the early universe is dominated by neutrino-neutrino refraction, often\nspawning \"self-induced flavor conversion\", i.e., shuffling of flavor among\nmomentum modes. This effect is driven by collective run-away modes of the\ncoupled \"flavor oscillators\" and can spontaneously break the initial symmetries\nsuch as axial symmetry, homogeneity, isotropy, and even stationarity. Moreover,\nthe growth rates of unstable modes can be of the order of the neutrino-neutrino\ninteraction energy instead of the much smaller vacuum oscillation frequency:\nself-induced flavor conversion does not always require neutrino masses. We\nillustrate these newly found phenomena in terms of simple toy models. What\nhappens in realistic astrophysical settings is up to speculation at present.\n", "  Higher-order anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions are affected by\nnonlinear mode coupling effects. It has been suggested that the associated\nnonlinear hydrodynamic response coefficients probe the transport properties and\nare largely insensitive to the spectrum of initial density fluctuations of the\nmedium created in these collisions. To test this suggestion, we explore\nnonlinear mode coupling effects in event-by-event viscous fluid dynamics, using\ntwo different models for the fluctuating initial density profiles, and compare\nthe nonlinear coupling coefficients between the initial eccentricity vectors\nbefore hydrodynamic expansion and the final flow vectors after the expansion.\nFor several mode coupling coefficients we find significant sensitivity to the\ninitial fluctuation spectrum. They all exhibit strong sensitivity to the\nspecific shear viscosity at freeze-out, but only weak dependence on the shear\nviscosity during hydrodynamic evolution.\n", "  We discuss an anthropic explanation of why there exist three generations of\nfermions. If one assumes that the right-handed neutrino sector is responsible\nfor both the matter-antimatter asymmetry and the dark matter, then anthropic\nselection favors three or more families of fermions. For successful\nleptogenesis, at least two right-handed neutrinos are needed, while the third\nright-handed neutrino is invoked to play the role of dark matter. The number of\nthe right-handed neutrinos is tied to the number of generations by the anomaly\nconstraints of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry. Combining anthropic arguments\nwith observational constraints, we obtain predictions for the $X$-ray\nobservations, as well as for neutrinoless double-beta decay.\n", "  We study the time evolution of an integrable many-particle system, described\nby the $q$-boson Hamiltonian in the limit of strong interactions $q\\to\\infty$.\nIt is shown that, for a particular class of pure initial states, the analytical\ncalculation of certain observables simplifies considerably. Namely, we provide\nexact formulas for the calculation of the Loschmidt-echo and the emptiness\nformation probability, where the computational time scales polynomially with\nthe particle number. Moreover, we construct a non-local mapping of the\n$q$-boson model to the XX spin chain, and show how this can be utilized to\nobtain the time evolution of various local bosonic observables for\ntranslationally invariant initial states. The results obtained via the bosonic\nand fermionic picture show perfect agreement. In the infinite volume and large\ntime limits, we rigorously verify the prediction of the Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble for homogeneous initial Fock states.\n", "  We present a new automated method to identify instrumental features\nmasquerading as small, long period planets in the \\kepler\\ planet candidate\ncatalog. These systematics, mistakenly identified as planet transits, can have\na strong impact on occurrence rate calculations because they cluster in a\nregion of parameter space where Kepler's sensitivity to planets is poor. We\ncompare individual transit-like events to a variety of models of real transits\nand systematic events, and use a Bayesian Information Criterion to evaluate the\nlikelihood that each event is real. We describe our technique and test its\nperformance on simulated data. Results from this technique are incorporated in\nthe \\kepler\\ Q1-17 DR24 planet candidate catalog of \\citet{Coughlin15}.\n", "  [Background] The \"pasta\" phase of nuclear matter may play an important role\nin the structure and evolution of neutron stars. Recent works suggest nuclear\npasta has a high resistivity which could be explained by the presence of long\nlived topological defects. The defects act as impurities that decrease thermal\nand electrical conductivity of the pasta. [Purpose] To quantify how topological\ndefects affect transport properties of nuclear pasta and estimate this effect\nusing an impurity parameter $Q_{\\text{imp}}$. [Methods] Contrast molecular\ndynamics simulations of up to 409\\,600 nucleons arranged in parallel nuclear\npasta slabs (perfect pasta) with simulations of pasta slabs connected by\ntopological defects (impure pasta). From these simulations compare the\nviscosity and heat conductivity of perfect and impure pasta to obtain an\neffective impurity parameter $Q_{\\text{imp}}$ due to the presence of defects.\n[Results] Both the viscosity and thermal conductivity calculated for both\nperfect and impure pasta are anisotropic, peaking along directions\nperpendicular to the slabs and reaching a minimum close to zero parallel to\nthem. In our 409\\,600 nucleon simulation topological defects connecting slabs\nof pasta reduce both the thermal conductivity and viscosity on average by about\n37\\%. We estimate an effective impurity parameter due to the defects of order\n$Q_{\\text{imp}}\\sim30$. [Conclusions] Topological defects in the pasta phase of\nnuclear matter have an effect similar to impurities in a crystal lattice. The\nirregularities introduced by the defects reduce the thermal and electrical\nconductivities and the viscosity of the system. This effect can be\nparameterized by a large impurity parameter $Q_{\\text{imp}}\\sim30$.\n", "  It is known that when strong electric field is applied to a semiconductor\nsample, the current voltage characteristic deviates from the linear response.\nIn this letter, we propose a new point of view of nonlinearity in\nsemiconductors which is associated with the electron temperature dependence on\nthe recombination rate. The heating of the charge carriers breaks the balance\nbetween generation and recombination, giving rise to nonequilibrium charge\ncarriers concentration and nonlinearity.\n", "  We extend the concept of radially and azimuthally polarized optical beams to\nthe polychromatic domain by introducing cylindrically polarized nondiffracting\noptical pulses. In particular, we discuss in detail the case of cylindrically\npolarized X-waves, both in the paraxial and nonparaxial regime. The explicit\nexpressions for the electric and magnetic fields of cylindrically polarized\nX-waves is also reported.\n", "  A distorted black hole radiates gravitational waves in order to settle down\nin a smoother geometry. During that relaxation phase, a characteristic damped\nringing is generated. It can be theoretically constructed from both the black\nhole quasinormal frequencies (which govern its oscillating behavior and its\ndecay) and the associated excitation factors (which determine intrinsically its\namplitude) by carefully taking into account the source of the distortion. In\nthe framework of massive gravity, the excitation factors of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole have an unexpected strong resonant behavior which, theoretically,\ncould lead to giant and slowly decaying ringings. If massive gravity is\nrelevant to physics, one can hope to observe these extraordinary ringings by\nusing the next generations of gravitational wave detectors. Indeed, they could\nbe generated by supermassive black holes if the graviton mass is not too small.\nIn fact, by focusing on the odd-parity $\\ell=1$ mode of the Fierz-Pauli field,\nwe shall show here that such ringings are neutralized in waveforms due to (i)\nthe excitation of the quasibound states of the black hole and (ii) the\nevanescent nature of the particular partial modes which could excite the\nconcerned quasinormal modes. Despite this, with observational consequences in\nmind, it is interesting to note that the waveform amplitude is nevertheless\nrather pronounced and slowly decaying (this effect is now due to the long-lived\nquasibound states). It is worth noting also that, for very low values of the\ngraviton mass (corresponding to the weak instability regime for the black\nhole), the waveform is now very clean and dominated by an ordinary ringing\nwhich could be used as a signature of massive gravity.\n", "  We study diffusion on comb lattices of arbitrary dimension. Relying on the\nloopless structure of these lattices and using first-passage properties, we\nobtain exact and explicit formulae for the Laplace transforms of the\npropagators associated to nearest-neighbour random walks in both cases where\neither the first or the last point of the random walk is on the backbone of the\nlattice, and where the two extremities are arbitrarily chosen. As an\napplication, we compute the mean-square displacement of a random walker on a\ncomb of arbitrary dimension. We also propose an alternative and consistent\napproach of the problem using a master equation description, and obtain simple\nand generic expressions of the propagators. This method is more general and is\nextended to study the propagators of random walks on more complex comb-like\nstructures. In particular, we study the case of a two-dimensional comb lattice\nwith teeth of finite length.\n", "  We analyze in detail an open cavity array using mean-field description, where\neach cavity field is coupled to a number of three-level atoms. Such system is\nhighly tunable and can be described by a Jaynes-Cummings like Hamiltonian with\nadditional non-linear terms. In the single cavity case we provide simple\nanalytic solutions and show, that the system features a bistable region. The\nextra non-linear term gives rise to a rich dynamical behaviour including\noccurrence of limit cycles through Hopf bifurcations. In the limit of large\nnon-linearity, the system exhibits an Ising like phase transition as the\ncoupling between light and matter is varied. We then discuss how these results\nextend to the two-dimensional case.\n", "  The evaluation of the numerically dominant pseudoscalar-pole contribution to\nhadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon g-2 involves the\npseudoscalar-photon transition form factor F_{P gamma^* gamma^*}(-Q_1^2,\n-Q_2^2) with P = pi^0, eta, eta^\\prime and, in general, two off-shell photons\nwith spacelike momenta Q_{1,2}^2. We determine which regions of photon momenta\ngive the main contribution for hadronic light-by-light scattering. Furthermore,\nwe analyze how the precision of future measurements of the single- and\ndouble-virtual form factor impacts the precision of a data-driven estimate of\nthis contribution to hadronic light-by-light scattering.\n", "  In this talk, we present the first chiral extrapolation of a resonant\nscattering amplitude obtained from lattice QCD. Finite-volume spectra,\ndetermined by the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration at $m_\\pi = 236$ MeV, for the\nisotriplet $\\pi\\pi$ channel are analyzed using the L\\\"uscher method to\ndetermine the infinite-volume scattering amplitude. Unitarized Chiral\nPerturbation Theory is then used to extrapolate the scattering amplitude to the\nphysical light quark masses. The viability of this procedure is demonstrated by\nits agreement with the experimentally determined scattering phase shift up to\ncenter-of-mass energies of 1.2 GeV. Finally, we analytically continue the\namplitude to the complex plane to obtain the $\\rho$-pole at\n$\\left[755(2)(1)\\left({}^{20}_{02}\\right) - \\frac{i}{2}\n129(3)(1)\\left({}^7_1\\right)\\right]$ MeV.\n", "  On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave\nObservatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient (GW150914); we\ncharacterize the properties of the source and its parameters. The data around\nthe time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using a\nsuite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a\ncompact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearly\nequal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}\nM_\\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the\n90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive\nblack hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distance\nto the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift\n$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location is\nconstrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southern\nhemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and\nspin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive than\nany other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass\nregime.\n", "  On September 14, 2015, a gravitational wave signal from a coalescing black\nhole binary system was observed by the Advanced LIGO detectors. This paper\ndescribes the transient noise backgrounds used to determine the significance of\nthe event (designated GW150914) and presents the results of investigations into\npotential correlated or uncorrelated sources of transient noise in the\ndetectors around the time of the event. The detectors were operating nominally\nat the time of GW150914. We have ruled out environmental influences and\nnon-Gaussian instrument noise at either LIGO detector as the cause of the\nobserved gravitational wave signal.\n", "  The entangled \"Schrodinger's cat state\" of a quantum and its measurement\napparatus is not a paradoxical superposition of states but is instead a\nnon-paradoxical superposition of nonlocal coherent correlations between states:\nAn un-decayed nucleus is correlated with a live cat, and a decayed nucleus is\ncorrelated with a dead cat. This elucidation of entanglement is demonstrated by\nquantum-theoretical analysis and by experiments performed in 1990 using\nentangled photon pairs. Thus the cat state does not predict a dead-and-alive\ncat. Instead of indefinite superpositions, it predicts mixtures of definite\neigenvalues even though the subsystems are not actually in the corresponding\neigenstates, a situation that implies a (trivial) revision of the standard\neigenvalue-eigenstate rule. Because the subsystem states are not mixed even\nthough the subsystem eigenvalues are mixed, this analysis avoids two common\nobjections to such a resolution, namely improper density operators and basis\nambiguity. Thus, entanglement transfers coherence from the superposed quantum\nto correlations between the quantum and its measuring apparatus, permitting\ninstantaneous collapse without interrupting the global unitary evolution. This\nresolves a key part of the measurement problem.\n", "  Almost 50 years after the discovery of gluons & quarks, we are only just\nbeginning to understand how QCD builds the basic bricks for nuclei: neutrons,\nprotons, and the pions that bind them. QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics.\n", "  Simplicial complexes are generalized network structures able to encode\ninteractions occurring between more than two nodes. Simplicial complexes\ndescribe a large variety of complex interacting systems ranging from brain\nnetworks, to social and collaboration networks. Here we characterize the\nstructure of simplicial complexes using their generalized degrees that capture\nfundamental properties of one, two, three or more linked nodes. Moreover we\nintroduce the configuration model and the canonical ensemble of simplicial\ncomplexes, enforcing respectively the sequence of generalized degrees of the\nnodes and the sequence of the expected generalized degrees of the nodes. We\nevaluate the entropy of these ensembles, finding the asymptotic expression for\nthe number of simplicial complexes in the configuration model. We provide the\nalgorithms for the construction of simplicial complexes belonging to the\nconfiguration model and the canonical ensemble of simplicial complexes. We give\nan expression for the structural cutoff of simplicial complexes that for\nsimplicial complexes of dimension $d=1$ reduces to the structural cutoff of\nsimple networks. Finally we provide a numerical analysis of the natural\ncorrelations emerging in the configuration model of simplicial complexes\nwithout structural cutoff.\n", "  A new class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras given a name of Lax operator\nalgebras, and the related unifying approach to finite-dimensional integrable\nsystems with spectral parameter on a Riemann surface, such as Calogero--Moser\nand Hitchin systems, are presented. In particular, our approach includes (the\nnon-twisted) Kac--Moody algebras and integrable systems with rational spectral\nparameter. The presentation is based on the quite simple ideas related to\ngradings of semisimple Lie algebras, and their interaction with the\nRiemann--Roch theorem. The basic properties of the Lax operator algebras, as\nwell as the basic facts of the theory of integrable systems in question, are\ntreated (and proven) from this general point of view, in particular existence\nof commutative hierarchies and their Hamiltonian properties. We conclude with\nan application of the Lax operator algebras to prequantization of\nfinite-dimensional integrable systems.\n", "  We run numerical simulations of strongly confined suspensions of model\nspherical swimmers called \"squirmers\". Because of the confinement, the\nStokeslet dipoles generated by the particles are quickly screened and the\nfar-field flow is dominated by the source dipole for all the different kinds of\nsquirmers. However, we show that the collective behavior of the suspension\nstill depends on the self-propelling mechanism of the swimmers as polar states\ncan only be observed for neutral squirmers. We demonstrate that the near-field\nhydrodynamic interactions play a crucial role in the alignment of the\norientation vectors of spherical particles. Moreover, we point out that the\nenstrophy and the fluid fluctuations of an active suspension also depend on the\nnature of the squirmers.\n", "  The Fermi-LAT data accumulated over 7 years of {\\gamma}-ray observations,\ntogether with the high resolution gas (CO & HI) and the dust opacity maps, are\nused to study the emissivity of {\\gamma}-rays induced by interactions of cosmic\nrays (CRs) with the interstellar medium. Based on the dust opacity templates,\nthe {\\gamma}-ray emissivity was measured for 36 segments of the Galactic plane.\nFurthermore, the {\\gamma}-ray emissivity was evaluated in six Galactocentric\nrings. Both the absolute emissivity and the energy spectra of {\\gamma}-rays\nderived in the interval 0.2-100 GeV show significant variations along the\ngalactic plane. The density of CRs, derived under the assumption that\n{\\gamma}-rays are predominately produced in CR interactions with the\ninterstellar gas, is characterised by a strong radial dependence. In the inner\nGalaxy the CR density substantially exceeds the density in the outer parts of\nthe Galaxy: by a factor of a few at 10 GeV, and by more than an order of\nmagnitude at 1 TeV. Remarkably, the energy distribution of CRs appears to be\nsubstantially harder than the energy spectrum obtained from direct measurements\nof local CRs. At the same time, the flux and the energy spectrum of multi-GeV\nprotons derived from {\\gamma}-ray data in the outskirts of the Galaxy is quite\nclose to the measurements of local CRs.\n", "  The so-called unimodular version of General Relativity is revisited.\nUnimodular gravity is constructed by fixing the determinant of the metric, what\nleads to the trace-free part of the equations instead of the usual Einstein\nfield equations. Then, a cosmological constant naturally arises as an\nintegration constant. While unimodular gravity turns out equivalent to General\nRelativity (GR) at the classical level, it provides important differences at\nthe quantum level. Here we extend the unimodular constraint to some extensions\nof General Relativity that have drawn a lot of attention over the last years,\nas $f(R)$ gravity (or its scalar-tensor picture) and Gauss-Bonnet gravity. The\ncorresponding unimodular version of such theories is constructed as well as the\nconformal transformation that relates the Einstein and Jordan frames for these\nnon-minimally coupled theories. From the classical point of view, the\nunimodular versions of such extensions are completely equivalent to their\noriginals, but an effective cosmological constant arises naturally, what may\nprovide a richer description of the universe evolution. Here we analyze the\ncase of Starobisnky inflation and compared with the original one.\n", "  In the present paper we present ways to modulate the periodic transmission\npeaks arising in disordered one dimensional photonic structures with hundreds\nof layers. Disordered structures in which the optical length nd (n is the\nrefractive index and d the layer thickness) is the same for each layer show\nregular peaks in their transmission spectra. A proper variation of the optical\nlength of the layers leads to a splitting of the transmission peaks. Notably,\nthe variation of the occurrence of high and low refractive index layers, gives\na tool to tune also the width of the peaks. These results are of highest\ninterest for optical application, such as light filtering, where the manifold\nof parameters allows a precise design of the spectral transmission ranges.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that the excess observed in the leptonic-$Z\n+$jets $+\\slashed{E}_T$ ATLAS SUSY search is due to pair productions of a\nvector-like quark $U$ decaying to the first-generation quarks and $Z$ boson. We\nfind that the excess can be explained within the 2$\\sigma$ (up to 1.4$\\sigma$)\nlevel while evading the constraints from the other LHC searches. The preferred\nrange of the mass and branching ratio are $610 < m_{U} < 760$ GeV and ${\\rm\nBr}(U \\rightarrow Z q) > 0.3$-$0.45$, respectively.\n", "  Local events are characterized by \"where\", \"when\" and \"what\". Just as\n(bosonic) spacetime forms the backdrop for location and time, (fermionic)\nproperty space can serve as the backdrop for the attributes of a system. With\nsuch a scenario I shall describe a scheme that is capable of unifying\ngravitation and the other forces of nature. The generalized metric contains the\ncurvature of spacetime and property separately, with the gauge fields linking\nthe bosonic and fermionic arenas. The super-Ricci scalar can then automatically\nyield the spacetime Lagrangian of gravitation and the standard model (plus a\ncosmological constant) upon integration over property coordinates.\n", "  We study the propagation of a hole in degenerate (paramagnetic) spin\nenvironments. This canonical problem has important connections to a number of\nphysical systems, and is perfectly suited for experimental realization with\nultra-cold atoms in an optical lattice. At the short-to-intermediate timescale\nthat we can access using a stochastic-series-type numeric scheme, the\npropagation turns out to be distinctly non-diffusive with the proba- bility\ndistribution featuring minima in both space and time due to quantum\ninterference, yet the motion is not ballistic, except at the beginning. We\ndiscuss possible scenarios for long-term evolution that could be explored with\nan unprecedented degree of detail in experiments with single-atom resolved\nimaging.\n", "  We present a simple and general formalism to compute efficiently the\nderivatives of a multi-determinant Jastrow-Slater wave function, the local\nenergy, the interatomic forces, and similar quantities needed in quantum Monte\nCarlo. Through a straightforward manipulation of matrices evaluated on the\noccupied and virtual orbitals, we obtain an efficiency equivalent to\nalgorithmic differentiation in the computation of the interatomic forces and\nthe optimization of the orbital paramaters. Furthermore, for a large\nmulti-determinant expansion, the significant computational gain recently\nreported for the calculation of the wave function is here improved and extended\nto all local properties in both all-electron and pseudopotential calculations.\n", "  We analyze velocity-jump process models of persistent search for a single\ntarget on a bounded domain. The searcher proceeds along ballistic trajectories\nand is absorbed upon collision with the target boundary. When reaching the\ndomain boundary, the searcher chooses a random direction for its new\ntrajectory. For circular domains and targets, we can approximate the mean first\npassage time (MFPT) using a Markov chain approximation of the search process.\nOur analysis and numerical simulations reveal that the time to find the target\ndecreases for targets closer to the domain boundary. When there is a small\nprobability of direction-switching within the domain, we find the time to find\nthe target decreases slightly with the turning probability. We also extend our\nexit time analysis to the case of partitioned domains, where there is a single\ntarget within one of multiple disjoint subdomains. Given an average time of\ntransition between domains $\\langle T \\rangle$, we find that the optimal rate\nof transition that minimizes the time to find the target obeys $\\beta_{{\\rm\nmin}} \\propto 1/ \\sqrt{\\langle T \\rangle}$.\n", "  The fragmentation of quasi-projectiles from the nuclear reaction 40Ca + 12C\nat 25 MeV/nucleon was used to produce alpha-emission sources. From a careful\nselection of these sources provided by a complete detection and from\ncomparisons with models of sequential and simultaneous decays, strong\nindications in favour of $\\alpha$-particle clustering in excited 16O, 20Ne and\n24}Mg are reported.\n", "  We perform a cosmological analysis in which we allow the primordial power\nspectrum of scalar perturbations to assume a shape that is different with\nrespect to the usual power-law, arising from the simplest models of\ncosmological inflation. We parametrize the primordial power spectrum with a\npiecewise monotone cubic Hermite function and we use it to investigate how the\nconstraints on the various cosmological parameters change: we find that the\nobtained limits are relaxed with respect to the power-law case, if CMB\npolarization data are not included. Moreover, the cosmological analyses provide\nus some indications about the shape of the reconstructed primordial power\nspectrum, where we notice possible features around\n$k\\simeq0.002\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k\\simeq0.0035\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. If\nconfirmed in future analyses involving enhanced experimental data, these\nfeatures suggests that the simplest cosmological inflation models may be\nincomplete.\n", "  We investigate various types of squeezing in a collective su(2J+1) system\nconsisting of spin-J particles (J>1/2). We show that the squeezing in the\ncollective su(2J+1) system can be classified into unitary equivalence classes,\neach of which is characterized by a set of squeezed and anti-squeezed\nobservables forming an su(2) subalgebra in the su(2J+1) algebra. The\ndimensionality of the unitary equivalence class is fundamentally related to its\nsqueezing limit. We also demonstrate the classification of the squeezing among\nthe spin and multipolar observables in a collective su(4) system.\n", "  We demonstrate the self-assembled growth of vertically aligned GaN nanowire\nensembles on a flexible Ti foil by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The\nanalysis of single nanowires by transmission electron microscopy reveals that\nthey are single crystalline. Low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy\ndemonstrates that, in comparison to standard GaN nanowires grown on Si, the\nnanowires prepared on the Ti foil exhibit a equivalent crystalline perfection,\na higher density of basal-plane stacking faults, but a reduced density of\ninversion domain boundaries. The room-temperature photoluminescence spectrum of\nthe nanowire ensemble is not influenced or degraded by the bending of the\nsubstrate. The present results pave the way for the fabrication of flexible\noptoelectronic devices based on GaN nanowires on metal foils.\n", "  We present SMA CO(2-1) observations toward the protostellar jet driven by\nSVS13A, a variable protostar in the NGC1333 star-forming region. The SMA\nCO(2-1) images show an extremely high-velocity jet composed of a series of\nmolecular 'bullets'. Based on the SMA CO observations, we discover clear and\nlarge systematic velocity gradients, perpendicular to the jet axis, in the\nblueshifted and redshifted bullets. After discussing several alternative\ninterpretations, such as twin-jets, jet precession, warped disk, and internal\nhelical shock, we suggest that the systematic velocity gradients observed in\nthe bullets result from the rotation of the SVS13A jet. From the SMA CO images,\nthe measured rotation velocities are 11.7-13.7 km/s for the blueshifted bullet\nand 4.7+/-0.5 km/s for the redshifted bullet. The estimated specific angular\nmomenta of the two bullets are comparable to those of dense cores, about 10\ntimes larger than those of protostellar envelopes, and about 20 times larger\nthan those of circumstellar disks. If the velocity gradients are due to the\nrotation of the SVS13A jet, the significant amount of specific angular momenta\nof the bullets indicates that the rotation of jets/outflows is a key mechanism\nto resolve the so-called 'angular momentum problem' in the field of star\nformation. The kinematics of the bullets suggests that the jet launching\nfootprint on the disk has a radius of about 7.2-7.7 au, which appears to\nsupport the extended disk-wind model. We note that further observations are\nneeded to comprehensively understand the kinematics of the SVS13A jet, in order\nto confirm the rotation nature of the bullets.\n", "  We study inverse magnetic catalysis in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model beyond\nmean field approximation. The feed-down from mesons to quarks is embedded in an\neffective coupling constant at finite temperature and magnetic field. While the\nmagnetic catalysis is still the dominant effect at low temperature, the meson\ndressed quark mass drops down with increasing magnetic field at high\ntemperature due to the dimension reduction of the Goldstone mode in the\nPauli-Villars regularization scheme.\n", "  From a quantum point of view, it is mandatory to include the measurement\nprocess when predicting the time-evolution of a quantum system. In this paper,\na model to treat the measurement of the (TeraHertz) THz electrical current in\nquantum devices is presented. The explicit interaction of a quantum system with\nan external measuring apparatus is analyzed through the unambiguous notion of\nthe Bohmian conditional wave function, the wave function of a subsystem. It it\nshown that such THz quantum measurement process can be modeled as a weak\nmeasurement: The systems suffers a small perturbation due to the apparatus, but\nthe current is measured with a great uncertainty. This uncertainty implies that\na new source of noise appears at THz frequencies. Numerical (quantum Monte\nCarlo) experiments are performed confirming the weak character of this\nmeasurement. This work also indicates that at low frequencies this noise is\nnegligible and it can be ignored. From a classical point of view, the origin of\nthis noise due to the measurement at THz frequencies can be attributed to the\nplasmonic effect of those electrons at the contacts (by interpreting the\ncontacts themselves as part of the measuring apparatus).\n", "  The particle-hole symmetry (equivalence) of the full shell-model Hilbert\nspace is straightforward and routinely used in practical calculations. In this\nwork we show that this symmetry is preserved in the subspace truncated at a\ncertain generalized seniority, and give the explicit transformation between the\nstates in the two types (particle and hole) of representations. Based on the\nresults, we study the particle-hole symmetry in popular theories that could be\nregarded as further truncations on top of the generalized seniority, including\nthe microscopic interacting boson (fermion) model, the nucleon-pair\napproximation, and others.\n", "  We study the effect of single biased tracer particle in a bath of other\nparticles performing the random average process (RAP) on an infinite line. We\nfocus on the large time behavior of the mean and the fluctuations of the\npositions of the particles and also the correlations among them. In the large\ntime t limit these quantities have well-defined scaling forms and grow with\ntime as $\\sqrt{t}$. A differential equation for the scaling function associated\nwith the correlation function is obtained and solved perturbatively around the\nsolution for a symmetric tracer. Interestingly, when the tracer is totally\nasymmetric, further progress is enabled by the fact that the particles behind\nof the tracer do not affect the motion of the particles in front of it, which\nleads in particular to an exact expression for the variance of the position of\nthe tracer. Finally, the variance and correlations of the gaps between\nsuccessive particles are also studied. Numerical simulations support our\nanalytical results.\n", "  We study minimal surfaces with a single cusp in a $q$-deformed\nAdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ background. The cusp is composed of two half-lines with an\narbitrary angle and is realized on a surface specified in the deformed AdS$_5$.\nThe classical string solutions attached to this cusp are regarded as a\ngeneralization of configurations studied by Drukker and Forini in the\nundeformed case. By taking an antiparallel-lines limit, a quark-antiquark\npotential for the $q$-deformed case is derived with a certain subtraction\nscheme. The resulting potential becomes linear at short distances with a finite\ndeformation parameter. In particular, the linear behavior for the gravity dual\nof noncommutative gauge theories can be reproduced as a special scaling limit.\nFinally we study the near straight-line limit of the potential.\n", "  In this paper several designs to maximize the absorption efficiency of\nsuperconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors are investigated. Using a\nsimple optical cavity consisting of a gold mirror and a SiO2 layer, the\nabsorption efficiency can be boosted to over 97%: this result is confirmed\nexperimentally by the realization of an NbTiN-based detector having an overall\nsystem detection efficiency of 85% at 1.31 micrometers. Calculations show that\nby sandwiching the nanowire between two dielectric Bragg reflectors, unity\nabsorption (> 99.9%) could be reached at the peak wavelength for optimized\nstructures. To achieve broadband high efficiency, a different approach is\nconsidered: a waveguide-coupled detector. The calculations performed in this\nwork show that, by correctly dimensioning the waveguide and the nanowire,\npolarization-insensitive detectors absorbing more than 95% of the injected\nphotons over a wavelength range of several hundred nm can be designed. We\npropose a detector design making use of GaN/AlN waveguides, since these\nmaterials allow lattice-matched epitaxial deposition of Nb(Ti)N films and are\ntransparent on a very wide wavelength range.\n", "  Through resistivity measurements of an organic crystal hosting massless Dirac\nfermions with a charge-ordering instability, we reveal the effect of\ninteractions among Dirac fermions on the charge transport. A low-temperature\nresistivity upturn appears robustly irrespectively of pressure and is enhanced\nwhile approaching the critical pressure of charge ordering, indicating that the\ninsulating behavior originates from short-range Coulomb interactions.\nObservation of apparently vanishing gap in the charge-ordered phase accords\nwith the theoretical prediction of the non-topological edge states.\n", "  The Gibbs canonical state, as a maximum entropy density matrix, represents a\nquantum system in equilibrium with a thermostat. This state plays an essential\nrole in thermodynamics and serves as the initial condition for nonequilibrium\ndynamical simulations. We solve a long standing problem for computing the Gibbs\nstate Wigner function with nearly machine accuracy by solving the Bloch\nequation directly in the phase space. Furthermore, the algorithms are provided\nyielding high quality Wigner distributions for pure stationary states as well\nas for Thomas-Fermi and Bose-Einstein distributions. The developed numerical\nmethods furnish a long-sought efficient computation framework for\nnonequilibrium quantum simulations directly in the Wigner representation.\n", "  The reaction $NN \\to NN \\pi$ offers a good testing ground for chiral\neffective field theory at intermediate energies. It challenges our\nunderstanding of the first inelastic channel in nucleon-nucleon scattering and\nof the charge-symmetry breaking pattern in hadronic reactions. In our previous\nstudies, we presented a complete calculation of the pion-production operator\nfor s-wave pions up-to-and-including next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in\nthe formulation of chiral effective field theory, which includes pions,\nnucleons and $\\Delta(1232)$ degrees of freedom. In this paper we calculate the\nnear threshold cross section for the $pp \\to d \\pi^{+}$ reaction by performing\nthe convolution of the obtained operators with nuclear wave functions based on\nmodern phenomenological and chiral potentials. The available chiral $NN$ wave\nfunctions are constructed with a cutoff comparable with the momentum transfer\nscale inherent in pion production reactions. Hence, a significant portion of\nthe dynamical intermediate-range physics is thereby cut off by them. On the\nother hand, the NNLO amplitudes evaluated with phenomenological wave functions\nappear to be largely independent of the $NN$ model used and give corrections to\nthe dominant leading order contributions as expected from dimensional analysis.\nThe result gives support to the counting scheme used to classify the pion\nproduction operators, which is a precondition for a reliable investigation of\nthe chirally suppressed neutral pion production. The explicit inclusion of the\n$\\Delta(1232)$ is found to be important but smaller than expected due to\ncancellations.\n", "  In the solar wind, magnetic field power spectra usually show several\npower-laws. In this paper, magnetic field data from the Cluster mission during\nan undisturbed interval of slow solar wind is analyzed at 0.28Hz, near the\nspectral break point between the ion inertial and dissipation/dispersion\nranges. Assuming Taylor's frozen-in condition, it corresponds to a proton\nkinetic scale of $kv_A/\\Omega_p \\sim 0.38$, where $v_A$ and $\\Omega_p$ are the\nAlfv\\'en speed and proton angular gyrofrequency, respectively. Data show that\nthe Cluster spacecraft passed through a series of wavepackets. A strong\nisolated wavepacket is found to be in accordance with the four Cluster\nsatellites crossing an Alfv\\'en vortex, a nonlinear solution to the\nincompressible MHD equations. A strong agreement is seen between the data from\nfour satellites and a model vortex with a radius of the order of $40$ times the\nlocal proton gyro-radii. The polarization at different spacecraft is compared\nand is found to agree with the vortex model, whereas it cannot be explained\nsolely by the linear plane wave approach.\n", "  The effect of substrate was studied using nanoindentation on thin films. Soft\nfilms on hard substrate showed more pile up than usual which was attributed to\nthe dislocation pile up at the film substrate interface. The effect of tip\nblunting on the load depth and hardness plots of nanoindentation was shown. The\nexperimental date of variation of Vickers hardness with film thickness and\nloads were fitted and new parameters were analyzed. The delaminated area was\nanalyzed using geometrical shapes using optical view of the failure region\nalong with the load displacement Indentation fracture using Nanoindentation\nusing Berkovich indenter has been studied. Indentation fracture toughness (KR)\nwas analyzed based on computational programs. The contact mechanics during\nnanoindentation was studied with parameters related to indenter shape and tip\nsharpness. Elastic, plastic and total energies were computationally determined.\nThe energy difference was related to shear stress being generated with elastic\nto plastic transition. Change in the nature of residual stress was related to\nfilm thickness.\n", "  In supersymmetric models where the superpotential mu term is generated with\nmu<< m_{soft} (e.g. from radiative Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking or\ncompactified string models with sequestration and stabilized moduli), and where\nthe string landscape 1. favors soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking terms as\nlarge as possible and 2. where the anthropic condition that electroweak\nsymmetry is properly broken with a weak scale m_{W,Z,h}~100 GeV ({\\it i.e.} not\ntoo weak of weak interactions), then these combined landscape/anthropic\nrequirements act as an attractor pulling the soft SUSY breaking terms towards\nvalues required by models with radiatively-driven naturalness: near the line of\ncriticality where electroweak symmetry is barely broken and the Higgs mass is\n~125 GeV. The pull on the soft terms serves to ameliorate the SUSY flavor and\nCP problems. The resulting sparticle mass spectrum may barely be accessible at\nhigh-luminosity LHC while the required light higgsinos should be visible at a\nlinear e^+e^- collider with \\sqrt{s}>2m(higgsino).\n", "  Our article is devoted to the study of the rare $B_s\\to \\phi \\ell^+\\ell^-$\ndecay where $\\ell=\\mu,\\tau$. We compute the relevant form factors in the\nframework of the covariant quark model with infrared confinement in the full\nkinematical momentum transfer region. The calculated form factors are used to\nevaluate branching fractions and polarization observables in the cascade decay\n$B\\to \\phi(\\to K^+K^-)\\ell^+\\ell^-$. We compare the obtained results with\navailable experimental data and the results from other theoretical approaches.\n", "  We consider the efficiency of self-phoretic colloidal particles (swimmers) as\na function of the heterogeneity in the surface reaction rate. The set of fluid,\nspecies, and electrostatic continuity equations is solved analytically using a\nlinearization and numerically using a finite-element method. To compare\nspherical swimmers of different size and with heterogeneous catalytic\nconversion rates, a 'swimmer efficiency' functional $\\eta$ is introduced. It is\nproven, that in order to obtain maximum swimmer efficiency the reactivity has\nto be localized at the pole(s). Our results also shed light on the sensitivity\nof the propulsion speed to details of the surface reactivity, a property that\nis notoriously hard to measure. This insight can be utilized in the design of\nnew self-phoretic swimmers.\n", "  After Planck 2013, a broad class of inflationary models called\n\\alpha-attractors was developed which has universal observational predictions.\nFor small values of the parameter \\alpha, the models have good consistency with\nthe recent CMB data. In this work, we first calculate analytically (and verify\nnumerically) the predictions of these models for spectral index, n_s and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio, r and then using BICEP2/Keck 2015 data we impose\nconstraints on \\alpha-attractors. Then, we study the reheating in\n\\alpha-attractors. The reheating temperature, T_{re} and the number of e-folds\nduring reheating, N_{re} are calculated as functions of n_s. Using these\nresults, we determine the range of free parameter \\alpha for two clasees of\n\\alpha-attractors which satisfy the constraints of recent CMB data.\n", "  Based on Kepler data, we present the results of a search for white-light\nflares on 1049 close binaries. We identify 234 flare binaries, on which 6818\nflares are detected. We compare the flare-binary fraction in different binary\nmorphologies (\"detachedness\"). The result shows that the fractions in\nover-contact and ellipsoidal binaries are approximately 10-20 percent lower\nthan those in detached and semi-detached systems. We calculate the binary\nflares activity level (AL) of all the flare binaries, and discuss its\nvariations along the orbital period (P_orb) and rotation period (P_rot,\ncalculated for only detached binaries). We find that AL increases with\ndecreasing P_orb or P_rot up to the critical values at P_orb near 3 days or\nP_rot near 1.5 days, thereafter, the AL starts decreasing no matter how fast\nthe stars rotate. We examine the flaring rate as a function of orbital phase in\n2 eclipsing binaries on which a large number of flares are detected. It appears\nthat there is no correlation between flaring rate and orbital phase in these 2\nbinaries. In contrast, when we examine the function with 203 flares on 20\nnon-eclipse ellipsoidal binaries, bimodal distribution of amplitude weighted\nflare numbers shows up at orbital phase 0.25 and 0.75. Such variation could be\nlarger than what is expected from the cross-section modification.\n", "  We propose a setup of an open quantum system in which the environment can be\ntuned such that either Markovian or non-Markovian system dynamics can be\nachieved. The implementation uses ultracold Rydberg atoms, relying on their\nstrong long-range interactions. Our suggestion extends the features available\nfor quantum simulators of molecular systems employing Rydberg aggregates and\npresents a new test bench for fundamental studies of the classification of\nsystem-environment interactions and the resulting system dynamics in open\nquantum systems.\n", "  The observation of cosmic gamma-rays from the ground is based upon the\ndetection of gamma-ray initiated air showers. At energies between approximately\n$10^{11}$ eV and $10^{13}$ eV, the imaging air Cherenkov technique is a\nparticularly successful approach to observe gamma-ray sources with energy\nfluxes as low as $\\approx 10^{-13}$ erg\\,cm$^{-2}\\,$s$^{-1}$. The observations\nof gamma-rays in this energy band probe particle acceleration in astrophysical\nplasma conditions and are sensitive to high energy phenomena beyond the\nstandard model of particle physics (e.g., self-annihilating or decaying dark\nmatter, violation of Lorentz invariance, mixing of photons with light\npseudo-scalars). The current standing of the field and its major instruments\nare summarised briefly by presenting selected highlights. A new generation of\nground based gamma-ray instruments is currently under development. The\nperspectives and opportunities of these future facilities will be discussed.\n", "  We investigate the structural and electronic properties of Li-intercalated\nmonolayer graphene on SiC(0001) using combined angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory. Li intercalates at\nroom temperature both at the interface between the buffer layer and SiC and\nbetween the two carbon layers. The graphene is strongly $n$-doped due to charge\ntransfer from the Li atoms and two $\\pi$-bands are visible at the\n$\\bar{K}$-point. After heating the sample to 300$^\\circ$C, these $\\pi$-bands\nbecome sharp and have a distinctly different dispersion to that of\nBernal-stacked bilayer graphene. We suggest that the Li atoms intercalate\nbetween the two carbon layers with an ordered structure, similar to that of\nbulk LiC$_6$. An AA-stacking of these two layers becomes energetically\nfavourable. The $\\pi$-bands around the $\\bar{K}$-point closely resemble the\ncalculated band structure of a C$_6$LiC$_6$ system, where the intercalated Li\natoms impose a super-potential on the graphene electronic structure that opens\npseudo-gaps at the Dirac points of the two $\\pi$-cones.\n", "  We report the generation of molecular hydrogen from water by laser\nirradiation, without any electrodes and photocatalysts. A near infrared pulsed\nnanosecond laser is used for exposure of colloidal solution of Au nanoparticles\nsuspended in water. Laser exposure of the colloidal solution results in\nformation of plasma of laser breakdown of liquid and emission of H2. The rate\nof H2 emission depends critically on the energy of laser pulses. There is a\ncertain threshold in laser fluence in liquid (around 50 J/cm2) below which\nplasma disappears and H2 emission stops. H2 emission from colloidal solution of\nAu nanoparticles in ethanol is higher than that from similar water colloid. It\nis found that formation of plasma and emission of H2 or D2 can be induced by\nlaser exposure of pure liquids, either H2O or D2O, respectively. The results\nare interpreted as water molecules splitting by direct electron impact from\nbreakdown plasma.\n", "  We consider all degenerate scalar-tensor theories that depend quadratically\non second order derivatives of a scalar field, which we have identified in a\nprevious work. These theories, whose degeneracy in general ensures the absence\nof Ostrogradski instability, include the quartic Horndenski Lagrangian as well\nas its quartic extension beyond Horndeski, but also other families of\nLagrangians. We study how all these theories transform under general\nconformal-disformal transformations and find that they can be separated into\nthree main classes that are stable under these transformations. This leads to a\ncomplete classification modulo conformal-disformal transformations. Finally, we\nshow that these higher order theories include mimetic gravity and some\nparticular khronometric theories. They also contain theories that do not\ncorrespond, to our knowledge, to already studied theories, even up to field\nredefinitions.\n", "  The AMBRE Project is a collaboration between the European Southern\nObservatory (ESO) and the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur (OCA) that has been\nestablished in order to carry out the determination of stellar atmospheric\nparameters for the archived spectra of four ESO spectrographs.\n  The analysis of the UVES archived spectra for their stellar parameters has\nbeen completed in the third phase of the AMBRE Project. From the complete\nESO:UVES archive dataset that was received covering the period 2000 to 2010,\n51921 spectra for the six standard setups were analysed. The AMBRE analysis\npipeline uses the stellar parameterisation algorithm MATISSE to obtain the\nstellar atmospheric parameters. The synthetic grid is currently constrained to\nFGKM stars only.\n  Stellar atmospheric parameters are reported for 12,403 of the 51,921 UVES\narchived spectra analysed in AMBRE:UVES. This equates to ~23.9% of the sample\nand ~3,708 stars. Effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and alpha\nelement to iron ratio abundances are provided for 10,212 spectra (~19.7%),\nwhile at least effective temperature is provided for the remaining 2,191\nspectra. Radial velocities are reported for 36,881 (~71.0%) of the analysed\narchive spectra. Typical external errors of sigmaTeff~110dex,\nsigmalogg~0.18dex, sigma[M/H]~0.13dex, and sigma[alpha/Fe]~0.05dex with some\nreported variation between giants and dwarfs and between setups are reported.\n  UVES is used to observe an extensive collection of stellar and non-stellar\nobjects all of which have been included in the archived dataset provided to OCA\nby ESO. The AMBRE analysis extracts those objects which lie within the FGKM\nparameter space of the AMBRE slow rotating synthetic spectra grid. Thus by\nhomogeneous blind analysis AMBRE has successfully extracted and parameterised\nthe targeted FGK stars (23.9% of the analysed sample) from within the ESO:UVES\narchive.\n", "  We develop a framework for studying the well-known universal term in the\nRenyi entropy for an arbitrary entangling region in four-dimensional conformal\nfield theories that are holographically dual to gravitational theories. The\nshape dependence of the Renyi entropy $S_n$ is described by two coefficients:\n$f_b(n)$ for traceless extrinsic curvature deformations and $f_c(n)$ for Weyl\ntensor deformations. We provide the first calculation of the coefficient\n$f_b(n)$ in interacting theories by relating it to the stress tensor one-point\nfunction in a deformed hyperboloid background. The latter is then determined by\na straightforward holographic calculation. Our results show that a previous\nconjecture $f_b(n) = f_c(n)$, motivated by surprising evidence from a variety\nof free field theories and studies of conical defects, fails holographically.\n", "  We present a new scheme for measuring the differential phase in dual atom\ninterferometers. The magnetic field is modulated in one interferometer, and the\ndifferential phase can be extracted without measuring the amplitude of the\nmagnetic field by combining the ellipse and linear fitting methods. The gravity\ngradient measurements are discussed based on dual atom interferometers.\nNumerical simulation shows that the systematic error of the differential phase\nmeasurement is largely decreased when the duration of the magnetic field is\nsymmetrically modulated. This combined fitting scheme has a high accuracy for\nmeasuring an arbitrary differential phase in dual atom interferometers.\n", "  We consider a gravitational model in dimension D with several forms, l scalar\nfields and a Lambda-term. We study cosmological-type block-diagonal metrics\ndefined on a product of an 1-dimensional interval and n oriented Einstein\nspaces. As an electromagnetic composite brane ansatz is adopted and certain\nrestrictions on the branes are imposed the conformally covariant Wheeler-DeWitt\n(WDW) equation for the model is studied. Under certain restrictions, asymptotic\nsolutions to the WDW equation are found in the limit of the formation of the\nbilliard walls. These solutions reduce the problem to the so-called quantum\nbilliard in (n + l - 1)-dimensional hyperbolic space. Several examples of\nquantum billiards in the model with electric and magnetic branes, e.g.\ncorresponding to hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, are considered. In the case n=2\nwe find a set of basis asymptotic solutions to the WDW equation and derive\nasymptotic solutions for the metric in the classical case.\n", "  Sinusoidal Bloch oscillations appear in band structures exposed to external\nfields. Landau-Zener (LZ) tunneling between different bands is usually a\ncounteracting effect limiting Bloch oscillations. Here we consider a flat band\nnetwork with two dispersive and one flat bands, e.g. for ultracold atoms and\noptical waveguide networks. Using external synthetic gauge and gravitational\nfields we obtain a perturbed yet gapless band structure with almost flat parts.\nThe resulting Bloch oscillations consist of two parts - a fast scan through the\nnonflat part of the dispersion structure, and an almost complete halt for\nsubstantial time when the atomic wave packet is trapped in the original flat\nband part of the unperturbed spectrum, made possible due to LZ tunneling.\n", "  Because of the enormous range of time and space scales involved in\ndislocation dynamics, plastic modeling at macroscale requires a continuous\nformulation. In this paper, we present a rigorous formulation of the transition\nbetween the discrete, where plastic flow is resolved at the scale of individual\ndislocations, and the continuum, where dislocations are represented by\ndensities. First, we focus on the underlying coarse-graining procedure and show\nthat the emerging correlation-induced stresses are scale-dependent. Each of\nthese stresses can be expanded into the sum of two components. The first one\ndepends on the local values of the dislocation densities and always opposes the\nsum of the applied stress and long-range mean field stress generated by the\ngeometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density; this stress acts as a\nfriction stress. The second component depends on the local gradients of the\ndislocation densities and is inherently associated to a translation of the\nelastic domain; therefore, it acts as a back-stress. We also show that these\nfriction and back- stresses contain symmetry-breaking components that make the\nlocal stress experienced by dislocations to depend on the sign of their Burgers\nvector.\n", "  Knowledge of the distant high-energy universe comes from photons, ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays (UHECRs), high-energy neutrinos, and gravitational waves.\nThe theory of high-energy messengers reviewed here focuses on the extragalactic\nbackground light at all wavelengths, cosmic rays and magnetic fields in\nintergalactic space, and neutrinos of extragalactic origin. Comparisons are\ndrawn between the intensities of photons and UHECRs in intergalactic space, and\nthe high-energy neutrinos recently detected with IceCube at about the\nWaxman-Bahcall flux. Source candidates for UHECRs and high-energy neutrinos are\nreviewed, focusing on star-forming and radio-loud active galaxies. HAWC and\nAdvanced LIGO are just underway, with much anticipation.\n", "  The intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF) autonomously responded to\nand promptly tiled the error region of the first gravitational wave event\nGW150914 to search for an optical counterpart. Only a small fraction of the\ntotal localized region was immediately visible in the Northern night sky, due\nboth to sun-angle and elevation constraints. Here, we report on the transient\ncandidates identified and rapid follow-up undertaken to determine the nature of\neach candidate. Even in the small area imaged of 126 sq deg, after extensive\nfiltering, 8 candidates were deemed worthy of additional follow-up. Within two\nhours, all 8 were spectroscopically classified by the Keck II telescope.\nCuriously, even though such events are rare, one of our candidates was a\nsuperluminous supernova. We obtained radio data with the Jansky Very Large\nArray and X-ray follow-up with the Swift satellite for this transient. None of\nour candidates appear to be associated with the gravitational wave trigger,\nwhich is unsurprising given that GW150914 came from the merger of two\nstellar-mass black holes. This end-to-end discovery and follow-up campaign\nbodes well for future searches in this post-detection era of gravitational\nwaves.\n", "  For a systematic assessment of submillimeter observing conditions at\ndifferent sites, we constructed tipping radiometers to measure the broad band\natmospheric transparency in the window around 350 $\\mu$m wavelength. The\ntippers were deployed on Maunakea, Hawaii, at the South Pole, and in the\nvicinity of Cerro Chajnantor in northern Chile. Identical instruments permit\ndirect comparison of these sites. Observing conditions at the South Pole and in\nthe Chajnantor area are better than on Maunakea. Simultaneous measurements with\ntwo tippers demonstrate conditions at the summit of Cerro Chajnantor are\nsignificantly better than on the Chajnantor plateau.\n", "  In this letter we report on the unexpected possibility of applying the\nfull-deautonomisation approach we recently proposed for predicting the\nalgebraic entropy of second-order birational mappings, to discrete lattice\nequations. Moreover, we show, on two examples, that the full-deautonomisation\ntechnique can in fact also be successfully applied to reductions of these\nlattice equations to mappings with orders higher than 2. In particular, we\napply this technique to a recently discovered lattice equation that has\nconfined singularities while being nonintegrable, and we show that our approach\naccurately predicts this nonintegrable character. Finally, we demonstrate how\nour method can even be used to predict the algebraic entropy for some\nnonconfining higher order mappings.\n", "  Symmetries play a crucial role in ubiquitous systems found in Nature. In this\nwork, we propose an elegant approach to detect symmetries by measuring quantum\ncurrents. Our detection scheme relies on initiating the system in an\nanti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and\nusing a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the\nprobe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau\nindicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case\nof multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish\ncompletely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer\nthan the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a\n$4$-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown\nto be robust under a weak disorder.\n", "  A theoretical rate constant for the associative detachment reaction\nRb($^{2}S$)$+$OH$^{-}$($^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$)$\\rightarrow \\,$\nRbOH($^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$)$+\\,e^{-}$ of 4$\\,\\times$10$^{-10}$cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ at\n300 K has been calculated. This result agrees with the experimental rate\nconstant of 2$^{+2}_{-1}\\,\\times10^{-10}$cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$ obtained by Deiglmayr\n\\textit{et al.} (Phys. Rev. A 86, 2012) for a temperature between 200 K and 600\nK. A Langevin-based dynamics which depends on the crossing point between the\nanion (RbOH$^{-}$) and neutral (RbOH) potential energy surfaces has been used.\nThe calculation were performed using the ECP28MDF effective core potential to\ndescribe the rubidium atom at the CCSD(T) level of theory and extended basis\nsets. The effect of ECPs and basis set on the height of the crossing point, and\nhence the rate constant, has been investigated. The temperature dependence of\nthe latter is also discussed. Preliminary work on the potential energy surface\nfor the excited reaction channel Rb($^{2}P$)+OH$^{-}$($^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$)\ncalculated at the CASSF-icMRCI level of theory is shown. We qualitatively\ndiscuss the charge transfer and associative detachment reactions arising from\nthis excited entrance channel.\n", "  Random unimodular lattice triangulations have been recently used as an\nembedded random graph model, which exhibit a crossover behaviour between an\nordered, large-world and a disordered, small-world behaviour. Using the ergodic\nPachner flips that transform such triangulations into another and an energy\nfunctional that corresponds to the degree distribution variance, Markov chain\nMonte-Carlo simulations can be applied to study these graphs. Here, we consider\nthe spectra of the adja cency and the Laplacian matrix as well as the algebraic\nconnectivity and the spectral radius. Power law dependencies on the system size\ncan clearly be identified and compared to analytical solutions for periodic\nground states. For random triangulations we find a qualitative agreement of the\nspectral properties with well-known random graph models. In the microcanonical\nensemble analytical approximations agree with numerical simulations. In the\ncanonical ensemble a crossover behaviour can be found for the algebraic\nconnectivity and the spectral radius, thus combining large-world and\nsmall-world behavior in one model. The considered spectral properties can be\napplied to transport problems on triangulation graphs and the crossover\nbehaviour allows a tuning of important transport quantities.\n", "  We present measurements of the superconducting and charge density wave\ncritical temperatures (Tc and TCDW) as a function of pressure in the transition\nmetal dichalchogenides 2H-TaSe2 and 2H-TaS2. Resistance and susceptibility\nmeasurements show that Tc increases from temperatures below 1 K up to 8.5 K at\n9.5 GPa in 2H-TaS2 and 8.2 K at 23 GPa in 2H-TaSe2. We observe a kink in the\npressure dependence of TCDW at about 4 GPa that we attribute to the lock-in\ntransition from incommensurate CDW to commensurate CDW. Above this pressure,\nthe commensurate TCDW slowly decreases coexisting with superconductivity within\nour full pressure range.\n", "  We report direct evidence of superfluidity in a quasi two-dimensional Bose\ngas by observing its dynamical response to a collective excitation. Relying on\na novel local correlation analysis, we are able to probe inhomogeneous clouds\nand reveal their local dynamics. We identify in this way the superfluid and\nthermal phases inside the gas and locate the boundary at which the\nBerezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless crossover occurs. This new analysis also\nallows to evidence the coupling of the two fluids which induces at finite\ntemperatures damping rates larger than the usual Landau damping.\n", "  QCD and related gauge theories have a sign problem when a $\\theta$-term is\nincluded; this complicates the extraction of physical information from\nEuclidean space calculations as one would do in lattice studies. The sign\nproblem arises in this system because the partition function for configurations\nwith fixed topological charge $Q$, $\\mathcal{Z}_Q$, are summed weighted by\n$\\exp(i Q \\theta)$ to obtain the partition function for fixed $\\theta$, $\n\\mathcal{Z}(\\theta)$. The sign problem gets exponentially worse numerically as\nthe space-time volume is increased. Here it is shown that apart from the\npractical numerical issues associated with large volumes, there are some\ninteresting issues of principle. A key quantity is the energy density as a\nfunction of $\\theta$, $\\varepsilon(\\theta) = -\\log \\left( \\mathcal{Z}(\\theta)\n\\right )/V$. This is expected to be well defined in the large 4-volume limit.\nSimilarly, one expects the energy density for a fixed topological density\n$\\tilde{\\varepsilon}(Q/V) = -\\log \\left(\\mathcal{Z}_Q \\right )/V$ to be well\ndefined in the limit of large 4-volumes. Intuitively, one might expect that if\none had the infinite volume expression for $\\tilde{\\varepsilon}(Q/V)$ to\narbitrary accuracy, that one could reconstruct $\\varepsilon(\\theta)$ by\ndirectly summing over the topological sectors of the partition function. We\nshow here that there are circumstances where this is not the case. In\nparticular, this occurs in regions where the curvature of $\\varepsilon(\\theta)$\nis negative.\n", "  In this paper we suggest a simple analytical method for description of\nelectromagnetic properties of a geometrically regular two-dimensional\nsubwavelength arrays (metasurfaces) formed by particles with randomly\nfluctuating polarizabilities. Such metasurfaces are of topical importance due\nto development of mass-scale bottom-up fabrication methods, for which\nfluctuations of the particles sizes, shapes, and/or composition are inevitable.\nUnderstanding and prediction of electromagnetic properties of such random\nmetasurfaces is a challenge. We propose an analytical homogenization method\napplicable for normal wave incidence on particles arrays with dominating\nelectric dipole responses and validate it with numerical point-dipole modeling\nusing the supercell approach. We demonstrate that fluctuations of particles\npolarizabilities lead to increased diffuse scattering despite the subwavelength\nlattice constant of the array. The proposed method can be readily extended to\noblique incidence and particles with both electric and magnetic dipole\nresonances.\n", "  The effective transparency of rare-gas clusters, post-interaction with an\nextreme ultraviolet (XUV) pump pulse, is predicted by using an atomistic hybrid\nquantum-classical molecular dynamics model. We find there is an intensity range\nfor which an XUV probe pulse has no lasting effect on the average charge state\nof a cluster after being saturated by an XUV pump pulse: the cluster is\neffectively transparent to the probe pulse. The intensity range for which this\nphenomena occurs increases with cluster size, and thus is amenable to\nexperimental verification. We present predictions for clusters at the peak of\nthe laser pulse profile, as well as the expected experimental time-of-flight\nsignal integrated over the laser profile. Since our model uses only atomic\nphotoionization rates, significant experimental deviations from our predictions\nwould provide evidence for modified ionization potentials due to plasma\neffects.\n", "  We report an efficient implementation of a second-order multireference\nperturbation theory based on the driven similarity renormalization group\n(DSRG-MRPT2) [C. Li and F. A. Evangelista, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 2097\n(2015)]. Our implementation employs factorized two-electron integrals to avoid\nstorage of large four-index intermediates. It also exploits the block structure\nof the reference density matrices to reduce the computational cost to that of\nsecond-order M{\\o}ller$-$Plesset perturbation theory. Our new DSRG-MRPT2\nimplementation is benchmarked on ten naphthyne isomers using basis sets up to\nquintuple-$\\zeta$ quality. We find that the singlet-triplet splittings\n($\\Delta_\\text{ST}$) of the naphthyne isomers strongly depend on the\nequilibrium structures. For a consistent set of geometries, the\n$\\Delta_\\text{ST}$ values predicted by the DSRG-MRPT2 are in good agreements\nwith those computed by the reduced multireference coupled cluster theory with\nsingles, doubles, and perturbative triples.\n", "  Active (i.e., self-propelled or swimming) particles moving through an\nisotropic fluid exhibit conventional diffusive behavior. We report anomalous\ndiffusion of an active particle moving in an anisotropic, nematic background.\nWhilst the translational motion parallel to the nematic director shows\nballistic behavior, the long-time transverse motion is super-diffusive, with an\nanomalous scaling $\\propto t \\ln t$ of the mean squared displacement with time\n$t$. This behavior is predicted by an analytical theory that we present here,\nand is corroborated by numerical simulation of active particle diffusion in a\nsimple lattice model for a nematic liquid crystal. It is universal for any\ncollection of self-propelled elements (e.g., bacteria or active rods) moving in\na nematic background, provided only that the swimmers are sufficiently dilute\nthat their interactions with each other can be neglected, and that they do not\nperform \"hairpin\" turns.\n", "  The ferrimagnetic spinel Mn3O4 exhibits large and anisotropic changes in\nelectronic and structural properties in response to an applied magnetic field.\nThese changes are thought to result from the field-dependent tuning---via\nstrong spin-lattice coupling---between two nearly degenerate magnetostructural\nphases. Recent variable-magnetic-field studies of Mn3O4 have been performed on\nmelt-grown crystals, which can exhibit twin domains due to a Jahn-Teller\nstructural transition below the melting temperature. Because of the near\ndegeneracy of the magnetostructural phases, however, strain associated with the\ntwin domains likely affects the magnetic responses of Mn3O4. In this report, we\npresent a variable-magnetic-field Raman scattering study of untwinned Mn3O4\ncrystals grown out of a flux below the Jahn-Teller structural transition. We\nmeasure distinct q = 0 magnetic and vibrational excitation spectra for each\nisolated magnetostructural phase of untwinned Mn3O4 crystals and determine the\nsymmetries of the observed excitations. We determine how the magnetostructural\nphase mixture changes in response to magnetic fields applied in the magnetic\neasy plane. Lastly, by comparing results on flux- and melt-grown Mn3O4\ncrystals, we show that the intrinsic mixture of the two magnetostructural\nphases is indeed strongly influenced by the presence of twin domains.\n", "  The classical Vaidya metric is transformed to the special diagonal\ncoordinates in the case of the linear mass function allowing rather easy\ntreatment. We find the exact analytical expressions for metric functions in\nthese diagonal coordinates. Using these coordinates, we elaborate the maximum\nanalytic extension of the Vaidya metric with a linear growth of the black hole\nmass and construct the corresponding Carter-Penrose diagrams for different\nspecific cases. The derived global geometry seemingly is valid also for a more\ngeneral behavior of the black hole mass in the Vaidya metric.\n", "  Topological magnon insulators are a new class of magnetic materials that\npossess topologically nontrivial magnon bands. As a result, magnons in these\nmaterials display properties analogous to those of electrons in topological\ninsulators. Here, we present magnetization, specific heat, and neutron\nscattering measurements of the ferromagnetic kagome magnet Cu(1,3-bdc). Our\nmeasurements provide a detailed description of the magnetic structure and\ninteractions in this material, and confirm that it is an ideal prototype for\ntopological magnon physics in a system with a simple spin Hamiltonian.\n", "  Locally decreasing the impulse transmitted by periodic pulses is shown to be\na reliable method of taming chaos in starlike networks of dissipative nonlinear\noscillators, leading to both synchronous periodic states and equilibria\n(oscillation death). Specifically, the paradigmatic model of damped kicked\nrotators is studied in which it is assumed that when the rotators are driven\nsynchronously, i.e., all driving pulses transmit the same impulse, the networks\ndisplay chaotic dynamics. It is found that the taming effect of decreasing the\nimpulse transmitted by the pulses acting on particular nodes strongly depends\non their number and degree of connectivity. A theoretical analysis is given\nexplaining the basic physical mechanism as well as the main features of the\nchaos-control scenario.\n", "  The calculation of line widths constitutes theoretical and computational\nchallenges in the calculation of opacities of hot dense plasmas. Opacity models\nuse line broadening approximations that are untested at stellar interior\nconditions. Moreover, calculations of atomic spectra of the sun, indicate a\nlarge discrepancy in the K-shell line widths between several atomic codes and\nthe OP. In this work, the atomic code STAR is used to study the sensitivity of\nsolar opacities to line-broadening. Variations in the solar opacity profile,\ndue to an increase of the Stark widths resulting from discrepancies with OP,\nare compared, in light of the solar opacity problem, with the required opacity\nvariations of the present day sun, as imposed by helioseismic and neutrino\nobservations. The resulting variation profile, is much larger than the\ndiscrepancy between different atomic codes, agrees qualitatively with the\nmissing opacity profile, recovers about half of the missing opacity nearby the\nconvection boundary and has a little effect in the internal regions. Since it\nis hard to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty in the Stark widths, we show\nthat an increase of all line widths by a factor of about 100 recovers\nquantitatively the missing opacity. These results emphasize the possibility\nthat photoexcitation processes are not modeled properly, and more specifically,\nhighlight the need for a better theoretical characterization of the line\nbroadening phenomena at stellar interior conditions and of the uncertainty due\nto the way it is implemented by atomic codes.\n", "  We reexamine the effect of long-range Coulomb interactions on the\nquasiparticle velocity in graphene. Using a nonperturbative functional\nrenormalization group approach with partial bosonization in the forward\nscattering channel and momentum transfer cutoff scheme, we calculate the\nquasiparticle velocity, $v (k)$, and the quasiparticle residue, $Z$, with\nfrequency-dependent polarization. One of our most striking results is that $v (\nk ) \\propto \\ln [ C_k (\\alpha) / k ]$ where the momentum- and\ninteraction-dependent cutoff scale $C_k (\\alpha) $ vanishes logarithmically for\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. Here $k$ is measured with respect to one of the charge\nneutrality (Dirac) points and $\\alpha=2.2$ is the strength of dimensionless\nbare interaction. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the so-obtained\nmultilogarithmic singularity is reconcilable with the perturbative expansion of\n$v (k)$ in powers of the bare interaction.\n", "  As lower-mass stars often host multiple rocky planets, gravitational\ninteractions among planets can have significant effects on climate and\nhabitability over long timescales. Here we explore a specific case, Kepler-62f,\na potentially habitable planet in a five-planet system with a K2V host star.\nN-body integrations reveal the stable range of initial eccentricities for\nKepler-62f is $0.00 \\leqslant e \\leqslant 0.32$, absent the effect of\nadditional, undetected planets. We simulate the tidal evolution of Kepler-62f\nin this range and find that, for certain assumptions, the planet can be locked\nin a synchronous rotation state. Simulations using LMD Generic GCM indicate\nthat with 3 bars of CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, Kepler-62f would only be warm\nenough for surface liquid water at the upper limit of this eccentricity range,\nproviding it has a high planetary obliquity (between 60$^\\circ$ and\n90$^\\circ$). A climate similar to modern-day Earth is possible for the entire\nrange of stable eccentricities if atmospheric CO$_2$ is increased to 5-bar\nlevels. In a low-CO$_2$ case, simulations with CCSM4 and LMD Generic GCM\nindicate that increases in planetary obliquity and orbital eccentricity coupled\nwith an orbital configuration that places the summer solstice at or near\npericenter permit regions of the planet with above-freezing surface\ntemperatures. This may melt ice sheets formed during colder seasons. If\nKepler-62f is synchronously rotating and has an ocean, CO$_2$ levels above 3\nbars would be required to distribute enough heat to the night side of the\nplanet to avoid atmospheric freeze-out and permit a large enough region of open\nwater at the planet's substellar point to remain stable. Overall, we find\nmultiple plausible combinations of orbital and atmospheric properties that\npermit surface liquid water on Kepler-62f.\n", "  With the best overall electronic and thermal properties, single crystal\ndiamond (SCD) is the extreme wide bandgap material that is expected to\nrevolutionize power electronics and radio-frequency electronics in the future.\nHowever, turning SCD into useful semiconductors requires overcoming doping\nchallenges, as conventional substitutional doping techniques, such as thermal\ndiffusion and ion implantation, are not easily applicable to SCD. Here we\nreport a simple and easily accessible doping strategy demonstrating that\nelectrically activated, substitutional doping in SCD without inducing\ngraphitization transition or lattice damage can be readily realized with\nthermal diffusion at relatively low temperatures by using heavily doped Si\nnanomembranes as a unique dopant carrying medium. Atomistic simulations\nelucidate a vacancy exchange boron doping mechanism that occur at the bonded\ninterface between Si and diamond. We further demonstrate selectively doped high\nvoltage diodes and half-wave rectifier circuits using such doped SCD. Our new\ndoping strategy has established a reachable path toward using SCDs for future\nhigh voltage power conversion systems and for other novel diamond based\nelectronic devices. The novel doping mechanism may find its critical use in\nother wide bandgap semiconductors.\n", "  We have assembled the historical variability data of Mrk 421 at radio 15 GHz,\nX-ray and gamma-ray bands, spanning about 6.3, 10.3 and 7.5 yr, respective- ly.\nWe analyzed the variability by using three methods. The results indicated that\nthere is a period of 287.6 +- 4.4 days for 15 GHz, 309.5 +- 5.8 days for X- ray\nand 283.4+- 4.7 days for gamma-ray, respectively. This period can be reasonably\nexplained by the nonballistic helical motion of the emitting material. The cor-\nrelation analysis suggested that the variabilities of radio 15 GHz, X-ray and\n0-ray are remarkable correlated, and the emission of radio 15 GHz lags behind\nthat of X-ray, and the X-ray flux lags behind the gamma-ray. This suggests that\nthe gamma-ray derives from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the synchrotron\nphotons, supporting the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. Moreover, the\ntime delay between different wavebands could be explained by the shock-in-jet\nmodels, in which a moving emission region produces the radio to gamma-ray\nactivity, implying that the emission region of gamma-ray is closer to the\ncenter than ones of X-ray and radio emission.\n", "  We study a variable-coefficient nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (vc-NLS) equation\nwith higher-order effects. We show that the breather solution can be converted\ninto four types of nonlinear waves on constant backgrounds including the\nmulti-peak solitons, antidark soliton, periodic wave and W-shaped soliton. The\ntransition condition requiring the group velocity dispersion (GVD) and\nthird-order dispersion (TOD) to scale linearly is obtained analytically. We\ndisplay several kinds of elastic interactions between the transformed nonlinear\nwaves. We discuss the dispersion management of multi-peak soliton, which\nindicates that the GVD coefficient controls the number of peaks of the wave\nwhile the TOD coefficient has compression effect. The gain or loss has\ninfluence on the amplitudes of the multi-peak soliton. We further derive the\nbreather multiple births by using multiple compression points of Akhmediev\nbreathers in optical fiber systems with periodic dispersion. The number of ABs\ndepends on the amplitude of the modulation but not on its wavelength, which\naffects their separation distance. In the limiting case, the breather multiple\nbirths reduce to the Peregrine combs. We discuss the effects of TOD coefficient\non the spatiotemporal characteristics of Peregrine combs. When the amplitude of\nthe modulation is equal to 1, the Peregrine comb is converted into a Peregrine\nwall that can be seen as intermediate state between rogue wave and W-shaped\nsoliton. We finally find that the modulational stability regions with zero\ngrowth rate coincide with the transition condition using rogue wave\neigenvalues. Our results could be useful for the experimental control and\nmanipulation of the formation of generalized Peregrine rogue waves in diverse\nphysical systems modeled by vc-NLS equation with higher-order effects.\n", "  The conventional Wien filter is a device with orthogonal static magnetic and\nelectric fields, often used for velocity separation of charged particles. Here\nwe describe the electromagnetic design calculations for a novel waveguide RF\nWien filter that will be employed to solely manipulate the spins of protons or\ndeuterons at frequencies of about 0.1 to 2 MHz at the COoler SYnchrotron COSY\nat J\\\"ulich. The device will be used in a future experiment that aims at\nmeasuring the proton and deuteron electric dipole moments, which are expected\nto be very small. Their determination, however, would have a huge impact on our\nunderstanding of the universe.\n", "  Low mass, self-gravitating accretion disks admit\nquasi-steady,`gravito-turbulent' states in which cooling balances turbulent\nviscous heating. However, numerical simulations show that gravito-turbulence\ncannot be sustained beyond dynamical timescales when the cooling rate or\ncorresponding turbulent viscosity is too large. The result is disk\nfragmentation. We motivate and quantify an interpretation of disk fragmentation\nas the inability to maintain gravito-turbulence due to formal secondary\ninstabilities driven by: 1) cooling, which reduces pressure support; and/or 2)\nviscosity, which reduces rotational support. We analyze the axisymmetric\ngravitational stability of viscous, non-adiabatic accretion disks with internal\nheating, external irradiation, and cooling in the shearing box approximation.\nWe consider parameterized cooling functions in 2D and 3D disks, as well as\nradiative diffusion in 3D. We show that generally there is no critical cooling\nrate/viscosity below which the disk is formally stable, although interesting\nlimits appear for unstable modes with lengthscales on the order of the disk\nthickness. We apply this new linear theory to protoplanetary disks subject to\ngravito-turbulence modeled as an effective viscosity, and cooling regulated by\ndust opacity. We find that viscosity renders the disk beyond $\\sim 60$AU\ndynamically unstable on radial lengthscales a few times the local disk\nthickness. This is coincident with the empirical condition for disk\nfragmentation based on a maximum sustainable stress. We suggest turbulent\nstresses can play an active role in realistic disk fragmentation by removing\nrotational stabilization against self-gravity, and that the observed transition\nin behavior from gravito-turbulent to fragmenting may reflect instability of\nthe gravito-turbulent state itself.\n", "  In special tests, the active layers of the CALICE Digital Hadron Calorimeter\nprototype, the DHCAL, were exposed to low energy particle beams, without being\ninterleaved by absorber plates. The thickness of each layer corresponded\napproximately to 0.29 radiation lengths or 0.034 nuclear interaction lengths,\ndefined mostly by the copper and steel skins of the detector cassettes. This\npaper reports on measurements performed with this device in the Fermilab test\nbeam with positrons in the energy range of 1 to 10 GeV. The measurements are\ncompared to simulations based on GEANT4 and a standalone program to emulate the\ndetailed response of the active elements.\n", "  We report calculations of the surface tension of the water-air interface\nusing ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We investigate the\nsimulation cell size dependence of the surface tension of water from force\nfield molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which show that the calculated\nsurface tension increases with increasing simulation cell size, thereby\nillustrating that a correction for finite size effects is required for the\nsmall system used in the AIMD simulation. The AIMD simulations reveal that the\ndouble-{\\xi} basis set overestimates the experimentally measured surface\ntension due to the Pulay stress, while the triple and quadruple-{\\xi} basis\nsets give similar results. We further demonstrate that the van der Waals\ncorrections critically affect the surface tension. AIMD simulations without the\nvan der Waals correction substantially underestimate the surface tension, while\nvan der Waals correction with the Grimme's D2 technique results in the value\nfor the surface tension that is too high. The Grimme's D3 van der Waals\ncorrection provides a surface tension close to the experimental value. Whereas\nthe specific choices for the van der Waals correction and basis sets critically\naffect the calculated surface tension, the surface tension is remarkably\ninsensitive to the details of the exchange and correlation functionals, which\nhighlights the impact of long-range interactions on the surface tension. These\nsimulated values provide important benchmarks, both for improving van der Waals\ncorrections, and AIMD simulations of aqueous interfaces.\n", "  There is a growing interest in the study of coupled plasma-liquid systems\nbecause of their applications to biomedicine, biological and chemical\ndisinfection, agriculture, and other areas. Without an understanding of the\nnear-surface gas dynamics, modellers are left to make assumptions about the\ninterfacial conditions. For instance it is commonly assumed that the surface\nloss or sticking coefficient of gas-phase electrons at the interface is equal\nto 1. In this work we explore the consequences of this assumption and introduce\na couple of ways to think about the electron interfacial condition. In one set\nof simulations we impose a kinetic condition with varying surface loss\ncoefficient on the gas phase interfacial electrons. In a second set of\nsimulations we introduce a Henry's law like condition at the interface in which\nthe gas-phase electron concentration is assumed to be in thermodynamic\nequilibrium with the liquid-phase electron concentration. It is shown that for\na range of electron Henry coefficients spanning a range of known hydrophilic\nspecie Henry coefficients, the gas phase electron density in the anode can vary\nby orders of magnitude. Varying reflection of electrons by the interface also\nhas consequences for the electron energy profile. This variation in anode\nelectron density and energy as a function of the interface characteristics\ncould also lead to significant variation in near-surface gas chemistries when\nsuch reactions are included in the model; this could very well in turn affect\nthe reactive species impinging on the liquid surface. We draw the conclusion\nthat in order to make more confident model predictions about plasma-liquid\nsystems, finer scale simulations and/or new experimental techniques must be\nused to elucidate the near-surface gas phase electron dynamics.\n", "  We discuss a possible interpretation of the $750$ GeV diphoton resonance,\nrecently reported at the LHC, within a class of $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times\nSU(4)$ models with gauge coupling unification. The unification is imposed by\nthe underlying non-commutative geometry (NCG), which in these models is\nextended to a left-right symmetric completion of the Standard Model (SM).\nWithin such \\textit{unified} $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times SU(4)$ models the\nHiggs content is restrictively determined from the underlying NCG, instead of\nbeing arbitrarily selected. We show that the observed cross sections involving\nthe $750$ GeV diphoton resonance could be realized through a SM singlet scalar\nfield accompanied by colored scalars, present in these unified models. In view\nof this result we discuss the underlying rigidity of these models in the NCG\nframework and the wider implications of the NCG approach for physics beyond the\nSM.\n", "  We analyze the $\\alpha$-$^{12}$C inelastic scattering to the $0^+_2$ state of\n$^{12}$C, the Hoyle state, in a fully microscopic framework. With no free\nadjustable parameter, the inelastic cross sections at forward angles are well\nreproduced by the microscopic reaction calculation using the transition density\nof $^{12}$C obtained by the resonating group method and the nucleon-nucleon $g$\nmatrix interaction developed by the Melbourne group. It is thus shown that the\nmonopole transition strength obtained by the structural calculation is\nconsistent with that extracted from the reaction observable, suggesting no\nmissing monopole strength of the Hoyle state.\n", "  We consider a topological superconducting wire and use the string order\nparameter to investigate the spatiotemporal evolution of the topological order\nupon a quantum quench across the critical point. We also analyze the\npropagation of the initially localized Majorana bound states after the quench,\nin order to examine the connection between the topological order and the\nunpaired Majorana states, which has been well established at equilibrium but\nremains illusive in dynamical situations. It is found that after the quench the\nstring order parameters decay over a finite time and that the decaying behavior\nis universal, independent of the wire length and the final value of the\nchemical potential (the quenching parameter). It is also found that the\ntopological order is revived repeatedly although the amplitude gradually\ndecreases. Further, the topological order can propagate into the region which\nwas initially in the non-topological state. It is observed that all these\nbehaviors are in parallel and consistent with the propagation and dispersion of\nthe Majorana wave functions. Finally, we propose a local probing method which\ncan measure the non-local topological order.\n", "  We perform neutrino radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for the merger of\nasymmetric binary neutron stars in numerical relativity. Neutron stars are\nmodeled by soft and moderately stiff finite-temperature equations of state\n(EOS). We find that the properties of the dynamical ejecta such as the total\nmass, neutron richness profile, and specific entropy profile depend on the mass\nratio of the binary systems for a given EOS in a unique manner. For the soft\nEOS (SFHo), the total ejecta mass depends weakly on the mass ratio, but the\naverage of electron number per baryon ($Y_e$) and specific entropy ($s$) of the\nejecta decreases significantly with the increase of the degree of mass\nasymmetry. For the stiff EOS (DD2), with the increase of the mass asymmetry\ndegree, the total ejecta mass significantly increases while the average of\n$Y_e$ and $s$ moderately decreases. We find again that only for the soft EOS\n(SFHo), the total ejecta mass exceeds $0.01M_\\odot$ irrespective of the mass\nratio chosen in this paper. The ejecta have a variety of electron number per\nbaryon with its average approximately between $Y_e \\sim 0.2$ and $\\sim 0.3$\nirrespective of the EOS employed, which is well-suited for the production of\nthe r-process heavy elements (second and third peaks), although its averaged\nvalue decreases with the increase of the degree of mass asymmetry.\n", "  We study four-dimensional conformal field theories with an $SU(N)$ global\nsymmetry by employing the numerical conformal bootstrap. We consider the\ncrossing relation associated with a four-point function of a spin~$0$\noperator~$\\phi_i^{\\Bar{k}}$ which belongs to the adjoint representation of\n$SU(N)$. For~$N=12$ for example, we found that the theory contains a spin~$0$\n$SU(12)$-breaking relevant operator when the scaling dimension\nof~$\\phi_i^{\\Bar{k}}$, $\\Delta_{\\phi_i^{\\Bar{k}}}$, is smaller than~$1.71$.\nConsidering the lattice simulation of many-flavor quantum chromodynamics with\n$12$~flavors on the basis of the staggered fermion, the above $SU(12)$-breaking\nrelevant operator, if it exists, would be induced by the flavor-breaking effect\nof the staggered fermion and prevent an approach to an infrared fixed point.\nActual lattice simulations do not show such signs. Thus, assuming the absence\nof the above $SU(12)$-breaking relevant operator, we have an upper bound on the\nmass anomalous dimension at the fixed point~$\\gamma_m^*\\leq1.29$ from the\nrelation~$\\gamma_m^*=3-\\Delta_{\\phi_i^{\\Bar{k}}}$. Our upper bound is not so\nstrong practically but it is strict within the numerical accuracy. We also find\na kink-like behavior in the boundary curve for the scaling dimension of another\n$SU(12)$-breaking operator.\n", "  To learn about a physical system of interest, experimental results must be\nable to discriminate among models. We introduce a geometrical measure to\nquantify the distance between models for pseudoscalar-meson photoproduction in\namplitude space. Experimental observables, with finite accuracy, map to\nprobability distributions in amplitude space, and the characteristic width\nscale of such distributions needs to be smaller than the distance between\nmodels if the observable data are going to be useful. We therefore also\nintroduce a method for evaluating probability distributions in amplitude space\nthat arise as a result of one or more measurements, and show how one can use\nthis to determine what further measurements are going to be necessary to be\nable to discriminate among models.\n", "  Quantum communication has historically been at the forefront of advancements,\nfrom fundamental tests of quantum physics to utilizing the quantum-mechanical\nproperties of physical systems for practical applications. In the field of\ncommunication complexity, quantum communication allows the advantage of an\nexponential reduction in the information transmitted over classical\ncommunication to accomplish distributed computational tasks. However, to date,\ndemonstrating this advantage in a practical setting continues to be a central\nchallenge. Here, we report an experimental demonstration of a quantum\nfingerprinting protocol that for the first time surpasses the ultimate\nclassical limit to transmitted information. Ultra-low noise superconducting\nsingle-photon detectors and a stable fibre-based Sagnac interferometer are used\nto implement a quantum fingerprinting system that is capable of transmitting\nless information than the classical proven lower bound over 20 km standard\ntelecom fibre for input sizes of up to two Gbits. The results pave the way for\nexperimentally exploring the advanced features of quantum communication and\nopen a new window of opportunity for research in communication complexity and\ntesting the foundations of physics.\n", "  In this paper, based on the notion of Gauge/Gravity duality, we explore the\nlaws of entanglement thermodynamics for most generic classes of Quantum Field\nTheories with hyperscaling violation. In our analysis, we note that for Quantum\nField Theories with compressible \\textit{quark} like excitation, the first law\nof entanglement thermodynamics gets modified due to the presence of an\nadditional term that could be identified as the entanglement chemical potential\nassociated with \\textit{hidden} Fermi surfaces of the boundary theory. Most\nnotably, we find that the so called entanglement chemical potential does not\ndepend on the size of the entangling region and is purely determined by the\nquark d.o.f. encoded within the entangling region.\n", "  The four longest period Kuiper belt objects have orbital periods close to\ninteger ratios with each other. A hypothetical planet with orbital period\n$\\sim$17,117 years, semimajor axis $\\sim$665 AU, would have N/1 and N/2 period\nratios with these four objects. The orbital geometries and dynamics of resonant\norbits constrain the orbital plane, the orbital eccentricity and the mass of\nsuch a planet, as well as its current location in its orbital path.\n", "  To understand the nature of the $X(5568)$, recently observed in the mass\nspectrum of the $B_{s}^0\\pi^\\pm$ system by the D0 Collaboration, we have\ninvestigated, in a previous work, a scalar tetraquark (diquak-antidiquark)\nstructure for it, within the two-point QCD sum rules method. The result found\nfor its mass agrees well with the experimental value. Encouraged by this\nfinding we now extend our calculations to obtain the decay width of $X(5568)$\nto $B_{s}^0\\pi^\\pm$ using the three-point QCD sum rule. We obtain a value of\n$(20.4\\pm8.7)\\MeV$, which, on comparing with the experimental value of\n$21.9\\pm6.4 (\\mbox{sta})^{+5.0}_{-2.5}(\\mbox{syst}) \\MeV/c^2$, reinforces the\nscalar four quark nature of $X(5568)$.\n", "  Neutrino-atom scattering provides a sensitive tool for probing nonstandard\ninteractions of massive neutrinos in laboratory measurements. The ionization\nchannel of this collision process plays an important role in experiments\nsearching for neutrino magnetic moments. We discuss some theoretical aspects of\natomic ionization by massive neutrinos. We also outline possible manifestations\nof neutrino electromagnetic properties in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus\nscattering.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the interplay between geometry defects and\ntopological properties in bosonic symmetry protected topological(SPT) phases.\nWe start from eight copies of 3D time-reversal($\\mathcal{T}$) invariant\ntopological superconductors(TSC) on a crystal lattice. We melt the lattice by\ncondensation of disclinations and therefore restore the rotation symmetry. Such\ndisclination condensation procedure confines the fermion and afterwards turns\nthe system into a 3D boson topological liquid crystal(TCL). The low energy\neffective theory of this crystalline-liquid transition contains a topological\nterm inherited from the geometry axion response in TSC. In addition, we\ninvestigate the interplay between dislocation and superfluid vortex on the\nsurface of TCL. We demonstrate that the $\\mathcal{T}$ and translation invariant\nsurface state is a double $[e\\mathcal{T}m\\mathcal{T}]$ state with intrinsic\nsurface topological order. We also look into the exotic behavior of dislocation\nin 2D boson SPT state described by an $O(4)$ non-linear\n$\\sigma$-model(NL$\\sigma $M) with topological $\\Theta$-term. By dressing the\n$O(4)$ vector with spiral order and gauge the symmetry, the dislocation has\nmutual semion statistics with the gauge flux. Further reduce the $O(4)$\nNL$\\sigma M$ to the Ising limit, we arrive at the Levin-Gu model with stripy\nmodulation whose dislocation has nontrivial braiding statistics.\n", "  With only the tree level operator, the decay of $\\Lambda_b\\rightarrow pK$ is\npredicted to be one order smaller than the experimental data. The QCD penguin\neffects should be taken into account. In this paper, we explore the one-loop\nQCD corrections to the decay of $\\Lambda_b\\to pK$ within the framework of QCD\nfactorization approach. For the baryon system, the diquark approximation is\nadopted. The transition hadronic matrix elements between $\\Lambda_b$ and $p$\nare calculated in the light front quark model. The branching ratio of\n$\\Lambda_b\\rightarrow pK$ is predicted to be about $4.85\\times 10^{-6}$ which\nis consistent with experimental data $(4.9\\pm 0.9)\\times 10^{-6}$. The CP\nviolation is about 5\\% in theory.\n", "  Oxygen vacancy (VO) is a common native point defects that plays crucial roles\nin determining the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides such as\nZnO. However, fundamental understanding of VO is still very sparse.\nSpecifically, whether VO is mainly responsible for the n-type conductivity in\nZnO has been still unsettled in the past fifty years. Here we report on a study\nof oxygen self-diffusion by conceiving and growing oxygen-isotope ZnO\nheterostructures with delicately-controlled chemical potential and Fermi level.\nThe diffusion process is found to be predominantly mediated by VO. We further\ndemonstrate that, in contrast to the general belief of their neutral attribute,\nthe oxygen vacancies in ZnO are actually +2 charged and thus responsible for\nthe unintentional n-type conductivity as well as the non-stoichiometry of ZnO.\nThe methodology can be extended to study oxygen-related point defects and their\nenergetics in other technologically important oxide materials.\n", "  Using first-principles method and Boltzmann theory, we provide an accurate\nprediction of the electronic band structure and thermoelectric transport\nproperties of alpha-MgAgSb. Our calculations demonstrate that only when an\nappropriate exchange-correlation functional is chosen can we correctly\nreproduce the semiconducting nature of this compound. By fine tuning the\ncarrier concentration, the thermoelectric performance of alpha-MgAgSb can be\nsignificantly optimized, which exhibits a strong temperature dependence and\ngives a maximum ZT value of 1.7 at 550 K.\n", "  We experimentally investigated the splashing of dense suspension droplets\nimpacting a solid surface, extending prior work to the regime where the\nviscosity of the suspending liquid becomes a significant parameter. The overall\nbehavior can be described by a combination of two trends. The first one is that\nthe splashing becomes favored when the kinetic energy of individual particles\nat the surface of a droplet overcomes the confinement produced by surface\ntension. This is expressed by a particle-based Weber number $We_p$. The second\nis that splashing is suppressed by increasing the viscosity of the solvent.\nThis is expressed by the Stokes number $St$, which influences the effective\ncoefficient of restitution of colliding particles. We developed a phase diagram\nwhere the splashing onset is delineated as a function of both $We_p$ and $St$.\nA surprising result occurs at very small Stokes number, where not only\nsplashing is suppressed but also plastic deformation of the droplet. This leads\nto a situation where droplets can bounce back after impact, an observation we\nare able to reproduce using discrete particle numerical simulations that take\ninto account viscous interaction between particles and elastic energy.\n", "  The velocity-space distribution of alpha particles born in fusion devices is\nsubject to modification at moderate energies due to turbulent transport.\nTherefore, one must calculate the evolution of an equilibrium distribution\nwhose functional form is not known \\emph{a priori}. Using a novel technique,\napplicable to any trace impurity, we have made this calculation not only\npossible, but particularly efficient. We demonstrate a microturbulence-induced\ndeparture from the local slowing-down distribution, an inversion of the energy\ndistribution, and associated modifications to the alpha heating and pressure\nprofiles in an ITER-like scenario.\n", "  The possibility to construct and parametrize the nonbonded interactions in\natomistic force fields based on the valence electron structure of molecules is\nexplored in this paper. Three different charge distribution models using simple\nvalence electron based potential functions are introduced and compared. It is\nshown that the three models can be constructed such that they only require one\nadjustable parameter for the electrostatic potential of a molecule. The\naccuracy of the electrostatic potential is evaluated for the three models and\ncompared to population-derived charges and higher order multipole moments for a\nset of 12 small molecules. Furthermore the accuracy and parametrization of the\ninteraction energies of the three models is evaluated based on ab initio\nintermolecular interaction energies. It is shown that the valence electron\npotential models provide systematic advantages over conventional point charge\nmodels for the calculation of intermolecular interaction energies even with the\nvery simple potential functions used here.\n", "  The c-map of four dimensional non-linear theories of electromagnetism is\nconsidered both in the rigid case and in its coupling to gravity. In this way\ntheories with antisymmetric tensors and scalars are obtained, and the three\nnon-linear representations of N=2 supersymmetry partially broken to N=1\nrelated. The manifest $\\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ and $\\mathrm{U}(n)$ covariance of these\ntheories in their multifield extensions is also exhibited.\n", "  The momentum transfer between a photon and an object defines a fundamental\nlimit for the precision with which the object can be measured. If the object\noscillates at a frequency $\\Omega_0$, this measurement back-action adds quanta\n$\\hbar\\Omega_0$ to the oscillator's energy at a rate $\\Gamma_{\\rm recoil}$, a\nprocess called photon recoil heating, and sets bounds to quantum coherence\ntimes in cavity optomechanical systems. Here, we use an optically levitated\nnanoparticle in ultrahigh vacuum to directly measure $\\Gamma_{\\rm recoil}$. By\nmeans of a phase-sensitive feedback scheme, we cool the harmonic motion of the\nnanoparticle from ambient to micro-Kelvin temperatures and measure its\nreheating rate under the influence of the radiation field. The recoil heating\nrate is measured for different particle sizes and for different excitation\npowers, without the need for cavity optics or cryogenic environments. The\nmeasurements are in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and\nprovide valuable guidance for the realization of quantum ground-state cooling\nprotocols and the measurement of ultrasmall forces\n", "  The kinematic characterization of different galaxy populations is a key\nobservational input to distinguish between different galaxy evolutionary\nscenarios, since it helps to determine the number ratio of rotating disks to\nmergers at different cosmic epochs. Local (U)LIRGs offer a unique opportunity\nto study at high linear resolution and S/N extreme star forming events and\ncompare them with those observed at high-z. We obtained Very Large Telescope\n(VLT) VIMOS optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data of a sample of 38\n(U)LIRGs. The `unweighted' and `weighted' {kinemetry}-based methods are used to\nkinematically classify our galaxies in `disk' and `merger'. We simulate our\nsystems at z=3 to evaluate how a loss of angular resolution affects our\nresults. From the kinemetry-based analysis we are able classify our local\n(U)LIRGs in three distinct kinematic groups according to their total kinematic\nasymmetry values (K$_{tot}$) as derived when using the weighted (unweighted)\nmethod: 1) 25 out of 50 galaxies are kinematically classified as `disk', with a\nK$_{tot}\\leq$ 0.16 (0.14); 2) 9 out of 50 galaxies are kinematically classified\nas `merger', with a K$_{tot}\\geq$ 0.94 (0.66); 3) 16 out of 50 galaxies lie in\nthe `transition region', in which disks and mergers coexist, with 0.16 (0.14)\n$<$ K$_{tot}$ $<$ 0.94 (0.66). When we apply our criteria to the high-z\nsimulated systems, a lower total kinematic asymmetry frontier value (K$_{tot}$\n$\\sim$ 0.16 ($\\sim$ 0.14)) is derived with respect to that found locally. The\nloss of angular resolution smears out the kinematic features, thus making\nobjects to appear more kinematically regular than actually they are.\n", "  We study the infrared dynamics of low-energy atoms interacting with a sample\nof suspended graphene at finite temperature. The dynamics exhibits severe\ninfrared divergences order by order in perturbation theory as a result of the\nsingular nature of low-energy flexural phonon emission. Our model can be viewed\nas a two-channel generalization of the independent boson model with asymmetric\natom-phonon coupling. This allows us to take advantage of the exact\nnon-perturbative solution of the independent boson model in the stronger\nchannel while treating the weaker one perturbatively. In the low-energy limit,\nthe exact solution can be viewed as a resummation (exponentiation) of the most\ndivergent diagrams in the perturbative expansion. As a result of this\nprocedure, we obtain the atom's Green function which we use to calculate the\natom damping rate, a quantity equal to the quantum sticking rate. A\ncharacteristic feature of our results is that the Green's function retains a\nweak, infrared cutoff dependence that reflects the reduced dimensionality of\nthe problem. As a consequence, we predict a measurable dependence of the\nsticking rate on graphene sample size. We provide detailed predictions for the\nsticking rate of atomic hydrogen as a function of temperature and sample size.\nThe resummation yields an enhanced sticking rate relative to the conventional\nFermi golden rule result (equivalent to the one-loop atom self-energy), as\nhigher-order processes increase damping at finite temperature.\n", "  We present a novel reconfigurable metal-oxide-semiconductor multi-gate\ntransistor that can host a quadruple quantum dot in silicon. The device consist\nof an industrial quadruple-gate silicon nanowire field-effect transistor.\nExploiting the corner effect, we study the versatility of the structure in the\nsingle quantum dot and the serial double quantum dot regimes and extract the\nrelevant capacitance parameters. We address the fabrication variability of the\nquadruple-gate approach which, paired with improved silicon fabrication\ntechniques, makes the corner state quantum dot approach a promising candidate\nfor a scalable quantum information architecture.\n", "  We provide a method for estimating spectral gaps in low-dimensional systems.\nUnlike traditional phase estimation, our approach does not require ancillary\nqubits nor does it require well characterised gates. Instead, it only requires\nthe ability to perform approximate Haar-random unitary operations, applying the\nunitary whose eigenspectrum is sought out and performing measurements in the\ncomputational basis. We discuss application of these ideas to in-place\namplitude estimation and quantum device calibration.\n", "  We develop a frame-covariant formulation of inflation in the slow-roll\napproximation by generalizing the inflationary attractor solution for\nscalar-curvature theories. Our formulation gives rise to new generalized forms\nfor the potential slow-roll parameters, which enable us to examine the effect\nof conformal transformations and inflaton reparameterizations in\nscalar-curvature theories. We find that cosmological observables, such as the\npower spectrum, the spectral indices and their runnings, can be expressed in a\nconcise manner in terms of the generalized potential slow-roll parameters which\ndepend on the scalar-curvature coupling function, the inflaton wavefunction,\nand the inflaton potential. We show how the cosmological observables of\ninflation are frame-invariant in this generalized potential slow-roll\nformalism, as long as the end-of-inflation condition is appropriately extended\nto become frame-invariant as well. We then apply our formalism to specific\nscenarios, such as the induced gravity inflation, Higgs inflation and $F(R)$\nmodels of inflation, and obtain more accurate results, without making\nadditional approximations to the potential. Our results are shown to be\nconsistent to lowest order with those presented in the literature. Finally, we\noutline how our frame-covariant formalism can be naturally extended beyond the\ntree-level approximation, within the framework of the Vilkovisky--DeWitt\neffective action.\n", "  There are 15 cataclysmic variables (CVs) observed in the first two campaigns\nof the K2 mission. In this paper, the eight CVs showing distinct features are\nanalyzed in detail. Among these eight, modulations during quiescence are\nevident at the known orbital periods in the SU UMa stars QZ Vir and RZ Leo, and\nat our newly determined orbital periods of 1RXS J0632+2536 and WD 1144+011. The\nperiodogram analysis for the quiescent light curve of QZ Vir reveals\nmulti-period modulations and the coexistence of orbital and superhump periods.\nThe phased orbital light curves for the other 3 CVs in quiescence display wide\n(about half cycle) and shallow (< 0.5 mag) eclipse features. Besides these\nmodulations, their quiescent light curves reveal several transient events: a\nsudden decrease of system light in 1RXS J0632+2536, a low level flare-like\nevent in QZ Vir, a short brightening event in RZ Leo and a temporary\ndisappearance of the orbital modulation in WD 1144+011. The two known dwarf\nnovae UV Gem and TW Vir and the CVs USNO-B1.01144-00115322 and\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807 show outbursts, including 1 complete and 3 incomplete\nnormal outbursts and 2 complete superoutbursts. An incomplete but typical\nnormal outburst confirms the dwarf nova identification of the\nUSNO-B1.01144-00115322. The one complete normal outburst in UV Gem possibly\nprovides the orbital period, since its modulations are shorter than the\npreviously observed superhump period. The superoutbursts of TW Vir and\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807, along with their corresponding superhump periods,\nindicate that both objects are SU UMa stars. The derived superhump period of\nCSS130516:111236.7+002807 is 1.44 hr, implying that this new SU UMa star is\nclose to the period minimum.\n", "  In non-Kramers Kondo systems with a quadrupolar degrees of freedom, an\nordinary magnetic Kondo effect can compete with the quadrupolar Kondo effect.\nWe discuss such competition keeping Pr$T_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ ($T$=Ir, Rh) and\nPr$T_{2}$Al$_{20}$ ($T$=V, Ti) in mind, where the $\\Gamma_{3}$ non-Kramers\ncrystalline-electric-field (CEF) doublet ground state is realized in Pr$^{3+}$\nion with $(4f)^{2}$ configuration under cubic symmetry. The quadrupolar Kondo\neffect can be described by the two-channel Kondo model, which leads to the\nlocal non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) ground state, while the magnetic Kondo effect\nfavors the ordinary local Fermi-liquid (FL) ground state. Based on the minimal\nextended two-channel Kondo model including the magnetic Kondo coupling as well,\nwe investigate the competition and resulting thermodynamics, and\norbital/magnetic, and single-particle excitation spectra by the Wilson's\nnumerical renormalization-group (NRG) method. There exists the first-order\ntransition between the NFL and FL ground states. In addition to these two\nstates, the alternative FL state accompanied by a free magnetic spin appears in\nintermediate temperature range, which eventually reaches the true NFL ground\nstate, as a consequence of stronger competition between the magnetic and\nquadrupolar Kondo effects. In this peculiar state, the magnetic susceptibility\nshows a Curie-like behavior, while the orbital fluctuation exhibits the FL\nbehavior. Moreover, the single-particle spectra yield a more singular behavior.\nImplications to the Pr 1-2-20 systems are briefly discussed.\n", "  Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) are essential to many technologies.\nThese materials are doped (\\emph{n}- or \\emph{p}-type) oxides with a large\nenough band gap (ideally $>$3~eV) to ensure transparency. However, the high\ncarrier concentration present in TCOs lead additionally to the possibility for\noptical transitions from the occupied conduction bands to higher states for\n\\emph{n}-type materials and from lower states to the unoccupied valence bands\nfor \\emph{p}-type TCOs. The \"second gap\" formed by these transitions might\nlimit transparency and a large second gap has been sometimes proposed as a\ndesign criteria for high performance TCOs. Here, we study the influence of this\nsecond gap on optical absorption using \\emph{ab initio} computations for\nseveral well-known \\emph{n}- and \\emph{p}-type TCOs. Our work demonstrates that\nmost known \\emph{n}-type TCOs do not suffer from second gap absorption in the\nvisible even at very high carrier concentrations. On the contrary,\n\\emph{p}-type oxides show lowering of their optical transmission for high\ncarrier concentrations due to second gap effects. We link this dissimilarity to\nthe different chemistries involved in \\emph{n}- versus typical \\emph{p}-type\nTCOs. Quantitatively, we show that second gap effects lead to only moderate\nloss of transmission (even in p-type TCOs) and suggest that a wide second gap,\nwhile beneficial, should not be considered as a needed criteria for a working\nTCO.\n", "  The uniform electron gas and the hydrogen atom play fundamental roles in\ncondensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. The former has an infinite\nnumber of electrons uniformly distributed over the neutralizing\npositively-charged background, and the latter only one electron bound to the\nproton. The uniform electron gas was used to derive the local spin density\napproximation (LSDA) to the exchange-correlation functional that undergirds the\ndevelopment of the Kohn-Sham density functional theory. We show here that the\nground-state exchange-correlation energies of the hydrogen atom and many other\n1- and 2-electron systems are modeled surprisingly well by a different local\nspin density approximation (LSDA0). Our LSDA0 is constructed to satisfy exact\nconstraints, but agrees surprisingly well with the exact results for a uniform\ntwo-electron density in a finite, curved three-dimensional space. We also apply\nLSDA0 to excited or noded 1-electron densities. Furthermore, we show that the\nlocality of an orbital can be measured by the ratio between the exact exchange\nenergy and its optimal lower bound.\n", "  The aLIGO detection of the black-hole binary GW150914 opened a new era for\nprobing extreme gravity. Many gravity theories predict the emission of dipole\ngravitational radiation by binaries. This is excluded to high accuracy in\nbinary pulsars, but entire classes of theories predict this effect\npredominantly (or only) in binaries involving black holes. Joint observations\nof GW150914-like systems by aLIGO and eLISA will improve bounds on dipole\nemission from black-hole binaries by six orders of magnitude relative to\ncurrent constraints, provided that eLISA is not dramatically descoped.\n", "  We demonstrate multiple photon cycling and radiative force deflection on the\ntriatomic free radical strontium monohydroxide (SrOH). Optical cycling is\nachieved on SrOH in a cryogenic buffer-gas beam by employing the rotationally\nclosed $P\\left(N''=1\\right)$ branch of the vibronic transition\n$\\tilde{X}^{2}\\Sigma^{+}\\left(000\\right)\\leftrightarrow\\tilde{A}^{2}\\Pi_{1/2}\\left(000\\right)$.\nA single repumping laser excites the Sr-O stretching vibrational mode, and\nphoton cycling of the molecule deflects the SrOH beam by an angle of\n$0.2^{\\circ}$ via scattering of $\\sim100$ photons per molecule. This approach\ncan be used for direct laser cooling of SrOH and more complex, isoelectronic\nspecies.\n", "  Previous studies of the initial conditions of massive star formation have\nmainly targeted Infrared-Dark Clouds (IRDCs) toward the inner Galaxy. This is\ndue to the fact that IRDCs were first detected in absorption against the bright\nmid-IR background, requiring a favourable location to be observed. By\nselection, IRDCs represent only a fraction of the Galactic clouds capable of\nforming massive stars and star clusters. Due to their low dust temperatures,\nIRDCs are bright in the far-IR and millimeter and thus, observations at these\nwavelengths have the potential to provide a complete sample of star-forming\nmassive clouds across the Galaxy. Our aim is to identify the clouds at the\ninitial conditions of massive star formation across the Galaxy and compare\ntheir physical properties as a function of their Galactic location. We have\nexamined the physical properties of a homogeneous galactic cold core sample\nobtained with the Planck satellite across the Galactic Plane. With the use of\nHerschel Hi-GAL observations, we have characterized the internal structure of\nthem. By using background-subtracted Herschel images, we have derived the H2\ncolumn density and dust temperature maps for 48 Planck clumps. Their basic\nphysical parameters have been calculated and analyzed as a function of location\nwithin the Galaxy. These properties have also been compared with the empirical\nrelation for massive star formation derived by Kauffmann & Pillai (2010). Most\nof the Planck clumps contain signs of star formation. About 25% of them are\nmassive enough to form high mass stars. Planck clumps toward the Galactic\ncenter region show higher peak column densities and higher average dust\ntemperatures than those of the clumps in the outer Galaxy. Although we only\nhave seven clumps without associated YSOs, the Hi-GAL data show no apparent\ndifferences in the properties of Planck cold clumps with and without star\nformation.\n", "  We investigate joint low-latency gravitational wave (GW) detection and prompt\nelectromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations of coalescing binary neutron stars\n(BNSs). Assuming that BNS mergers are associated with short duration gamma ray\nbursts (SGRBs), we evaluate if rapid EM follow-ups can capture the prompt\nemission, early engine activity or reveal any potential by-products such as\nmagnetars or fast radio bursts. To examine the expected performance of extreme\nlow-latency search pipelines, we simulate a population of coalescing BNSs and\nuse these to estimate the detectability and localisation efficiency at\ndifferent times before merger. Using observational SGRB flux data corrected to\nthe range of the advanced GW interferometric detectors, we determine what EM\nobservations could be achieved from low-frequency radio up to high energy\n$\\gamma$-ray. We show that while challenging, breakthrough multi-messenger\nscience is possible through low latency pipelines.\n", "  The interaction of high intensity laser radiation with mass-limited target\nexhibits significant enhancement of the ion acceleration when the target is\nsurrounded by an underdense plasma corona, as seen in numerical simulations.\nThe self-generated quasistatic magnetic field squeezes the corona causing the\nintensification of a subsequent Coulomb explosion of the target. The electric\nfield intensification at the target edges and plasma resonance effects result\nin the generation of characteristic density holes and further contributes to\nthe ion acceleration.The interaction of high intensity laser radiation with\nmass-limited target exhibits significant enhancement of the ion acceleration\nwhen the target is surrounded by an underdense plasma corona, as seen in\nnumerical simulations.

The electric field intensification at the target edges and plasma\nresonance effects result in the generation of characteristic density holes and\nfurther contributes to the ion acceleration.\n", "  A diphoton excess with an invariant mass of about 750 GeV has been recently\nreported by both ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC. While the simplest\ninterpretation requires the resonant production of a 750 GeV (pseudo)scalar,\nhere we consider an alternative setup, with an additional heavy parent particle\nwhich decays into a pair of 750 GeV resonances. This configuration improves the\nagreement between the 8 TeV and 13 TeV data. Moreover, we include a dark matter\ncandidate in the form of a Majorana fermion which interacts through the 750 GeV\nportal. The invisible decays of the light resonance help to suppress additional\ndecay channels into Standard Model particles in association with the diphoton\nsignal. We realise our hierarchical framework in the context of an effective\ntheory, and we analyse the diphoton signal as well as the consistency with\nother LHC searches. We finally address the interplay of the LHC results with\nthe dark matter phenomenology, namely the compatibility with the relic density\nabundance and the indirect detection bounds.\n", "  We present the results of a survey to detect low-mass companions of UMa group\nmembers, carried out in 2003-2006 with NACO at the ESO VLT. While many\nextra-solar planets and planetary candidates have been found in close orbits\naround stars by the radial velocity and the transit method, direct detections\nat wider orbits are rare. The Ursa Major (UMa) group, a young stellar\nassociation at an age of about 200-600 Myr and an average distance of 25 pc,\nhas not yet been addressed as a whole although its members represent a very\ninteresting sample to search for and characterize sub-stellar companions by\ndirect imaging. Our goal was to find or to provide detection limits on wide\nsub-stellar companions around nearby UMa group members using high-resolution\nimaging. We searched for faint companions around 20 UMa group members within 30\npc. The primaries were placed below a semi-transparent coronagraph, a rather\nrarely used mode of NACO, to increase the dynamic range of the images. In most\ncases, second epoch images of companion candidates were taken to check whether\nthey share common proper motion with the primary. Our coronagraphic images rule\nout sub-stellar companions around the stars of the sample. A dynamical range of\ntypically 13-15 mag in the Ks band was achieved at separations beyond 3\" from\nthe star. Candidates as faint as Ks ~ 20 were securely identified and measured.\nThe survey is most sensitive between separations of 100 and 200 au but only on\naverage because of the very different target distance. Field coverage reaches\nabout 650 au for the most distant targets. Most of the 200 candidates are\nvisible in two epochs. All of those were rejected being distant background\nobjects.\n", "  We study a three loop induced neutrino mass model with exotic vector-like\nisospin doublet leptons which contain a dark matter candidate. Then we explore\nlepton flavor violations, and dark matter physics in co-annihilation system. In\nthis paper the nearly degenerate Majorana fermion dark matter can naturally be\nachieved at the two loop level, while the mass splitting can be larger than\n${\\cal O}$(200) keV which is required from the constraint of the direct\ndetection search with spin independent inelastic scattering through $Z$ boson\nportal. As a result a monochromatic photon excess, its threshold energy is\ngreater than ${\\cal O}$(200) keV, is predicted in our model that could be\nmeasured through indirect detection experiments such as INTEGRAL.\n", "  Background: The deformation of the nuclei involved in the cluster decay of\nheavy nuclei affect seriously their half-lives against the decay. Purpose: We\ninvestigate the description of the different decay stages in both the optimum\norientation and the orientation-averaged pictures of the cluster decay process.\nMethod: We consider the decays of 232,233,234U and 236,238Pu isotopes. The\nquantum mechanical knocking frequency and penetration probability based on the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation are used to find the decay width.\nResults: We found that the orientation-averaged decay width is one or two\norders of magnitude less than its value along the non-compact optimum\norientation. The difference between the two values increases with decreasing\nthe mass number of the emitted cluster. Correspondingly, the extracted\npreformation probability based on the averaged decay width increases with the\nsame orders of magnitude compared to its value obtained considering the optimum\norientation. The cluster preformation probabilities (Sc) obtained in the two\nconsidered schemes give more or less comparable agreement with the\nBlendowske-Walliser (BW) formula based on the preformation probability of\nSa(ave.) obtained from the orientation-averaging scheme. All the obtained\nresults, including those obtained in the optimum-orientation scheme, deviate\nsubstantially from the BW law based on Sa(opt.) obtained using the\noptimum-orientation scheme. Conclusion: In order to account for deformations of\nthe participating nuclei, it is more relevant to calculate the decay width by\naveraging over the different possible orientations of the participating\ndeformed nucleus, rather than considering the corresponding non-compact optimum\norientation.\n", "  Myosin motor proteins drive vigorous steady-state fluctuations in the actin\ncytoskeleton of cells. Endogenous embedded semiflexible filaments such as\nmicrotubules, or added filaments such as single-walled carbon nanotubes are\nused as novel tools to non-invasively track equilibrium and non-equilibrium\nfluctuations in such biopolymer networks. Here we analytically calculate shape\nfluctuations of semiflexible probe filaments in a viscoelastic environment,\ndriven out of equilibrium by motor activity. Transverse bending fluctuations of\nthe probe filaments can be decomposed into dynamic normal modes. We find that\nthese modes no longer evolve independently under non-equilibrium driving. This\neffective mode coupling results in non-zero circulatory currents in a\nconformational phase space, reflecting a violation of detailed balance. We\npresent predictions for the characteristic frequencies associated with these\ncurrents and investigate how the temporal signatures of motor activity\ndetermine mode correlations, which we find to be consistent with recent\nexperiments on microtubules embedded in cytoskeletal networks.\n", "  We extend the duality of Kipnis Marchioro and Presutti to inhomogeneous\nlattice gas systems where either the components have different degrees of\nfreedom or the rate of interaction depends on the spatial location. Then the\ndual process is applied to prove local equilibrium in the hydrodynamic limit\nfor some inhomogeneous high dimensional systems andin the nonequilibrium steady\nstate for one dimensional systems with arbitrary inhomogeneity.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of nuclear gas-phase oxygen abundance and star\nformation rate (SFR) of local far-infrared selected star-forming galaxies along\nthe merger sequence, as traced by their optical morphologies. The sample was\ndrawn from a cross-correlation analysis of the IRAS Point Source Catalog\nRedshift Survey and 1 Jy ultraluminous infrared galaxies sample with the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 7 database. The investigation is done by\ncomparing our sample to a control sample matched in the normalized redshift\ndistribution in two diagnostics, which are the nuclear gas-phase metallicity\nvs. stellar mass and the nuclear SFR vs. stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with\ndifferent morphological types show different mass-metallicity relations (MZR).\nCompared to the MZR defined by the control sample, isolated spirals have\ncomparable metallicities with the control sample at a given stellar mass.\nSpirals in pairs and interacting galaxies with projected separations $r_{p} >$\n20 kpc show mild metallicity dilution of 0.02-0.03 dex. Interacting galaxies\nwith $r_{p} <$ 20 kpc, pre-mergers and advanced mergers are under-abundant by\n~0.06, ~0.05 and ~0.04 dex, respectively. This shows an evolutionary trend that\nthe metallicity is increasingly depressed as the merging proceeds and it is\ndiluted most dramatically when two galaxies are closely interacting.\nAfterwards, the interstellar medium (ISM) is enriched when the galaxies\ncoalesce. This is the first time that such ISM enrichment at the final\ncoalescence stage is observed, which demonstrates the importance of supernova\nexplosion in affecting the nuclear metallicity. Meanwhile the central SFR\nenhancement relative to the control sample evolves simultaneously with the\nnuclear gas-phase oxygen abundance. Our results support the predictions from\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Classical MHD reconnection theories, both the stationary Sweet-Parker model\nand the tearing instability, are known to provide rates which are too slow to\nexplain the observations. However, a recent analysis has shown that there\nexists a critical threshold on current sheet's thickness, namely a/L~S^(-1/3),\nbeyond which the tearing modes evolve on fast macroscopic Alfvenic timescales,\nprovided the Lunquist number S is high enough, as invariably found in solar and\nastrophysical plasmas. Therefore, the classical Sweet-Parker scenario, for\nwhich the diffusive region scales as a/L~S^(-1/2) and thus can be up to ~100\ntimes thinner than the critical value, is likely to be never realized in\nnature, as the current sheet itself disrupts in the elongation process. We\npresent here two-dimensional, compressible, resistive MHD simulations, with S\nranging from 10^5 to 10^7, that fully confirm the linear analysis. Moreover, we\nshow that a secondary plasmoid instability always occurs when the same critical\nscaling is reached on the local, smaller scale, leading to a cascading\nexplosive process, reminiscent of the flaring activity.\n", "  We develop a method for computing Mellin moments of single inclusive cross\nsections such as Drell-Yan production directly from forward scattering\ndiagrams, by invoking unitarity in the form of cutting equations. We provide a\ndiagram-independent prescription for eliminating contributions from unwanted\ncuts at the level of an expansion in the reciprocal omega=1/z variable. The\nmodified sum over powers of omega produces the result from physical cuts only,\nwith the nth coefficient precisely equal to the nth Mellin moment of the cross\nsection. We demonstrate and validate our method for representative one- and\ntwo-loop diagrams.\n", "  Acoustic signals generated by filamentation of ultrashort TW laser pulses in\nwater are characterized experimentally. Measurements reveal a strong influence\nof input pulse duration on the shape and intensity of the acoustic wave.\nNumerical simulations of the laser pulse nonlinear propagation and the\nsubsequent water hydrodynamics and acoustic wave generation show that the\nstrong acoustic emission is related to the mechanism of superfilamention in\nwater. The elongated shape of the plasma volume where energy is deposited\ndrives the far-field profile of the acoustic signal, which takes the form of a\nradially directed pressure wave with a single oscillation and a very broad\nspectrum.\n", "  We re-investigate electroweak signal-background interference in associated\nHiggs production via gluon fusion in the presence of new physics in the\ntop-Higgs sector. Considering the full final state $pp \\to b \\bar b\n\\ell^+\\ell^-$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$), we discuss how new physics in the top-Higgs\nsector that enhances the $ZZ$ component can leave footprints in the $HZ$ limit\nsetting. In passing we investigate the phenomenology of a class of new physics\ninteractions that can be genuinely studied in this process.\n", "  Nonlinear plastic modes (NPMs) are collective displacements that are\nindicative of imminent plastic instabilities in elastic solids. In this work we\nformulate the atomistic theory that describes the reversible evolution of NPMs\nand their associated stiffnesses under external deformations. The\ndeformation-dynamics of NPMs is compared to those of the analogous observables\nderived from atomistic linear elastic theory, namely destabilizing eigenmodes\nof the dynamical matrix and their associated eigenvalues. The key result we\npresent and explain is that the dynamics of NPMs and of destabilizing\neigenmodes under external deformations follow different scaling laws with\nrespect to the proximity to imminent instabilities. In particular,\ndestabilizing modes vary with a singular rate, whereas NPMs' exhibit no such\nsingularity. As a result, NPMs converge much earlier than destabilizing\neigenmodes to their common final form at plastic instabilities. This dynamical\ndifference between NPMs and linear destabilizing eigenmodes underlines the\nusefulness of NPMs for predicting the locus and geometry of plastic\ninstabilities, compared to their linear-elastic counterparts.\n", "  We investigate the effect of an electrical current on the attenuation length\nof a 900 nm wavelength spin-wave in a permalloy/Pt bilayer using propagating\nspin-wave spectroscopy. The modification of the spin-wave relaxation rate is\nlinear in current density, reaching up to 14% for a current density of\n2.3$\\times10^{11} $A/m$^2$ in Pt. This change is attributed to the spin\ntransfer torque induced by the spin Hall effect and corresponds to an effective\nspin Hall angle of 0.13, which is among the highest values reported so far. The\nspin Hall effect thus appears as an efficient way of amplifying/attenuating\npropagating spin waves.\n", "  We present results from X-ray observations of the gravitationally lensed z =\n1.51 AGN HS 0810+2554 performed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and\nXMM-Newton. Blueshifted absorption lines are detected in both observations at\nrest-frame energies ranging between ~1-12 keV at > 99% confidence. The inferred\nvelocities of the outflowing components range between ~0.1c and ~0.4c. A strong\nemission line at ~6.8 keV accompanied by a significant absorption line at ~7.8\nkeV is also detected in the Chandra observation. The presence of these lines is\na characteristic feature of a P-Cygni profile supporting the presence of an\nexpanding outflowing highly ionized iron absorber in this quasar. Modeling of\nthe P-Cygni profile constrains the covering factor of the wind to be > 0.6,\nassuming disk shielding. A disk-reflection component is detected in the\nXMM-Newton observation accompanied by blueshifted absorption lines. The\nXMM-Newton observation constrains the inclination angle to be < 45 degrees at\n90% confidence, assuming the hard excess is due to blurred reflection from the\naccretion disk. The detection of an ultrafast and wide-angle wind in an AGN\nwith intrinsic narrow absorption lines (NALs) would suggest that quasar winds\nmay couple efficiently with the intergalactic medium and provide significant\nfeedback if ubiquitous in all NAL and BAL quasars. We estimate the mass-outflow\nrate of the absorbers to lie in the range of 1.5 and 3.4 Msolar/yr for the two\nobservations. We find the fraction of kinetic to electromagnetic luminosity\nreleased by HS 0810+2554 is large (epsilon = 9 (-6,+8)) suggesting that\nmagnetic driving is likely a significant contributor to the acceleration of\nthis outflow.\n", "  A poromechanical model of partially saturated deformable porous media is\nproposed based on a phase field approach at modeling the behavior of the\nmixture of liquid water and wet air, which saturates the pore space, the phase\nfield being the saturation (ratio). While the standard retention curve is\nexpected still to provide the intrinsic retention properties of the porous\nskeleton, depending on the porous texture, an enhanced description of surface\ntension between the wetting (liquid water) and the non-wetting (wet air) fluid,\noccupying the pore space, is stated considering a regularization of the phase\nfield model based on an additional contribution to the overall free energy\ndepending on the saturation gradient. The aim is to provide a more refined\ndescription of surface tension interactions.\n  An enhanced constitutive relation for the capillary pressure is established\ntogether with a suitable generalization of Darcy's law, in which the gradient\nof the capillary pressure is replaced by the gradient of the so-called\ngeneralized chemical potential, which also accounts for the \\lq\\lq\nforce\\rq\\rq\\, associated to the local free energy of the phase field model. A\nmicro-scale heuristic interpretation of the novel constitutive law of capillary\npressure is proposed, in order to compare the envisaged model with that one\nendowed with the concept of average interfacial area.\n  The considered poromechanical model is formulated within the framework of\nstrain gradient theory in order to account for possible effects, at laboratory\nscale, of the micro-scale hydro-mechanical couplings between highly-localized\nflows (fingering) and localized deformations of the skeleton (fracturing).\n", "  We use an extensive suite of numerical simulations to constrain the mass and\norbit of Planet Nine, the recently proposed perturber in a distant eccentric\norbit in the outer solar system. We compare our simulations to the observed\npopulation of aligned eccentric high semimajor axis Kuiper belt objects and\ndetermine which simulation parameters are statistically compatible with the\nobservations. We find that only a narrow range of orbital elements can\nreproduce the observations. In particular, the combination of semimajor axis,\neccentricity, and mass of Planet Nine strongly dictates the semimajor axis\nrange of the orbital confinement of the distant eccentric Kuiper belt objects.\nAllowed orbits, which confine Kuiper belt objects with semimajor axis beyond\n380~AU, have perihelia roughly between 150 and 350~AU, semimajor axes between\n380 and 980~AU, and masses between 5 and 20 Earth masses. Orbitally confined\nobjects also generally have orbital planes similar to that of the planet,\nsuggesting that the planet is inclined approximately 30~degrees to the\necliptic. We compare the allowed orbital positions and estimated brightness of\nPlanet Nine to previous and ongoing surveys which would be sensitive to the\nplanet's detection and use these surveys to rule out approximately two-thirds\nof the planet's orbit. Planet Nine is likely near aphelion with an approximate\nbrightness of $22<V<25$. At opposition, its motion, mainly due to parallax, can\neasily be detected within 24 hours.\n", "  $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, that is, a combined parity and time-reversal\nsymmetry is a key milestone for non-Hermite systems exhibiting entirely real\neigenenergy. In the present work, motivated by a recent experiment, we study\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum\nwalks. We present the explicit definition of $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by\nemploying a concept of symmetry time frames. We provide a necessary and\nsufficient condition so that the time-evolution operator of the non-unitary\nquantum walk retains $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model\ndepend on position. It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded\nin the time-evolution operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the\nnon-unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.\n", "  In this work we focus on the technical details of the numerical simulations\nof the non- thermal transient Swift J1644+57, whose emission is probably\nproduced by a two-component jet powered by a tidal disruption event. In this\ncontext we provide details of the coupling between the relativistic\nhydrodynamic simulations and the radiative transfer code. First, we consider\nthe technical demands of one-dimensional simulations of a fast relativistic\njet, and show to what extent (for the same physical parameters of the model) do\nthe computed light curves depend on the numerical parameters of the different\ncodes employed. In the second part we explain the difficulties of computing\nlight curves from axisymmetric two dimensonal simulations and discuss a\nprocedure that yields an acceptable tradeoff between the computational cost and\nthe quality of the results.\n", "  Non-Decoupling D-Terms are an attractive possibility to enhance the\ntree-level mass of the standard model like Higgs boson in supersymmetric\nmodels. We discuss here for the case of a new Abelian gauge group two effects\nusually neglected in literature: (i) the size of the additional radiative\ncorrections to the Higgs mass due to the presence of the new gauge coupling,\nand (ii) the impact of gauge kinetic mixing. It is shown that both effects\nreduce to some extent the positive effect of the non-decoupling D-terms on the\nHiggs mass.\n", "  Magnetic properties of dirty multiband superconductors near the upper\ncritical field are studied. The parameter $\\kappa_2$ characterizing\nmagnetization slope is shown to have a significant temperature variation which\nis quite sensitive to the pairing interactions and relative strengths of\nintraband impurity scattering. In contrast to single-band superconductors the\nincrease of $\\kappa_2$ at low temperatures can be arbitrary large determined by\nthe ratio of minimal and maximal diffusion coefficients in different bands.\nTemperature dependencies of $\\kappa_2(T)$ in two-band MgB$_2$ and iron-based\nsuperconductors are shown to be much more sensitive to the multiband effects\nthan the upper critical field $H_{c2}(T)$.\n", "  A right triangular billiard system is equivalent to the system of two\ncolliding particles confined in a one-dimensional box. In spite of their\nseeming simplicity, no definite conclusion has been drawn so far concerning\ntheir ergodic properties. To answer this question, we transform the dynamics of\nthe right triangular billiard system to a piecewise map and analytically prove\nthe broken ergodicity. The mechanism leading to the broken ergodicity is\ndiscussed, and some numerical evidence corroborating our conclusion is\nprovided.\n", "  We discuss the possibility that dark matter corresponds to an oscillating\nscalar field coupled to the Higgs boson. We argue that the initial field\namplitude should generically be of the order of the Hubble parameter during\ninflation, as a result of its quasi-de Sitter fluctuations. This implies that\nsuch a field may account for the present dark matter abundance for masses in\nthe range $10^{-6} - 10^{-4}$ eV, if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is within the\nrange of planned CMB experiments. We show that such mass values can naturally\nbe obtained through either Planck-suppressed non-renormalizable interactions\nwith the Higgs boson or, alternatively, through renormalizable interactions\nwithin the Randall-Sundrum scenario, where the dark matter scalar resides in\nthe bulk of the warped extra-dimension and the Higgs is confined to the\ninfrared brane.\n", "  Since twenty years, a large population of close-in planets orbiting various\nclasses of low-mass stars (from M to A-type stars) has been discovered. In such\nsystems, the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star\nmay modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the\nsurrounding planetary system. In this context, recent works demonstrated that\nthe amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as\na function of stellar mass, age and rotation. In addition, the stellar rotation\nevolution strongly impacts angular momentum exchanges within star-planet\nsystems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and\nrotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets. The presence of planets may also modify the rotation of the host stars\nand as a consequence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing. In this\nwork, we present the first study of the dynamics of close-in planets of various\nmasses orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6$ to $1.2~M_\\star$) where we compute\nthe simultaneous evolution of the star's structure, rotation and tidal\ndissipation in its external convective enveloppe. We find that tidal friction\ndue to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the\nconvection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of\nthe equilibrium tide, especially during the PMS phase. Consequently, the\norbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the\nstellar mass, rotation and age. This would very weakly affect the planets in\nthe habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that\nstellar tide-induced migration happens on very long timescales. We also\ndemonstrate that the rotational evolution of host stars is only weakly affected\nby the presence of planets except for massive companions.\n", "  Background: Measurements of polarization observables for the reactions\n$\\vec{\\gamma} p \\rightarrow K^+ \\Lambda$ and $\\vec{\\gamma} p \\rightarrow K^+\n\\Sigma^0$ have been performed. This is part of a programme of measurements\ndesigned to study the spectrum of baryon resonances.\n  Purpose: The accurate measurement of several polarization observables\nprovides tight constraints for phenomenological fits. Beam-recoil observables\nfor the $\\vec{\\gamma} p \\rightarrow K^+ \\Sigma^0$ reaction have not been\nreported before now.\n  Method: The measurements were carried out using linearly polarized photon\nbeams and the CLAS detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator\nFacility. The energy range of the results is 1.71\\,GeV $<W<$ 2.19\\,GeV, with an\nangular range $-0.75 < \\cos\\theta^{\\star}_K < +0.85$.\n  Results: The observables extracted for both reactions are beam asymmetry\n$\\Sigma$, target asymmetry $T$, and the beam-recoil double polarization\nobservables $O_x$ and $O_z$.\n  Conclusions: Comparison with theoretical fits indicates that in the regions\nwhere no previous data existed, the new data contain significant new\ninformation, and strengthen the evidence for the set of resonances used in the\nlatest Bonn-Gatchina fit.\n", "  We study the disordered Heisenberg spin chain, which exhibits many body\nlocalization at strong disorder, in the weak to moderate disorder regime. A\ncontinued fraction calculation of dynamical correlations is devised, using a\nvariational extrapolation of recurrents. Good convergence for the infinite\nchain limit is shown. We find that the local spin correlations decay at long\ntimes as $C \\sim t^{-\\beta}$, while the conductivity exhibits a low frequency\npower law $\\sigma \\sim \\omega^{\\alpha}$. The exponents depict sub-diffusive\nbehavior $ \\beta < 1/2, \\alpha> 0 $ at all finite disorders, and convergence to\nthe scaling result, $\\alpha+2\\beta = 1$, at large disorders.\n", "  We study the free energy of a static quark in QCD with 2+1 flavors in a wide\ntemperature region, 116 MeV $< T < $ 5814 MeV, using the highly improved\nstaggered quark (HISQ) action. We analyze the transition region in detail,\nobtain the entropy of a static quark, show that it peaks at temperatures close\nto the chiral crossover temperature and also revisit the temperature dependence\nof the Polyakov loop susceptibilities using gradient flow. We discuss the\nimplications of our findings for the deconfinement and chiral crossover\nphenomena at physical values of the quark masses. Finally a comparison of the\nlattice results at high temperatures with the weak-coupling calculations is\npresented.\n", "  We present time-resolved transport measurements of a Wigner solid (WS) on the\nsurface of liquid Helium confined in a micron-scale channel. At rest, the WS is\n`dressed' by a cloud of quantised capillary waves (ripplons). Under a driving\nforce, we find that repeated WS-ripplon decoupling leads to stick-slip current\noscillations, the frequency of which can be tuned by adjusting the temperature,\npressing electric field, or electron density. The WS on liquid He is a\npromising system for the study of polaron-like decoupling dynamics.\n", "  Context:The HAGAR Telescope Array at Hanle, Ladakh has been regularly\nmonitoring the nearby blazar Mkn 421 for the past 7yrs.\n  Aims: Blazars show flux variability in all timescales across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum. While there is abundant literature characterizing the\nshort term flares from different blazars, comparatively little work has been\ndone to study the long term variability. We aim to study the long term temporal\nand spectral variability in the radiation from Mkn 421 during 2009-2015.\n  Methods: We quantify the variability and lognormality from the radio to the\nVHE bands, and compute the correlations between the various wavebands using the\nz-transformed discrete correlation function. We construct the Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED) contemporaneous with HAGAR observation seasons and fit it\nwith a one zone synchrotron self Compton model to study the spectral\nvariability.\n  Results: The flux is found to be highly variable across all time scales. The\nvariability is energy dependant, and is maximum in the X-ray and Very High\nEnergy (VHE) bands. A strong correlation is found between the Fermi-LAT (gamma)\nand radio bands, and between Fermi-LAT and optical, but none between Fermi-LAT\nand X-ray. Lognormality in the flux distribution is clearly detected. This is\nthe third blazar, following BL~Lac and PKS~2155$+$304 to show this behavior.\nThe SED can be well fit by a one zone SSC model, and variations in the flux\nstates can be attributed mainly due to changes in the particle distribution. A\nstrong correlation is seen between the break energy $\\gamma_b$ of the particle\nspectrum and the total bolometric luminosity.\n", "  We study models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with messengers that\ndo not belong to complete representations of grand-unified gauge groups. We\nshow that certain setups characterized by heavy Wino can greatly improve the\nfine tuning with respect to models with unified messengers, such as minimal\ngauge mediation. The typical models with low tuning feature multi-TeV\nsuperparticles, with the exception of the Higgsinos and possibly Bino and\nright-handed sleptons. As a consequence, the absence of signals for\nsupersymmetry at the LHC is trivially accommodated in our framework. On the\nother hand, testing these models will be challenging at the LHC. We finally\nshow that the gravitino can be a consistent candidate for cold dark matter,\nprovided a rather low reheating temperature, if a standard thermal history of\nthe universe is assumed.\n", "  We derive the von K\\'arm\\'an-Howarth equation for a full three dimensional\nincompressible two-fluid plasma. In the long-time limit and for very large\nReynolds numbers we obtain the equivalent of the hydrodynamic \"four-fifth\" law.\nThis exact law predicts the scaling of the third-order two-point correlation\nfunctions, and puts a strong constraint on the plasma turbulent dynamics.\nFinally, we derive a simple expression for the 4/5 law in terms of third-order\nstructure functions, which is appropriate for comparison with in-situ\nmeasurements in the solar wind at different spatial ranges.\n", "  We consider an integration of renewable energy into transport and electricity\nsectors through vehicle to grid (V2G) technologies for an energy system that is\npredominantly based on lignite. The national energy system of Macedonia is\nmodeled using EnergyPLAN which integrates energy for electricity, transport and\nheat, and includes hourly fluctuations in human needs and the environment. We\nshow that electric-vehicles can provide the necessary storage enabling a fully\nrenewable energy profile for Macedonia that can match the country's growing\ndemand for energy. Furthermore, a large penetration of electric vehicles leads\nto a dramatic reduction of 47% of small particles and other air pollutants\ngenerated by car traffic in 2050.\n", "  We present an overview of the current status of neutrino oscillation studies\nat atmospheric neutrino experiments. While the current data gives some\ntentalising hints regarding the neutrino mass hierarchy, octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{CP}$, the hints are not statistically significant.\nWe summarise the sensitivity to these sub-dominant three-generation effects\nfrom the next-generation proposed atmospheric neutrino experiments. We next\npresent the prospects of new physics searches such as non-standard\ninteractions, sterile neutrinos and CPT violation studies at these experiments.\n", "  In various astrophysics settings it is common to have a two-fluid\nrelativistic plasma that interacts with the electromagnetic field. While it is\ncommon to ignore the displacement current in the ideal, classical\nmagnetohydrodynamic limit, when the flows become relativistic this\napproximation is less than absolutely well-justified. In such a situation, it\nis more natural to consider a positively charged fluid made up of positrons or\nprotons interacting with a negatively charged fluid made up of electrons. The\ntwo fluids interact collectively with the full set of Maxwell's equations. As a\nresult, a solution strategy for that coupled system of equations is sought and\nfound here. Our strategy extends to higher orders, providing increasing\naccuracy. Three important innovations are reported here. In our first\ninnovation, the magnetic field within each zone is reconstructed in a\ndivergence-free fashion while the electric field within each zone is\nreconstructed in a form that is consistent with Gauss' law. In our second\ninnovation, a multidimensionally upwinded strategy is presented which ensures\nthat the magnetic field can be updated via a discrete interpretation of\nFaraday's law and the electric field can be updated via a discrete\ninterpretation of the generalized Ampere's law. Our third innovation consists\nof an efficient design for several popular IMEX schemes so that they provide\nstrong coupling between the finite-volume-based fluid solver and the\nelectromagnetic fields at high order. Several accuracy analyses are presented\nshowing that our method meets its design accuracy in the MHD limit as well as\nin the limit of electromagnetic wave propagation. Several stringent test\nproblems are also presented. We also present a relativistic version of the GEM\nproblem, which shows that our algorithm can successfully adapt to challenging\nproblems in high energy astrophysics.\n", "  We study gravity coupled to a cosmological constant and a scale but not\nconformally invariant sector. In Minkowski vacuum, scale invariance is\nspontaneously broken. We consider small fluctuations around the Minkowski\nvacuum. At the linearised level we find that the trace of metric perturbations\nreceives a positive or negative mass squared contribution. However, only for\nthe Fierz-Pauli combination the theory is free of ghosts. The mass term for the\ntrace of metric perturbations can be cancelled by explicitly breaking scale\ninvariance. This reintroduces fine-tuning. Models based on four form field\nstrength show similarities with explicit scale symmetry breaking due to\nquantisation conditions.\n", "  Understanding the resource consumption in distributed scenarios is one of the\nmain goals of quantum information theory. A prominent example for such a\nscenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge\ntheir parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While\nquantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply\nthat no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.\nWe also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and\nshow that the bound is tight for all pure states. Our results also lead to an\nincoherent version of Schumacher compression: in this case the compression rate\nis equal to the von Neumann entropy of the diagonal elements of the\ncorresponding quantum state.\n", "  Different saturation properties of cold symmetric nuclear matter in the\nstrong magnetic field have been considered. We have seen that for magnetic\nfields about $B> 3 \\times 10 ^ {17}\\ G$, {for both cases with and without\nnucleon anomalous magnetic moments}, the saturation density and saturation\nenergy grow by increasing the magnetic field. It is indicated that the magnetic\nsusceptibility of symmetric nuclear matter becomes negative showing the\ndiamagnetic response especially at $B< 3 \\times 10 ^ {17}\\ G$. We have found\nthat for the nuclear matter, the magnitude of orbital magnetization reaches the\nhigher values comparing to the spin magnetization. Our results for the\nincompressibility show that at high enough magnetic fields, i.e. $B> 3 \\times\n10 ^ {17}\\ G$, {the softening of equation of state caused by Landau\nquantization is overwhelmed by stiffening due to the magnetization of nuclear\nmatter.} We have shown that the effects of strong magnetic field on nuclear\nmatter may affect the constraints on the equation of state of symmetric nuclear\nmatter obtained applying the experimental observable.\n", "  Interactions between elementary excitations in quasi-one dimensional\nantiferromagnets are of experimental relevance and their quantitative\ntheoretical treatment has been a theoretical challenge for many years. Using\nmatrix product states, one can explicitly determine the wavefunctions of the\none- and two-particle excitations, and, consequently, the contributions to\ndynamical correlations. We apply this framework to the (non integrable)\nfrustrated dimerized spin-1/2 chain, a model for generic spin-Peierls systems,\nwhere low-energy quasi-particle excitations are bound states of topological\nsolitons. The spin structure factor involving two quasi-particle scattering\nstates is obtained in the thermodynamic limit with full momentum and frequency\nresolution. This allows very subtle features in the two-particle spectral\nfunction to be revealed which, we argue, could be seen, e.g., in inelastic\nneutron scattering of spin-Peierls compounds under a change of the external\npressure.\n", "  Varying the quantum-well width in an HgTe/CdTe heterostructure allows to\nrealize normal and inverted semiconducting band structures, making it a\nprototypical system to study two-dimensional (2D) topological-insulator\nbehavior. We have calculated the zero-temperature thermodynamic density of\nstates $D_\\mathrm{T}$ for the electron-doped situation in both regimes,\ntreating interactions within the Hartree-Fock approximation. A distinctively\ndifferent behavior for the density dependence of $D_\\mathrm{T}$ is revealed in\nthe inverted and normal cases, making it possible to detect the system's\ntopological order through measurement of macroscopic observables such as the\nquantum capacitance or electronic compressibility. Our results establish the 2D\nelectron system in HgTe quantum wells as unique in terms of its collective\nelectronic properties.\n", "  Reminiscences of my intellectual and personal interactions with Professor\nNambu, and discussion of his contributions to string theory. Switching to my\nown research, by expressing the string coordinates as bispinors, I suggest a\nkinematical framework for the interacting (2,0) theory on the light-cone by\nusing chiral constrained \"Viking\" superfields.\n", "  We compute the contribution from the longitudinally polarized proton to the\ntwist-3 double-spin asymmetry $A_{LT}$ in inclusive (light) hadron production\nfrom proton-proton collisions,i.e., $p^\\uparrow \\vec{p}\\to h\\,X$. We show that\nusing the relevant QCD equation-of-motion relation and Lorentz invariance\nrelation allows one to eliminate the twist-3 quark-gluon correlator (associated\nwith the longitudinally polarized proton) in favor of one-variable twist-3\nquark distributions and the (twist-2) transversity parton density. Including\nthis result with the twist-3 pieces associated with the transversely polarized\nproton and unpolarized final-state hadron (which have already been calculated\nin the literature), we now have the complete leading-order cross section for\nthis process.\n", "  We use the AllWISE Data Release to continue our search for WISE-detected\nmotions. In this paper, we publish another 27,846 motion objects, bringing the\ntotal number to 48,000 when objects found during our original AllWISE motion\nsurvey are included. We use this list, along with the lists of confirmed\nWISE-based motion objects from the recent papers by Luhman and by Schneider et\nal. and candidate motion objects from the recent paper by Gagne et al. to\nsearch for widely separated, common-proper-motion systems. We identify 1,039\nsuch candidate systems. All 48,000 objects are further analyzed using\ncolor-color and color-mag plots to provide possible characterizations prior to\nspectroscopic follow-up. We present spectra of 172 of these, supplemented with\nnew spectra of 23 comparison objects from the literature, and provide\nclassifications and physical interpretations of interesting sources. Highlights\ninclude: (1) the identification of three G/K dwarfs that can be used as\nstandard candles to study clumpiness and grain size in nearby molecular clouds\nbecause these objects are currently moving behind the clouds, (2) the\nconfirmation/discovery of several M, L, and T dwarfs and one white dwarf whose\nspectrophotometric distance estimates place them 5-20 pc from the Sun, (3) the\nsuggestion that the Na 'D' line be used as a diagnostic tool for interpreting\nand classifying metal-poor late-M and L dwarfs, (4) the recognition of a triple\nsystem including a carbon dwarf and late-M subdwarf, for which model fits of\nthe late-M subdwarf (giving [Fe/H] ~ -1.0) provide a measured metallicity for\nthe carbon star, and (5) a possible 24-pc-distant K5 dwarf + peculiar red L5\nsystem with an apparent physical separation of 0.1 pc.\n", "  We analyse the causal structure of the ambient boundary, the conformal\ninfinity of the ambient (Poincar\\'e) metric. Using topological tools we show\nthat the only causal relation compatible with the global topology of the\nboundary spacetime is the horismos order. This has important consequences for\nthe notion of time in the conformal geometry of the ambient boundary.\n", "  We construct exact solutions to an unusual nonlinear advection--diffusion\nequation arising in the study of Taylor--Aris (also known as shear) dispersion\ndue to electroosmotic flow during electromigration in a capillary. An exact\nreduction to a Darboux equation is found under a traveling-wave anzats. The\nequilibria of this ordinary differential equation are analyzed, showing that\ntheir stability is determined solely by the (dimensionless) wave speed without\nregard to any (dimensionless) physical parameters. Integral curves, connecting\nthe appropriate equilibria of the Darboux equation that governs traveling\nwaves, are constructed, which in turn are shown to be asymmetric kink solutions\n({\\it i.e.}, non-Taylor shocks). Furthermore, it is shown that the governing\nDarboux equation exhibits bistability, which leads to two coexisting\nnon-negative kink solutions for (dimensionless) wave speeds greater than unity.\nFinally, we give some remarks on other types of traveling-wave solutions and a\ndiscussion of some approximations of the governing partial differential\nequation of electromigration dispersion.\n", "  Some of the featured results of the Dubna-Mainz-Taipei (DMT) dynamical model\nfor $\\pi N$ scattering and $\\pi^0$ electromagnetic production are summarized.\nThese include results for threshold $\\pi^0$ production, deformation of\n$\\Delta(1232)$, and the extracted properties of higher resonances below 2 GeV.\nThe excellent agreement of DMT model's predictions with threshold $\\pi^0$\nproduction data, including the recent precision measurements from MAMI\nestablishes results of DMT model as a benchmark for experimentalists and\ntheorists in dealing with threshold pion production.\n", "  The $Chandra$ archival data is a valuable resource for various studies on\ndifferent topics of X-ray astronomy. In this paper, we utilize this wealth and\npresent a uniformly processed data set, which can be used to address a wide\nrange of scientific questions. The data analysis procedures are applied to\n10,029 ACIS observations, which produces 363,530 source detections, belonging\nto 217,828 distinct X-ray sources. This number is twice the size of the\n$Chandra$ Source Catalog (Version 1.1). The catalogs in this paper provide\nabundant estimates of the detected X-ray source properties, including source\npositions, counts, colors, fluxes, luminosities, variability statistics, etc.\nCross-correlation of these objects with galaxies shows 17,828 sources are\nlocated within the $D_{25}$ isophotes of 1110 galaxies, and 7504 sources are\nlocated between the $D_{25}$ and 2$D_{25}$ isophotes of 910 galaxies.\nContamination analysis with the log$N$--log$S$ relation indicates that 51.3\\%\nof objects within 2$D_{25}$ isophotes are truly relevant to galaxies, and the\n\"net\" source fraction increases to 58.9\\%, 67.3\\%, and 69.1\\% for sources with\nluminosities above $10^{37}$, $10^{38}$, and $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Among the\npossible scientific uses of this catalog, we discuss the possibility to study\nintra-observation variability, inter-observation variability, and supersoft\nsources.\n", "  Few-layered black phosphorus materials recently attract much attention due to\nits special electronic properties. As a Consequence, the nano-tube from a\nsingle-layer black phosphorus has been theoretically built. The corresponding\nelectronic properties of such black phosphorus nano-tube were also evaluated\nnumerically.\n", "  We report on the noise properties of ion-irradiated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$\nJosephson junctions. This work aims at investigating the linewidth of the\nJosephson oscillation with a detector response experiment at $\\simeq$132 GHz.\nExperimental results are compared with a simple analytical model based on the\nLikharev-Semenov equation and the de Gennes dirty limit approximation. We show\nthat the main source of low-frequency fluctuations in these junctions is the\nbroadband Johnson noise and that the excess ($\\frac{1}{f}$) noise contribution\ndoes not prevail in the temperature range of interest, as reported in some\nother types of high-T$_c$ superconducting Josephson junctions. Finally, we\ndiscuss the interest of ion-irradiated junctions to implement frequency-tunable\noscillators consisting of synchronized arrays of Josephson junctions.\n", "  Very high quality light curves are now available for thousands of detached\neclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems as a result of surveys\nfor transiting exoplanets and other large-scale photometric surveys. I have\ndeveloped a binary star model (ELLC) that can be used to analyse the light\ncurves of detached eclipsing binary stars and transiting exoplanet systems that\nis fast and accurate, and that can include the effects of star spots, Doppler\nboosting and light-travel time within binaries with eccentric orbits. The model\nrepresents the stars as triaxial ellipsoids. The apparent flux from the binary\nis calculated using Gauss-Legendre integration over the ellipses that are the\nprojection of these ellipsoids on the sky. The model can also be used to\ncalculate the flux-weighted radial velocity of the stars during an eclipse\n(Rossiter-McLaughlin effect). The main features of the model have been tested\nby comparison to observed data and other light curve models. The model is found\nto be accurate enough to analyse the very high quality photometry that is now\navailable from space-spaced instruments, flexible enough to model a wide range\nof eclipsing binary stars and extrasolar planetary systems, and fast enough to\nenable the use of modern Monte Carlo methods for data analysis and model\ntesting.\n", "  (Abridged) Many of the observed CO line profiles exhibit broad linewidths\nthat greatly exceed the thermal broadening expected within molecular clouds.\nThese suprathermal CO linewidths are assumed to be originated from the presence\nof unresolved supersonic motions inside clouds. Typically overlooked in the\nliterature, in this paper we aim to quantify the impact of the opacity\nbroadening effects on the current interpretation of the CO suprathermal line\nprofiles. Without any additional contributions to the gas velocity field, a\nlarge fraction of the apparently supersonic (${\\cal M}\\sim$2-3) linewidths\nmeasured in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO (J=1-0) lines can be explained by the\nsaturation of their corresponding sonic-like, optically-thin C$^{18}$O\ncounterparts assuming standard isotopic fractionation. Combined with the\npresence of multiple components detected in our C$^{18}$O spectra, these\nopacity effects seem to be also responsible of the highly supersonic linewidths\n(${\\cal M}>$8-10) detected in the broadest $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO spectra in\nTaurus. Our results demonstrate that most of the suprathermal $^{12}$CO and\n$^{13}$CO linewidths could be primarily created by a combination of opacity\nbroadening effects and multiple gas velocity components blended in these\nsaturated emission lines. Once corrected by their corresponding optical depth,\neach of these gas components present transonic intrinsic linewidths\nconsistently traced by the three CO isotopologues within a factor of 2. Highly\ncorrelated and velocity-coherent at large scales, the largest and highly\nsupersonic velocity differences inside clouds are generated by the relative\nmotions between individual gas components. This highly discretized structure of\nthe molecular gas traced in CO suggest that the gas dynamics inside molecular\nclouds could be better described by the properties of a fully-resolved\nmacroscopic turbulence.\n", "  Numerical simulation of numerous mm/cm-sized particles embedded in a gaseous\ndisk has become an important tool in the study of planet formation and in\nunderstanding the dust distribution in observed protoplanetary disks. However,\nthe mutual drag force between the gas and the particles can become so stiff,\nparticularly because of small particles and/or strong local solid\nconcentration, that an explicit integration of this system is computationally\nformidable. In this work, we consider the integration of the mutual drag force\nin a system of Eulerian gas and Lagrangian solid particles. Despite the\nentanglement between the gas and the particles under the particle-mesh\nconstruct, we are able to devise a numerical algorithm that effectively\ndecomposes the globally coupled system of equations for the mutual drag force\nand makes it possible to integrate this system on a cell-by-cell basis, which\nconsiderably reduces the computational task required. We use an analytical\nsolution for the temporal evolution of each cell to relieve the time-step\nconstraint posed by the mutual drag force as well as to achieve the highest\ndegree of accuracy. To validate our algorithm, we use an extensive suite of\nbenchmarks with known solutions in one, two, and three dimensions, including\nthe linear growth and the nonlinear saturation of the streaming instability. We\ndemonstrate numerical convergence and satisfactory consistency in all cases.\nOur algorithm can for example be applied to model the evolution of the\nstreaming instability with mm/cm-sized pebbles at high mass loading, which has\nimportant consequences for the formation scenarios of planetesimals.\n", "  The transport of the energy contained in electrons, both thermal and\nsuprathermal, in solar flares plays a key role in our understanding of many\naspects of the flare phenomenon, from the spatial distribution of hard X-ray\nemission to global energetics. Motivated by recent {\\em RHESSI} observations\nthat point to the existence of a mechanism that confines electrons to the\ncoronal parts of flare loops more effectively than Coulomb collisions, we here\nconsider the impact of pitch-angle scattering off turbulent magnetic\nfluctuations on the parallel transport of electrons in flaring coronal loops.\nIt is shown that the presence of such a scattering mechanism in addition to\nCoulomb collisional scattering can significantly reduce the parallel thermal\nand electrical conductivities relative to their collisional values. We provide\nillustrative expressions for the resulting thermoelectric coefficients that\nrelate the thermal flux and electrical current density to the temperature\ngradient and the applied electric field. We then evaluate the effect of these\nmodified transport coefficients on the flare coronal temperature that can be\nattained, on the post-impulsive-phase cooling of heated coronal plasma, and on\nthe importance of the beam-neutralizing return current on both ambient heating\nand the energy loss rate of accelerated electrons. We also discuss the possible\nways in which anomalous transport processes have an impact on the required\noverall energy associated with accelerated electrons in solar flares.\n", "  The decay of neutrino mass eigenstates leads to a change of the conversion\nand survival probability of neutrino flavor eigenstates. Remarkably, we find\nthat the neutrino decay provides an enhancement of the expected tau appearance\nsignal with respect to the standard oscillation scenario for the long-baseline\nOPERA experiment. The increase of the $\\nu_\\mu \\rightarrow \\nu_\\tau$ conversion\nprobability by the decay of one of the mass eigenstates is due to a reduction\nof the \"destructive interference\" among the different massive neutrino\ncomponents. Motivated by the recently released results of the OPERA\nCollaboration showing a number of observed $\\nu_\\tau$ events larger than\nexpected, we perform a statistical analysis including the invisible decay\nhypothesis. We obtain a very mild preference for invisible decays, with a best\nfit value $\\tau_3/m_3 \\simeq 2.6\\times 10^{-13} $ s/eV, and a constraint at the\n90$\\%$ confidence level for the neutrino decay lifetime to be $\\tau_3/m_3\n\\gtrsim 1.3\\times 10^{-13}$ s/eV.\n", "  The giant electro-optical response of Rydberg atoms manifests itself in the\nemergence of sidebands in the Rydberg excitation spectrum if the atom is\nexposed to a radio-frequency (RF) electric field. Here we report on the study\nof RF-dressed Rydberg atoms inside hollow-core photonic crystal fibres\n(HC-PCF), a system that enables the use of low modulation voltages and offers\nthe prospect of miniaturised vapour-based electro-optical devices. Narrow\nspectroscopic features caused by the RF field are observed for modulation\nfrequencies up to 500 MHz.\n", "  We present a coarse-graining strategy that we test for aqueous mixtures. The\nmethod uses pair-wise cumulative coordination as a target function within an\niterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) like protocol. We name this method\ncoordination iterative Boltzmann inversion ($\\mathcal {C}-$IBI). While the\nunderlying coarse-grained model is still structure based and, thus, preserves\npair-wise solution structure, our method also reproduces solvation\nthermodynamics of binary and/or ternary mixtures. Additionally, we observe much\nfaster convergence within $\\mathcal {C}-$IBI compared to IBI. To validate the\nrobustness, we apply $\\mathcal {C}-$IBI to study test cases of solvation\nthermodynamics of aqueous urea and a triglycine solvation in aqueous urea.\n", "  We analyze a variant of a model proposed by Kuramoto, Shinomoto, and\nSakaguchi for a large population of coupled oscillatory and excitable elements.\nUsing the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we reduce the behavior of the population to a\ntwo-dimensional dynamical system with three parameters. We present the\nstability diagram and calculate several of its bifurcation curves analytically,\nfor both excitatory and inhibitory coupling. Our main result is that when the\ncoupling function is broad, the system can display bistability between steady\nstates of constant high and low activity, whereas when the coupling function is\nnarrow and inhibitory, one of the states in the bistable regime can show\npersistent pulsations in activity.\n", "  Despite decades of study, we still do not fully understand why some massive\ngalaxies abruptly switch off their star formation in the early Universe, and\nwhat causes their rapid transition to the red sequence. Post-starburst galaxies\nprovide a rare opportunity to study this transition phase, but few have\ncurrently been spectroscopically identified at high redshift ($z>1$). In this\npaper we present the spectroscopic verification of a new photometric technique\nto identify post-starbursts in high-redshift surveys. The method classifies the\nbroad-band optical-near--infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of\ngalaxies using three spectral shape parameters (super-colours), derived from a\nprincipal component analysis of model SEDs. When applied to the multiwavelength\nphotometric data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), this technique\nidentified over 900 candidate post-starbursts at redshifts $0.5<z<2.0$. In this\nstudy we present deep optical spectroscopy for a subset of these galaxies, in\norder to confirm their post-starburst nature. Where a spectroscopic assessment\nwas possible, we find the majority (19/24 galaxies; ~80 per cent) exhibit the\nstrong Balmer absorption (H $\\delta$ equivalent width $W_{\\lambda}$ >5 Ang.)\nand Balmer break, characteristic of post-starburst galaxies. We conclude that\nphotometric methods can be used to select large samples of recently-quenched\ngalaxies in the distant Universe.\n", "  A sequence search method was developed for searching for regular frequency\nspacing in delta Scuti stars by visual inspection and algorithmic search. The\nsample contains 90 delta Scuti stars observed by CoRoT. An example is given to\nrepresent the visual inspection. The algorithm (SSA) is described in detail.\nThe data treatment of the CoRoT light curves, the criteria for frequency\nfiltering and the spacings derived by two methods (three approaches: VI, SSA\nand FT) are given for each target. Echelle diagrams are presented for 77\ntargets, for which at least one sequence of regular spacing was identified.\nComparing the spacing and the shifts between pairs of echelle ridges revealed\nthat at least one pair of echelle ridges is shifted to midway between the\nspacing for 22 stars. The estimated rotational frequencies compared to the\nshifts revealed rotationally split doublets, triplets and multiplets not only\nfor single frequencies, but for the complete echelle ridges in 31 delta Scuti\nstars. Using several possible assumptions for the origin of the spacings, we\nderived the large separation ($\\Delta\\nu$), which are distributed along the\nmean density versus large separations relation derived from stellar models\nSuarez 2014.\n", "  Effects of the inhomogeneous matter density on the three-generation neutrino\noscillation probability are analyzed. Realistic profile of the matter density\nis expanded into a Fourier series. Taking in the Fourier modes one by one, we\ndemonstrate that each mode has its corresponding target energy. The high\nFourier mode selectively modifies the oscillation probability of the low-energy\nregion. This rule is well described by the parametric resonance between the\nneutrino oscillation and the matter effect. The Fourier analysis gives a simple\nguideline to systematically control the uncertainty of the oscillation\nprobability caused by the uncertain density of matter. Precise analysis of the\noscillation probability down to the low-energy region requires accurate\nevaluation of the Fourier coefficients of the matter density up to the\ncorresponding high modes.\n", "  We consider Detweiler's redshift variable $z$ for a nonspinning mass $m_1$ in\ncircular motion (with orbital frequency $\\Omega$) around a nonspinning mass\n$m_2$. We show how the combination of effective-one-body (EOB) theory with the\nfirst law of binary dynamics allows one to derive a simple, exact expression\nfor the functional dependence of $z$ on the (gauge-invariant) EOB gravitational\npotential $u=(m_1+m_2)/R$. We then use the recently obtained\nhigh-post-Newtonian(PN)-order knowledge of the main EOB radial potential $A(u ;\n\\nu)$ [where $\\nu= m_1 m_2/(m_1+m_2)^2$] to decompose the\nsecond-self-force-order contribution to the function $z(m_2 \\Omega, m_1/m_2)$\ninto a known part (which goes beyond the 4PN level in including the 5PN\nlogarithmic term, and the 5.5PN contribution), and an unknown one [depending on\nthe yet unknown, 5PN, 6PN, $\\ldots$, contributions to the $O(\\nu^2)$\ncontribution to the EOB radial potential $A(u ; \\nu)$]. We indicate the\nexpected singular behaviors, near the lightring, of the second-self-force-order\ncontributions to both the redshift and the EOB $A$ potential. Our results\nshould help both in extracting information of direct dynamical significance\nfrom ongoing second-self-force-order computations, and in parametrizing their\nglobal strong-field behaviors. We also advocate computing\nsecond-self-force-order conservative quantities by iterating the time-symmetric\nGreen-function in the background spacetime.\n", "  The association of filaments with protostellar objects has made these\nstructures a priority target in star formation studies. The datasets of the\nHerschel Galactic Cold Cores Key Programme allow for a statistical study of\nfilaments with a wide range of intrinsic and environmental characteristics.\nCharacterisation of this sample can be used to identify key physical parameters\nand quantify the role of environment in the formation of supercritical\nfilaments. Filaments were extracted from fields at D<500pc with the\ngetfilaments algorithm and characterised according to their column density\nprofiles and intrinsic properties. Each profile was fitted with a\nbeam-convolved Plummer-like function and quantified based on the relative\ncontributions from the filament 'core', represented by a Gaussian, and 'wing'\ncomponent, dominated by the power-law of the Plummer-like function. These\nparameters were examined for populations associated with different background\nlevels. We find that filaments increase their core (Mcore) and wing (Mwing)\ncontributions while increasing their total linear mass density (Mtot). Both\ncomponents appear to be linked to the local environment, with filaments in\nhigher backgrounds having systematically more massive Mcore and Mwing. This\ndependence on the environment supports an accretion-based model for filament\nevolution in the local neighbourhood (D<500pc). Structures located in the\nhighest backgrounds develop the highest central Av, Mcore, and Mwing as Mtot\nincreases with time, favoured by the local availability of material and the\nenhanced gravitational potential. Our results indicate that filaments acquiring\na significantly massive central region with Mcore>Mcrit/2 may become\nsupercritical and form stars. This translates into a need for filaments to\nbecome at least moderately self-gravitating in order to undergo localised star\nformation or become star-forming filaments.\n", "  To investigate the potential connection between the intense X-ray emission\nfrom young, low-mass stars and the lifetimes of their circumstellar,\nplanet-forming disks, we have compiled the X-ray luminosities ($L_X$) of M\nstars in the $\\sim$8 Myr-old TW Hya Association (TWA) for which X-ray data are\npresently available. Our investigation includes analysis of archival Chandra\ndata for the TWA binary systems TWA 8, 9, and 13. Although our study suffers\nfrom poor statistics for stars later than M3, we find a trend of decreasing\n$L_X/L_{bol}$ with decreasing $T_{eff}$ for TWA M stars wherein the\nearliest-type (M0--M2) stars cluster near $\\log{(L_X/L_{bol})} \\approx -3.0$\nand then $\\log{(L_X/L_{bol})}$ decreases, and its distribution broadens, for\ntypes M4 and later. The fraction of TWA stars that display evidence for\nresidual primordial disk material also sharply increases in this same (mid-M)\nspectral type regime. This apparent anticorrelation between the relative X-ray\nluminosities of low-mass TWA stars and the longevities of their circumstellar\ndisks suggests that primordial disks orbiting early-type M stars in the TWA\nhave dispersed rapidly as a consequence of their persistent large X-ray fluxes.\nConversely, the disks orbiting the very lowest-mass pre-MS stars and pre-MS\nbrown dwarfs in the Association may have survived because their X-ray\nluminosities and, hence, disk photoevaporation rates are very low to begin\nwith, and then further decline relatively early in their pre-MS evolution.\n", "  It is often argued that low fine tuning in the MSSM necessarily requires a\nrather light Higgsino. In this note we show that this need not be the case when\na more complete set of soft SUSY breaking mass terms are included. In\nparticular an Higgsino mass term, that correlates the $\\mu-$term contribution\nwith the soft SUSY-breaking Higgsino masses, significantly reduces the fine\ntuning even for Higgsinos in the TeV mass range where its relic abundance means\nit can make up all the dark matter.\n", "  It is shown that in the Schwarzschild background there exists direct\ncounterpart of the Ba\\~{n}ados-Silk-West effect for spinning particles. This\nmeans that if two particles collide near the black hole horizon, their energy\nin the centre of mass frame can grow unbounded. In doing so, the crucial role\nis played by so-called near-critical trajectories when particle's parameters\nare almost fine-tuned. Direct scenario of the collision under discussion is\npossible with restriction on the energy-to-mass ratio \\thinspace\n$E/m<\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}$ only. However, if one takes into account multiple\nscattering, this becomes possible for $E\\geq m$ as well.\n", "  We demonstrate an optical conveyor belt for levitated nano-particles over\nseveral centimeters inside both air-filled and evacuated hollow-core photonic\ncrystal fibers (HCPCF). Detection of the transmitted light field allows\nthree-dimensional read-out of the particle center-of-mass motion. An additional\nlaser enables axial radiation pressure based feedback cooling over the full\nfiber length. We show that the particle dynamics is a sensitive local probe for\ncharacterizing the optical intensity profile inside the fiber as well as the\npressure distribution along the fiber axis. In contrast to previous indirect\nmeasurement methods we find a linear pressure dependence inside the HCPCF\nextending over three orders of magnitude from 0.2 mbar to 100 mbar. A targeted\napplication is the controlled delivery of nano-particles from ambient pressure\ninto medium vacuum.\n", "  We investigate the asymptotic structure of the three dimensional warped anti\nde sitter black holes in the Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend massive gravity\nusing the canonical Hamiltonian formalism. We define the canonical asymptotic\nguage generators, which produce the conserved charges and the asymptotic\nsymmetry group for the warped anti de sitter black holes. The attained symmetry\ngroup is described by a semi direct sum of a Virasoro and a KacMoody algebra.\nUsing the Sugawara construction, we obtain a direct sum of two Virasoro\nalgebras. We show that not only the asymptotic conserved charges satisfy the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics, but also they lead to the expected\nSmarr formula for the warped anti de sitter black holes. We also show that the\nblack hole entropy obeys the Cardy formula of the dual conformal field theory .\n", "  With half the drift-tube diameter of the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers\nof the ATLAS muon spectrometer and otherwise unchanged operating parameters,\nsmall-diameter Muon Drift Tube (sMDT) chambers provide an order of magnitude\nhigher rate capability and can be installed in detector regions where MDT\nchambers do not fit. The chamber assembly time has been reduced by a factor of\nseven to one working day and the sense wire positioning accuracy improved by a\nfactor of two to better than ten microns. Two sMDT chambers have been installed\nin ATLAS in 2014 to improve the momentum resolution in the barrel part of the\nspectrometer. The construction of an additional twelve chambers covering the\nfeet regions of the ATLAS detector has started. It will be followed by the\nreplacement of the MDT chambers at the ends of the barrel inner layer by sMDTs\nimproving the Performance at the high expected background rates and providing\nspace for additional RPC trigger chambers.\n", "  We apply the complex Langevin (CL) method to a chiral random matrix theory\n(ChRMT) at non-zero chemical potential and study the nearest neighbor spacing\n(NNS) distribution of the Dirac eigenvalues. The NNS distribution is extracted\nusing an unfolding procedure for the Dirac eigenvalues obtained in the CL\nmethod. For large quark mass, we find that the NNS distribution obeys the\nGinibre ensemble as expected. For small quark mass, the NNS distribution\nfollows the Wigner surmise for correct convergence case, while it follows the\nGinibre ensemble for wrong convergence case. The Wigner surmise is physically\nreasonable from the chemical potential independence of the ChRMT. The Ginibre\nensemble is known to be favored in a phase quenched QCD at finite chemical\npotential. Our result suggests a possibility that the originally universal\nbehavior of the NNS distribution is preserved even in the CL method for correct\nconvergence case.\n", "  Recently there have been increasingly hot debates on whether a bulk Fermi\nsurface of charge-neutral excitations exists in the topological Kondo insulator\nSmB6. To unambiguously resolve this issue, we performed the low-temperature\nthermal conductivity measurements of a high-quality SmB6 single crystal down to\n0.1 K and up to 14.5 T. Our experiments show that the residual linear term of\nthermal conductivity at zero field is zero, within the experimental accuracy.\nFurthermore, the thermal conductivity is insensitive to magnetic field up to\n14.5 T. These results exclude the existence of fermionic charge-neutral\nexcitations in bulk SmB6, such as scalar Majorana fermions or spinons, thus put\na strong constraint on the explanation of the quantum oscillations observed in\nSmB6.\n", "  We present the methodology and data behind the photometric redshift database\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12). We adopt a hybrid\ntechnique, empirically estimating the redshift via local regression on a\nspectroscopic training set, then fitting a spectrum template to obtain\nK-corrections and absolute magnitudes. The SDSS spectroscopic catalog was\naugmented with data from other, publicly available spectroscopic surveys to\nmitigate target selection effects. The training set is comprised of $1,976,978$\ngalaxies, and extends up to redshift $z\\approx 0.8$, with a useful coverage of\nup to $z\\approx 0.6$. We provide photometric redshifts and realistic error\nestimates for the $208,474,076$ galaxies of the SDSS primary photometric\ncatalog. We achieve an average bias of $\\overline{\\Delta z_{\\mathrm{norm}}} =\n5.84 \\times 10^{-5}$, a standard deviation of $\\sigma \\left(\\Delta\nz_{\\mathrm{norm}}\\right)=0.0205$, and a $3\\sigma$ outlier rate of $P_o=4.11\\%$\nwhen cross-validating on our training set. The published redshift error\nestimates and photometric error classes enable the selection of galaxies with\nhigh quality photometric redshifts. We also provide a supplementary error map\nthat allows additional, sophisticated filtering of the data.\n", "  The electronic spin of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond forms an\natomically sized, highly sensitive sensor for magnetic fields. To harness the\nfull potential of individual NV centers for sensing with high sensitivity and\nnanoscale spatial resolution, NV centers have to be incorporated into scanning\nprobe structures enabling controlled scanning in close proximity to the sample\nsurface. Here, we present an optimized procedure to fabricate single-crystal,\nall-diamond scanning probes starting from commercially available diamond and\nshow a highly efficient and robust approach for integrating these devices in a\ngeneric atomic force microscope. Our scanning probes consisting of a scanning\nnanopillar (200 nm diameter, $1-2\\,\\mu$m length) on a thin ($< 1\\mu$m)\ncantilever structure, enable efficient light extraction from diamond in\ncombination with a high magnetic field sensitivity\n($\\mathrm{\\eta_{AC}}\\approx50\\pm20\\,\\mathrm{nT}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$). As a\nfirst application of our scanning probes, we image the magnetic stray field of\na single Ni nanorod. We show that this stray field can be approximated by a\nsingle dipole and estimate the NV-to-sample distance to a few tens of\nnanometer, which sets the achievable resolution of our scanning probes.\n", "  We analyze how passive galaxies at z $\\sim$ 1.5 populate the mass-size plane\nas a function of their stellar age, to understand if the observed size growth\nwith time can be explained with the appearance of larger quenched galaxies at\nlower redshift. We use a sample of 32 passive galaxies extracted from the Wide\nField Camera 3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel (WISP) survey with spectroscopic\nredshift 1.3 $\\lesssim$ z $\\lesssim$ 2.05, specific star-formation rates lower\nthan 0.01 Gyr$^{-1}$, and stellar masses above 4.5 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$\nM$_\\odot$. All galaxies have spectrally determined stellar ages from fitting of\ntheir rest-frame optical spectra and photometry with stellar population models.\nWhen dividing our sample into young (age $\\leq$ 2.1 Gyr) and old (age $>$ 2.1\nGyr) galaxies we do not find a significant trend in the distributions of the\ndifference between the observed radius and the one predicted by the mass-size\nrelation. This result indicates that the relation between the galaxy age and\nits distance from the mass-size relation, if it exists, is rather shallow, with\na slope alpha $\\gtrsim$ -0.6. At face value, this finding suggests that\nmultiple dry and/or wet minor mergers, rather than the appearance of newly\nquenched galaxies, are mainly responsible for the observed time evolution of\nthe mass-size relation in passive galaxies.\n", "  A two-band model with repulsive interband coupling and interband {\\it\ntransport} (potential) scattering is considered to elucidate their effects on\nmaterial properties. In agreement with previous work, we find that the bands\norder parameters $\\Delta_{1,2}$ differ and the large is at the band with a\nsmaller normal density of states (DOS), $N_{n2}<N_{n1}$. However, the bands\nenergy gaps, as determined by the energy dependence of the DOS, are equal due\nto scattering. For each temperature, the gaps turn zero at a certain critical\ninterband scattering rate, i.e. for strong enough scattering the model material\nbecomes gappless. In the gapless state, the DOS at the band 2 is close to the\nnormal state value, whereas at the band 1 it has a V-shape with non-zero\nminimum. When the normal bands DOS' are mismatched, $N_{n1}\\ne N_{n2}$, the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ is suppressed even in the absence of interband\nscattering, $T_c(N_{n1})$ has a dome-like shape. With increasing interband\nscattering, the London penetration depth at low temperatures evolves from being\nexponentially flat to the power-law and even to near linear behavior in the\ngapless state, the latter being easily misinterpreted as caused by order\nparameter nodes.\n", "  It is shown that phagraphene, a recently predicted planar allotrope of\ngraphene with Dirac fermions, is unstable or, at least, almost unstable with\nrespect to transverse atomic displacements. This result is obtained by\nnumerical calculations in the framework of both the tight-binding model and the\ndensity functional theory. A nonplanar atomic configuration of phagraphene has\na wavy shape and is almost degenerate in energy with the planar configuration.\nThe main types of possible structural defects in phagraphene are determined.\nThe temperature dependence of characteristic times of their formation is found.\n", "  Dark matter searches in gamma ray final states often make use of the fact\nthat photons can be produced from final state muons. Modern Monte Carlo\ngenerators and DM codes include the effects of final state radiation from muons\nproduced in the dark matter annihilation process itself, but neglect the O(1%)\nradiative correction that arises from the subsequent muon decay. After\nimplementing this correction we demonstrate the effect that it can have on dark\nmatter phenomenology by considering the case of dark matter annihilation to\nfour muons via scalar mediator production. We first show that the AMS-02\npositron excess can no longer easily be made consistent with this final state\nonce the Fermi-LAT dwarf limits are calculated with the inclusion of radiative\nmuon decays, and we next show that the Fermi-LAT galactic centre gamma excess\ncan be improved with this final state after inclusion of the same effect. We\nprovide code and tables for the implementation of this effect in the popular\ndark matter code micrOMEGAs, providing a solution for any model producing final\nstate muons.\n", "  Black hole spin will have a large impact on searches for gravitational waves\nwith advanced detectors. While only a few stellar mass black hole spins have\nbeen measured using X-ray techniques, gravitational wave detectors have the\ncapacity to greatly increase the statistics of black hole spin measurements. We\nshow what we might learn from these measurements and how the black hole spin\nvalues are influenced by their formation channels.\n", "  On the basis of solutions of the Bragg-Hawthorne equations we discuss the\nhelicity of thin toroidal vortices with the swirl - the orbital motion along\nthe torus diretrix. It is shown that relationship of the helicity with\ncirculations along the small and large linked circles - directrix and\ngeneratrix of the torus - depends on distribution of the azimuthal velocity in\nthe core of the swirling vortex ring. In the case of non-homogeneous swirl this\nrelationship differs from the well-known Moffat relationship - the doubled\nproduct of such circulations multiplied by the number of links. The results can\nbe applied to vortices in planetary atmospheres and to vortex movements in the\nvicinity of active galactic nuclei.\n", "  We report results of a re-analysis of archival Spitzer IRAC direct imaging\nsurveys encompassing a variety of nearby stars. Our sample is generated from\nthe combined observations of 73 young stars (median age, distance, spectral\ntype = 85 Myr, 23.3 pc, G5) and 48 known exoplanet host stars with\nunconstrained ages (median distance, spectral type = 22.6 pc, G5). While the\nsmall size of Spitzer provides a lower resolution than 8m-class AO-assisted\nground based telescopes, which have been used for constraining the frequency of\n0.5 - 13 $M_J$ planets at separations of $10 - 10^2$ AU, its exquisite infrared\nsensitivity provides the ability to place unmatched constraints on the\nplanetary populations at wider separations. Here we apply sophisticated\nhigh-contrast techniques to our sample in order to remove the stellar PSF and\nopen up sensitivity to planetary mass companions down to 5\\arcsec\\ separations.\nThis enables sensitivity to 0.5 - 13 $M_J$ planets at physical separations on\nthe order of $10^2 - 10^3$ AU , allowing us to probe a parameter space which\nhas not previously been systematically explored to any similar degree of\nsensitivity. Based on a colour and proper motion analysis we do not record any\nplanetary detections. Exploiting this enhanced survey sensitivity, employing\nMonte Carlo simulations with a Bayesian approach, and assuming a mass\ndistribution of $dn/dm \\propto m^{-1.31}$, we constrain (at 95% confidence) a\npopulation of 0.5 - 13 $M_J$ planets at separations of 100 - 1000 AU with an\nupper frequency limit of 9%.\n", "  We consider non-Abelian strings in N=2 supersymmetric QCD with the U$(N)$\ngauge group and $N_f=N$ quark flavors deformed by a mass term for the adjoint\nmatter. This deformation breaks N=2 supersymmetry down to N=1. Dynamics of\norientational zero modes on the string world sheet are described then by\nCP$(N-1)$ model with N=(0,2) supersymmetry. We study the string of a finite\nlength $L$ assuming compactification on a cylinder (periodic boundary\nconditions). The world-sheet theory is solved in the large-$N$ approximation.\nWe find a rich phase structure in the $(L, \\,u)$ plane where $u$ is a\ndeformation parameter. At large $L$ and intermediate $u$ we find a phase with\nbroken $Z_{2N}$ symmetry, $N$ vacua and a mass gap. At large values of $L$ and\n$u$ still larger we have the $Z_{2N}$-symmetric phase with a single vacuum and\nmassless fermions. In both phases N=(0,2) supersymmetry is spontaneously\nbroken. We also observe a phase with broken SU$(N)\\;$ symmetry at small $L$. In\nthe latter phase the mass gap vanishes and the vacuum energy is zero in the\nleading $1/N$ approximation. However, we expect that $1/N$ corrections will\nbreak N=(0,2) supersymmetry. We also discuss how this rich phase structure\nmatches the N=(2,2) limit in which the world-sheet theory has a single phase\nwith the mass gap independent of $L$.\n", "  By making use of conformal mapping, we construct various time-evolution\noperators in (1+1) dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), which take the\nform $\\int dx\\, f(x) \\mathcal{H}(x)$, where $\\mathcal{H}(x)$ is the Hamiltonian\ndensity of the CFT, and $f(x)$ is an envelope function. Examples of such\ndeformed evolution operators include the entanglement Hamiltonian, and the\nso-called sine-square deformation of the CFT. Within our construction, the\nspectrum and the (finite-size) scaling of the level spacing of the deformed\nevolution operator are known exactly. Based on our construction, we also\npropose a regularized version of the sine-square deformation, which, in\ncontrast to the original sine-square deformation, has the spectrum of the CFT\ndefined on a spatial circle of finite circumference $L$, and for which the\nlevel spacing scales as $1/L^2$, once the circumference of the circle and the\nregularization parameter are suitably adjusted.\n", "  We report the magnetism and transport properties of the Heusler compound\nFe2+xV1-xAl at -0.10 < x < 0.10 under pressure and a magnetic field. A\nmetal-insulator quantum phase transition occurred at x = -0.05. Application of\npressure or a magnetic field facilitated the emergence of finite\nzero-temperature conductivity around the critical point, which scaled\napproximately according to the power law. At x < -0.05, a localized\nparamagnetic spin appeared, whereas above the ferromagnetic quantum critical\npoint at x = 0.05, itinerant ferromagnetism was established. At the quantum\ncritical points at x = -0.05 and 0.05, the resistivity and specific heat\nexhibited singularities characteristic of a Griffiths phase appearing as an\ninhomogeneous electronic state.\n", "  We prove that sphaleron black holes in ${\\mathfrak {su}}(2)$\nEinstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with a Higgs doublet in four-dimensional,\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter space-time are unstable.\n", "  We study the experimental $DK$ invariant mass spectra of the reactions $B^+\n\\to \\bar{D}^0 D^0 K^+$, $B^0 \\to D^- D^0 K^+$ (measured by the BaBar\nCollaboration) and $B_s \\to \\pi^+ \\bar{D}^0 K^-$ (measured by the LHCb\nCollaboration), where an enhancement right above the threshold is seen. We show\nthat this enhancement is due to the presence of $D^\\ast_{s0}(2317)$, which is a\n$DK$ bound state in the $I(J^P) = 0(0^+)$ sector. We employ a unitarized\namplitude with an interaction potential fixed by heavy meson chiral\nperturbation theory. We obtain a mass $M_{D^\\ast_{s0}} = 2315^{+12}_{-17}\\\n^{+10}_{-5}\\ \\text{MeV}$, and we also show, by means of the Weinberg\ncompositeness condition, that the $DK$ component in the wave function of this\nstate is $P_{DK} = 70^{+4}_{-6}\\ ^{+4}_{-8} \\%$, where the first (second) error\nis statistical (systematic).\n", "  We present observations from the Gaia-ESO Survey in the lines of H$\\alpha$,\n[N II], [S II] and He I of nebular emission in the central part of the Carina\nNebula.\n  We investigate the properties of the two already known kinematic components\n(approaching and receding, respectively), which account for the bulk of\nemission. Moreover, we investigate the features of the much less known\nlow-intensity high-velocity (absolute RV $>$50 km/s) gas emission.\n  We show that gas giving rise to H$\\alpha$ and He I emission is dynamically\nwell correlated, but not identical, to gas seen through forbidden-line\nemission. Gas temperatures are derived from line-width ratios, and densities\nfrom [S II] doublet ratios. The spatial variation of N ionization is also\nstudied, and found to differ between the approaching and receding components.\nThe main result is that the bulk of the emission lines in the central part of\nCarina arises from several distinct shell-like expanding regions, the most\nevident found around $\\eta$ Car, the Trumpler 14 core, and the star WR25. Such\n\"shells\" are non-spherical, and show distortions probably caused by collisions\nwith other shells or colder, higher-density gas. Part of them is also obscured\nby foreground dust lanes, while only very little dust is found in their\ninterior. Preferential directions, parallel to the dark dust lanes, are found\nin the shell geometries and physical properties, probably related to strong\ndensity gradients in the studied region. We also find evidence that the\nionizing flux emerging from $\\eta$ Car and the surrounding Homunculus nebula\nvaries with polar angle. The high-velocity components in the wings of H$\\alpha$\nare found to arise from expanding dust reflecting the $\\eta$ Car spectrum.\n", "  We consider neutrino mixing and oscillations in presence of an arbitrary\nconstant magnetic field with nonzero transversal $B_{\\perp}$ and longitudinal\n$B_{\\parallel}$ components with respect to the direction of neutrino\npropagation. The electromagnetic interaction of neutrinos is determined by\ndiagonal and transition neutrino magnetic moments that are introduced for the\nneutrino mass states. Explicit expressions for the effective neutrino diagonal\nand transition magnetic moments for the flavor basis in terms of these values\nfor the mass states are obtained. The effective evolution Hamiltonian for the\nflavor neutrino and the corresponding oscillation probability are derived. The\nrole of the longitudinal magnetic field component is examined. In particular,\nit is shown that: 1) $B_{\\parallel}$ coupled to the corresponding magnetic\nmoments shifts the neutrino energy, and 2) in case of nonvanishing neutrino\ntransition magnetic moments $B_{\\parallel}$ produces an additional mixing\nbetween neutrino states, both in the mass and flavor neutrino bases.\n", "  Context. The classical \"planetesimal\" accretion scenario for the formation of\nplanets has recently evolved with the idea that \"pebbles\", centimeter- to\nmeter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control\nplanetesimal and/or planetary growth.\n  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and\naffects the formation of planetary systems\n  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary\nembryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the\npebble flow and reflect disk structure.\n  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the\nso-called \"settling\" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in\nsize. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion\nmode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into\naccount, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo\nmass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,\ni.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the\nradial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of\nthe power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk\nheating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes\nor Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.\nWe also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside\nthe snow line.\n  Conclusions. Pebble accretion easily produces a large diversity of planetary\nsystems. In other words, to correctly infer the results of planet formation\nthrough pebble accretion, detailed prescriptions of disk evolution and pebble\ngrowth, sublimation/destruction and migration are required.\n", "  Using the focusing equation, the equation for the cosmological angular\ndiameter distance is derived, based on the ideas of Academician Ya.B.\nZel'dovich, namely, that the distribution of matter at small angles is not\nhomogeneous, and the light cone is close to being empty. We propose some ways\nof testing a method for measuring the angular diameter distances and show that\nthe proposed method leads to results that agree better with the experimental\ndata than those obtained by the usual methods.\n", "  We update the method of the Holmberg & Flynn (2000) study, including an\nupdated model of the Milky Way's interstellar gas, radial velocities, an\nupdated reddening map, and a careful statistical analysis, to bound the allowed\nsurface density and scale height of a dark disk. We pay careful attention to\nthe self-consistency of the model, including the gravitational influence of the\ndark disk on other disk components, and to the net velocity of the tracer\nstars. We find that the data set exhibits a non-zero bulk velocity in the\nvertical direction as well as a displacement from the expected location at the\nGalactic midplane. If not properly accounted for, these features would bias the\nbound toward low dark disk mass. We therefore perform our analysis two ways. In\nthe first, traditional method, we subtract the mean velocity and displacement\nfrom the tracers' phase space distributions. In the second method, we perform a\nnon-equilibrium version of the HF method to derive a bound on the dark disk\nparameters for an oscillating tracer distribution. Despite updates in the mass\nmodel and reddening map, the traditional method results remain consistent with\nthose of HF2000. The second, non-equilibrium technique, however, allows a\nsurface density as large as $14\\, M_\\odot\\,{\\rm pc}^{-2}$ (and as small as 0),\ndemonstrating much weaker constraints. For both techniques, the bound on\nsurface density is weaker for larger scale height. In future analyses of Gaia\ndata, it will be important to verify whether the tracer populations are in\nequilibrium.\n", "  Using two-dimensional simulations, we numerically explore the dependences of\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability upon various physical parameters, including\nviscosity, width of sheared layer, flow speed, and magnetic field strength. In\nmost cases, a multi-vortex phase exists between the initial growth phase and\nfinal single-vortex phase. The parametric study shows that the evolutionary\nproperties, such as phase duration and vortex dynamics, are generally sensitive\nto these parameters except in certain regimes. An interesting result is that\nfor supersonic flows, the phase durations and saturation of velocity growth\napproach constant values asymptotically as the sonic Mach number increases. We\nconfirm that the linear coupling between magnetic field and Kelvin-Helmholtz\nmodes is negligible if the magnetic field is weak enough. The morphological\nbehaviour suggests that the multi-vortex coalescence might be driven by the\nunderlying wave-wave interaction. Based on these results, we make a preliminary\ndiscussion about several events observed in the solar corona. The numerical\nmodels need to be further improved to make a practical diagnostic of the\ncoronal plasma properties.\n", "  The high precision measurement of the hyperfine splitting of the\nmuonic-hydrogen atom ground state with pulsed and intense muon beam requires\ncareful technological choices both in the construction of a gas target and of\nthe detectors. In June 2014, the pressurized gas target of the FAMU experiment\nwas exposed to the low energy pulsed muon beam at the RIKEN RAL muon facility.\nThe objectives of the test were the characterization of the target, the\nhodoscope and the X-ray detectors. The apparatus consisted of a beam hodoscope\nand X-rays detectors made with high purity Germanium and Lanthanum Bromide\ncrystals. In this paper the experimental setup is described and the results of\nthe detector characterization are presented.\n", "  We study the impact of bound state formation on dark matter annihilation\nrates in models where dark matter interacts via a light mediator, the dark\nphoton. We derive the general cross section for radiative capture into all\npossible bound states, and point out its non-trivial dependence on the dark\nmatter velocity and the dark photon mass. For indirect detection, our result\nshows that dark matter annihilation inside bound states can play an important\nrole in enhancing signal rates over the rate for direct dark matter\nannihilation with Sommerfeld enhancement. The effects are strongest for large\ndark gauge coupling and when the dark photon mass is smaller than the typical\nmomentum of dark matter in the galaxy. As an example, we show that for thermal\ndark matter the Fermi gamma ray constraint is substantially increased once\nbound state effects are taken into account. We also find that bound state\neffects are not important for dark matter annihilation during the freeze out\nand recombination epochs.\n", "  We investigate the steady-state out-of-plane spin diffusion in p-type bilayer\nWSe2 in the presence of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Hartree-Fock\neffective magnetic field. The out-of-plane components of the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling serve as the opposite Zeeman-like fields in the two valleys. Together\nwith the identical Hartree-Fock effective magnetic fields, different total\neffective magnetic field strengths in the two valleys are obtained. It is\nfurther revealed that due to the valley-dependent total effective magnetic\nfield strength, similar (different) spin-diffusion lengths in the two valleys\nare observed at small (large) spin injection. Nevertheless, it is shown that\nthe intervalley hole-phonon scattering can suppress the difference in the\nspin-diffusion lengths at large spin injection due to the spin-conserving\nintervalley charge transfers with the opposite transfer directions between\nspin-up and -down holes. Moreover, with a fixed large pure spin injection, we\npredict the build-up of a steady-state valley polarization during the spin\ndiffusion with the maximum along the diffusion direction being capable of\nexceeding 1 %. It is revealed that the valley polarization arises from the\ninduced quasi hot-hole Fermi distributions with different effective hot-hole\ntemperatures between spin-up and -down holes during the spin diffusion, leading\nto the different intervalley charge transfer rates in the opposite transfer\ndirections. Additionally, it is also shown that by increasing the injected spin\npolarization, the hole density or the impurity density, the larger valley\npolarization can be obtained.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation\n(SER) between diffusivity and viscosity in undercooled melts. A binary\nLennard-Jones system, as a model for a metallic melt, is studied by molecular\ndynamics. A weak breakdown at high temperatures can be understood from the\ncollectivization of motion, seen in the isotope effect. The strong breakdown at\nlower temperatures is connected to an increase in dynamic heterogeneity. On\nrelevant timescales some particles diffuse much faster than the average or than\npredicted by the SER. The van-Hove self correlation function allows to\nunambiguously identify slow particles. Their diffusivity is even less than\npredicted by the SER. The time-span of these particles being slow particles,\nbefore their first conversion to be a fast one, is larger than the decay time\nof the stress correlation. The contribution of the slow particles to the\nviscosity rises rapidly upon cooling. Not only the diffusion but also the\nviscosity shows a dynamically heterogeneous scenario. We can define a \"slow\"\nviscosity. The SER is recovered as relation between slow diffusivity and slow\nviscosity.\n", "  The gas temperature structure of protoplanetary disks is a key ingredient for\ninterpreting various disk observations and for quantifying the subsequent\nevolution of these systems. The comparison of low- and mid-$J$ CO rotational\nlines is a powerful tool to assess the temperature gradient in the warm\nmolecular layer of disks. Spectrally resolved high-$J$ ($J_{\\rm u} > 14$) CO\nlines probe intermediate distances and heights from the star that are not\nsampled by (sub-)millimeter CO spectroscopy. This paper presents new {\\it\nHerschel}/HIFI and archival PACS observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and \\cii\n\\ emission in 4 Herbig AeBe (HD 100546, HD 97048, IRS 48, HD 163296) and 3 T\nTauri (AS 205, S CrA, TW Hya) disks. In the case of the T Tauri systems AS 205\nand S CrA, the CO emission has a single-peaked profile, likely due to a slow\nwind. For all other systems, the {\\it Herschel} CO spectra are consistent with\npure disk emission and the spectrally-resolved lines (HIFI) and the CO\nrotational ladder (PACS) are analyzed simultaneously assuming power-law\ntemperature and column density profiles, using the velocity profile to locate\nthe emission in the disk. The temperature profile varies substantially from\ndisk to disk. In particular, $T_{\\rm gas}$ in the disk surface layers can\ndiffer by up to an order of magnitude among the 4 Herbig AeBe systems with HD\n100546 being the hottest and HD 163296 the coldest disk of the sample. Clear\nevidence of a warm disk layer where $T_{\\rm gas} > T_{\\rm dust}$ is found in\nall the Herbig Ae disks. The observed CO fluxes and line profiles are compared\nto predictions of physical-chemical models. The primary parameters affecting\nthe disk temperature structure are the flaring angle, the gas-to-dust mass\nratio the scale height and the dust settling.\n", "  The globular cluster HP~1 is projected at only 3.33 degrees from the Galactic\ncenter. Together with its distance, this makes it one of the most central\nglobular clusters in the Milky Way. It has a blue horizontal branch (BHB) and a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.0. This means that it probably is one of the oldest\nobjects in the Galaxy. Abundance ratios can reveal the nucleosynthesis pattern\nof the first stars as well as the early chemical enrichment and early formation\nof stellar populations. High-resolution spectra obtained for six stars were\nanalyzed to derive the abundances of the light elements C, N, O, Na, and Al,\nthe alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and the heavy elements Sr, Y , Zr, Ba,\nLa, and Eu.} High-resolution spectra of six red giants that are confirmed\nmembers of the bulge globular cluster HP~1 were obtained with the 8m VLT\nUT2-Kueyen telescope with the UVES spectrograph in FLAMES-UVES configuration.\nThe spectroscopic parameter derivation was based on the excitation and\nionization equilibrium of FeI and FeII. We confirm a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]\n= -1.06~0.10, by adding the two stars that were previously analyzed in HP~1.\nThe alpha-elements O and Mg are enhanced by about +0.3<[O,Mg/Fe]<+0.5 dex, Si\nis moderately enhanced with +0.15<[Si/Fe]<+0.35dex, while Ca and Ti show lower\nvalues of -0.04<[Ca,Ti/Fe]<+0.28dex. The r-element Eu is also enhanced with\n[Eu/Fe]~+0.4, which together with O and Mg is indicative of early enrichment by\ntype II supernovae. Na and Al are low, but it is unclear if Na-O are\nanticorrelated. The heavy elements are moderately enhanced, with\n-0.20<[La/Fe]<+0.43dex and 0.0<[Ba/Fe]<+0.75~dex, which is compatible with\nr-process formation. The spread in Y, Zr, Ba, and La abundances, on the other\nhand, appears to be compatible with the spinstar scenario or other additional\nmechanisms such as the weak r-process.\n", "  We propose a new approach to the resummation of the transverse-momentum\ndistribution of a high-mass colour-singlet system in hadronic collisions. The\nresummation is performed in momentum space and is free of kinematic\nsingularities at small transverse momentum. We derive a formula accurate at the\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic level, and present the first matched\npredictions to next-to-next-to-leading order for Higgs-boson production in\ngluon fusion at the LHC. This method can be adapted to all observables\nfeaturing kinematic cancellations in the infrared region.\n", "  The microscopic magnetism in the helical, the conical and the\nferro-magnetically polarized phases in an itinerant helical magnet, MnSi, has\nbeen studied by an extended 29Si NMR at zero field and under external magnetic\nfields. The temperature dependence of staggered moment, M_Q(T), determined by\nthe 29Si NMR frequency, nu(T), and nuclear relaxation rate, 1/T_1(T) is in\ngeneral accord with the SCR theory for weak itinerant ferromagnetic metals and\nits extension. The external field dependence of resonance frequency, nu(H),\nfollows a vector sum of the contributions from atomic hyperfine and macroscopic\nfields with a field induced moment characteristic to the itinerant magnets. A\ndiscontinuous jump of the resonance frequency at the critical field, H_c,\nbetween the conical and the polarized phases has also been found that suggests\na first order like change of the electronic states at H_c.\n", "  We present a theoretical description of the effect of polyvalent ions on the\ninteraction between titratable macro-ions. The model system consists of two\npoint-like macro-ions with dissociable sites, immersed in an asymmetric ionic\nmixture of monovalent and polyvalent salts. We formulate a {\\em dressed ion\nstrong coupling theory}, based on the decomposition of the asymmetric ionic\nmixture into a weakly electrostatically coupled monovalent salt, and into\npolyvalent ions that are strongly electrostatically coupled to the titratable\nmacro-ions. The charge of the macroions is not considered as fixed, but is\nallowed to respond to local bathing solution parameters (electrostatic\npotential, $pH$ of the solution, salt concentration) through a simple {\\em\ncharge regulation} model. The approach presented, yielding an effective\npolyvalent-ion mediated interaction between charge-regulated macro-ions at\nvarious solution conditions, describes the strong coupling equivalent of the\nKirkwood-Schumaker interaction.\n", "  We present the Spitzer Data Fusion, a database incorporating far-ultraviolet\nto far-infrared flux measurements as well as photometric and spectroscopic\nredshifts for 4.4 million IRAC-selected sources detected over 8 extragalactic\nfields covering 65 deg$^2$ observed by Spitzer in all IRAC and MIPS bands\nduring its cryogenic mission. Deeper Spitzer observations carried out during\nits warm mission over 5 sub-fields as part of the SERVS project are also\npresented and analysed in a similar fashion, detecting 2.8 million\nIRAC-selected sources over 18 deg$^2$ and merging them with multi-wavelength\ncatalogues within the SERVS Data Fusion. When combined with Herschel SPIRE\nsurveys and radio continuum observations over the same fields, the Spitzer Data\nFusion and the SERVS Data Fusion provide an invaluable resource for\nmulti-wavelength galaxy formation and evolution studies at\ninfrared/millimetre/radio wavelengths. The catalogues and their future updates\nwill be released at http://www.mattiavaccari.net/df/ and on CDS/VizieR.\n", "  The treatment of angles within the SI is anomalous compared with other\nquantities, and there is a case for removing this anomaly by declaring plane\nangle to be an additional base quantity within the system. It is shown that\nthis could bring several benefits in terms of treating angle on an equal basis\nwith other metrics, removing potentially harmful ambiguities, and bringing SI\nunits more in line with concepts in basic physics, but at the expense of\nsignificant upheaval to familiar equations within mathematics and physics. This\npaper sets out the most important of these changes so that an alternative unit\nsystem containing angle as a base quantity can be seen in the round,\nirrespective of whether it is ever widely adopted. The alternative formulas and\nunits can be treated as the underlying, more general equations of mathematical\nphysics, independent of the units used for angle, which are conventionally\nsimplified by implicitly assuming that the unit used for angle is the radian.\n", "  The analysis of high-precision $\\pi^{\\pm}p \\to \\pi^{\\pm}p$ cross section data\nfrom the EPECUR Collaboration based on the multichannel $K$-matrix approach is\npresented.The sharp structures seen in these data are studied in terms of both\nopening thresholds and new resonance contributions. Some prominent features are\nfound to be due to the opening $K\\Sigma$ channel. However, a complete\ndescription of the data is improved with the addition of two narrow resonant\nstructures at $W\\sim 1.686$ and $W\\sim 1.720$ GeV. These structures are\ninterpreted as manifestations of $S_{11}$ and $P_{11}$ resonances. The\nunderlying nature of the observed phenomena is discussed.\n", "  We review our high-time-resolution radio observations of the Crab pulsar and\ncompare our data to a variety of models for the emission physics. The Main\nPulse and the Low-Frequency Interpulse come from regions somewhere in the\nhigh-altitude emission zones (caustics) that also produce pulsed X-ray and\ngamma-ray emission. Although no emission model can fully explain these two\ncomponents, the most likely models suggest they arise from a combination of\nbeam-driven instabilities, coherent charge bunching and strong electromagnetic\nturbulence. Because the radio power fluctuates on a wide range of timescales,\nwe know the emission zones are patchy and dynamic. It is tempting to invoke\nunsteady pair creation in high-altitude gaps as source of the variability, but\ncurrent pair cascade models cannot explain the densities required by any of the\nlikely models. It is harder to account for the mysterious High-Frequency\nInterpulse. We understand neither its origin within the magnetosphere nor the\nstriking emission bands in its dynamic spectrum. The most promising models are\nbased on analogies with solar zebra bands, but they require unusual plasma\nstructures which are not part of our standard picture of the magnetosphere. We\nargue that radio observations can reveal much about the upper magnetosphere,\nbut work is required before the models can address all of the data.\n", "  An unusual growth mechanism of metastable zincblende AlN thin film by\ndiffusion of nitrogen atoms into Al lattice is established. Using\nfirst-principles density functional theory, we studied the possibility of\nthermodynamic stability of AlN as a zincblende phase due to epitaxial strains\nand interface effect, which fails to explain the formation of zincblende AlN.\nWe then compared the formation energetics of rocksalt and zincblende AlN in fcc\nAl through direct diffusion of nitrogen atoms to Al octahedral and tetrahedral\ninterstitials. The formation of zincblende AlN thin film is determined to be a\nkinetically driven process, not a thermodynamically driven process.\n", "  Optical studies of a bright exciton provide only limited information about\nthe hole anisotropy in a quantum dot. In this work we present a universal\nmethod to study heavy hole anisotropy using a dark exciton in a moderate\nin-plane magnetic field. By analysis of the linear polarization of the dark\nexciton photoluminescence we identify both isotropic and anisotropic\ncontributions to the hole g-factor. We employ this method for a number of\nindividual self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, demonstrating a variety of\nbehaviors of in-plane hole g-factor: from almost fully anisotropic to almost\nisotropic. We conclude that, in general, both contributions play an important\nrole and neither contribution can be neglected.\n", "  We review thermodynamic properties of modified gravity theories such as\n$F(R)$ gravity and $f(T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $T$ is\nthe torsion scalar in teleparallelism. In particular, we explore the\nequivalence between the equations of motion for modified gravity theories and\nthe Clausius relation in thermodynamics. In addition, thermodynamics of the\ncosmological apparent horizon is investigated in $f(T)$ gravity. We show both\nequilibrium and non-equilibrium descriptions of thermodynamics. It is\ndemonstrated that the second law of thermodynamics in the universe can be met\nwhen the temperature of the outside of the apparent horizon is equivalent to\nthat of the inside of it.\n"]}
