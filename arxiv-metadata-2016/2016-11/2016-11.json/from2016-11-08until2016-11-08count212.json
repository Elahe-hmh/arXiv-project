Such a limit,\nunattainable by particles, represents a preferred reference frame associated\nwith a universal background field that breaks Lorentz symmetry. Thus the\nstructure of space-time is extended due to the presence of a vacuum energy\ndensity, which leads to a negative pressure at cosmological scales. The tiny\nvalues of the cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density shall be\nsuccessfully obtained, being in good agreement with current observational\nresults.\n", "  The anomalous conformal transformation law of the generalized entropy is\nfound for dilaton gravity coupled to a 1+1 conformal matter sector with central\ncharges $c = \\tilde{c}$. (When $c \\ne \\tilde{c}$ the generalized entropy is not\ninvariant under local Lorentz boosts.) It is shown that a certain second null\nderivative of the entropy, $S_\\text{gen}\" + (6/c)(S_\\text{out}')^2$, is\nprimary, and therefore retains its sign under a general conformal\ntransformation. Consequently all conformal vacua have increasing entropy on\ncausal horizons. Alternative definitions of the horizon, including apparent or\ndynamical horizons, can have decreasing entropy in any dimension $D \\ge 2$.\nThis indicates that the generalized second law should be defined using the\ncausal horizon.\n", "  Manifolds with exceptional holonomy play an important role in string theory,\nsupergravity and M-theory. It is explained how one can find the holonomy\nalgebra of an arbitrary Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold. Using the de~Rham\nand Wu decompositions, this problem is reduced to the case of locally\nindecomposable manifolds. In the case of locally indecomposable Riemannian\nmanifolds, it is known that the holonomy algebra can be found from the analysis\nof special geometric structures on the manifold. If the holonomy algebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}\\subset\\mathfrak{so}(1,n-1)$ of a locally indecomposable\nLorentzian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n$ is different from\n$\\mathfrak{so}(1,n-1)$, then it is contained in the similitude algebra\n$\\mathfrak{sim}(n-2)$. There are 4 types of such holonomy algebras. Criterion\nhow to find the type of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are given, and special geometric\nstructures corresponding to each type are described. To each $\\mathfrak{g}$\nthere is a canonically associated subalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{h}\\subset\\mathfrak{so}(n-2)$. An algorithm how to find\n$\\mathfrak{h}$ is provided.\n", "  Measurements of cross sections of inelastic and diffractive processes in\nproton--proton collisions at LHC energies were carried out with the ALICE\ndetector. The fractions of diffractive processes in inelastic collisions were\ndetermined from a study of gaps in charged particle pseudorapidity\ndistributions: for single diffraction (diffractive mass $M_X < 200$ GeV/$c^2$)\n$\\sigma_{\\rm SD}/\\sigma_{\\rm INEL} = 0.21 \\pm 0.03, 0.20^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$, and\n$0.20^{+0.04}_{-0.07}$, respectively at centre-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} =\n0.9, 2.76$, and 7~TeV; for double diffraction (for a pseudorapidity gap\n$\\Delta\\eta > 3$) $\\sigma_{\\rm DD}/\\sigma_{\\rm INEL} = 0.11 \\pm 0.03, 0.12 \\pm\n0.05$, and $0.12^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, respectively at $\\sqrt{s} = 0.9, 2.76$, and\n7~TeV. To measure the inelastic cross section, beam properties were determined\nwith van der Meer scans, and, using a simulation of diffraction adjusted to\ndata, the following values were obtained: $\\sigma_{\\rm INEL} =\n62.8^{+2.4}_{-4.0} (model) \\pm 1.2 (lumi)$ mb at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 2.76~TeV and\n$73.2^{+2.0}_{-4.6} (model) \\pm 2.6 (lumi)$ mb at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7~TeV. The\nsingle- and double-diffractive cross sections were calculated combining\nrelative rates of diffraction with inelastic cross sections. The results are\ncompared to previous measurements at proton--antiproton and proton--proton\ncolliders at lower energies, to measurements by other experiments at the LHC,\nand to theoretical models.\n", "  We calculate the refined topological string partition function of the\nCalabi-Yau threefold which is the total space of the canonical bundle on\n$\\mathbb{P}^2$ (the local $\\mathbb{P}^2$). The refined topological vertex\nformalism can not be directly applied to local $\\mathbb{P}^2$ therefore we use\nthe properties of the refined Hopf link to define a new two legged vertex which\ntogether with the refined vertex gives the partition function of the local\n$\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n", "  We study `constrained generalized Killing (s)pinors', which characterize\nsupersymmetric flux compactifications of supergravity theories. Using geometric\nalgebra techniques, we give conceptually clear and computationally effective\nmethods for translating supersymmetry conditions into differential and\nalgebraic constraints on collections of differential forms. In particular, we\ngive a synthetic description of Fierz identities, which are an important\ningredient of such problems. As an application, we show how our approach can be\nused to efficiently recover results pertaining to N=1 compactifications of\nM-theory on eight-manifolds.\n", "  We summarize a unified and computationally efficient treatment of Fierz\nidentities for form-valued pinor bilinears in various dimensions and\nsignatures, using concepts and techniques borrowed from a certain approach to\nspinors known as geometric algebra. Our formulation displays the real, complex\nand quaternionic structures in a conceptually clear manner, which is moreover\namenable to implementation in various symbolic computation systems.\n", "  Understanding physics of gas giants requires the knowledge about the behavior\nof hydrogen at extreme pressures and temperatures. Molecular hydrogen in these\nplanets is supercritical, and has been considered as a physically homogeneous\nstate where no differences can be made between a liquid and a gas and where all\nproperties undergo no marked or distinct changes with pressure and temperature,\nthe picture believed to hold below the dissociation and metallization\ntransition. Here, we show that in Jupiter and Saturn, supercritical molecular\nhydrogen undergoes a dynamic transition around 10 GPa and 3000 K from the\n\"rigid\" liquid state to the \"non-rigid\" gas-like fluid state at the Frenkel\nline recently proposed, with accompanying qualitative changes of all major\nphysical properties. The consequences of this finding are discussed, including\na physically justified way to demarcate the interior and the atmosphere in gas\ngiants.\n", "  This article investigates the correlation structure of the global crude oil\nmarket using the daily returns of 71 oil price time series across the world\nfrom 1992 to 2012. We identify from the correlation matrix six clusters of time\nseries exhibiting evident geographical traits, which supports Weiner's (1991)\nregionalization hypothesis of the global oil market. We find that intra-cluster\npairs of time series are highly correlated while inter-cluster pairs have\nrelatively low correlations. Principal component analysis shows that most\neigenvalues of the correlation matrix locate outside the prediction of the\nrandom matrix theory and these deviating eigenvalues and their corresponding\neigenvectors contain rich economic information. Specifically, the largest\neigenvalue reflects a collective effect of the global market, other four\nlargest eigenvalues possess a partitioning function to distinguish the six\nclusters, and the smallest eigenvalues highlight the pairs of time series with\nthe largest correlation coefficients. We construct an index of the global oil\nmarket based on the eigenfortfolio of the largest eigenvalue, which evolves\nsimilarly as the average price time series and has better performance than the\nbenchmark $1/N$ portfolio under the buy-and-hold strategy.\n", "  We introduce several novel and computationally efficient methods for\ndetecting \"core--periphery structure\" in networks. Core--periphery structure is\na type of mesoscale structure that includes densely-connected core vertices and\nsparsely-connected peripheral vertices. Core vertices tend to be well-connected\nboth among themselves and to peripheral vertices, which tend not to be\nwell-connected to other vertices. Our first method, which is based on\ntransportation in networks, aggregates information from many geodesic paths in\na network and yields a score for each vertex that reflects the likelihood that\na vertex is a core vertex. Our second method is based on a low-rank\napproximation of a network's adjacency matrix, which can often be expressed as\na tensor-product matrix. Our third approach uses the bottom eigenvector of the\nrandom-walk Laplacian to infer a coreness score and a classification into core\nand peripheral vertices. We also design an objective function to (1) help\nclassify vertices into core or peripheral vertices and (2) provide a\ngoodness-of-fit criterion for classifications into core versus peripheral\nvertices. To examine the performance of our methods, we apply our algorithms to\nboth synthetically-generated networks and a variety of networks constructed\nfrom real-world data sets.\n", "  Follow-ship network among users underlies the diffusion dynamics of messages\non online social networks. Generally, the structure of underlying social\nnetwork determines the visibility of messages and the diffusion process. In\nthis paper, we study forwarding behavior of individuals, taking Sina Weibo as\nan example. We investigate multiple exposures in information diffusion and the\n\"forwarding whom\" problem associated with multiple exposures. Finally, we model\nand predict the \"forwarding whom\" behavior of individuals, combining\nstructural, temporal, historical, and content features. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves a high accuracy 91.3%.\n", "  It has long been known that some microswimmers seem to swim\ncounter-intuitively faster when the viscosity of the surrounding fluid is\nincreased, whereas others slow down. This conflicting dependence of the\nswimming velocity on the viscosity is poorly understood theoretically. Here we\nexplain that any mechanical microswimmer with an elastic degree of freedom in a\nsimple Newtonian fluid can exhibit both kinds of response to an increase in the\nfluid viscosity for different viscosity ranges, if the driving is weak. The\nvelocity response is controlled by a single parameter $\\varGamma$, the ratio of\nthe relaxation time of the elastic component of the swimmer in the viscous\nfluid and the swimming stroke period. This defines two velocity-viscosity\nregimes, which we characterize using the bead-spring microswimmer model and\nanalyzing the different forces acting on the parts of this swimmer. The\nanalytical calculations are supported by lattice-Boltzmann simulations, which\naccurately reproduce the two velocity regimes for the predicted values of\n$\\varGamma$.\n", "  Using the well-known \"algebra of multifractality\", we derive the functional\nequation for anomalous dimensions \\Delta_q, whose solution \\Delta_q=aq(q-1)\ncorresponds to strict parabolicity of the multifractal spectrum. This result\ndemonstrates clearly that a correspondence of \\sigma-models with the initial\ndisordered systems is not exact.\n", "  We study theoretically the influence of spin accumulation on\nsuperconductivity in a superconductor/ferromagnet bilayer. It is well-known\nthat the superconductivity in S/F bilayers is suppressed by the proximity to a\nferromagnet. The spin accumulation by itself is also a depairing factor. But\nhere we show that creation of the spin accumulation on top of effective\nexchange depairing, caused by the proximity to a ferromagnet, can lead to an\nopposite result. The superconductivity can be partially recovered by\nspin-dependent quasiparticle distribution. The systems with realistic\nparameters are considered and the possible experimental setup is proposed.\n", "  This paper develops a method to carry out the large-$N$ asymptotic analysis\nof a class of $N$-dimensional integrals arising in the context of the so-called\nquantum separation of variables method. We push further ideas developed in the\ncontext of random matrices of size $N$, but in the present problem, two scales\n$1/N^{\\alpha}$ and $1/N$ naturally occur. In our case, the equilibrium measure\nis $N^{\\alpha}$-dependent and characterised by means of the solution to a\n$2\\times 2$ Riemann--Hilbert problem, whose large-$N$ behavior is analysed in\ndetail. Combining these results with techniques of concentration of measures\nand an asymptotic analysis of the Schwinger-Dyson equations at the\ndistributional level, we obtain the large-$N$ behavior of the free energy\nexplicitly up to $o(1)$. The use of distributional Schwinger-Dyson is a novelty\nthat allows us treating sufficiently differentiable interactions and the mixing\nof scales $1/N^{\\alpha}$ and $1/N$, thus waiving the analyticity assumptions\noften used in random matrix theory.\n", "  We use the technique of chopped nonlinear magneto-optic rotation (NMOR) in a\nroom temperature $^{133}$Cs vapor cell to measure the permanent electric dipole\nmoment (EDM) in the atom. The cell has paraffin coating on the walls to\nincrease the relaxation time. The signature of the EDM is a shift in the Larmor\nprecession frequency which is correlated with the application of an E field. We\nanalyze errors in the technique, and show that the main source of systematic\nerror is the appearance of a longitudinal B field when the E field is applied.\nThis error can be eliminated by doing measurements on the two ground hyperfine\nlevels. Using an E field of 2.6 kV/cm, we place an upper limit on the electron\nEDM of $ 2.9 \\times 10^{-22} $ e-cm ($95 \\%$ confidence). This limit can be\nincreased by 7 orders-of-magnitude---and brought below the current best\nexperimental value---with easily implementable improvements to the technique.\n", "  We introduce a class of commutative superalgebras generalizing cluster\nalgebras. A cluster superalgebra is defined by a hypergraph called an \"extended\nquiver\", and transformations called mutations. We prove the super analog of the\n\"Laurent phenomenon\", i.e., that all elements of a given cluster superalgebra\nare Laurent polynomials in the initial variables, and find an invariant\npresymplectic form. Examples of cluster superalgebras are provided by\nsuperanalogs of Coxeter's frieze patterns. We apply the Laurent phenomenon to\nconstruct a new integer sequence extending the Somos-$4$ sequence.\n", "  The fully nonlinear notion of resonance -$\\textit{geometrical resonance}$- in\nthe general context of dissipative systems subjected to $\\textit{nonsteady}$\npotentials is discussed. It is demonstrated that there is an exact local\ninvariant associated with each geometrical resonance solution which reduces to\nthe system's energy when the potential is steady. The geometrical resonance\nsolutions represent a \\textit{local symmetry} whose critical breaking leads to\na new analytical criterion for the order-chaos threshold. This physical\ncriterion is deduced in the co-moving frame from the local energy conservation\nover the shortest significant timescale. Remarkably, the new criterion for the\nonset of chaos is shown to be valid over large regions of parameter space, thus\nbeing useful beyond the perturbative regime and the scope of current\nmathematical techniques.\n", "  For the first time, we have observed the annihilation of multiple eigenstates\nof the parent potentials and redistribution of the energy in the deformed\npotentials in the system with spontaneously breaking of parity-time symmetry\nwhile preserving the SUSY of the system. We have observed that the deformation\nof the potentials is sensitive to initial conditions. This first experimental\nobservation enables the localization of eigenspectra in lateral space\n(so-called time) and the localization of eigenstates in longitudinal space in\nthe deformed potentials by experimentally applying the SUSY higher-order\ntransformations on tilted and disordered parent potentials, respectively. The\nformer shows a decrease in the slope of the profile of eigenspectrum (bands)\ndue to the localization in lateral space, while the latter shows an increase in\nthe slope due to localization in longitudinal space. This allows the formation\nof deterministic bandgaps and Bloch waves while retaining the SUSY. In this\nconfiguration, the phase transition emerges naturally in the SUSY deformed\npotentials, which are revealed as the quantum Zeno effect and a peculiar\nAnderson localization, respectively. The Anderson localization shows the\nfeatures of effective amplification and quantum Anti-Zeno effect. The\nexperimental results are in full agreement with the theory of SUSY deformed\npotentials of higher-order transformations. Besides enhancing the understanding\nof nature, our results can also provide an experimental platform to originate\nnew classes of effective and synthetic materials, and are also significantly\nimportant for unifying the interaction dynamics of condensed matter and\nphotonic systems, and the implementation of universal quantum computation.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian reduction and canonical quantization of a massive\nAdS$_2$ superparticle realized on the coset OSP(1|2)/SO(1,1). The phase space\nof the massive superparticle is represented as a coadjoint orbit of a timelike\nelement of $\\mathfrak{osp}$(1|2). This orbit has a well defined symplectic\nstructure and the OSP(1|2) symmetry is realized as the Poisson bracket algebra\nof the Noether charges. We then construct canonical coordinates given by one\nbosonic and one fermionic oscillator, whose quantization leads to the\nHolstein-Primakoff type realization of $\\mathfrak{osp}$(1|2). We also perform a\nsimilar analysis and discuss new features and inconsistencies in the massless\ncase.\n", "  We present a study of the effects of magnetic fields on fluctuations and\ncorrelations in hadron resonance gas model. We find significant changes in the\nfluctuations of net baryon number, electric charge and strangeness. This is\nalso reflected in various fluctuation ratios along the freezeout curve.\n", "  We have investigated low-temperature electronic transport on InAs/GaSb double\nquantum wells, a system which promises to be electrically tunable from a normal\nto a topological insulator. Hall bars of $50\\,\\mu$m in length down to a few\n$\\mu$m gradually develop a pronounced resistance plateau near\ncharge-neutrality, which comes along with distinct non-local transport along\nthe edges. Plateau resistances are found to be above or below the quantized\nvalue expected for helical edge channels. We discuss these results based on the\ninterplay between imperfect edges and residual local bulk conductivity.\n", "  Actomyosin actively generates contractile forces that provide the plasma\nmembrane with the deformation stresses essential to carry out biological\nprocesses. Although the contractile property of purified actomyosin has been\nextensively studied, to understand the physical contribution of the actiomyosin\ncontractile force on a deformable membrane is still a challenging problem and\nof great interest in the field of biophysics. Here, we reconstituted a model\nsystem with a cell-sized deformable interface that exhibits anomalous curvature\ndependent wrinkling caused by actomyosin cortex underneath the spherical closed\ninterface. Through the shape analysis of the wrinkling deformation, we found\nthat the dominant contributor on the wrinkled shape changes from bending\nelasticity to stretching elasticity of the reconstituted cortex by increasing\nthe droplet curvature radius of the order of the cell-size, i.e., tens of\nmicrometer. The observed curvature dependence was explained by the theoretical\ndescription of the cortex elasticity and contractility. Our present results\nprovide a fundamental insight on the deformation of a curved membrane induced\nby the actomyosin cortex.\n", "  We report on our ongoing effort to measure the Boltzmann constant, $k_B,$\nusing the Doppler broadening technique on ammonia. This paper presents some of\nthe improvements made to the mid-infrared spectrometer including the use of a\nphase-stabilized quantum cascade laser, a lineshape analysis based on a refined\nphysical model and an improved fitting program 2 increasing the confidence in\nour estimates of the relevant molecular parameters, and a first evaluation of\nthe saturation parameter and its impact on the measurement of k B. A summary of\nthe systematic effects contributing to the measurement is given and the optimal\nexperimental conditions for mitigating those effects in order to reach a\ncompetitive measurement of $k_B$ at a part per million accuracy level are\noutlined.\n", "  Recently we introduced T-duality in the study of topological insulators, and\nused it to show that T-duality trivialises the bulk-boundary correspondence in\n2 dimensions. In this paper, we partially generalise these results to higher\ndimensions and briefly discuss the 4D quantum Hall effect.\n", "  The swimming of a deformable planar slab in a viscous incompressible fluid is\nstudied on the basis of the Navier-Stokes equations. A continuum of plane wave\ndisplacements, symmetric on both sides of the slab and characterized by a\npolarization angle, allows optimization of the swimming efficiency with respect\nto polarization. The mean swimming velocity and mean rate of dissipation are\ncalculated to second order in the amplitude of the stroke. The optimum\nefficiency depends on the ratio of viscosity and mass density of the fluid. For\nhigh viscosity a stroke is found with significantly higher efficiency than\nTaylor's solution for a swimming sheet. For low viscosity the efficiency is\noptimal for a nearly irrotational flow pattern.\n", "  The the duality between ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM and the AdS$_5\\times\\;$S$^5$\nsuperstring appears to enjoy quantum integrability in the planar limit, which\nallowed to devise powerful methods ostensibly solving the spectral problem.\nHowever, quantization of the AdS$_5\\times\\;$S$^5$ superstring from first\nprinciples is still an open question and especially the spectrum of short\nstring states has previously been derived only at leading order in large 't\nHooft coupling. In this thesis we investigate possible routes to take the\nperturbative quantization of short string states beyond the leading order,\nwhere equally our aim is to gain better appreciation of the quantum symmetries\nat play. A prominent role is played by the lowest excited string states, dual\nto the Konishi supermultiplet, and we start by reviewing critically an asserted\nderivation of the Konishi anomalous dimension in the setup of pure spinor\nstring theory. Next, we study the bosonic AdS$_5\\times\\;$S$^5$ string in static\ngauge, where we construct a so-called single-mode string solution, which shows\nclassical integrability and invariance under the isometries\nSO(2,4)$\\;\\times\\;$SO(6) at the quantum level. Arguing heuristically about the\neffects of supersymmetry, we indeed recover the first non-trivial quantum\ncorrection to the Konishi anomalous dimension. We continue by implementing\nstatic gauge for the full AdS$_5\\times\\;$S$^5$ superstring and find elegant\nexpressions for the Lagrangian density and the supercharges. We then constrain\nour interest to the superparticle and, using two different methods, find\ncanonical coordinates at quadratic order in fermions. As the single-mode string\nis just the SO(2,4)$\\;\\times\\;$SO(6) orbit of the pulsating string, we conclude\nby applying orbit method quantization to the particle and spinning string\nsolutions in bosonic AdS$_3\\times\\;$S$^3$ yielding consistent results for the\nspectra.\n", "  Precision tests of the Standard Model (SM) require not only accurate\nexperiments, but also precise and reliable theoretical predictions. Triple\nvector boson production provides a unique opportunity to investigate the\nquartic gauge couplings and check the validity of the gauge principle in the\nSM. Since the tree-level predictions alone are inadequate to meet this demand,\nthe next-to-leading order (NLO) calculation becomes compulsory. In this paper,\nwe calculate the NLO QCD + NLO electroweak (EW) corrections to the $W^{\\pm}ZZ$\nproductions with subsequent leptonic decays at the $14~{\\rm TeV}$ LHC by\nadopting an improved narrow width approximation which takes into account the\noff-shell contributions and spin correlations from the $W^{\\pm}$- and $Z$-boson\nleptonic decays. The NLO QCD+EW corrected integrated cross sections for the\n$W^{\\pm}ZZ$ productions and some kinematic distributions of final products are\nprovided. The results show that both the NLO QCD and NLO EW corrections are\nsignificant. In the jet-veto event selection scheme with $p_{T,jet}^{cut} = 50~\n{\\rm GeV}$, the NLO QCD+EW relative corrections to the integrated cross section\nare $20.5\\%$ and $31.1\\%$, while the genuine NLO EW relative corrections are\n$-5.42\\%$ and $-4.58\\%$, for the $W^+ZZ$ and $W^-ZZ$ productions, respectively.\nWe also investigate the theoretical dependence of the integrated cross section\non the factorization/renormalization scale, and find that the scale uncertainty\nis underestimated at the LO due to the fact that the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$\nis not involved in the LO matrix elements.\n", "  The interaction force between likely charged particles/surfaces is usually\nrepulsive due to the Coulomb interaction. However, the counterintuitive\nlike-charge attraction in electrolytes has been frequently observed in\nexperiments, which has been theoretically debated for a long time. It is widely\nknown that the mean field Poisson-Boltzmann theory cannot explain or predict\nthis anomalous feature since it ignores many-body properties. In this paper, we\ndevelop efficient algorithm and perform the force calculation between two\ninterfaces using a set of self-consistent equations which properly takes into\naccount the electrostatic correlation and the dielectric-boundary effects. By\nsolving the equations and calculating the pressure with the Debye-charging\nprocess, we show that the self-consistent equations could be used to study the\nattraction between like-charge surfaces from weak-coupling to mediate-coupling\nregime, and that the attraction is due to the electrostatics-driven entropic\nforce which is significantly enhanced by the dielectric depletion of mobile\nions. A systematic investigation shows that the interaction forces can be tuned\nby material permittivity, ionic size and valence, and salt concentration, and\nthat the like-charge attraction exists only for specific regime of these\nparameters.\n", "  We construct the covariant effective field theory of gravity as an expansion\nin inverse powers of the Planck mass, identifying the leading and\nnext-to-leading quantum corrections. We determine the form of the effective\naction for the cases of pure gravity with cosmological constant as well as\ngravity coupled to matter. By means of heat kernel methods we renormalize and\ncompute the leading quantum corrections to quadratic order in a curvature\nexpansion. The final effective action in our covariant formalism is generally\nnon-local and can be readily used to understand the phenomenology on different\nspacetimes. In particular, we point out that on curved backgrounds the\nobservable leading quantum gravitational effects are less suppressed than on\nMinkowski spacetime.\n", "  It is shown that on the de Sitter manifolds the tachyonic geodesics are\nrestricted such that the classical tachyons cannot exist on this manifold at\nany time. On the contrary, the theory of the scalar quantum tachyons is free of\nany restriction. The tachyonic scalar and Dirac plane waves are deduced in this\ngeometry, pointing out that these are well-defined, behaving as tempered\ndistributions at any moment.\n", "  The spatial structure of single photons is becoming an extensively explored\nresource used for facilitating the free-space quantum key distribution and\nquantum computation as well as for benchmarking the limits of quantum\nentanglement generation with orbital angular momentum modes or reduction of the\nphoton free-space propagation speed. Albeit nowadays an accurate tailoring of\nphoton's spatial structure is routinely performed using methods employed for\nshaping classical optical beams, the reciprocal problem of retrieving the\nspatial phase-amplitude structure of an unknown single photon cannot be solved\nusing complimentary classical holography techniques exhibiting excellent\ninterferometric precision. Here we introduce a method to record a hologram of a\nsingle photon (HSP) probed by another reference photon, based on essentially\ndifferent concept of quantum interference between two-photon probability\namplitudes. Similarly to classical holograms, HSP encodes full information\nabout photon's \"shape\", i.e. its quantum wavefunction whose local amplitude and\nphase are retrieved in the demonstrated experiment.\n", "  In this work pion and kaon condensation in the framework of chiral\nperturbation theory is studied. I consider a system at vanishing temperature\nwith nonzero isospin chemical potential and strangeness chemical potential;\nmeson masses and mixing in the normal phase, the pion condensation phase and\nthe kaon condensation phase are described. There are differences with previous\nworks, but the results presented here are supported by both theory group\nanalysis and by direct calculations. Some pion decay channels in the normal and\nthe pion condensation phases are studied, finding a nonmonotonic behavior of\nthe $\\Gamma$ decay width as a function of $\\mu_I$.\n", "  We compute explicit formulae for the moments of the densities of the\neigenvalues of the classical $\\beta$-ensembles for finite matrix dimension as\nwell as the expectation values of the coefficients of the characteristic\npolynomials. In particular, the moments are linear combinations of averages of\nJack polynomials, whose coefficients are related to specific examples of Jack\ncharacters.\n", "  We consider the system of particles with equal charges and nearest neighbour\nCoulomb interaction on the interval. We study local properties of this system,\nin particular the distribution of distances between neighbouring charges. For\nzero temperature case there is sufficiently complete picture and we give a\nshort review. For Gibbs distribution the situation is more difficult and we\npresent two related results.\n", "  Multiple scattering of waves in disordered media is a nightmare whether it be\nfor detection or imaging purposes. The best approach so far to get rid of\nmultiple scattering is optical coherence tomography. It basically combines\nconfocal microscopy and coherence time-gating to discriminate ballistic photons\nfrom a predominant multiple scattering background. Nevertheless, the imaging\ndepth range remains limited to 1 mm at best in human soft tissues. Here we\npropose a matrix approach of optical imaging to push back this fundamental\nlimit. By combining a matrix discrimination of ballistic waves and iterative\ntime-reversal, we show both theoretically and experimentally an extension of\nthe imaging-depth limit by at least a factor two compared to optical coherence\ntomography. In particular, the reported experiment demonstrates imaging through\na strongly scattering layer from which only one reflected photon over 1000\nbillion is ballistic. This approach opens a new route towards ultra-deep tissue\nimaging.\n", "  The sterile neutrino is a viable dark matter candidate that can be produced\nin the early Universe via non-equilibrium processes, and would therefore\npossess a highly non-thermal spectrum of primordial velocities. In this paper\nwe analyse the process of structure formation with this class of dark matter\nparticles. To this end we construct primordial dark matter power spectra as a\nfunction of the lepton asymmetry, $L_6$, that is present in the primordial\nplasma and leads to resonant sterile neutrino production. We compare these\npower spectra with those of thermally produced dark matter particles and show\nthat resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are much colder than their thermal\nrelic counterparts. We also demonstrate that the shape of these power spectra\nis not determined by the free-streaming scale alone. We then use the power\nspectra as an input for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation in order to\npredict the number of luminous satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. By\nassuming that the mass of the Milky Way halo must be no more than\n$2\\times10^{12}M_{\\odot}$ (the adopted upper bound based on current\nastronomical observations) we are able to constrain the value of $L_6$ for\n$M_s\\le 8$~keV. We also show that the range of $L_6$ that is in best agreement\nwith the 3.5~keV line (if produced by decays of 7~keV sterile neutrino)\nrequires that the Milky Way halo has a mass no smaller than\n$1.5\\times10^{12}M_{\\odot}$. Finally, we compare the power spectra obtained by\ndirect integration of the Boltzmann equations for a non-resonantly produced\nsterile neutrino with the fitting formula of Viel~et~al. and find that the\nlatter significantly underestimates the power amplitude on scales relevant to\nsatellite galaxies.\n", "  A detailed Dirac's and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of Bonzom-Livine model\ndescribing gravity in three dimensions is performed. The full structure of the\nconstraints, the gauge transformations and the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw\nbrackets are found. In addition, we show that the Faddeev-Jackiw and Dirac's\nbrackets coincide to each other. Finally we discuss some remarks and prospects.\n", "  A theory of spin transport and spin detection in Zeeman-split superconducting\nfilms at low temperatures is developed. It is shown that an injection of\nspin-unpolarized quasiparticles into a Zeeman-split superconductor gives rise\nto a spin imbalance. The relaxation length of such a spin signal is determined\nby the energy relaxation length and can be extremely large as compared to the\nrelaxation length of spin-polarized quasiparticles. There can exist two types\nof signals: due to nonthermalized quasiparticle distribution and due to\nthermalized overheated electron distribution. They have different decay lengths\nand can be distinguished by their different dependencies on the applied\nvoltage. The decay length of the nonthermalized signal is determined by the\nelectron-electron scattering rate, renormalized due to superconductivity. The\ndecay length of the thermalized signal is determined by the length on which\nenergy leaves the electronic subsystem and can be very large under special\nconditions. Applications of the theory to recent experimental data on spin\nrelaxation in Zeeman-split and exchange-split superconductors are discussed. In\nparticular, it can explain the extremely high spin relaxation lengths,\nexperimentally observed in Zeeman-split superconductors, and their growth with\nthe magnetic field and with the applied voltage.\n", "  Exoplanet discoveries of recent years have provided a great deal of new data\nfor studying the bulk compositions of giant planets. Here we identify 47\ntransiting giant planets ($20 M_\\oplus < M < 20 M_{\\mathrm{J}}$) whose stellar\ninsolation is low enough ($F_* < 2\\times10^8\\; \\text{erg}\\; \\text{s}^{-1}\\;\n\\text{cm}^{-2}$, or roughly $T_\\text{eff} < 1000$) that they are not affected\nby the hot Jupiter radius inflation mechanism(s). We compute a set of new\nthermal and structural evolution models and use these models in comparison with\nproperties of the 47 transiting planets (mass, radius, age) to determine their\nheavy element masses. A clear correlation emerges between the planetary heavy\nelement mass $M_z$ and the total planet mass, approximately of the form $M_z\n\\propto \\sqrt{M}$. This finding is consistent with the core accretion model of\nplanet formation. We also study how stellar metallicity [Fe/H] affects\nplanetary metal-enrichment and find a weaker correlation than has been\npreviously reported from studies with smaller sample sizes. We confirm a strong\nrelationship between the planetary metal-enrichment relative to the parent star\n$Z_{\\rm planet}/Z_{\\rm star}$ and the planetary mass, but see no relation in\n$Z_{\\rm planet}/Z_{\\rm star}$ with planet orbital properties or stellar mass.\nThe large heavy element masses of many planets ($>50$ $M_{\\oplus}$) suggest\nsignificant amounts of heavy elements in H/He envelopes, rather than cores,\nsuch that metal-enriched giant planet atmospheres should be the rule. We also\ndiscuss a model of core-accretion planet formation in a one-dimensional disk\nand show that it agrees well with our derived relation between mass and $Z_{\\rm\nplanet}/Z_{\\rm star}$.\n", "  Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a technique for imaging celestial\nradio emissions by simultaneously observing a source from telescopes\ndistributed across Earth. The challenges in reconstructing images from fine\nangular resolution VLBI data are immense. The data is extremely sparse and\nnoisy, thus requiring statistical image models such as those designed in the\ncomputer vision community. In this paper we present a novel Bayesian approach\nfor VLBI image reconstruction. While other methods often require careful tuning\nand parameter selection for different types of data, our method (CHIRP)\nproduces good results under different settings such as low SNR or extended\nemission. The success of our method is demonstrated on realistic synthetic\nexperiments as well as publicly available real data. We present this problem in\na way that is accessible to members of the community, and provide a dataset\nwebsite (vlbiimaging.csail.mit.edu) that facilitates controlled comparisons\nacross algorithms.\n", "  We postulate a principle stating that the initial condition of a physical\nsystem is typically algorithmically independent of the dynamical law. We argue\nthat this links thermodynamics and causal inference. On the one hand, it\nentails behaviour that is similar to the usual arrow of time. On the other\nhand, it motivates a statistical asymmetry between cause and effect that has\nrecently postulated in the field of causal inference, namely, that the\nprobability distribution P(cause) contains no information about the conditional\ndistribution P(effect|cause) and vice versa, while P(effect) may contain\ninformation about P(cause|effect).\n", "  We introduce two extensions of the Segal-Bargmann coherent state transform\nfrom $L^2({\\mathbb R},dx)$ to Hilbert spaces of slice monogenic and axial\nmonogenic functions and study their properties. These two transforms are\nrelated by the dual Radon transform. Representation theoretic and quantum\nmechanical aspects of the new representations are studied.\n", "  The spatial and velocity distributions of dark matter particles in the Milky\nWay Halo affect the signals expected to be observed in searches for dark\nmatter. Results from direct detection experiments are often analyzed assuming a\nsimple isothermal distribution of dark matter, the Standard Halo Model (SHM).\nYet there has been skepticism regarding the validity of this simple model due\nto the complicated gravitational collapse and merger history of actual\ngalaxies. In this paper we compare the SHM to the results of cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to investigate whether or not\nthe SHM is a good representation of the true WIMP distribution in the analysis\nof direct detection data. We examine two Milky Way-like galaxies from the\nMaGICC cosmological simulations (a) with dark matter only and (b) with baryonic\nphysics included. The inclusion of baryons drives the shape of the DM halo to\nbecome more spherical and makes the velocity distribution of dark matter\nparticles less anisotropic especially at large heliocentric velocities, thereby\nmaking the SHM a better fit. We also note that we do not find a significant\ndisk-like rotating dark matter component in either of the two galaxy halos with\nbaryons that we examine, suggesting that dark disks are not a generic\nprediction of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that in the\nSolar neighborhood, the SHM is in fact a good approximation to the true dark\nmatter distribution in these cosmological simulations (with baryons) which are\nreasonable representations of the Milky Way, and hence can also be used for the\npurpose of dark matter direct detection calculations.\n", "  Galilean genesis is an alternative to inflation, in which the universe starts\nexpanding from Minkowski with the stable violation of the null energy\ncondition. In this paper, we discuss how the early universe is reheated through\nthe gravitational particle production at the trasition from the genesis phase\nto the subsequent phase where the kinetic energy of the scalar field is\ndominant. We then study the consequences of gravitational reheating after\nGalilean genesis on the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves. The\nresultant spectrum is strongly blue, and at high frequencies $\\Omega_{\\rm\ngw}\\propto f^3$ in terms of the energy density per unit logarithmic frequency.\nThough this cannot be detected in existing detctors, the amplitude can be as\nlarge as $\\Omega_{\\rm gw}\\sim 10^{-12}$ at $f\\sim 100\\,$MHz, providing a future\ntest of the genesis scenario. The analysis is performed within the framework of\ngeneralized Galilean genesis based on the Horndeski theory, which enables us to\nderive generic formulas.\n", "  We investigate the accuracy of the recently proposed nonclassical transport\nequation. This equation contains an extra independent variable compared to the\nclassical transport equation (the path-length $s$), and models particle\ntransport taking place in homogenized random media in which a particle's\ndistance-to-collision is not exponentially distributed. To solve the\nnonclassical equation one needs to know the $s$-dependent ensemble-averaged\ntotal cross section, $\\Sigma_t(\\mu,s)$, or its corresponding path-length\ndistribution function, $p(\\mu,s)$. We consider a 1-D spatially periodic system\nconsisting of alternating solid and void layers, randomly placed in the\n$x$-axis. We obtain an analytical expression for $p(\\mu,s)$ and use this result\nto compute the corresponding $\\Sigma_t(\\mu,s)$. Then, we proceed to numerically\nsolve the nonclassical equation for different test problems in rod geometry;\nthat is, particles can move only in the directions $\\mu=\\pm 1$. To assess the\naccuracy of these solutions, we produce \"benchmark\" results obtained by (i)\ngenerating a large number of physical realizations of the system, (ii)\nnumerically solving the transport equation in each realization, and (iii)\nensemble-averaging the solutions over all physical realizations. We show that\nthe numerical results validate the nonclassical model; the solutions obtained\nwith the nonclassical equation accurately estimate the ensemble-averaged scalar\nflux in this 1-D random periodic system, greatly outperforming the widely-used\natomic mix model in most problems.\n", "  We analyze a model of cold axion Dark Matter weakly coupled with a dark gluon\ncondensate, reproducing Dark Energy. We first review how to recover the Dark\nEnergy behavior using the functional renormalization group approach, and ground\nour study on the properties of the effective Lagrangian, to be determined\nnon-perturbatively. Then, within the context of $G_{SM}\\times SU(2)_{D}\\times\nU(1)_{PQ}$, we consider YMC interactions with QCD axions. We predict a transfer\nof Dark Energy density into Dark Matter density in a cosmological time that can\nbe tested in the next generation of experiments dedicated to Dark Energy\nmeasures.\n", "  UHECR and UHE neutrino map correlation seem to most inconclusive. We show\nhere that a few peculiar UHECR narrow clustering might be connected to a first\nUHE muon neutrino tracks. Moreover we discuss the best filtered and amplified\nUHE neutrino astronomy painted by up-going tau airshower. Their discover by new\nprojects could be reached soon.\n", "  A preliminary discussion is given of the prospects that gravitational-wave\nobservations of binary inspiral of black holes could reveal or constrain\nquantum modifications to black hole dynamics, such as are required to preserve\npostulates of quantum mechanics. Different proposals for such modifications are\ncharacterized by different scales, and the size of these scales relative to\nthose probed by observation of inspiral signals is important in determining the\nfeasibility of finding experimental signatures. Certain scenarios with strong\nquantum modifications in a region extending well outside the horizon are\nexpected to modify classical evolution, and distort the near-peak gravitational\nwave signal, suggesting a search for departures from waveforms predicted by\ngeneral relativity. The near agreement of the GW150914 signal with such\nwaveforms is discussed, and indicates constraints on some such scenarios.\nImportant strategies for more precise future tests are 1) to develop more\nprecise predictions from scenarios proposing quantum modifications, and 2)\nsearching for observed deviations from numerical relativity predictions via\nanalysis of gravity wave data, particularly focussing on the signal region\ncorresponding to plunge and merger.\n", "  Using a semiclassical model of photodetection with Poissonian noise and\ninsights from quantum metrology, we prove that linear optics and photon\ncounting can optimally estimate the separation between two incoherent point\nsources without regard to Rayleigh's criterion. The model is applicable to weak\nthermal or fluorescent sources as well as lasers.\n", "  The local granular rheology is investigated numerically in turbulent bedload\ntransport. Considering spherical particles, steady uniform configurations are\nsimulated using a coupled fluid-discrete-element model. The stress tensor is\ncomputed as a function of the depth for a series of simulations varying the\nShields number, the specific density and the particle diameter. The results are\nanalyzed in the framework of the $\\mu(I)$ rheology and exhibit a collapse of\nboth the shear to normal stress ratio and the solid volume fraction over a wide\nrange of inertial numbers. Contrary to expectations, the effect of the\ninterstitial fluid on the granular rheology is shown to be negligible,\nsupporting recent work suggesting the absence of a clear transition between the\nfree-fall and turbulent regime. In addition, data collapse is observed up to\nunexpectedly high inertial numbers $I\\sim2$, challenging the existing\nconceptions and parametrization of the $\\mu(I)$ rheology. Focusing upon bedload\ntransport modelling, the results are pragmatically analyzed in the $\\mu(I)$\nframework in order to propose a granular rheology for bedload transport. The\nproposed rheology is tested using a 1D volume-averaged two-phase continuous\nmodel, and is shown to accurately reproduce the dense granular flow profiles\nand the sediment transport rate over a wide range of Shields numbers. The\npresent contribution represents a step in the upscaling process from\nparticle-scale simulations toward large-scale applications involving complex\nflow geometry.\n", "  Evidence is presented in support of an unconventional $3+3$ model of the\nneutrino mass eigenstates with specific $m^2>0$ and $m^2<0$ masses. The two\nlarge $m^2>0$ masses of the model were originally suggested based on a SN 1987A\nanalysis, and they were further supported by several dark matter fits. The new\nevidence for one of the $m^2>0$ mass values comes from an analysis of published\ndata from the $\\emph{three}$ most precise tritium $\\beta-$decay experiments.\nThe KATRIN experiment by virtue of a unique 3-part signature should either\nconfirm or reject the model in its entirety.\n", "  In this article we present a way of treating stochastic partial differential\nequations with multiplicative noise by rewriting them as stochastically\nperturbed evolutionary equations in the sense of \\cite{picardbook}, where a\ngeneral solution theory for deterministic evolutionary equations has been\ndeveloped. This allows us to present a unified solution theory for a general\nclass of SPDEs which we believe has great potential for further\ngeneralizations. We will show that many standard stochastic PDEs fit into this\nclass as well as many other SPDEs such as the stochastic Maxwell equation and\ntime-fractional stochastic PDEs with multiplicative noise on sub-domains of\n$\\Rd$. The approach is in spirit similar to the approach in\n\\cite{dapratozabczyk}, but complementing it in the sense that it does not\ninvolve semi-group theory and allows for an effective treatment of coupled\nsystems of SPDEs. In particular, the existence of a (regular) fundamental\nsolution or Green's function is not required.\n", "  Efforts have been ongoing to establish superconducting spintronics utilizing\nferromagnet/superconductor heterostructures1. Previously reported devices are\nbased on spin-singlet superconductors (SSCs), where the spin degree of freedom\nis lost. Spin-polarized supercurrent induction in ferromagnetic metals (FMs) is\nachieved even with SSCs, but only with the aid of interfacial complex magnetic\nstructures, which severely affect information imprinted to the electron spin.\nUse of spin-triplet superconductors (TSCs) with active spins potentially\novercomes this difficulty and further leads to novel functionalities. Here, we\nreport spin-triplet superconductivity induction into a FM SrRuO3 from a leading\nTSC candidate Sr2RuO4, by fabricating microscopic devices using an epitaxial\nSrRuO3/Sr2RuO4 hybrid. The differential conductance, exhibiting\nAndreev-reflection features with multiple energy scales up to around half\ntesla, indicates the penetration of superconductivity over a considerable\ndistance of 15 nm across the SrRuO3 layer without help of interfacial complex\nmagnetism. This demonstrates the first FM/TSC device exhibiting the\nspin-triplet proximity effect.\n", "  Ballistic electron transport is a key requirement for existence of a\ntopological phase transition in proximitized InSb nanowires. However,\nmeasurements of quantized conductance as direct evidence of ballistic transport\nhave so far been obscured due to the increased chance of backscattering in one\ndimensional nanowires. We show that by improving the nanowire-metal interface\nas well as the dielectric environment we can consistently achieve conductance\nquantization at zero magnetic field. Additionally, studying the sub-band\nevolution in a rotating magnetic field reveals an orbital degeneracy between\nthe second and third sub-bands for perpendicular fields above 1T.\n", "  Studies of cosmological objects should take into account their positions\nwithin the cosmic web of large-scale structure. Unfortunately, the cosmic web\nhas only been extensively mapped at low-redshifts ($z<1$), using galaxy\nredshifts as tracers of the underlying density field. At $z>1$, the required\ngalaxy densities are inaccessible for the foreseeable future, but 3D\nreconstructions of Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest absorption in closely-separated\nbackground QSOs and star-forming galaxies already offer a detailed window into\n$z\\sim2-3$ large-scale structure. We quantify the utility of such maps for\nstudying the cosmic web by using realistic $z=2.5$ Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nsimulations matched to observational properties of upcoming surveys. A\ndeformation tensor-based analysis is used to classify voids, sheets, filaments\nand nodes in the flux, which is compared to those determined from the\nunderlying dark matter field. We find an extremely good correspondence, with\n$70\\%$ of the volume in the flux maps correctly classified relative to the dark\nmatter web, and $99\\%$ classified to within 1 eigenvalue. This compares\nfavorably to the performance of galaxy-based classifiers with even the highest\ngalaxy densities at low-redshift. We find that narrow survey geometries can\ndegrade the cosmic web recovery unless the survey is $\\gtrsim\n60\\,h^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ or $\\gtrsim 1\\,\\mathrm{deg}$ on the sky. We also\nexamine halo abundances as a function of the cosmic web, and find a clear\ndependence as a function of flux overdensity, but little explicit dependence on\nthe cosmic web. These methods will provide a new window on cosmological\nenvironments of galaxies at this very special time in galaxy formation, \"high\nnoon\", and on overall properties of cosmological structures at this epoch.\n", "  Microswimmers, especially in theoretical treatments, are generally taken to\nbe completely inertia-free, since inertial effects on their motion are\ntypically small and assuming their absence simplifies the problem considerably.\nYet in nature there is no discrete break between swimmers for which inertia is\nnegligibly small and for which it is detectable. Here we study a microswimming\nmodel for which the effect of inertia is calculated explicitly in the regime of\ntransition between the Stokesian and the non-Stokesian flow limits, which we\nterm the intermediate regime. The model in the inertialess limit is the\nbead-spring swimmer. We first show that in the intermediate regime a mechanical\nmicroswimmer exhibits damped inertial coasting like an underdamped harmonic\noscillator. We then calculate analytically the swimmer's velocity by including\na mass-acceleration term in the equations of motion which are otherwise based\non the Stokes flow. We show that this hybrid treatment combining aspects of\nunderdamped and overdamped dynamics provides an accurate description of the\nmotion in the intermediate regime, as verified here by comparison to\nsimulations using the lattice Boltzmann method, and is a significant\nimprovement over the results from the inertialess theory when either the mass\nof the swimmer or the forces driving its motion is/are large enough.\n", "  We report the transverse energy ($E_{\\mathrm T}$) measured with ALICE at\nmidrapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV as a\nfunction of centrality. The transverse energy was measured using identified\nsingle particle tracks. The measurement was cross checked using the\nelectromagnetic calorimeters and the transverse momentum distributions of\nidentified particles previously reported by ALICE. The results are compared to\ntheoretical models as well as to results from other experiments. The mean\n$E_{\\mathrm T}$ per unit pseudorapidity ($\\eta$), $\\langle $d$E_{\\mathrm\nT}/$d$\\eta \\rangle$, in 0-5% central collisions is 1737 $\\pm$ 6(stat.) $\\pm$\n97(sys.) GeV. We find a similar centrality dependence of the shape of $\\langle\n$d$E_{\\mathrm T}/$d$\\eta \\rangle$ as a function of the number of participating\nnucleons to that seen at lower energies. The growth in $\\langle $d$E_{\\mathrm\nT}/$d$\\eta \\rangle$ at the LHC ${\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}$ exceeds\nextrapolations of low energy data. We observe a nearly linear scaling of\n$\\langle $d$E_{\\mathrm T}/$d$\\eta \\rangle$ with the number of quark\nparticipants. With the canonical assumption of a 1 fm/$c$ formation time, we\nestimate that the energy density in 0-5% central Pb-Pb collisions at\n${\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV is 12.3 $\\pm$ 1.0 GeV/fm$^3$\\xspace and\nthat the energy density at the most central 80 fm$^2$ of the collision is at\nleast 21.5 $\\pm$ 1.7 GeV/fm$^3$. This is roughly 2.3 times that observed in\n0-5% central Au-Au collisions at ${\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm {NN}}}}$ = 200 GeV.\n", "  The Beyond Horndeski class of alternative gravity theories allow for\nSelf-accelerating de-Sitter cosmologies with no need for a cosmological\nconstant. This makes them viable alternatives to $\\Lambda$CDM and so testing\ntheir small-scale predictions against General Relativity is of paramount\nimportance. These theories generically predict deviations in both the Newtonian\nforce law and the gravitational lensing of light inside extended objects.\nTherefore, by simultaneously fitting the X-ray and lensing profiles of galaxy\nclusters new constraints can be obtained. In this work, we apply this\nmethodology to the stacked profiles of 58 high-redshift ($ 0.1<z<1.2$) clusters\nusing X-ray surface brightness profiles from the XMM Cluster Survey and weak\nlensing profiles from CFHTLenS. By performing a multi-parameter Markov chain\nMonte Carlo analysis, we are able to place new constraints on the parameters\ngoverning deviations from Newton's law $\\Upsilon_{1}=-0.11^{+0.93}_{-0.67}$ and\nlight bending $\\Upsilon_{2}=-0.22^{+1.22}_{-1.19}$. Both constraints are\nconsistent with General Relativity, for which $\\Upsilon_{1}=\\Upsilon_{2}=0$. We\npresent here the first observational constraints on $\\Upsilon_{2}$, as well as\nthe first extragalactic measurement of both parameters.\n", "  We study the mechanical actions affecting close scatterers immersed in a\ncoherent fermionic fluid. Using a scattering field theory, we theoretically\nanalyse the single-scatterer and the two-scatterer case. Concerning the\nsingle-scatterer case, we find that a net force affects the scatterer dynamics\nonly in non-equilibrium condition, i.e. imposing the presence of a\nnon-vanishing particle current flowing through the system. The force\nfluctuation (variance) is instead not negligible both in equilibrium and in\nnon-equilibrium conditions. Concerning the two-scatterer case, an attractive\nfluid-mediated Casimir force is experienced by the scatterers at small spatial\nseparation, while a decaying attractive/repulsive behavior as a function of the\nscatterer separation is found. Furthermore, the Casimir force fluctuations\nacting on a given scatterer in close vicinity of the other present an\noscillating behavior reaching a long distance limit comparable to the value of\nthe single-scatterer case. The relevance of these findings is discussed in\nconnection with fluctuation phenomena in low-dimensional nanostructures and\ncold atoms systems.\n", "  In this paper we estimate the flux of PeV neutrinos and gamma-rays from\nmagnetar polar caps, assuming that ions/protons are injected, and accelerated\nin these regions and interact with the radiative background. The present study\ntakes into account the effect of the photon splitting mechanisms that should\nmodify the radiative background, and enhance the neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes\nat PeV energies, with a view to explain the PeV neutrino events detected in\nIceCube. The results indicate that in near future, possibility of any\nsignificant excess of neutrino events from a magnetar in Milky Way is extremely\nlow. Further, we suggest that the simultaneous observation of neutrinos and\ngamma-rays at Earth from expanded 'Gen2' IceCube detector and/or High Altitude\nWater Cherenkov Observatory would provide opportunities to explore the possible\norigin of very high energy neutrinos and gamma-rays.\n", "  The intention of this manuscript is twofold. First, the mode-width\nprobability density function (PDF) is introduced as a powerful statistical tool\nto study and compare the transverse Anderson localization properties of a\ndisordered one dimensional optical waveguide. Second, by analyzing the scaling\nproperties of the mode-width PDF with the transverse size of the waveguide, it\nis shown that the mode-width PDF gradually converges to a terminal\nconfiguration. Therefore, it may not be necessary to study a real-sized\ndisordered structure in order to obtain its statistical localization properties\nand the same PDF can be obtained for a substantially smaller structure. This\nobservation is important because it can reduce the often demanding\ncomputational effort that is required to study the statistical properties of\nAnderson localization in disordered waveguides. Using the mode-width PDF,\nsubstantial information about the impact of the waveguide parameters on its\nlocalization properties is extracted. This information is generally obscured\nwhen disordered waveguides are analyzed using other techniques such as the beam\npropagation method. As an example of the utility of the mode-width PDF, it is\nshown that the cladding refractive index can be used to quench the number of\nextended modes, hence improving the contrast in image transport properties of\ndisordered waveguides.\n", "  The flow properties at the leading edge of a flat plate represent a\nsingularity to the Blasius laminar boundary layer equations; by applying the\nLagrangian approach the leading edge velocity profiles of the laminar boundary\nlayer over a flat plate are studied. Experimental observations as well as the\ntheoretical analysis show an exact Gaussian distribution curve as the original\nstarting profile of the laminar flow. Comparisons between the Blasius solution\nand the Gaussian curve solution are carried out providing a new insight into\nthe physics of the laminar flow.\n", "  The description of interacting quantum impurity models in steady-state\nnonequilibrium is an open challenge for computational many-particle methods:\nthe numerical requirement of using a finite number of lead levels and the\nphysical requirement of describing a truly open quantum system are seemingly\nincompatible. One possibility to bridge this gap is the use of Lindblad-driven\ndiscretized leads (LDDL): one couples auxiliary continuous reservoirs to the\ndiscretized lead levels and represents these additional reservoirs by Lindblad\nterms in the Liouville equation. For quadratic models governed by Lindbladian\ndynamics, we present an elementary approach for obtaining correlation functions\nanalytically. In a second part, we use this approach to explicitly discuss the\nconditions under which the continuum limit of the LDDL approach recovers the\ncorrect representation of thermal reservoirs. As an analytically solvable\nexample, the nonequilibrium resonant level model is studied in greater detail.\nLastly, we present ideas towards a numerical evaluation of the suggested\nLindblad equation for interacting impurities based on matrix product states. In\nparticular, we present a reformulation of the Lindblad equation, which has the\nuseful property that the leads can be mapped onto a chain where both the\nHamiltonian dynamics and the Lindblad driving are local at the same time.\nMoreover, we discuss the possibility to combine the Lindblad approach with a\nlogarithmic discretization needed for the exploration of exponentially small\nenergy scales.\n", "  We study the quantum Kagom\\'e ice hardcore bosons, which corresponds to the\nXY limit of quantum spin ice Hamiltonian. We estimate the values of the\nzero-temperature thermodynamic quantities using the large-$S$ expansion. We\nshow that our semi-classical analysis is consistent with finite temperature\nquantum Monte Carlo estimates.\n", "  I will explain my joint paper `Instantons moduli spaces and W-algebras' with\nA.Braverman, M.Finkelberg, arXiv:1406.2381. I will concentrate on the geometric\npart, that is a study of perverse sheaves on instanton moduli spaces. I place a\nparticular emphasize on the hyperbolic restriction functor and stable envelop,\nwhich are our key tools, and appear also in other situations in geometric\nrepresentation theory.\n  These are lecture notes for a course in 2015 PCMI.\n", "  Observational evidence for the existence of Dark Matter is limited to its\ngravitational effects. The extensive program for dedicated searches has yielded\nnull results so far, challenging the most popular models. Here we propose that\nthis is the case because the very existence of cold Dark Matter is a\nmanifestation of gravity itself. The consistent bimetric theory of gravity, the\nonly known ghost-free extension of General Relativity involving a massless and\na massive spin-2 field, automatically contains a perfect Dark Matter candidate.\nWe demonstrate that the massive spin-2 particle can be heavy, stable on\ncosmological scales, and that it interacts with matter only through a\ngravitational type of coupling. Remarkably, these features persist in the same\nregion of parameter space where bimetric theory satisfies the current gravity\ntests. We show that the observed Dark Matter abundance can be generated via\nfreeze-in and suggest possible particle physics and gravitational signatures of\nour bimetric Dark Matter model.\n", "  Future CMB experiments have the potential to probe the density of\nrelativistic species at the sub-percent level. Sensitivity at this level allows\nlight thermal relics to be detected up to arbitrarily high decoupling\ntemperatures. Conversely, the absence of a detection would require extra light\nspecies never to have been in equilibrium with the Standard Model. In this\npaper, we exploit this feature to demonstrate the sensitivity of future\ncosmological observations to the couplings of axions to all of the Standard\nModel degrees of freedom. In many cases, the constraints achievable from\ncosmology will surpass existing bounds from laboratory experiments and\nastrophysical observations by orders of magnitude.\n", "  Quantum information theory is built upon the realisation that quantum\nresources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or\nenhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum\ncryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is\npotentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information\nprocessing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations,\nstemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced\nby a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible\nlocal bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all\nquantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain\nquantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence\nrepresents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of\nquantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic\ndomain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper\nunderstanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and\nquantum correlations in composite states. We focus on various approaches to\ndefine and quantify general quantum correlations, based on different yet\ninterlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance\nof the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information\nencoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader\noutlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks\nfit to play a key role.\n", "  We consider critical quantum transport in disordered topological quantum\nwires at the transition between phases with different topological indexes.\nFocusing on the example of thermal transport in class D (`Majorana') quantum\nwires, we identify a transport universality class distinguished for anomalous\nretardation in the propagation of excitations -- a quantum generalization of\nSinai diffusion. We discuss the expected manifestations of this transport\nmechanism for heat propagation in topological superconductors near criticality\nand provide a microscopic theory explaining the phenomenon.\n", "  We present up-to-date matched predictions for the $b\\bar{b}H$ inclusive cross\nsection at the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Using a previously developed method,\nour predictions consistently combine the complete NLO contributions that are\npresent in the 4-flavor scheme calculation, including finite b-quark mass\neffects as well as top-loop induced $Y_b Y_t$ interference contributions, with\nthe resummation of collinear logarithms of $m_b/m_H$ as present in the 5-flavor\nscheme calculation up to NNLO. We provide a detailed estimate of the\nperturbative uncertainties of the matched result by examining its dependence on\nthe factorization and renormalization scales, the scale of the Yukawa coupling,\nand also the low b-quark matching scale in the PDFs. We motivate the use of a\ncentral renormalization scale of $m_H$/2, which is halfway between the values\ntypically chosen in the 4-flavor and 5-flavor scheme calculations. We evaluate\nthe parametric uncertainties due to the PDFs and the b-quark mass, and in\nparticular discuss how to systematically disentangle the parametric $m_b$\ndependence and the unphysical b-quark matching scale dependence. Our best\nprediction for the $b\\bar{b} H$ production cross section in the Standard Model\nat 13 TeV and for $m_H$ = 125 GeV is $\\sigma(b\\bar b H) = 0.52 \\,{\\rm pb}\\, [1\n\\pm 9.6\\% {\\rm (perturbative)}\\,{}^{+2.9\\%}_{-3.6\\%} {\\rm (parametric)}]$. We\nalso provide predictions for a range of Higgs masses $m_H\\in [50, 750]$ GeV.\nOur method to compute the matched prediction and to evaluate its uncertainty\ncan be readily applied to other heavy-quark-initiated processes at the LHC.\n", "  We present measurements of the elliptic ($\\mathrm{v}_2$), triangular\n($\\mathrm{v}_3$) and quadrangular ($\\mathrm{v}_4$) anisotropic azimuthal flow\nover a wide range of pseudorapidities ($-3.5< \\eta < 5$). The measurements are\nperformed with Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\text{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV using the\nALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The flow harmonics are\nobtained using two- and four-particle correlations from nine different\ncentrality intervals covering central to peripheral collisions. We find that\nthe shape of $\\mathrm{v}_n(\\eta)$ is largely independent of centrality for the\nflow harmonics $n=2-4$, however the higher harmonics fall off more steeply with\nincreasing $|\\eta|$. We assess the validity of extended longitudinal scaling of\n$\\mathrm{v}_2$ by comparing to lower energy measurements, and find that the\nhigher harmonic flow coefficients are proportional to the charged particle\ndensities at larger pseudorapidities. Finally, we compare our measurements to\nboth hydrodynamical and transport models, and find they both have challenges\nwhen it comes to describing our data.\n", "  Recent discoveries regarding current-induced spin-orbit torques produced by\nheavy-metal/ferromagnet and topological-insulator/ferromagnet bilayers provide\nthe potential for dramatically-improved efficiency in the manipulation of\nmagnetic devices. However, in experiments performed to date, spin-orbit torques\nhave an important limitation -- the component of torque that can compensate\nmagnetic damping is required by symmetry to lie within the device plane. This\nmeans that spin-orbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of\nmagnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with\nin-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nthat are needed for high-density applications. Here we show experimentally that\nthis state of affairs is not fundamental, but rather one can change the allowed\nsymmetries of spin-orbit torques in spin-source/ferromagnet bilayer devices by\nusing a spin source material with low crystalline symmetry. We use WTe2, a\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide whose surface crystal structure has only one\nmirror plane and no two-fold rotational invariance. Consistent with these\nsymmetries, we generate an out-of-plane antidamping torque when current is\napplied along a low-symmetry axis of WTe2/Permalloy bilayers, but not when\ncurrent is applied along a high-symmetry axis. Controlling S-O torques by\ncrystal symmetries in multilayer samples provides a new strategy for optimizing\nfuture magnetic technologies.\n", "  The distribution of entanglement with Gaussian statistic can be used to\ngenerate a mathematically-proven secure key for quantum cryptography. The\ndistributed secret key rate is limited by the {entanglement strength, the\nentanglement bandwidth and the bandwidth of the photo-electric detectors}. The\ndevelopment of a source for strongly, bi-partite entangled light with high\nbandwidth promises an increased measurement speed and a linear boost in the\nsecure data rate. Here, we present the experimental realization of a Gaussian\nentanglement source with a bandwidth of more than 1.25\\,GHz. The entanglement\nspectrum was measured with balanced homodyne detectors and was quantified via\nthe inseparability criterion introduced by Duan and coworkers with a critical\nvalue of 4 below which entanglement is certified. Our measurements yielded an\ninseparability value of about 1.8 at a frequency of 300\\,MHz to about 2.8 at\n1.2\\,GHz extending further to about 3.1 at 1.48\\,GHz. In the experiment we used\ntwo 2.6\\,mm long monolithic periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate\n(PPKTP) resonators to generate two squeezed fields at the telecommunication\nwavelength of 1550\\,nm. Our result proves the possibility of generating and\ndetecting strong continuous-variable entanglement with high speed.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density,\n$\\eta/s$, in hyperscaling violating geometry with lattice structure. We show\nthat the scaling relation with hyperscaling violation gives a strong constraint\nto the mass of graviton and usually leads to a power law of temperature,\n$\\eta/s\\sim T^\\kappa$. We find the exponent $\\kappa$ can be greater than two\nsuch that the new bound for viscosity raised in arXiv:1601.02757 is violated.\nOur above observation is testified by constructing specific solutions with UV\ncompletion in various holographic models. Finally, we compare the boundedness\nof $\\kappa$ with the behavior of entanglement entropy and conjecture a relation\nbetween them.\n", "  We perform a validation of estimates of the growth rate of structure,\ndescribed by the parameter combination $f\\sigma_8$, in modified gravity\ncosmologies. We consider an analysis pipeline based on the redshift-space\ndistortion modelling of the clustering wedges statistic of the galaxy\ncorrelation function and apply it to mock catalogues of $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ and\nthe normal branch of DGP cosmologies. We employ a halo occupation distribution\napproach to construct our mocks, which we ensure resemble the CMASS sample from\nBOSS in terms of the total galaxy number density and large scale amplitude of\nthe power spectrum monopole. We show that the clustering wedges model\nsuccessfully recovers the true growth rate difference between DGP and\n$\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$, even for cases with over 40\\% enhancement in $f\\sigma_8$\ncompared to $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$. The unbiased performance of the clustering\nwedges model allows us to use the growth rate values estimated from the BOSS\nDR12 data to constrain the cross-over scale $r_c$ of DGP gravity to\n$\\left[r_cH_0\\right]^{-1} < 0.97$ ($2\\sigma$) or $r_c > 3090\\ {\\rm Mpc}/h$,\ncutting into the interesting region of parameter space with $r_c \\sim H_0^{-1}$\nusing constraints from the growth of structure alone.\n", "  Mechanical angular momentum is not conserved in systems involving\nelectromagnetic fields with non-zero electromagnetic field angular momentum.\nConservation is restored only if the total (mechanical and field) angular\nmomentum is considered. Previous studies have investigated this effect, known\nas \"Feynman's Electromagnetic Paradox\" or simply \"Disk Paradox\" in the context\nof idealized systems (infinite or infinitesimal solenoids and charged cylinders\netc). In the present analysis we generalize previous studies by considering\nmore realistic systems with finite components and demonstrating explicitly the\nconservation of the total angular momentum. This is achieved by expressing both\nthe mechanical and the field angular momentum in terms of charges and magnetic\nfield fluxes through various system components. Using this general expression\nand the closure of magnetic field lines, we demonstrate explicitly the\nconservation of total angular momentum in both idealized and realistic systems\n(finite solenoid concentric with two charged cylinders, much longer than the\nsolenoid) taking all the relevant terms into account including the flux outside\nof the solenoid. This formalism has the potential to facilitate a simpler and\nmore accurate demonstration of total angular momentum conservation in\nundergraduate physics electromagnetism laboratories.\n", "  The extraction of the magnetic form factor of the nucleon at zero momentum\ntransfer is usually performed by adopting a parametrization for its momentum\ndependence and fitting the results obtained at finite momenta. We present a\nposition space method that allows us to remove the momentum prefactor in the\nform factor decomposition and hence compute the magnetic form factor directly\nat zero momentum without the need to assume a functional form for its momentum\ndependence. The method is explored on one ensemble using $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson\ntwisted mass fermions with a light quark mass corresponding to\n$M_\\pi\\approx373\\mathrm{GeV}$ and a lattice spacing of\n$a\\approx0.082\\mathrm{fm}$. We obtain results for the isovector magnetic moment\nand for the proton and neutron magnetic moments. The value we find for the\nisovector magnetic moment is larger as compared to fitting the form factor at\nthe discrete values of the lattice momentum transfers using a dipole Ansatz,\nbringing it closer to the experimental value.\n", "  One important problem in plasma physics is the lack of an accurate and\ncomplete description of Coulomb collisions in associated fluid models. To shed\nlight on the problem, this Letter introduces an integral identity involving the\nmulti-dimensional Hermite tensor polynomials and presents a method for\ncomputing exact expressions for the fluid moments of the nonlinear Landau\ncollision operator. The proposed methodology provides a systematic and rigorous\nmeans of extending the validity of fluid models that have an underlying\ninverse-square force particle dynamics to weakly collisional and strong flow\nregimes.\n", "  We select from Paper I a sample of 306 massive star clusters observed with\nthe Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) in the\nvicinity fields of M31 and M33 and determine their metallicities, ages and\nmasses. Metallicities and ages are estimated by fitting the observed integrated\nspectra with stellar synthesis population (SSP) models with a pixel-to-pixel\nspectral fitting technique. Ages for most young clusters are also derived by\nfitting the multi-band photometric measurements with model spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs). The estimated cluster ages span a wide range, from\nseveral million years to the age of the universe. The numbers of clusters\nyounger and older than 1 Gyr are respectively 46 and 260. With ages and\nmetallicities determined, cluster masses are then estimated by comparing the\nmulti-band photometric measurements with SSP model SEDs. The derived masses\nrange from $\\sim 10^{3}$ to $\\sim 10^7$ $M_{\\odot}$, peaking at $\\sim 10^{4.3}$\nand $\\sim 10^{5.7}$ $M_{\\odot}$ for young ($< 1$ Gyr) and old ($>1$ Gyr)\nclusters, respectively. Our estimated metallicities, ages and masses are in\ngood agreement with available literature values. Old clusters richer than\n[Fe/H] $\\sim -0.7$ dex have a wide range of ages. Those poorer than [Fe/H]\n$\\sim -0.7$ dex seem to be composed of two groups, as previously found for\nGalactic GCs -- one of the oldest ages with all values of metallicity down to\n$\\sim -2$ dex and another with metallicity increasing with decreasing age. The\nold clusters in the inner disk of M\\,31 (0 -- 30 kpc) show a clear metallicity\ngradient measured at $-0.038\\pm0.023$ dex/kpc.\n", "  A simple phenomenological account for planetary climate instabilities is\npresented. The description is based on the standard model where the balance of\nincoming stellar radiation and outward thermal radiation is described by the\neffective planet temperature. Often, it is found to have three different\npoints, or temperatures, where the influx of radiation is balanced with the\nout-flux, even with conserved boundary conditions. Two of these points are\nrelatively long-term stable, namely the point corresponding to a frozen-climate\nand the point corresponding to a hot-climate. The hypothesis promoted in this\npaper is the possibility that it is the intermediate third point which is the\nbasis for habitable-climates. I.e. that this initially unstable point is made\nrelatively stable over a long period by the presence of seasonal climate\nvariations. This points to the axial inclination, and perhaps the presence of\norbital eccentricity, as the origin of the stability of the habitable point. An\nanalysis involving the inclination, the size of the ice caps, and the length of\nthe year shows that within the currently accepted value of the heat capacity of\nthe Earth, the otherwise unstable habitable point is stabilized.\n", "  We report on the discovery and characterization of the transiting planet\nK2-39b (EPIC 206247743b). With an orbital period of 4.6 days, it is the\nshortest-period planet orbiting a subgiant star known to date. Such planets are\nrare, with only a handful of known cases. The reason for this is poorly\nunderstood, but may reflect differences in planet occurrence around the\nrelatively high-mass stars that have been surveyed, or may be the result of\ntidal destruction of such planets. K2-39 is an evolved star with a\nspectroscopically derived stellar radius and mass of\n$3.88^{+0.48}_{-0.42}~\\mathrm{R_\\odot}$ and\n$1.53^{+0.13}_{-0.12}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, respectively, and a very close-in\ntransiting planet, with $a/R_\\star = 3.4$. Radial velocity (RV) follow-up using\nthe HARPS, FIES and PFS instruments leads to a planetary mass of\n$50.3^{+9.7}_{-9.4}~\\mathrm{M_\\oplus}$. In combination with a radius\nmeasurement of $8.3 \\pm 1.1~\\mathrm{R_\\oplus}$, this results in a mean\nplanetary density of $0.50^{+0.29}_{-0.17}$ g~cm$^{-3}$. We furthermore\ndiscover a long-term RV trend, which may be caused by a long-period planet or\nstellar companion. Because K2-39b has a short orbital period, its existence\nmakes it seem unlikely that tidal destruction is wholly responsible for the\ndifferences in planet populations around subgiant and main-sequence stars.\nFuture monitoring of the transits of this system may enable the detection of\nperiod decay and constrain the tidal dissipation rates of subgiant stars.\n", "  We investigate the coherent and incoherent nonparaxial Weber beams,\ntheoretically and numerically. We show that the superposition of coherent\nself-accelerating Weber beams with transverse displacement cannot display the\nnonparaxial accelerating Talbot effect. The reason is that their lobes do not\naccelerate in unison, which is a requirement for the appearance of the effect.\nWhile for the incoherent Weber beams, they naturally cannot display the\naccelerating Talbot effect but can display the nonparaxial accelerating\nproperties, although the transverse coherence length is smaller than the beam\nwidth, based on the second-order coherence theory. Our research method directly\napplies to the nonparaxial Mathieu beams as well, and one will obtain similar\nconclusions as for the Weber beams, although this is not discussed in the\npaper. Our investigation identifies families of nonparaxial accelerating beams\nthat do not exhibit the accelerating Talbot effect, and in addition broadens\nthe understanding of coherence properties of such nonparaxial accelerating\nbeams.\n", "  The intriguing many-body phases of quantum matter arise from the interplay of\nparticle interactions, spatial symmetries, and external fields. Generating\nthese phases in an engineered system could provide deeper insight into their\nnature and the potential for harnessing their unique properties. However,\nconcurrently bringing together the main ingredients for realizing many-body\nphenomena in a single experimental platform is a major challenge. Using\nsuperconducting qubits, we simultaneously realize synthetic magnetic fields and\nstrong particle interactions, which are among the essential elements for\nstudying quantum magnetism and fractional quantum Hall (FQH) phenomena. The\nartificial magnetic fields are synthesized by sinusoidally modulating the qubit\ncouplings. In a closed loop formed by the three qubits, we observe the\ndirectional circulation of photons, a signature of broken time-reversal\nsymmetry. We demonstrate strong interactions via the creation of\nphoton-vacancies, or \"holes\", which circulate in the opposite direction. The\ncombination of these key elements results in chiral groundstate currents, the\nfirst direct measurement of persistent currents in low-lying eigenstates of\nstrongly interacting bosons. The observation of chiral currents at such a small\nscale is interesting and suggests that the rich many-body physics could survive\nto smaller scales. We also motivate the feasibility of creating FQH states with\nnear future superconducting technologies. Our work introduces an experimental\nplatform for engineering quantum phases of strongly interacting photons and\nhighlight a path toward realization of bosonic FQH states.\n", "  Electron transport through a nanoscale system is an inherently stochastic\nquantum mechanical process. Electric current is a time series of electron\ntunnelling events separated by random intervals. Thermal and quantum noise are\ntwo sources of this randomness. In this paper, we used the quantum master\nequation to consider the following questions: (i) Given that an electron has\ntunnelled into the electronically unoccupied system from the source electrode\nat some particular time, how long is it until an electron tunnels out to the\ndrain electrode to leave the system electronically unoccupied, where there were\nno intermediate tunnelling events (\"the\" tunnelling path)? (ii) Given that an\nelectron has tunnelled into the unoccupied system from the source electrode at\nsome particular time, how long is it until an electron tunnels out to the drain\nelectrode to leave the system electronically unoccupied, where there were no\nintermediate tunnelling events (\"an\" tunnelling path)? (iii) What are the\ndistributions of these times? We show that electron correlations suppress the\ndifference between \"the\" and \"an\" electron tunnelling paths.\n", "  We consider observational limits on a proposed model of the string landscape\nin inflation. In this scenario, effects from the decoherence of entangled\nquantum states in long-wavelength modes in the universe result in modifications\nto the Friedmann Equation and a corresponding modification to inflationary\ndynamics. Previous work by Holman, Mersini-Houghton, and Takahashi suggested\nthat such effects could provide an explanation for well-known anomalies in the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB), such as the lack of power on large scales\nand the \"cold spot\" seen by both the WMAP and Planck satellites. In this paper,\nwe compute limits on these entanglement effects from the Planck CMB data\ncombined with the BICEP/Keck polarization measurement, and find no evidence for\nobservable modulations to the power spectrum from landscape entanglement, and\nno sourcing of observable CMB anomalies. The originally proposed model with an\nexponential potential is ruled out to high significance. Assuming a\nStarobinsky-type $R^2$ inflation model, which is consistent with CMB\nconstraints, data place a $2\\sigma$ lower bound of $b > 6.46 \\times 10^7\\ {\\rm\nGeV}$ on the Supersymmetry breaking scale associated with entanglement\ncorrections.\n", "  Biofilms are complex, self-organized consortia of microorganisms that produce\na functional, protective matrix of biomolecules. Physically, the structure of a\nbiofilm can be described as an entangled polymer network which grows and\nchanges under the effect of gradients of nutrients, cell differentiation,\nquorum sensing, bacterial motion, and interaction with the environment. Its\ndevelopment is complex, and constantly adapting to environmental stimuli. Here,\nwe review the fundamental physical processes the govern the inception, growth\nand development of a biofilm. Two important mechanisms guide the initial phase\nin a biofilm life cycle: (\\emph{i}) the cell motility near or at a solid\ninterface, and (\\emph{ii}) the cellular adhesion. Both processes are crucial\nfor initiating the colony and for ensuring its stability. A mature biofilm\nbehaves as a viscoelastic fluid with a complex, history-dependent dynamics. We\ndiscuss progress and challenges in the determination of its physical\nproperties. Experimental and theoretical methods are now available that aim at\nintegrating the biofilm's hierarchy of interactions, and the heterogeneity of\ncomposition and spatial structures. We also discuss important directions in\nwhich future work should be directed.\n", "  We propose approximations for force-extension dependencies for the freely\njointed chain (FJC) and worm-like chain (WLC) models as well as for\nextension-force dependence for the WLC model. Proposed expressions show less\nthan 1% relative error in the useful range of the corresponding variables.\nThese results can be applied for fitting force-extension curves obtained in\nmolecular force spectroscopy experiments. Particularly they can be useful for\ncases where one has geometries of springs in series and/or in parallel where\nparticular combination of expressions should be used for fitting the data. All\napproximations have been obtained following the same procedure of determining\nthe asymptotes and then reducing the relative error of that expression by\nadding an appropriate term obtained from fitting its absolute error.\n", "  Identifying the most influential spreaders that maximize information flow is\na central question in network theory. Recently, a scalable method called\n\"Collective Influence (CI)\" has been put forward through collective influence\nmaximization. In contrast to heuristic methods evaluating nodes' significance\nseparately, CI method inspects the collective influence of multiple spreaders.\nDespite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation\nmodel, it is still important to examine its efficacy in realistic information\nspreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and\nscientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and\nLiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal\nmulti-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted\nfrom data to construct \"virtual\" information spreading processes. Our results\ndemonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of\ninformation propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections\nor citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance\nin realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings\nscientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number\nof citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in\nthe community.\n", "  We consider the Einstein-Dirac field equations describing a self-gravitating\nmassive neutrino, looking for axially-symmetric exact solutions; in the search\nof general solutions, we find some that are specific and which have critical\nfeatures, such as the fact that the space-time curvature turns out to be flat\nand the spinor field gives rise to a vanishing bi-linear scalar\n$\\overline{\\psi}\\psi=0$ with non-vanishing bi-linear pseudo-scalar\n$i\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma^5\\psi\\not=0$: because in quantum field theory general\ncomputational methods are built on plane-wave solutions, for which bi-linear\npseudo-scalar vanishes while the bi-linear scalar does not vanish, then the\nsolutions we found cannot be treated with the usual machinery of quantum field\ntheory. This means that for the Einstein-Dirac system there exist admissible\nsolutions which nevertheless cannot be quantized with the common prescriptions;\nwe regard this situation as yet another issue of tension between Einstein\ngravity and quantum principles. Possible ways to quench this tension can be\nseen either in enlarging the validity of quantum field theory or by restricting\nthe space of the solutions of the Einstein-Dirac system of field equations.\n", "  We use recent developments in the framework of time dependent matrix product\nstate method (t-MPS) to compute the NMR relaxation rate $1/T_1$ for spin-1/2\nchains under magnetic field and for different Hamiltonians (XXX, XXZ,\nisotropically dimerized). We compute numerically the temperature dependence of\nthe $1/T_1$. We consider both gapped and gapless phases, and also the proximity\nof quantum critical points. At temperatures much lower than the typical\nexchange energy scale our results are in excellent agreement with analytical\nresults, such as the ones derived from the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL)\ntheory and bosonization which are valid in this regime. We also cover the\nregime for which the temperature $T$ is comparable to the exchange coupling. In\nthis case analytical theories are not appropriate but this regime is relevant\nfor various new compounds with exchange couplings in the range of tens of\nKelvin. For the gapped phases, either the fully polarized phase for spins\nchains or the low magnetic field phase for the dimerized systems, we find an\nexponential decrease in $\\Delta/(k_BT)$ of the relaxation time and can compute\nthe gap $\\Delta$. Close to the quantum critical point our results are in good\nagreement with the a scaling behavior based on the existence of free\nexcitations.\n", "  We have studied the shadow of a regular phantom black hole as photons couple\nto Weyl tensor. We find that the coupling yields that photons with different\npolarization directions propagate along different paths in the spacetime so\nthat there exits double shadow for a black hole, which is quite different from\nthat in the non-coupling case where only a single shadow emerges. The umbra of\nblack hole increases with the phantom charge and decreases with the coupling\nstrength. The dependence of the penumbra on the phantom charge and the coupling\nstrength is converse to that of the umbra. Combining with the supermassive\ncentral object in our Galaxy, we estimated the shadow of the black hole as the\nphotons couple to Weyl tensor. Our results show that the coupling brings richer\nbehaviors of the propagation of coupled photon and the shadow of the black hole\nin the regular phantom black hole spacetime.\n", "  The characteristics of an acoustic scatterer are often described by\nscattering coefficients. The understanding of the mechanisms involved in the\nfrequency dependent features of the coefficients has been a challenge task,\nowing to the complicated coupling between the waves in open space and the modes\ninside the finite scatterer. In this paper, a frequency-dependent modal\ndescription of the scattering coefficient is utilized to study the modal\nproperties of the scatterer. The important role that eigenmodes play in\ndefining the features of the scattering coefficients is revealed via an\nexpansion of the coefficients by the eigenmodes. The results show the local\nextrema of the scattering coefficients can be attributed to the\nconstructive/destructive interference of resonant and non-resonant modes. In\nparticular, an approximated equation, which is equivalent to the standard Fano\nformula, is obtained to describe the sharp anti-symmetric Fano characteristics\nof the scattering coefficients. The special cases where scattering is dominated\nby a single resonance eigenmode, corresponding to the \"resonance transmission\",\nare also illustrated.\n", "  We introduce a scheme to reconstruct an arbitrary quantum state of a\nmechanical oscillator network. We assume that a single element of the network\nis coupled to a cavity field via a linearized optomechanical interaction, whose\ntime dependence is controlled by a classical driving field. By designing a\nsuitable interaction profile, we show how the statistics of an arbitrary\nmechanical quadrature can be encoded in the cavity field, which can then be\nmeasured. We discuss the important special case of Gaussian state\nreconstruction, and study numerically the effectiveness of our scheme for a\nfinite number of measurements. Finally, we speculate on possible routes to\nextend our ideas to the regime of single-photon optomechanics.\n", "  The redshift factor $z$ is an invariant quantity of fundamental interest in\npost-Newtonian and self-force descriptions of compact binaries. It connects\ndifferent approximation schemes, and plays a central role in the first law of\nbinary black hole mechanics, which links local quantities to asymptotic\nmeasures of energy and angular momentum in these systems. Through this law, the\nredshift factor is conjectured to have a close relation to the surface gravity\nof the event horizons of black holes in circular orbits. We propose and\nimplement a novel method for extracting the redshift factor on apparent\nhorizons in numerical simulations of quasicircular binary inspirals. Our\nresults confirm the conjectured relationship between $z$ and the surface\ngravity of the holes and that the first law holds to a remarkable degree for\nbinary inspirals. The redshift factor enables tests of analytic predictions for\n$z$ in spacetimes where the binary is only approximately circular, giving a new\nconnection between analytic approximations and numerical simulations.\n", "  We introduce several new identities combining basic hypergeometric sums and\nintegrals. Such identities appear in the context of superconformal index\ncomputations for three-dimensional supersymmetric dual theories. We give both\nanalytic proofs and physical interpretations of the presented identities.\n", "  The ground state energy of a system of electrons and nuclei is proven to be a\nvariational functional of the conditional electronic density $n_R(\\mathbf{r})$,\nthe nuclear wavefunction $\\chi(R)$ and an induced vector potential $A_{\\mu}(R)$\nand quantum geometric tensor $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mu\\nu}(R)$ derived from the\nconditional electronic wavefunction $\\Phi_R(r)$ over nuclear configuration\nspace, where $r=\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2,\\ldots$ are electronic coordinates\nand $R=\\mathbf{R}_1,\\mathbf{R}_2,\\ldots$ are nuclear coordinates. The ground\nstate $(n_R,\\chi,A_{\\mu},\\mathcal{T}_{\\mu\\nu})$ can be calculated by solving\nself-consistently (i) conditional Kohn-Sham equations containing an effective\npotential $v_{\\rm s}(\\mathbf{r})$ that depends parametrically on $R$, (ii) the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation for $\\chi(R)$ and (iii) Euler-Lagrange equations that\ndetermine $\\mathcal{T}_{\\mu\\nu}$. The theory is applied to the $E\\otimes e$\nJahn-Teller model.\n", "  We present a conjugate-gradient method for the ground-state optimization of\nprojected entangled-pair states (PEPS) in the thermodynamic limit, as a direct\nimplementation of the variational principle within the PEPS manifold. Our\noptimization is based on an efficient and accurate evaluation of the gradient\nof the global energy functional by using effective corner environments, and is\nrobust with respect to the initial starting points. It has the additional\nadvantage that physical and virtual symmetries can be straightforwardly\nimplemented. We provide the tools to compute static structure factors directly\nin momentum space, as well as the variance of the Hamiltonian. We benchmark our\nmethod on Ising and Heisenberg models, and show a significant improvement on\nthe energies and order parameters as compared to algorithms based on\nimaginary-time evolution.\n", "  In a new classification of merging binary neutron stars (NSs) we separate\nshort gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in two sub-classes. The ones with\n$E_{iso}\\lesssim10^{52}$ erg coalesce to form a massive NS and are indicated as\nshort gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs). The hardest, with $E_{iso}\\gtrsim10^{52}$\nerg, coalesce to form a black hole (BH) and are indicated as genuine short-GRBs\n(S-GRBs). Within the fireshell model, S-GRBs exhibit three different\ncomponents: the P-GRB emission, observed at the transparency of a\nself-accelerating baryon-$e^+e^-$ plasma; the prompt emission, originating from\nthe interaction of the accelerated baryons with the circumburst medium; the\nhigh-energy (GeV) emission, observed after the P-GRB and indicating the\nformation of a BH. GRB 090510 gives the first evidence for the formation of a\nKerr BH or, possibly, a Kerr-Newman BH. Its P-GRB spectrum can be fitted by a\nconvolution of thermal spectra whose origin can be traced back to an axially\nsymmetric dyadotorus. A large value of the angular momentum of the newborn BH\nis consistent with the large energetics of this S-GRB, which reach in the\n1--10000 keV range $E_{iso}=(3.95\\pm0.21)\\times10^{52}$ erg and in the 0.1--100\nGeV range $E_{LAT}=(5.78\\pm0.60)\\times10^{52}$ erg, the most energetic GeV\nemission ever observed in S-GRBs. The theoretical redshift $z_{th}=0.75\\pm0.17$\nthat we derive from the fireshell theory is consistent with the spectroscopic\nmeasurement $z=0.903\\pm0.003$, showing the self-consistency of the theoretical\napproach. All S-GRBs exhibit GeV emission, when inside the Fermi-LAT field of\nview, unlike S-GRFs, which never evidence it. The GeV emission appears to be\nthe discriminant for the formation of a BH in GRBs, confirmed by their observed\noverall energetics.\n", "  We construct, analytically and numerically, the Wigner distribution functions\nfor the exact solutions of position-dependent effective mass Schr\\\"odinger\nequation for two cases belonging to the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Using\na suitable quantum canonical transformation, expectation values of position and\nmomentum operators can be obtained analytically in order to verify the\nuniversality of the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n", "  A transport study of two-dimensional (2D) holes confined to wide GaAs quantum\nwells provides a glimpse of a subtle competition between different many-body\nphases at Landau level filling $\\nu=3/2$ in tilted magnetic fields. At large\ntilt angles ($\\theta$), an anisotropic, stripe (or nematic) phase replaces the\nisotropic compressible Fermi sea at $\\nu=3/2$ if the quantum well has a\nsymmetric charge distribution. When the charge distribution is made asymmetric,\ninstead of the stripe phase, an even-denominator fractional quantum state\nappears at $\\nu=3/2$ in a range of large $\\theta$, and reverts back to a\ncompressible state at even higher $\\theta$. We attribute this remarkable\nevolution to the significant mixing of the excited and ground-state Landau\nlevels of 2D hole systems in tilted fields.\n", "  Recently, Ali and Khalil \\cite{Farag Ali}, based on the Bohmian quantum\nmechanics derived a quantum corrected version of the Schwarzschild metric. In\nthis paper, we construct a quantum corrected Schwarzschild thin shell wormhole\n(QSTSW) and investigate the stability of this wormhole. First we compute the\nsurface stress at the wormhole throat by applying the Darmois-Israel formalism\nto the modified Schwarzschild metric and show that exotic matter is required at\nthe throat to keep the wormhole stable. We then study the stability analysis of\nthe wormhole by considering phantom-energy for the exotic matter, generalized\nChaplygin gas (GCG), and the linearized stability analysis. It is argued that,\nquantum corrections can affect the stability domain of the wormhole.\n", "  We propose a novel approach to the brane worldvolume theory based on the\ngeometry of extended field theories: double field theory and exceptional field\ntheory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by showing that one\ncan reproduce the conventional bosonic string and membrane actions, and the\nM5-brane action in the weak-field approximation. At a glance, the proposed\n5-brane action without approximation looks different from the known M5-brane\nactions, but it is consistent with the known nonlinear self-duality relation,\nand it may provide a new formulation of a single M5-brane action. Actions for\nexotic branes are also discussed.\n", "  We present an explicit reexamination of Gisin's 1991 original proof\nconcerning the violation of Bell's inequality for any pure entangled state of\ntwo-particle systems. Given the relevance of Gisin's work, our analysis is\nmotivated by pedagogical reasons and allows the straightening of a few\nmathematical points in the original proof that in no way change the physical\nconclusions reached by Gisin.\n", "  We investigate phase and frequency estimation with different measurement\nstrategies under the effect of collective phase noise. First, we consider the\nstandard linear estimation scheme and present an experimentally realisable\noptimization of the initial probe states by collective rotations. We identify\nthe optimal rotation angle for different measurement times. Second, we show\nthat sub-shot noise sensitivity - up to the Heisenberg limit - can be reached\nin presence of collective phase noise by using differential interferometry,\nwhere one part of the system is used to monitor the noise. For this, not only\nGHZ states but also symmetric Dicke states are suitable. We investigate the\noptimal splitting for a general symmetric Dicke state at both inputs and\ndiscuss possible experimental realisations of differential interferometry.\n", "  We study random knots, which we define as a triple of random periodic\nfunctions (where a random function is a random trigonometric series,\n\\[f(\\theta) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k \\cos (k \\theta) +b_k (\\sin k \\theta),\\]\nwith $a_k, b_k$ are independent gaussian random variables with mean $0$ and\nvariance $\\sigma(k)^2$ - our results will depend on the functional dependence\nof $\\sigma$ on $k.$ In particular, we show that if $\\sigma(k) = k^\\alpha,$ with\n$\\alpha < -3/2,$ then the probability of getting a knot type which admits a\nprojection with $N$ crossings, decays at least as fast as $1/N.$ The constant\n$3/2$ is significant, because having $\\alpha < -3/2$ is exactly the condition\nfor $f(\\theta)$ to be a $C^1$ function, so our class is precisely the class of\nrandom \\emph{tame} knots. We also find some suprising experimental observations\non the zeros of Alexander polynomials of random knots (with slowly and\nnon-decaying coefficients), and even more surprising observations on their\ncoefficients. Our observations persist in other models of random knots, making\nit likely that the results are universal.\n", "  The exponential scale length ($L_d$) of the Milky Way's (MW's) disk is a\ncritical parameter for describing the global physical size of our Galaxy,\nimportant both for interpreting other Galactic measurements and helping us to\nunderstand how our Galaxy fits into extragalactic contexts. Unfortunately,\ncurrent estimates span a wide range of values and often are statistically\nincompatible with one another. Here, we perform a Bayesian meta-analysis to\ndetermine an improved, aggregate estimate for $L_d$, utilizing a mixture-model\napproach to account for the possibility that any one measurement has not\nproperly accounted for all statistical or systematic errors. Within this\nmachinery we explore a variety of ways of modeling the nature of problematic\nmeasurements, and then employ a Bayesian model averaging technique to derive\nnet posterior distributions that incorporate any model-selection uncertainty.\nOur meta-analysis combines 29 different (15 visible and 14 infrared)\nphotometric measurements of $L_d$ available in the literature; these involve a\nbroad assortment of observational datasets, MW models and assumptions, and\nmethodologies, all tabulated herein. Analyzing the visible and infrared\nmeasurements separately yields estimates for $L_d$ of $2.71^{+0.22}_{-0.20}$\nkpc and $2.51^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ kpc, respectively, whereas considering them all\ncombined yields $2.64\\pm0.13$ kpc. The ratio between the visible and infrared\nscale lengths determined here is very similar to that measured in external\nspiral galaxies. We use these results to update the model of the Galactic disk\nfrom our previous work, constraining its stellar mass to be\n$4.8^{+1.5}_{-1.1}\\times10^{10}$ $\\textrm{M}_\\odot$, and the MW's total stellar\nmass to be $5.7^{+1.5}_{-1.1}\\times10^{10}$ $\\textrm{M}_\\odot$.\n", "  Short-range experiments testing the gravitational inverse-square law at the\nsubmillimeter scale offer uniquely sensitive probes of Lorentz invariance. A\ncombined analysis of results from the short-range gravity experiments\nHUST-2015, HUST-2011, IU-2012, and IU-2002 permits the first independent\nmeasurements of the 14 nonrelativistic coefficients for Lorentz violation in\nthe pure-gravity sector at the level of $10^{-9}$ m$^2$, improving by an order\nof magnitude the sensitivity to numerous types of Lorentz violation involving\nquadratic curvature derivatives and curvature couplings.\n", "  We make a comparison for ten typical, popular dark energy models according to\ntheir capabilities of fitting the current observational data. The observational\ndata we use in this work include the JLA sample of type Ia supernovae\nobservation, the Planck 2015 distance priors of cosmic microwave background\nobservation, the baryon acoustic oscillations measurements, and the direct\nmeasurement of the Hubble constant. Since the models have different numbers of\nparameters, in order to make a fair comparison, we employ the Akaike and\nBayesian information criteria to assess the worth of the models. The analysis\nresults show that, according to the capability of explaining observations, the\ncosmological constant model is still the best one among all the dark energy\nmodels. The generalized Chaplygin gas model, the constant $w$ model, and the\n$\\alpha$ dark energy model are worse than the cosmological constant model, but\nstill are good models compared to others. The holographic dark energy model,\nthe new generalized Chaplygin gas model, and the Chevalliear-Polarski-Linder\nmodel can still fit the current observations well, but from an economically\nfeasible perspective, they are not so good. The new agegraphic dark energy\nmodel, the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, and the Ricci dark energy model are\nexcluded by the current observations.\n", "  We adapt the generalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method to an\ninteracting many-phonon system free of impurities. The many-phonon system is\nobtained from applying the Lee-Low-Pine (LLP) transformation to the Frohlich\nmodel which describes a mobile impurity coupled to noninteracting phonons. We\nspecialize our general HFB description of the Frohlich polaron to Bose polarons\nin quasi-1D cold atom mixtures. The LLP transformed many-phonon system\ndistinguishes itself with an artificial phonon-phonon interaction which is very\ndifferent from the usual two-body interaction. We use the quasi-one-dimensional\nmodel, which is free of an ultraviolet divergence that exists in higher\ndimensions, to better understand how this unique interaction affects polaron\nstates and how the density and pair correlations inherent to the HFB method\nconspire to create a polaron ground state with an energy in good agreement with\nand far closer to the prediction from Feynman's variational path integral\napproach than mean-field theory where HFB correlations are absent.\n", "  Previous experiments have shown that spherical colloidal particles relax to\nequilibrium slowly after they adsorb to a liquid-liquid interface, despite the\nlarge interfacial energy gradient driving the adsorption. The slow relaxation\nhas been explained in terms of transient pinning and depinning of the contact\nline on the surface of the particles. However, the nature of the pinning sites\nhas not been investigated in detail. We use digital holographic microscopy to\ntrack a variety of colloidal spheres---inorganic and organic, charge-stabilized\nand sterically stabilized, aqueous and non-aqueous---as they breach liquid\ninterfaces. We find that nearly all of these particles relax logarithmically in\ntime over timescales much larger than those expected from viscous dissipation\nalone. By comparing our results to theoretical models of the pinning dynamics,\nwe infer the area per defect to be on the order of a few square nanometers for\neach of the colloids we examine, whereas the energy per defect can vary from a\nfew $kT$ for non-aqueous and inorganic spheres to tens of $kT$ for aqueous\npolymer particles. The results suggest that the likely pinning sites are\ntopographical features inherent to colloidal particles---surface roughness in\nthe case of silica particles and grafted polymer \"hairs\" in the case of polymer\nparticles. We conclude that the slow relaxation must be taken into account in\nexperiments and applications, such as Pickering emulsions, that involve\ncolloids attaching to interfaces. The effect is particularly important for\naqueous polymer particles, which pin the contact line strongly.\n", "  Vector Stream Cipher (VSC) is a stream cipher which consists of permutation\npolynomial over a ring of modulo $2^w$. The algorithm for generating key stream\nis very simple and the encryption is very fast. Some theoretical attacks for\nVSC have been reported so far since the invention of VSC in 2004. Then, the\nauthors proposed some improvements and developed \"Vector Stream Cipher 2.0 (VSC\n2.0)\" to be immune against the theoretical attacks. In this paper, we propose\nfurther improvement of VSC 2.0 to publish as a new chaos cipher \"Vector Stream\nCipher 2.1 (VSC2.1)\". VSC 2.1 is faster and more secure than VSC 2.0. Our\nresult suggests that permutation polynomials over a ring of modulo $2^w$ are\nuseful for cryptography.\n", "  Spin-projected Hartree-Fock is introduced as a particle-hole excitation\nansatz over a symmetry-adapted reference determinant. Remarkably, this\nexpansion has an analytic expression that we were able to decipher. While the\nform of the polynomial expansion is universal, the excitation amplitudes need\nto be optimized. This is equivalent to the optimization of orbitals in the\nconventional projected Hartree-Fock framework of non-orthogonal determinants.\nUsing the inverse of the particle-hole expansion, we similarity transform the\nHamiltonian in a coupled-cluster style theory. The left eigenvector of the\nnon-hermitian Hamiltonian is constructed in a similar particle-hole expansion\nfashion, and we show that to numerically reproduce variational projected\nHartree-Fock results, one needs as many pair excitations in the bra as the\nnumber of strongly correlated entangled pairs in the system. This\nsingle-excitation polynomial similarity transformation theory is an alternative\nto our recently presented double excitation theory, but supports projected\nHartree-Fock and coupled cluster simultaneously rather than interpolating\nbetween them.\n", "  Holographic model of a three-dimensional current carrying superconductor or\nsuperfluid with {\\it dark matter} sector described by the additional\n$U(1)$-gauge field coupled to the ordinary Maxwell one, has been studied in the\nprobe limit. We investigated analytically by the Sturm-Liouville variational\nmethod, the holographic s-wave and p-wave models in the background of the AdS\nsoliton as well as five-dimensional AdS black hole spacetimes. The two models\nof p-wave superfluids were considered, the so called $SU(2)$ and the\nMaxwell-vector. Special attention has been paid to the dependence of the\ncritical chemical potential and critical transition temperature on the velocity\nof the condensate and {\\it dark matter} parameters. The current $J$ in\nholographic three-dimensional superconductor studied here, shows the linear\ndependence on $T_c-T$ for both s and p-wave symmetry. This is in a significant\ncontrast with the previously obtained results for two-dimensional\nsuperconductors, which reveal the $(T-T_c)^{3/2}$ temperature dependence. The\ncoupling constant $\\alpha$, as well as, chemical potential $\\mu_D$ and the\nvelocity $S_D$ of the {\\it dark matter}, affect the critical chemical potential\nof the p-wave holographic $SU(2)$ system. On the other hand, $\\alpha$, {\\it\ndark matter} velocity $S_D$ and density $\\rho_D$ determine the actual value of\nthe transition temperature of the same superconductor/superfluid set up.\nHowever, the {\\it dark matter} does not affect the value of the current.\n", "  We study the production of a light gauge boson in $K^- \\to \\pi^- X$ decay,\nwhere the associated new charge current is not conserved. It is found that the\nprocess can be generated by the tree-level $W$-boson annihilation and\nloop-induced $s\\to dX$. We find that it strongly depends on the $SU(3)$ limit\nor the unique gauge coupling to the quarks, whether the decay amplitude of\n$K^-\\to \\pi^- X$ in the $W$-boson annihilation is suppressed by $m^2_X\n\\epsilon_X \\cdot p_K$; however, no such suppression is found via the\nloop-induced $s\\to d X$. The constraints on the relevant couplings are studied.\n", "  The production of $W$ boson pairs in association with one jet in $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV is studied using data corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector during\n2012 at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The cross section is measured in a\nfiducial phase-space region defined by the presence of exactly one electron and\none muon, missing transverse momentum and exactly one jet with a transverse\nmomentum above 25 GeV and a pseudorapidity of $|\\eta|<4.5$. The leptons are\nrequired to have opposite electric charge and to pass transverse momentum and\npseudorapidity requirements. The fiducial cross section is found to be\n$\\sigma^{\\mathrm{fid,1\\textrm{-}jet}}_{WW}=136\\pm6($stat$)\\pm14($syst$)\\pm3($lumi$)$\nfb. In combination with a previous measurement restricted to leptonic final\nstates with no associated jets, the fiducial cross section of $WW$ production\nwith zero or one jet is measured to be\n$\\sigma^{\\mathrm{fid,}\\leq\\mathrm{1\\textrm{-}jet}}_{WW}=511\\pm9($stat$)\\pm26($syst$)\\pm10($lumi$)$\nfb. The ratio of fiducial cross sections in final states with one and zero jets\nis determined to be $0.36\\pm0.05$. Finally, a total cross section extrapolated\nfrom the fiducial measurement of $WW$ production with zero or one associated\njet is reported. The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions and\nfound in good agreement.\n", "  We report the discovery of a subtle infrared excess associated with the young\nwhite dwarf EC\\,05365--4749 at 3.35 and 4.6\\,$\\mu$m. Follow-up spectroscopic\nobservations are consistent with a hydrogen atmosphere white dwarf of effective\ntemperature 22\\,800\\,K and log [\\emph{g} (\\,cm\\,s$^{-2}$) ] = 8.19. High\nresolution spectroscopy reveals atmospheric metal pollution with logarithmic\nabundances of [Mg/H] = --5.36 and [Ca/H] = --5.75, confirming the white dwarf\nis actively accreting from a metal-rich source with an intriguing abundance\npattern. We find that the infrared excess is well modeled by a flat, opaque\ndebris disk, though disk parameters are not well constrained by the small\nnumber of infrared excess points. We further demonstrate that relaxing the\nassumption of a circular dusty debris disk to include elliptical disks expands\nthe widths of acceptable disks, adding an alternative interpretation to the\nsubtle infrared excesses commonly observed around young white dwarfs.\n", "  Previous statistical studies on the mechanical properties of\nchemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) suspended graphene membranes have been performed\nby means of measuring individual devices or with techniques that affect the\nmaterial. Here, we present a colorimetry technique as a parallel, non-invasive,\nand affordable way of characterizing suspended graphene devices. We exploit\nNewton rings interference patterns to study the deformation of a double-layer\ngraphene drum 13.2 micrometer in diameter when a pressure step is applied. By\nstudying the time evolution of the deformation, we find that filling the drum\ncavity with air is 2-5 times slower than when it is purged.\n", "  It is shown that the (driven) quantum Rabi model and its 2-photon and 2-mode\ngeneralizations possess a hidden $sl(2)$-algebraic structure which explains the\norigin of the quasi-exact solvability of these models. It manifests the first\nappearance of a hidden algebraic structure in quantum spin-boson systems\nwithout $U(1)$ symmetry.\n", "  We theoretically investigate spin transport in half-metallic ferromagnets at\nfinite temperatures. The side-jump and skew-scattering contributions to spin\nHall conductivity are derived using the Kubo formula. The electron-magnon\ninteraction causes a finite density of states in the energy gap of the\nminority-spin band and induces spin Hall conductivity. We show that spin Hall\nconductivity is proportional to $T^{3/2}$, with $T$ being temperature and is\nsensitive to $T$. We propose that spin Hall conductivity may be a tool to study\nthe minority-spin state.\n", "  We present measurements of two-particle correlations with neutral pion\ntrigger particles of transverse momenta $8 < p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm trig} <\n16~\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ and associated charged particles of $0.5 <\np_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc} < 10~\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ versus the azimuthal angle\ndifference $\\Delta\\varphi$ at midrapidity in pp and central Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV with ALICE. The new measurements exploit\nassociated charged hadrons down to $0.5~\\mathrm{GeV}/c$, which significantly\nextends our previous measurement that only used charged hadrons above\n$3~\\mathrm{GeV}/c$. After subtracting the contributions of the flow background,\n$v_2$ to $v_5$, the per-trigger yields are extracted for $|\\Delta\\varphi|<0.7$\non the near and for $|\\Delta\\varphi-\\pi| < 1.1$ on the away side. The ratio of\nper-trigger yields in Pb--Pb to those in pp collisions, $I_{\\mathrm{AA}}$, is\nmeasured on the near and away side for the $0$--$10$\\% most central Pb--Pb\ncollisions. On the away side, the per-trigger yields in Pb--Pb are strongly\nsuppressed to the level of $I_{\\mathrm{AA}} \\approx 0.6$ for\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc} > 3~\\mathrm{GeV}/c$, while with decreasing momenta\nan enhancement develops reaching about $5$ at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc}$.\nOn the near side, an enhancement of $I_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ between $1.2$ at the\nhighest to $1.8$ at the lowest $p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc}$ is observed. The\ndata are compared to parton-energy-loss predictions of the JEWEL and AMPT event\ngenerators, as well as to a perturbative QCD calculation with medium-modified\nfragmentation functions. All calculations qualitatively describe the away-side\nsuppression at high $p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc}$. Only AMPT captures the\nenhancement at low $p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm assoc}$, both on the near and away\nside. However, it also underpredicts $I_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ above $5$ GeV/$c$, in\nparticular on the near-side.\n", "  We present measurements of the reduction of light output by plastic\nscintillators irradiated in the CMS detector during the 8 TeV run of the Large\nHadron Collider and show that they indicate a strong dose rate effect. The\ndamage for a given dose is larger for lower dose rate exposures. The results\nagree with previous measurements of dose rate effects, but are stronger due to\nthe very low dose rates probed. We show that the scaling with dose rate is\nconsistent with that expected from diffusion effects.\n", "  Vortex lattices in rapidly rotating Bose--Einstein condensates are systems of\ntopological excitations that arrange themselves into periodic patterns. Here we\nshow how phase-imprinting techniques can be used to create a controllable\nnumber of defects in these lattices and examine the resulting dynamics. Even\nthough we describe our system using the mean-field Gross--Pitaevskii theory,\nthe full range of many particle effects among the vortices can be studied. In\nparticular we find the existence of localized vacancies that are quasi-stable\nover long periods of time, and characterize the effects on the background\nlattice through use of the orientational correlation function, and Delaunay\ntriangulation.\n", "  The new quantum principle of a time machine that is not using a smooth\ntimelike loops in Lorentz manifolds is described. The proposed time machine is\nbased on the destruction of interference of quantum superposition states in the\nWheeler superspace.\n", "  Charged particles in a magnetosphere are spontaneously attracted to a planet\nwhile increasing their kinetic energy via inward diffusion process. A\nconstraint on particles' micro-scale adiabatic invariants restricts the class\nof motions available to the system, giving rise to a proper frame on which\nparticle diffusion occurs. We investigate the inward diffusion process by\nnumerical simulation of particles on constrained phase space. The results\nreveal the emergence of inhomogeneous density gradient and anisotropic heating,\nwhich is consistent with spacecraft observations, experimental observations,\nand the recently formulated diffusion model on the constrained phase space.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium quantum phase transition of an Ising chain in a\ndissipative cavity driven by an external transverse light field. When driving\nand dissipation are in balance, the system can reach a nonequilibrium steady\nstate which undergoes a super-radiant phase transition as the driving strength\nincreases. Interestingly, the super-radiant field changes the effective bias of\nthe Ising chain in return and drives its own transition between the\nferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase. We study the rich physics in this system\nwith sophisticated behavior, and investigate important issues in its dynamics\nsuch as the stability of the system and criticality of the phase transition.\n", "  Numerical simulations have consistently shown that the reconnection rate in\ncertain collisionless regimes can be fast, on the order of $0.1 v_A B_u$, where\n$v_A$ and $B_u$ are the Alfv\\'en speed and the reconnecting magnetic field\nupstream of the ion diffusion region. This particular value has been reported\nin myriad numerical simulations under disparate conditions. However, despite\ndecades of research, the reasons underpinning this specific value remain\nmysterious. Here, we present an overview of this problem and discuss the\nconditions under which the \"0.1 value\" is attained. Furthermore, we explain why\nthis problem should be interpreted in terms of the ion diffusion region length.\n", "  Using the Hellmann--Feynman theorem we analyze the contribution of the\ndifferent terms of the nucleon-nucleon interaction to the spin symmetry energy\nof neutron matter. The analysis is performed within the microscopic\nBrueckner--Hartree--Fock approach using the Argonne V18 realistic potential\nplus the Urbana IX three-body force. The main contribution to the spin-symmetry\nenergy of neutron matter comes from the S=0 channel, acting only in the\nnon-polarized neutron matter, in particular the $^1S_0$ and the $^1D_2$ partial\nwaves. The importance of correlations in spin-polarized neutron matter is\nestimated by evaluating the kinetic energy difference between the correlated\nsystem and the underlying Fermi sea.\n", "  We report precursory seismic patterns prior to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes,\nas measured by four different methods based on changes in seismicity that can\nbe used for earthquake forecasting: the b-value method, two methods of seismic\nquiescence evaluation, and an analysis of seismicity density in space and time.\nThe spatial extent of precursory patterns differs from one method to the other\nand ranges from local scales (typically, asperity size) to regional scales\n(e.g., 2 degree x 3 degree around the source zone). The earthquakes were\npreceded by periods of pronounced anomalies, which lasted in yearly scales (1.5\nyears), or longer (> 3 years). We demonstrate that a combination of multiple\nmethods detected different signals prior to the Kumamoto earthquakes. This\nindicates great potential to reduce the hazard at possible future sites of\nearthquakes relative to long-term seismic hazard assessment. We also found that\nthe seismic quiescence in a regional scale area, detected by using the two\nmethods of seismic quiescence evaluation, was a common precursor to the 2016\nKumamoto earthquakes and 2015 Off Satsuma Peninsula earthquake. The result\nallows us to interpret both events as the onset that occurred at a section\nalong the tectonic line from the Okinawa Trough through the Beppu-Shimabara\ngraben.\n", "  We compute the hadronic matrix elements of the four-quark operators relevant\nfor $K^0-{\\bar K^0}$ mixing beyond the Standard Model. Our results are from\nlattice QCD simulations with $n_f=2+1$ flavours of domain-wall fermion, which\nexhibit continuum-like chiral-flavour symmetry. The simulations are performed\nat two different values of the lattice spacing ($a\\sim0.08$ and $a\\sim 0.11 \\,\n\\fm $) and with lightest unitary pion mass $\\sim 300\\, \\MeV$. For the first\ntime, the full set of relevant four-quark operators is renormalised\nnon-perturbatively through RI-SMOM schemes; a detailed description of the\nrenormalisation procedure is presented in a companion paper. We argue that the\nintermediate renormalisation scheme is responsible for the discrepancies found\nby different collaborations. We also study different normalisations and\ndetermine the matrix elements of the relevant four-quark operators with a\nprecision of $\\sim 5\\%$ or better.\n", "  Impulsive X-ray Raman excitations of Lithium, Neon, and Sodium are calculated\nusing the Multiconfiguration Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock method. Using linearly\npolarized laser pulses without chirp, we determine the optimum central\nfrequency, intensity, and duration for maximum population transfer to valence\nexcited states. We demonstrate the existence of two local optima or \"sweet\nspots\" for population transfer, either of which, depending on the system, may\nbe superior. For some systems we find that population transfer can be maximized\nby nonresonant Raman transitions, red-detuned below K-edge, because such\ndetuning minimizes core-excited populations and ionization loss. For instance,\nin Neon near the K-edge the global optimum for population transfer occurs at\nhigh intensity (8 $\\times$ 10$^{19}$ W cm$^{-2}$), short duration (82as\nfull-width-at-half-maximum), and 24eV red-detuned from the K-edge.\n", "  Small angle neutron inelastic scattering measurement has been performed to\nstudy the magnon dispersion relation in the field-induced-ferromagnetic phase\nof the noncentrosymmetric binary compound MnSi. For the magnons propagating\nparallel or anti-parallel to the external magnetic field, we experimentally\nconfirmed that the dispersion relation is asymmetrically shifted along the\nmagnetic field direction. This magnon dispersion shift is attributed to the\nrelativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which is finite in\nnoncentrosymmetric magnets, such as MnSi. The shift direction is found to be\nswitchable by reversing the external magnetic field direction.\n", "  We revisit the suggestion that charged rho-mesons undergo Bose-Einstein\ncondensation in isospin-rich nuclear matter. Using a simple version of the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, we conclude that rho-meson condensation is\neither avoided or postponed to isospin chemical potentials much higher than the\nrho-meson mass as a consequence of the repulsive interaction with the preformed\npion condensate. In order to support our numerical results, we work out a\nlinear sigma model for pions and rho-mesons, showing that the two models lead\nto similar patterns of medium dependence of meson masses. As a byproduct, we\nanalyze in detail the mapping between the NJL model and the linear sigma model,\nfocusing on conditions that must be satisfied for a quantitative agreement\nbetween the models.\n", "  We review topics related to the first moment of azimuthal anisotropy ($v_1$),\ncommonly known as directed flow, focusing on both charged particles and\nidentified particles from heavy-ion collisions. Beam energies from the highest\navailable, at the CERN LHC, down to projectile kinetic energies per nucleon of\na few GeV per nucleon, as studied in experiments at the Brookhaven AGS, fall\nwithin our scope. We focus on experimental measurements and on theoretical work\nwhere direct comparisons with experiment have been emphasized. The physics\naddressed or potentially addressed by this review topic includes the study of\nQuark Gluon Plasma, and more generally, investigation of the Quantum\nChromodynamics phase diagram and the equation of state describing the\naccessible phases.\n", "  Approximate density functional theory (DFT) suffers from many-electron self-\ninteraction error, otherwise known as delocalization error, that may be\ndiagnosed and then corrected through elimination of the deviation from exact\npiecewise linear behavior between integer electron numbers. Although paths to\ncorrection of energetic delocalization error are well- established, the impact\nof these corrections on the electron density is less well-studied. Here, we\ncompare the effect on density delocalization of DFT+U, global hybrid tuning,\nand range- separated hybrid tuning on a diverse test set of 32 transition metal\ncomplexes and observe the three methods to have qualitatively equivalent\neffects on the ground state density. Regardless of valence orbital diffuseness\n(i.e., from 2p to 5p), ligand electronegativity (i.e., from Al to O), basis set\n(i.e., plane wave versus localized basis set), metal (i.e., Ti, Fe, Ni) and\nspin state, or tuning method, we consistently observe substantial charge loss\nat the metal and gain at ligand atoms (ca. 0.3-0.5 e or more). This charge loss\nat the metal is preferentially from the minority spin, leading to increasing\nmagnetic moment as well. Using accurate wavefunction theory references, we\nobserve that a minimum error in partial charges and magnetic moments occur at\nhigher tuning parameters than typically employed to eliminate energetic\ndelocalization error. These observations motivate the need to develop\nmulti-faceted approximate-DFT error correction approaches that separately treat\ndensity delocalization and energetic errors in order to recover both correct\ndensity and magnetization properties.\n", "  We propose a semi-discrete scheme for 2D Keller-Segel equations based on a\nsymmetrization reformation, which is equivalent to the convex splitting method\nand is free of any nonlinear solver. We show that, this new scheme is\nunconditionally stable as long as the initial condition does not exceed certain\nthreshold, and it asymptotically preserves the quasi-static limit in the\ntransient regime. Furthermore, we prove that the fully discrete scheme is\nconservative and positivity preserving, which makes it ideal for simulations.\nThe analogical schemes for the radial symmetric cases and the subcritical\ndegenerate cases are also presented and analyzed. With extensive numerical\ntests, we verify the claimed properties of the methods and demonstrate their\nsuperiority in various challenging applications.\n", "  If the negative cosmological constant is treated as a dynamical pressure and\nif the volume be its thermodynamically conjugate variable then the\ngravitational mass can be expressed as the total gravitational enthalpy rather\nthan the energy. Under these circumstances, a new phenomena emerges in the\ncontext of extended phase space thermodynamics. We \\emph{examine} here these\nfeatures for recently discovered Van-der-Waal (VDW) black hole (BH)\n\\cite{mann15} which is analogous to the VDW fluid. We show that the\nthermodynamic volume is \\emph{greater} than the naive geometric volume. We also\nshow that the \\emph{Smarr-Gibbs-Duhem} relation is satisfied for this BH.\nFurthermore, by computing the thermal specific heat we find the local\nthermodynamic stability criterion for this BH. It has been observed that the BH\ndoes \\emph{not} possess any kind of second order phase transition. This is an\ninteresting feature of VDW BH by its own right. Moreover, we also derive\n\\emph{Cosmic-Censorship-Inequality} for this class of BH. In addition finally,\nwe compute the \\emph{logarithmic correction} to the entropy of this BH due to\nthe quantum fluctuations around the thermal equilibrium.\n", "  The one-loop corrections to the weak mixing angle $\\sin^2\\theta_{eff}^b$\nderived from the $Z{\\bar b}b$ vertex, are known since 1985. It took another 30\nyears to calculate the complete electroweak two-loop corrections to\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{eff}^b$. The main obstacle was the calculation of the O(700)\nbosonic two-loop vertex integrals with up to three mass scales, at $s=M_Z^2$.\nWe did not perform the usual integral reduction and master evaluation, but\nchose a completely numerical approach, using two different calculational\nchains. One method relies on publicly available sector decomposition\nimplementations. Further, we derived Mellin-Barnes (MB) representations,\nexploring the publicly available MB suite. We had to supplement the MB suite by\ntwo new packages: AMBRE~3, a Mathematica program, for the efficient treatment\nof non-planar integrals and MBnumerics for advanced numerics in the Minkowskian\nspace-time. Our preliminary result for LL2016, the \"dessert\", for the\nelectroweak bosonic two-loop contributions to $\\sin^2\\theta_{eff}^b$ is:\n$\\Delta \\sin^2\\theta_{eff}^{b(\\alpha^2,\\rm bos)} = \\sin^2\\theta_W ~\n\\Delta\\kappa_b^{(\\alpha^2,bos)}$, with $\\Delta\\kappa_b^{(\\alpha^2,bos)} =\n-1.0276 x 10^{-4}$. This contribution is about a quarter of the corresponding\nfermionic corrections and of about the same magnitude as several of the known\nhigher-order QCD corrections. The $\\sin^2\\theta_{eff}^b$ is now predicited in\nthe Standard Model with a relative error of $10^{-4}$ [1].\n", "  It is well-known that (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons term may lead to\ntopological Meissner effect. However, we show that 3-dimensional Chern-Simons\nterm, which is different from (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons term, will instead\ndestroy traditional Meissner effect. This means that the presence of a\n3-dimensional Chern-Simons term naturally guarantees the validity of\n\"pre-formed pairs\" picture explaining high-T_c superconductivity, because such\na term breaks Meissner effect induced by paired electrons. In particular, if\n3-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge fields indeed emerge in the \"pre-formed pairs\"\nregime, our theory predicts that around the transition temperature T_c the Hall\nconductivity {\\sigma} should exhibit a scaling law {\\sigma}->(T-T_c )^(2/D)\nwith D being the dimension of the superconducting material.\n", "  The poor structural stability of phosphorene in air was commonly ascribed to\nhumidity and oxygen molecules. Recent exfoliation of phosphorene in\ndeoxygenated water promotes the need to re-examine the role of H2O and O2\nmolecules. Considering the presence of high population of vacancies in\nphosphorene, we investigate the interaction of H2O and O2 molecules with\nvacancy-contained phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In contrast\nto the common notion that physisorbed molecules tend to have a stronger\nadsorption at vacancy sites, we show that H2O has nearly the same adsorption\nenergy at the vacancy site as that at the perfect one. Charge transfer analysis\nshows that O2 is a strong electron scavenger, which transfers the lone-pair\nelectrons of the phosphorus atoms to the 2{\\pi}* antibonding orbital of O2. As\na result, the barrier for the O-O bond splitting to form O-P bonds is reduced\nfrom 0.81 eV at the perfect site to 0.59 eV at the defect site, leading to an\nabout 5000 faster oxidizing rate at the defect site than at the perfect site at\nroom temperature. Hence, our work reveals that the vacancy in phosphorene shows\na stronger oxygen affinity than the perfect phosphorene lattice site.\nStructural degradation of phosphorene due to oxidization may occur rapidly at\nedges and grain boundaries where vacancies tend to agglomerate.\n", "  The evaluation of the magnetic field inside and outside a uniform current\ndensity infinite solenoid of uniform cross-section is an elementary problem in\nclassical electrodynamics that all undergraduate Physics students study.\nSymmetry properties of the cylinder and the judicious use of Ampere's circuital\nlaw leads to correct results; however it does not explain why the field is non\nzero for a finite length solenoid, and why it vanishes as the solenoid becomes\ninfinitely long. An argument is provided in (American Journal of Physics 69,\n751 (2001)) by Farley and Price, explaining how the magnetic field behaves\noutside the solenoid and not too far from it, as a function of the length of\nthe solenoid. A calculation is also outlined for obtaining the field just\noutside the circular cross section solenoid, in the classic text Classical\nElectrodynamics by J.D.Jackson, 3rd ed, (John Wiley and Sons, INC) Problems\n5.3, 5.4, 5.5. The purpose of this letter is to provide an elementary argument\nfor why the field becomes negligible as the length of the solenoid is\nincreased. An elementary calculation is provided for the field outside the\nsolenoid, at radial distances large compared to the linear dimension of the\nsolenoid cross section.\n", "  Community detection is a classical problem in the field of graph mining.\nWhile most algorithms work on the entire graph, it is often interesting in\npractice to recover only the community containing some given set of seed nodes.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach to this problem, using some\nlow-dimensional embedding of the graph based on random walks starting from the\nseed nodes. From this embedding, we propose some simple yet efficient versions\nof the PageRank algorithm as well as a novel algorithm, called WalkSCAN, that\nis able to detect multiple communities, possibly overlapping. We provide\ninsights into the performance of these algorithms through the theoretical\nanalysis of a toy network and show that WalkSCAN outperforms existing\nalgorithms on real networks.\n", "  Motivated by single-molecule experiments on synaptic membrane protein\ndomains, we use a stochastic lattice model to study protein reaction and\ndiffusion processes in crowded membranes. We find that the stochastic\nreaction-diffusion dynamics of synaptic proteins provide a simple physical\nmechanism for collective fluctuations in synaptic domains, the molecular\nturnover observed at synaptic domains, key features of the single-molecule\ntrajectories observed for synaptic proteins, and spatially inhomogeneous\nprotein lifetimes at the cell membrane. Our results suggest that central\naspects of the single-molecule and collective dynamics observed for membrane\nprotein domains can be understood in terms of stochastic reaction-diffusion\nprocesses at the cell membrane.\n", "  I present results from the first lattice QCD calculations of axial-current\nmatrix elements in light nuclei, performed by the NPLQCD collaboration.\nPrecision calculations of these matrix elements, and the subsequent extraction\nof multi-nucleon axial-current operators, are essential in refining theoretical\npredictions of the proton-proton fusion cross section, neutrino-nucleus cross\nsections and $\\beta\\beta$-decay rates of nuclei. In addition, they are expected\nto shed light on the phenomenological quenching of $g_A$ that is required in\nnuclear many-body calculations.\n", "  Recently there has been reinvigorated interest in the superconducting\nproximity effect, driven by predictions of the emergence of Majorana fermions.\nTo help guide this search, we have developed a phenomenological model for the\ntunneling spectra in anisotropic superconductor-normal metal proximity devices.\nWe combine successful approaches used in s-wave proximity and standard d-wave\ntunneling to reproduce tunneling spectra in d-wave proximity devices, and\nclarify the origin of various features. Different variations of the pair\npotential are considered, resulting from the proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity. Furthermore, the effective pair potential felt by the\nquasiparticles is momentum-dependent in contrast to s-wave superconductors. The\nprobabilities of reflection and transmission are calculated by solving the\nBogoliubov equations. Our results are consistent with experimental observations\nof the unconventional proximity effect and provide important experimental\nparameters such as the size and length scale of the proximity induced gap, as\nwell as the conditions needed to observe the reduced and full superconducting\ngaps.\n", "  Noise subtraction techniques can help reduce the statistical uncertainty in\nthe extraction of hard to detect signals. We describe new noise subtraction\nmethods in Lattice QCD which apply to disconnected diagram evaluations. Some of\nthe noise suppression techniques include polynomial quark matrix methods,\neigenspectrum deflation methods, and combination methods. Our most promising\ntechnique combines polynomial and Hermitian deflation subtraction methods. The\noverall goal is to improve the efficiency of Lattice QCD noise method\nalgorithms.\n", "  In this paper, a novel lateral quantum well solar cell has been introduced,\nand the structural parameters effects of these nano-structures on the\nperformance of the device have been investigated. For modeling, the continuity\nequation has been solved in the quasi neutral regions. However, to analyze the\nquantum wells' effects, first the Schrodinger and Poisson equations have been\nsolved self-consistently. To find the absorption coefficient derived from the\nFermi's golden rule, the obtained Eigen states and energies and also the\neffects of multilayers using Transfer Matrix Method have been employed. Then,\nto find the solar cell performance parameters, all radiative and non-radiative\nrecombinations have been accounted. It is found that modifying different\ngeometrical parameters, including the thickness of the system, the widths of\nthe wells and barriers, and also some structural parameters such as the\nbarriers' mole fraction could noticeably influence the characteristics of the\ndevice. So, optimizing these parameters is necessary to obtain a good\nefficiency.\n", "  In this paper, a survey of the recent results about the classification of the\nconnected holonomy groups of the Lorentzian manifolds is given. A\nsimplification of the construction of the Lorentzian metrics with all possible\nconnected holonomy groups is obtained. As the applications, the Einstein\nequation, Lorentzian manifolds with parallel and recurrent spinor fields,\nconformally flat Walker metrics and the classification of 2-symmetric\nLorentzian manifolds are considered.\n", "  It is explained how to find the de~Rham decomposition of a Riemannian\nmanifold and the Wu decomposition of a Lorentzian manifold. For that it is\nenough to find parallel symmetric bilinear forms on the manifold, and do some\nlinear algebra. This result will allow to compute the connected holonomy group\nof an arbitrary Riemannian or Lorentzian manifold.\n", "  Since the first successful synthesis of graphene just over a decade ago, a\nvariety of two-dimensional (2D) materials (e.g., transition\nmetal-dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron-nitride, etc.) have been discovered.\nAmong the many unique and attractive properties of 2D materials, mechanical\nproperties play important roles in manufacturing, integration and performance\nfor their potential applications. Mechanics is indispensable in the study of\nmechanical properties, both experimentally and theoretically. The coupling\nbetween the mechanical and other physical properties (thermal, electronic,\noptical) is also of great interest in exploring novel applications, where\nmechanics has to be combined with condensed matter physics to establish a\nscalable theoretical framework. Moreover, mechanical interactions between 2D\nmaterials and various substrate materials are essential for integrated device\napplications of 2D materials, for which the mechanics of interfaces (adhesion\nand friction) has to be developed for the 2D materials. Here we review recent\ntheoretical and experimental works related to mechanics and mechanical\nproperties of 2D materials. While graphene is the most studied 2D material to\ndate, we expect continual growth of interest in the mechanics of other 2D\nmaterials beyond graphene.\n", "  It is very common to observe crowds of individuals solving similar problems\nwith similar information in a largely independent manner. We argue here that\ncrowds can become \"smarter,\" i.e., more efficient and robust, by partially\nfollowing the average opinion. This observation runs counter to the widely\naccepted claim that the wisdom of crowds deteriorates with social influence.\nThe key difference is that individuals are self-interested and hence will\nreject feedbacks that do not improve their performance. We propose a\ncontrol-theoretic methodology to compute the degree of social influence, i.e.,\nthe level to which one accepts the population feedback, that optimizes\nperformance. We conducted an experiment with human subjects ($N = 194$), where\nthe participants were first asked to solve an optimization problem\nindependently, i.e., under no social influence. Our theoretical methodology\nestimates a $30\\%$ degree of social influence to be optimal, resulting in a\n$29\\%$ improvement in the crowd's performance. We then let the same cohort\nsolve a new problem and have access to the average opinion. Surprisingly, we\nfind the average degree of social influence in the cohort to be $32\\%$ with a\n$29\\%$ improvement in performance: In other words, the crowd self-organized\ninto a near-optimal setting. We believe this new paradigm for making crowds\n\"smarter\" has the potential for making a significant impact on a diverse set of\nfields including population health to government planning. We include a case\nstudy to show how a crowd of states can collectively learn the level of\ntaxation and expenditure that optimizes economic growth.\n", "  Increasing the distance from which an antineutrino detector is capable of\nmonitoring the operation of a registered reactor, or discovering a clandestine\nreactor, strengthens the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. This\nreport presents calculations of reactor antineutrino interactions, from\nquasi-elastic neutrino-proton scattering and elastic neutrino-electron\nscattering, in a water-based detector operated >10 km from a commercial power\nreactor. It separately calculates signal from the proximal reactor and\nbackground from all other registered reactors. The main results are interaction\nrates and kinetic energy distributions of charged leptons scattered from\nquasi-elastic and elastic processes. Comparing signal and background\ndistributions evaluates reactor monitoring capability. Scaling the results to\ndetectors of different sizes, target media, and standoff distances is\nstraightforward. Calculations are for two examples of a commercial reactor\n(P_th~3 GW) operating nearby (L~20 km) an underground facility capable of\nhosting a detector (~1 kT H2O) project. These reactor-site combinations are\nPerry-Morton on the southern shore of Lake Erie in the U.S. and\nHartlepool-Boulby on the western shore of the North Sea in U.K.. The signal\nfrom the proximal reactor is about five times greater at the Morton site than\nat the Boulby site due to shorter reactor-site separation distance, larger\nreactor thermal power, and greater neutrino oscillation survival probability.\nIn terms of absolute interaction rate, background from all other reactors is\nlarger at Morton than at Boulby. However, the fraction of the total rate is\nsmaller at Morton than at Boulby. Moreover, the Hartlepool power plant has two\ncores whereas the Perry plant has a single core. The Boulby site, therefore,\noffers an opportunity for demonstrating remote reactor monitoring under more\nstringent conditions than does the Morton site.\n", "  The concept of scalability analysis of numerical parallel applications has\nbeen revisited, with the specific goals defined for the performance estimation\nof research applications. A series of Community Climate Model System (CCSM)\nnumerical simulations were used to test the several MPI implementations,\ndetermine optimal use of the system resources, and their scalability. The\nscaling capacity and model throughput performance metrics for $N$ cores showed\na log-linear behavior approximated by a power fit in the form of $C(N)=bN^a$,\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are two empirical constants. Different metrics yielded\nidentical power coefficients ($a$), but different dimensionality coefficients\n($b$). This model was consistent except for the large numbers of N. The power\nfit approach appears to be very useful for scalability estimates, especially\nwhen no serial testing is possible. Scalability analysis of additional\nscientific application has been conducted in the similar way to validate the\nrobustness of the power fit approach.\n", "  We study the wormhole spacetime configurations in bulk viscosity cosmology.\nConsidering three classes of viscous models, i.e., bulk viscosity as a function\nof Hubble parameter $H$, temperature $T$ and dark energy density $\\rho$,\nrespectively, we obtain nine wormhole solutions. Through the analysis for the\nanisotropic solutions, we conclude that, to some extent, these three classes of\nviscous models have very high degeneracy with each other. Subsequently, without\nthe loss of generality, to investigate the traversabilities, energy conditions\nand stability for the wormhole solution, we study the wormhole solution of the\nconstant redshift function of the viscous $\\omega$CDM model with a constant\nbulk viscosity coefficient. We obtain the following conclusions: the value of\ntraversal velocity decreases for decreasing bulk viscosity, and the traversal\nvelocity for a traveler depends on not only the wormhole geometry but also the\neffects of cosmological background evolution; the null energy condition will be\nviolated more clearly when the bulk viscosity or the cosmic expansion velocity\ndecreases; for the case of a positive surface energy density, the range of the\njunction radius decreases and the values of the parameter $\\lambda$ are further\nrestricted when the throat radius of the wormhole $r_0/M$ increases, bulk\nviscosity coefficient $\\zeta_0$ decreases and Hubble parameter $H$ decreases,\nrespectively; for the case of a negative surface energy density, by increasing\n$r_0/M$, decreasing $\\zeta_0$ and increasing $H$, the values of the parameter\n$\\lambda$ are less restricted, one may conclude that the total stability region\nincreases, and the range of the junction radius increases, increases and\ndecreases, respectively.\n", "  UVO0825+15 is a hot bright helium-rich subdwarf which lies in {\\it K2} Field\n5 and in a sample of intermediate helium-rich subdwarfs observed with {\\it\nSubaru/HDS}. The {\\it K2} light curve shows low-amplitude variations, whilst\nthe {\\it Subaru} spectrum shows Pb{\\sc iv} absorption lines, indicative of a\nvery high lead overabundance. UVO0825+15 also has a high proper motion with\nkinematics typical for a thick disk star. Analyses of ultraviolet and\nintermediate dispersion optical spectra rule out a short-period binary\ncompanion, and provide fundamental atmospheric parameters of $T_{\\rm\noff}=38\\,900\\pm270$\\,K, $\\log g/{\\rm cm\\,s^{-2}}=5.97\\pm0.11$,\n  $\\log n_{\\rm He}/n_{\\rm H}=-0.57\\pm0.01$, $E_{B-V}\\approx0.03$, and angular\nradius $\\theta = 1.062\\pm0.006\\times10^{-11}$ radians (formal errors). The\nhigh-resolution spectrum shows that carbon is $>2$ dex subsolar, iron is\napproximately solar and all other elements heavier than argon are at least 2 --\n4 dex overabundant, including germanium, yttrium and lead. Approximately 150\nlines in the blue-optical spectrum remain unidentified. The chemical structure\nof the photosphere is presumed to be determined by radiatively-dominated\ndiffusion. The {\\it K2} light curve shows a dominant period around 10.8\\,h,\nwith a variable amplitude, its first harmonic, and another period at 13.3\\,h.\nThe preferred explanation is multi-periodic non-radial oscillation due to\ng-modes with very high radial order, although this presents difficulties for\npulsation theory. Alternative explanations fail for lack of radial-velocity\nevidence. UVO0825+15 represents the fourth member of a group of hot subdwarfs\nhaving helium-enriched photospheres and 3--4 dex overabundances of trans-iron\nelements, and is the first lead-rich subdwarf to show evidence of pulsations.\n", "  The determination of the luminosity function (LF) in gamma ray bursts (GRBs)\ndepends on the adopted cosmology, each one characterized by its corresponding\nluminosity distance. Here we analyse three cosmologies: the standard cosmology,\nthe plasma cosmology, and the pseudo-Euclidean universe. The LF of the GRBs is\nfirstly modeled by the lognormal distribution and the four broken power law,\nand secondly by a truncated lognormal distribution. The truncated lognormal\ndistribution fits acceptably the range in luminosity of GRBs as a function of\nthe redshift.\n", "  We present the first study of the multiscaling of time-dependent velocity and\nmagnetic-field structure functions in homogeneous, isotropic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in three dimensions. We generalize the\nformalism that has been developed for analogous studies of time-dependent\nstructure functions in fluid turbulence to MHD. By carrying out detailed\nnumerical studies of such time-dependent structure functions in a shell model\nfor three-dimensional MHD turbulence, we obtain both equal-time and dynamic\nscaling exponents.\n", "  Periodic structures have interesting acoustic and vibration properties making\nthem suitable for a wide variety of applications. In a periodic structure, the\nnumber of frequencies for each wavevector depends on the degree of freedom of\nthe unit cell. In this paper, we investigate the number of wavevectors for each\nfrequency. This analysis defines the upper bound for the maximum number of\nwavevectors for each frequency in a general periodic structure which might\ninclude damping. Investigation presented in this paper can also provide an\ninsight for designing materials in which the interaction between unit cells is\nnot limited to the closest neighbor. As an example application of this work, we\ninvestigate phonon dispersion curves in hexagonal form of Boron Nitride to show\nthat first neighbor interaction is not sufficient to model dispersion curves\nwith force-constant-model.\n", "  We report on the improved measurement of the hyperfine structure of\n$4f^{12}(^3 H_6)5d_{5/2}6s^2$ $(J=9/2)$ excited state in Tm-169 which is\ninvolved in the second-stage laser cooling of Tm. To measure the absolute value\nof the hyperfine splitting interval we used Doppler-free frequency modulation\nsaturated absorption spectroscopy of Tm atoms in a vapor cell. The sign of the\nhyperfine constant was determined independently by spectroscopy of laser cooled\nTm atoms. The hyperfine constant of the level equals $A_J=-422.112(32)$ MHz\nthat corresponds to the energy difference between two hyperfine sublevels of\n$-2110.56(16)$~MHz. In relation to the saturated absorption measurement we\nquantitatively treat contributions of various mechanisms into the line\nbroadening and shift. We consider power broadening in the case when Zeeman\nsublevels of atomic levels are taken into account. We also discuss the line\nbroadening due to frequency modulation and relative intensities of transitions\nin saturated-absorption experiments.\n", "  In this study, we present the results obtained from KIC 9761199's the\nphotometrical data acquired by the Kepler Mission. The light curve of the\nsystem, the sinusoidal variation out-of-eclipses and instant-short term flare\nevents in the entire light curves were analyzed. The temperature of the\nsecondary component was found to be 3891+-1 K, while the mass ratio of the\ncomponents (q) was found to be 0.69+-0.01, and the orbital inclination (i) was\ncomputed as 77.4+-0.1 degrees. The sinusoidal variation is caused by the\nstellar spots of two active regions separated by about 180 degrees\nlongitudinally located around the latitudes of +47 and +30 degrees. In\naddition, 94 flares were detected and their parameters were computed. The OPEA\nmodel was derived for these flares and its parameters were computed. The\nPlateau value as saturation level for the active component was found to be\n1.951+-0.069 s, while the half-life value was found to be 1014 s. The flare\nfrequency N1 was found to be 0.01351 per hour, while the flare frequency N2 was\nfound to be 0.00006. Maximum flare rise time (Tr) was found to be 1118.098 s,\nwhile maximum flare total time (Tt) was found to be 6767.72 s. Comparing its\nanalogue it is seen that the chromospheric activity level of KIC 9761199, which\nis a low-mass close binary system according to the light curve analyses, is an\nexpected level according to the (B-V) color index of 1.303 mag for the active\ncomponent.\n", "  In this paper we reconsider the classical nonlinear diffusivity equation of\nreal gas in an heterogenous porous medium in light of the recent studies about\nthe generalized fractional equation of conservation of mass. We first recall\nthe physical meaning of the fractional conservation of mass recently studied by\nWheatcraft and Meerschaert (2008) and then consider the implications in the\nclassical model of diffusion of a real gas in a porous medium. Then we show\nthat the obtained equation can be simply linearized into a classical\nspace-fractional diffusion equation, widely studied in the literature. We also\nconsider the case of a power-law pressure-dependence of the permeability\ncoefficient. In this case we provide some useful exact analytical results. In\nparticular, we are able to find a Barenblatt-type solution for a\nspace-fractional Boussinesq equation, arising in this context.\n", "  Recent studies show the importance of the star formation feedback in changing\nthe energetic and structure of galaxies. Dissecting the physics of the feedback\nis hence crucial to understand the evolution of galaxies. Full polarization\nradio continuum surveys can be ideally performed to trace not only star\nformation but also the energetic components of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nthe magnetic fields and cosmic ray electrons. Using the SKA precursors, we\ninvestigate the effect of the massive star formation on the ISM energy balance\nin nearby galaxies. Our multi-scale and multi-frequency surveys show that\ncosmic rays are injected in star forming regions and lose energy propagating\naway from their birth place. Due to the star formation feedback, cosmic ray\nelectron population becomes younger and more energetic. Star formation also\namplifies the turbulent magnetic field inserting a high pressure which is\nimportant in energy balance in the ISM and structure formation in the host\ngalaxy.\n", "  We present a theory for the toughness, damage tolerance, and tensile strength\nof a class of hierarchical, fractal, metamaterials. We show that the even\nthough the absolute toughness and damage tolerance decrease with increasing\nnumber of hierarchical scales, the specific toughness (toughness per-unit\ndensity) grows with increasing number of hierarchical scales in the material,\nwhile the specific tensile strength and damage tolerance remain constant.\n", "  Hard probes created through large momentum transfers are used to study the\nproperties of QCD matter created in heavy-ion collisions, by comparing the\nmeasurements to those in p+p collisions. Jets, and the \"quenching\" or\nsuppression of jets in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions, are studied\nthrough various different observables. We present the most recent measurements\nfrom $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions, with p+p collisions as the\nreference, by the STAR Collaboration. The observables are semi-inclusive\ncharged jets and di-jet transverse momentum imbalance. Additionally,\ncorrelation measurements of direct photon-hadron and neutral pion-hadron are\npresented and discussed.\n", "  The sample of classic Cepheids with known distances and line-of-sight\nvelocities is supplemented by the proper motions from the Gaia DR1 catalog.\nFrom spatial velocities of 260 stars the components of the peculiar Solar\nvelocity:\n  (U,V,W)_\\odot=(7.90,11.73,7.39)+/-(0.65,0.77,0.62) km/s, parameters of the\nGalactic rotation curve: \\Omega_0 =28.840+/-.33 km/s/kpc,\n\\Omega'_0=-4.05+/-0.10 km/s/kpc^2, \\Omega''_0=0.805+/-0.067 km/s/kpc^3 are\nobtained. For the adopted Galactocentric Solar distance R_0=8 kpc the linear\ncircular velocity of the Local Standard of Rest is found as V_0=231+/-6 km/s.\n", "  Lipid droplets (LDs) are subcellular organelles with important roles in lipid\nstorage and metabolism and involved in various diseases including cancer,\nobesity, and diabetes. Conventional methods, however, have limited ability to\nprovide quantitative information on individual LDs and have limited capability\nfor three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of LDs in live cells especially for fast\nacquisition of 3-D dynamics. Here, we present an optical method based on 3-D\nquantitative phase imaging to measure the 3-D structural distribution and\nbiochemical parameters (concentration and dry mass) of individual LDs in live\ncells without using exogenous labelling agents. The biochemical change of LDs\nunder oleic acid treatment was quantitatively investigated, and 4-D tracking of\nthe fast dynamics of LDs revealed the intracellular transport of LDs in live\ncells.\n", "  We derive the expressions for the local, on-shell closed co-dimension 2 forms\nin the Cartan formulation of general relativity and explicitly show their\nequivalence to those of the metric formulation.\n", "  We discuss a simple singular system in two dimension, two heavy particles\ninteracting with a light particle via an attractive contact interaction.\nAlthough intuitively clear the actual application of the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation to this problem is quite subtle. Nevertheless, with due care we\nshow that this can be done, as a result we calculate the leading term of the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation and indicate how to get the higher order\ncorrections.\n", "  We review the Carlotto-Schoen construction of general relativistic initial\ndata sets which are trivial outside of cones, discuss the context, the\nimplications, and some further developments.\n", "  Using an unusual type of symmetric average, we show that for several common\nequations involving quite general potentials possessing symmetry, the ground\nstate, if it exists, must also be symmetric.\n", "  The Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research\n(CASPER) has been working for a decade to reduce the time and cost of\ndesigning, building and deploying new digital radio-astronomy instruments.\nToday, CASPER open-source technology powers over 45 scientific instruments\nworldwide, and is used by scientists and engineers at dozens of academic\ninstitutions. In this paper we catalog the current offerings of the CASPER\ncollaboration, and instruments past and present built by CASPER users and\ndevelopers. We describe the ongoing state of software development, as CASPER\nlooks to support a broader range of programming environments and hardware and\nensure compatibility with the latest vendor tools.\n", "  We use 3.6 $\\mu$m photometry for 1154 disk galaxies ($i<65^{\\circ}$) in the\nSpitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G, Sheth et al. 2010)\nto obtain the stellar component of the circular velocity. By combining the\ndisk+bulge rotation curves with HI line width measurements from the literature,\nwe estimate the ratio of the halo-to-stellar mass ($M_{\\rm halo}/M_{\\ast}$)\nwithin the optical disk, and compare it to the total stellar mass ($M_{\\ast}$).\nWe find the $M_{\\rm halo}/M_{\\ast}$-$M_{\\ast}$ relation in good agreement with\nthe best-fit model at z$\\approx$0 in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulations\n(e.g. Moster et al. 2010), assuming that the dark matter halo within the\noptical radius comprises a constant fraction ($\\sim4\\%$) of its total mass.\n", "  The prospects of studying nonminimal operators for Lorentz violation using\nspectroscopy experiments with light atoms and muon spin-precession experiments\nare presented. Possible improvements on bounds on minimal and nonminimal\noperators for Lorentz violation are discussed.\n", "  Emission profiles of the resonantly scattered OII~83.4~nm triplet can in\nprinciple be used to estimate \\(\\mathrm{O}^+\\) density profiles in the F2\nregion of the ionosphere. Given the emission source profile, solution of this\ninverse problem is possible, but requires significant computation. The\ntraditional Feautrier solution to the radiative transfer problem requires many\niterations to converge, making it time-consuming to compute. A Markov chain\napproach to the problem produces similar results by directly constructing a\nmatrix that maps the source emission rate to an effective emission rate which\nincludes scattering to all orders. The Markov chain approach presented here\nyields faster results and therefore can be used to perform the \\(\\mathrm{O}^+\\)\ndensity retrieval with higher resolution than would otherwise be possible.\n", "  The electronic states occurring in a double vacancy defect for graphene\nnanoribbons have been calculated in detail based on a pyrene model. Extended ab\ninitio calculations using the MR configuration interaction (MRCI) method have\nbeen performed to describe in a balanced way the manifold of electronic states\nderived from the dangling bonds created by initial removal of two neighboring\ncarbon atoms from the graphene network. In total, this study took into account\nthe characterization of 16 electronic states (eight singlets and eight\ntriplets) considering unrelaxed and relaxed defect structures. The ground state\nwas found to be of 1Ag character with around 50% closed shell character. The\ngeometry optimization process leads to the formation of two five-membered rings\nin a pentagon octagon pentagon structure. The closed shell character increases\nthereby to ~70%, the analysis of unpaired density shows only small\ncontributions confirming the chemical stability of that entity. For the\nunrelaxed structure the first five excited states (3B3g, 3B2u, 3B1u, 3Au and\n1Au) are separated from the ground state by less than 2.5 eV. For comparison,\nunrestricted density functional theory (DFT) calculations using several types\nof functionals have been performed within different symmetry subspaces defined\nby the open shell orbitals. Comparison with the MRCI results gave good\nagreement in terms of finding the 1Ag state as ground state and in assigning\nthe lowest excited states. Linear interpolation curves between the unrelaxed\nand relaxed defect structures also showed good agreement between the two\nclasses of methods opening up the possibilities of using extended nanoflakes\nfor multistate investigations at DFT level.\n", "  In this contribution I discuss recent and ongoing progress on the inclusion\nof resummation effects in the fit of parton distributions.\n", "  Aggregation of nanoparticles of given size $R$ induced by addition of a\npolymer strongly depends on its degree of rigidity. This is shown here on a\nlarge variety of silica nanoparticle self-assemblies obtained by electrostatic\ncomplexation with carefully selected oppositely charged bio-polyelectrolytes of\ndifferent rigidity. The effective rigidity is quantified by the total\npersistence length $L_T$ representing the sum of the intrinsic ($L_p$) and\nelectrostatic ($L_e$) polyelectrolyte persistence length, which depends on the\nscreening, i.e., on ionic strength due to counter-ions and external salt\nconcentrations. We experimentally show for the first time that the ratio L T /R\nis the main tuning parameter that controls the fractal dimension D f of the\nnanoparticles self-assemblies, which is determined using small-angle neutron\nscattering: (i) For $L_T /R<0.3$ (obtained with flexible poly-L-lysine in the\npresence of an excess of salt), chain flexibility promotes easy wrapping around\nnanoparticles in excess hence ramified structures with $D_f \\sim 2$. (ii) For\n$0.3<L_T /R\\le1$ (semiflexible chitosan or hyaluronan complexes), chain\nstiffness promotes the formation of one-dimensional nanorods (in excess of\nnanoparticles), in good agreement with computer simulations. (iii) For $L_T\n/R>1$, $L_e$ is strongly increased due to the absence of salt and repulsions\nbetween nanoparticles cannot be compensated by the polyelectrolyte wrapping,\nwhich allow a spacing between nanoparticles and the formation of one\ndimensional pearl necklace complexes. (iv) Finally, electrostatic 2 screening,\ni.e. ionic strength, turned out to be a reliable way of controlling $D_f$ and\nthe phase diagram behavior. It finely tunes the short-range interparticle\npotential, resulting in larger fractal dimensions at higher ionic strength.\n", "  In this didactic article we explore the concept of quantum correlations\nbeyond entanglement. We begin by introducing and motivating the classically\ncorrelated states and then showing how to quantify the quantum correlations\nusing an entropic approach, arriving at a well known measure called the quantum\ndiscord. Quantum correlations and discord are then operationally linked with\nthe task of local broadcasting. We conclude by providing some alternative\nperspectives on quantum correlations and how to measure them.\n", "  We calculate semileptonic form factors for the decays $B_c \\to \\eta_c \\, l\n\\nu$ and $B_c \\to J/\\psi \\, l \\nu$ over the entire $q^2$ range, using a highly\nimproved lattice quark action for charm at several lattice spacings down to\n$a=0.045$ fm. We have two ways of treating the $b$ quark: either with an\n$O(\\alpha_s)$ improved NRQCD formalism or by extrapolating a heavy mass $m_h$\nto $m_b$ in the relativistic formalism. Comparison of the two approaches\nprovides an important cross-check of methodologies in lattice QCD.\nNonperturbative renormalisation of the currents in the relativistic theory also\nallows us then to fix NRQCD-charm normalisation for $b$ to $c$ decays such as\n$B \\to D$ and $B \\to D^*$.\n", "  Second law of thermodynamics can be apparently violated for systems whose\ndynamics depends on acquired information by measurement. However, when one\nconsider measurement and erasure process together along with the system it\nsaves the second law. We consider a simple example of information machine where\ninformation is used as a resource to increase its performance. The system is\nconnected to two baths, a work source and a moving tape which is used as an\ninformation reservoir. The performance of the device is autonomous. The system\nacts as an engine, erasure or refrigerator. Even combination of any two is\npossible. All these possibilities are allowed by generalized second law.\n", "  In this paper we present tabulated data for\nmagnetic-dipole-to-electric-quadrupole cross-susceptibilities\n($\\chi_{\\textrm{M}1 \\to \\textrm{E}2}$) for Dirac one-electron atoms with a\npointlike, spinless and motionless nucleus of charge $Ze$. Numerical values of\nthis susceptibility for the hydrogen atom ($Z=1$) and for hydrogenic ions with\n$2 \\leqslant Z \\leqslant 137$ are computed from the general analytical formula,\nrecently derived by us [P. Stefa{\\'n}ska, Phys. Rev. A 93 (2016) 022504], valid\nfor an arbitrary discrete energy eigenstate. In this work we provide 30 tables\nwith the values of $\\chi_{\\textrm{M}1 \\to \\textrm{E}2}$ for the ground state,\nand also for the first, the second and the third set of excited states (i.e.:\n2s$_{1/2}$, 2p$_{1/2}$, 2p$_{3/2}$, 3s$_{1/2}$, 3p$_{1/2}$, 3p$_{3/2}$,\n3d$_{3/2}$, 3d$_{5/2}$, 4s$_{1/2}$, 4p$_{1/2}$, 4p$_{3/2}$, 4d$_{3/2}$,\n4d$_{5/2}$, 4f$_{5/2}$ and 4f$_{7/2}$) of the relativistic hydrogenlike atoms.\nThe value of the inverse of the fine-structure constant used in the\ncalculations is $\\alpha^{-1}=137.035 \\: 999 \\: 139$, and was taken from CODATA\n2014.\n", "  The mechanism of transition from laminar state to turbulent state in\nKeplerian disks is still unknown. The most popular version today is generation\nof turbulence due to magnetorotational instability (MRI). However\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations give the value of Shakura-Sunyaev parameter\nmore then an order of magnitude smaller rather than that found from\nobservations. One way to solve this problem is the existence of an alternative\nor additional mechanism for generating turbulence. It can be the bypass\nmechanism, which is responsible for transition to turbulence in Couette and\nPoiseuille flows. This mechanism is based on the transient growth of linear\nperturbations in the flow with the subsequent transition to the nonlinear\nstage. In order to clarify the role of this mechanism in astrophysical disks\nfirst of all it is necessary to calculate the maximal possible growth factor of\nlinear perturbations in the flow. In this paper the results of such\ncalculations are presented for perturbations on different scales compared with\nthe disk thickness. Qualitative description of mechanisms responsible for the\ngrowth will also be presented. It was found that the most rapidly growing shear\nharmonics have azimuthal wavelength of the order of the disk thickness. In\naddition, their initial form is always similar to the vortex perturbations with\nthe same potential vorticity. It was shown that the vortices with azimuthal\nwavelength more than an order of magnitude in excess of the disc thickness, are\nstill able to grow by dozens of times.\n", "  SU(2) with N_f = 6 and N_f = 8 are believed to have an infrared conformal\nfixed point. We use the spectral density method cross referenced with the mass\nstep scaling method to evaluate the coupling constant dependence of the mass\nanomalous dimension for massless HEX smeared, clover improved Wilson fermions\nwith Schr\\\"odinger functional boundary conditions.\n", "  The modern cosmology is based on inflationary models with baryosynthesis and\ndark matter/energy.It implies extension of particle symmetry beyond the\nStandard model. Studies of physical basis of the modern cosmology combine\ndirect searches for new physics at accelerators with its indirect\nnon-accelerator probes, in which cosmological consequences of particle models\nplay important role. The cosmological consequences of particle models\ninevitably go beyond the 'standard' cosmological $\\Lambda$CDM model and some\npossible feature of such 'nonstandard'cosmological scenarios is the subject of\nthe present brief review.\n", "  We study generation and dynamics of an exchange spin qubit encoded in three\ncoherently coupled quantum dots with three electrons. For two geometries of the\nsystem a linear and a triangular one, the creation and coherent control of the\nqubit states are performed by the Landau--Zener transitions. In the triangular\ncase both the qubit states are equivalent and can be easily generated for\nparticular symmetries of the system. If one of the dots is smaller than the\nothers one can observe Rabi oscillations, that can be used for coherent\nmanipulation of the qubit states. The linear system is easier to fabricate;\nhowever, then the qubit states are not equivalent, making qubit operations more\ndifficult to control.\n", "  The elements of the E\\\"otv\\\"os matrix are useful for various geodetic\napplications, such as the interpolation of the elements of the deflection of\nthe vertical, the determination of gravity anomalies and the determination of\ngeoid heights. A torsion balance instrument is customarily used for the\ndetermination of the E\\\"otv\\\"os components. In this work, we show that it is\npossible to estimate the E\\\"otv\\\"os components, at a point on the physical\nsurface of the Earth, using gravity measurements at three nearby points,\ncomprising a very small network. In the first part, we present the method in\ndetail, while in the second part we demonstrate a numerical example. We\nconclude that this method is able to estimate the elements of the E\\\"otv\\\"os\nmatrix with satisfactory accuracy.\n", "  Lattice QCD is making good progress toward calculating the structure and\nproperties of light nuclei and the forces between nucleons. These calculations\nwill ultimately refine the nuclear forces, particularly in the three- and\nfour-nucleon sector and the short-distance interactions of nucleons with\nelectroweak currents, and allow for a reduction of uncertainties in nuclear\nmany-body calculations of nuclei and their reactions. After highlighting their\nimportance, particularly to the Nuclear Physics and High-Energy Physics\nexperimental programs, I discuss the progress that has been made toward\nachieving these goals and the challenges that remain.\n", "  The single scattering theory is applied to spin noise spectroscopy (SNS). The\ncase of two Gaussian probe beams tilted with respect to each other is analysed.\nIt is shown that SNS signal in this case carry information about spatial\ncorrelations of studied gyrotropic medium.\n", "  In the literature the $CPT$ theorem has only been established for\nHamiltonians that are Hermitian. Here we extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum\nfield theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a\nnon-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive,\nghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal\ngravity. Since our approach allows for complex energies and decays, our work\njustifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the\nlifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. In\nthe quantum-mechanical limit where charge conjugation is separately conserved,\nthe key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are\nrecovered.\n", "  The quest for the particle nature of dark matter is one of the big open\nquestions of modern physics. A well motivated candidate for dark matter is the\nso-called WIMP - a weakly interacting massive particle. Recently several\ntheoretically well-motivated models with dark matter candidates in a mass\nregion below the WIMP mass-scale gained also a lot of interest, theoretically\nand experimentally. The CRESST II experiment located at the Gran Sasso\nlaboratory in Italy is optimised for the detection of the elastic scattering of\nthese low-mass dark matter particles with ordinary matter. We show the results\nobtained with an improved detector setup with increased radio purity and\nenhanced background rejection and the results obtained with a dedicated\nlow-threshold analysis of a single conventional detector module. The limit\nachieved is the most stringent limit achieved for direct dark matter\nexperiments in the mass region below 1.8 GeV/$c^{2}$. We will discuss the\nexpected performance for new small CRESST-type detectors to be used during the\nnext data taking phase. We conclude with an outlook of the future potential for\ndirect dark matter detection using further improved CRESST CaWO$_{4}$ cryogenic\ndetectors.\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments on the dynamics of particles and polymers in\nartificial cytoskeletons and in cells, we introduce a modified Langevin\nequation for a particle in an environment that is a viscoelastic medium and\nthat is brought out of equilibrium by the action of active fluctuations caused\nby molecular motors. We show that within such a model, the motion of a free\nparticle crosses over from superdiffusive to subdiffusive as observed for\ntracer particles in an {\\it in vitro} cytoskeleton or in a cell. We investigate\nthe dynamics of a particle confined by a harmonic potential as a simple model\nfor the motion of the tethered head of kinesin-1. We find that the probability\nthat the head is close to its binding site on the microtubule can be enhanced\nby a factor of two due to active forces. Finally, we study the dynamics of a\nparticle in a double well potential as a model for the dynamics of\nDNA-hairpins. We show that the active forces effectively lower the potential\nbarrier between the two minima and study the impact of this phenomenon on the\nzipping/unzipping rate.\n", "  The effect of gamma irradiation on the UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy of\npolymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) foils has been studied. A new absorption band is\nobserved in the visible spectral range due to color centers induced in the\ngamma irradiated PMMA. This band shows maximum absorption (low transmission)\nfor 10 kGy irradiation, which decreases and saturates after 50 kGy followed by\na further increase at 500 kGy. The FTIR peaks show an increased absorption up\nto ~100 kGy irradiation, which reverses for higher doses. Broad band absorption\nis observed in FTIR spectra around 1600 and 3600 cm-1 due to absorption of\nmoisture in the irradiated samples. The reduction in the absorption intensity\nat 1718 cm-1 in the irradiated PMMA (> 100 kGy) is found associated with the\ndemerization of the carbonyl groups. An initial increase in the absorption of\nFTIR peaks with increase in the doses of irradiation is due to increased cross\nlinking in the PMMA structure that is induced by the absorption of moisture.\nThe demerization of carbonyl groups becomes dominant at higher doses of\nirradiation (~500 kGy).\n", "  Schwarzschild black hole is the simplest black hole that is studied most in\ndetail. Its behavior is best understood by looking at the geodesics of the\nparticles under the influence of its gravitational field. In this paper, the\nfocus of attention is giving a perspicuous description of the Schwarzschild\ngeodesics by using analogue potential approach. Specifically we discuss\ngeodesics of light and of a massive particle in the case that their angular\nmomentum is non zero in the Schwarzschild spacetime. This discussion is done by\ndefining analogue potentials out of geodesic equations and defining relevant\ndimensionless conserved quantities. Then, we designate how geodesics change in\nresponse to the change of these quantities. Our results indicate the relation\nbetween the particles' motion near black hole horizon and their angular\nmomentum. Furthermore, we make a comparison between Newtonian Physics (NP) and\nGeneral Relativity (GR) in the language of the analogue potential approach.\n", "  We investigate the collective behavior of self-propelled particles (SPPs)\nundergoing competitive processes of pattern formation and rotational relaxation\nof their self-propulsion velocities. In full accordance with previous work, we\nobserve transitions between different steady states of the SPPs caused by the\nintricate interplay among the involved effects of pattern formation,\norientational order, and coupling between the SPP density and orientation\nfields. Based on rigorous analytical and numerical calculations, we prove that\nthe rate of the orientational relaxation of the SPP velocity field is the main\nfactor determining the steady states of the SPP system. Further, we determine\nthe boundaries between domains in the parameter plane that delineate\nqualitatively different resting and moving states. In addition, we analytically\ncalculate the collective velocity $\\vec{v}$ of the SPPs and show that it\nperfectly agrees with our numerical results. We quantitatively demonstrate that\n$\\vec{v}$ does not vanish upon approaching the transition boundary between the\nmoving pattern and homogeneous steady states.\n", "  The microscopic orientation and position of photoactive molecules is crucial\nto the operation of optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs and solar cells. Here,\nwe introduce a shape-persistent macrocyclic molecule as an excellent\nfluorescent probe to simply measure (i) its orientation by rotating the\nexcitation polarization and recording the strength of modulation in\nphotoluminescence (PL), and (ii) its position in a film by analyzing the\noverall PL brightness at the molecular level. The unique shape, the absorption\nand the fluorescence properties of this probe yields information on molecular\norientation and position. We control orientation and positioning of the probe\nin a polymer film by solvent vapor annealing (SVA). During the SVA process the\nmolecules accumulate at the polymer/air interface, where they adopt a flat\nconformation, much like water lilies on the surface of a pond. The results are\nsignificant for OLED fabrication and single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) in\ngeneral.\n", "  Writing optical waveguides with femtosecond laser pulses provides the\ncapability of forming three-dimensional photonic circuits for manipulating\nlight fields in both linear and nonlinear manners. To fully explore this\npotential, large depths of the buried waveguides in transparent substrates are\noften desirable to facilitate achieving vertical integration of waveguides in a\nmulti-layer configuration, which, however, is hampered by rapidly degraded\naxial resolution caused by optical aberration. Here, we show that with the\ncorrection of the spherical aberration, polarization-independent waveguides can\nbe inscribed in a nonlinear optical crystal lithium niobate (LN) at depths up\nto 1.4 mm, which is more than one order of magnitude deeper than the waveguides\nwritten with aberration uncorrected femtosecond laser pulses. Our technique is\nbeneficial for applications ranging from miniaturized nonlinear light sources\nto quantum information processing.\n", "  Quantum interference (QI) effects in molecular systems are a topic of\nemerging interest in electron transport studies of single molecule junctions.\nIn a recent Letter, Xia et al. employed a graphical scheme introduced by my\ncolleagues and myself that enables to distinguish between molecular topologies\nin conjugated pi systems which exhibit QI effects in their conductance from\nthose who do not. They claimed that this scheme is not applicable for\nnonalternant hydrocarbons, in particular Azulenes (Az), whose transport\nproperties were studied both theoretically and experimentally by connecting the\nelectrodes at Az's 1,3-, 2,6-, 4,7-, and 5,7-positions, respectively. An\napparent disagreement has been identified between the predictions of our scheme\nreferred to as \"atom- or bond-counting model\" and theoretical simulations for\nfeatureless, wide band electrodes in the GW approximation as well as for the\ntight-binding (TB) model our method was originally derived from.\n  In the following I would like to clarify that this apparent disagreement\nvanishes if the graphical scheme is applied correctly, providing a different\nresult for the 1,3 Az compound than claimed by Xia et al. It will further be\nargued that the graphical scheme is completely general for any molecular\ntopology in conjugated pi systems regardless of whether they are alternant or\nnon-alternant hydrocarbons as long as the basic assumptions of its derivation\nare fulfilled.\n", "  Hydrogen bond (H-bond) covalency has recently been observed in ice and liquid\nwater, while the penetrating molecular orbitals (MOs) in the H-bond region of\nmost typical water dimer system, (H2O)2, have also been discovered. However,\nobtaining the quantitative contribution of these MOs to the H-bond interaction\nis still problematic. In this work, we introduced the orbital-resolved electron\ndensity projected integral (EDPI) along the H-bond to approach this problem.\nThe calculations show that, surprisingly, the electronic occupied orbital\n(HOMO-4) of (H2O)2 accounts for about 40% of the electron density at the bond\ncritical point. Moreover, the charge transfer analysis visualizes the electron\naccumulating effect of the orbital interaction within the H-bond between water\nmolecules, supporting its covalent-like character. Our work expands the\nclassical understanding of H-bond with specific contributions from certain MOs,\nand will also advance further research into such covalency and offer\nquantitative electronic structure insights into intermolecular systems.\n", "  We have done a spectroscopical analysis of the type I planetary nebula (PN)\nNGC 5315, through high-resolution (R$\\sim$40000) optical spectroscopy with UVES\nat the 8.2m Very Large Telescope, and medium-resolution (R$\\sim$4800) near-IR\nspectroscopy with FIRE at the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope, covering a wide\nspectral range from 0.31 $\\mu$m to 2.50 $\\mu$m. The main aim of this work is to\ninvestigate the slow neutron(n)-capture process (the s-process) in the\nAsymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star progenitor of a type I PNe. We detected and\nidentified about 700 features, including lines from the n-capture elements Kr,\nSe, and possibly Br and Xe. We compute physical conditions using line ratios of\ncommon ions. Ionic abundances are computed for the species with available\natomic data. We calculate total abundances using recent ionization correction\nfactors (ICFs) or by summing ionic abundances. Our results for common elements\nare in good agreement with previous works on the same object. We do not find a\nsubstantial s-process enrichment in NGC 5315, which is typical for type I PNe.\n", "  We briefly review recent results which we have obtained in the study of\nJ/psi-pair production at the Tevatron and the LHC. We claim that the existing\ndata set from CMS and D0 point at a significant double-parton-scattering\ncontribution with an effective cross section smaller than that for jet-related\nobservables. We have also derived simple relations involving feed-down\nfractions from excited states which can help in disentangling the single from\nthe double scatterings.\n", "  High levels of dust have been detected in the immediate vicinity of many\nstars, both young and old. A promising scenario to explain the presence of this\nshort-lived dust is that these analogues to the Zodiacal cloud (or exozodis)\nare refilled in situ through cometary activity and sublimation. As the\nreservoir of comets is not expected to be replenished, the presence of these\nexozodis in old systems has yet to be adequately explained.\n  It was recently suggested that mean-motion resonances (MMR) with exterior\nplanets on moderately eccentric ($\\mathrm{e_p}\\gtrsim 0.1$) orbits could\nscatter planetesimals on to cometary orbits with delays of the order of several\n100 Myr. Theoretically, this mechanism is also expected to sustain continuous\nproduction of active comets once it has started, potentially over\nGyr-timescales.\n  We aim here to investigate the ability of this mechanism to generate\nscattering on to cometary orbits compatible with the production of an exozodi\non long timescales. We combine analytical predictions and complementary\nnumerical N-body simulations to study its characteristics.\n  We show, using order of magnitude estimates, that via this mechanism, low\nmass discs comparable to the Kuiper Belt could sustain comet scattering at\nrates compatible with the presence of the exozodis which are detected around\nSolar-type stars, and on Gyr timescales. We also find that the levels of dust\ndetected around Vega could be sustained via our proposed mechanism if an\neccentric Jupiter-like planet were present exterior to the system's cold debris\ndisc.\n", "  We analytically study the effect of gravitational and harmonic forces on\nultra-cold atoms with synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In particular, we\nfocus on the recently observed transitions between internal states induced by\nacceleration of the external modes. Our description corresponds to a\ngeneralized version of the Landau-Zener (LZ) model: the dimensionality is\nenlarged to combine the quantum treatment of the external variables with the\ninternal-state characterization; additionally, atomic-interaction effects are\nconsidered. The emergence of the basic model is analytically traced. Namely, by\nusing a sequence of unitary transformations and a subsequent reduction to the\nspin space, the SOC Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated,\nis exactly converted into the primary LZ scenario. Moreover, the transitions\ninduced by harmonic acceleration are approximately cast into the framework of\nthe basic LZ model through a complete analytical procedure. We evaluate how the\nvalidity of our picture depends on the system preparation and on the magnitude\nof atomic-interaction effects. The identification of the regime of\napplicability and the rigorous characterization of the parameters of the\neffective model provide elements to control the transitions.\n", "  We discuss efficient algorithms for the accurate forward and reverse\nevaluation of the discrete Fourier-Bessel transform (dFBT) as numerical tools\nto assist in the 2D polar convolution of two radially symmetric functions,\nrelevant, e.g., to applications in computational biophotonics. In our survey of\nthe numerical procedure we account for the circumstance that the objective\nfunction might result from a more complex measurement process and is, in the\nworst case, known on a finite sequence of coordinate values, only. We contrast\nthe performance of the resulting algorithms with a procedure based on a\nstraight forward numerical quadrature of the underlying integral transform and\nasses its efficienty for two benchmark Fourier-Bessel pairs. An application to\nthe problem of finite-size beam-shape convolution in polar coordinates,\nrelevant in the context of tissue optics and optoacoustics, is used to\nillustrate the versatility and computational efficiency of the numerical\nprocedure.\n", "  We study heat transfer in plane Couette flow laden with rigid spherical\nparticles by means of direct numerical simulations using a direct-forcing\nimmersed boundary method to account for the dispersed phase. A volume of fluid\napproach is employed to solve the temperature field inside and outside of the\nparticles.\n  We focus on the variation of the heat transfer with the particle Reynolds\nnumber, total volume fraction (number of particles) and the ratio between the\nparticle and fluid thermal diffusivity, quantified in terms of an effective\nsuspension diffusivity. We show that, when inertia at the particle scale is\nnegligible, the heat transfer increases with respect to the unladen case\nfollowing an empirical correlation recently proposed. In addition, an average\ncomposite diffusivity can be used to predict the effective diffusivity of the\nsuspension the inertialess regime when varying the molecular diffusion in the\ntwo phases. At finite particle inertia, however, the heat transfer increase is\nsignificantly larger, saturating at higher volume fractions. By phase-ensemble\naveraging we identify the different mechanisms contributing to the total heat\ntransfer and show that the increase of the effective conductivity observed at\nfinite inertia is due to the increase of the transport associated to fluid and\nparticle velocity. We also show that the heat conduction in the solid phase\nreduces when increasing the particle Reynolds number and so that particles of\nlow thermal diffusivity weakly alter the total heat flux in the suspension at\nfinite particle Reynolds numbers. On the other hand, a higher particle thermal\ndiffusivity significantly increase the total heat transfer.\n", "  Motivated by the rapid destruction of antiferromagnetic long-range order in\nhole-doped cuprate high-temperature superconductors, we study the effect of\nskyrmions on the magnetic long-range order (MLRO). Here we assume that either a\nskyrmion or antiskyrmion is introduced by a doped hole. Our numerical\nsimulation indicates that in the case of isolated skyrmions, there is an abrupt\ndisappearance of MLRO for doping concentration $x < 1.0\\times 10^{-4}$. In the\ncase of skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs, the critical doping concentration $x_c$\nfor the suppression of MLRO is given as a function of the separation of the\npairs. For a moderate separation of $3 - 4$ lattice constants, we find that the\ncritical doping is consistent with the experimental value.\n", "  While the formalism of isolated horizons is known for some time, only quite\nrecently the near horizon solution of Einstein's equations has been found in\nthe Bondi-like coordinates by Krishnan in 2012. In this framework, the\nspace-time is regarded as the characteristic initial value problem with the\ninitial data given on the horizon and another null hypersurface. It is not\nclear, however, what initial data reproduce the simplest physically relevant\nblack hole solution, namely that of Kerr-Newman which describes stationary,\naxisymmetric black hole with charge. Moreover, Krishnan's construction employs\nthe non-twisting null geodesic congruence and the tetrad which is parallelly\npropagated along this congruence. While the existence of such tetrad can be\neasily established in general, its explicit form can be very difficult to find\nand, in fact it has not been provided for the Kerr-Newman metric. The goal of\nthis thesis was to fill this gap and provide a full description of the\nKerr-Newman metric in the framework of isolated horizons. In the theoretical\npart of the thesis we review the spinor and Newman-Penrose formalism, basic\ngeometry of isolated horizons and then present our results. Thesis is\ncomplemented by several appendices.\n", "  Ultrasonic agitation is a proven method for breaking down layered materials\nsuch as MoS2 into single or few layer nanoparticles. In this experiment, MoS2\npowder is sonicated in isopropanol for an extended period of time in an attempt\nto create particles of the smallest possible size. As expected, the process\nyielded a significant quantity of nanoscale MoS2 in the form of finite layer\nsheets with lateral dimensions as small as a few tens of nanometers. Although\nno evidence was found to indicate a larger the longer sonication times resulted\nin a significant increase in yield of single layer MoS2, the increased\nsonication did result in the formation of several types of carbon allotropes in\naddition to the sheets of MoS2. These carbon structures appear to originate\nfrom the breakdown of the isopropanol and consist of finite layer graphite\nplatelets as well as a large number of multi-walled fullerenes, also known as\ncarbon onions. Both the finite layer graphite and MoS2 nanoplatelets were both\nfound to be heavily decorated with carbon onions. However, isolated clusters of\ncarbon onions could also be found. Our results show that liquid exfoliation of\nMoS2 is not only useful for forming finite layer MoS2, but also creating carbon\nonions at room temperature as well.\n", "  The electrostatic pull-in instability (EPI), within the framework of the\nnanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) has been shown as a robust and versatile\nmethod for characterizing mechanical properties of nanocantilevers. This paper\naims to investigate the surface effects, specifically residual surface stress\nand surface elasticity, on the EPI of micro and nano-scale cantilevers as well\nas double clamped beams. Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no\nresidual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or\nintrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small\ndeformation. The strain-dependent component of the surface stress or surface\nelasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently,\ninduces shifts in the EPI. For double clamped beams, the effective residual\nsurface stress comes into play and modifies the effective residual stress of\nthe beam. The nonlinear electromechanical coupled equations, which take into\naccount the surface effects are solved numerically. The theoretical results\npresented in this paper indicate that the EPI is very sensitive to the surface\neffects, especially when a double clamped beam is employed. The results show\nthat the influence of surface effects on the EPI of cantilevers become more\nprofound when the thickness is below 50 nm, while the influence on double\nclamped beams is significant even at sub-micron scale. The present study can\nprovide helpful insights for the design and characterization of NEMS switches.\nMoreover, the results can be used to provide the proof of concepts of a new\nsurface stress sensing method using EPI in nanomechanical sensor systems.\n", "  We remind the way to obtain integrable models with non-minimally coupled\nscalar fields. We are interesting to models with bounce solutions and compare\nbounce solutions in two known integrable models. We show that only one model\nhas a bounce solution that tends to a stable de Sitter solution.\n", "  The possibility of strange stars mixed with dark energy to be one of\ncandidates for dark energy stars is the main issue of the present study. Our\ninvestigation shows that quark matter is acting as dark energy after certain\nyet unknown critical condition inside the quark stars. Our proposed model\nreveals that strange stars mixed with dark energy feature not only a physically\nacceptable stable model but also mimic characteristics of dark energy stars.\nThe plausible connections are shown through the mass-radius relation as well as\nthe entropy and temperature. We particulary note that two-fluid distribution is\nthe major reason for anisotropic nature of the spherical stellar system.\n", "  Laser frequency combs based on erbium-doped fiber mode-locked lasers have\nshown great potential for compact, robust and efficient optical clock\ncomparisons. However, to simultaneously compare multiple optical clock species,\nfiber laser frequency combs typically require multiple amplifiers and fiber\noptic paths that reduce the achievable frequency stability near 1 part in\n$10^{16}$ at 1s. In this paper we describe an erbium-fiber laser frequency comb\nthat overcomes these conventional challenges and supports optical frequency\nsynthesis at the millihertz level, or fractionally $3 x 10^{-18}$ $tau^{-1/2}$\nby ensuring that all critical fiber paths are within the servo-controlled\nfeedback loop. We demonstrate the application of this frequency comb as a\nsynthesizer for optical clocks operating across a wavelength range from 650 nm\nto 2100 nm.\n", "  We study representation theory of Drinfel'd twists, in terms of what we call\nF matrices, associated to finite dimensional irreducible modules of quantum\naffine algebras, and which factorize the corresponding (unitary) R matrices. We\nconstruct explicitly such factorizing F matrices for irreducible tensor\nproducts of the fundamental representations of the quantum affine algebra sl2\nand its associated Yangian. We then apply these constructions to the XXX and\nXXZ quantum spins chains of finite length in the framework of the Algebraic\nBethe Ansatz.\n"]}
