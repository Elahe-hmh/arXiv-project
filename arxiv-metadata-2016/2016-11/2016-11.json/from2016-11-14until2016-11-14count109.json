For systems comprising a small to medium number of atoms\n(or qubits), the non-truncated equations are usually solved numerically. In\nthis paper, we present a group-theoretical superoperator method that helps\nsolving these equations. To do so, we exploit the SU(4)-symmetry of the\nrespective Lindblad operator and construct basis states that generalize the\nwell-known Dicke states. This allows us to solve various problems analytically\nand to considerably reduce the complexity of problems that can only be solved\nnumerically. Finally, we present three examples that illustrate the proposed\nmethod.\n", "  We study the stability of a non-Abelian chromomagnetic vacuum in Yang-Mills\ntheory in Euclidean Einstein universe $S^1\\times S^3$. We assume that the gauge\ngroup is a simple compact group $G$ containing the group SU(2) as a subgroup\nand consider static covariantly constant gauge fields on $S^3$ taking values in\nthe adjoint representation of the group $G$ and forming a representation of the\ngroup $SU(2)$. We compute the heat kernel for the Laplacian acting on fields on\n$S^3$ in an arbitrary representation of SU(2) and use this result to compute\nthe heat kernels for the gluon and the ghost operators and the one-loop\neffective action. We show that the only configuration of the covariantly\nconstant Yang-Mills background that is stable is the one that contains only\nspinor (fundamental) representations of the group SU(2); all other\nconfigurations contain negative modes and are unstable. For the stable\nconfiguration we compute the asymptotics of the effective action, the energy\ndensity, the entropy and the heat capacity in the limits of low/high\ntemperature and small/large volume and show that the energy density has a\nnon-trivial minimum at a finite value of the radius of the sphere $S^3$.\n", "  We report on the mixed-orbital ground state compounds analogous to the\nmixed-valence ones. Orbital doublet and singlet ground states of the Fe2+ ion\ndisplayed in Moessbauer spectra of the Prussian blue analogues\nAyFe3-y[Co(CN)6]2xH2O (y<1) are interconverting to each other as temperature\nchanges for A = K, Na. Relative weight of orbital singlet ground states\nincreases with lowering temperature. In the alcali-free cobalticyanides, the\nMoessbauer spectra are dominated by quadrupole-splt doublets of the same origin\nwith a large splitting characteristic of the Fe2+ species coordinated by two\n(at least) oxygen atoms of water molecules in cis-configuration. Single type\noctahedral coordination of Fe2+ is isolated in A-filled cobalticyanides for\nA=Rb, Cs to be characterized by the narrower quadrupole spectrum associated\nwith the orbital doublet ground states. Ionic exchange of K for Cs in\nKFe[Co(CN)6]H2O results in predominance of the orbital singlet, i.e., in\nenhanced anisotropy of the Fe2+ valence electrons. We found hence that the Fe2+\ncharge distribution can be modified together with crystal size at the step of\nsynthesis owing to distortion isomerism.\n", "  In the present article we investigate the efficacy of Dzyaloshisnhkii-Moriya\n(DM) interaction to convert the bound entangled states into free entangled\nstates. Here we consider the tripartite hybrid system as a pair of non\ninteracting two qutrits initially prepared in bound entangled states and one\nauxiliary qubit. The auxiliary qubit interacts with any one of the qutrit of\nthe pair through DM interaction. It has been found that the DM interaction free\nthe bound entangled states as time advances. In the present work we consider\ntwo types of bound entangled states investigated by Horodecki. Further we find\nthat the frequency of free entanglement conversion is same in both the states.\nWe also investigate the phenomenon of entanglement and distillability sudden\ndeath and their possibilities. Here the realignment criteria and negativity\nhave been used for detection and quantification of entanglement.\n", "  We extend the work of Oppenheimer & Synder to model the gravitational\ncollapse of a star to a black hole by including quantum mechanical effects. We\nfirst derive closed-form solutions for classical paths followed by a particle\non the surface of the collapsing star in Schwarzschild and Kruskal coordinates\nfor space-like, time-like and light-like geodesics. We next present an\napplication of these paths to model the collapse of ultra-light dark matter\nparticles, which necessitates incorporating quantum effects. To do so we treat\na particle on the surface of the star as a wavepacket and integrate over all\npossible paths taken by the particle. The waveform is computed in Schwarzschild\ncoordinates and found to exhibit an ingoing and an outgoing component, where\nthe former contains the probability of collapse, while the latter contains the\nprobability that the star will disperse. These calculations pave the way for\ninvestigating the possibility of quantum collapse that does not lead to black\nhole formation as well as for exploring the nature of the wavefunction inside\nr=2M.\n", "  This paper presents a study of the ISW effect from the Planck 2015\ntemperature and polarization data release. The CMB is cross-correlated with\ndifferent LSS tracers: the NVSS, SDSS and WISE catalogues, and the Planck 2015\nlensing map. This cross-correlation yields a detection at $4\\,\\sigma$, where\nmost of the signal-to-noise is due to the Planck lensing and NVSS. In fact, the\nISW effect is detected only from the Planck data (through the ISW-lensing\nbispectrum) at $\\approx 3\\,\\sigma$, which is similar to the detection level\nachieved by combining the cross-correlation signal coming from all the\ncatalogues. The ISW signal allow us to detect $\\Omega_\\Lambda$ at more than\n$3\\,\\sigma$. This cross-correlation analysis is performed only with the Planck\ntemperature data, since the polarization scales available in the 2015 release\ndo not permit significant improvement of the CMB-LSS cross-correlation\ndetectability. Nevertheless, polarization data is used to study the anomalously\nlarge ISW signal previously reported through the stacking of CMB features at\nthe locations of known superstructures. We find that the current Planck\npolarization data do not exclude that this signal could be caused by the ISW\neffect. In addition, the stacking of the Planck lensing map on the locations of\nsuperstructures exhibits a positive cross-correlation with these large-scale\nstructures. Finally, we have improved our previous reconstruction of the ISW\ntemperature fluctuations by combining the information encoded in all the\npreviously mentioned LSS tracers. In particular, we construct a map of the ISW\nsecondary anisotropies and the corresponding uncertainties map, obtained from\nsimulations. We also explore the reconstruction of the ISW anisotropies caused\nby the LSS traced by the 2MPZ survey by directly inverting the density field\ninto the gravitational potential field.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations between trigger particles in the forward\npseudorapidity range ($2.5 < |\\eta| < 4.0$) and associated particles in the\ncentral range ($|\\eta| < 1.0$) are measured with the ALICE detector in p-Pb\ncollisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The trigger\nparticles are reconstructed using the muon spectrometer, and the associated\nparticles by the central barrel tracking detectors. In high-multiplicity\nevents, the double-ridge structure, previously discovered in two-particle\nangular correlations at midrapidity, is found to persist to the pseudorapidity\nranges studied in this Letter. The second-order Fourier coefficients for muons\nin high-multiplicity events are extracted after jet-like correlations from\nlow-multiplicity events have been subtracted. The coefficients are found to\nhave a similar transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) dependence in p-going (p-Pb)\nand Pb-going (Pb-p) configurations, with the Pb-going coefficients larger by\nabout $16\\pm6$%, rather independent of $p_{\\rm T}$ within the uncertainties of\nthe measurement. The data are compared with calculations using the AMPT model,\nwhich predicts a different $p_{\\rm T}$ and $\\eta$ dependence than observed in\nthe data. The results are sensitive to the parent particle $v_2$ and\ncomposition of reconstructed muon tracks, where the contribution from heavy\nflavour decays are expected to dominate at $p_{\\rm T}>2$ GeV/$c$.\n", "  The paper aims to provide an explanation for the tiny value of the\ncosmological constant and the low vacuum energy density to represent the dark\nenergy. To accomplish this, we will search for a fundamental principle of\nsymmetry in space-time by means of the elimination of the classical idea of\nrest, by including an invariant minimum limit of speed in the subatomic world.\nSuch a minimum speed, unattainable by particles, represents a preferred\nreference frame associated with a background field that breaks down the Lorentz\nsymmetry. The metric of the flat space-time shall include the presence of a\nuniform vacuum energy density, which leads to a negative pressure at\ncosmological length scales. Thus, the equation of state for the cosmological\nconstant [$p$(pressure)$=- \\epsilon$ (energy density)] naturally emerges from\nsuch a space-time with an energy barrier of a minimum speed. The tiny values of\nthe cosmological constant and the vacuum energy density will be successfully\nobtained, being in agreement with the observational results of Perlmutter,\nSchmidt and Riess.\n", "  In this paper, we apply ideas of Dijkgraaf and Witten on 2+1 dimensional\ntopological quantum field theory to arithmetic curves, that is, the spectra of\nrings of integers in algebraic number fields. In the first three sections, we\ndefine classical Chern-Simons functionals on spaces of Galois representations.\nIn the highly speculative section 5, we consider the far-fetched possibility of\nusing Chern-Simons theory to construct L-functions.\n", "  A phase transition to quark matter can lead to interesting phenomenological\nconsequences in core-collapse supernovae, e.g., triggering an explosion in\nspherically symmetric models. However, until now this explosion mechanism was\nonly shown to be working for equations of state that are in contradiction with\nrecent pulsar mass measurements. Here, we identify that this explosion\nmechanism is related to the existence of a third family of compact stars. For\nthe equations of state investigated, the third family is only pronounced in the\nhot, early stages of the protocompact star and absent or negligibly small at\nzero temperature and thus represents a novel kind of third family. This\ninteresting behavior is a result of unusual thermal properties induced by the\nphase transition, e.g., characterized by a decrease of temperature with\nincreasing density for isentropes, and can be related to a negative slope of\nthe phase transition line in the temperature-pressure phase diagram.\n", "  In this paper, the width of the decay $\\tau \\rightarrow\nK^{-}\\pi^{0}\\nu_{\\tau}$ is calculated in the framework of the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The contributions of the intermediate vector\n$K^{*}(892)$ and scalar $K_{0}^{*}(800)$ mesons are taken into account. It is\nshown that the main contribution to the width of this decay is given by the\nsubprocesses with the intermediate $W$-boson and vector $K^{*}(892)$ meson. The\nscalar channel with the intermediate $K_{0}^{*}(800)$ meson gives an\ninsignificant contribution. In Appendix, it is shown that the contribution of\nthe subprocess with the intermediate ${K^{*}}'(1410)$ meson is negligible as\nwell. The obtained results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental\ndata.\n", "  With infrared ellipsometry we studied the response of the confined electrons\nin a $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures in which they originate\npredominantly from oxygen vacancies. From the analysis of a so-called Berreman\nmode, that develops near the highest longitudinal optical phonon mode of\nSrTiO$_3$, we derive the sheet carrier density, ${N_{s}}$, the mobility, $\\mu$,\nand also the depth profile of the carrier concentration. Notably, we find that\n${N_{s}}$ and the shape of the depth profile are similar as in\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures for which the itinerant carriers are\nbelieved to arise from a polar discontinuity. The main differences concern the\nhigher mobility and a relatively stronger confinement of the electrons in\n$\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$\n", "  Using holographic calculations, we examine a key assumption made in\nJacobson's recent argument for deriving Einstein's equations from vacuum\nentanglement entropy. Our results involving relevant operators with low\nconformal dimensions seem to conflict with Jacobson's assumption. However, we\ndiscuss ways to circumvent this problem.\n", "  A novel approach to investigate the electron transport of cis- and\ntrans-polyacetylene chains in the single-electron approximation is presented by\nusing microwave emulation measurements and tight-binding calculations. In the\nemulation we take into account the different electronic couplings due to the\ndouble bonds leading to coupled dimer chains. The relative coupling constants\nare adjusted by DFT calculations. For sufficiently long chains a transport band\ngap is observed if the double bonds are present, whereas for identical\ncouplings no band gap opens. The band gap can be observed also in relatively\nshort chains, if additional edge atoms are absent, which cause strong resonance\npeaks within the band gap. The experimental results are in agreement with our\ntight-binding calculations using the nonequilibrium Green's function method.\nThe tight-binding calculations show that it is crucial to include third nearest\nneighbor couplings to obtain the gap in the cis-polyacetylene.\n", "  The experimental results of Takaki et al. [1] on the stage I resistivity\nrecovery of electron irradiated iron are analyzed using the analytical theory\nof diffusion annealing formulated by Simpson & Sossin [2] and Schroeder [3]\ntaking into account the recent first-principles calculations of Fu et al. [4]\nregarding the mobility of interstitials. Excellent agreement between theory and\nexperiment is obtained by a minimal set of adjustable parameters. The results\nshow that the diffusion annealing equations can be successfully employed for\nthe analysis of recovery experiments in iron.\n", "  A recent computational result suggests that highly confined modes can be\nrealized by all-dielectric metamaterials (S. Jahani et. al., Optica 1, 96\n(2014)). This substantially decreases crosstalk between dielectric waveguides,\npaving the way for high-density photonic circuits. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate, on a standard silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, that using a\nsimple metamaterial between two silicon strip waveguides results in about a\n10-fold increase in coupling length. The proposed structure may lead to\nsignificant reduction in the size of devices in silicon photonics.\n", "  We propose a simple scheme for realizing the physics of 1D anyons with\nultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice. It relies on\nlattice-shaking-induced resonant tunneling against potential off-sets created\nby a combination of a lattice tilt and strong on-site interactions. No lasers\nadditional to those used for the creation of the optical lattice are required.\nWe also discuss experimental signatures of the continuous interpolation between\nbosons and fermions when the statistical angle $\\theta$ is varied from 0 to\n$\\pi$. Since the anyonic momentum distribution is not measurable in the bosonic\nrepresentation of the anyon model, we propose to use Friedel oscillations in\nsmall systems as an alternative probe.\n", "  We derive the self-energy functional theory for bosonic lattice systems with\nbroken $U(1)$ symmetry by parametrizing the bosonic Baym-Kadanoff effective\naction in terms of one- and two-point self-energies. The formalism goes beyond\nother approximate methods such as the pseudoparticle variational cluster\napproximation, the cluster composite boson mapping, and the Bogoliubov+U\ntheory. It simplifies to bosonic dynamical-mean field theory when constraining\nto local fields, whereas when neglecting kinetic contributions of non-condensed\nbosons it reduces to the static mean-field approximation. To benchmark the\ntheory we study the Bose-Hubbard model on the two- and three-dimensional cubic\nlattice, comparing with exact results from path integral quantum Monte Carlo.\nWe also study the frustrated square lattice with next-nearest neighbor hopping,\nwhich is beyond the reach of Monte Carlo simulations. A reference system\ncomprising a single bosonic state, corresponding to three variational\nparameters, is sufficient to quantitatively describe phase-boundaries, and\nthermodynamical observables, while qualitatively capturing the spectral\nfunctions, as well as the enhancement of kinetic fluctuations in the frustrated\ncase. On the basis of these findings we propose self-energy functional theory\nas the omnibus framework for treating bosonic lattice models, in particular, in\ncases where path integral quantum Monte Carlo methods suffer from severe sign\nproblems (e.g. in the presence of non-trivial gauge fields or frustration).\nSelf-energy functional theory enables the construction of diagrammatically\nsound approximations that are quantitatively precise and controlled in the\nnumber of optimization parameters, but nevertheless remain computable by modest\nmeans.\n", "  The full and differential widths of the decay $\\tau \\rightarrow\nK^{0}K^{-}\\nu_{\\tau}$ are calculated in the framework of the extended\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model. The contributions of the subprocesses with the\nintermediate vector mesons $\\rho$(770) and $\\rho$(1450) are taken into account.\nThe obtained results are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Spectro-seismic measurements of red giants enabled the recent discovery of\nstars in the thick disk that are more massive than 1.4 M_sun. While it has been\nclaimed that most of these stars are younger than the rest of the typical thick\ndisk stars, we show evidence that they might be products of mass transfer in\nbinary evolution, notably evolved blue stragglers. We took new measurements of\nthe radial velocities in a sample of 26 stars from APOKASC, including 13\n\"young\" stars and 13 \"old\" stars with similar stellar parameters but with\nmasses below 1.2 M_sun and found that more of the \"young\" stars appear to be in\nbinary systems with respect to the \"old\" stars. Furthermore, we show that the\n\"young\" stars do not follow the expected trend of [C/H] ratios versus mass for\nindividual stars. However, with a population synthesis of low-mass stars\nincluding binary evolution and mass transfer, we can reproduce the observed\n[C/N] ratios versus mass. Our study shows how asteroseismology of solar-type\nred giants provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of\nfield blue stragglers after they have left the main-sequence.\n", "  We review recent developments in nonlinear quantum transport through\nnanostructures and mesoscopic systems driven by thermal gradients or in\ncombination with voltage biases. Low-dimensional conductors are excellent\nplatforms to analyze both the thermoelectric and heat dynamics beyond linear\nresponse because due to their small size a small temperature difference applied\nacross regions gives rise to large thermal biases. We offer a theoretical\ndiscussion based on the scattering approach to highlight the differences\nbetween the linear and the nonlinear regimes of transport. We discuss recent\nexperiments on quantum dots and molecular junctions subjected to strong\ntemperature differences. Theoretical predictions concerning the Kondo effect\nand heat rectification proposals are briefly examined. An important issue is\nthe calculation of thermoelectric efficiencies including nonlinearities. Cross\nSeebeck effects and nonlinear spin filtering arise in superconductors and\ntopological insulators while mixed noises between charge and heat currents are\nalso considered. Finally, we provide an outlook on the possible future\ndirections of the field.\n", "  Topological states of matter, as quantum Hall systems or topological\ninsulators, cannot be distinguished from ordinary matter by local measurements\nin the bulk of the material. Instead, global measurements are required,\nrevealing topological invariants as the Chern number. At the heart of\ntopological materials are topologically protected edge states that occur at the\nintersection between regions of different topological order. Ultracold atomic\ngases in optical lattices are promising new platforms for topological states of\nmatter, though the observation of edge states has so far been restricted in\nthese systems to the state space imposed by the internal atomic structure. Here\nwe report on the observation of an edge state between two topological distinct\nphases of an atomic physics system in real space using optical microscopy. An\ninterface between two spatial regions of different topological order is\nrealized in a one-dimensional optical lattice of spatially chirped amplitude.\nTo reach this, a magnetic field gradient causes a spatial variation of the\nRaman detuning in an atomic rubidium three- level system and a corresponding\nspatial variation of the coupling between momentum eigenstates. This novel\nexperimental technique realizes a cold atom system described by a Dirac\nequation with an inhomogeneous mass term closely related to the SSH-model. The\nobserved edge state is characterized by measuring the overlap to various\ninitial states, revealing that this topological state has singlet nature in\ncontrast to the other system eigenstates, which occur pairwise. We also\ndetermine the size of the energy gap to the adjacent eigenstate doublet. Our\nfindings hold prospects for the spectroscopy of surface states in topological\nmatter and for the quantum simulation of interacting Dirac systems.\n", "  We investigate quantum phase transitions in a 2+1 dimensional gauge theory at\nfinite chemical potential $\\chi$ and magnetic field $B$. The gravity dual is\nbased on 4D $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Fayet-Iliopoulos gauged supergravity and the\nsolutions we consider---that are constructed analytically---are extremal,\ndyonic, asymptotically $AdS_4$ black-branes with a nontrivial radial profile\nfor the scalar field. We discover a line of second order fixed points at\n$B=B_c(\\chi)$ between the dyonic black brane and an extremal \"thermal gas\"\nsolution with a singularity of good-type, according to the acceptability\ncriteria of Gubser [1]. The dual field theory is the ABJM theory [2] deformed\nby a triple trace operator $\\Phi^3$ and placed at finite charge and magnetic\nfield. This line of fixed points might be useful in studying the various\nstrongly interacting quantum critical phenomena such as the ones proposed to\nunderlie the cuprate superconductors. We also find curious similarities between\nthe behaviour of the VeV $\\langle \\Phi \\rangle$ under B and that of the quark\ncondensate in 2+1 dimensional NJL models.\n", "  The quantum to classical transition maybe caused by decoherence or by\ndynamical collapse of the wave-function. We propose quantum discord as a tool,\n1) for comparing and contrasting the role of a collapse model (Continuous\nSpontaneous Localization) and various sources of decoherence (environmental and\nfundamental), 2) for detecting collapse model and fundamental decoherence for\nan experimentally demonstrated macroscopic entanglement. We discuss the\nexperimental times which will lead to the detection of either Continuous\nSpontaneous Localization or fundamental decoherence. We further put bounds on\nthe collapse parameters from this experiment for quantum discord.\n", "  A scheme for arbitrary quantum state engineering (QSE) in three-state systems\nis proposed. Firstly, starting from a set of complete orthogonal time-dependent\nbasis with undetermined coefficients, a time-dependent Hamiltonian is derived\nvia Counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an\narbitrary target state at a predefined time. Then, on request of the assumed\ntarget states, two single-mode driving protocols and a multi-mode driving\nprotocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the QSE scheme.\nThe result of comparison between single-mode driving and multi-mode driving\nshows that multi-mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application\nprospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target state from an\narbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of\nmicrowave fields for the transition between the two ground states. Moreover,\nfor the purpose of discussion in the scheme's feasibility in practice, a\npolynomial ansatz as the simplest exampleis used to fix the pulses. The result\nshows that the pulses designed to implement the protocols are not hard to be\nrealized in practice. At the end, QSE in higher-dimensional systems is also\ndiscussed in brief as a generalization example of the scheme.\n", "  In isotropic strain gradient elasticity, we decompose the strain gradient\ntensor into its irreducible pieces under the n-dimensional orthogonal group\nO(n). Using the Young tableau method for traceless tensors, four irreducible\npieces (n>2), which are canonical, are obtained. In three dimensions, the\nstrain gradient tensor can be decomposed into four irreducible pieces with\n7+5+3+3 independent components whereas in two dimensions, the strain gradient\ntensor can be decomposed into three irreducible pieces with 2+2+2 independent\ncomponents. The knowledge of these irreducible pieces is extremely useful when\nsetting up constitutive relations and strain energy.\n", "  Three thought experiments demonstrate that under certain circumstances\nelectromagnetic fields have to be attenuated or amplified multiplicatively in\norder not to violate the conservation of energy. Modulation of radiation by\nmeans other than superposition is theoretically made possible by plugging\nadditional terms into the source slots of the Maxwell equations. Thus modulated\nradiation would enable the well focused stimulation of neurons for diagnostic\nand therapeutic purposes and for HCI applications.\n", "  Statistical mechanics provides an effective framework to investigate\ninformation processing in biochemical reactions. Within such framework\nfar-reaching analogies are established among (anti-) cooperative collective\nbehaviors in chemical kinetics, (anti-)ferromagnetic spin models in statistical\nmechanics and operational amplifiers/flip-flops in cybernetics. The underlying\nmodeling -- based on spin systems -- has been proved to be accurate for a wide\nclass of systems matching classical (e.g. Michaelis--Menten, Hill, Adair)\nscenarios in the infinite-size approximation. However, the current research in\nbiochemical information processing has been focusing on systems involving a\nrelatively small number of units, where this approximation is no longer valid.\nHere we show that the whole statistical mechanical description of reaction\nkinetics can be re-formulated via a mechanical analogy -- based on completely\nintegrable hydrodynamic-type systems of PDEs -- which provides explicit\nfinite-size solutions, matching recently investigated phenomena (e.g.\nnoise-induced cooperativity, stochastic bi-stability, quorum sensing). The\nresulting picture, successfully tested against a broad spectrum of data,\nconstitutes a neat rationale for a numerically effective and theoretically\nconsistent description of collective behaviors in biochemical reactions.\n", "  Quantum considerations have led many theorists to believe that classical\nblack hole physics is modified not just deep inside black holes but at {\\it\nhorizon scales}, or even further outward. The near-horizon regime has just\nbegun to be observationally probed for astrophysical black holes -- both by\nLIGO, and by the Event Horizon Telescope. This suggests exciting prospects for\nobservational constraints on or discovery of new quantum black hole structure.\nThis paper overviews arguments for certain such structure and these prospects.\n", "  Higher-dimensional solutions for Einstein-Maxwell equations that generalize\nthe charged Nariai spacetime are obtained. The solutions presented here are\nmade from the direct product of several 2-spaces of constant curvature. These\nsolutions turn out to have many magnetic charges, contrary to the usual\nhigher-dimensional generalization of the Nariai spacetime, which has no\nmagnetic charge at all. These solutions are then used to generate black hole\nmetrics. Finally, it is analyzed how these generalized Nariai solutions are\nmodified in more general theories of gravity.\n", "  To measure the $R$ value in an energy scan experiment with $\\ee$ collisions,\nprecise calculation of initial state radiation is required in event generators.\nWe present an event generator for this consideration, which incorporates\ninitial state radiation effects up to the second order accuracy, and the\nradiative correction factor is calculated using the totally hadronic Born cross\nsection. The measured exclusive processes are generated according to their\ncross sections, while the unknown processes are generated using the LUND Area\nLaw model, and its parameters are tuned with data collected at $\\sqrt s=3.65$\nGeV. The optimized values are validated with data in the range $\\sqrt\ns=2.2324\\sim3.671$ GeV. These optimized parameters are universally valid for\nevent generation below the $D\\bar D$ threshold.\n", "  One of the key predictions of the WIMP paradigm for Dark Matter (DM) is that\nDM particles can annihilate into charged particles. These annihilations will\nproceed in e.g. Galactic subhalos such as dwarf Galaxies or, as recently\npointed out, high velocity clouds such as the \"Smith Cloud\". In this note, we\nfocus on the radio emission associated with DM annihilations into electrons and\npositrons occurring in the Smith Cloud. The phenomenology of this emission is\ndiscussed in quite some detail. We argue that the uncertainties in the\npropagation can be captured by the typical diffusion-loss length parameter\n(Syrovatskii variable) but that the angle-integrated radio fluxes are\nindependent of the propagation. We conclude that if the Smith Cloud is indeed\ndominated by DM, radio signals from DM annihilation stand out amongst other\nmessengers. Furthermore, low frequencies such as the ones observed by e.g. the\nLow Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the next-generation Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA) are optimal for searches for DM in the Smith Cloud. As a practical\napplication, we set conservative constraints on dark matter annihilation cross\nsection using data of continuum radio emission from the Galaxy at 22 MHz and at\n1.4 GHz. Stronger constraints could be reached by background subtraction,\nexploiting the profile and frequency dependence of the putative DM signal. We\nset stronger but tentative limits using the median noise in brightness\ntemperature from the Green Bank Telescope and the LOFAR sensitivities.\n", "  The EoR 21-cm signal is expected to become highly non-Gaussian as\nreionization progresses. This severely affects the error-covariance of the EoR\n21-cm power spectrum which is important for predicting the prospects of a\ndetection with ongoing and future experiments. Most earlier works have assumed\nthat the EoR 21-cm signal is a Gaussian random field where (1) the error\nvariance depends only on the power spectrum and the number of Fourier modes in\nthe particular $k$ bin, and (2) the errors in the different $k$ bins are\nuncorrelated. Here we use an ensemble of simulated 21-cm maps to analyze the\nerror-covariance at various stages of reionization. We find that even at the\nvery early stages of reionization ($\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} \\sim 0.9 $) the error\nvariance significantly exceeds the Gaussian predictions at small length-scales\n($k > 0.5 \\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$) while they are consistent at larger scales. The\nerrors in most $k$ bins (both large and small scales), are however found to be\ncorrelated. Considering the later stages ($\\bar{x}_{\\rm HI} = 0.15$), the error\nvariance shows an excess in all $k$ bins within $k \\ge 0.1 \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$,\nand it is around $200$ times larger than the Gaussian prediction at $k \\sim 1\n\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The errors in the different $k$ bins are all also highly\ncorrelated, barring the two smallest $k$ bins which are anti-correlated with\nthe other bins. Our results imply that the predictions for different 21-cm\nexperiments based on the Gaussian assumption underestimate the errors, and it\nis necessary to incorporate the non-Gaussianity for more realistic predictions.\n", "  We study the effects of the initial state radiation on the $s$-channel Higgs\nboson resonant production at $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders by convoluting\nwith the beam energy spread profile of the collider and the Breit-Wigner\nresonance profile of the signal. We assess their impact on both the Higgs\nsignal and SM backgrounds for the leading decay channels $h\\rightarrow b\\bar\nb,\\ WW^*$. Our study improves the existing analyses of the proposed future\nresonant Higgs factories and provides further guidance for the accelerator\ndesigns with respect to the physical goals.\n", "  We report the measurement of collisions between two Bose-Einstein condensates\nwith strong dipolar interactions. The collision velocity is significantly\nlarger than the internal velocity distribution widths of the individual\ncondensates, and thus, with the condensates being sufficiently dilute, a halo\ncorresponding to the two-body differential scattering cross section is\nobserved. The results demonstrate a novel regime of quantum scattering,\nrelevant to dipolar interactions, in which a large number of angular momentum\nstates become coupled during the collision. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations\nto provide a detailed comparison between theoretical two-body cross sections\nand the experimental observations.\n", "  Finite-${\\mathbf Q}$ magnetic instabilities are rather common in frustrated\nmagnets. When the magnetic susceptibility is maximized at multiple-${\\mathbf\nQ}$ vectors related through lattice symmetry operations, exotic magnetic\norderings such as vortex and skyrmion crystals may follow. Here we show that a\nperiodic array of nonmagnetic impurities, which can be realized through charge\ndensity wave ordering, leads to a rich phase diagram featuring a plethora of\nchiral magnetic phases, especially when there is a simple relation between the\nreciprocal vectors of the impurity superlattice and the magnetic ${\\mathbf\nQ}$-vectors. We also investigate the effect of changing the impurity\nconcentration or disturbing the impurity array with small quenched randomness.\nAlternative realizations of impurity superlattices are briefly discussed.\n", "  Calvera is an unusual isolated neutron star with pure thermal X-ray spectrum\ntypical for central compact objects in supernova remnants. On the other hand,\nits rotation period and spin-down rate are typical for ordinary\nrotation-powered pulsars. It was discovered and studied in X-rays and not yet\ndetected in other spectral domains. We present deep optical imaging of the\nCalvera field obtained with the Gran Telescopio Canarias in $g'$ and $i'$\nbands. Within $\\approx 1^{\\prime\\prime}$ vicinity of Calvera, we detected two\npoint-like objects invisible at previous shallow observations. However,\naccurate astrometry showed that none of them can be identified with the pulsar.\nWe put new upper limits on its optical brightness of $g' > 27.87$ and $i' >\n26.84$. We also reanalyzed all available archival X-ray data on Calvera.\nComparison of the Calvera thermal emission parameters and upper limits on\noptical and non-thermal X-ray emission with respective data on rotation-powered\npulsars shows that Calvera might belong to the class of ordinary middle-aged\npulsars, if we assume that its distance is in the range of $1.5-5$ kpc.\n", "  We consider the vacuum Einstein flow with a positive cosmological constant on\nspatial manifolds of product form. In spatial dimension at least four we show\nthe existence of continuous families of recollapsing models whenever at least\none of the factors or admits a Riemannian Einstein metric with positive\nEinstein constant. We moreover show that these families belong to larger\ncontinuous families with models that have two complete time directions, i.e. do\nnot recollapse. Complementarily, we show that whenever no factor has positive\ncurvature, then any model in the product class expands in one time direction\nand collapses in the other. In particular, positive curvature of one factor is\na necessary criterion for recollapse within this class. Finally, we relate our\nresults to the instability of the Nariai solution in three spatial dimensions\nand point out why a similar construction of recollapsing models in that\ndimension fails. The present results imply that there exist different classes\nof initial data which exhibit fundamentally different types of long-time\nbehavior under the Einstein flow whenever the spatial dimension is strictly\nlarger than three. Moreover, this behavior is related to the spatial topology\nthrough the existence of Riemannian Einstein metrics of positive curvature.\n", "  Correlators based on $s\\ell_2$ Yangian symmetry and its quantum deformation\nare studied. Symmetric integral operators can be defined with such correlators\nas kernels. Yang-Baxter operators can be represented in this way. Particular\nYangian symmetric correlators are related to the kernels of QCD parton\nevolution. The solution of the eigenvalue problem of Yangian symmetric\noperators is described.\n", "  We revisit minimal supersymmetric SU(5) grand unification (GUT) models in\nwhich the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters of the minimal supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) are universal at some input scale, $M_{in}$, above the\nsupersymmetric gauge coupling unification scale, $M_{GUT}$. As in the\nconstrained MSSM (CMSSM), we assume that the scalar masses and gaugino masses\nhave common values, $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ respectively, at $M_{in}$, as do the\ntrilinear soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters $A_0$. Going beyond previous\nstudies of such a super-GUT CMSSM scenario, we explore the constraints imposed\nby the lower limit on the proton lifetime and the LHC measurement of the Higgs\nmass, $m_h$. We find regions of $m_0$, $m_{1/2}$, $A_0$ and the parameters of\nthe SU(5) superpotential that are compatible with these and other\nphenomenological constraints such as the density of cold dark matter, which we\nassume to be provided by the lightest neutralino. Typically, these allowed\nregions appear for $m_0$ and $m_{1/2}$ in the multi-TeV region, for suitable\nvalues of the unknown SU(5) GUT-scale phases and superpotential couplings, and\nwith the ratio of supersymmetric Higgs vacuum expectation values $\\tan \\beta\n\\lesssim 6$.\n", "  We investigate a long time asymptotic state of periodically driven open\nquantum systems analytically. The model we consider in this paper is a free\nfermionic system coupled to an energy and particle reservoir. We clarify some\ngeneric properties of the system which are independent of the details of the\nreservoir in the high frequency regime of the external driving. When the\nfrequency of the external driving is much larger than the energy cutoff of the\nsystem-reservoir coupling, the low-energy properties of the system are\nequivalent to those of the Gibbs distribution of a Floquet effective\nHamiltonian. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of finite dissipation on\nthe system, and elucidate that we cannot suppress excitations by merely\nincreasing the system-reservoir coupling because the excitations are created\nthrough the reservoir by the external driving when the frequency is smaller\nthan the energy cutoff of the system-reservoir coupling.\n", "  A proof that almost all quantum systems have trap free (that is, free from\nlocal optima) landscapes is presented for a large and physically general class\nof quantum system. This result offers an explanation for why gradient methods\nsucceed so frequently in quantum control in both theory and practice. The role\nof singular controls is analyzed using geometric tools in the case of the\ncontrol of the propagator of closed finite dimension systems. This type of\ncontrol field has been implicated as a source of landscape traps. The\nconditions under which singular controls can introduce traps, and thus\ninterrupt the progress of a control optimization, are discussed and a\ngeometrical characterization of the issue is presented. It is shown that a\ncontrol being singular is not sufficient to cause a control optimization\nprogress to halt and sufficient conditions for a trap free landscape are\npresented. It is further shown that the local surjectivity axiom of landscape\nanalysis can be refined to the condition that the end-point map is transverse\nto each of the level sets of the fidelity function. This novel condition is\nshown to be sufficient for a quantum system's landscape to be trap free. The\ncontrol landscape for a quantum system is shown to be trap free for all but a\nnull set of Hamiltonians using a novel geometric technique based on the\nparametric transversality theorem. Numerical evidence confirming this is also\npresented. This result is the analogue of the work of Altifini, wherein it is\nshown that controllability holds for all but a null set of quantum systems in\nthe dipole approximation. The presented results indicate that by-and-large\nlimited control resources are the most physically relevant source of landscape\ntraps.\n", "  We present magnetoresistance (MR) experiments on an InAs nanowire quantum dot\ndevice with two ferromagnetic sidegates (FSGs) in a split-gate geometry. The\nwire segment can be electrically tuned to a single dot or to a double dot\nregime using the FSGs and a backgate. In both regimes we find a strong MR and a\nsharp MR switching of up to 25\\% at the field at which the magnetizations of\nthe FSGs are inverted by the external field. The sign and amplitude of the MR\nand the MR switching can both be tuned electrically by the FSGs. In a double\ndot regime close to pinch-off we find {\\it two} sharp transitions in the\nconductance, reminiscent of tunneling MR (TMR) between two ferromagnetic\ncontacts, with one transition near zero and one at the FSG switching fields.\nThese surprisingly rich characteristics we explain in several simple resonant\ntunneling models. For example, the TMR-like MR can be understood as a\nstray-field controlled transition between singlet and a triplet double dot\nstates. Such local magnetic fields are the key elements in various proposals to\nengineer novel states of matter and may be used for testing electron spin-based\nBell inequalities.\n", "  Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation provides the means to perform fast\nand robust quantum gates by utilizing the resilience of non-Abelian geometric\nphases to fluctuations of the path in state space. While the original scheme\n[New J. Phys. {\\bf 14}, 103035 (2012)] needs two loops in the Grassmann\nmanifold (i.e., the space of computational subspaces of the full state space)\nto generate an arbitrary holonomic one-qubit gate, we propose single-loop\none-qubit gates that constitute an efficient universal set of holonomic gates\nwhen combined with an entangling holonomic two-qubit gate. Our one-qubit gate\nis realized by dividing the loop into path segments, each of which is generated\nby a $\\Lambda$-type Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that two path segments are\nsufficient to realize arbitrary single-loop holonomic one-qubit gates. We\ndescribe how our scheme can be implemented experimentally in a generic atomic\nsystem exhibiting a three-level $\\Lambda$-coupling structure, by utilizing\ncarefully chosen laser pulses.\n", "  Imperfections in integrated photonics manufacturing have a detrimental effect\non the maximal achievable visibility in interferometric architectures. These\nlimits have profound implications for further photonics technological\ndevelopments and in particular for quantum photonics technologies. Active\noptimisation approaches, together with reconfigurable photonics, have been\nproposed as a solution to overcome this. In this paper, we demonstrate an\nultra-high (>60 dB) extinction ratio in a silicon photonic device consisting of\ncascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers, in which additional interferometers\nfunction as variable beamsplitters. The imperfections of fabricated\nbeamsplitters are compensated using an automated progressive optimization\nalgorithm with no requirement for pre-calibration. This work shows the\npossibility of integrating and accurately controlling linear-optical components\nfor large-scale quantum information processing and other applications.\n", "  Charge inversion occurring for smeared-out ions is accompanied by an\noscillatory charge density profile, indicating a layering of an alternating\ncharge. The layering effect, however, is not coextensive with charge inversion,\nand charge inversion accompanied by a monotonically decaying profile is\npossible. The present work focuses on the structure of a double-layer of\noverscreened charged surfaces by smeared-out charges and probes the link\nbetween the structure of a double-layer and the bulk properties of an\nelectrolyte, with special view to the role of the Kirkwood crossover.\n", "  Gravitational waves emitted by distorted black holes---such as those arising\nfrom the coalescence of two neutron stars or black holes---carry not only\ninformation about the corresponding spacetime but also about the underlying\ntheory of gravity. Although general relativity remains the simplest, most\nelegant and viable theory of gravitation, there are generic and robust\narguments indicating that it is not the ultimate description of the\ngravitational universe. Here we focus on a particularly appealing extension of\ngeneral relativity, which corrects Einstein's theory through the addition of\nterms which are second order in curvature: the topological Gauss-Bonnet\ninvariant coupled to a dilaton. We study gravitational-wave emission from black\nholes in this theory, and {\\bf(i)} find strong evidence that black holes are\nlinearly (mode) stable against both axial and polar perturbations; {\\bf(ii)}\ndiscuss how the quasinormal modes of black holes can be excited during\ncollisions involving black holes, and finally {\\bf(iii)} show that future\nringdown detections with large signal-to-noise ratio would improve current\nconstraints on the coupling parameter of the theory.\n", "  When modelling inflaton fluctuations as a free quantum scalar field, the\ninitial vacuum is conventionally imposed at the infinite past. This is called\nthe Bunch-Davies (BD) vacuum. If however an asymptotically Minkowskian past\ndoes not exist, this requires modifications. We derive corrections to the\nscalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor tilt $n_t$ descending from arbitrary\nmixed states or from explicit non-BD initial conditions. The former may stem\nfrom some pre-inflationary background and can redshift away whereas the latter\nare induced by a timelike hypersurface parametrising a physical cut-off. In\nboth cases, we find that corrections scale in parts or fully as $\\mathcal\nO(\\epsilon)$ where $\\epsilon$ is the first slow-roll parameter. The precise\nobservational footprint is hence dependent on the model driving inflation.\nFurther, we show how the inflationary consistency relation is altered. We thus\nprovide an analytic handle on possible high scale or pre-inflationary physics.\n", "  We analyse the rare kaon decays $K_S \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and $K_S \\to\n\\gamma\\ell^+\\ell^-$ $(\\ell = e \\mbox{ or } \\mu)$ in a dispersive framework in\nwhich the weak Hamiltonian carries momentum. Our analysis extends predictions\nfrom lowest order $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R$ chiral perturbation theory\n($\\chi$PT$_3$) to fully account for effects from final-state interactions, and\nis free from ambiguities associated with extrapolating the kaon off-shell.\nGiven input from $K_S \\to \\pi\\pi$ and $\\gamma\\gamma^{(*)}\\to\\pi\\pi$, we solve\nthe once-subtracted dispersion relations numerically to predict the rates for\n$K_S \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and $K_S \\to \\gamma\\ell^+\\ell^-$. In the leptonic modes,\nwe find sizeable corrections to the $\\chi$PT$_3$ predictions for the integrated\nrates.\n", "  In this paper we present a portable magnetocardiography device. The focus of\nthis development was delivering a rapid assessment of chest pain in an\nemergency department. The aim was therefore to produce an inexpensive device\nthat could be rapidly deployed in a noisy unshielded ward environment. We found\nthat induction coil magnetometers with a coil design optimized for magnetic\nfield mapping possess sufficient sensitivity ($104fT/\\sqrt{Hz}$ noise floor at\n10Hz) and response ($813fT/\\mu V$ at 10Hz) for cycle averaged\nmagnetocardiography and are able to measure depolarisation signals in an\nunshielded environment. We were unable to observe repolarisation signals to a\nreasonable fidelity. We present the design of the induction coil sensor array\nand signal processing routine along with data demonstrating performance in a\nhospital environment.\n", "  In this work we try to use the Monte Carlo algorithm, metropolis, to study\nthe behavior of 2D magnetic systems; honeycomb, hexagonal and square lattices.\nIn this study we use Ising Model of magnetism, with considering only nearest\nneighbors in the Hamiltonian and with the Ferromagnetic correlation constant.\nThe code was written in Payton. In this calculation, by comparing the results\nobtained for all lattices, we will show that the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic\nphase transition depends on the number of neighbor and it is a direct\ndependence.\n", "  Many physics departments around the world have electronic and mechanical\nworkshops attached to them. The job of these workshops is to design and build\nexperimental setups and instruments for research and the training of\nundergraduate students.\n  However, in developing countries such as Sudan the lack of qualified\ntechnicians and adequately equipped workshops hampered efforts by these\ndepartments to supplement their laboratories with home built equipment. The\nonly other option is to buy needed equipment and experimental setups from\nspecialized manufactures. The latter option is not feasible the departments in\ndeveloping countries where funding for education and research is scarce and\nvery limited as equipments from these manufactures are typically too expensive.\n  In the past couple of years and with the advancement in prototyping tools\nlike Arduino, and microcontroller development boards, more friendly programming\nlanguages, 3D printers, desktop CNC machines and easy to use CAD/CAM softwares\nthe need for highly qualified technicians and expensive workshop equipment was\nthen relaxed \\cite{nature-flypi}. The availability of such affordable, and\nrelatively easy to use tools had the effect of increasing the number of\nteachers and researchers willing to develop their own experimental\nsetups\\cite{polis-flypi}.\n  During the past year and motivated by the need to equip our laboratories with\nnew setups we established a small workshop at the Department of Physics for\ndeveloping experimental setups to be used in our undergraduate laboratories.\nThe ultrasonic signal generator we are describing here is one such equipment.\n", "  Quasidefinite sesquilinear forms for Laurent polynomials in the complex plane\nand corresponding CMV biorthogonal Laurent polynomial families are studied.\nBivariate linear functionals encompass large families of orthogonalities like\nSobolev and discrete Sobolev types. Two possible Christoffel transformations of\nthese linear functionals are discussed. Either the linear functionals are\nmultiplied by a Laurent polynomial, or are multiplied by the complex conjugate\nof a Laurent polynomial. For the Geronimus transformation, the linear\nfunctional is perturbed in two possible manners as well, by a division by a\nLaurent polynomial or by a complex conjugate of a Laurent polynomial, in both\ncases the addition of appropriate masses (linear functionals supported on the\nzeros of the perturbing Laurent polynomial) is considered. The connection\nformulas for the CMV biorthogonal Laurent polynomials, its norms, and\nChristoffel-Darboux kernels, in all the four cases, are given. For the\nGeronimus transformation, the connection formulas for the second kind functions\nand mixed Christoffel-Darboux kernels are also given in the two possible cases.\nFor prepared Laurent polynomials, i.e. of the form\n$L(z)=L_nz^n+\\cdots+L_{-n}z^{-n}$, $L_nL_{-n}\\neq 0$, these connection formulas\nlead to quasideterminantal (quotient of determinants) Christoffel formulas for\nall the four transformations, expressing an arbitrary degree perturbed\nbiorthogonal Laurent polynomial in terms of $2n$ unperturbed biorthogonal\nLaurent polynomials, their second kind functions or Christoffel-Darboux kernels\nand its mixed versions. The unit circle case, given its exceptional properties,\nis discussed in more detail.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a protocol to prepare W states with superconducting\nquantum interference devices (SQUID) by using dressed states. Through choosing\na set of dressed states suitably, the protocol can be used to accelerate the\nadiabatic passages while additional couplings are unnecessary. Moreover, we can\noptimize the evolution of the system with the restraint to the populations of\nthe intermediate states by choosing suitable controlled parameters. Numerical\nsimulations show that the protocol is robust against the parameter variations\nand decoherence mechanisms. Furthermore, the protocol is faster and more robust\nagainst the dephasing, compared with that by the adiabatic passages. As for the\nRabi frequencies of pulses designed by the method, they can be expressed by the\nlinear superpositions of Gaussian functions, which does not increase\ndifficulties to the experiments. In addition, the protocol could be controlled\nand manipulated easily in experiments with a circuit quantum electrodynamics\nsystem.\n", "  The charge susceptibility of twisted bilayer graphene is investigated in the\nDirac cone, respectively random-phase approximation. For small enough twist\nangles $\\theta\\lesssim 2^\\circ$ we find weakly Landau damped interband\nplasmons, i.~e., collective excitonic modes which exist in the undoped\nmaterial, with an almost constant energy dispersion. In this regime, the loss\nfunction can be described as a Fano resonance and we argue that these\nexcitations arise from the interaction of quasi-localised states with the\nincident light field. These predictions can be tested by nano-infrared imaging\nand possible applications include a \"perfect\" lens without the need of\nleft-handed materials.\n", "  There is an increased interest in the scientific community in the problem of\nmeasuring gender homophily in co-authorship on scholarly publications (Eisen,\n2016). For a given set of publications and co-authorships, we assume that\nauthor identities have not been disambiguated in that we do not know when one\nperson is an author on more than one paper. In this case, one way to think\nabout measuring gender homophily is to consider all observed co-authorship\npairs and obtain a set-based gender homophily coefficient (e.g., Bergstrom et\nal., 2016). Another way is to consider papers as observed disjoint networks of\nco-authors and use a network-based assortativity coefficient (e.g., Newman,\n2003). In this note, we review both metrics and show that the gender homophily\nset-based index is equivalent to the gender assortativity network-based\ncoefficient with properly weighted edges.\n", "  The Weihai Echelle Spectrograph (WES) is the first fiber-fed echelle\nspectrograph for astronomical observation in China. It is primarily used for\nchemical abundance and asteroseismology studies of nearby bright stars, as well\nas radial velocity detections for exoplanets. The optical design of WES is\nbased on the widely demonstrated and well-established white-pupil concept. We\ndescribe the WES in detail and present some examples of its performance. A\nsingle exposure echelle image covers the spectral region 371-1,100 nm in 107\nspectral orders over the rectangular CCD. The spectral resolution\n$R=\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda$ changes from 40,600 to 57,000 through adjusting the\nentrance slit width from full to 2.2 pixels sampling at the fiber-exit. The\nlimiting magnitude scales to $V=8$ with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more\nthan 100 in $V$ for an hour exposure, at the spectral resolution\nR$\\approx$40,000 in the median seeing of 1.7$^{\\prime\\prime}$ at Weihai\nObservatory (WHO) for the 1-meter telescope. The radial velocity (RV)\nmeasurement accuracy of WES is estimated to be $<$10 m/s in 10 months (302\ndays) and better than 15 m/s in 4.4 years (1,617 days) in the recent data\nprocessing.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyze the thermodynamics of a small singly spinning\nKerr-AdS black hole. As the black hole will be sufficient small, its\ntemperature will be large and so we can not neglect the effects of thermal\nfluctuations. We will demonstrate that these thermal fluctuations correct the\nentropy of singly spinning Kerr-AdS black hole by a logarithmic correction\nterm. We will analyze the implications of the logarithmic correction on other\nthermodynamic properties of this black hole, and analyze the stability of such\na black hole. We will observe that this form of correction becomes important\nwhen the size of the black hole is sufficient small. We will also analyze the\neffect of these thermal fluctuations on the critical phenomena for such a black\nhole.\n", "  The phase diagram of hydrogen is one of the most important challenges in\nhigh-pressure physics and astrophysics. Especially, the melting of dense\nhydrogen is complicated by dimer dissociation, metallization and nuclear\nquantum effect of protons, which together lead to a cold melting of dense\nhydrogen when above 500 GPa. Nonetheless, the variation of the melting curve at\nhigher pressures is virtually uncharted. Here we report that using ab initio\nmolecular dynamics and path integral simulations based on density functional\ntheory, a new atomic phase is discovered, which gives an uplifting melting\ncurve of dense hydrogen when beyond 2 TPa, and results in a reentrant\nsolid-liquid transition before entering the Wigner crystalline phase of\nprotons. The findings greatly extend the phase diagram of dense hydrogen, and\nput metallic hydrogen into the group of alkali metals, with its melting curve\nclosely resembling those of lithium and sodium.\n", "  Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) perform a broad range of biological\nfunctions. Their relevance has motivated intense research activity seeking to\ncharacterize their sequence/structure/function relationships. However, the\nconformational plasticity of these molecules hampers the application of\ntraditional structural approaches, and new tools and concepts are being\ndeveloped to address the challenges they pose. Small-Angle Scattering (SAS) is\na structural biology technique that probes the size and shape of disordered\nproteins and their complexes with other biomolecules. The low-resolution nature\nof SAS can be compensated with specially designed computational tools and its\ncombined interpretation with complementary structural information. In this\nreview, we describe recent advances in the application of SAS to disordered\nproteins and highly flexible complexes and discuss current challenges.\n", "  Next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain plays important roles in solid state\nphysics, such as predicting exotic electric properties of two-dimensional\nmaterials or magnetic properties of organic compounds. Direct experimental\nstudies of the many-body electron systems or spin systems associating to these\nmaterials are challenging tasks, while optical simulation provides an effective\nand economical way for immediate observation. Comparing with bulk optics,\nintegrated optics are more of fascinating for steady, large scale and long-time\nevolution simulations. Photonic crystal is an artificial microstructure\nmaterial with multiple methods to tune the propagation properties, which are\nessential for various simulation tasks. Here we report for the first time an\nexperimental simulation of next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg chain with an\nintegrated optical chip of photonic crystal waveguide array. The use of\nphotonic crystal enhances evanescent field thus allows coupling between\nnext-nearest-neighbor waveguides in such a planar waveguide array, without\nbreaking the weak coupling condition of the coupled mode equation.\nParticularly, similarities between the model and coherent light propagation\ncould reach 0.99 in numerical simulations and 0.89 in experiment. Localization\neffect induced by second-order coupling and coupling strengthening with\nincreasing wavelengths were also revealed in both numerical simulations and\nexperiments. The platform proposed here is compatible with mature complementary\nmetal oxide semiconductor technology thus possesses the potential for\nlarger-scale problems and photonic crystals further allows simulations of\nspecific target Hamiltonians.\n", "  We present a yield simulator to predict the number and characteristics of\nplanets, false positives and false alarms in transit surveys. The simulator is\nbased on a galactic model and the planet occurrence rates measured by the\nKepler mission. It takes into account the observation window function and\nmeasured noise levels of the investigated survey. Additionally, it includes\nvetting criteria to identify false positives. We apply this simulator to the\nNext Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), a wide-field survey designed to detect\ntransiting Neptune-sized exoplanets. We find that red noise is the main\nlimitation of NGTS up to 14th magnitude, and that its obtained level determines\nthe expected yield. Assuming a red noise level of 1 mmag, the simulation\npredicts the following for a four-year survey: 4+-3 Super-Earths, 19+-5 Small\nNeptunes, 16+-4 Large Neptunes, 55+-8 Saturn-sized planets and 150+-10\nJupiter-sized planets, along with 4688+-45 eclipsing binaries and 843+-75\nbackground eclipsing binaries. We characterize the properties of these objects\nto enhance the early identification of false positives and discuss follow-up\nstrategies for transiting candidates.\n", "  The interpretation of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data in the framework of\nBeyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories is hampered by the need to run\ncomputationally expensive event generators and detector simulators. Performing\nstatistically convergent scans of high-dimensional BSM theories is consequently\nchallenging, and in practice unfeasible for very high-dimensional BSM theories.\nWe present here a new machine learning method that accelerates the\ninterpretation of LHC data, by learning the relationship between BSM theory\nparameters and data. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that this technique\naccurately predicts natural SUSY signal events in two signal regions at the\nHigh Luminosity LHC, up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard\ntechniques. The new approach makes it possible to rapidly and accurately\nreconstruct the theory parameters of complex BSM theories, should an excess in\nthe data be discovered at the LHC.\n", "  In this article the robustness of tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) and W states is investigated against Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (i.e. DM)\ninteraction. We consider a closed system of three qubits and an environmental\nqubit. The environmental qubit interacts with any one of the three qubits\nthrough DM interaction. The tripartite system is initially prepared in GHZ and\nW states respectively. The composite four qubits system evolve with unitary\ndynamics. We detach the environmental qubit by tracing out from four qubits and\nprofound impact of DM interaction is studied on the initial entanglement of the\nsystem. As a result we find that the bipartite partitions of W states suffer\nfrom entanglement sudden death (i.e. ESD), while tripartite entanglement does\nnot. On the other hand bipartite partitions and tripartite entanglement in GHZ\nstates does not feel any influence of DM interaction. So, we find that GHZ\nstates have robust character than W states. In this work we consider\ngeneralised GHZ and W states and three $\\pi$ is used as an entanglement\nmeasure. This study can be useful in quantum information processing where\nunwanted DM interaction takes place.\n", "  In this work, we use a double-layered stack of TiO2 nanotubes (TiNTs) to\nconstruct a visible-light triggered drug delivery system. Key for visible-light\ndrug release is a hydrophobic cap on the nanotubes containing Au nanoparticles\n(AuNPs). The AuNPs allow for a photocatalytic scission of the hydrophobic chain\nunder visible light. To demonstrate the principle, we loaded antibiotic\n(ampicillin sodium (AMP)) in the lower part of the TiO2 nanotube stack,\ntriggered visible light induced release, and carried out antibacterial studies.\nThe release from the platform becomes most controllable if the drug is\nsilane-grafted in hydrophilic bottom layer for drug storage. Thus visible-light\nphotocatalysis can also determine the release kinetics of the active drug from\nthe nanotube wall.\n", "  We review some of the results obtained by introducing a thermodynamic\npressure via the cosmological constant in a class of higher curvature theories\nknown as Lovelock gravity. In particular, we focus on a specific relation\nbetween the higher-order Lovelock couplings that introduces a peculiar isolated\ncritical point for hyperbolic black holes characterized by non-standard\ncritical exponents.\n", "  In this study, we make non-invasive, remote, passive measurements of the\nheart beat frequency and determine the map of blood pulsation intensity in a\nregion of interest (ROI) of skin. The ROI used was the forearm of a volunteer.\nThe method employs a regular video camera and visible light, and the video\nacquisition takes less than 1 minute. The mean cardiac frequency found in our\nvolunteer was within 1 bpm of the ground-truth value simultaneously obtained\nvia earlobe plethysmography. Using the signals extracted from the video images,\nwe have determined an intensity map for the blood pulsation at the surface of\nthe skin. In this paper we present the experimental and data processing details\nof the work and well as limitations of the technique.\n  -----------------------------------------\n  Neste estudo medimos a frequ\\^encia card\\'iaca de forma n\\~ao invasiva,\nremota e passiva e determinamos o mapa da atividade de pulsa\\c{c}\\~ao\nsangu\\'inea numa regi\\~ao de interesse (ROI) da pele.

Quantum\ncryptography systems are typically built between two nodes connected to each\nother through fiber optic. This chapter focuses on quantum cryptography systems\noperating over free-space optical channels as a cost-effective and license-free\nalternative to fiber optic counterparts. It provides an overview of the\ndifferent parts of an experimental free-space quantum communication link\ndeveloped in the Spanish National Research Council (Madrid, Spain).\n", "  The concept of spectrum for a class of non-linear wave equations is studied.\nInstead of looking for stability, the key to the spectral structure is found in\nthe instability phenomena (bifurcations). This aspect is best seen in the\n`classical model' of the non-linear wave mechanics. The solitons\n(macro-localizations) are a part of the non-linear spectral problem; their\nbifurcations reflect the dynamical symmetry breaking. The computer simulations\nsuggest that the bifurcations of the asymptotic behaviour occur also for the\ngeneral, non-stationary states. A~phenomenon of the soliton splitting is\nobserved.\n", "  This paper is a continuation of the recent paper \"CMV biorthogonal Laurent\npolynomials: Christoffel formulas for Christoffel and Geronimus\ntransformations\" by the same authors. The behavior of quasidefinite\nsesquilinear forms for Laurent polynomials in the complex plane, characterized\nby bivariate linear functionals, and corresponding CMV biorthogonal Laurent\npolynomial families --including Sobolev and discrete Sobolev orthogonalities---\nunder two type of Geronimus--Uvarov transformations is studied. Either the\nlinear functionals are multiplied by a Laurent polynomial and divided by the\ncomplex conjugate of a Laurent polynomial, with the addition of appropriate\nmasses (linear functionals supported on the zeros of the perturbing Laurent\npolynomial in the denominator) or vice-versa, multiplied by the complex\nconjugate of a Laurent polynomial and divided by a Laurent polynomial. The\nconnection formulas for the CMV biorthogonal Laurent polynomials, their norms,\nand Christoffel--Darboux kernels are given. For prepared Laurent polynomials\nthese connection formulas lead to quasideterminantal (quotient of determinants)\nChristoffel formulas expressing an arbitrary degree perturbed biorthogonal\nLaurent polynomial in terms of $2N_{\\mathfrak C}+2N_\\Gamma$ unperturbed\nbiorthogonal Laurent polynomials, their second kind functions or\nChristoffel--Darboux kernel and its mixed versions. When the linear functionals\nare supported on the unit circle, a particularly relevant role is played by the\nreciprocal polynomial, and the Christoffel formulas provide now with two\npossible ways of expressing the same perturbed quantities in terms of the\noriginal ones, one using only the nonperturbed biorthogonal family of Laurent\npolynomials, and the other using the Christoffel--Darboux kernel and its mixed\nversions.\n", "  Configurations of the IsoDAR and DAE{\\delta}ALUS decay-at-rest neutrino\nexperiments are described. Injector and cyclotron developments aimed at\nsubstantial increases in beam current are discussed. The IsoDAR layout and\ntarget are described, and this experiment is compared to other programs\nsearching for sterile neutrinos.\n", "  Geo-neutrino observations probe the quantities and distributions of\nterrestrial heat-producing elements uranium and thorium. The quantities of\nthese elements gauge global radiogenic power, offering insights into the origin\nand thermal history of the Earth. The distributions reveal the initial\npartitioning and subsequent transport of these trace elements between metallic\ncore, silicate mantle, and crust types. Ongoing observations at underground\nsites in Japan and Italy record the energies but not the directions of\ngeo-neutrinos from uranium and thorium. Without directions pointing back to\nsource regions, disentangling the signals from various reservoirs requires\nresolution of differing rates or energy spectra at separate sites. Due to\nlimited statistics and site contrast, however, the observations at Japan and\nItaly do not yet measure distinct rates or energy spectra. Further analyses of\nthe observations that derive fluxes, determine a signal from the mantle, and\nassess the global radiogenic power of uranium and thorium, depend on\ngeochemical assumptions and model predictions. This letter discusses\nopportunities for eliminating or minimizing these dependencies through\nobservations at dissimilar sites, producing robust geo-neutrino results.\n", "  In practice many problems related to space/time fractional equations depend\non fractional parameters. But these fractional parameters are not known a\npriori in modelling problems. Hence continuity of the solutions with respect to\nthese parameters is important for modelling purposes.\n  In this paper we will study the continuity of the solutions of a class of\nequations including the Abel equations of the first and second kind, and time\nfractional diffusion type equations. We consider continuity with respect to the\nfractional parameters as well as the initial value.\n", "  A tight-binding model of bcc tungsten that includes spin-orbit coupling is\ndeveloped and applied to the surface states of (110) tungsten thin films. The\nmodel describes accurately the anisotropic Dirac cone-like dispersion and\nRashba-like spin polarization of the surface states, including the crucial\neffect of the relaxation of the surface atomic layer of the tungsten towards\nthe bulk. It is shown that the surface relaxation affects the tungsten surface\nstates because it results in increased overlaps between atomic orbitals of the\nsurface atomic layer and nearby layers whereas electric fields that are due to\ncharge transfer between the tungsten and the vacuum near the surface or between\nthe bulk and surface layers do not significantly affect the Rashba-Dirac\nsurface states. It is found that hybridization with bulk modes has differing\nstrengths for thin film surface states belonging to the upper and lower\nRashba-Dirac cones and results in $reversal$ of the directions of travel of\nspin $\\uparrow$ and $\\downarrow$ electrons in most of the upper Rashba-Dirac\ncone relative to those expected from phenomenology. It is also shown that\nintrasite (not intersite) matrix elements of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian are\nprimarily responsible for the formation of the Rashba-Dirac cones, and their\nspin polarization. This finding should be considered when modeling topological\ninsulators, the spin Hall effect and related phenomena.\n", "  Electronic structure of single crystalline\nBa(Zn$_{0.875}$Mn$_{0.125}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$, parent compound of the recently\nfounded high-temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor, was studied by\nhigh-resolution photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Through systematically\nphoton energy and polarization dependent measurements, the energy bands along\nthe out-of-plane and in-plane directions were experimentally determined. Except\nthe localized states of Mn, the measured band dispersions agree very well with\nthe first-principle calculations of undoped BaZn$_{2}$As$_{2}$. A new feature\nrelated to Mn 3d states was identified at the binding energies of about -1.6 eV\nbesides the previously observed feature at about -3.3 eV. We suggest that the\nhybridization between Mn and As orbitals strongly enhanced the density of\nstates around -1.6 eV. Although our resolution is much better compared with\nprevious soft X-ray photoemission experiments, no clear hybridization gap\nbetween Mn 3d states and the valence bands proposed by previous model\ncalculations was detected.\n", "  The derivation of the boson representation of spin operators is given which\nreproduces the Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson-Maleev transformations in the\ncorresponding cases. The suggested formalism allows to address some subtle\nissues which appear crucial for treating certain class of problems. Moreover,\nthe transformation is suggested which is naturally related to the symmetry of\nthe spin systems.\n", "  Recent analytical work on the modelling of dark halo abundances and\nclustering has demonstrated the advantages of combining the excursion set\napproach with peaks theory. We extend these ideas and introduce a model of\nexcursion set peaks that incorporates the role of initial tidal effects or\nshear in determining the gravitational collapse of dark haloes. The model -- in\nwhich the critical density threshold for collapse depends on the tidal\ninfluences acting on protohaloes -- is well motivated from ellipsoidal collapse\narguments and is also simple enough to be analytically tractable. We show that\nthe predictions of this model are in very good agreement with measurements of\nthe halo mass function and traditional scale dependent halo bias in N-body\nsimulations across a wide range of masses and redshift. The presence of shear\nin the collapse threshold means that halo bias is naturally predicted to be\nnonlocal, and that protohalo densities at fixed mass are naturally predicted to\nhave Lognormal-like distributions. We present the first direct estimate of\nLagrangian nonlocal bias in N-body simulations, finding broad agreement with\nthe model prediction. Finally, the simplicity of the model (which has\nessentially a single free parameter) opens the door to building efficient and\naccurate non-universal fitting functions of halo abundances and bias for use in\nprecision cosmology.\n", "  We measured dispersive spin excitations in $\\mathrm{SmFeAsO}$, parent\ncompound of $\\mathrm{SmFeAsO_{\\text{1-x}}F_{\\text{x}}}$ one of the highest\ntemperature superconductors of Fe pnictides (T$_{\\text{C}}\\approx$55~K). We\ndetermine the magnetic excitations to disperse with a bandwidth energy of ca\n170 meV at (0.47, 0) and (0.34, 0.34), which merges into the elastic line\napproaching the $\\Gamma$ point. Comparing our results with other parent Fe\npnictides, we show the importance of structural parameters for the magnetic\nexcitation spectrum, with small modifications of the tetrahedron angles and As\nheight strongly affecting the magnetism.\n", "  We have used Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) and dynamical\nsusceptibility calculations to study the magnetic excitations in\nNaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$As (x = 0, 0.03, and 0.08). Despite a relatively low ordered\nmagnetic moment, collective magnetic modes are observed in parent compounds (x\n= 0) and persist in optimally (x = 0.03) and overdoped (x = 0.08) samples.\nTheir magnetic bandwidths are unaffected by doping within the range\ninvestigated. High energy magnetic excitations in iron pnictides are robust\nagainst doping, and present irrespectively of the ordered magnetic moment.\nNevertheless, Co doping slightly reduces the overall magnetic spectral weight,\ndifferently from previous studies on hole-doped BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, where it\nwas observed constant. Finally, we demonstrate that the doping evolution of\nmagnetic modes is different for the dopants being inside or outside the Fe-As\nlayer.\n", "  Evidence for a local 'Single Source' of cosmic rays is amassing by way of the\nrecent precise measurements of various cosmic ray energy spectra from the\nAMS-02 instrument. To observations of individual cosmic ray nuclei, electrons,\npositrons and antiprotons must now be added the determination of the\nboron-to-carbon ratio and the energy spectrum of lithium to 2000 GV with high\nprecision. Our analysis leads us to claim that, with certain assumptions about\npropagation in the Galaxy, the results confirm our arguments regarding the\npresence of a local single source, perhaps, a supernova remnant (SNR). An\nattempt is made to determine some of the properties of this SNR and its\nprogenitor star.\n", "  We study the efficiency of DUNE, a next generation long baseline oscillation\nexperiment to resolve two major unknowns in neutrino oscillation physics. These\nare, octant of $\\theta_{23}$ (i.e. if $\\theta_{23}$ is $< 45^\\circ$ or\n$>45^\\circ$) and Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$. We mainly focus on the role of\nantineutrinos when they travel 1300 km baseline of DUNE. We observe that for\nDUNE, the antineutrino runs help to remove parameter degeneracies even in the\nparameter space where the antineutrino probability suffers from various\ndegeneracies. We study these points in detail and find that, due to enhanced\nmatter effect longer baseline experiments create an increased tension between\nthe neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities which helps to increase total\nsensitivity in case of combined runs. We also find that, antineutrino run\nincreases overall CP sensitivity due to its ability to abolish\noctant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy.\n", "  Finite-volume modifications of the two-flavor chiral phase diagram are\ninvestigated within an effective quark-meson model in various mean-field\napproximations. The role of vacuum fluctuations and boundary conditions, their\ninfluence on higher cumulants and signatures of a possible pseudo-critical\nendpoint are amplified with smaller volumes.\n", "  We show that a Quark-Nova (QN; the explosive transition of a neutron star to\na quark star) occurring a few days following the supernova explosion of an\nOxygen-type Wolf-Rayet (WO) star can account for the intriguing features of\nASASSN-15lh, including its extreme energetics, its double-peaked light-curve\nand the evolution of its photospheric radius and temperature. A two-component\nconfiguration of the homologously expanding WO remnant (an extended envelope\nand a compact core) is used to harness the kinetic energy (>10^52 ergs) of the\nQN ejecta. The delay between the WO SN and the QN yields a large (~ 10^4 Rsun)\nenvelope which when energized by the QN ejecta/shock gives the first peak in\nour model. As the envelope's photosphere recedes into the slowly expanding, hot\nand insulated, denser core (initially heated by the QN shock) a second hump\nemerges. The spectrum in our model should reflect the composition of an WO SN\nremnant re-heated by a QN going off in its wake.\n", "  We study the properties of an electromagnetically interacting medium in the\npresence of high concentration of electrons at extremely high temperatures and\nchemical potentials. We show that the electromagnetic properties of a medium\nsuch as the electric permittivity, magnetic permeability, magnetic moments and\nthe propagation speed of electromagnetic waves as well as the corresponding\nparticle processes depend on temperature and density of the medium.\nElectromagnetic properties of neutrinos are significantly modified due to their\ninteractions with electrons when they propagate through such a medium of hot\nand dense electrons.\n", "  The Liouville equation for the q-deformed 1-D classical harmonic oscillator\nis derived for two definitions of q-deformation. This derivation is achieved by\nusing two different representations for the q-deformed Hamiltonian of this\noscillator corresponding to undeformed and deformed phase spaces. The resulting\nLiouville equation is solved by using the method of characteristics in order to\nobtain the classical probability distribution function for this system. The 2-D\nand 3-D behaviors of this function are then investigated using a computer\nvisualization method. The results are compared with those for the classical\nanharmonic oscillator. This comparison reveals that there are some similarities\nbetween these two models, where the results for the q-deformed oscillator\nexhibit similar whorl shapes that evolve with time as for the anharmonic\noscillator. It is concluded that studying the Liouville dynamics gives more\ndetails about the physical nature of q-deformation than using the equation of\nmotion method. It is also concluded that this result could have reflections on\nthe interpretation of the quantized version of this q-deformed oscillator.\n", "  We calculate the predicted width for the radiative decay of a $1^{++}$ heavy\nmeson via the channel $1^{++} \\to 1^{--} +\\gamma$ in the covariant light-front\nquark model. Specifically, we compute the decay widths for $\\chi_{c1}(1P) \\to\nJ/\\psi + \\gamma$ and $\\chi_{b1}(nP) \\to \\Upsilon(n'S) + \\gamma$. The results\nare compared with experimental data and with predictions from calculations\nbased on nonrelativistic models and their extensions to include relativistic\neffects.\n", "  The qualitative properties of the particle trajectories of the $N$-solitons\nsolution of the KdV equation are recovered from the first order velocity field\nby the introduction of the stream function. Numerical simulations show an\naccurate depth dependance of the particles trajectories for solitary waves.\nFailure of the free surface kinematic boundary condition for the first order\ntype velocity field is highlighted.\n", "  This work is focused on the study of early time cosmology and in particular\non the study of inflation. After an introduction on the standard Big Bang\ntheory, we discuss the physics of CMB and we explain how its observations can\nbe used to set constraints on cosmological models. We introduce inflation and\nwe carry out its simplest realization by presenting the observables and the\nexperimental constraints that can be set on inflationary models. The\npossibility of observing primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during\ninflation is discussed. We present the reasons to define a classification of\ninflationary models and introduce the \\beta-function formalism for inflation by\nexplaining why in this framework we can naturally define a set of universality\nclasses for inflationary models. Theoretical motivations to support the\nformulation of inflation in terms of this formalism are presented. Some\ngeneralized models of inflation are introduced and the extension of the\n\\beta-function formalism for inflation to these models is discussed. Finally we\nfocus on the study of models where the (pseudo-scalar) inflaton is coupled to\nsome Abelian gauge fields that can be present during inflation. The analysis of\nthe problem is carried out by using a characterization of inflationary models\nin terms of their asymptotic behavior. A wide set of theoretical aspects and of\nobservational consequences is discussed.\n", "  We use mid-IR to UV observations to derive a mean attenuation curve out to\nthe rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for \"BAL dust\" -- the dust causing the\nadditional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption\nlines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN\nattenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We\nconfirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700\n\\AA, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than\npredicted. The identical attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs)\ndoes not support them being a \"break out\" phase in the life of AGNs. Although\nattenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low ($E(B-V) \\sim 0.03 - 0.05$),\nthe attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep\nextinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for\nradiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution\nof AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the\ndust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative\nattenuation curve in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more\nlight scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We\nsuggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves\nappear to be steeper in the UV that an SMC curve.\n", "  A method for simulation of elastoplastic solids in multibody systems with\nnonsmooth and multidomain dynamics is developed. The solid is discretised into\npseudo-particles using the meshfree moving least squares method. The particles\ncarry strain and stress tensor variables that are mapped to deformation\nconstraints and constraint forces. The discretised solid model thus fit a\nunified framework for nonsmooth multidomain dynamics for realtime simulations\nincluding strong coupling of rigid multibodies with complex kinematic\nconstraints such as articulation joints, unilateral contacts with dry friction,\ndrivelines and hydraulics. The nonsmooth formulation allow for impulses, due to\nimpacts for instance, to propagate instantly between the rigid multibody and\nthe solid. Plasticity is introduced through an associative perfectly plastic\nmodified Drucker-Prager model. The elastic and plastic dynamics is verified for\nsimple test systems and the capability of simulating tracked terrain vehicles\ndriving on a deformable terrain is demonstrated.\n", "  The conjecture, that the finite volume corrections to the thermodynamic\nfunctions can be correctly reproduced by using the thermodynamic limit with low\nparticle momenta cutoff is examined in a very transparent example of an ideal\nboson gas in one dimension.\n  We show that this conjecture is always true in principle, and derive\nconvenient relations for the momentum cutoff dependence on thermal parameters\nin the asymptotic limits of large and small volume.\n", "  Often quantum systems are not isolated and interactions with their\nenvironments must be taken into account. In such open quantum systems these\nenvironmental interactions can lead to decoherence and dissipation, which have\na marked influence on the properties of the quantum system. In many instances\nthe environment is well-approximated by classical mechanics, so that one is led\nto consider the dynamics of open quantum-classical systems. Since a full\nquantum dynamical description of large many-body systems is not currently\nfeasible, mixed quantum-classical methods can provide accurate and\ncomputationally tractable ways to follow the dynamics of both the system and\nits environment. This review focuses on quantum-classical Liouville dynamics,\none of several quantum-classical descriptions, and discusses the problems that\narise when one attempts to combine quantum and classical mechanics, coherence\nand decoherence in quantum-classical systems, nonadiabatic dynamics,\nsurface-hopping and mean-field theories and their relation to quantum-classical\nLiouville dynamics, as well as methods for simulating the dynamics.\n", "  Discerning the nature of open cluster candidates is essential for both\nindividual and statistical analyses of cluster properties. Here we establish\nthe nature of thirteen cluster candidates from the FSR cluster list using\nphotometry from the 2MASS and deeper, higher resolution UKIDSS-GPS and\nVISTA-VVV surveys. These clusters were selected because they were flagged in\nour previous studies as expected to contain a large proportion of pre-main\nsequence members or are at unusually small/large Galactocentric distances. We\nemploy a decontamination procedure of JHK photometry to identify cluster\nmembers. Cluster properties are homogeneously determined and we conduct a cross\ncomparative study of our results with the literature (where available). Seven\nof the here studied clusters were confirmed to contain PMS stars, one of which\nis a newly confirmed cluster. Our study of FSR1716 is the deepest to date and\nis in notable disagreement with previous studies, finding that it has a\ndistance of about 7.3kpc and age of 10-12Gyr. As such, we argue that this\ncluster is a potential globular cluster candidate.\n", "  We prove long-term regularity of solutions of the one-fluid Euler-Maxwell\nsystem in 3 spatial dimensions, in the case of small initial data with\nnontrivial vorticity.\n", "  Various unique physical, chemical, mechanical and electronic properties of\ncarbon nanotube (CNT) make it very useful materials for diverse potential\napplication in many fields. Experimentally synthesized CNTs are generally found\nin bundle geometry with a mixture of different chirality and present a unique\nchallenge to separate them. In this paper we have proposed the PAMAM dendrimer\nto be an ideal candidate for this separation. To estimate efficiency of the\ndendrimer in dispersion of CNTs from the bundle geometry, we have calculated\npotential of mean forces (PMF). Our PMF study of two dendrimer wrapped CNTs\nshows lesser binding affinity compared to the two bare CNTs. PMF study shows\nthat the binding affinity decreases for non-protonated dendrimer and for the\nprotonated case, the interaction is fully repulsive in nature. For both the\nnon-protonated as well as protonated cases, the PMF increases with increasing\ndendrimer generations from 2 to 4 gradually compare to the bare PMF. We have\nperformed PMF calculations with (6,5) and (6,6) chirality to study the\nchirality dependence of PMF. Calculated PMF for protonated dendrimer wrapped\nchiral CNTs is more compared to the protonated dendrimer wrapped armchair CNTs\nfor all the generations studied. However, for non-protonated dendrimer wrapped\nCNTs such chirality dependence is not very prominent. Our study suggests that\nthe dispersion efficiency of protonated dendrimer is more compared to the\nnon-protonated dendrimer and can be used as an effective dispersing agent in\ndispersion of CNT from the bundle geometry.\n", "  Saturn's Great Storm of 2010 - 2011 produced a planet-encircling wake that\nslowly transitioned from a region that was mainly dark at 5 microns in February\n2011 to a region that was almost entirely bright and remarkably uniform by\nDecember of 2012. The uniformity and high emission levels suggested that the\nentire wake region had been cleared not only of the ammonia clouds that the\nstorm had generated and exposed, but also of any other aerosols that might\nprovide significant blocking of the thermal emission from Saturn's deeper and\nwarmer atmospheric layers. Our analysis of VIMS wake spectra from December 2012\nprovides no evidence of ammonia ice absorption, but shows that at least one\nsignificant cloud layer remained behind: a non-absorbing layer of 3 - 4 optical\ndepths (at 2 microns) extending from 150 to ~400 mbar. A second layer of\nabsorbing and scattering particles, with less than 1 optical depth and located\nnear 1 bar, is also suggested, but its existence as a model requirement depends\non what value of the He/H2 ratio is assumed. The observations can be fit well\nwith just a single (upper) cloud layer for a He/H2 ratio of 0.064 in\ncombination with a PH3 deep volume mixing ratio of 5 ppm. At lower He/H2\nratios, the observed spectra can be modeled without particles in this region.\nAt higher ratios, in order to fit the brightest wake spectrum, models must\ninclude either significant cloud opacity in this region, or significantly\nincreased absorption by PH3, NH3, and AsH3. As the exceptional horizontal\nuniformity in the late wake is most easily understood as a complete removal of\na deep cloud layer, and after considering independent constraints on trace gas\nmixing ratios, we conclude that the existence of this remarkable wake\nuniformity is most consistent with a He/H2 mixing ratio of 0.055 (+0.010,\n-0.015), which is on the low side of the 0.038 - 0.135 range of previous\nestimates.\n", "  After the initial stage of fast expanding of the hot Universe comes epoch of\ntemperature fall and subsequent formation of dense clouds of hydrogen. Due to\nprocess of accretion some of this clouds became compact objects. Initially\naccretion is spherical, but then take the shape of the disk, and this 2D disk\ncollect matter more efficient than 3D sphere. Accretion disks provide the\nmechanism of redistribution of angular moment and extraction of potential\nenergy,leads to occurrence of compact objects from gas clouds. To fall moving\nalong a spiral trajectory on the central gravitating body, a particle rotation\naround must reduce angular moment and energy. Outward of angular moment and\nmovement of gas particles in the opposite direction (to the central body)\nhappens due to of viscose friction. We can think that the disc is composed of\nmultiple adjacent rings friction each other, each inner ring has a large\nangular velocity to the adjacent outer ring and thus friction of the drive ring\ndecreased the rate of internal. The occurrence of intense dissipation in\naccretion flows is among the long-standing unsolved problems in astrophysics.\nRevealing how the magnetized turbulence creates shear stress tensor is of\nprimary importance to understand the heating mechanism and the transport of\nangular momentum in accretion disks. The transport of angular momentum at\ngreatly enhanced rates is important for the main problem of cosmogony, that is\nunderstanding the dynamics of creation of compact astrophysical objects.\nWithout a theory explaining the enhanced energy dissipation in accretion flows\nof turbulent magnetized plasma we would have no clear picture of how our solar\nsystem has been created, why the angular momentum of the Sun is only 2% of the\nangular momentum of solar system, while carrying 99% of the solar system's\nmass.\n", "  We apply hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) to investigate the\nelectronic structures in ~50-nm thick epitaxial GaP layers grown on Si(001)\nunder different conditions. Depth profiles of the local binding energies for\nthe core levels are obtained by measuring the photoemission spectra at\ndifferent incident photon energies between 3 and 7 keV and analyzing them with\nsimple numerical models. The obtained depth profiles are in quantitative\nagreement with the band bending determinations for the same samples in a\nprevious coherent phonon spectroscopic study. Our results demonstrate the\napplicability of the HAXPES with varying incident photon energy to characterize\nthe electric potential profiles at buried semiconductor heterointerfaces.\n", "  We present an algorithm that takes a CSS stabilizer code as input, and\noutputs another CSS stabilizer code such that the stabilizer generators all\nhave weights $O(1)$ and such that $O(1)$ generators act on any given qubit. The\nnumber of logical qubits is unchanged by the procedure, while we give bounds on\nthe increase in number of physical qubits and in the effect on distance and\nother code parameters, such as soundness (as a locally testable code) and\n\"cosoundness\" (defined later). Applications are discussed, including to codes\nfrom high-dimensional manifolds which have logarithmic weight stabilizers.\nAssuming a conjecture in geometry\\cite{hdm}, this allows the construction of\nCSS stabilizer codes with generator weight $O(1)$ and almost linear distance.\nAnother application of the construction is to increasing the distance to $X$ or\n$Z$ errors, whichever is smaller, so that the two distances are equal.\n", "  The latest results from the Twisted-Mass collaboration on disconnected\ndiagrams at the physical value of the pion mass are presented. In particular,\nwe focus on the sigma terms, the axial charges and the momentum fraction, all\nof them for the nucleon. A detailed error analysis for each observable follows,\nshowing the strengths and weaknesses of the one-end trick. Alternatives are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Modern advances in polarized beam control should make it possible to\naccurately measure Stern-Gerlach (S-G) deflection of relativistic beams. Toward\nthis end a relativistically covariant S-G formalism is developed that respects\nthe opposite behavior under inversion of electric and magnetic fields. Not at\nall radical, or even new, this introduces a distinction between electric and\nmagnetic fields that is not otherwise present in pure Maxwell theory.\nExperimental configurations (mainly using polarized electron beams passing\nthrough magnetic or electric quadrupoles) are described. Electron beam\npreparation and experimental methods needed to detect the extremely small\ndeflections are discussed.\n", "  We make a change of variable in the standard model Higgs field by a fermion\noperator and show that the latter is responsible for the electroweak vacuum. By\ncomputing the vacuum expectation value of this fermion operator in the path\nintegral formalism we determine a relation among the quark vacuum condensates,\nthe quark masses and the intrinsic scale of the theory. We show that the heavy\nquark vacuum condensates do not justify the hypothesis of dynamical electroweak\nsymmetry breaking with only standard model fermions.\n", "  For each $\\alpha \\in \\{0,1,-1\\}$, we count alternating sign matrices that are\ninvariant under reflections in the diagonal and in the antidiagonal (DASASMs)\nof fixed odd order with a maximal number of $\\alpha$'s along the diagonal and\nthe antidiagonal, as well as DASASMs of fixed odd order with a minimal number\nof $0$'s along the diagonal and the antidiagonal. In these enumerations, we\nencounter product formulas that have previously appeared in plane partition or\nalternating sign matrix counting, namely for the number of all alternating sign\nmatrices, the number of cyclically symmetric plane partitions in a given box,\nand the number of vertically and horizontally symmetric ASMs. We also prove\nseveral refinements. For instance, in the case of DASASMs with a maximal number\nof $-1$'s along the diagonal and the antidiagonal, these considerations lead\nnaturally to the definition of alternating sign triangles which are new objects\nthat are equinumerous with ASMs, and we are able to prove a two parameter\nrefinement of this fact, involving the number of $-1$'s and the inversion\nnumber on the ASM side. To prove our results, we extend techniques to deal with\ntriangular six-vertex configurations that have recently successfully been\napplied to settle Robbins' conjecture on the number of all DASASMs of odd\norder. Importantly, we use a general solution of the reflection equation to\nprove the symmetry of the partition function in the spectral parameters. In all\nof our cases, we derive determinant or Pfaffian formulas for the partition\nfunctions, which we then specialize in order to obtain the product formulas for\nthe various classes of extreme odd DASASMs under consideration.\n", "  The high-precision HERA data allow searches for up to TeV scales \"Beyond the\nStandard Model\" contributions to electron-quark scattering. Combined H1 and\nZEUS measurements of inclusive deep inelastic cross sections in neutral and\ncharged current ep scattering are considered, corresponding to a luminosity of\naround 1 fb$^{-1}$. A new approach to the beyond the Standard Model analysis of\nthe inclusive $ep$ data is presented; simultaneous fits of parton distribution\nfunctions and contributions of \"new physics\" processes are performed.\nConsidered are possible deviations from the Standard Model due to a finite\nradius of quarks, described within the quark form-factor model, and due to new\nelectron-quark interactions in the framework of $eeqq$ contact interactions\n(CI). The resulting 95% C.L. upper limit on the effective quark radius is\n$0.43\\cdot 10^{-16}$ cm. The limits on the CI mass scale extend up to 10 TeV\ndepending on the CI scenario.\n", "  Though John Bell had claimed that his spin-1/2 example of a hidden-variable\ntheory(HV) is an \\emph{explicit} counterexample to von Neumann's proof of the\nnon-existence of hidden variable theories empirically equivalent to quantum\nmechanics, such examples can be so construed only if they met all of von\nNeumann's requirements. In particular, that they reproduced all the observed\npredictions of quantum theory. To shed light on these aspects, we have, on the\none hand, simplified and critically examined Bell's original example and on the\nother hand, constructed explicit such examples for spin-1 systems. We have\nclarified the relation of our example to the Kochen-Specker and Bell's powerful\nearlier results. Our spin-1 examples are manifestly non-contextual, yet\nviolating the K-S constraints configuration by configuration. Nevertheless,\nthey reproduce the correct quantum expectation values and variances for\narbitrary linear combinations of the beables in one case, and for close\napproximants to the beables representing K-S constraints. In conformity with\nthe K-S theorem, the variance of the K-S constraint is nonzero. The\nimplications of this non-vanishing variance are analysed in detail. In the\nother example, we show how this variance can be made arbitrarily small but not\nzero.\n", "  Frustration is a powerful mechanism in condensed matter systems, driving both\norder and co plexity. In smectics, the frustration between macroscopic\nchirality and equally spaced layers generates textures characterised by a\nproliferation of defects. In this article, we study several different ground\nstates of the chiral Landau-de Gennes free energy for a smectic liquid crystal.\nThe standard theory finds the twist grain boundary (TGB) phase to be the ground\nstate for chiral type II smectics. However, for very highly chiral systems, the\nhierarchical helical nanofilament (HN) phase can form and is stable over the\nTGB.\n", "  By definition, Manufactured turbulence(MT) is purported to mimic physical\nturbulence rather than model it. The MT equations are constrained to be simple\nto solve and provide an inexpensive surrogate to Navier-Stokes based Direct\nNumerical Simulations (DNS) for use in engineering applications or theoretical\nanalyses. In this article, we investigate one approach in which the linear\ninviscid aspects of MT are derived from a linear approximation of the\nNavier-Stokes equations while the non-linear and viscous physics are\napproximated via stochastic modeling. The ensuing Langevin MT equations are\nused to compute planar, quadratic turbulent flows. While much work needs to be\ndone, the preliminary results appear promising.\n", "  We calculate small correction terms to gravitational potential near\n$p$-branes embedded in a constant NS $B$ field background in the context of\nM-theory or string theory. The normalizable wave functions of gravity\nfluctuations around the brane describe only massive modes. We compute such wave\nfunctions analytically. We estimate the correction to gravitational potential\nfor small and long distances, and show that there is an intermediate range of\ndistances in which we can identify $4D$ gravity on the brane below a crossover\nscale given in terms of components of the $B$ field. The $4D$ gravity is\nmetastable and for distances much larger than the crossover scale the $5D$\ngravity is recovered.\n", "  Stars that are collapsing toward forming a black hole but appear frozen near\ntheir Schwarzschild horizon are termed \"black stars\". The collision of two\nblack stars leads to gravitational radiation during the merging phase followed\nby a delayed gamma ray burst during coalescence. The recent observation of\ngravitational waves by LIGO, followed by a possible gamma ray counterpart by\nFermi, suggests that the source may have been a merger of two black stars with\nprofound implications for quantum gravity and the nature of black holes.\n"]}
