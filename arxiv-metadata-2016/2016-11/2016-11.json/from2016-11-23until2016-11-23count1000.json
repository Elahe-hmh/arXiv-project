The dipole matrix of complicated cubic cell could be\nsimplified into the form of dipole Matrix of simple cubic cells. This study was\nconfined only to the highly oriented thin films of ferrite. The variation of\ntotal energy of Nickel ferrite thin films with angle and number of layers was\ninvestigated. Also the change of energy with stress induced anisotropy for\nNickel ferrite films with N=5 and 1000 has been studied. Films with the\nmagnetic moments ratio 1.86 can be easily oriented in 90 direction when N is\ngreater than 400.\n", "  We apply the mathematical technique of factorization of differential\noperators to two different problems. First we review our results related to the\nsupersymmetry of the Montroll kinks moving onto the microtubule walls as well\nas mentioning the sine-Gordon model for the microtubule nonlinear excitations.\nSecond, we find analytic expressions for a class of one-parameter solutions of\na sort of diffusion equation of Bessel type that is obtained by supersymmetry\nfrom the homogeneous form of a simple damped wave equations derived in the\nworks of P.A. Robinson and collaborators for the corticothalamic system. We\nalso present a possible interpretation of the diffusion equation in the brain\ncontext\n", "  The International Linear Collider (ILC) is the next large scale project in\naccelerator particle physics. Colliding electrons with positrons at energies\nfrom 0.3 TeV up to about 1 TeV, the ILC is expected to provide the accuracy\nneeded to complement the LHC data and extend the sensitivity to new phenomena\nat the high energy frontier and answer some of the fundamental questions in\nparticle physics and in its relation to Cosmology. This paper reviews some\nhighlights of the ILC physics program and some of the major challenges for the\naccelerator and detector design.\n", "  This Chapter contains a review of the recent results, both experimental and\ntheoretical, related to optical control of carriers confined in semiconductor\nquantum dots. The physics of Rabi oscillations of exciton and biexciton\noccupations, as well as time-domain interference experiments are discussed.\nNext, the impact of carrier--phonon interaction in a semiconductor structure is\ndescribed and modern methods of theoretical description of the carrier--phonon\nkinetics and of the resulting dephasing are presented.\n", "  Alternative versions of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in a curved\nspacetime are got by applying directly the classical-quantum correspondence.\n", "  A review of the present state of investigations of the pseudospin-electron\nmodel (PEM), which is used in the theory of strongly correlated electron\nsystems, is given. The model is used to describe the systems with the locally\nanharmonic elements of structure represented in the model by pseudospins. The\nconsideration is based on the dynamical mean field theory approach and the\ngeneralized random phase approximation. Electron spectrum and thermodynamics of\nthe model are investigated; the cases of the simplified model, the model with\nstrong interaction and the two-sublattice model are studied more in detail. The\nphase transitions into other uniform or modulated states as well as\nsuperconducting phases are described; the criteria of their realization are\nestablished. Based on this, the description of structural and dielectric\n(ferroelectric type) instabilities, phase separation and bistability phenomena\nis given. A comparison is made with the thermodynamics of the Falicov-Kimball\nmodel (which can be considered as a particular case of PEM). The possibility of\napplying the PEM to the analysis of thermodynamics of the real HTSC systems is\ndiscussed. Attention is paid to the unsolved problems in the study of PEM.\n", "  The concept of superintegrability in quantum mechanics is extended to the\ncase of a particle with spin s=1/2 interacting with one of spin s=0.\nNon-trivial superintegrable systems with 8- and 9-dimensional Lie algebras of\nfirst-order integrals of motion are constructed in two- and three-dimensional\nspaces, respectively.\n", "  The problem of emergence in physical theories makes necessary to build a\ngeneral theory of the relationships between the observed system and the\nobserving system. It can be shown that there exists a correspondence between\nclassical systems and computational dynamics according to the Shannon-Turing\nmodel. A classical system is an informational closed system with respect to the\nobserver; this characterizes the emergent processes in classical physics as\nphenomenological emergence. In quantum systems, the analysis based on the\ncomputation theory fails. It is here shown that a quantum system is an\ninformational open system with respect to the observer and able to exhibit\nprocesses of observational, radical emergence. Finally, we take into\nconsideration the role of computation in describing the physical world.\n", "  We develop a new approach to the theoretical treatment of the separatrix\nchaos, using a special analysis of the separatrix map. The approach allows us\nto describe boundaries of the separatrix chaotic layer in the Poincar\\'{e}\nsection and transport within the layer. We show that the maximum which the\nwidth of the layer in energy takes as the perturbation frequency varies is much\nlarger than the perturbation amplitude, in contrast to predictions by earlier\ntheories suggesting that the maximum width is of the order of the amplitude.\nThe approach has also allowed us to develop the self-consistent theory of the\nearlier discovered (PRL 90, 174101 (2003)) drastic facilitation of the onset of\nglobal chaos between adjacent separatrices. Simulations agree with the theory.\n", "  We study the phase space dynamics of multi--dimensional symplectic maps,\nusing the method of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI). In particular, we\ninvestigate the behavior of the GALI for a system of N=3 coupled standard maps\nand show that it provides an efficient criterion for rapidly distinguishing\nbetween regular and chaotic motion.\n", "  Systems with long-range interactions display a short-time relaxation towards\nQuasi-Stationary States (QSSs), whose lifetime increases with system size. With\nreference to the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, we here review\nLynden-Bell's theory of ``violent relaxation''. The latter results in a maximum\nentropy scheme for a water-bag initial profile which predicts the presence of\nout-of-equilibrium phase transitions} separating homogeneous (zero\nmagnetization) from inhomogeneous (non-zero magnetization) QSSs. Two different\nparametric representations of the initial condition are analyzed and the\nfeatures of the phase diagram are discussed. In both representations we find a\nsecond order and a first order line of phase transitions that merge at a\ntricritical point. Particular attention is payed to the condition of existence\nand stability of the homogenous phase.\n", "  We propose a theory to explain the formation of both spirals and rings in\nbarred galaxies using a common dynamical framework. It is based on the orbital\nmotion driven by the unstable equilibrium points of the rotating bar potential.\nThus, spirals, rings and pseudo-rings are related to the invariant manifolds\nassociated to the periodic orbits around these equilibrium points. We examine\nthe parameter space of three barred galaxy models and discuss the formation of\nthe different morphological structures according to the properties of the bar\nmodel. We also study the influence of the shape of the rotation curve in the\nouter parts, by making families of models with rising, flat or falling rotation\ncurves in the outer parts. The differences between spiral and ringed structures\narise from differences in the dynamical parameters of the host galaxies.\n", "  A non-technical discussion of the naturalness criterion and its implications\nfor new physics searches at the LHC. To be published in the book \"LHC\nPerspectives\", edited by G. Kane and A. Pierce.\n", "  Super-Kamiokande is a 50 kiloton water Cherenkov detector located at the\nKamioka Observatory of the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of\nTokyo. It was designed to study neutrino oscillations and carry out searches\nfor the decay of the nucleon. The Super-Kamiokande experiment began in 1996 and\nin the ensuing decade of running has produced extremely important results in\nthe fields of atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations, along with setting\nstringent limits on the decay of the nucleon and the existence of dark matter\nand astrophysical sources of neutrinos. Perhaps most crucially,\nSuper-Kamiokande for the first time definitively showed that neutrinos have\nmass and undergo flavor oscillations. This chapter will summarize the published\nscientific output of the experiment with a particular emphasis on the\natmospheric neutrino results.\n", "  We present a method of control of chaos in area-preserving maps. This method\ngives an explicit expression of a control term which is added to a given\narea-preserving map. The resulting controlled map which is a small and suitable\nmodification of the original map, is again area-preserving and has an invariant\ncurve whose equation is explicitly known.\n", "  We consider a generalized class of Keller-Segel models describing the\nchemotaxis of biological populations (bacteria, amoebae, endothelial cells,\nsocial insects,...). We show the analogy with nonlinear mean field\nFokker-Planck equations and generalized thermodynamics. As an illustration, we\nintroduce a new model of chemotaxis incorporating both effects of anomalous\ndiffusion and exclusion principle (volume filling). We also discuss the analogy\nbetween biological populations described by the Keller-Segel model and\nself-gravitating Brownian particles described by the Smoluchowski-Poisson\nsystem.\n", "  In this paper we report on the data recorded with the first Antares detector\nline. The line was deployed on the 14th of February 2006 and was connected to\nthe readout two weeks later. Environmental data for one and a half years of\nrunning are shown. Measurements of atmospheric muons from data taken from\nselected runs during the first six months of operation are presented.\nPerformance figures in terms of time residuals and angular resolution are\ngiven. Finally the angular distribution of atmospheric muons is presented and\nfrom this the depth profile of the muon intensity is derived.\n", "  The Jordan-Wigner transformation is known as a powerful tool in condensed\nmatter theory, especially in the theory of low-dimensional quantum spin\nsystems. The aim of this chapter is to review the application of the\nJordan-Wigner fermionization technique for calculating dynamic quantities of\nlow-dimensional quantum spin models. After a brief introduction of the\nJordan-Wigner transformation for one-dimensional spin one-half systems and some\nof its extensions for higher dimensions and higher spin values we focus on the\ndynamic properties of several low-dimensional quantum spin models. We start\nfrom the famous s=1/2 XX chain. As a first step we recall well-known results\nfor dynamics of the z-spin-component fluctuation operator and then turn to the\ndynamics of the dimer and trimer fluctuation operators. The dynamics of the\ntrimer fluctuations involves both the two-fermion (one particle and one hole)\nand the four-fermion (two particles and two holes) excitations. We discuss some\nproperties of the two-fermion and four-fermion excitation continua. The\nfour-fermion dynamic quantities are of intermediate complexity between simple\ntwo-fermion (like the zz dynamic structure factor) and enormously complex\nmulti-fermion (like the xx or xy dynamic structure factors) dynamic quantities.\nFurther we discuss the effects of dimerization, anisotropy of XY interaction,\nand additional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on various dynamic quantities.\nFinally we consider the dynamic transverse spin structure factor\n$S_{zz}({\\bf{k}},\\omega)$ for the s=1/2 XX model on a spatially anisotropic\nsquare lattice which allows one to trace a one-to-two-dimensional crossover in\ndynamic quantities.\n", "  Shear-free or asymptotically shear-free null geodesic congruences possess a\nlarge number of fascinating geometric properties and to be closely related, in\nthe context of general relativity, to a variety of physically significant\naffects. It is the purpose of this paper to develop these issues and find\napplications in GR. The applications center around the problem of extracting\ninterior physical properties of an asymptotically flat space-time directly from\nthe asymptotic gravitational (and Maxwell) field itself in analogy with the\ndetermination of total charge by an integral over the Maxwell field at infinity\nor the identification of the interior mass (and its loss) by (Bondi's)\nintegrals of the Weyl tensor, also at infinity. More specifically we will see\nthat the asymptotically shear-free congruences lead us to an asymptotic\ndefinition of the center-of-mass and its equations of motion. This includes a\nkinematic meaning, in terms of the center of mass motion, for the Bondi\nthree-momentum. In addition, we obtain insights into intrinsic spin and, in\ngeneral, angular momentum, including an angular momentum conservation law with\nwell-defined flux terms. When a Maxwell field is present the asymptotically\nshear-free congruences allow us to determine/define at infinity a\ncenter-of-charge world-line and intrinsic magnetic dipole moment.\n", "  In a previous publication (Richichi & Percheron 2005) we described a program\nof observations of candidate calibrator stars at the ESO Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer (VLTI), and presented the main results from a statistical point\nof view. In the present paper, we concentrate on establishing a new homogeneous\ngroup of bright interferometric calibrators, based entirely on publicly\navailable K-band VLTI observations carried out with the VINCI instrument up to\nJuly 2004. For this, we have defined a number of selection criteria for the\nquality and volume of the observations, and we have accordingly selected a list\nof 17 primary and 47 secondary calibrators. We have developed an approach to a\nrobust global fit for the angular diameters using the whole volume of\nquality-controlled data, largely independent of a priori assumptions. Our\nresults have been compared with direct measurements, and indirect estimates\nbased on spectrophotometric methods, and general agreement is found within the\ncombined uncertainties. The stars in our list cover the range K=-2.9 to +3.0\nmag in brightness, and 1.3 to 20.5 milliarcseconds in uniform-disk diameter.\nThe relative accuracy of the angular diameter values is on average 0.4% and 2%\nfor the primary and secondary calibrators respectively. Our calibrators are\nwell suited for interferometric observations in the near-infrared on baselines\nbetween ~20m and ~200m, and their accuracy is superior, at least for the\nprimary calibrators, to other similar catalogues. Therefore, the present list\nof calibrators has the potential to lead to significantly improved\ninterferometric scientific results.\n", "  We study the abundance of CCH in prestellar cores both because of its role in\nthe chemistry and because it is a potential probe of the magnetic field. We\nalso consider the non-LTE behaviour of the N=1-0 and N=2-1 transitions of CCH\nand improve current estimates of the spectroscopic constants of CCH. We used\nthe IRAM 30m radiotelescope to map the N=1-0 and N=2-1 transitions of CCH\ntowards the prestellar cores L1498 and CB246. Towards CB246, we also mapped the\n1.3 mm dust emission, the J=1-0 transition of N2H+ and the J=2-1 transition of\nC18O. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer program to analyse the CCH\nobservations of L1498. We derived the distribution of CCH column densities and\ncompared with the H2 column densities inferred from dust emission. We find that\nwhile non-LTE intensity ratios of different components of the N=1-0 and N=2-1\nlines are present, they are of minor importance and do not impede CCH column\ndensity determinations based upon LTE analysis. Moreover, the comparison of our\nMonte-Carlo calculations with observations suggest that the non-LTE deviations\ncan be qualitatively understood. For L1498, our observations in conjunction\nwith the Monte Carlo code imply a CCH depletion hole of radius 9 x 10^{16} cm\nsimilar to that found for other C-containing species. We briefly discuss the\nsignificance of the observed CCH abundance distribution. Finally, we used our\nobservations to provide improved estimates for the rest frequencies of all six\ncomponents of the CCH(1-0) line and seven components of CCH(2-1). Based on\nthese results, we compute improved spectroscopic constants for CCH. We also\ngive a brief discussion of the prospects for measuring magnetic field strengths\nusing CCH.\n", "  The perturbations of chirped dissipative solitons are analyzed in the\nspectral domain. It is shown, that the structure of the perturbed chirped\ndissipative soliton is highly nontrivial and has a tendency to an enhancement\nof the spectral perturbations especially at the spectrum edges, where the\nirregularities develop. Even spectrally localized perturbations spread over a\nwhole soliton spectrum. As a result of spectral irregularity, the chaotic\ndynamics develops due to the spectral loss action. In particular, the\ndissipative soliton can become fragmented though remains localized.\n", "  Much recent interest has focused on \"open\" dynamical systems, in which a\nclassical map or flow is considered only until the trajectory reaches a \"hole\",\nat which the dynamics is no longer considered. Here we consider questions\npertaining to the survival probability as a function of time, given an initial\nmeasure on phase space. We focus on the case of billiard dynamics, namely that\nof a point particle moving with constant velocity except for mirror-like\nreflections at the boundary, and give a number of recent results, physical\napplications and open problems.\n", "  To each three-component link in the 3-sphere, we associate a geometrically\nnatural characteristic map from the 3-torus to the 2-sphere, and show that the\npairwise linking numbers and Milnor triple linking number that classify the\nlink up to link homotopy correspond to the Pontryagin invariants that classify\nits characteristic map up to homotopy. This can be viewed as a natural\nextension of the familiar fact that the linking number of a two-component link\nin 3-space is the degree of its associated Gauss map from the 2-torus to the\n2-sphere. When the pairwise linking numbers are all zero, we give an integral\nformula for the triple linking number analogous to the Gauss integral for the\npairwise linking numbers. The integrand in this formula is geometrically\nnatural in the sense that it is invariant under orientation-preserving rigid\nmotions of the 3-sphere, while the integral itself can be viewed as the\nhelicity of a related vector field on the 3-torus.\n", "  We discuss some important issues arising from computational efforts in\ndynamical systems and fluid dynamics. Various individuals have misunderstood\nthese issues since the onset of these problem areas; indeed, they have been\nroutinely misinterpreted, and even viewed as \"laws\" by some. This paper hopes\nto stimulate appropriate corrections and to realign thinking, with the overall\ngoal being sound future progress in dynamical systems and fluid dynamics.\n", "  We discuss recent work with E.Floratos (JHEP 1004:036,2010) on Nambu Dynamics\nof Intersecting Surfaces underlying Dissipative Chaos in $R^{3}$. We present\nour argument for the well studied Lorenz and R\\\"{o}ssler strange attractors. We\nimplement a flow decomposition to their equations of motion. Their volume\npreserving part preserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so\ncalled {\\em Nambu Hamiltonians}. For dynamical systems with linear dissipative\nsector such as the Lorenz system, they are specified in terms of Intersecting\nQuadratic Surfaces. For the case of the R\\\"{o}ssler system, with nonlinear\ndissipative part, they are given in terms of a Helicoid intersected by a\nCylinder. In each case they foliate the entire phase space and get deformed by\nDissipation, the irrotational component to their flow. It is given by the\ngradient of a surface in $R^{3}$ specified in terms of a scalar function. All\nthree intersecting surfaces reproduce completely the dynamics of each strange\nattractor.\n", "  We explain how to construct matrix product stationary states which are\ncomposed of finite-dimensional matrices. Our construction explained in this\narticle was first presented in a part of [Hieida and Sasamoto:J. Phys. A: Math.\nGen. 37 (2004) 9873] for general models. In this article, we give more details\non the treatment than in the above-mentioned reference, for one-dimensional\nasymmetric simple exclusion process(ASEP).\n", "  We study the renormalization group flow for the Higgs self coupling in the\npresence of gravitational correction terms. We show that the resulting equation\nis equivalent to a singular linear ODE, which has explicit solutions in terms\nof hypergeometric functions. We discuss the implications of this model with\ngravitational corrections on the Higgs mass estimates in particle physics\nmodels based on the spectral action functional.\n", "  A description of the space of G-connections using the tangent groupoid is\ngiven. As the tangent groupoid parameter is away from zero, the G-connections\nact as convolution operators on a Hilbert space. The gauge action is examined\nin the tangent groupoid description of the G-connections. Tetrads are\nformulated as Dirac type operators. The connection variables and tetrad\nvariables in Ashtekar's gravity are presented as operators on a Hilbert space.\n", "  We show that the supermembrane theory compactified on a torus is invariant\nunder T-duality. There are two different topological sectors of the\ncompactified supermembrane (M2) classified according to a vanishing or\nnonvanishing second cohomology class. We find the explicit T-duality\ntransformation that acts locally on the supermembrane theory and we show that\nit is an exact symmetry of the theory. We give a global interpretation of the\nT-duality in terms of bundles. It has a natural description in terms of the\ncohomology of the base manifold and the homology of the target torus. We show\nthat in the limit when the torus degenerate into a circle and the M2 mass\noperator restricts to the string-like configurations, the usual closed string\nT-duality transformation between the type IIA and type IIB mass operators is\nrecovered. Moreover if we just restrict M2 mass operator to string-like\nconfigurations but we perform a generalized T-duality we find the SL(2,Z)\nnon-perturbative multiplet of IIA.\n", "  By returning to the underlying discrete time formalism, we relate spurious\nresults in coherent state path integral calculations to the high frequency\nstructure of their propagators. We show how to modify the standard expressions\nfor thermodynamic quantities to yield correct results. These expressions are\nrelevant to a broad range of physical problems, from the thermodynamics of Bose\nlattice gases to the dynamics of spin systems.\n", "  We present an embedding of the Tsallis entropy into the 3-dimensional\nHeisenberg group, in order to understand the meaning of generalized\nindependence as encoded in the Tsallis entropy composition property. We infer\nthat the Tsallis entropy composition induces fractal properties on the\nunderlying Euclidean space. Using a theorem of Milnor/Wolf/Tits/Gromov, we\njustify why the underlying configuration/phase space of systems described by\nthe Tsallis entropy has polynomial growth for both discrete and Riemannian\ncases. We provide a geometric framework that elucidates Abe's formula for the\nTsallis entropy, in terms the Pansu derivative of a map between sub-Riemannian\nspaces.\n", "  The associated production of a $J/{\\psi}$ and a $\\pi$-meson in\nantiproton-nucleon annihilation is studied in the framework of QCD collinear\nfactorization. In this approach, a hard subprocess responsible for the\nproduction of the heavy quark-antiquark pair factorizes from soft hadronic\nmatrix elements, such as the antiproton (nucleon) distribution amplitude and\nthe nucleon-to-pion (antiproton-to-pion) transition distribution amplitude.\nThis reaction mechanism should dominate the forward and backward kinematical\nregions, where the cross sections are expected to be measurable in the set-up\nof the PANDA experiment at the GSI-Fair facility.\n", "  Observational studies show that voids are prominent features of the large\nscale structure of the present day Universe. Even though their emerging from\nthe primordial density perturbations and evolutionary patterns differ from dark\nmatter halos, N-body simulations and theoretical models have shown that voids\nalso merge together to form large void structures. In this study, following\nSheth & van de Weygaert (2004), we formulate an analytical approximate\ndescription of the hierarchical void evolution of growing voids by adopting the\nhalo merging algorithm given by Lacey & Cole (1993) in the Einstein de Sitter\n(EdS) Universe. To do this, we take into account the general volume\ndistribution of voids which consists of two main void processes: merging and\ncollapsing. We show that the volume distribution function can be reduced to a\nsimple form, by neglecting the collapsing void contribution since the collapse\nprocess is negligible for large size voids. Therefore, the void volume fraction\nhas a contribution only from growing voids. This algorithm becomes the analogue\nof the halo merging algorithm. Based on this growing void distribution, we\nobtain the void merging algorithm in which we define and formulate void merging\nand absorption rates, as well as void size and redshift survival probabilities\nand also failure rates in terms of the self similar and currently favored dark\nenergy dominated cold dark matter models in the EdS Universe.\n", "  We use an exact solution of the elastic membrane shape equation, representing\nthe curvature, which will serve as a quantum potential in the quantum\nmechanical two dimensional Schrodinger equation for a (quasi-) particle on the\nsurface of the membrane. Surface curvature in the quasi one-dimensional case is\nrelated to an unexpected static formation: on one hand the elastic energy has a\nmaximum where surface curvature has a maximum and on the other hand the\nconcentration of the expectation value to find the (quasi-) particle is again\nwhere the elastic energy is concentrated, namely where surface curvature has a\nmaximum. This represents a particular form of a conformon.\n", "  We present an open system interaction formalism for the Dirac equation.\nOvercoming a complexity bottleneck of alternative formulations, our framework\nenables efficient numerical simulations (utilizing a typical desktop) of\nrelativistic dynamics within the von Neumann density matrix and Wigner phase\nspace descriptions. Employing these instruments, we gain important insights\ninto the effect of quantum dephasing for relativistic systems in many branches\nof physics. In particular, the conditions for robustness of Majorana spinors\nagainst dephasing are established. Using the Klein paradox and tunneling as\nexamples, we show that quantum dephasing does not suppress negative energy\nparticle generation. Hence, the Klein dynamics is also robust to dephasing.\n", "  We calculate the one-loop effective potential of a scalar field in a\nRobertson-Walker background with scalar metric perturbations. A complete set of\northonormal solutions of the perturbed equations is obtained by using the\nadiabatic approximation for comoving observers. After analyzing the problem of\nrenormalization in inhomogeneous backgrounds, we get the explicit contribution\nof metric perturbations to the effective potential. We apply these results to\nthe Standard Model Higgs field and evaluate the effects of metric perturbations\non the Higgs mass and on its vacuum expectation value. Space-time variations\nare found, which are proportional to the gravitational slip parameter, with a\ntypical amplitude of the order of $\\Delta\\phi/\\phi\\simeq 10^{-11}$ on\ncosmological scales. We also discuss possible astrophysical signatures in the\nSolar System and in the Milky Way that could open new possibilities to explore\nthe symmetry breaking sector of the electroweak interactions.\n", "  We consider the enhanced mixing due to multiple cylinders organised in\nschools moving synchronously in a potential flow. Here simple interactions\nbetween cylinders are modelled by the method of image doublets. This is an\nextension to Thiffeault \\& Childress's work [\\emph{Physics Letters A}\n\\textbf{374}, 3487 (2010)] where fluid particle displacements due to\nnon-interacting swimmers were analysed to produce an effective diffusivity that\nmay have a significant impact in ocean mixing. Our results show that schools of\ntwo cylinders induce nonlinearly boosted diffusivity compared with the\nnon-interacting case for general configuration parameters, except when they\nmove along a straight line with small separation. We attribute this phenomenon\nto two different physical mechanisms via which interacting cylinders cooperate\nto generate long particle drifts depending on their formation. Finally, the\neffective diffusivity of schools of three or more cylinders in various\nconfigurations are also discussed.\n", "  Certifying entanglement of a multipartite state is generally considered as a\ndemanding task. Since an $N$ qubit state is parametrized by $4^{N}-1$ real\nnumbers, one might naively expect that the measurement effort of generic\nentanglement detection also scales exponentially with $N$. Here, we introduce a\ngeneral scheme to construct efficient witnesses requiring a constant number of\nmeasurements independent of the number of qubits for states like, e.g.,\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, cluster states and Dicke states. For four\nqubits, we apply this novel method to experimental realizations of the\naforementioned states and prove genuine four-partite entanglement with two\nmeasurement settings only.\n", "  We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamical properties of a\nweakly-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature under the multi-pulsed quantum\nquench in interaction by calculating one-body, two-body correlation functions\nand Tan's contact of the model system. The multi-pulsed quench is represented\nas follows: first suddenly quenching the interatomic interaction from $g_{i}$\nto $g_{f}$ at time $t=0$, holding time $t$, and then suddenly quenching\ninteraction from $g_{f}$ back to $g_{i}$, holding the time $t$ sequence $n$\ntimes. In particular, two typical kinds of quenching parameters are chosen,\ncorresponding to $(g_{i}/g_{f}>1)$ and $(g_{i}/g_{f}<1)$ respectively. We find\nthat the more the quenching times of $n$ are, the more the excitations are\nexcited, which suggests that the multi-pulsed QQ is more powerful way of\nstudying the non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body quantum system than the\n`one-off' quantum quench. Finally, we discuss the ultra-short-range properties\nof the two-body correlation function after the $n$th quenching, which can be\nused to probe the `Tan'scontact' in experiments. All our calculations can be\ntested in current cold atom experiments.\n", "  The Debye charging method is generalized to study the linear response\nproperties of the asymmetric primitive model for electrolytes. Analytic results\nare obtained for the effective charge distributions of constituent ions inside\nthe electrolyte, from which all static linear response properties of system\nfollow. It is found that, as the ion density increases, both the screening\nlength and the dielectric constant receive substantial renormalization due to\nionic correlations. Furthermore, the valence of larger ion is substantially\nrenormalized upwards by ionic correlations, whilst that of smaller ions remains\napproximately the same. For sufficiently high density, the system exhibit\ncharge oscillations. The threshold ion density for charge oscillation is much\nlower than the corresponding value for symmetric electrolytes. Our results\nagree well with large scale Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Despite extensive work on the interplay between traffic dynamics and epidemic\nspreading, the control of epidemic spreading by routing strategies has not\nreceived adequate attention. In this paper, we study the impact of efficient\nrouting protocol on epidemic spreading. In the case of infinite node-delivery\ncapacity, where the traffic is free of congestion, we find that that there\nexists optimal values of routing parameter, leading to the maximal epidemic\nthreshold. This means that epidemic spreading can be effectively controlled by\nfine tuning the routing scheme. Moreover, we find that an increase in the\naverage network connectivity and the emergence of traffic congestion can\nsuppress the epidemic outbreak.\n", "  Scattering amplitudes of any four-dimensional theory with nonabelian gauge\ngroup $\\mathcal G$ may be recast as two-dimensional correlation functions on\nthe asymptotic two-sphere at null infinity. The soft gluon theorem is shown,\nfor massless theories at the semiclassical level, to be the Ward identity of a\nholomorphic two-dimensional $\\mathcal G$-Kac-Moody symmetry acting on these\ncorrelation functions. Holomorphic Kac-Moody current insertions are positive\nhelicity soft gluon insertions. The Kac-Moody transformations are a $CPT$\ninvariant subgroup of gauge transformations which act nontrivially at null\ninfinity and comprise the four-dimensional asymptotic symmetry group.\n", "  We test the 3d-3d correspondence for theories that are labelled by Lens\nspaces. We find a full agreement between the index of the 3d ${\\cal N}=2$ \"Lens\nspace theory\" $T[L(p,1)]$ and the partition function of complex Chern-Simons\ntheory on $L(p,1)$. In particular, for $p=1$, we show how the familiar $S^3$\npartition function of Chern-Simons theory arises from the index of a free\ntheory. For large $p$, we find that the index of $T[L(p,1)]$ becomes a constant\nindependent of $p$. In addition, we study $T[L(p,1)]$ on the squashed\nthree-sphere $S^3_b$. This enables us to see clearly, at the level of partition\nfunction, to what extent $G_\\mathbb{C}$ complex Chern-Simons theory can be\nthought of as two copies of Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$.\n", "  In order to investigate the relationship between the so-called stripe\ncorrelations and the high-Tc superconductivity, we have carried out magnetic\nsusceptibility and zero-field muon-spin-relaxation measurements in partially\nFe-substituted La2-xSrxCu1-yFeyO4 (LSCFO). It has been found that the Fe\nsubstitution induces successive magnetic transitions in the overdoped regime,\nnamely, a spin-glass transition of Fe3+ spins due to the RKKY interaction based\non itinerant spins at higher temperatures and a stripe-order transition of\nlocalized Cu2+ spins at lower temperatures. The stripe-order transition\ndisappears at the hole concentration of ~0.28 per Cu which coincides with the\nendpoint of the superconductivity in pristine La2-xSrxCuO4, suggesting that the\nstripe correlations are closely related to the high-Tc superconductivity in the\noverdoped regime as well as in the underdoped regime. As for the spin-glass\nstate, it has been found that the contribution of polarized itinerant spins to\nthe muon-spin depolarization is not negligible. Taking into account\nneutron-scattering results by R.-H. He et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 127002\n(2011)] that a spin-density-wave (SDW) order has been observed in overdoped\nLSCFO, the present results demonstrate the presence of a novel coexistent state\nof a SDW order and a spin-glass state.\n", "  We propose a projection measurement onto encoded Bell states with a static\nnetwork of linear optical elements. By increasing the size of the quantum error\ncorrection code, both Bell measurement efficiency and photon-loss tolerance can\nbe made arbitrarily high at the same time. As a main application, we show that\nall-optical quantum communication over large distances with communication rates\nsimilar to those of classical communication is possible solely based on local\nstate teleportations using optical sources of encoded Bell states, fixed arrays\nof beam splitters, and photon detectors. As another application, generalizing\nstate teleportation to gate teleportation for quantum computation, we find that\nin order to achieve universality the intrinsic loss tolerance must be\nsacrificed and a minimal amount of feedforward has to be added.\n", "  DIOS (Diffuse Intergalactic Oxygen Surveyor) is a small satellite aiming for\na launch around 2020 with JAXA's Epsilon rocket. Its main aim is a search for\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium with high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of\nredshifted emission lines from OVII and OVIII ions. The superior energy\nresolution of TES microcalorimeters combined with a very wide field of view\n(30--50 arcmin diameter) will enable us to look into gas dynamics of cosmic\nplasmas in a wide range of spatial scales from Earth's magnetosphere to\nunvirialized regions of clusters of galaxies. Mechanical and thermal design of\nthe spacecraft and development of the TES calorimeter system are described. We\nalso consider revising the payload design to optimize the scientific capability\nallowed by the boundary conditions of the small mission.\n", "  A classic result in the foundations of Yang-Mills theory, due to J. W.\nBarrett [\"Holonomy and Path Structures in General Relativity and Yang-Mills\nTheory.\" Int. J. Th. Phys. 30(9), (1991)], establishes that given a\n\"generalized\" holonomy map from the space of piece-wise smooth, closed curves\nbased at some point of a manifold to a Lie group, there exists a principal\nbundle with that group as structure group and a principal connection on that\nbundle such that the holonomy map corresponds to the holonomies of that\nconnection. Barrett also provided one sense in which this \"recovery theorem\"\nyields a unique bundle, up to isomorphism. Here we show that something stronger\nis true: with an appropriate definition of isomorphism between generalized\nholonomy maps, there is an equivalence of categories between the category whose\nobjects are generalized holonomy maps on a smooth, connected manifold and whose\narrows are holonomy isomorphisms, and the category whose objects are principal\nconnections on principal bundles over a smooth, connected manifold. This result\nclarifies, and somewhat improves upon, the sense of \"unique recovery\" in\nBarrett's theorems; it also makes precise a sense in which there is no loss of\nstructure involved in moving from a principal bundle formulation of Yang-Mills\ntheory to a holonomy, or \"loop\", formulation.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to exhibit a deep relation between the partition\nfunction of the Ising model on a planar trivalent graph and the generating\nseries of the spin network evaluations on the same graph. We provide\nrespectively a fermionic and a bosonic Gaussian integral formulation for each\nof these functions and we show that they are the inverse of each other (up to\nsome explicit constants) by exhibiting a supersymmetry relating the two\nformulations. We investigate three aspects and applications of this duality.\nFirst, we propose higher order supersymmetric theories which couple the\ngeometry of the spin networks to the Ising model and for which supersymmetric\nlocalization still holds. Secondly, after interpreting the generating function\nof spin network evaluations as the projection of a coherent state of loop\nquantum gravity onto the flat connection state, we find the probability\ndistribution induced by that coherent state on the edge spins and study its\nstationary phase approximation. It is found that the stationary points\ncorrespond to the critical values of the couplings of the 2D Ising model, at\nleast for isoradial graphs. Third, we analyze the mapping of the correlations\nof the Ising model to spin network observables, and describe the phase\ntransition on those observables on the hexagonal lattice. This opens the door\nto many new possibilities, especially for the study of the coarse-graining and\ncontinuum limit of spin networks in the context of quantum gravity.\n", "  We present a derivation of the Markovian master equation by the\nrenormalization group method. Starting from a naive perturbative solution of\nthe von Neumann equation, the reduced density matrix with the coarse grained\ntime steps is obtained using the assumption of short correlation time of the\nbath field. Then by applying the renormalization group method, we show that the\ndependence of the specific initial time on the perturbative solution can be\nremoved and the Markovian semigroup master equation in the\nGorini--Kossakowski--Lindblad--Sudarshan (GKLS) form is obtained in the weak\ncoupling limit.\n", "  In recent years we have witnessed a concentrated effort to make sense of\nthermodynamics for small-scale systems. One of the main difficulties is to\ncapture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of\nquantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic\nmachines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform. In this work, we adopt a novel strategy by\nconsidering arbitrary kinds of systems that one can attach to a quantum thermal\nmachine and seeking for work quantifiers. These are functions that measure the\nvalue of a transition and generalise the concept of work beyond the model of a\nlifted weight. We do so by imposing simple operational axioms that any\nreasonable work quantifier must fulfil and by deriving from them stringent\nmathematical condition with a clear physical interpretation. Our approach\nallows us to derive much of the structure of the theory of thermodynamics\nwithout taking as a primitive the definition of work. We can derive, for any\nwork quantifier, a quantitative second law in the sense of bounding the work\nthat can be performed using some non-equilibrium resource by the work that is\nneeded to create it. We also discuss in detail the role of reversibility and\ncorrelations in connection with the second law. Furthermore, we recover the\nusual identification of work with energy in degrees of freedom with vanishing\nentropy as a particular case of our formalism. Our mathematical results can be\nformulated abstractly and are general enough to carry over to other resource\ntheories than quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  We experimentally examine a laser-induced underwater shock wave with a\nspecial attention to pressure impulse, the time integral of pressure evolution.\n%total pressure variation associated with the shock wave. Plasma formation,\nshock-wave expansion, and pressure in water are observed simultaneously using a\ncombined measurement system that obtains high-resolution nanosecond-order image\nsequences. These detailed measurements reveal a non-spherically-symmetric\ndistribution of pressure peak. In contrast, remarkably, pressure impulse is\nfound to distribute symmetrically for a wide range of experimental parameters\neven when the shock waves are emitted from an elongated region. The structure\nis determined to be a collection of multiple spherical shock waves originated\nfrom point-like plasmas in the elongated region.\n", "  Geometrical coupling in a co-dimensional one Randall-Sundrum scenario (RS) is\nused to study resonances of $p-$form fields. The resonances are calculated\nusing the transfer matrix method. The model studied consider the standard RS\nwith delta-like branes, and branes generated by kinks and domain-wall as well.\nThe parameters are changed to control the thickness of the smooth brane. With\nthis a very interesting pattern is found for the resonances. The geometrical\ncoupling does not generate resonances for the reduced $p-$form in all cases\nconsidered.\n", "  The brief description of installation TAU-2 intended for long-term monitoring\nof the half-life value $\\tau$ ($\\tau_{1/2}$) of the $^{214}$Po is presented.\nThe methods of measurement and processing of collected data are reported. The\nresults of analysis of time series values $\\tau$ with different time step are\npresented. Total of measurement time was equal to 590 days. Averaged value of\nthe $^{214}$Po half-life was obtained $\\tau=163.46\\pm0.04$ $\\mu$s. The annual\nvariation with an amplitude $A=(8.9\\pm2.3)\\cdot10^{-4}$, solar-daily variation\nwith an amplitude $A_{So}=(7.5\\pm1.2)\\cdot10^{-4}$, lunar-daily variation with\nan amplitude $A_L=(6.9\\pm2.0)\\cdot10^{-4}$ and sidereal-daily variation with an\namplitude $A_S=(7.2\\pm1.2)\\cdot10^{-4}$ were found in a series of $\\tau$\nvalues. The maximal values of amplitude are observed at the moments when the\nprojections of the installation Earth location velocity vectors toward the\nsource of possible variation achieve its maximal magnitudes.\n", "  We examine the capability of a blast-wave scenario -associated to a coronal\nflare or to the expansion of CME flanks- to reproduce a chromospheric Moreton\nphenomenon. We also simulate the Moreton event of December 06, 2006 considering\nboth the corona and the chromosphere. To obtain a sufficiently strong coronal\nshock -able to generate a detectable chromospheric Moreton wave- a relatively\nlow magnetic field intensity is required, in comparison with the active region\nvalues. Employing reasonable coronal constraints, we show that a flare ignited\nblast-wave or the expansion of the CME flanks emulated as an instantaneous or a\ntemporal piston model, respectively, are capable to reproduce the observations.\n", "  We study lattice constructions of gapped fermionic phases of matter. We show\nthat the construction of fermionic Symmetry Protected Topological orders by Gu\nand Wen has a hidden dependence on a discrete spin structure on the Euclidean\nspace-time. The spin structure is needed to resolve ambiguities which are\notherwise present. An identical ambiguity is shown to arise in the fermionic\nanalog of the string-net construction of 2D topological orders. We argue that\nthe need for a spin structure is a general feature of lattice models with local\nfermionic degrees of freedom and is a lattice analog of the spin-statistics\nrelation.\n", "  We study the asymptotic distribution of the resonances near the Landau levels\n$\\Lambda\\_q =(2q+1)b$, $q \\in \\mathbb{N}$, of the Dirichlet (resp. Neumann,\nresp. Robin) realization in the exterior of a compact domain of $\\mathbb{R}^3$\nof the 3D Schr{\\\"o}dinger operator with constant magnetic field of scalar\nintensity $b\\textgreater{}0$. We investigate the corresponding resonance\ncounting function and obtain the main asymptotic term. In particular, we prove\nthe accumulation of resonances at the Landau levels and the existence of\nresonance free sectors. In some cases, it provides the discreteness of the set\nof embedded eigenvalues near the Landau levels.\n", "  This work deals with the study of embeddings of toric Calabi-Yau fourfolds\nwhich are complex cones over the smooth Fano threefolds. In particular, we\nfocus on finding various embeddings of Fano threefolds inside other Fano\nthreefolds and study the partial resolution of the latter in hope to find new\ntoric dualities. We find many diagrams possible for many of these Fano\nthreefolds, but unfortunately, none of them are consistent quiver theories. We\nalso obtain a quiver Chern-Simons theory which matches a theory known to the\nliterature, thus providing an alternate method of obtaining it.\n", "  Recently, Majorana Fermions (MFs) have attracted intensive attention due to\ntheir exotic statistics and possible applications in topological quantum\ncomputation (TQC). They are proposed to exist in various two-dimensional (2D)\ntopological systems, such as px+ipy topological superconductor and\nnanowire-superconducting hybridization system. In this paper, two types of\nMajorana Fermions with different polygon sign rules are pointed out. A \"smoking\ngun\" numerical evidence to identify MF's classification is presented through\nlooking for the signature of a first order topological quantum phase\ntransition. By using it, several 2D topological superconductors are studied.\n", "  In this work we have studied the effect of target thickness on relativistic\nself-induced transparency (RSIT) and found out that for subwavelength targets\nthe corresponding threshold target density (beyond which target is opaque to\nincident laser pulse of a given intensity) increases. The accelerating\nlongitudinal electrostatic field created by RSIT from subwavelength target is\nused to accelerate the ion bunch from a thin, low density layer behind the main\ntarget to $\\sim$ 100 MeV. A suitable scaling law for optimum laser and target\nconditions is also deduced. The word `via' in the title signifies the fact that\nwe are interested in acceleration of ions from the layer placed behind the\ntarget. It is also being observed that as per as energy spectrum is concerned;\nan extra low density layer is advantageous than relying on target ions alone.\n", "  We determine the shared information that can be extracted from time-bin\nentangled photons using frame encoding. We consider photons generated by a\ngeneral down-conversion source and also model losses, dark counts and the\neffects of multiple photons within each frame. Furthermore, we describe a\nprocedure for including other imperfections such as after-pulsing, detector\ndead-times and jitter. The results are illustrated by deriving analytic\nexpressions for the maximum information that can be extracted from\nhigh-dimensional time-bin entangled photons generated by a spontaneous\nparametric down conversion. A key finding is that under realistic conditions\nand using standard SPAD detectors one can still choose frame size so as to\nextract over 10 bits per photon. These results are thus useful for experiments\non high-dimensional quantum-key distribution system.\n", "  We report on studying the dynamic evolution of orbital angular momentum (OAM)\ncarrying light in sum frequency generation (SFG). Dynamic evolution of the SFG\nbeam is studied in different cases, in which the two pump beams are either a\nsingle OAM mode or OAM superposition mode. For the cases when the two pumps are\nboth in superposition mode, two kinds of spatial patterns and evolution\nbehaviors are observed, one set of spatial pattern is non-diffractive and\nunchanged with propagating. In addition, SFG of two pump beams with opposite\nOAM will evolve into a kind of quasi-Gaussian mode. These observations show\nthat the pumps phases are coherently transferred to SFG beam in the conversion\nprocess. Our findings give insights to physical picture of OAM light\ntransformation in nonlinear processes, which can be used in OAM mode\nengineering and de-multiplexing of different OAM modes.\n", "  The monoclinic crystal structure of $\\beta$-$\\mathrm{Ga_2O_3}$ leads to\nsignificant anisotropy of the thermal properties. The 2$\\omega$-method is used\nto measure the thermal diffusivity $D$ in [010] and [001] direction\nrespectively and to determine the thermal conductivity values $\\lambda$ of the\n[100], [010] and [001] direction from the same insulating Mg doped\n$\\beta$-$\\mathrm{Ga_2O_3}$ single crystal. We detect a temperature independent\nanisotropy factor of both the thermal diffusivity and conductivity values of\n$D_{[010]}/D_{[001]}=\\lambda_{[010]}/\\lambda_{[001]}=1.4\\pm 0.1$. The\ntemperature-dependence is in accord with phonon-phonon-Umklapp scattering\nprocesses from 300 K down to 150 K. Below 150 K point-defect-scattering lowers\nthe estimated phonon-phonon-Umklapp-scattering values.\n", "  Recently, several kinds of integrable deformations of the string world sheet\ntheory in the gauge/gravity correspondence have been constructed. One class of\nthese, the k deformations associated to the more general q deformations but\nwith q=exp(i pi/k) a root of unity, has been shown to be related to a\nparticular discrete deformation of the principal chiral models and\n(semi-)symmetric space sigma models involving a gauged WZW model. We conjecture\na form for the exact S-matrices of the bosonic integrable field theories of\nthis type. The S-matrices imply that the theories have a hidden infinite\ndimensional affine quantum group symmetry. We provide some evidence, via\nquantum inverse scattering techniques, that the theories do indeed possess the\nfinite-dimensional part of this quantum group symmetry.\n", "  We consider the electromagnetic production of positron and electron in\ncollisions of slow heavy nuclei. This process is dominated by emission of\npositron, with the electron captured by nucleus.\n", "  In the small noise regime, the average transition time between metastable\nstates of a reversible diffusion process is described at the logarithmic scale\nby Arrhenius' law. The Eyring-Kramers formula classically provides a\nsubexponential prefactor to this large deviation estimate. For irreversible\ndiffusion processes, the equivalent of Arrhenius' law is given by the\nFreidlin-Wentzell theory. In this paper, we compute the associated prefactor\nand thereby generalise the Eyring-Kramers formula to irreversible diffusion\nprocesses. In our formula, the role of the potential is played by\nFreidlin-Wentzell's quasipotential, and a correction depending on the\nnon-Gibbsianness of the system along the instanton is highlighted. Our analysis\nrelies on a WKB analysis of the quasistationary distribution of the process in\nmetastable regions, and on a probabilistic study of the process in the\nneighbourhood of saddle-points of the quasipotential.\n", "  Neutrino produced in a chain of nuclear reactions in the Sun starting from\nthe fusion of two protons, for the first time has been detected in a real-time\ndetector in spectrometric mode. The unique properties of the Borexino detector\nprovided an oppurtunity to disentangle pp-neutrino spectrum from the background\ncomponents. A comparison of the total neutrino flux from the Sun with Solar\nluminosity in photons provides a test of the stability of the Sun on the\n10$^{5}$ years time scale, and sets a strong limit on the power production in\nthe unknown energy sources in the Sun of no more than 4\\% of the total energy\nproduction at 90\\% C.L.\n", "  We show that there is a natural universal limit of the topological string\nfree energies at the large radius point. The new free energies keep a\nnonholomorphic dependence on the complex structure moduli space and their\nfunctional form is the same for all Calabi-Yau geometries, compact and\nnoncompact alike. The asymptotic nature of the free energy expansion changes in\nthis limit due to a milder factorial growth of its coefficients, and this\nimplies a transseries extension with instanton effects in $\\exp(- 1/g_s^2)$, of\nNS-brane type, rather than $\\exp(-1/g_s)$, of D-brane type. We show a relation\nbetween the instanton action of NS-brane type and the volume of the Calabi-Yau\nmanifold which points to a possible interpretation in terms of NS5-branes. A\nsimilar rescaling limit has been considered recently leading to an Airy\nequation for the partition function which is here used to explain the resurgent\nproperties of the rescaled transseries.\n", "  We show how to use standard transmission line outage historical data to\nobtain the network topology in such a way that cascades of line outages can be\neasily located on the network. Then we obtain statistics quantifying how\ncascading outages typically spread on the network. Processing real outage data\nis fundamental for understanding cascading and for evaluating the validity of\nthe many different models and simulations that have been proposed for cascading\nin power networks.\n", "  Given a family of self-adjoint operators $(A_t)_{t\\in T}$ indexed by a\nparameter $t$ in some topological space $T$, necessary and sufficient\nconditions are given for the spectrum $\\sigma(A_t)$ to be Vietoris continuous\nwith respect to $t$. Equivalently the boundaries and the gap edges are\ncontinuous in $t$. If $(T,d)$ is a complete metric space with metric $d$, these\nconditions are extended to guarantee H\\\"older continuity of the spectral\nboundaries and of the spectral gap edges. As a corollary, an upper bound is\nprovided for the size of closing gaps.\n", "  Folksonomies - large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by\nindependent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing\ninformation. In these systems users can tag items with free words, resulting in\na tripartite item-tag-user network. Although there are no prescribed relations\nbetween tags, the way users think about the different categories presumably has\nsome built in hierarchy, in which more special concepts are descendants of some\nmore general categories. Several applications would benefit from the knowledge\nof this hierarchy. Here we apply a recent method to check the differences and\nsimilarities of hierarchies resulting from tags given by independent\nindividuals and from tags given by a centrally managed repository system. The\nresults from out method showed substantial differences between the lower part\nof the hierarchies, and in contrast, a relatively high similarity at the top of\nthe hierarchies.\n", "  We demonstrate an on-chip device utilizing the concept of artificial cavity\nmagnon-polariton (CMP) coupling between the microwave cavity mode and the\ndynamics of the artificial magnetism in a split ring resonator. This on-chip\ndevice allows the easy tuning of the artificial CMP gap by using a DC voltage\nsignal, which enables tuneable electrodynamically induced transparency. The\nhigh tunability of the artificial magnon-polariton system not only enables the\nstudy of the characteristic phenomena associated with distinct coupling\nregimes, but also may open up avenues for designing novel microwave devices and\nultra-sensitive sensors.\n", "  Reggeon unitarity and non-abelian gauge field copies are focussed on as two\nGribov discoveries that, it is suggested, may ultimately be seen as the most\nsignificant and that could, in the far distant future, form the cornerstones of\nhis legacy. The crucial role played by the Gribov ambiguity in the construction\nof gauge theory bound-state amplitudes via reggeon unitarity is described. It\nis suggested that the existence of a physical, unitary, S-Matrix in a gauge\ntheory is a major requirement that could even determine the theory.\n", "  In a Fermi superfluid increasing population imbalance leads initially to\nreduction of the transition temperature, then the appearance of modulated\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states, and finally the suppression of\npairing itself. For interaction strength such that the `balanced' system has a\nnormal state pseudogap, increasing imbalance reveals anomalous spectral\nbehavior. At a fixed weak imbalance (small polarization) the stable homogeneous\nsuperfluid occurs only above a certain temperature. The density of states has a\nminimum at the Fermi level, then a weak peak {\\it within the gap}, and then the\nlarge, gap edge, coherence features. On heating, this non monotonic energy\ndependence changes to a more conventional fluctuation driven pseudogap, with a\nmonotonic energy dependence. At large imbalance the ground state is FFLO and\n`pseudogapped' due to the modulated order. It changes to a gapless normal state\non heating, and then shows a pseudogap again at a higher temperature. These\nweak imbalance and strong imbalance features both involve effects well beyond\nmean field theory. We establish them by using a Monte Carlo technique on large\nlattices, motivate the results in terms of the pairing field distribution, and\ncompare them to spectroscopic results in the imbalanced unitary Fermi gas.\n", "  Condensation of a liquid droplet from a supersaturated vapour phase is\ninitiated by a prototypical nucleation event. As such it is challenging to\ncompute its rate from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. In fact at\nrealistic supersaturation conditions condensation occurs on time scales that\nfar exceed what can be reached with conventional molecular dynamics methods.\nAnother known problem in this context is the distortion of the free energy\nprofile associated to nucleation due to the small, finite size of typical\nsimulation boxes. In this work the problem of time scale is addressed with a\nrecently developed enhanced sampling method while contextually correcting for\nfinite size effects. We demonstrate our approach by studying the condensation\nof argon, and showing that characteristic nucleation times of the order of\nmagnitude of hours can be reliably calculated, approaching realistic\nsupersaturation conditions, thus bridging the gap between what standard\nmolecular dynamics simulations can do and real physical systems.\n", "  Biopolymer Networks play an important role in coordinating and regulating\ncollective cellular dynamics via a number of signaling pathways. Here, we\ninvestigate the mechanical response of a model biopolymer network due to the\nactive contraction of embedded cells. Specifically, a graph (bond-node) model\nderived from confocal microscopy data is used to represent the network\nmicrostructure, and cell contraction is modeled by applying correlated\ndisplacements at specific nodes, representing the focal adhesion sites. A\nforce-based stochastic relaxation method is employed to obtain force-balanced\nnetwork under cell contraction. We find that the majority of the forces are\ncarried by a small number of heterogeneous force chains emitted from the\ncontracting cells. The force chains consist of fiber segments that either\npossess a high degree of alignment before cell contraction or are aligned due\nto the reorientation induced by cell contraction. Large fluctuations of the\nforces along different force chains are observed. Importantly, the decay of the\nforces along the force chains is significantly slower than the decay of\nradially averaged forces in the system. These results suggest that the fibrous\nnature of biopolymer network structure can support long-range force\ntransmission and thus, long-range mechanical signaling between cells.\n", "  Diffusion of self-propelled particles in the presence of randomly distributed\nobstacles in three dimensions is studied using molecular dynamics simulations.\nIt is found that depending on the magnitude of the propelling force and the\nparticle aspect ratio, the diffusion coefficient can be a monotonically\ndecreasing or a non-monotonic concave function of the obstructed volume\nfraction. Counterintuitive enhancement of the particle diffusivity with\nincreasing the obstacles crowd is shown to be a combinatory effect of the\nself-propelling force and the anisotropy in the shape of the particle. Regions\ncorresponding to monotonic and non-monotonic dependence of the particle\ndiffusivity on the obstacle density in propelling force-aspect ratio plane are\nspecified theoretically and using the simulation results.\n", "  We investigate eigenfunctions of the Laplacian perturbed by a delta potential\non the standard tori $\\mathbb{R}^d/2 \\pi\\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimensions $d=2,3$.\nDespite quantum ergodicity holding for the set of \"new\" eigenfunctions we show\nthat there is scarring in the momentum representation for $d=2,3$, as well as\nin the position representation for $d=2$ (i.e., the eigenfunctions fail to\nequidistribute in phase space along an infinite subsequence of new\neigenvalues.) For $d=3$, scarred eigenstates are quite rare, but for $d=2$\nscarring in the momentum representation is very common --- with $N_{2}(x) \\sim\nx/\\sqrt{\\log x}$ denoting the counting function for the new eigenvalues below\n$x$, there are $\\gg N_{2}(x)/\\log^A x$ eigenvalues corresponding to momentum\nscarred eigenfunctions.\n", "  Discussion of physical realization of coordinates demonstrates that the\nquantum theory of gravity (still absent) should be non-local and, probably,\nnon-commutative as well.\n", "  Instantons on various spaces can be constructed via a generalization of the\nFourier transform called the ADHM-Nahm transform. An explicit use of this\nconstruction, however, involves rather tedious calculations. Here we derive a\nsimple formula for instantons on a space with one periodic direction. It\nsimplifies the ADHM-Nahm machinery and can be generalized to other spaces.\n", "  We study the mutual regularity properties of Palm measures of point\nprocesses, and establish that a key determining factor for these properties is\nthe rigidity-tolerance behaviour of the point process in question (for those\nprocesses that exhibit such behaviour). Thereby, we extend the results of\nOsada-Shirai, Bufetov and Olshanski to new ensembles, particularly those that\nare devoid of any determinantal structure. These include the zeroes of the\nstandard planar Gaussian analytic function and several others.\n", "  The truncation or compression of the spectrum of Schmidt values is inherent\nto the matrix product state (MPS) approximation of one-dimensional quantum\nground states. We provide a renormalization group picture by interpreting this\ncompression as an application of Wilson's numerical renormalization group along\nthe imaginary time direction appearing in the path integral representation of\nthe state. The location of the physical index is considered as an impurity in\nthe transfer matrix and static MPS correlation functions are reinterpreted as\ndynamical impurity correlations. Coarse-graining the transfer matrix is\nperformed using a hybrid variational ansatz based on matrix product operators,\ncombining ideas of MPS and the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz.\nThrough numerical comparison with conventional MPS algorithms, we explicitly\nverify the impurity interpretation of MPS compression, as put forward by [V.\nZauner et al., New J. Phys. 17, 053002 (2015)] for the transverse-field Ising\nmodel. Additionally, we motivate the conceptual usefulness of endowing MPS with\nan internal layered structure by studying restricted variational subspaces to\ndescribe elementary excitations on top of the ground state, which serves to\nelucidate a transparent renormalization group structure ingrained in MPS\ndescriptions of ground states.\n", "  We survey the matrix product solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation obtained\nrecently from the tetrahedron equation. They form a family of quantum $R$\nmatrices of generalized quantum groups interpolating the symmetric tensor\nrepresentations of $U_q(A^{(1)}_{n-1})$ and the anti-symmetric tensor\nrepresentations of $U_{-q^{-1}}(A^{(1)}_{n-1})$. We show that at $q=0$ they all\nreduce to the Yang-Baxter maps called combinatorial $R$, and describe the\nlatter by explicit algorithm.\n", "  We apply density functional theory, in the local density approximation, to a\nquasi-one-dimensional electron gas in order to quantify the effect of Coulomb\nand correlation effects in modulating, and therefore patterning, the charge\ndensity distribution. Our calculations are presented specifically for\nsurface-gate-defined quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires in a GaAs-AlGaAs\nheterostructure but we expect our results to apply more generally for other low\ndimensional semiconductor systems. We show that at high densities with strong\nconfinement, screening of electrons in the direction transverse to the wire is\nefficient and density modulations are not visible. In the low-density,\nweak-confinement regime, the exchange-correlation potential induces small\ndensity modulations as the electrons are depleted from the wire. At the weakest\nconfinements and lowest densities, the electron density splits into two rows\nthereby forming a pair of quantum wires that lie beneath the surface gates. An\nadditional double-well external potential forms at very low density which\nenhances this row splitting phenomenon. We produce phase diagrams that show a\ntransition between the presence of a single quantum wire in a split-gate\nstructure and two quantum wires. We suggest that this phenomenon can be used to\npattern and modulate the electron density in low-dimensional structures with\nparticular application to systems where a proximity effect from a surface gate\nwould be valuable.\n", "  Interactions induced by electromagnetic fluctuations, such as van der Waals\nand Casimir forces, are of universal nature present at any length scale between\nany types of systems with finite dimensions. Such interactions are important\nnot only for the fundamental science of materials behavior, but also for the\ndesign and improvement of micro- and nano-structured devices. In the past\ndecade, many new materials have become available, which has stimulated the need\nof understanding their dispersive interactions. The field of van der Waals and\nCasimir forces has experienced an impetus in terms of developing novel\ntheoretical and computational methods to provide new insights in related\nphenomena. The understanding of such forces has far reaching consequences as it\nbridges concepts in materials, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter\nphysics, high energy physics, chemistry and biology. In this review, we\nsummarize major breakthroughs and emphasize the common origin of van der Waals\nand Casimir interactions. We examine progress related to novel ab initio\nmodeling approaches and their application in various systems, interactions in\nmaterials with Dirac-like spectra, force manipulations through nontrivial\nboundary conditions, and applications of van der Waals forces in organic and\nbiological matter. The outlook of the review is to give the scientific\ncommunity a materials perspective of van der Waals and Casimir phenomena and\nstimulate the development of experimental techniques and applications.\n", "  We explore the possibility to explain the properties of the Be/X-ray pulsars\nobserved in the Small Magellanic Cloud within the magnetic levitation accretion\nscenario. This implies that their X-ray emission is powered by a wind-fed\naccretion onto a neutron star (NS) which captures matter from a magnetized\nstellar wind. The NS in this case is accreting matter from a non-keplerian\nmagnetically levitating disc (ML-disc) which is surrounding its magnetosphere.\nThis allows us to explain the observed periods of the pulsars in terms of spin\nequilibrium without the need of invoking dipole magnetic fields outside the\nusual range ~ 10^11- 10^13 G inferred from cyclotron features of Galactic high\nmass X-ray binaries. We find that the equilibrium period of a NS, under certain\nconditions, depends strongly on the magnetization of the stellar wind of its\nmassive companion and, correspondingly, on the magnetic field of the massive\ncompanion itself. This may help to explain why similar NSs in binaries with\nsimilar properties rotate with different periods yielding a large scatter of\nperiods of the accretion-powered pulsar observed in SMC and our galaxy.\n", "  We consider a Haag-Kastler net in a positive energy representation, admitting\nmassive Wigner particles and asymptotic fields of massless bosons. We show that\nstates of the massive particles are always vacua of the massless asymptotic\nfields. Our argument is based on the Mean Ergodic Theorem in a certain extended\nHilbert space. As an application of this result we construct the outgoing\nisometric wave operator for Compton scattering in QED in a class of\nrepresentations recently proposed by Buchholz and Roberts. In the course of\nthis analysis we use our new technique to further simplify scattering theory of\nmassless bosons in the vacuum sector. A general discussion of the status of the\ninfrared problem in the setting of Buchholz and Roberts is given.\n", "  The predictions for transition form factors $\\gamma^*\\to \\gamma f_2(1270)$\nand $\\gamma^*\\to \\gamma a_2(1320)$ and corresponding $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to\nf_2\\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to a_2\\gamma$ cross sections are obtained\nfor the energy region up to $2$ GeV. These predictions are coordinated with the\nrecent Belle data on the $\\gamma^*(Q^2)\\gamma\\to f_2$ transition. It is shown\nthat the QCD asymptotics of the amplitudes of the reactions $e^+e^-\\to\n\\gamma^*\\to f_2\\gamma$ and $e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to a_2\\gamma$ can be reached\nonly by taking into account a compensation of contributions of $\\rho(770)$,\n$\\omega(782)$ with contributions of their radial excitations. The relation\n$\\sigma(e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to f_2\\gamma)/\\sigma(e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to\na_2\\gamma)\\approx 25/9$, obtained with the help of the $q\\bar q$ model of $a_2$\nand $f_2$ and QCD, is used to determine the $\\sigma(e^+e^-\\to \\gamma^*\\to\na_2\\gamma)$ at high energies. Recent BABAR measurement of the $e^+e^-\\to\nf_2\\gamma\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\gamma$ cross section at $10.58$ GeV gives hope for\ndetailed investigation of the $\\gamma^*(s)\\to f_2\\gamma$ and $\\gamma^*(s)\\to\na_2\\gamma$ transition form factors at high energy region.\n", "  Inhibitory circuits of relaxation oscillators are often-used models for the\ndynamics of biological networks. We present a qualitative and quantitative\nstability analysis of such a circuit constituted by three reciprocally coupled\noscillators of a Fitzhugh-Nagumo type as nodes. Depending on inhibitory\nstrengths, and parameters of individual oscillators, the circuit exhibits\npolyrhythmicity of up to five simultaneously stable rhythms. With methods of\nbifurcation analysis and phase reduction, we investigate qualitative changes in\nstability of these circuit rhythms for a wide range of parameters. Furthermore,\nwe quantify how robustly rhythms are maintained under random perturbations by\nmonitoring phase diffusion in the circuit. Our findings allow us to describe\nhow circuit dynamics relate to dynamics of individual nodes. We also find that\nquantitative and qualitative stability of polyrhythmicity do not always align.\n", "  For any cosmological constant $\\Lambda=-3/\\ell^2<0$ and any $\\alpha<9/4$, we\nfind a Kerr-AdS spacetime $(\\mathcal M,g_{\\mathrm{KAdS}})$, in which the\nKlein-Gordon equation $\\Box_{g_{\\mathrm{KAdS}}}\\psi+\\alpha/\\ell^2\\psi=0$ has an\nexponentially growing mode solution satisfying a Dirichlet boundary condition\nat infinity. The spacetime violates the Hawking-Reall bound $r_+^2>|a|\\ell$. We\nobtain an analogous result for Neumann boundary conditions if $5/4<\\alpha<9/4$.\nMoreover, in the Dirichlet case, one can prove that, for any Kerr-AdS spacetime\nviolating the Hawking-Reall bound, there exists an open family of masses\n$\\alpha$ such that the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation permits\nexponentially growing mode solutions. Our result adopts methods of\nShlapentokh-Rothman (see arXiv:1302.3448) and provides the first rigorous\nconstruction of a superradiant instability for negative cosmological constant.\n", "  We explore the performance of a statistical learning technique based on\nGaussian Process (GP) regression as an efficient non-parametric method for\nconstructing multi-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic\nmolecules. Using an example of the molecule N$_4$, we show that a realistic GP\nmodel of the six-dimensional PES can be constructed with only 240 potential\nenergy points. We construct a series of the GP models and illustrate the\nconvergence of the accuracy of the resulting surfaces as a function of the\nnumber of ${\\it ab \\ initio}$ points. We show that the GP model based on $\\sim\n1500$ potential energy points achieves the same level of accuracy as the\nconventional regression fits based on 16,421 points. The GP model of the PES\nrequires no fitting of ${\\it ab \\ initio}$ data with analytical functions and\ncan be readily extended to surfaces of higher dimensions.\n", "  The gauge coupling unification can be achieved at a unification scale around\n5 x 10^{13} GeV if the Standard Model scalar sector is extended with extra\nHiggs-like doublets. The relevant new scalar degrees of freedom in the form of\nchiral Z* and W* vector bosons might \"be visible\" already at about 700 GeV.\nTheir eventual preferred coupling to the heavy quarks explains the non\nobservation of these bosons in the first LHC run and provides promising\nexpectation for the second LHC run.\n", "  Metallic diffusion-limited aggregate (DLA) films are well-known to exhibit\nnear-perfect broadband optical absorption. We demonstrate that such films also\nmanifest a substantial and relatively material-independent photoacoustic\nresponse, as a consequence of their random nanostructure. We theoretically and\nexperimentally analyze photoacoustic phenomena in DLA films, and show that they\ncan be used to create broadband air- coupled acoustic sources. These sources\nare inexpensive and simple to fabricate, and work into the ultrasonic regime.\nWe illustrate the device possibilities by building and testing an\noptically-addressed acoustic phased array capable of producing virtually\narbitrary acoustic intensity patterns in air.\n", "  Lecture Notes of the Summer School ``Microswimmers -- From Single Particle\nMotion to Collective Behaviour'', organised by the DFG Priority Programme SPP\n1726 (Forschungszentrum J{\\\"{u}}lich, 2015).\n", "  Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) provide information on the\ndistribution of quarks in impact paarmeter space. For transversely polarized\nnucleons, these impact parameter distributions are transversely distorted and\nthis deviation from axial symmetry leads on average to a net transverse force\nfrom the spectators on the active quark in a DIS experiment. %The strength of\nthat force can be related to twist-3 PDFs. This force when acting along the\nwhole trajectory of the active quark leads to a transverse single-spin\nasymmetries. For a longitudinally polarized nucleon target, the transverse\nforce implies a torque acting on the quark Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). The\nresulting change in OAM as the quark leaves the target equals the difference\nbetween the Jaffe-Manohar and Ji OAMs.\n", "  The variational Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge is reviewed and\nthe essential results obtained in recent years are summarized. First the\nresults for the vacuum sector are discussed, with a special emphasis on the\nmechansim of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. Then the deconfinement\nphase transition is described by introducing temperature in the Hamiltonian\napproach via compactification of one spatial dimension. The effective action\nfor the Polyakov loop is calculated and the order of the phase transition as\nwell as the critical temperatures are obtained for the color group SU(2) and\nSU(3). In both cases, our predictions are in good agreement with lattice\ncalculations.\n", "  Thin-film based phase plates are meanwhile a widespread tool to enhance the\ncontrast of weak-phase objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The\nthin film usually consists of amorphous carbon, which suffers from quick\ndegeneration under the intense electron-beam illumination. Recent\ninvestigations have focused on the search for alternative materials with an\nimproved material stability. This work presents thin-film based phase plates\nfabricated from metallic glass alloys, which are characterized by a high\nelectrical conductivity and an amorphous structure. Thin films of the\nzirconium-based alloy Zr65.0Al7.5Cu27.5 (ZAC) are prepared and their\nphase-shifting properties are tested. The ZAC-alloy film is investigated by\ndifferent TEM techniques, which reveal a range of beneficial characteristics.\nParticularly favorable is the small probability for inelastic plasmon\nscattering, which is promising to improve the performance of thin-film based\nphase plates in phase-contrast TEM.\n", "  In this paper we study supersymmetric co-dimension 2 and 4 defects in the\ncompactification of the 6d $(2,0)$ theory of type $A_{N-1}$ on a 3-manifold\n$M$. The so-called 3d-3d correspondence is a relation between complexified\nChern-Simons theory (with gauge group $SL(N, \\mathbb{C})$) on $M$ and a 3d\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T_{N}[M]$. We establish a dictionary for this\ncorrespondence in the presence of supersymmetric defects, which are knots/links\ninside the 3-manifold. Our study employs a number of different methods:\nstate-integral models for complex Chern-Simons theory, cluster algebra\ntechniques, domain wall theory $T[SU(N)]$, 5d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM, and also\nsupergravity analysis through holography. These methods are complementary and\nwe find agreement between them. In some cases the results lead to highly\nnon-trivial predictions on the partition function. Our discussion includes a\ngeneral expression for the cluster partition function, in particular for\nnon-maximal punctures and $N>2$. We also highlight the non-Abelian description\nof the 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $T_N[M]$ theory with defect included, as well as its\nHiggsing prescription and the resulting `refinement' in complex CS theory. This\npaper is a companion to our shorter paper arXiv:1510.03884, which summarizes\nour main results.\n", "  We use the recently developed CFT techniques of Rychkov and Tan to compute\nanomalous dimensions in the $O(N)$ Gross-Neveu model in $d=2+\\epsilon$\ndimensions. To do this, we extend the \"cowpie contraction\" algorithm of\narXiv:1506.06616 to theories with fermions. Our results match perfectly with\nFeynman diagram computations.\n", "  The scalar mass is determined in the simplest scalar-fermion Yukawa-model in\nthe whole range of stability of the scalar potential. Two versions of the\nFunctional Renormalisation Group (FRG) equations are solved, where also\ncomposite fermionic background is taken into account. The close agreement of\nthe results with previous studies taking into account exclusively the effect of\nthe scalar condensate, supports a rather small systematic truncation error of\nFRG due to the omission of higher dimensional operators.\n", "  For transcendental functions that solve non-linear $q$-difference equations,\nthe best descriptions available are the ones obtained by expansion near\ncritical points at the origin and infinity. We describe such solutions of a\n$q$-discrete Painlev\\'e equation, with 7 parameters whose initial value space\nis a rational surface of type $A_1^{(1)}$. The resultant expansions are shown\nto approach series expansions of the classical sixth Painlev\\'e equation in the\ncontinuum limit.\n", "  It is proved that the acoustic-type dispersion of bending mode in graphene is\ngenerated by the fluctuation interaction between in-plane and out-of-plane\nterms in the free energy arising with account of non-linear components in the\ngraphene strain tensor. In doing so we use an original adiabatic approximation\nbased on the alleged (confirmed a posteriori) significant difference of sound\nspeeds for in-plane and bending modes. The explicit expression for the bending\nsound speed depending only on the graphene mass density, in-plane elastic\nconstants and temperature is deduced as well as the characteristics of the\nmicroscopic corrugations of graphene. The obtained results are in good\nquantitative agreement with the data of real experiments and computer\nsimulations.\n", "  A novel geometric interpretation of the solutions of the WDVV equations\nformerly found by A.P. Veselov is suggested.\n", "  Topological insulators constitute a new and fascinating class of matter with\ninsulating bulk yet metallic surfaces that host highly mobile charge carriers\nwith spin-momentum locking. Remarkably, the direction and magnitude of surface\ncurrents can be controlled with tailored light beams, but the underlying\nmechanisms are not yet well understood. To directly resolve the \"birth\" of such\nphotocurrents we need to boost the time resolution to the scale of elementary\nscattering events ($\\sim$ 10 fs). Here, we excite and measure photocurrents in\nthe three-dimensional model topological insulator $\\mathrm{Bi}_2\\mathrm{Se}_3$\nwith a time resolution as short as 20 fs by sampling the concomitantly emitted\nbroadband THz electromagnetic field from 1 to 40 THz. Remarkably, the ultrafast\nsurface current response is dominated by a charge transfer along the Se-Bi\nbonds. In contrast, photon-helicity-dependent photocurrents are found to have\norders of magnitude smaller magnitude than expected from generation scenarios\nbased on asymmetric depopulation of the Dirac cone. Our findings are also of\ndirect relevance for optoelectronic devices based on topological-insulator\nsurface currents.\n", "  At present, the best model for the evolution of the cosmos requires that dark\nmatter make up approximately $25\\%$ of the energy content of the Universe. Most\napproaches to explain the microscopic nature of dark matter, to date, have\nassumed its composition to be of intrinsically weakly interacting particles;\nhowever, this need not be the case to have consistency with all extant\nobservations. Given decades of inconclusive evidence to support any dark matter\ncandidate, there is strong motivation to consider alternatives to the standard\nparticle scenario. One such example is macro dark matter, a class of candidates\n(macros) that could interact strongly with the particles of the Standard Model,\nhave large masses and physical sizes, and yet behave as dark matter. Macros\nthat scatter completely inelastically could have altered the primordial\nproduction of the elements, and macro charge-dependent constraints have been\nobtained previously. Here we reconsider the phenomenology of inelastically\ninteracting macros on the abundance of primordially produced $^4\\text{He}$ and\nrevise previous constraints by also taking into account improved measurements\nof the primordial $^4\\text{He}$ abundance. The constraints derived here are\nlimited in applicability to only leptophobic macros that have a surface\npotential $V \\gtrsim 0.5\\,$MeV. However, an important conclusion from our\nanalysis is that even neutral macros would likely affect the abundance of the\nlight elements. Therefore, constraints on that scenario are possible and are\ncurrently an open question.\n", "  In these lecture notes, prepared for the Microswimmers Summer School 2015 at\nForschungszentrum Juelich, I discuss the well known Vicsek model for collective\nmotion and its main properties. In particular, I discuss its algorithmical\nimplementation and the basic properties of its universality class. I present\nresults from numerical simulations and insist on the role played by symmetries\nand conservation laws. Analytical arguments are presented in an accessible and\nsimplified way, but ample references are given for more advanced readings.\n", "  The development of the $\\beta^-$ based radio-guided surgery aims to extend\nthe technique to those tumours where surgery is the only possible treatment and\nthe assessment of the resection would most profit from the low background\naround the lesion, as for brain tumours. Feasibility studies on meningioma,\nglioma, and neuroendocrine tumors already estimated the potentiality of this\nnew treatment. To validate the technique, prototypes of the intraoperative\nprobe required by the technique to detect $\\beta^-$ radiation have been\ndeveloped. This paper discusses the design details of the device and the tests\nperformed in laboratory. In such tests particular care has to be taken to\nreproduce the surgical field conditions. The innovative technique to produce\nspecific phantoms and the dedicated testing protocols is described in detail.\n", "  Above a certain density a granular material jams. This property can be\ncontrolled by either tuning a global property, such as the packing fraction or\nby applying shear strain, or at the micro-scale by tuning grain shape,\ninter-particle friction or externally controlled organization. Here, we\nintroduce a novel way to change a local granular property by adding a weak\nanisotropic magnetic interaction between particles. We measure the evolution of\nthe pressure, $P$, and coordination number, $Z$, for a packing of 2D\nphoto-elastic disks, subject to uniaxial compression. Some of the particles\nhave embedded cuboidal magnets. The strength of the magnetic interactions\nbetween particles are too weak to have a strong direct effect on $P$ or $Z$\nwhen the system is jammed. However, the magnetic interactions play an important\nrole in the evolution of latent force networks when systems containing a large\nenough fraction of the particles with magnets are driven through unjammed\nstates. In this case, a statistically stable network of magnetic chains\nself-organizes and overlaps with force chains, strengthening the granular\nmedium. We believe this property can be used to reversibly control mechanical\nproperties of granular materials.\n", "  We present analytic solution of the\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) equation at leading order\n(LO) in the phi^3 theory in 6 space-time dimensions. If the phi^3 model was the\ntheory of strong interactions, the obtained solution would describe the\ndistribution of partons in a jet. We point out that the local parton-hadron\nduality (LPHD) conjecture does not work in this hypothetical situation. That\nis, treatment of hadronisation of shower partons is essential for the\ndescription of hadron distributions in jets stemming from proton-proton (pp)\ncollisions at \\sqrt{s} = 7 TeV and from electron-positron (e+e-) annihilations\nat various collision energies. We use a statistical model for the description\nof hadronisation.\n", "  We discuss prospects for probing short-range sterile neutrino oscillation\nusing neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering with ultra-low energy ($\\sim 10$ eV\n- 100 eV) recoil threshold cryogenic Ge detectors. The analysis is performed in\nthe context of a specific and contemporary reactor-based experimental proposal,\ndeveloped in cooperation with the Nuclear Science Center at Texas A\\&M\nUniversity, and references developing technology based upon economical and\nscalable detector arrays. The baseline of the experiment is substantially\nshorter than existing measurements, as near as about 2 meters from the reactor\ncore, and is moreover variable, extending continuously up to a range of about\n10 meters. This proximity and variety combine to provide extraordinary\nsensitivity to a wide spectrum of oscillation scales, while facilitating the\ntidy cancellation of leading systematic uncertainties in the reactor source and\nenvironment. With 100~eV sensitivity, for exposures on the order of 200\nkg$\\cdot$y, we project an estimated sensitivity to first/fourth neutrino\noscillation with a mass gap $\\Delta m^2 \\sim 1 \\, {\\rm eV}^2$ at an amplitude\n$\\sin^2 2\\theta \\sim 10^{-1}$, or $\\Delta m^2 \\sim 0.2 \\, {\\rm eV}^2$ at unit\namplitude. Larger exposures, around 5,000 kg$\\cdot$y, together with 10 eV\nsensitivity are capable of probing more than an additional order of magnitude\nin amplitude.\n", "  We provide analytical and numerical evidence of a spin-triplet FFLO\nsuperconductivity in the itinerant Kitaev-Heisenberg model (anti-ferromagnetic\nKitaev coupling and ferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling) on the honeycomb lattice\naround quarter filling. The strong spin-orbit coupling in our model leads to\nthe emergence of 6 inversion symmetry centers for the Fermi surface at non zero\nmomenta in the first Brillouin zone. We show how the Cooper pairs condense into\nthese non-trivial momenta, causing the spatial modulation of the\nsuperconducting order parameter. Applying a Ginzburg-Landau expansion analysis,\nwe find that the superconductivity has three separated degenerate ground states\nwith three different spin-triplet pairings. This picture is also supported by\nexact diagonalizations on finite clusters.\n", "  The equations for gravitational plane waves produced by a typical binary\nsystem as a solution of linear approximation of Einstein equations is derived.\nThe dynamics of the corresponding gravitational field is analyzed in a\n4-dimensional space-time manifold, endowed with a metric and taking into\naccount the torsion. In this context, the geometrical reason of the existence\nof torsion due to the presence of gravitational waves, as an asymmetry of\nconnection coefficients with respect of the swapping of indices's is\nhighlighted. In a laser interferometer gravitational detector The delay time\nbetween the arrivals of the two laser beams traveling back and forth along the\ntwo arms of in presence of gravitational waves, is interpreted from this point\nof view. The geometrical interpretation of torsion, links this delay time to\nthe breaking of the parallelogram formed by the trajectories of the laser beams\nin space-time. This delay is calculated for a typical NS-NS binary pulsar in\ntwo specific orientations with respect of the experimental device,\ncorresponding to different polarizations of the gravitational waves. These\nvalues are related to the relative length variation of the detector's arms in\npresence of gravitational waves, and shown to be completely equivalent to the\nresults obtained in the context of the standard General Relativity.\n", "  We introduce a novel, two-mass system that slides up an inclined plane while\nits center of mass moves down. The system consists of two identical masses\nconnected by an ideal string symmetrically placed over a corner-shaped support.\nThis system is similar to a double-cone that rolls up an inclined set of\nV-shaped rails. We find the double-cone's motion easy to demonstrate but\ndifficult to analyze. Our example here is more straightforward to follow, and\nthe experimental observations are in good agreement with the theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  We construct a class of generalized non-local gravity (GNLG) model which is\nthe modified theory of general relativity (GR) obtained by adding a term\n$m^{2n-2} R\\Box^{-n}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Concretely, we not only\nstudy the gravitational equation for the GNLG model by introducing auxiliary\nscalar fields, but also analyse the classical stability and examine the\ncosmological consequences of the model for different exponent $n$. We find that\nthe half of the scalar fields are always ghost-like and the exponent $n$ must\nbe taken even number for a stable GNLG model. Meanwhile, the model\nspontaneously generates three dominant phases of the evolution of the universe,\nand the equation of state parameters turn out to be phantom-like. Furthermore,\nwe clarify in another way that exponent $n$ should be even numbers by discuss\nthe spherically symmetric static solutions in Newtonian gauge. It is worth\nstressing that the results given by us can include ones in refs. [28, 34] as\nthe special case of $n=2$.\n", "  Context. Friends-of-friends algorithms are a common tool to detect galaxy\ngroups and clusters in large survey data. In order to be as precise as\npossible, they have to be carefully calibrated using mock catalogues.\n  Aims. We create an accurate and robust description of the matter distribution\nin the local Universe using the most up-to-date available data. This will\nprovide the input for a specific cosmological test planned as follow-up to this\nwork, and will be useful for general extragalactic and cosmological research.\n  Methods. We created a set of galaxy group catalogues based on the 2MRS and\nSDSS DR12 galaxy samples using a friends-of-friends based group finder\nalgorithm. The algorithm was carefully calibrated and optimised on a new set of\nwide-angle mock catalogues from the Millennium simulation, in order to provide\naccurate total mass estimates of the galaxy groups taking into account the\nrelevant observational biases in 2MRS and SDSS.\n  Results. We provide four different catalogues (i) a 2MRS based group\ncatalogue; (ii) an SDSS DR12 based group catalogue reaching out to a redshift z\n= 0.11 with stellar mass estimates for 70% of the galaxies; (iii) a catalogue\nproviding additional fundamental plane distances for all groups of the SDSS\ncatalogue that host elliptical galaxies; (iv) a catalogue of the mass\ndistribution in the local Universe based on a combination of our 2MRS and SDSS\ncatalogues.\n  Conclusions. While motivated by a specific cosmological test, three of the\nfour catalogues that we produced are well suited to act as reference databases\nfor a variety of extragalactic and cosmological science cases. Our catalogue of\nfundamental plane distances for SDSS groups provides further added value to\nthis paper.\n", "  Droplets splash when they impact dry, flat substrates above a critical\nvelocity that depends on parameters such as droplet size, viscosity and air\npressure. By imaging ethanol drops impacting silicone gels of different\nstiffnesses we show that substrate stiffness also affects the splashing\nthreshold. Splashing is reduced or even eliminated: droplets on the softest\nsubstrates need over 70\\% more kinetic energy to splash than they do on rigid\nsubstrates. We show that this is due to energy losses caused by deformations of\nsoft substrates during the first few microseconds of impact. We find that\nsolids with Young's moduli $\\lesssim 100$kPa reduce splashing, in agreement\nwith simple scaling arguments. Thus materials like soft gels and elastomers can\nbe used as simple coatings for effective splash prevention. Soft substrates\nalso serve as a useful system for testing splash-formation theories and\nsheet-ejection mechanisms, as they allow the characteristics of ejection sheets\nto be controlled independently of the bulk impact dynamics of droplets.\n", "  Using an advanced version of the hadron resonance gas model we have found\nseveral remarkable irregularities at chemical freeze-out. The most prominent of\nthem are two sets of highly correlated quasi-plateaus in the collision energy\ndependence of the entropy per baryon, total pion number per baryon, and thermal\npion number per baryon which we found at center of mass energies 3.6-4.9 GeV\nand 7.6-10 GeV. The low energy set of quasi-plateaus was predicted a long time\nago. On the basis of the generalized shock-adiabat model we demonstrate that\nthe low energy correlated quasi-plateaus give evidence for the anomalous\nthermodynamic properties of the mixed phase at its boundary to the quark-gluon\nplasma. The question is whether the high energy correlated quasi-plateaus are\nalso related to some kind of mixed phase. In order to answer this question we\nemploy the results of a systematic meta-analysis of the quality of data\ndescription of 10 existing event generators of nucleus-nucleus collisions in\nthe range of center of mass collision energies from 3.1 GeV to 17.3 GeV. These\ngenerators are divided into two groups: the first group includes the generators\nwhich account for the quark-gluon plasma formation during nuclear collisions,\nwhile the second group includes the generators which do not assume the\nquark-gluon plasma formation in such collisions. Comparing the quality of data\ndescription of more than a hundred of different data sets of strange hadrons by\nthese two groups of generators, we find two regions of the equal quality of\ndata description which are located at the center of mass collision energies\n4.3-4.9 GeV and 10.-13.5 GeV. These two regions of equal quality of data\ndescription we interpret as regions of the hadron-quark-gluon mixed phase\nformation.\n", "  We have studied the hadronization of jet parton showers based on the quark\nrecombination model. This is achieved by letting gluons at the end of the\nperturbative shower evolution undergo a non-perturbative splitting into quark\nand antiquark pairs, then applying a Monte-Carlo version of instantaneous quark\nrecombination, and finally subjecting remnant quarks (those which have not\nfound a recombination partner) to Lund string fragmentation. When applied to\nparton showers from the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator, the final hadron spectra\nfrom our calculation compare quite well to PYTHIA jets that have been\nhadronized with the default Lund string fragmentation. Modeling the quark gluon\nplasma produced in heavy ion collisions by a blast wave model, we have further\nstudied medium effects on the hadronization of jet shower partons by also\nincluding their recombination with the thermal partons from the quark gluon\nplasma. We find that the latter leads to a significant enhancement of\nintermediate transverse momentum pions and protons at both RHIC and LHC. Our\nresults thus suggest that medium modification of jet fragmentation provides a\nplausible explanation for the enhanced production of intermediate transverse\nmomentum hadrons observed in experiments.\n", "  Considering the importance of Lorentz invariance and chiral symmetry, we\nadopt the saturated Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model to study the density\ndependence of the symmetry energy. The super-soft symmetry energy can be\nobtained from introducing a chiral isovector-vector interaction in the\nlagrangian, but should be ruled out by the neutron star (NS) stability in the\nmean-field approximation. It is found that the isovector-scalar interaction in\nthe NJL model can play an important role in softening of the symmetry energy.\nWe have investigated NS properties. The NS maximum mass obtained with various\nisovector-scalar couplings and momentum cutoffs is well above the $2M_\\odot$,\nand the NS radius obtained well meets the limits extracted from recent\nmeasurements.\n", "  In the curvaton scenario, primordial curvature perturbations are produced by\na second field that is sub-dominant during inflation. Depending on how the\ncurvaton decays [possibly producing baryon number, lepton number, or cold dark\nmatter (CDM)], mixtures of correlated isocurvature perturbations are produced,\nallowing the curvaton scenario to be tested using cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) data. Here, a full range of 27 curvaton-decay scenarios is compared with\nCMB data, placing limits on the curvaton fraction at decay, $r_D$, and the\nlepton asymmetry, $\\xi_{\\rm lep}$. If baryon number is generated by curvaton\ndecay and CDM before (or vice-versa), these limits imply specific predictions\nfor non-Gaussian signatures testable by future CMB experiments and upcoming\nlarge-scale-structure surveys.\n", "  The octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and $\\delta_{CP}$ are the two major unknowns in\nneutrino oscillation physics. The precise determination of octant and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ is interlinked through the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. In\nthis paper we study the proficiency of the DUNE experiment to determine these\nparameters, in particular, the role played by the antineutrinos, the broadband\nnature of the beam and the matter effect. For $P_{\\mu e}$ and $P_{\\bar{\\mu}\n\\bar{e}}$ the octant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy occurs at different values of\n$\\delta_{CP}$, combination of neutrino and antineutrino runs help to resolve\nthis. However, in regions where neutrinos do not have octant degeneracy adding\nantineutrino data is expected to decrease the sensitivity because of the\ndegeneracy and reduced statistics. However we find that in case of DUNE\nbaseline, the antineutrino runs help even in parameter space where the\nantineutrino probabilities suffer from degeneracies. We explore this point in\ndetail and point out that this happens because of the (i) broad-band nature of\nthe beam so that even if there is degeneracy at a particular energy bin, over\nthe whole spectrum the degeneracy may not be there; (ii) the enhanced matter\neffect due to the comparatively longer baseline which creates an increased\ntension between the neutrino and the antineutrino probabilities which raises\nthe overall $\\chi^2$ in case of combined runs. This feature is more prominent\nfor IH since the antineutrino probabilities in this case are much higher than\nthe neutrino probabilities due to matter effects. The main role of\nantineutrinos in enhancing CP sensitivity is their ability to remove the\noctant-$\\delta_{CP}$ degeneracy. However even if one assumes octant to be known\nthe addition of antineutrinos can give enhanced CP sensitivity in some\nparameter regions due to the tension between the neutrino and antineutrino\n$\\chi^2$s.\n", "  A new non-perturbative, gauge-invariant model QCD renormalization is applied\nto high energy elastic pp-scattering. The differential cross-section deduced\nfrom this model displays a diffraction dip that resembles those of experiments.\nComparison with ISR and LHC data is currently underway.\n", "  This work concerns the boundary integrability of the\n${\\cal{U}}_{q}[osp(1|2)]$ Temperley-Lieb model. We constructed the solutions of\nthe graded reflection equations in order to determine the boundary terms of the\ncorrespondig spin-1 Hamiltonian. We obtain the eigenvalue expressions as well\nas its associated Bethe ansatz equations by means of the coordinate Bethe\nansatz. These equations provide the complete description of the spectrum of the\nmodel with diagonal integrable boundaries.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that a cloud of cold atoms with a size\ncomparable to the wavelength of light can induce large group delays on a laser\npulse when the laser is tightly focused on it and is close to an atomic\nresonance. Delays as large as -10 ns are observed, corresponding to\n\"superluminal\" propagation with negative group velocities as low as -300 m/s.\nStrikingly, this large delay is associated with a moderate extinction owing to\nthe very small size of the cloud and to the light-induced interactions between\natoms. It implies that a large phase shift is imprinted on the continuous laser\nbeam, and opens interesting perspectives for applications to quantum\ntechnologies.\n", "  Diamond is a proven solid-state platform for spin-based quantum technology.\nThe nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been used to realize\nsmall-scale quantum information processing (QIP) and quantum sensing under\nambient conditions. A major barrier in the development of large-scale QIP in\ndiamond is the connection of NV spin registers by a quantum bus at room\ntemperature. Given that diamond is expected to be an ideal spin transport\nmaterial, the coherent transport of spin directly between the spin registers\noffers a potential solution. Yet, there has been no demonstration of spin\ntransport in diamond due to difficulties in achieving spin injection and\ndetection via conventional methods. Here, we exploit detailed knowledge of the\nparamagnetic defects in diamond to identify novel mechanisms to achieve spin\ninjection, transport and detection in diamond at room temperature. Having\nidentified these mechanisms, we explore how they may be combined to realise an\non-chip spin quantum bus.\n", "  We calculate the rate of production of hypothetical light vector bosons\n(LVBs) from nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung reactions in the soft radiation\nlimit directly in terms of the measured nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections.\nWe use these results and the observation of neutrinos from supernova SN1987a to\ndeduce constraints on the couplings of vector bosons with masses $\\lesssim 200$\nMeV to either electric charge (dark photons) or to baryon number. We establish\nfor the first time strong constraints on LVB that couple only to baryon number,\nand revise earlier constraints on the dark photon. For the latter, we find that\nthe excluded region of parameter space is diminished by about a factor of 10.\n", "  The scattering equations, originally introduced by Fairlie and Roberts in\n1972 and more recently shown by Cachazo, He and Yuan to provide a kinematic\nbasis for describing tree amplitudes for massless particles in arbitrary\nspace-time dimension, have been reformulated in polynomial form. The scattering\nequations for N particles are equivalent to N-3 polynomial equations h_m=0,\nm=1,...,N-3, in N-3 variables, where h_m has degree m and is linear in the\nindividual variables. Facilitated by this linearity, elimination theory is used\nto construct a single variable polynomial equation of degree (N-3)! determining\nthe solutions. \\Delta_N is the sparse resultant of the system of polynomial\nscattering equations and it can be identified as the hyperdeterminant of a\nmultidimensional matrix of border format within the terminology of Gel'fand,\nKapranov and Zelevinsky. Macaulay's Unmixedness Theorem is used to show that\nthe polynomials of the scattering equations constitute a regular sequence,\nenabling the Hilbert series of the variety determined by the scattering\nequations to be calculated, independently showing that they have (N-3)!\nsolutions.\n", "  The neutron star ocean is a plasma of ions and electrons that extends from\nthe base of the neutron star's envelope to a depth where the plasma\ncrystallizes into a solid crust. During an accretion outburst in an X-ray\ntransient, material accumulates in the envelope of the neutron star primary.\nThis accumulation compresses the neutron star's outer layers and induces\nnuclear reactions in the ocean and crust. Accretion-driven heating raises the\nocean's temperature and increases the frequencies of g-modes in the ocean; when\naccretion halts, the ocean cools and ocean g-mode frequencies decrease. If the\nobserved low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations on accreting neutron stars\nare g-modes in the ocean, the observed quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies\nwill increase during outburst---reaching a maximum when the ocean temperature\nreaches steady state --- and subsequently decrease during quiescence. For\ntime-averaged accretion rates during outbursts between $\\langle \\dot{M} \\rangle\n= 0.1 \\textrm{--} 1.0\\, \\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$ the predicted g-mode fundamental\n$n=1$ $l=2$ frequency is between $\\approx 3 \\textrm{--} 7 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ for\nslowly rotating neutron stars. Accreting neutron stars that require extra\nshallow heating, such as the Z-sources MAXI J0556-332, MXB 1659-29, and XTE\nJ1701-462, have predicted g-mode fundamental frequencies between $\\approx 3\n\\textrm{--} 16 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$. Therefore, observations of low-frequency\nquasi-periodic oscillations between $\\approx 8 \\textrm{--} 16\\, \\mathrm{Hz}$ in\nthese sources, or in other transients that require shallow heating, will\nsupport a g-mode origin for the observed quasi-periodic oscillations.\n", "  A new exact and analytic solution of non-relativistic fireball hydrodynamics\nis presented. It describes an expanding triaxial ellipsoid that rotates around\none of its principal axes. The observables are calculated using simple analytic\nformulas. Azimuthal oscillation of the off-diagonal Bertsch-Pratt radii of\nBose-Einstein correlations as well as rapidity dependent directed and third\nflow measurements provide means to determine the magnitude of the rotation of\nthe fireball. Observing this rotation and its dependence on collision energy\nmay lead to new information on the equation of state of the strongly\ninteracting quark gluon plasma produced in high energy heavy ion collisions.\n", "  In this work we analyze the possibility to explain the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment discrepancy within theory and experiment through lepton flavor\nviolation processes. We propose a flavor extended MSSM by considering a\nhierarchical family structure for the trilinear scalar Soft-Supersymmetric\nterms of the Lagranagian, present at the SUSY breaking scale. We obtain\nanalytical results for the rotation mass matrix, with the consequence of having\nnon-universal slepton masses and the possibility of leptonic flavour mixing.\nThe one-loop supersymmetric contributions to the leptonic flavour violating\nprocess $\\tau \\to \\mu\\gamma$ are calculated in the physical basis, with slepton\nflavour mixed states, instead of using the well known Mass Insertion Method. We\npresent the regions in parameter space where the muon g-2 problem is either\nentirely solved or partially reduced through the contribution of these flavor\nviolating processes.\n", "  High finesse frequency combs (HFC) with large ratio of the frequency spacing\nto the width of the spectral components have demonstrated remarkable results in\nmany applications such as precision spectroscopy and metrology. We found that\nlow finesse frequency combs having very small ratio of the frequency spacing to\nthe width of the spectral components are more sensitive to the exact resonance\nwith absorber than HFC. Our method is based on time domain measurements\nreviling oscillations of the radiation intensity after passing through an\noptically thick absorber. Fourier analysis of the oscillations allows to\nreconstruct the spectral content of the comb. If the central component of the\nincident comb is in exact resonance with the single line absorber, the\ncontribution of the first sideband frequency into oscillations is exactly zero.\nWe demonstrate this technique with gamma-photon absorbtion by M\\\"{o}ssbauer\nnuclei providing the spectral resolution beyond the natural broadening.\n", "  We study analytically quantum tunneling of relativistic and non-relativistic\nparticles at both Killing and universal horizons of Einstein-Maxwell-aether\nblack holes, after high-order curvature corrections are taken into account, for\nwhich the dispersion relation of the particles becomes nonlinear. Our results\nat the Killing horizons confirm the previous ones, i.e., at high frequencies\nthe corresponding radiation remains thermal and the nonlinearity of the\ndispersion does not alter the Hawking radiation significantly. In contrary,\nnon-relativistic particles are created at universal horizons and are radiated\nout to infinity. The radiation also has a thermal spectrum, and the\ncorresponding temperature takes the form, $T^{z}_{UH} = 2\\kappa_{UH}\n(z-1)/(2\\pi z)$, where $z$ denotes the power of the leading term in the\nnonlinear dispersion relation, $\\kappa_{UH}$ is the surface gravity of the\nuniversal horizon, defined by peering behavior of ray trajectories at the\nuniversal horizon. We also study the Smarr formula by assuming that: (a) the\nentropy is proportional to the area of the universal horizon, and (b) the first\nlaw of black hole thermodynamics holds, whereby we derive the Smarr mass, which\nin general is different from the total mass obtained at infinity. This\nindicates that one or both of these assumptions must be modified.\n", "  The vast majority of modern microelectronic devices rely on carriers within\nsemiconductors due to their integrability. Therefore, the performance of these\ndevices is limited due to natural semiconductor properties such as band gap and\nelectron velocity. Replacing the semiconductor channel in conventional\nmicroelectronic devices with a gas or vacuum channel may scale their speed,\nwavelength, and power beyond what is available today. However, liberating\nelectrons into gas/vacuum in a practical microelectronic device is quite\nchallenging. It often requires heating, applying high voltages, or using lasers\nwith short wavelengths or high powers. Here, we show that the interaction\nbetween an engineered resonant surface (metasurface) and a low-power infrared\n(IR) laser can cause enough photoemission (via electron tunneling) to implement\nfeasible microelectronic devices such as transistors, switches, and modulators.\nPhotoemission-based devices benefit from the advantages of gas-plasma/vacuum\nelectronic devices while preserving the integrability of semiconductor-based\ndevices.\n", "  The Precision Reactor Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment, PROSPECT, is\ndesigned to make a precise measurement of the antineutrino spectrum from a\nhighly-enriched uranium reactor and probe eV-scale sterile neutrinos by\nsearching for neutrino oscillations over meter-long distances. PROSPECT is\nconceived as a 2-phase experiment utilizing segmented $^6$Li-doped liquid\nscintillator detectors for both efficient detection of reactor antineutrinos\nthrough the inverse beta decay reaction and excellent background\ndiscrimination. PROSPECT Phase I consists of a movable 3-ton antineutrino\ndetector at distances of 7 - 12 m from the reactor core. It will probe the\nbest-fit point of the $\\nu_e$ disappearance experiments at 4$\\sigma$ in 1 year\nand the favored region of the sterile neutrino parameter space at $>$3$\\sigma$\nin 3 years. With a second antineutrino detector at 15 - 19 m from the reactor,\nPhase II of PROSPECT can probe the entire allowed parameter space below 10\neV$^{2}$ at 5$\\sigma$ in 3 additional years. The measurement of the reactor\nantineutrino spectrum and the search for short-baseline oscillations with\nPROSPECT will test the origin of the spectral deviations observed in recent\n$\\theta_{13}$ experiments, search for sterile neutrinos, and conclusively\naddress the hypothesis of sterile neutrinos as an explanation of the reactor\nanomaly.\n", "  Active Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (APRS) denotes a class of diagnostic\ntechniques which utilize the natural ability of plasmas to resonate on or near\nthe electron plasma frequency. One particular class of APRS can be described in\nan abstract notation based on functional analytic methods in electrostatic\napproximation. These methods allow for a general solution of the kinetic model\nin arbitrary geometry. This solution is given as the response function of the\nprobe-plasma system and is defined by the resolvent of an appropriate dynamical\noperator. The general response predicts an additional damping due to kinetic\neffects. This manuscript provides the derivation of an explicit response\nfunction of the kinetic APRS model in a simple geometry. Therefore, the\nresolvent is determined by its matrix representation based on an expansion in\northogonal basis functions. This allows to compute an approximated response\nfunction. The resulting spectra show clearly a stronger damping due to kinetic\neffects.\n", "  We study Kolmogorov flow on a three dimensional, periodic domain with aspect\nratios fixed to unity. Using an energy method, we give a concise proof of the\nlinear stability of the laminar flow profile. Since turbulent motion is\nobserved for high enough Reynolds numbers, we expect the domain of attraction\nof the laminar flow to be bounded by the stable manifolds of simple invariant\nsolutions. We show one such edge state to be an equilibrium with a spatial\nstructure reminiscent of that found in plane Couette flow, with stream wise\nrolls on the largest spatial scales. When tracking the edge state, we find an\nupper and a lower branch solution that join in a saddle node bifurcation at\nfinite Reynolds number.\n", "  We introduce a new Adaptive Integration Approach (AIA) to be used in a wide\nrange of molecular simulations. Given a simulation problem and a step size, the\nmethod automatically chooses the optimal scheme out of an available family of\nnumerical integrators. Although we focus on two-stage splitting integrators,\nthe idea may be used with more general families. In each instance, the\nsystem-specific integrating scheme identified by our approach is optimal in the\nsense that it provides the best conservation of energy for harmonic forces. The\nAIA method has been implemented in the BCAM-modified GROMACS software package.\nNumerical tests in molecular dynamics and hybrid Monte Carlo simulations of\nconstrained and unconstrained physical systems show that the method\nsuccessfully realises the fail-safe strategy. In all experiments, and for each\nof the criteria employed, the AIA is at least as good as, and often\nsignificantly outperforms the standard Verlet scheme, as well as fixed\nparameter, optimized two-stage integrators. In particular, the sampling\nefficiency found in simulations using the AIA is up to 5 times better than the\none achieved with other tested schemes.\n", "  The study of event-by-event fluctuations of identified hadrons may reveal the\ndegrees of freedom of the strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion\ncollisions and the underlying dynamics of the system. The observable\n$\\nu_{dyn}$, which is defined in terms of the moments of identified-particle\nmultiplicity distributions, is used to quantify the magnitude of the dynamical\nfluctuations in event-by-event measurements of particle ratios. The ALICE\ndetector at the LHC is well-suited for the study of $\\nu_{dyn}$, due to its\nexcellent particle identification capabilities. Particle identification based\non the measurement of the specific ionisation energy loss, d$E$/d$x$, works\nwell on a statistical basis but suffers from ambiguities when applied on an\nevent-by-event level. A novel experimental technique called the \"Identity\nMethod\" is used to overcome such limitations. The first results on identified\nparticle ratio fluctuations in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76TeV in\nALICE as a function of centrality are presented. The ALICE results for the most\nperipheral events indicate an increasing correlation between pions and protons\nwhich is not reproduced by the HIJING and AMPT models. On the other hand, for\nthe most central events the ALICE results agree with the extrapolations based\non the data at lower energies from CERN-SPS and RHIC.\n", "  NASA's Kepler Mission uncovered a wealth of planetary systems, many with\nplanets on short-period orbits. These short-period systems reside around 50% of\nSun-like stars and are similarly prevalent around M dwarfs. Their formation and\nsubsequent evolution is the subject of active debate. In this paper, we\nsimulate late-stage, in-situ planet formation across a grid of planetesimal\ndisks with varying surface density profiles and total mass. We compare\nsimulation results with observable characteristics of the Kepler sample. We\nidentify mixture models with different primordial planetesimal disk properties\nthat self-consistently recover the multiplicity, period ratio and duration\nratio distributions of the Kepler planets. We draw three main conclusions: (1)\nWe favor a \"frozen-in\" narrative for systems of short period planets, in which\nthey are stable over long timescales, as opposed to metastable. (2) The \"Kepler\ndichotomy\", an observed phenomenon of the Kepler sample wherein the\narchitectures of planetary systems appear to either vary significantly or have\nmultiple modes, can naturally be explained by formation within planetesimal\ndisks with varying surface density profiles. Finally, (3) we quantify the\nnature of the \"Kepler dichotomy\" for both GK stars and M dwarfs, and find that\nit varies with stellar type. While the mode of planet formation that accounts\nfor highly multiplistic systems occurs in 24+/-7% of planetary systems orbiting\nGK stars, it occurs in 63+/-16% of planetary systems orbiting M dwarfs.\n", "  The ALICE Collaboration measures the production of low-mass dielectrons in\npp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The main detectors used in the\nanalyses are the Inner Tracking System, Time Projection Chamber and\nTime-Of-Flight detector, all located at mid-rapidity. The dielectron yield in\np-Pb collisions shows an overall agreement with the hadronic cocktail. The pair\ntransverse momentum distributions are sensitive to the contributions from open\nheavy-flavours. In Pb-Pb collisions, uncorrected background-subtracted yields\nhave been extracted in two centrality classes. In pp collisions the production\nof virtual photons relative to the inclusive yield is determined by analyzing\nthe dielectron excess with respect to the expected hadronic sources. The direct\nphoton cross section is then calculated and found to be in agreement with NLO\npQCD calculations. A feasibility study for LHC Run 3 after the ALICE upgrade\nindicates the possibility for a future measurement of the early effective\ntemperature.\n", "  Nuclear matter under extreme conditions can be investigated in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The measurement of transverse momentum\ndistributions and yields of identified particles is a fundamental step in\nunderstanding collective and thermal properties of the matter produced in such\ncollisions. The ALICE Experiment results on identified charged hadron\nproduction are presented for pp collisions at \\sqrt{s} = 0.9, 2.76 and 7 TeV\nand for Pb-Pb collisions at \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV. Spectral shapes,\nproduction yields and nuclear modification factors are shown and compared to\nprevious experiments and Monte Carlo predictions. The spectral shapes in Pb-Pb\ncollisions indicate a strong increase of the radial flow velocity with respect\nto RHIC energies, which in hydrodynamic models is expected as a consequence of\nthe increasing particle density. The observed suppression of high transverse\nmomentum particles in central Pb-Pb collisions provides evidence for strong\nparton energy loss in the hot and dense medium.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a method to describe the many-body problem of\nelectrons in honeycomb materials via the introduction of random fields which\nare coupled to the electrons and have a Gaussian distribution. From a one-body\napproach to the problem, after integrating exactly the contribution of the\nrandom fields, one builds a non-hermitian and dissipative effective Hamiltonian\nwith two-body interactions. Our approach introduces besides the usual average\nover the electron field a second average over the random fields. The interplay\nof two averages enables the definition of various types of Green's functions\nwhich allow the investigation of fluctuation-dissipation characteristics of the\ninteractions that are a manifestation of the many-body problem. In the current\nwork we study only the dissipative term, through the perturbative analysis of\nthe dynamics associated the effective Hamiltonian generated by two different\nkinds of couplings. For the cases analysed, the eigenstates of the effective\nHamiltonian are complex and, therefore, some of the states have a finite life\ntime. Moreover, we also investigate, in the mean field approximation, the most\ngeneral parity conserving coupling to the random fields and compute the width\nof charge carriers $\\Gamma$ as a function of the Fermi energy $E_F$. The\ntheoretical prediction for $\\Gamma (E_F)$ is compared to the available\nexperimental data for graphene. The good agreement between $\\Gamma_{theo}$ and\n$\\Gamma_{exp}$ suggests that description of the many-body problem associated to\nthe electrons in honeycomb materials can indeed be done via the introduction of\nrandom fields.\n", "  The ALICE experiment has measured the direct photon spectra in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV for three different centrality\nselections. The measurement was performed emplying a method utilizing\nconversion of photons into $e^+e^-$ pairs in the detector material, and a\nmethod using the PHOS calorimeter. The two measurements were combined in order\nto measure direct photons over a broad transverse momentum range of $0.9 <\np_{\\rm T} < 14$ GeV/$c$. A direct photon signal was observed in the thermal\nregion $0.9 < p_{\\rm T} < 2.1$ GeV/$c$, with a significance of $2.6\\sigma$ in\nthe 20\\% most central collisions. The corresponding direct photon spectrum can\nbe described by an exponential with an inverse slope parameter of $(304 \\pm\n11^{\\rm stat} \\pm 40^{\\rm syst})$ MeV, without subtracting the hard scattering\ncomponent, which is somewhat larger than the inverse slope parameter of the\ndirect photon spectrum at RHIC energies. Within uncertainties, the data can be\ndescribed by different models for photon production in heavy-ion collisions.\nThese proceedings provide a summary of the results published in [1] and [2].\n", "  We compute the initial energy densities produced in ultrarelativistic\nheavy-ion collisions from NLO perturbative QCD using a saturation conjecture to\ncontrol soft particle production, and describe the subsequent space-time\nevolution of the system with hydrodynamics, event by event. The resulting\ncentrality dependence of the low-$p_T$ observables from this pQCD + saturation\n+ hydro (\"EKRT\") framework are then compared simultaneously to the LHC and RHIC\nmeasurements. With such an analysis we can test the initial state calculation,\nand constrain the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity-to-entropy\nratio $\\eta/s$ of QCD matter. Using these constraints from the current RHIC and\nLHC measurements we then predict the charged hadron multiplicities and flow\ncoefficients for the 5.023 TeV Pb+Pb collisions.\n", "  One of the key signatures of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), is the\nmodification of hadron transverse momentum differential cross-sections in\nheavy-ion collisions (HIC) as compared to proton-proton (pp) collisions.\nSuppression of hadron production at high transverse momenta (\\pt)~in HIC has\nbeen explained by the energy loss of the partons produced in the hard\nscattering processes which traverse the deconfined quantum chromodynamic (QCD)\nmatter. The dependence of the observed suppression on the \\pt~ of the measured\nhadron towards higher \\pt~ is an important input for the theoretical\nunderstanding of jet quenching effects in the QGP and the nature of the energy\nloss. The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) performs\nmeasurements of neutral meson inclusive spectra at mid-rapidity in a wide \\pt~\nrange in $pp$, $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions. Neutral mesons ($\\pi^{0}$, $\\eta$,\n$\\omega$) are reconstructed via complementary methods, using the ALICE\nelectromagnetic calorimeters, PHOS and EMCal, and by the central tracking\nsystem, identifying photons converted into $e^+e^-$ pairs in the material of\nthe inner barrel detectors (TPC and ITS). In this presentation, an overview of\ncurrent $\\pi^{0}$ and $\\eta$ measurements by the ALICE experiment in HIC and pp\ncollisions will be given.\n", "  In order to understand the experimental data on heavy quarkonium production\nin heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC it is necessary (though not sufficient)\nto pinpoint the properties of heavy $Q\\bar{Q}$ bound states in the deconfined\nquark-gluon plasma, including their dissolution. Here we present recent results\non the temperature dependence of bottomonium and charmonium correlators, as\nwell as their spectral functions in a lattice QCD based effective field theory\ncalled NRQCD, surveying temperatures close to the crossover transition $140\n{\\rm MeV} < T< 249 {\\rm MeV}$. The spectra are reconstructed based on a novel\nBayesian prescription, whose systematic uncertainties are assessed. We present\nindications for sequential melting of different quarkonium species with respect\nto their vacuum binding energies and give estimates on the survival of S-wave\nand P-wave ground states.\n", "  We report the first measurements of the correlation strength between various\nanisotropic flow harmonics, using ALICE data. This correlation strength is\ncharacterized with multi-particle cumulants of mixed harmonics, which by\nconstruction depend only on the fluctuations of magnitudes of the anisotropic\nflow vectors. A detailed comparison to theoretical model calculations,\nincluding HIJING, Monte Carlo Glauber and hydrodynamics is also presented.\nThese studies further constrain initial conditions, the properties and the\nevolution of the system to be used in theoretical simulations of heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n", "  The higher moments of the net charge distributions, e.g. the skewness and\nkurtosis, are studied within an infinite hadronic matter calculation in a\ntransport approach. By dividing the box into several parts, the volume\ndependence of the fluctuations is investigated. After confirming that the\ninitial distributions follow the expectations from a binomial distribution, the\ninfluence of quantum number conservation in this case the net charge in the\nsystem on the higher moments is evaluated. For this purpose, the composition of\nthe hadron gas is adjusted and only pions and $\\rho$ mesons are simulated to\ninvestigate the charge conservation effect. In addition, the effect of imposing\nkinematic cuts in momentum space is analysed. The role of resonance excitations\nand decays on the higher moments can also be studied within this model. This\nwork is highly relevant to understand the experimental measurements of higher\nmoments obtained in the RHIC beam energy scan and their comparison to lattice\nresults and other theoretical calculations assuming infinite matter.\n", "  We present a similarity transformation theory based on a polynomial form of a\nparticle-hole pair excitation operator. In the weakly correlated limit, this\npolynomial becomes an exponential, leading to coupled cluster doubles. In the\nopposite strongly correlated limit, the polynomial becomes an extended Bessel\nexpansion and yields the projected BCS wavefunction. In between, we interpolate\nusing a single parameter. The effective Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and this\nPolynomial Similarity Transformation Theory follows the philosophy of\ntraditional coupled cluster, left projecting the transformed Hamiltonian onto\nsubspaces of the Hilbert space in which the wave function variance is forced to\nbe zero. Similarly, the interpolation parameter is obtained through minimizing\nthe next residual in the projective hierarchy. We rationalize and demonstrate\nhow and why coupled cluster doubles is ill suited to the strongly correlated\nlimit whereas the Bessel expansion remains well behaved. The model provides\naccurate wave functions with energy errors that in its best variant are smaller\nthan 1\\% across all interaction stengths. The numerical cost is polynomial in\nsystem size and the theory can be straightforwardly applied to any realistic\nHamiltonian.\n", "  Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of correlations between composite\nsystems -- multipartite entanglement (ME) -- that, while puzzling our physical\nintuition, enable technologies not accessible in a classical world.\nNotwithstanding, there is still no efficient general method to theoretically\nquantify and experimentally detect ME. Here we propose a novel paradigm based\non the measurement of the statistical response of a quantum systems to a\ncollective parametric evolution. As a major difference with respect to current\napproaches based on the implementation of entanglement witness operators, we\nwitness ME without relying on measurement efficiencies or tomographic\nreconstructions of the quantum state. The protocol requires only two settings\nfor any number of parties. To illustrate its user-friendliness we demonstrate\nME in different experiments with ions and photons by analyzing published data\non fidelity visibilities and averaged observables.\n", "  The highest LHC energies give rise to production of many pairs of hard\npartons which deposit four-momentum into the expanding fireball matter. We\nargue that it is necessary to include momentum deposition during fireball\nevolution into 3+1 dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the collision. This\ninfluence cannot be accounted for simply by modifying initial conditions of the\nsimulation. The resulting contribution to flow anisotropy is correlated with\nthe fireball geometry and causes an increase of the elliptic flow in\nnon-central collisions. The results are presented for various scenarios with\nenergy and momentum deposition to clearly demonstrate this effect.\n", "  On the occasion of a century from the proposal of General relativity by\nEinstein, I attempt to tackle some open issues in modern cosmology, via a toy\nbut non-trivial model. Specifically, I would like to link together: (i) the\nsmallness of the cosmological constant today, (ii) the evolution of the\nuniverse from an inflationary era after the big-bang till now, and (iii) local\nsupersymmetry in the gravitational sector (supergravity) with a broken spectrum\nat early eras, by making use of the concept of the \"running vacuum\" in the\ncontext of a simple toy model of four-dimensional N=1 supergravity. The model\nis characterised by dynamically broken local supersymmetry, induced by the\nformation of gravitino condensates in the early universe. As I will argue,\nthere is a Starobinsky-type inflationary era characterising the broken\nsupersymmetry phase in this model, which is compatible with the current\ncosmological data, provided a given constraint is satisfied among some\ntree-level parameters of the model and the renormalised cosmological constant\nof the de Sitter background used in the analysis. Applying the \"running vacuum\"\nconcept, then, to the effective field theory at the exit of inflation, makes a\nsmooth connection (in cosmic time) with the radiation dominance epoch and\nsubsequently with the current era of the Universe, characterised by a small\n(but dominant) cosmological-constant contribution to the cosmic energy density.\nIn this approach, the smallness of the cosmological constant today is\nattributed to the failure (due to quantum gravity non-perturbative effects) of\nthe aforementioned constraint.\n", "  We investigate the effects of nuclear mean-field as well as the formation and\ndecay of nuclear clusters on the directed flow $v_1$ in high energy\nnucleus-nucleus collisions from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ GeV to 27 GeV incident\nenergies within a transport model. Specifically, we use the JAM transport model\nin which potentials are implemented based on the framework of the relativistic\nquantum molecular dynamics. Our approach reproduces the rapidity dependence of\ndirected flow data up to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\approx 8$ GeV showing the significant\nimportance of mean-field. However, the slopes of $dv_1/dy$ at mid-rapidity are\ncalculated to be positive at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=11.7$ and 19.6 GeV, and becomes\nnegative above 27 GeV. Thus the result from the JAM hadronic transport model\nwith nuclear mean-field approach is incompatible with the data. Therefore\nwithin our approach, we conclude that the excitation function of the directed\nflow cannot be explained by the hadronic degree of freedom alone.\n", "  The plasma consisting of confining gluons resulting from the Gribov\nquantization of the SU(3) Yang-Mills theory is studied using non-equilibrium\nfluid dynamical framework. Exploiting the Bjorken symmetry and using linear\nresponse theory a general analytic expressions for the bulk and shear viscosity\ncoefficients are derived. It is found that the considered system exhibits a\nnumber of properties similar to the strongly-coupled theories, where the\nconformality is explicitly broken. In particular, it is shown that, in the\nlarge temperature limit, bulk to shear viscosity ratio, scales linearly with\nthe difference $1/3 - c_s^2$, where $c_s$ is the speed of sound. Results\nobtained from the analysis are in line with the interpretation of the\nquark-gluon plasma as an almost perfect fluid.\n", "  It is commonly believed that azimuthal anisotropies in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions are generated by hydrodynamic evolution of the strongly interacting\nquark-gluon plasma. Here we use transport models to study how azimuthal\nanisotropies depend on the number of collisions that each parton suffers. We\nfind that the majority of $v_2$ comes from the anisotropic escape of partons,\nnot from the parton collective flow, for semi-central Au+Au collisions at 200A\nGeV. As expected, the fraction of $v_2$ from the anisotropic particle escape is\neven higher for smaller systems such as d+Au. Our transport model results also\nconfirm that azimuthal anisotropies would be dominated by hydrodynamic flow at\nunrealistically-high parton cross sections. Our finding thus naturally explains\nthe similarity of azimuthal anisotropies in small and large systems; however,\nit presents a challenge to the paradigm of anisotropic flow.\n", "  We report our recent progress on the search of Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)\nby developing new measurements as well as by hydrodynamic simulations of CME\nand background effects, with both approaches addressing the pressing issue of\nseparating flow-driven background contributions and possible CME signal in\ncurrent heavy ion collision measurements.\n", "  We discuss the presence of a light dilaton in Conformal Field Theories\ndeformed by a single scalar operator, in the holographic realization consisting\nof confining Renormalization Group flows. Then, we apply this formalism to\nstudy the extension of the Standard Model with a light dilaton in a 5D warped\nmodel. We study the spectrum of scalar and vector perturbations, compare the\nmodel predictions with Electroweak Precision Tests and find the corresponding\nbounds for the lightest modes. Finally, we analyze the possibility that the\nHiggs resonance found at the LHC be a dilaton.\n", "  We extend a recently derived higher-dimensional Cardy formula to include\nangular momenta, which we use to obtain the Bekensten-Hawking entropy of AdS\nblack branes, compactified rotating branes, and large Schwarzschild/Kerr black\nholes. This is the natural generalization of Strominger's microscopic\nderivation of the BTZ black hole entropy to higher dimensions. We propose an\nextension to include $U(1)$ charge, which agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy of large Reissner-Nordstrom/Kerr-Newman black holes at high\ntemperature. We extend the results to arbitrary hyperscaling violation exponent\n(this captures the case of black D$p$-branes as a subclass) and reproduce\nlogarithmic corrections.\n", "  We apply the massive analogue of the truncated conformal space approach to\nstudy the two dimensional $\\phi^{4}$ theory in finite volume. We focus on the\nbroken phase and determine the finite size spectrum of the model numerically.\nWe interpret the results in terms of the Bethe-Yang spectrum, from which we\nextract the infinite volume masses and scattering matrices for various\ncouplings. We compare these results against semiclassical analysis and\nperturbation theory. We also analyze the critical point of the model and\nconfirm that it is in the Ising universality class.\n", "  We discuss the next-to-leading order Taylor expansion of ratios of cumulants\nof net-baryon number fluctuations. We focus on the relation between the\nskewness ratio, $S_B\\sigma_B = \\chi_3^B/\\chi_1^B$, and the kurtosis ratio,\n$\\kappa_B\\sigma_B^2 =\\chi_4^B/\\chi_2^B$. We show that differences in these two\ncumulant ratios are small for small values of the baryon chemical potential.\nThe next-to-leading order correction to $\\kappa_B\\sigma_B^2$ however is\napproximately three times larger than that for $S_B\\sigma_B$. The former thus\ndrops much more rapidly with increasing beam energy, $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We argue\nthat these generic patterns are consistent with current data on cumulants of\nnet-proton number fluctuations measured by the STAR Collaboration at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\ge 19.6$~GeV.\n", "  Event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of AA and pA collisions involve\ninitial energy densities with large spatial gradients. This is associated with\nthe presence of large Knudsen numbers ($K_n\\approx 1$) at early times, which\nmay lead one to question the validity of the hydrodynamic approach in these\nrapidly evolving, largely inhomogeneous systems. A new procedure to smooth out\nthe initial energy densities is employed to show that the initial spatial\neccentricities, $\\varepsilon_n$, are remarkably robust with respect to\nvariations in the underlying scale of initial energy density spatial gradients,\n$\\lambda$. For $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV LHC initial conditions generated by the\nMCKLN code, $\\varepsilon_n$ (across centralities) remains nearly constant if\nthe fluctuation scale varies by an order of magnitude, i.e., when $\\lambda$\nvaries from 0.1 to 1 fm. Given that the local Knudsen number $K_n\\approx\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$, the robustness of the initial eccentricities with respect\nto changes in the fluctuation scale suggests that the vn's cannot be used to\ndistinguish between events with large $K_n$ from events where $K_n$ is in the\nhydrodynamic regime. We use the 2+1 Lagrangian hydrodynamic code v-USPhydro to\nshow that this is indeed the case: anisotropic flow coefficients computed\nwithin event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics are only sensitive to long\nwavelength scales of order $\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{QCD}}\\approx 1$ fm and are\nincredibly robust with respect to variations in the initial local Knudsen\nnumber. This robustness can be used to justify the somewhat unreasonable\neffectiveness of the nearly perfect fluid paradigm in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Strong multiparticle azimuthal correlations have recently been observed in\nhigh energy proton-nucleus collisions. While final state collective effects can\nbe responsible for many of the observations, the domain structure in the\nclassical color field of a high energy nucleus also naturally leads to such\ncorrelations. We describe recent calculations of the momentum space 2-particle\ncumulant azimuthal anisotropy coefficients v_n{2}, n=2,3,4 from fundamental\nrepresentation Wilson line distributions describing the high energy nucleus. We\nfind significant differences between Wilson lines from the MV model and from\nJIMWLK evolution. We also discuss the relation of this calculation to earlier\nwork on the ridge correlation obtained in the \"glasma graph\" approximation, and\nto the \"color electric field domain model.\"\n", "  We propose a new ion-trap geometry to carry out accurate measurements of the\nquadrupole shifts in the $^{171}$Yb-ion. This trap will produce nearly ideal\nharmonic potential where the quadrupole shifts due to the anharmonic components\ncan be reduced by four orders of magnitude. This will be useful to reduce the\nuncertainties in the clock frequency measurements of the $6s~{^2}S_{1/2}\n\\rightarrow 4f^{13} 6s^2 ~{^2}F_{7/2}$ and $6s~{^2}S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 5d\n~{^2}D_{3/2}$ transitions, from which we can deduce precise values of the\nquadrupole moments ($\\Theta$s) of the $4f^{13} 6s^2 ~{^2}F_{7/2}$ and $5d\n~{^2}D_{3/2}$ states. Moreover, it may be able to affirm validity of the\nmeasured $\\Theta$ value of the $4f^{13} 6s^2 ~{^2}F_{7/2}$ state where three\nindependent theoretical studies defer almost by one order in magnitude from the\nmeasurement. We also perform calculations of $\\Theta$s using the relativistic\ncoupled-cluster (RCC) method. We use these $\\Theta$ values to estimate\nquadrupole shift that can be measured in our proposed ion trap experiment.\n", "  This proceeding briefly summarizes our recent work on calculating the\ncorrelated fluctuations of net protons on the hydrodynamic freeze-out surface\nnear the QCD critical point. For both Poisson and Binomial baselines, our\ncalculations could roughly reproduce the energy dependent cumulant $C_4$ and\n$\\kappa \\sigma^2$ of net protons, but always over-predict $C_2$ and $C_3$ due\nto the positive contributions from the static critical fluctuations.\n", "  Predictions for heavy-flavour production in relativistic heavy-ion\nexperiments provided by the POWLANG transport setup, including now also an\nin-medium hadronization model, are displayed, After showing some representative\nfindings for the Au-Au and Pb-Pb cases, a special focus will be devoted to the\nresults obtained in the small systems formed in proton(deuteron)-nucleus\ncollisions, where recent experimental data suggest the possible formation of a\nmedium featuring a collective behaviour.\n", "  Here, I review the large-scale properties of collections of active Brownian\nelongated objects, in particular rods, moving in a dissipative\nmedium/substrate. I address the problem by presenting three different models of\ndecreasing complexity, which I refer to as model I, II, and III, respectively.\n", "  We review one of the most accurate low-energy determinations of $\\alpha_s$.\nComparing at short distances the QCD static energy at three loops and\nresummation of the next-to-next-to leading logarithms with its determination in\n2+1-flavor lattice QCD, we obtain $\\alpha_s(1.5~{\\rm\nGeV})=0.336^{+0.012}_{-0.008}$, which corresponds to\n$\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1166^{+0.0012}_{-0.0008}$. We discuss future perspectives.\n", "  We explore the effects of event-by-event fluctuations of Hanbury Brown-Twiss\n(HBT) radii and show how they can be observed experimentally. The relation of\nmeasured HBT radii extracted from ensemble-averaged correlation functions to\nthe mean of their event-by-event probability distribution is clarified. We\npropose a method to experimentally determine the mean and variance of this\ndistribution and test it on an ensemble of fluctuating events generated with\nthe viscous hydrodynamic code VISH2+1. Using the same code, the sensitivity of\nthe mean and variance of the HBT radii to the specific QGP shear viscosity\n$\\eta/s$ is studied. We report sensitivity of the mean pion HBT radii and their\nvariances to the temperature dependence of $\\eta/s$ near the quark-hadron\ntransition at a level similar (10-20%) to that which was previously observed\nfor elliptic and quadrangular flow of charged hadrons [1].\n", "  We investigate the flow of a one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger model with\nperiodic boundary conditions past an obstacle, motivated by recent experiments\nwith Bose--Einstein condensates in ring traps. Above certain rotation\nvelocities, localized solutions with a nontrivial phase profile appear. In\nstriking difference from the infinite domain, in this case there are many\ncritical velocities. At each critical velocity, the steady flow solutions\ndisappear in a saddle-center bifurcation. These interconnected branches of the\nbifurcation diagram lead to additions of circulation quanta to the phase of the\nassociated solution. This, in turn, relates to the manifestation of persistent\ncurrent in numerous recent experimental and theoretical works, the connections\nto which we touch upon. The complex dynamics of the identified waveforms and\nthe instability of unstable solution branches are demonstrated.\n", "  We report on recent progress in the study of the evolution of non-Gaussian\ncumulants of critical fluctuations. We explore the implications of\nnon-equilibrium effects on the search for the QCD critical point.\n", "  Collisions of identical nuclei at finite impact parameter have an unequal\nnumber of participating nucleons from each nucleus due to fluctuations. The\nevent-by-event fluctuations have been estimated by measuring the difference of\nenergy in the zero-degree calorimeters on either side of interaction vertex.\nThe fluctuations affect the global variables such as the rapidity\ndistributions, and the effect has been correlated with a measure of these\nfluctuations.\n", "  Viscous relativistic hydrodynamics in 3+1 dimensions is applied to describe\nheavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. We present calculations of observables\nthat are sensitive to the longitudinal structure of the created system. In\nparticular we present pseudo-rapidity correlations and demonstrate their\ndependence on both the initial state and short range correlations introduced\nvia a microscopic transport description. We further demonstrate the effect of a\nvarying temperature dependence of the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio\non rapidity dependent flow harmonics.\n", "  In this paper, we provide an elementary, unified treatment of two distinct\nblue-shift instabilities for the scalar wave equation on a fixed Kerr black\nhole background: the celebrated blue-shift at the Cauchy horizon (familiar from\nthe strong cosmic censorship conjecture) and the time-reversed red-shift at the\nevent horizon (relevant in classical scattering theory).\n  Our first theorem concerns the latter and constructs solutions to the wave\nequation on Kerr spacetimes such that the radiation field along the future\nevent horizon vanishes and the radiation field along future null infinity\ndecays at an arbitrarily fast polynomial rate, yet, the local energy of the\nsolution is infinite near any point on the future event horizon. Our second\ntheorem constructs solutions to the wave equation on rotating Kerr spacetimes\nsuch that the radiation field along the past event horizon (extended into the\nblack hole) vanishes and the radiation field along past null infinity decays at\nan arbitrarily fast polynomial rate, yet, the local energy of the solution is\ninfinite near any point on the Cauchy horizon.\n  The results make essential use of the scattering theory developed in [M.\nDafermos, I. Rodnianski and Y. Shlapentokh-Rothman, A scattering theory for the\nwave equation on Kerr black hole exteriors, preprint (2014) available at\n\\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8379}] and exploit directly the time-translation\ninvariance of the scattering map and the non-triviality of the transmission\nmap.\n", "  To bracket the importance of the pre-equilibrium stage on relativistic\nheavy-ion collision observables, we compare simulations where it is modeled by\neither free-streaming partons or fluid dynamics. These cases implement the\nassumptions of extremely weak vs. extremely strong coupling in the initial\ncollision stage. Accounting for flow generated in the pre-equilibrium stage, we\nstudy the sensitivity of radial, elliptic and triangular flow on the switching\ntime when the hydrodynamic description becomes valid. Using the hybrid code\niEBE-VISHNU we perform a multi-parameter search, constrained by particle\nratios, integrated elliptic and triangular charged hadron flow, the mean\ntransverse momenta of pions, kaons and protons, and the second moment $\\langle\np_T^2\\rangle$ of the proton transverse momentum spectrum, to identify optimized\nvalues for the switching time $\\tau_s$ from pre-equilibrium to hydrodynamics,\nthe specific shear viscosity $\\eta/s$, the normalization factor of the\ntemperature-dependent specific bulk viscosity $(\\zeta/s)(T)$, and the switching\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{sw}$ from viscous hydrodynamics to the hadron cascade\nUrQMD. With the optimized parameters, we predict and compare with experiment\nthe $p_T$-distributions of $\\pi$, $K$, $p$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$ and $\\Omega$\nyields and their elliptic flow coefficients, focusing specifically on the\nmass-ordering of the elliptic flow for protons and Lambda hyperons which is\nincorrectly described by VISHNU without pre-equilibrium flow.\n", "  The (1+1)-dimensional higher-order Broer-Kaup (HBK) system is studied by\nconsistent tanh expansion (CTE) method in this paper.It is proved that the HBK\nsystem is CTE solvable. Some exact interaction solutions among different\nnonlinear excitations such as solitons, rational waves, periodic waves and\ncorresponding images are explicitly given.\n", "  There are interesting parallels between the physics of heavy ion collisions\nand cosmology. Both systems are out-of-equilibrium and relativistic fluid\ndynamics plays an important role for their theoretical description. From a\ncomparison one can draw interesting conclusions for both sides. For heavy ion\nphysics it could be rewarding to attempt a theoretical description of fluid\nperturbations similar to cosmological perturbation theory. In the context of\nlate time cosmology, it could be interesting to study dissipative properties\nsuch as shear and bulk viscosity and corresponding relaxation times in more\ndetail. Knowledge and experience from heavy ion physics could help to constrain\nthe microscopic properties of dark matter from observational knowledge of the\ncosmological fluid properties.\n", "  We delineate the properties of QCD matter at baryon density n_B=1-10n_0 (n_0:\nnuclear saturation density), through the construction of neutron star equations\nof state that satisfy the neutron star mass-radius constraints as well as\nphysical conditions on the speed of sound. The QCD matter is described in the\n3-window modeling: at n_B < 2n_0 purely nuclear matter; at n_B > 5n_0\npercolated quark matter; and at 2n_0 < n_B < 5n_0 matter intermediate between\nthese two which are constructed by interpolation. Using a schematic quark model\nwith effective interactions inspired from hadron and nuclear physics, we\nanalyze the strength of interactions necessary to describe observed neutron\nstar properties. Our finding is that the interactions should remain as strong\nas in the QCD vacuum, indicating that gluons at n_B =1-10 n_0 remain\nnon-perturbative even after quark matter formation.\n", "  We report measurements of jet quenching in $Au+Au$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV, based on the semi-inclusive distribution of\nreconstructed charged particle jets recoiling from a high $p_T$ hadron trigger.\nJets are reconstructed with the anti-k$_T$ algorithm ($R$=0.2 to 0.5), with low\nIR-cutoff of track constituents ($p_{T}>0.2$ GeV/c). Uncorrelated background is\ncorrected using a novel mixed-event technique, with no fragmentation bias\nimposed by the correction procedure on the accepted recoil jet population.\nCorrected recoil jet distributions, reported in the range $0<p_{T,jet}^{ch}<30$\nGeV/c, are used to measure jet yield suppression, jet energy loss, and\nintra-jet broadening. The first search for QCD Moli\\`ere scattering of jets in\nhot QCD matter at RHIC is reported.\n", "  We compute and compare the effects due to a uniform perpendicular magnetic\nfield as well as temperature on the static polarization functions for monolayer\ngraphene (MLG), associated with the Dirac point, with that for the\ntwo-dimensional electron liquid (2DEL) with the use of comprehensive numerical\ncalculations. Previous results for the 2DEL are discussed and, in particular,\nwe point out a flaw in a reported analytic derivation which was carried out to\nexhibit the smearing of the Fermi surface for 2DEL. The relevance of our study\nto the Kohn anomaly in low-dimensional structures and the Friedel oscillations\nfor the screening of the potential for a dilute distribution of impurities is\nreported. Our results show substantial differences due to screening for the\n2DEL and MLG which have not been given adequate attention previously.\n", "  These proceedings present directed flow ($v_1$) measurements in Au+Au\ncollisions from STAR's Beam Energy Scan (BES) program at the Relativistic\nHeavy-Ion Collider, for $p$, $\\bar{p}$, $\\Lambda$, $\\bar\\Lambda$, $K^\\pm$,\n$K^0_S$ and $\\pi^\\pm$. At intermediate centrality, protons show a minimum in\ndirected flow slope, $dv_1/dy\\,|_{y\\leq0.8}$, as a function of beam energy.\nProton $dv_1/dy$ changes sign near 10 GeV, and the directed flow for $\\Lambda$\nis consistent with the proton result. The directed flow slope for net protons\nshows a clear minimum at 14.5 GeV and becomes positive at beam energies below\n10 GeV and above 30 GeV. New results for net-kaon directed flow slope resemble\nnet protons from high energy down to 14.5 GeV, but remain negative at lower\nenergies. The slope $dv_1/dy$ shows a strong centrality dependence, especially\nfor $p$ and $\\Lambda$ at the lower beam energies. Available model calculations\nare in poor agreement.\n", "  We review recent interest in the relativistic Riemann problem as a method for\ngenerating a non-equilibrium steady state. In the version of the problem under\ncon- sideration, the initial conditions consist of a planar interface between\ntwo halves of a system held at different temperatures in a hydrodynamic regime.\nThe new double shock solutions are in contrast with older solutions that\ninvolve one shock and one rarefaction wave. We use numerical simulations to\nshow that the older solutions are preferred. Briefly we discuss the effects of\na conserved charge. Finally, we discuss deforming the relativistic equations\nwith a nonlinear term and how that deformation affects the temperature and\nvelocity in the region connecting the asymptotic fluids.\n", "  With the advent of online networks, societies are substantially more\nconnected with individual members able to easily modify and maintain their own\nsocial links. Here, we show that active network maintenance exposes agents to\nconfirmation bias, the tendency to confirm one's beliefs, and we explore how\nthis affects collective opinion formation. We introduce a model of binary\nopinion dynamics on a complex network with fast, stochastic rewiring and show\nthat confirmation bias induces a segregation of individuals with different\nopinions. We use the dynamics of global opinion to generally categorize opinion\nupdate rules and find that confirmation bias always stabilizes the consensus\nstate. Finally, we show that the time to reach consensus has a non-monotonic\ndependence on the magnitude of the bias, suggesting a novel avenue for\nlarge-scale opinion engineering.\n", "  $K2$'s Campaign 9 ($K2$C9) will conduct a $\\sim$3.7 deg$^{2}$ survey toward\nthe Galactic bulge from 7/April through 1/July of 2016 that will leverage the\nspatial separation between $K2$ and the Earth to facilitate measurement of the\nmicrolens parallax $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ for $\\gtrsim$127 microlensing events. These\nwill include several that are planetary in nature as well as many\nshort-timescale microlensing events, which are potentially indicative of\nfree-floating planets (FFPs). These satellite parallax measurements will in\nturn allow for the direct measurement of the masses of and distances to the\nlensing systems. In this white paper we provide an overview of the $K2$C9\nspace- and ground-based microlensing survey. Specifically, we detail the\ndemographic questions that can be addressed by this program, including the\nfrequency of FFPs and the Galactic distribution of exoplanets, the\nobservational parameters of $K2$C9, and the array of resources dedicated to\nconcurrent observations. Finally, we outline the avenues through which the\nlarger community can become involved, and generally encourage participation in\n$K2$C9, which constitutes an important pathfinding mission and community\nexercise in anticipation of $WFIRST$.\n", "  Two-pion interferometry measurements are studied for a broad range of\ncollision centralities in Au+Au (Root_s = 7.7 - 200 GeV) and Pb+Pb (Root_s =\n2.76 TeV) collisions. They indicate non-monotonic excitation functions for the\nGaussian emission source radii difference [(R_out)^2 - (R_side)^2], suggestive\nof reaction trajectories which spend a fair amount of time near a \"soft point\"\nin the equation of state (EOS) that coincides with the critical end point\n(CEP). A Finite-Size Scaling (FSS) analysis of these excitation functions,\nprovides further validation tests for the CEP. It also indicates a second order\nphase transition at the CEP, and the values T^{cep} ~ 165 MeV and mu_B^{cep} ~\n95 MeV for its location in the (T, mu_B)-plane of the phase diagram. The static\ncritical exponents (nu ~ 0.66 and gamma ~ 1.2) extracted via the same FSS\nanalysis, place this CEP in the 3D Ising model universality class. A Dynamic\nFinite-Size Scaling analysis of the excitation functions, gives the estimate z\n~ 0.87 for the dynamic critical exponent, suggesting that the associated\ncritical expansion dynamics is dominated by the hydrodynamic sound mode.\n", "  The indications of a possible pion condensation at the LHC are summarized.\nThe condensation is predicted by the non-equilibrium hadronization model for\n2.76 TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. The model solves the proton/pion puzzle\nand reproduces the low $p_T$ enhancement of the pion spectra, as well as the\nspectra of protons and antiprotons, charged kaons, $K^0_S$, $K^*(892)^0$ and\n$\\phi(1020)$. The obtained parameters allow to estimate the amount of pion\ncondensate on the level of 5\\% from the total number of pions at the LHC. The\ncondensate is located at $p_T<250$ MeV.\n", "  We present the first measurements of the transverse momentum spectra and\nazimuthal anisotropy of the identified hadrons ($\\pi^{+}$, $\\pi^{-}$, $K^{+}$,\n$K^{-}$, $p(\\bar{p})$, $K^{0}_{s}$, $\\Lambda(\\bar{\\Lambda})$ and $\\phi$) at\nmid-rapidity in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.5 GeV for various\ncollision centralities. These measurements are compared to corresponding\nresults from other BES energies. The bulk properties of the system, like the\nchemical and kinetic freeze-out conditions and the collectivity extracted from\nthe measured yields of the produced particles are presented. The difference\nbetween baryon and anti-baryon elliptic flow for minimum bias collisions\npreviously reported by STAR is also observed in the new data taken at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 14.5 GeV. Furthermore, the new data at 14.5 GeV are\nconsistent with the trend established by the results at lower and higher beam\nenergies. The energy and centrality dependence of the baryon chemical potential\n($\\mu_{B}$), radial flow velocity ($\\langle\\beta\\rangle$), and chemical and\nkinetic freeze-out temperatures are discussed systematically.\n", "  The RHIC Beam Energy Scan focuses on mapping the QCD phase diagram and\npinpointing the location of a possible critical end point. Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations and event-by-event fluctuations of conserved quantities, measured\nas a function of centrality and collision energy, are promising tools in these\nstudies. Recent lattice QCD and statistical thermal model calculations predict\nthat higher-order cumulants of the fluctuations are sensitive indicators of the\nphase transition. Products of these cumulants can be used to extract the\nfreeze-out parameters (1) and to locate the critical point (2). Two-pion\ninterferometry measurements are predicted to be sensitive to potential\nsoftening of the equation of state and prolonged emission duration close to the\ncritical point (3). We present recent PHENIX results on fluctuations of\nnet-charge using high-order cumulants and their products in Au+Au collisions at\n\\sqsn = 7.7 - 200 GeV, and measurement of two-pion correlation functions and\nemission-source radii in Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at several beam energies.\nThe extracted source radii are compared to previous measurements at RHIC and\nLHC in order to study energy dependence of the specific quantities sensitive to\nexpansion velocity and emission duration. Implications for the search of a\ncritical point and baryon chemical potentials at various collision energies are\ndiscussed.\n", "  History of Quark Matter '84 is presented\n", "  In this work, we propose a new class of jet substructure observables which,\nunlike fragmentation functions, are largely insensitive to the poorly known\nphysics of hadronization. We show that sub-jet structures provide us with a\nlarge discriminating power between different jet quenching Monte Carlo\nimplementations.\n", "  The production of forward $J/\\psi$ mesons in proton-nucleus collisions can\nprovide important information on gluon saturation. In a previous work we\nstudied this process in the Color Glass Condensate framework, describing the\ntarget using a dipole cross section fitted to HERA inclusive data and\nextrapolated to the case of a nuclear target using the optical Glauber model.\nIn this work we study the centrality dependence of the nuclear suppression in\nthis model and compare our results with recent LHC data for this observable.\n", "  From the analysis of the lattice data on fluctuations and correlations of\ncharm we conclude that open charm meson and baryon-like excitations exist above\nthe QCD crossover temperature, and in fact are the dominant degrees of freedom\nfor thermodynamics in the vicinity of the transition. Charm quarks become the\ndominant charm degrees of freedom only for temperatures T>200 MeV.\n", "  The Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC (STAR) experiment utilizes its excellent\nmid-rapidity tracking and particle identification capabilities to study the\nemergent properties of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The STAR heavy-ion program\nat vanishingly small baryon density is aimed to address questions about the\nquantitative properties of the strongly-interacting Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP)\nmatter created in high energy collisions ($\\eta/s$, $\\hat{q}$, chirality,\ntransport parameters, heavy quark diffusion coefficients ...). At finite baryon\ndensity, the questions concern the phases of nuclear matter (the QCD phase\ndiagram) and the nature of the phase transition, namely: what is the onset\ncollision energy for the formation of QGP? What is the nature of phase\ntransition in heavy-ion collisions? Are there two phase transition regions? If\nyes, where is the critical point situated? At Quark Matter 2015, the STAR\ncollaboration has presented a wealth of new experimental results which address\nthese questions. In these proceedings I highlight a few of those results.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$\nand elliptic flow $v_{2}$ of $D_{s}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n200 GeV with the STAR detector. These results have been compared with those of\nother open charm mesons and strange mesons to determine how the (possibly)\nstrangeness equilibrated partonic matter affects the $D_{s}$ meson production.\nWe find that the nuclear modification factor of $D_{S}$ are systematically\nhigher than unity and $D^{0}$ $R_{\\rm{AA}}$. The ratio $D_{s}/D^{0}$ is shown\nas a function of transverse momentum for the 10-40$\\%$ most central Au+Au\ncollisions and compared with that in $p+p$ collisions obtained from PYTHIA. It\nis also compared with that in Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV by the ALICE\nexperiment. Our measurement indicates a hint of enhancement of $D_{S}$\nproduction in Au+Au collisions with respect to $p+p$ collisions as compared to\nnon-strange $D$ mesons.\n", "  We present the complete physical picture for the evolution of a high-energy\njet propagating through a weakly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) by analytical\nand numerical investigation of thermalization of the soft components of the\njet. Our results support the following physical picture: the leading particle\nemits a significant number of mini-jets which promptly evolve via multiple\nbranching and thus degrade into a myriad of soft gluons, with energies of the\norder of the medium temperature $T$. Via elastic collisions with the medium\nconstituents, these soft gluons relax to local thermal equilibrium with the\nplasma over a time scale which is considerably shorter than the typical\nlifetime of the mini-jet. The thermalized gluons form a tail which lags behind\nthe hard components of the jet. Together with the background QGP, they behave\nhydrodynamically.\n", "  In the framework of soft-collinear effective theory with Glauber gluons,\nresults and predictions for inclusive hadron suppression, based upon in-medium\nparton shower evolution, are presented for Au+Au and Pb+Pb collisions at RHIC\nand LHC energies $\\sqrt{s}=200$ AGeV and $\\sqrt{s}=2.76, \\, 5.1$ ATeV,\nrespectively. The $\\rm SCET_G$ medium-induced splitting kernels are further\nimplemented to evaluate the attenuation of reconstructed jet cross in such\nreactions and to examine their centrality and radius $R$ dependence. Building\nupon a previously developed method to systematically resum the jet shape at\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, a quantitative understanding of the jet\nshape modification measurement in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ ATeV at\nthe LHC can be achieved. Predictions for photon-tagged jet cross sections and\nshapes, that can shed light on the parton flavor dependence of in-medium parton\nshower modification, are also given.\n", "  The hadronic matter described as a skyrmion matter embedded in an FCC crystal\nis found to turn into a half-skyrmion matter with vanishing (in the chiral\nlimit) quark condensate and {\\it non-vanishing} pion decay constant {$f_\\pi$}\nat a density $n_{1/2}$ lower than or near the critical density $n_c$ at which\nhadronic matter changes over to a chiral symmetry restored phase with possibly\ndeconfined quarks. When hidden local gauge fields and a dilaton scalar of\nspontaneously broken scale symmetry with decay constant $f_\\chi$ are\nincorporated, this half-skyrmion phase is characterized by $f_\\chi\\approx\nf_\\pi\\neq 0$ with the hidden gauge coupling $g\\neq 0$ but $\\ll 1$. While chiral\nsymmetry is restored {\\it globally} in this region in the sense that\nspace-averaged, $\\la\\bar{q}q\\ra$ vanishes, quarks are still confined in massive\nhadrons and massless pions. This phase is shown to play a crucial role in the\nmodel for a smooth transition from a soft EoS at low density to a stiffer EoS\nat high density, the changeover taking place at $n_{1/2} \\sim 2n_0$. It\nresembles the \"quarkyonic phase\" predicted in large $N_c$ QCD and represents\nthe \"hadronic freedom\" regime which figures as a doorway to chiral restoration.\nThe fractionization of skyrmion matter into half-skyrmion matter has a\ntantalizing analogy to what appears to happen in condensed matter in (2+1)\ndimensions where half-skyrmions or \"merons\" enter as relevant degrees of\nfreedom at the interface.\n", "  The strong interaction between heavy quarks and the quark gluon plasma makes\nthe open and hidden charm hadrons be sensitive probes of the deconfinement\nphase transition in high energy nuclear collisions. Both the cold and hot\nnuclear matter effects change with the colliding energy and significantly\ninfluence the heavy quark and charmonium yield and their transverse momentum\ndistributions. The ratio of averaged quarkonium transverse momentum square and\nthe elliptic flow reveal the nature of the QCD medium created in heavy ion\ncollisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC energies.\n", "  Using kinetic theory, we analyze the interplay of elastic and inelastic\ncollisions in the thermalization of the quark-gluon plasma. The main focus is\nthe dynamics and equilibration of long wavelength modes.\n", "  The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a remarkable phenomenon that stems from\nhighly nontrivial interplay of QCD chiral symmetry, axial anomaly, and gluonic\ntopology. It is of fundamental importance to search for the CME in experiments.\nThe heavy ion collisions provide a unique environment where a hot\nchiral-symmetric quark-gluon plasma is created, gluonic topological\nfluctuations generate chirality imbalance, and very strong magnetic fields\n$|\\vec{\\bf B}|\\sim m_\\pi^2$ are present during the early stage of such\ncollisions. Significant efforts have been made to look for CME signals in heavy\nion collision experiments. In this contribution we give a brief overview on the\nstatus of such efforts.\n", "  We calculate the QCD cross-over temperature, the equation of state and\nfluctuations of conserved charges at finite density by analytical continuation\nfrom imaginary to real chemical potentials. Our calculations are based on new\ncontinuum extrapolated lattice simulations using the 4stout staggered actions\nwith a lattice resolution up to $N_t=16$. The simulation parameters are tuned\nsuch that the strangeness neutrality is maintained, as it is in heavy ion\ncollisions.\n", "  Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that all accessible\nconfigurations of a system are equally likely. This requires dynamics that\nexplore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum\nsystems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an\noutstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum\nsystem consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a\nsequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the\ndensity matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can\nact like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through\nentanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase\nspace dynamics in the classical limit; classically chaotic motion coincides\nwith higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high\nentropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work\nillustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental\nquestions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n", "  We report a systematic strengthening of the local solar surface or\nfundamental $f$-mode $1$-$2$ days prior to the emergence of an active region\n(AR) in the same (corotating) location. Except for a possibly related increase\nin the kurtosis of the magnetic field, no indication can be seen in the\nmagnetograms at that time. Our study is motivated by earlier numerical findings\nof Singh et al. (2014) which showed that, in the presence of a nonuniform\nmagnetic field that is concentrated a few scale heights below the surface, the\n$f$-mode fans out in the diagnostic $k\\omega$ diagram at high wavenumbers. Here\nwe explore this possibility using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and show for six isolated ARs,\n11130, 11158, 11242, 11105, 11072, and 11768, that at large latitudinal\nwavenumbers (corresponding to horizontal scales of around 3000 km), the\n$f$-mode displays strengthening about two days prior to AR formation and thus\nprovides a new precursor for AR formation. Furthermore, we study two ARs, 12051\nand 11678, apart from a magnetically quiet patch lying next to AR~12529, to\ndemonstrate the challenges in extracting such a precursor signal when a newly\nforming AR emerges in a patch that lies in close proximity of one or several\nalready existing ARs which are expected to pollute neighboring patches. We then\ndiscuss plausible procedures for extracting precursor signals from regions with\ncrowded environments. The idea that the $f$-mode is perturbed days before any\nvisible magnetic activity occurs at the surface can be important in\nconstraining dynamo models aimed at understanding the global magnetic activity\nof the Sun.\n", "  Heavy-flavor quarks are dominantly produced in initial hard scattering\nprocesses and experience the whole evolution of the system in heavy-ion\ncollisions at RHIC energies. Thus they are suggested to be an excellent probe\nto the medium properties through their interaction with the medium. In this\nproceedings, we report our first measurement of $D^0$ production via\ntopological reconstruction using STAR's recently installed Heavy Flavor Tracker\n(HFT). We also report our new measurement of Nuclear Modification Factor\n($R_{AA}$) of $D^0$ mesons in central Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200\nGeV as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{T}$). New results confirm the\nstrong suppression at high $p_{T}$ with a much improved precision, and show\nthat the $R_{AA}$ at high $p_{T}$ are comparable with light hadrons ($\\pi$) and\nwith D meson measurements at the LHC. Furthermore, several theoretical\ncalculations are compared to our data, and with charm diffusion coefficient\n2${\\pi}TD_{S}$ $\\sim$ 2-12 can reproduce both the $D^0$ $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ data\nin Au+Au collisions at RHIC.\n", "  Heavy quarks are produced through initial hard scatterings and they are\naffected by the hot and dense medium created in heavy-ion collisions throughout\nits whole evolution. Due to their heavy mass, charm quarks are expected to\nthermalize much more slowly than light flavor quarks. The charm quark flow is a\nunique tool to study the extent of thermalization of the bulk medium dominated\nby light quarks and gluons. At high $p_T$, D meson azimuthal anisotropy is\nsensitive to the path length dependence of charm quark energy loss in the\nmedium, which offers new insights into heavy quark energy loss mechanisms -\ngluon radiation vs. collisional processes. We present the STAR measurement of\nelliptic flow ($v_2$) of $D^0$ and $D^{\\pm}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV, for a wide transverse momentum range. These results\nare obtained from the data taken in the first year of physics running of the\nnew STAR Heavy Flavor Tracker detector, which greatly improves open heavy\nflavor hadron measurements by the topological reconstruction of secondary decay\nvertices. The D meson $v_2$ is finite for $p_T > 2 \\text{ GeV/c}^2$ and\nsystematically below the measurement of light particle species at the same\nenergy. Comparison to a series of model calculations favors scenarios where\ncharm flows with the medium and is used to infer a range for the charm\ndiffusion coefficient $2\\pi T D_s$.\n", "  We report on our recent attempt of quantitative modeling of the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) in heavy-ion collisions. We perform 3+1 dimensional\nanomalous hydrodynamic simulations on an event-by-event basis, with\nconstitutive equations that contain the anomaly-induced effects. We also\ndevelop a model of the initial condition for the axial charge density that\ncaptures the statistical nature of random chirality imbalances created by the\ncolor flux tubes. Basing on the event-by-event hydrodynamic simulations for\nhundreds of thousands of collisions, we calculate the correlation functions\nthat are measured in experiments, and discuss how the anomalous transport\naffects these observables.\n", "  Transverse energy distributions at midrapidity have been measured by the\nPHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for Au+Au,\nU+U, Cu+Au, Cu+Cu, He+Au, d+Au, and p+p collisions over a wide energy range\nfrom $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 GeV to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV as a function of\ncentrality. For central Au+Au collisions, it is observed that the midrapidity\nBjorken energy density demonstrates a power law behavior from $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n7.7 GeV to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV. At a given collision energy, the data\npresented as a function of $N_{part}$ are independent of the size of the\ncollision system. For Au+Au, Cu+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions, the\ncentrality-dependent data are better described by scaling with the number of\nconstituent quark participants than scaling with the number of nucleon\nparticipants.\n", "  Studying fluctuations of conserved quantities, such as baryon number,\nstrangeness, and charge, provides insights into the properties of matter\ncreated in high-energy nuclear collisions. Lattice QCD calculations suggest\nthat higher moments of these quantities are sensitive to the phase structure of\nthe hot and dense nuclear matter created in such collisions. In this paper, we\npresent first experimental results of volume and temperature independent\ncumulant ratios of net-charge and net-proton distributions in Au+Au collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\\!=\\!14.5 \\,{\\rm GeV}$ completing the first RHIC Beam\nEnergy Scan (BES-I) program for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\\!=\\!7.7 \\,{\\rm\nto}\\,200\\,{\\rm GeV}$, together with the first measurement of fully corrected\nnet-kaon results, measured with the STAR detector at RHIC at mid-rapidity and a\ntransverse momentum up to $p_{\\rm T}\\!=\\!2\\,{\\rm GeV/{\\it c}}$. The\npseudo-rapidity dependence of the $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\\!=\\!14.5 \\,{\\rm GeV}$\nnet-charge cumulant ratios is discussed. The estimated uncertainties on the\nratio $c_4/c_2$, the most statistics-hungry of the present observables, at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}\\!=\\!7.7 \\,{\\rm GeV}$ in the upcoming RHIC BES-II program\nwill also be presented.\n", "  The direct photodissociation of trapped $^{85}$Rb$_2^+$ (rubidium) molecular\nions by the cooling light for the $^{85}$Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) is\nstudied, both experimentally and theoretically. Vibrationally excited\nRb$_{2}^{+}$ ions are created by photoionization of Rb$_{2}$ molecules formed\nphotoassociatively in the Rb MOT and are trapped in a modified spherical Paul\ntrap. The decay rate of the trapped Rb$_{2}^{+}$ ion signal in the presence of\nthe MOT cooling light is measured and agreement with our calculated rates for\nmolecular ion photodissociation is observed. The photodissociation mechanism\ndue to the MOT light is expected to be active and therefore universal for all\nhomonuclear diatomic alkali metal molecular ions.\n", "  We discuss the importance of initial state and early time effects with regard\nto the theoretical understanding of long range azimuthal correlations observed\nin high-multiplicity $p+p$ and $p+A$ collisions.\n", "  This article reviews a method for calculating an equilibrium interfacial\nphase diagram depicting regions of stability for different interface structures\nas function of temperature and chemical potentials. Density functional theory\n(DFT) is used for interfacial energies, Monte Carlo simulations together with\ncluster expansions based on DFT results for obtaining configurational free\nenergies, and CALPHAD-type modeling for describing the thermodynamic properties\nof the adjoining bulk phases. An explicit case, vanadium doped cemented\ncarbides, is chosen to illustrate the progress in the research field and the\ninterfacial diagram, a complexion diagram, for the phase boundary WC(0001)/Co\nis constructed as function of temperature and chemical potentials.\n", "  At top RHIC and LHC energies the suppression of high transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) hadrons provides evidence for partonic energy loss in QGP.\nWe study partonic energy loss in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) by\ninvestigating the centrality dependence of the binary-collision-scaled\nhigh-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ yields. Observing a decrease of the scaled yield in more\ncentral collisions is proposed as a possible signature for jet quenching. Even\nat energies and centralities where this signature is lost a QGP may still be\nformed since competing phenomena responsible for enhancements may overwhelm the\nsuppression from energy loss. Measurements in several ranges of\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ from $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27,\n39, 62.4, and 200 GeV data show that relative hadron suppression persists at\nleast down to 14.5 GeV.\n  To further investigate both the possible formation of a QGP at these lower\nenergies and whether the observed hadron suppression coincides with the onset\nof other QGP signatures, we examine the energy and centrality dependence of\n$v_{3}$. Models have shown that the development of $v_{3}$ requires the\npresence of a low viscosity phase early in the collision. We find that for\ncollisions with $N_{\\mathrm{part}}$<50, $v_{3}$ disappears for energies below\n14.5 GeV, suggestive of a turn-off of the QGP. But for $N_{\\mathrm{part}}$>50,\n$v_{3}$ persists down to the lowest energies. Together, these signatures\nprovide possible evidence for the formation of a QGP in the lowest energy\ncollisions at RHIC.\n", "  We study the one loop renormalization group flow of the marginal deformations\nof N=4 SYM theory using the a-function. We found that in the planar limit some\nnon-supersymmetric deformations flow to the supersymmetric infrared fixed\npoints described by the Leigh-Strassler theory. This means supersymmetry\nemerges as a result of renormalization group flow.\n", "  Quantum field theories of strongly interacting matter sometimes have a useful\nholographic description in terms of the variables of a gravitational theory in\nhigher dimensions. This duality maps time dependent physics in the gauge theory\nto time dependent solutions of the Einstein equations in the gravity theory. In\norder to better understand the process by which \"real world\" theories such as\nQCD behave out of thermodynamic equilibrium, we study time dependent\nperturbations to states in a model of a confining, strongly coupled gauge\ntheory via holography. Operationally, this involves solving a set of non-linear\nEinstein equations supplemented with specific time dependent boundary\nconditions. The resulting solutions allow one to comment on the timescale by\nwhich the perturbed states thermalize, as well as to quantify the properties of\nthe final state as a function of the perturbation parameters. We comment on the\ninfluence of the dual gauge theory's confinement scale on these results, as\nwell as the appearance of a previously anticipated universal scaling regime in\nthe \"abrupt quench\" limit.\n", "  Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a prototypical ferroelectric perovskite that\nundergoes the rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal-cubic phase transitions as\nthe temperature increases. In this work, we develop a classical interatomic\npotential for BaTiO$_3$ within the framework of the bond-valence theory. The\nforce field is parameterized from first-principles results, enabling accurate\nlarge-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at finite temperatures. Our\nmodel potential for BaTiO$_3$ reproduces the temperature-driven phase\ntransitions in isobaric-isothermal ensemble (NPT) MD simulations. This\npotential allows the analysis of BaTiO$_3$ structures with atomic resolution.\nBy analyzing the local displacements of Ti atoms, we demonstrate that the phase\ntransitions of BaTiO$_3$ exhibit a mix of order-disorder and displacive\ncharacters. Besides, from detailed observation of structural dynamics during\nphase transition, we discover that the global phase transition is associated\nwith changes in the equilibrium value and fluctuations of each polarization\ncomponent, including the ones already averaging to zero, Contrary to the\nconventional understanding that temperature increase generally causes\nbond-softening transition, the x polarization component exhibits a\nbond-hardening character during the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition.\nThese results provide further insights about the temperature-driven phase\ntransitions in BaTiO$_3$.\n", "  In the exotic atoms where one atomic $1s$ electron is replaced by a $K^{-}$,\nthe strong interaction between the $K^{-}$ and the nucleus introduces an energy\nshift and broadening of the low-lying kaonic atomic levels which are determined\nby only the electromagnetic interaction. By performing X-ray spectroscopy for\nZ=1,2 kaonic atoms, the SIDDHARTA experiment determined with high precision the\nshift and width for the $1s$ state of $K^{-}p$ and the $2p$ state of kaonic\nhelium-3 and kaonic helium-4. These results provided unique information of the\nkaon-nucleus interaction in the low energy limit.\n", "  We develop a new integrated dynamical model to investigate the effects of the\nhydrodynamic fluctuations on observables in high-energy nuclear collisions. We\nimplement hydrodynamic fluctuations in a fully 3-D dynamical model consisting\nof the hydrodynamic initialization models of the Monte-Carlo\nKharzeev-Levin-Nardi model, causal dissipative hydrodynamics and the subsequent\nhadronic cascades. By analyzing the hadron distributions obtained by massive\nevent-by-event simulations with both of hydrodynamic fluctuations and\ninitial-state fluctuations, we discuss the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations\non the flow harmonics, $v_n$ and their fluctuations.\n", "  We present an overview of the most recent results on bulk and transport\nproperties of QCD matter inferred from lattice QCD simulations.\n", "  Transport properties of a single plasmon interacting with a hybrid system\ncomposed of a semiconductor quantum dot (SQD) and a metal nanoparticle (MNP)\ncoupled to one-dimensional surface plasmonic waveguide are investigated\ntheoretically via the real-space approach. We considered that the MNP-SQD\ninteraction leads to the formation of a hybrid exciton and the transmission and\nreflection of a single incident plasmon could be controlled by adjusting the\nfrequency of the classical control field applied to the MNP-SQD hybrid\nnanosystem, the kinds of metallic nanoparticles and the background media,\nrespectively. The transport properties of a single plasmon interacting with\nsuch a hybrid nanosystem discussed here could find the applications in the\ndesign of next-generation quantum devices such as single photon switching and\nnanomirrors, and in quantum information processing.\n", "  The Future Circular Collider is a new proposed collider at CERN with\ncentre-of-mass energies around 100 TeV in the pp mode. Ongoing studies aim at\nassessing its physics potential and technical feasibility. Here we focus on\nupdates in physics opportunities accessible in pA and AA collisions not covered\nin previous Quark Matter contributions, including Quark-Gluon Plasma and gluon\nsaturation studies, novel hard probes of QCD matter, and photon-induced\ncollisions.\n", "  We test a free {\\it ad hoc} parametrization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\n(TOV) equation. We do not have in mind any specific extended theory of gravity\n(ETG) but each new parameter introduced has a physical interpretation. Our aim\nis fully pedagogical rather than a proposal for a new ETG. Given a realistic\nneutron star equation of state we map the contributions of each new parameter\ninto a shift in trajectories of the mass-radius diagram. This exercise allows\nus to make the correspondence between each TOV sector with possible\nmodifications of gravity and clarifies how neutron star observations are\nhelpful for distinguishing theories.\n", "  I discuss how local thermal equilibrium and hydrodynamical flow are reached\nin heavy-ion collisions in the weak coupling limit.\n", "  The decay of $B^*_{s,d} \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$~ and its impact on $B_{s,d} \\to\n\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ is studied here. The $ \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay widths of vector mesons\n$B^*_{s,d}$ are about a factor of 700 larger than the corresponding scalar\nmesons $B_{s,d}$. The obtained ratio of the branching fractions\n$Br({B_{s,d}^*\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-})/{Br({B_{s,d}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-})}$ is about\n$\\frac{0.3 \\times {\\rm eV}}{{\\Gamma(B^*_{s,d} \\to B_{s,d} \\gamma)}}$. At the\nsame time, the hadronic contribution $B_{s,d} \\to B^*_{s,d} \\gamma \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$ is estimated too. The relative increase of the amplitude of $B_{s,d}\\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is about $(0.01\\pm 0.006) \\sqrt{\\frac{{\\Gamma(B^*_{s,d} \\to B_{s,d}\n\\gamma)}}{{100~ {\\rm eV}}}}$. If we choose $\\Gamma(B^*_{s,d} \\to B_{s,d}\n\\gamma)=2~$eV, the branching fractions of the vector mesons to lepton pair are\n$(6.2 \\pm 0.6) \\times 10^{-10}$ and $(1.7 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-11}$ for\n$B^*_{s}$ and $B^*_{d}$ respectively. If we choose $\\Gamma(B^*_{s,d} \\to\nB_{s,d} \\gamma)=200~$eV, the updated branching fractions of the scalar mesons\nto muon pair are $(3.78 \\pm 0.25)\\times 10^{-9}$ and $(1.09 \\pm 0.09)\\times\n10^{-10}$ for $B_{s}$ and $B_{d}$ respectively. Further studies on $B^*_{s,d}$\nare usefully here, including dielectron decay, two-body decay with $J/\\psi$,\nand so on.\n", "  We present a broad conceptual introduction to some new ideas in\nnon-perturbative QFT. The large-$N$ orbifold-orientifold equivalence connects a\nnatural large-$N$ limit of QCD to QCD with adjoint fermions. QCD(adj) with\nperiodic boundary conditions and double-trace deformation of Yang-Mills theory\nsatisfy large-$N$ volume independence, a type of orbifold equivalence. Certain\nQFTs that satisfy volume independence at $N=\\infty$ exhibit adiabatic\ncontinuity at finite-$N$, and also become semi-classically calculable on small\n$\\mathbb R^3 \\times S^1$. We discuss the role of monopole-instantons, and\nmagnetic and neutral bion saddles in connection to mass gap, and center and\nchiral symmetry realizations. Neutral bions also provide a weak coupling\nsemiclassical realization of infrared-renormalons. These considerations help\nmotivate the necessity of complexification of path integrals (Picard-Lefschetz\ntheory) in semi-classical analysis, and highlights the importance of hidden\ntopological angles. Finally, we briefly review the resurgence program, which\npotentially provides a novel non-perturbative continuum definition of QFT. All\nthese ideas are continuously connected.\n", "  Heavy quarks, i.e. charm and beauty, are sensitive probes of the medium\nproduced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. They are produced in the early\nstage of the collisions and are expected to experience the whole collision\nevolution interacting with the medium constituents via both elastic and\ninelastic processes. The nuclear modification factor ($R_{\\rm AA}$) and the\nelliptic flow ($v_{2}$) are two of the main experimental observables that allow\nus to investigate the interaction strength of heavy quarks with the medium. The\nALICE collaboration measured the production and elliptic flow of open\nheavy-flavour hadrons via their hadronic and semi-leptonic decays to electrons\nat mid-rapidity and to muons at forward rapidity in Pb--Pb collisions. Recent\nresults will be discussed, and model calculations including the interaction of\nheavy quarks with the hot, dense, and deconfined medium will be confronted with\nthe data.\n", "  Cooling and trapping of atoms by light has enabled one to build and\nmanipulate quantum systems at the single atom level. Such a bottom-up approach\nbecomes one of the fascinating challenges toward scalable and highly\ncontrollable quantum systems, e.g., a large-scale quantum information machine.\nTheir implementation requires crucial pre-requisites: scalablity, site\ndistinguishability, and reliable single-atom loading into sites. The widely\nadopted methods satisfies the two former conditions relatively well, but the\nlast condition, filling single atoms onto individual sites, relies mostly on\nthe probabilistic loading, implying that loading a pre-defined set of atoms in\ngiven positions will be hampered exponentially. Two approaches are readily\nthinkable to overcome this issue: increasing the single-atom loading efficiency\nand relocating abundant atoms into unfilled positions. Realizing the relocation\nis directly related to how many atoms can be transportable in a designer way.\nHere, we demonstrate a dynamic holographic single-atom tweezers with\nunprecedented degrees of freedom of 2N. In a proof-of-principle experiment\nconducted with cold rubidium atoms, simultaneous rearrangements of N=9 single\natoms are successfully performed. This method may be further applicable to\ndeterministic N single-atom loading, coherent transport, and controlled\ncollisions.\n", "  I summarize our recent work towards finding and utilizing analytic solutions\nof relativistic hydrodynamic. In the first part I discuss various exact\nsolutions of the second-order conformal hydrodynamics. In the second part I\ncompute flow harmonics $v_n$ analytically using the anisotropically deformed\nGubser flow and discuss its dependence on $n$, $p_T$, viscosity, the chemical\npotential and the charge.\n", "  We give sufficient conditions for the number rigidity of a translation\ninvariant or periodic point process on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=1,2$. That is,\nthe probability distribution of the number of particles in a bounded domain\n$\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, conditional on the configuration on\n$\\Lambda^\\complement$, is concentrated on a single integer $N_\\Lambda$. These\nconditions are : (a) the variance of the number of particles in a bounded\ndomain $\\mathcal{O} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ grows slower than the volume of\n$\\mathcal{O}$ (a.k.a. superhomogeneous point processes), when $\\mathcal{O}\n\\uparrow \\mathbb{R}^d$ (in a self-similar manner), and (b) the truncated pair\ncorrelation function is bounded by $C_1[|x-y|+1]^{-2}$ in $d=1$ and by\n$C_2[|x-y|+1]^{-(4+\\epsilon)}$ in $d=2$. These conditions are satisfied by all\nknown processes with number rigidity ([GP],[G],[PS],[AM],[Bu],[BuDQ], [BBNY],\nand many more) in $d=1,2$. We also observe, in the light of the results of\n[PS], that no such criteria exist in $d>2$.\n", "  The dynamical structure of topologically massive gravity in the context of\nthe Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic approach is studied. It is shown that this method\nallows to avoid some ambiguities arising in the study of the gauge structure\nvia the Dirac formalism. In particular, the complete set of constraints and the\ngauge symmetry generators of the theory are obtained straightforwardly via the\nzero-modes of the symplectic matrix. In order to obtain the generalized\nFaddeev-Jackiw brackets and calculate the local physical degrees of freedom of\nthis model, an appropriate gauge-fixing procedure is introduced. Finally, the\nsimilarities and advantages between Faddeev-Jackiw method and Dirac's formalism\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  Aiming to understand the phase structure of lattice QCD at nonzero\ntemperature and density, we study the phase transitions of QCD in an extended\nparameter space, where the number of flavor and quark masses are considered as\nparameters. Performing simulations of 2 flavor QCD and using the reweighting\nmethod, we investigate (2+Nf) flavor QCD at finite density, where two light\nflavors and Nf massive flavors exist. Calculating probability distribution\nfunctions, we determine the critical surface terminating first order phase\ntransitions in the parameter space of the light quark mass, the heavy quark\nmass and the chemical potential. Through the study of the many flavor system,\nwe discuss the phase structure of QCD at finite density.\n", "  We extend the results of arXiv:1401.7016, computing one loop partition\nfunctions for massive fields with spin half in AdS_2 using the quasinormal mode\nmethod proposed by Denef, Hartnoll, and Sachdev in arXiv:0908.2657. We find the\nfinite representations of SO(2,1) for spin zero and spin half, consisting of a\nhighest weight state |h\\rangle and descendants with non-unitary values of h.\nThese finite representations capture the poles and zeroes of the one loop\ndeterminants. Together with the asymptotic behavior of the partition functions\n(which can be easily computed using a large mass heat kernel expansion), these\nare sufficient to determine the full answer for the one loop determinants. We\nalso discuss extensions to higher dimensional AdS_{2n} and higher spins.\n", "  The COMPASS experiment at the CERN-SPS studies the spectrum and the structure\nof hadrons by scattering high energy hadrons and polarised muons off various\nfixed targets. Recent results for the hadron programme comprise highlights from\ndifferent topics. A selective overview is given and, among others, the\nfollowing results are discussed. The precise determination of the pion\npolarisability, a long standing puzzle that has been solved now, is presented\nas well as measurements of radiative widths. The observation of a new narrow\naxial-vector state, the $a_1(1420)$, as well as deeper insights into the exotic\n$1^{-+}$-wave, which is under study since decades by several experiments, are\ndiscussed and further, the search for the charmonium-like exotic $Z_c(3900)$\nstate in the COMPASS data is covered.\n", "  Matrix integrals used in random matrix theory for the study of eigenvalues of\nHermitian ensembles have been shown to provide $\\tau$-functions for several\nhierarchies of integrable equations. In this article, we extend this relation\nby showing that such integrals can also provide $\\tau$-functions for the\ndiscrete KP hierarchy and a coupled version of the same hierarchy obtained\nthrough the process of Pfaffianization. To do so, we consider the first\nequation of the discrete KP hierarchy, the Hirota-Miwa equation. We write the\nWronskian determinant solutions to the Hirota-Miwa equation and consider a\nparticular form of matrix integrals, which we show is an example of those\nWronskian solutions. The argument is then generalized to the whole hierarchy. A\nsimilar strategy is used for the Pfaffianized version of the hierarchy except\nthat in that case, the solutions are written in terms of Pfaffians rather than\ndeterminants.\n", "  A new model CRAC:EPII (Cosmic Ray Atmospheric Cascade: Electron Precipitation\nInduced Ionization) is presented. The CRAC:EPII is based on Monte Carlo\nsimulation of precipitating electrons propagation and interaction with matter\nin the Earth atmosphere. It explicitly considers energy deposit: ionization,\npair production, Compton scattering, generation of Bremsstrahlung high energy\nphotons, photo-ionization and annihilation of positrons, multiple scattering as\nphysical processes accordingly. The propagation of precipitating electrons and\ntheir interactions with atmospheric molecules is carried out with the GEANT4\nsimulation tool PLANETOCOSMICS code using NRLMSISE 00 atmospheric model. The\nionization yields is compared with an analytical parametrization for various\nenergies of incident precipitating electron, using a flux of mono-energetic\nparticles. A good agreement between the two models is achieved. Subsequently,\non the basis of balloon-born measured spectra of precipitating electrons at\n30.10.2002 and 07.01.2004, the ion production rate in the middle and upper\natmosphere is estimated using the CRAC:EPII model\n", "  The high-energy evolution in perturbative QCD suffers from a severe\nlack-of-convergence problem, due to higher order corrections enhanced by double\nand single transverse logarithms. We resum double logarithms to all orders\nwithin the non-linear Balitsky-Kovchegov equation, by taking into account\nsuccessive soft gluon emissions strongly ordered in lifetime. We further resum\nsingle logarithms generated by the first non-singular part of the splitting\nfunctions and by the one-loop running of the coupling. The resummed BK equation\nadmits stable solutions, which are used to successfully fit the HERA data at\nsmall $x$ for physically acceptable initial conditions and reasonable values of\nthe fit parameters.\n", "  In the paper by Khomenko et al. [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{91}, 180504 (2015)] the\nauthors, analyzing numerically the steady counterflowing helium in\ninhomogeneous channel flow, concluded that the production term $\\mathcal{P}$ in\nthe Vinen equation is proportional to $\\left\\vert \\mathbf{V}_{ns}\\right\\vert\n^{3}\\mathcal{L}^{1/2}$ (where $\\mathcal{L}$ is vortex line density and\n$\\mathbf{V}_{ns}$ is the counterflow velocity). In present comment we\ndemonstrated that the procedure, implemented by the authors includes a number\nof questionable steps, such as a decomposition of velocity of line and\ninterpretation of the flux term. Additionally, the overall strategy -\nextracting information on the temporal behavior from the stationary solution\nalso remains questionable. Because of that the method of determination of the\nexplicit shape of Vinen equation is very sensitive to the listed elements, the\nfinal conclusion of the authors cannot be considered as unambiguous.\n", "  The Na+ current in nerve and muscle membranes may be described in terms of\nthe activation variable m(t) and the inactivation variable h(t), which are\ndependent on the transitions of S4 sensors of each of the Na+ channel domains\nDI to DIV. The time-dependence of the Na+ current and the rate equations\nsatisfied by m(t) and h(t) may be derived from the solution to a master\nequation which describes the coupling between two or three activation sensors\nregulating the Na+ channel conductance and a two stage inactivation process. If\nthe inactivation rate from the closed or open states increases as the S4\nsensors activate, a more general form for the Hodgkin-Huxley expression for the\nopen state probability may be derived where m(t) is dependent on both\nactivation and inactivation processes. The voltage dependence of the rate\nfunctions for inactivation and recovery from inactivation are consistent with\nthe empirically determined expressions, and exhibit saturation for both\ndepolarized and hyperpolarized clamp potentials.\n", "  The direct detection of dark matter constituents, in particular the weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs), is considered central to particle\nphysics and cosmology. In this paper we study transitions to the excited\nstates, possible in some nuclei, which have sufficiently low lying excited\nstates. Examples considered previously were the first excited states of\n$^{127}$I and $^{129}$Xe and $^{83}$Kr. Here we examine $^{125}$Te, which\noffers some advantages and is currently being considered as a target.In all\nthese cases the extra signature of the gamma rays following the de-excitation\nof these states has definite advantages over the purely nuclear recoil and, in\nprinciple, such a signature can be exploited experimentally. A brief discussion\nof the experimental feasibility is given in the context of the CUORE\nexperiment.\n", "  The search for the critical point of QCD in heavy-ion collision experiments\nhas sparked enormous interest with the completion of phase I of the RHIC beam\nenergy scan. Here, I review the basics of the thermodynamics of the QCD phase\ntransition and its implications for experimental multiplicity fluctuations in\nheavy-ion collisions. Several sources of noncritical fluctuations impact the\nobservables and need to be understood in addition to the critical phenomena.\nRecent progress has been made in dynamical modeling of critical fluctuations,\nwhich ultimately is indispensable to understand potential signals of the QCD\ncritical point in heavy-ion collision.\n", "  We here show that at lower momentum (i.e., $p_\\perp \\sim 10$GeV) single\nparticle suppression for different types of probes exhibit a clear mass\nhierarchy, which is a direct consequence of the differences in the energy loss,\nrather than the differences in the initial distributions. On the other hand, we\npredict that the mass hierarchy is not expected at high momentum (i.e.,\n$p_\\perp \\sim 100$GeV); i.e., while we surprisingly predict that suppression\nfor charged hadrons will be somewhat smaller than the suppression for heavy\nmesons, we find that this difference will be a consequence of fragmentation\nfunctions, not the finite mass effects. That is, apart from the fragmentation\nfunctions, the probes of different masses exhibit nearly the same suppression\nin the high momentum region. We also argue that the same insensitivity on the\nprobe types also appears for jets. In particular, the experimental data in the\nmomentum regions where they exist for both types of probes, show similar\nsuppressions of charged hadrons and inclusive jet data. Interestingly, we also\nfind that our state-of-the-art suppression predictions for high momentum single\nparticles are also in agreement with the jet suppression data, where the\nreasons behind this agreement yet remain to be understood. Finally, the\navailable jet data also show (though with large error bars) an overlap between\nb jets (heavy) and inclusive jets (light) probes. Consequently, our results\nsuggest that single particles in the momentum region below 50 GeV present an\nexcellent tool for mass tomography, while high momentum single particles and\n(possibly) jets are somewhat insensitive to the details of the interaction with\nquark-gluon plasma.\n", "  I explain how to evolve segmented strings in de Sitter and anti-de Sitter\nspaces of any dimension in terms of forward-directed null displacements. The\nevolution is described entirely in terms of discrete hops which do not require\na continuum spacetime. Moreover, the evolution rule is purely algebraic, so it\ncan be defined not only on ordinary real de Sitter and anti-de Sitter, but also\non the rational points of the quadratic equations that define these spaces. For\nthree-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, a simpler evolution rule is possible\nthat descends from the Wess-Zumino-Witten equations of motion. In this case,\none may replace three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space by a non-compact\ndiscrete subgroup of SL(2,R) whose structure is related to the Pell equation. A\ndiscrete version of the BTZ black hole can be constructed as a quotient of this\nsubgroup. This discrete black hole avoids the firewall paradox by a curious\nmechanism: even for large black holes, there are no points inside the horizon\nuntil one reaches the singularity.\n", "  We investigate effects of causal hydrodynamic fluctuations in the\nlongitudinally expanding quark gluon plasma on final entropy distributions in\nhigh-energy nuclear collisions.\n", "  We study the BPS Skyrme model with potentials breaking the isospin symmetry\nand analyse how properties of exact solitonic solutions depend on a form of the\nisospin breaking potential. In the case of the strong symmetry breaking a new\ntopologic structure is observed which enables us to decompose a BPS skyrmion\ninto a lower dimensional defect localised on a brane (kink). We investigate\nsome thermodynamical properties of such solitons as well as the role of the\nsymmetry breaking potential in the resulting mean-field equation of state.\n", "  We review the recent developments in the theory of jet-quenching. First, we\nanalyze the coherent vacuum cascade and incoherent medium-induced cascade\nseparately. We then discuss the interplay between the two kinds of cascade and\nthe resulting partial decoherence of the inner jet structure. Finally, we\nreport on recent calculations of higher-order corrections. In particular, the\ndominant radiative corrections to jet observables that yield the\nrenormalization of the jet-quenching parameter are addressed.\n", "  A dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber was built at Nikhef in Amsterdam\nas a direct dark matter detection R&D facility. In this paper, the setup is\npresented and the first results from a calibration with a $^{22}$Na gamma-ray\nsource are presented. The results show an average light yield of (5.6 $\\pm$\n0.3) photoelectrons/keV (calculated to 122 keV and zero field) and an electron\nlifetime of (429 $\\pm$ 26) $\\mu$s. The best energy resolution $\\sigma_E/E$ is\n(5.8 $\\pm$ 0.2)% at an energy of 511 keV. This was achieved using a combination\nof the scintillation and the ionization signals. A photomultiplier tube gain\ncalibration technique, based on the electroluminescence signals occurring from\nisolated electrons, is presented and its advantages and limitations are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The excellent particle identification capabilities of the ALICE detector,\nusing the time projection chamber and the time-of-flight detector, allow the\ndetection of light nuclei and anti-nuclei. Furthermore, the high tracking\nresolution provided by the inner tracking system enables the separation of\nprimary nuclei from those coming from the decay of heavier systems. This allows\nfor the reconstruction of decays such as the hypertriton mesonic weak decay\n($^3_{\\Lambda}$H$\\rightarrow ^3$He + $\\pi^-$), the decay of a hypothetical\nbound state of a $\\Lambda$n into a deuteron and pion or the H-dibaryon decaying\ninto a $\\Lambda$, a proton and a $\\pi^{-}$. An overview of the production of\nstable nuclei and anti-nuclei in proton-proton, proton-lead and, in particular,\nlead-lead collisions is presented. Hypernuclei production rates in Pb--Pb are\nalso shown, together with the upper limits estimated on the production of\nhypothetical exotica candidates. The results are compared with predictions for\nthe production in thermal (statistical) and coalescence models.\n", "  The nature of chiral phase transition for two flavor QCD is an interesting\nbut unresolved problem. One of the most intriguing issues is whether or not the\nanomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively restored along with\nthe chiral symmetry. This may determine the universality class of the chiral\nphase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is\nessentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to\naddress this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region. We observe\nthat the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the chiral crossover\nregion. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects\nsince the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it. We also provide a\nglimpse of the microscopic topological structures of the QCD medium that are\nresponsible for the strongly interacting nature of the quark gluon plasma\nphase. We study the effect of these microscopic constituents through our first\ncalculations for the topological susceptibility of QCD at finite temperature,\nwhich could be a crucial input for the equation of state for anomalous\nhydrodynamics.\n", "  Tethered particle motion (TPM) --- the motion of a micro- or nanoparticle\ntethered to a substrate by a macromolecule --- is a system that has proven\nextremely useful for its ability to reveal physical features of the tether,\nbecause the thermal motion of the bound particle reports sensitively on\nparameters like the length, the rigidity, or the folding state of its tether.\nIn this paper, we discuss a novel application of TPM, surveying its utility in\nprobing the kinetics of single secondary bonds: bonds that form and break\nbetween the tethered particle and a substrate due, for instance, to\nreceptor/ligand pairs on particle and substrate. Much like the tether itself\naffects the motion pattern, so do the presence and absence of such secondary\nconnections. Keeping the tether properties constant, we demonstrate how raw\npositional TPM data may be parsed to generate detailed insights into the\nassociation and dissociation kinetics of single secondary bonds. We do this\nusing coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, specifically developed to\ntreat the motion of particles close to interfaces.\n", "  Results are presented for the entanglement entropy and spectrum of\nhalf-filled graphene following the switch on of a circularly polarized laser.\nThe laser parameters are chosen to correspond to several different Floquet\nChern insulator phases. The entanglement properties of the unitarily evolved\nwavefunctions are compared with the state where one of the Floquet bands is\ncompletely occupied. The true states show a volume law for the entanglement,\nwhereas the Floquet states show an area law. Qualitative differences are found\nin the entanglement properties of the off-resonant and on-resonant laser. Edge\nstates are found in the entanglement spectrum corresponding to certain physical\nedge states expected in a Chern insulator. However, some edge states that would\nbe expected from the Floquet band structure are missing from the entanglement\nspectrum. An analytic theory is developed for the long time structure of the\nentanglement spectrum. It is argued that only edge states corresponding to\noff-resonant processes appear in the entanglement spectrum.\n", "  Using Monte Carlo simulations and extended mean field theory calculations we\nshow that the $3$-dimensional $Z_3$ spin model with complex external fields has\nnon-monotonic spatial correlators in some regions of its parameter space. This\nmodel serves as a proxy for heavy-dense QCD in $(3+1)$ dimensions.\nNon-monotonic spatial correlators are intrinsically related to a complex mass\nspectrum and a liquid-like (or crystalline) behavior. A liquid phase could have\nimplications for heavy-ion experiments, where it could leave detectable signals\nin the spatial correlations of baryons.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab aims to measure the charged lepton flavor\nviolating neutrinoless muon to electron conversion. The goal of the experiment\nis to reach a single event sensitivity of 2.5 x 10^{-17}, to set an upper limit\non the muon conversion rate at 6.7 x 10^{-17} in a three years run. For this\npurpose, the Mu2e detector is designed to identify electrons from muon\nconversion and reduce the background to a negligible level. It consists of a\nlow mass straw tracker and a pure CsI crystal calorimeter.\n  In this paper, the performance of undoped CsI single crystal is reported.\nCrystals from many vendors have been characterized by determining their Light\nYield (LY) and Longitudinal Response Uniformity (LRU), when read with a UV\nextended PMT, and their time resolution when coupled to a Silicon\nPhotomultiplier. The crystals show a LY of ~ 100 photoelectrons per MeV when\nwrapped with Tyvek and coupled to the PMT without optical grease. The LRU is\nwell represented by a linear slope that is on average 0.6%/cm. Both\nmeasurements have been performed using a 22Na source. The timing performance\nhave been evaluated exploiting minimum ionizing particles, with MPPC readout. A\ntiming resolution better than 400 ps is achieved (at ~20MeV).\n", "  Thermal noise generally greatly exceeds quantum noise in optomechanical\ndevices unless the mechanical frequency is very high or the thermodynamic\ntemperature is very low. This paper addresses the design concept for a novel\noptomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the audio\nfrequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a\nminimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror\nSloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a\nMembrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the\nhigh-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms\nwhich lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation\npressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using\nthe Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical\ntrapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most\nimportant being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that\npractical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz,\ncould achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring\nstiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 $\\mu$g or less could\nachieve a Q-factor of $10^{11}$ at a frequency of 100 kHz. Applications for\nsuch devices include white light cavities for improvement of gravitational wave\ndetectors, or sensors able to operate near the quantum limit.\n", "  The proton transfer ${\\rm{^7Be}}$($d$,$n$)${\\rm{^8B}}$ reaction at the energy\nof 4.5 MeV (c.m.) has been analysed within the modified DWBA. New estimates and\ntheir uncertainties are obtained for values of the asymptotic normalization\ncoefficients for $p + {\\rm{^7Be}} \\to {\\rm{^8B}}$, the astrophysical\n$S_{17}(0)$ factor and the s-wave $p + {\\rm{^7Be}}$ scattering lengths.\n", "  An exact statistical mechanical derivation is given of the critical Casimir\ninteractions between two defects in a planar lattice-gas Ising model. Each\ndefect is a group of nearest-neighbor spins with modified coupling constants.\nSuch a system can be regarded as a model of a binary liquid mixture with the\nmolecules confined to a membrane and the defects mimicking protein inclusions\nembedded into the membrane. As suggested by recent experiments, certain\ncellular membranes appear to be tuned to the proximity of a critical demixing\npoint belonging to the two-dimensional Ising universality class. Therefore one\ncan expect the emergence of critical Casimir forces between membrane\ninclusions. These forces are governed by universal scaling functions, which we\nderive for simple defects. We prove that the scaling law appearing at\ncriticality is the same for all types of defects considered here.\n", "  Motivated by aLIGO's recent discovery of gravitational waves we discuss\nsignatures of new physics that could be seen at ground and space-based\ninterferometers. We show that a first order phase transition in a dark sector\nwould lead to a detectable gravitational wave signal at future experiments, if\nthe phase transition has occurred at temperatures few orders of magnitude\nhigher than the electroweak scale. The source of gravitational waves in this\ncase is associated with the dynamics of expanding and colliding bubbles in the\nearly universe. At the same time we point out that topological defects, such as\ndark sector domain walls, may generate a detectable signal already at aLIGO.\nBoth -- bubble and domain wall -- scenarios are sourced by semi-classical\nconfigurations of a dark new physics sector. In the first case the\ngravitational wave signal originates from bubble wall collisions and subsequent\nturbulence in hot plasma in the early universe, while the second case\ncorresponds to domain walls passing through the interferometer at present and\nis not related to gravitational waves. We find that aLIGO at its current\nsensitivity can detect smoking-gun signatures from domain wall interactions,\nwhile future proposed experiments including the fifth phase of aLIGO at design\nsensitivity can probe dark sector phase transitions.\n", "  We review the recently constructed non-trivial fermionic representations of\nthe infinite-dimensional subalgebra K(E10) of the hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra\nE10. These representations are all unfaithful (and more specifically, of finite\ndimension). In addition we present their decompositions under the various\nfinite-dimensional subgroups associated with some maximal supergravities in\ndimensions D<=11, and the projectors for `spin-7/2' which have not been given\nbefore. Those representations that have not been derived from supergravity\nstill have to find a role and a proper physical interpretation in the\nconjectured correspondence between E10 and M-theory. Nevertheless, they provide\nnovel mathematical structures that could shed some light on fundamental\nquestions in supergravity and on the possible role of K(E10) as an `R-symmetry'\nof M-theory, and perhaps also on the algebra E10 itself.\n", "  We generalize the construction by Aharony, Hashimoto, Hirano, and Ouyang of\n${\\cal N}=4$ quiver gauge theory with gauge group $U(N+M) \\times U(N)$, $k$\nfundamentals charged under $U(N)$ and bi-fundamentals, to the case with gauge\ngroup $\\prod_{i=1}^{\\hat k} U(N_i)$ with $k_i$ fundamentals charged under\n$U(N_i)$. This construction is facilitated by considering the resolved\n$ALE_{\\hat k} \\times TN_{k}$ background in M-theory including non-trivial\nfluxes through the resolved 4-cycles in the geometry. We also describe the\nM-theory lift of the IIA Page charge quantization condition. Finally, we\nclarify the role of string corrections in various regimes of parameter space.\n", "  The low statistical errors on cosmological parameters promised by future\ngalaxy surveys will only be realised with the development of new, fast,\nanalysis methods that reduce potential systematic problems to low levels. We\npresent an efficient method for measuring the evolution of the growth of\nstructure using Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), that removes the need to make\nmeasurements in redshift shells. We provide sets of galaxy-weights that cover a\nwide range in redshift, but are optimised to provide differential information\nabout cosmological evolution. These are derived to optimally measure the\ncoefficients of a parameterisation of the redshift-dependent matter density,\nwhich provides a framework to measure deviations from the concordance\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, allowing for deviations in both geometric and/or\ngrowth. We test the robustness of the weights by comparing with alternative\nschemes and investigate the impact of galaxy bias. We extend the results to\nmeasure the combined anisotropic Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and RSD\nsignals.\n", "  In this article we study restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature\nfor quark matter with a chiral chemical potential, $\\mu_5$, by means of a\nnonlocal Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. This model allows to introduce in the\nsimplest way possible a Euclidean momentum, $p_E$, dependent quark mass\nfunction which decays (neglecting logarithms) as $1/p_E^2$ for large $p_E$, in\nagreement with asymptotic behaviour expected in QCD in presence of a\nnonperturbative quark condensate. We focus on the critical temperature for\nchiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit, $T_c$, versus $\\mu_5$, as well\nas on the order of the phase transition. We find that $T_c$ increases with\n$\\mu_5$, and that the transition remains of the second order for the whole\nrange of $\\mu_5$ considered.\n", "  We propose a model where sterile neutrinos are introduced to make light\nneutrinos to be pseudo-Dirac particles. It is shown how tiny mass splitting\nnecessary for realizing pseudo-Dirac neutrinos can be achieved. Within the\nmodel, we show how leptogenesis can be successfully generated. Motivated by the\nrecent observation of very high energy neutrino events at IceCube, we study a\npossibility to observe the effects of the pseudo-Dirac property of neutrinos by\nperforming astronomical-scale baseline experiments to uncover the oscillation\neffects of very tiny mass splitting. Using the result of global fit to neutrino\ndata for the input of neutrino mixing angles and CP phase at $1\\sigma$ C.L. and\nfixing neutrino energy and mass splittings, we study how the oscillation\neffects induced by pseudo-Dirac neutrinos may affect the track-to-shower ratio\nobtained from IceCube data. We also discuss future prospect to observe the\neffects of the pseudo-Dirac property of neutrinos at high energy neutrino\nexperiments.\n", "  We revisit the Schwinger effect in de Sitter, anti-de Sitter spaces and\ncharged black holes, and explore the interplay between quantum electrodynamics\nand the quantum gravity effect at one-loop level. We then advance a thermal\ninterpretation of the Schwinger effect in curved spacetimes. Finally, we show\nthat the Schwinger effect in a near-extremal black hole differs from Hawking\nradiation of charged particles in a non-extremal black hole and is factorized\ninto those in an anti-de Sitter space and a Rindler space with the surface\ngravity for acceleration.\n", "  Cosmology and particle physics have long been dominated by theoretical\nparadigms: Einstein's general theory of relativity in cosmology and the\nStandard Model of particle physics. The time may have come for paradigm shifts.\nDoes cosmological inflation require a modification of Einstein's gravity? Have\nexperiments at the LHC discovered a new particle beyond the Standard Model? It\nis premature to answer these questions, but we theorists can dream about the\npossibilities.\n", "  Nonspherical mass motions are a generic feature of core-collapse supernovae,\nand hydrodynamic instabilities play a crucial role for the explosion mechanism.\nFirst successful neutrino-driven explosions could be obtained with\nself-consistent, first-principle simulations in three spatial dimensions (3D).\nBut 3D models tend to be less prone to explosion than corresponding\naxisymmetric (2D) ones. This has been explained by 3D turbulence leading to\nenergy cascading from large to small spatial scales, inversely to the 2D case,\nthus disfavoring the growth of buoyant plumes on the largest scales. Unless the\ninertia to explode simply reflects a lack of sufficient resolution in relevant\nregions, it suggests that some important aspect may still be missing for robust\nand sufficiently energetic neutrino-powered explosions. Such deficits could be\nassociated with progenitor properties like rotation, magnetic fields or\npre-collapse perturbations, or with microphysics that could lead to an\nenhancement of neutrino heating behind the shock. 3D simulations have also\nrevealed new phenomena that are not present in 2D, for example spiral modes of\nthe standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and a stunning dipolar\nlepton-emission self-sustained asymmetry (LESA). Both impose time- and\ndirection-dependent variations on the detectable neutrino signal. The\nunderstanding of these effects and of their consequences is still in its\ninfancy.\n", "  We construct net baryon number and strangeness susceptibilities as well as\ncorrelations between electric charge, strangeness and baryon number from\nexperimental data on the particle production yields at midrapidity of the ALICE\nCollaboration at CERN. The data were taken in central Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$~=~2.76~TeV and cover one unit of rapidity. We show that the\nresulting fluctuations and correlations are consistent with Lattice QCD results\nat the chiral crossover pseudocritical temperature $T_{c} \\simeq$ 155 MeV. This\nagreement lends strong support to the assumption that the fireball created in\nthese collisions is of thermal origin and exhibits characteristic properties\nexpected in QCD at the transition from the quark gluon plasma to the hadronic\nphase. Since Lattice QCD calculations are performed at a baryochemical\npotential of $\\mu_{B}$ = 0, the comparisons with LHC data are the most direct\ndue to the vanishing baryon transport to midrapidity at these high energies.\n", "  We analyze and show experimental results of the conditional purity, the\nquantum discord and other related measures of quantum correlation in mixed\ntwo-qubit states constructed from a pair of photons in identical polarization\nstates. The considered states are relevant for the description of spin pair\nstates in interacting spin chains in a transverse magnetic field. We derive\nclean analytical expressions for the conditional local purity and other\ncorrelation measures obtained as a result of a remote local projective\nmeasurement, which are fully verified by the experimental results. A simple\nexact expression for the quantum discord of these states in terms of the\nmaximum conditional purity is also derived.\n", "  We study the effective cosmological dynamics, emerging as the hydrodynamics\nof simple condensate states, of a group field theory model for quantum gravity\ncoupled to a massless scalar field and reduced to its isotropic sector. The\nquantum equations of motion for these group field theory condensate states are\ngiven in relational terms with respect to the scalar field, from which\neffective dynamics for spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic space-times\ncan be extracted. The result is a generalization of the Friedmann equations,\nincluding quantum gravity modifications, in a specific regime of the theory\ncorresponding to a Gross-Pitaevskii approximation where interactions are\nsubdominant. The classical Friedmann equations of general relativity are\nrecovered in a suitable semi-classical limit for some range of parameters of\nthe microscopic dynamics. An important result is that the quantum geometries\nassociated with these GFT condensate states are non-singular: a bounce\ngenerically occurs in the Planck regime. For some choices of condensate states,\nthese modified Friedmann equations are very similar to those of loop quantum\ncosmology.\n", "  We propose a lower bound of the dc electrical conductivity in strongly\ndisordered, strongly interacting quantum field theories using holography. We\nstudy linear response of black holes with broken translational symmetry in\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theories of gravity. Using the generalized Stokes\nequations at the horizon, we derive the lower bound of the electrical\nconductivity for the dual two dimensional disordered field theory.\n", "  It is pointed out that in a wide class of models reminiscent of type-II\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDM) the signal of the Higgs produced in association\nwith a top-antitop quark pair ($tth$) and decaying into gauge bosons can be\nsignificantly larger than the Standard Model (SM) prediction without violating\nany experimental constraints. The crucial feature of these models is enhanced\n(suppressed) Higgs coupling to top (bottom) quarks and existence of light\ncolored particles that give negative contribution to the effective Higgs\ncoupling to gluons resulting in the gluon fusion rates in the gauge boson decay\nchannels close to SM predictions. We demonstrate this mechanism in NMSSM with\nlight stops and show that $tth$ signal in the $WW$ decay channel can be two\ntimes larger than the SM prediction, as suggested by the excesses observed by\nATLAS and CMS, provided that the Higgs-singlet superpotential coupling\n$\\lambda\\gtrsim0.8$ and the MSSM-like Higgs boson masses are in the range of\n160 to 300 GeV.\n", "  From higher dimensional theories, e.g. string theory, one expects the\npresence of non-minimally coupled scalar fields. We review the notion of\nconformal frames in cosmology and emphasize their physical equivalence, which\nholds at least at a classical level.\n  Furthermore, if there is a field, or fields, which dominates the universe, as\nit is often the case in cosmology, we can use such notion of frames to treat\nour system, matter and gravity, as two different sectors. On one hand, the\ngravity sector which describes the dynamics of the geometry and on the other\nhand the matter sector which has such geometry as a playground. We use this\ninterpretation to build a model where the fact that a curvaton couples to a\nparticular frame metric could leave an imprint in the CMB.\n", "  Motivated by recent results in stellar evolution that predict the existence\nof hybrid white dwarf (WD) stars with a C-O core inside an O-Ne shell, we\nsimulate thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae from these hybrid progenitors. We\nuse the FLASH code to perform multidimensional simulations in the deflagration\nto detonation transition (DDT) explosion paradigm. Our hybrid progenitor models\nwere produced with the MESA stellar evolution code and include the effects of\nthe Urca process, and we map the progenitor model to the FLASH grid. We\nperformed a suite of DDT simulations over a range of ignition conditions\nconsistent with the progenitor's thermal and convective structure assuming\nmultiple ignition points. To compare the results from these hybrid WD stars to\nprevious results from C-O white dwarfs, we construct a set of C-O WD models\nwith similar properties and similarly simulate a suite of explosions. We find\nthat despite significant variability within each suite, trends distinguishing\nthe explosions are apparent in their $^{56}$Ni yields and the kinetic\nproperties of the ejecta. We comment on the feasibility of these explosions as\nthe source of some classes of observed subluminous events.\n", "  Adiabatic techniques are known to allow for engineering quantum states with\nhigh fidelity. This requirement is currently of large interest, as applications\nin quantum information require the preparation and manipulation of quantum\nstates with minimal errors. Here we review recent progress on developing\ntechniques for the preparation of spatial states through adiabatic passage,\nparticularly focusing on three state systems. These techniques can be applied\nto matter waves in external potentials, such as cold atoms or electrons, and to\nclassical waves in waveguides, such as light or sound.\n", "  In a previous work we presented a theoretical analysis of the $\\Lambda_b \\to\nJ/\\psi K^- p$ reaction from where a recent experiment by the LHCb collaboration\nat CERN claimed the existence of two hidden charm pentaquarks, $P_c(4380)^+$\nand $P_c(4450)^+$. In that work we focused only on the $\\Lambda(1405)$ and\n$P_c(4450)^+$ signals and discussed the possible explanation of this pentaquark\nstate within the picture of a dynamical meson-baryon molecule made up mostly\nfrom $\\bar D^* \\Sigma_c$ and $\\bar D^* \\Sigma^*_c$ components. In the present\nwork we improve upon the previous one by considering the total $K^- p$ and\n$J/\\psi p$ data including all the relevant resonances contributing to the\nspectra, and discuss the possible nature of both $P_c(4380)^+$ and\n$P_c(4450)^+$. We also discuss several important topics, like the effect of the\ncontact term in the reaction, the viability of reproducing the data without the\n$P_c(4380)^+$ and the possible quantum numbers assignment to these pentaquarks.\n", "  We construct an extremal chiral $\\mathcal N=4$ superconformal field theory\nwith central charge 24 from a $\\mathbb Z_2$ orbifold of the chiral bosonic\ntheory with target $\\mathbb R^{24}/\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the Niemeier\nlattice with root system $A_2^{12}$. This construction is analogous to\nconstructions of extremal chiral $\\mathcal N=1$ and $\\mathcal N=2$ CFTs with\n$c=24$, where $\\Lambda = \\Lambda_{Leech}$ and the Niemeier lattice with root\nsystem $A_1^{24}$, respectively. The theory has a discrete symmetry group\nrelated to the sporadic group $M_{11}$.\n", "  We put forward a proposal that combines objective collapse models, developed\nin connection with quantum-foundational questions, with the so-called Weyl\ncurvature hypothesis, introduced by Roger Penrose as an attempt to account for\nthe very special initial state of the universe. In particular, we explain how a\ncurvature dependence of the collapse rate in such models, an idea already shown\nto help in the context of black holes and information loss, could also offer a\ndynamical justification for Penrose's conjecture.\n", "  We present a new numerical system using classical finite elements with mesh\nadaptivity for computing stationary solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\nThe programs are written as a toolbox for FreeFem++ (www.freefem.org), a free\nfinite-element software available for all existing operating systems. This\noffers the advantage to hide all technical issues related to the implementation\nof the finite element method, allowing to easily implement various numerical\nalgorithms.Two robust and optimised numerical methods were implemented to\nminimize the Gross-Pitaevskii energy: a steepest descent method based on\nSobolev gradients and a minimization algorithm based on the state-of-the-art\noptimization library Ipopt. For both methods, mesh adaptivity strategies are\nimplemented to reduce the computational time and increase the local spatial\naccuracy when vortices are present. Different run cases are made available for\n2D and 3D configurations of Bose-Einstein condensates in rotation. An optional\ngraphical user interface is also provided, allowing to easily run predefined\ncases or with user-defined parameter files. We also provide several\npost-processing tools (like the identification of quantized vortices) that\ncould help in extracting physical features from the simulations. The toolbox is\nextremely versatile and can be easily adapted to deal with different physical\nmodels.\n", "  In this paper, we study the quantum properties of a bilayer graphene with\n(asymmetry) line defects. The localized states are found around the line\ndefects. Thus, the line defects on one certain layer of the bilayer graphene\ncan lead to an electric transport channel. By adding a bias potential along the\ndirection of the line defects, we calculate the electric conductivity of\nbilayer graphene with line defects using Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker theory, and show\nthat the channel affects the electric conductivity remarkably by comparing the\nresults with those in a perfect bilayer graphene. This one-dimensional line\nelectric channel has the potential to be applied in the nanotechnology\nengineering.\n", "  We extend our earlier calculations of the spectrum of closed flux tubes in\nSU(N) gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions, with a focus on questions raised by\nrecent theoretical progress on the effective string action of long flux tubes\nand the world-sheet action for flux tubes of moderate lengths. Our new\ncalculations in SU(4) and SU(8) provide evidence that the leading O(1/l^gamma)\nnon-universal correction to the flux tube ground state energy does indeed have\na power gamma greater than or equal to 7. We perform a study in SU(2), where we\ncan traverse the length at which the Nambu-Goto ground state becomes tachyonic,\nto obtain an all-N view of the spectrum. Our comparison of the k=2 flux tube\nexcitation energies in SU(4) and SU(6) suggests that the massive world sheet\nexcitation associated with the k=2 binding has a scale that knows about the\ngroup and hence the theory in the bulk, and we comment on the potential\nimplications of world sheet massive modes for the bulk spectrum. We provide a\nquantitative analysis of the surprising (near-)orthogonality of flux tubes\ncarrying flux in different SU(N) representations, which implies that their\nscreening by gluons is highly suppressed even at small N.\n", "  We investigate the experimentally-accessible kinematic distributions of the\n$\\bar B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau^-(\\to\\ell^-\\bar\\nu_\\ell\\nu_\\tau)\\bar\\nu_\\tau$ decays.\nSpecifically, we study the decay rates as functions of the $B\\to D^{(*)}$\ntransferred squared momentum, the energy of the final charged lepton and the\nangle of its 3-momentum relative to the 3-momentum of the recoiling $D^{(*)}$.\nThe angular distribution allows to introduce new observables, like a\nforward-backward asymmetry, which are complementary to the total rates. We\npresent analytic formulas for the observable 3-fold 5-body differential decay\nrates, study the predictions in the Standard Model and investigate the effects\nin different new-physics scenarios that we characterize using an effective\nfield theory framework.\n", "  The topic of superconductivity in strongly disordered materials has attracted\na significant attention. In particular vivid debates are related to the subject\nof intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity responsible for non-BCS relation between the\nsuperconducting gap and the pairing potential. Here we report experimental\nstudy of electron transport properties of narrow NbN nanowires with effective\ncross sections of the order of the debated inhomogeneity scales. We find that\nconventional models based on phase slip concept provide reasonable fits for the\nshape of the R(T) transition curve. Temperature dependence of the critical\ncurrent follows the text-book Ginzburg-Landau prediction for\nquasi-one-dimensional superconducting channel Ic~(1-T/Tc)^3/2. Hence, one may\nconclude that the intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity either does not exist in\nour structures, or, if exist, does not affect their resistive state properties.\n", "  Josza's definition of fidelity for a pair of (mixed) quantum states is\nstudied in the context of two types of operator algebras. The first setting is\nmainly algebraic in that it involves unital C$^*$-algebras $A$ that possess a\nfaithful trace functional $\\tau$. In this context, the role of quantum states\n(that is, density operators) in the classical quantum-mechanical framework is\nassumed by positive elements $\\rho\\in A$ for which $\\tau(\\rho)=1$. The second\nof our two settings is more operator theoretic: by fixing a faithful normal\nsemifinite trace $\\tau$ on a semifinite von Neumann algebra $M$, we define and\nconsider the fidelity of pairs of positive operators in $M$ of unit trace. The\nmain results of this paper address monotonicity and preservation of fidelity\nunder the action of certain trace-preserving positive linear maps of $A$ or of\nthe predual $M_*$. Our results also yield a new proof of a theorem of Moln\\'ar\non the structure of quantum channels on the trace-class operators that preserve\nfidelity.\n", "  Thermal states of quantum systems with many degrees of freedom are subject to\na bound on the rate of onset of chaos, including a bound on the Lyapunov\nexponent, $\\lambda_L\\leq 2\\pi /\\beta$. We harness this bound to constrain the\nspace of putative holographic CFTs and their would-be dual theories of AdS\ngravity. First, by studying out-of-time-order four-point functions, we discuss\nhow $\\lambda_L=2\\pi/\\beta$ in ordinary two-dimensional holographic CFTs is\nrelated to properties of the OPE at strong coupling. We then rule out the\nexistence of unitary, sparse two-dimensional CFTs with large central charge and\na set of higher spin currents of bounded spin; this implies the inconsistency\nof weakly coupled AdS$_3$ higher spin gravities without infinite towers of\ngauge fields, such as the $SL(N)$ theories. This fits naturally with the\nstructure of higher-dimensional gravity, where finite towers of higher spin\nfields lead to acausality. On the other hand, unitary CFTs with classical\n$W_{\\infty}[\\lambda]$ symmetry, dual to 3D Vasiliev or hs[$\\lambda$] higher\nspin gravities, do not violate the chaos bound, instead exhibiting no chaos:\n$\\lambda_L=0$. Independently, we show that such theories violate unitarity for\n$|\\lambda|>2$. These results encourage a tensionless string theory\ninterpretation of the 3D Vasiliev theory. We also perform some CFT calculations\nof chaos in Rindler space in various dimensions.\n", "  We study dynamics of (m,n)-string in (p,q)-five brane and (p,q)-string\nbackground. We determine world-volume stress energy tensor and we analyze the\ndependence of the string's dynamics on the values of the charges (m,n) and the\nvalue of the angular momentum.\n", "  In this article, using the language of jet space, we propose a functional\nclass space for pseudo-local functionals. We test this functional class\nproposal in a number of examples ranging from string-field-theory to AdS/CFT\ndualities. Implications of the locality proposal at the quartic order are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We present arguments which suggest that the bulk higher-spin gravity duals of\nweakly-coupled conformal field theories obey some refined notion of locality.\nIn particular, we discuss the Mellin amplitude programme in this context. We\nfocus on the $O(N)$ vector model and minimal higher-spin gravity as a\nparadigmatic example of such holographic dual pairs. We restrict ourselves to\nthree- and four-point functions of scalar primary operators, but the\nqualitative conclusions are expected to hold for the generic case.\n", "  We consider the spectrum of the almost Mathieu operator $H_\\alpha$ with\nfrequency $\\alpha$ and in the case of the critical coupling. Let an irrational\n$\\alpha$ be such that $|\\alpha-p_n/q_n|<c q_n^{-\\varkappa}$, where $p_n/q_n$,\n$n=1,2,\\dots$ are the convergents to $\\alpha$, and $c$, $\\varkappa$ are\npositive absolute constants, $\\varkappa<56$. Assuming certain conditions on the\nparity of the coefficients of the continued fraction of $\\alpha$, we show that\nthe central gaps of $H_{p_n/q_n}$, $n=1,2,\\dots$, are inherited as spectral\ngaps of $H_\\alpha$ of length at least $c'q_n^{-\\varkappa/2}$, $c'>0$.\n", "  We present the results of systematic experimental investigations and\nmicromagnetic simulations for the ferromagnetic resonance in rectangular\npermalloy microstripes. It is shown that the resonant magnetization\noscillations have a complex spatial structure including a quasi-homogeneous\nprecession, lateral spin-wave resonances and localized edge modes, which\nstrongly depend on sample orientation in an external magnetic field.\n", "  Any N=2 superconformal field theory (SCFT) in four dimensions has a sector of\noperators related to a two-dimensional chiral algebra containing a Virasoro\nsub-algebra. Moreover, there are well-known examples of isolated SCFTs whose\nchiral algebra is a Virasoro algebra. In this note, we consider the chiral\nalgebras associated with interacting N=2 SCFTs possessing an exactly marginal\ndeformation that can be interpreted as a gauge coupling (i.e., at special\npoints on the resulting conformal manifolds, free gauge fields appear that\ndecouple from isolated SCFT building blocks). At any point on these conformal\nmanifolds, we argue that the associated chiral algebras possess at least three\ngenerators. In addition, we show that there are examples of SCFTs realizing\nsuch a minimal chiral algebra: they are certain points on the conformal\nmanifold obtained by considering the low-energy limit of type IIB string theory\non the three complex-dimensional hypersurface singularity x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3+A\nx_1x_2x_3+w^2=0. The associated chiral algebra is the A(6) theory of Feigin,\nFeigin, and Tipunin. As byproducts of our work, we argue that (i) a collection\nof isolated theories can be conformally gauged only if there is a SUSY moduli\nspace associated with the corresponding symmetry current moment maps in each\nsector, and (ii) N=2 SCFTs with a>=c have hidden fermionic symmetries (in the\nsense of fermionic chiral algebra generators).\n", "  Motivated by the recent work by Mandal and Jarzynski on autonomous Maxwell\ndemon information engine, we have extended their model by introducing two\ndifferent heat baths. The system (demon) is coupled to a memory register (tape)\nand a work source. The performance of the system depends on the interplay\nbetween these two sources along with the heat baths.\n  We have found the system can act as an engine, refrigerator or an eraser.\nEven the combination of any two is possible in some parameter space. We have\nachieved the efficiency of the engine is greater than Carnot limit. The\ncoefficient of performance of refrigerator also achieves larger than Carnot\nlimit.\n", "  Continuous-time Markov process models of contagions are widely studied, not\nleast because of their utility in predicting the evolution of real-world\ncontagions and in formulating control measures. It is often the case, however,\nthat discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to\nsimulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform\nsteps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition\nprobabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this\napproach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of\nthe model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical\nsimulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type\nupdating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against\ncontinuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie\nalgorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of\nreplicating the continuous-time process and computational speed. Finally, we\nshow how discretizing time can affect the value of the epidemic threshold for\nlarge values of the infection rate and the recovery rate, even if the ratio\nbetween the former and the latter is small.\n", "  Extratropical extreme precipitation events are usually associated with\nlarge-scale flow disturbances, strong ascent and large latent heat release. The\ncausal relationships between these factors are often not obvious, however, and\nthe roles of different physical processes in producing the extreme\nprecipitation event can be difficult to disentangle. Here, we examine the\nlarge-scale forcings and convective heating feedback in the precipitation\nevents which caused the 2010 Pakistan flood within the Column Quasi-Geostrophic\nframework. A cloud-revolving model (CRM) is forced with the large-scale\nforcings (other than large-scale vertical motion) computed from the\nquasi-geostrophic omega equation with input data from a reanalysis data set,\nand the large-scale vertical motion is diagnosed interactively with the\nsimulated convection.\n  Numerical results show that the positive feedback of convective heating to\nlarge-scale dynamics is essential in amplifying the precipitation intensity to\nthe observed values. Orographic lifting is the most important dynamic forcing\nin both events, while differential potential vorticity advection also\ncontributes to the triggering of the first event. Horizontal moisture advection\nmodulates the extreme events mainly by setting the environmental humidity,\nwhich modulates the amplitude of the convection's response to the dynamic\nforcings. When the CRM is replaced by either a single-column model (SCM) with\nparameterized convection or a dry model with a reduced effective static\nstability, the model results show substantial discrepancies compared with\nreanalysis data. The reasons for these discrepancies are examined, and the\nimplications for global models and theoretical models are discussed.\n", "  The \"failed Kondo insulator\" CeNiSn has long been suspected to be a nodal\nmetal, with a node in the hybridization matrix elements. Here we carry out a\nseries of Nernst effect experiments to delineate whether the severely\nanisotropic magnetotransport coefficients do indeed derive from a nodal metal\nor can simply be explained by a highly anisotropic Fermi surface. Our\nexperiments reveal that despite an almost 20-fold anisotropy in the Hall\nconductivity, the large Nernst signal is isotropic. Taken in conjunction with\nthe magnetotransport anisotropy, these results provide strong support for an\nisotropic Fermi surface with a large anisotropy in quasiparticle mass derived\nfrom a nodal hybridization.\n", "  We show that majorization provides a powerful approach to the coherence\nconveyed by partially polarized transversal electromagnetic waves. Here we\npresent the formalism, provide some examples and compare with standard measures\nof polarization and coherence of vectorial waves.\n", "  We demonstrate coherent control of multiphoton and above-threshold\nphotoemission from a single solid-state nanoemitter driven by a fundamental and\na weak second harmonic laser pulse. Depending on the relative phase of the two\npulses, electron emission is modulated with a contrast of the oscillating\ncurrent signal of up to 94%. Electron spectra reveal that all observed photon\norders are affected simultaneously and similarly. We confirm that photoemission\ntakes place within 10 fs. Accompanying simulations indicate that the current\nmodulation with its large contrast results from two interfering quantum\npathways leading to electron emission.\n", "  General aspects of higher-spin gauge theory and unfolded formulation are\nbriefly recalled with some emphasize on the recent results on the breaking of\n$sp(8)$ symmetry by current interactions and construction of invariant\nfunctionals relevant to the higher-spin holography.\n", "  In this paper we report the evaluation of an optical lattice clock based on\nneutral mercury down to a relative uncertainty of $1.7\\times 10^{-16}$.\nComparing this characterized frequency standard to a Cs atomic fountain we\ndetermine the absolute frequency of the $^1S_0 \\rightarrow \\phantom{}^3P_0$\ntransition of $^{199}$Hg as $\\nu_{\\mathrm{Hg}} = 1\n128\\,575\\,290\\,808\\,154.62\\,$Hz $\\pm\\,0.19\\,$Hz (statistical) $\\pm\\,0.38\\,$Hz\n(systematic), limited solely by the realization of the SI second. Furthermore,\nby comparing the mercury optical lattice clock to a Rb atomic fountain, we\ndetermine for the first time to our knowledge the ratio between the $^{199}$Hg\nclock transition and the $^{87}$Rb ground state hyperfine transition. Finally\nwe present a direct optical to optical measurement of the $^{199}$Hg/$^{87}$Sr\nfrequency ratio. The obtained value of\n$\\nu_{\\mathrm{Hg}}/\\nu_{\\mathrm{Sr}}=2.629\\,314\\,209\\,898\\,909\\,15$ with a\nfractional uncertainty of $1.8\\times10^{-16}$ is in excellent agreement with\nthe same measurement obtained by Yamanaka et al. (arXiv:1503.07941). This makes\nthis frequency ratio one of the few physical quantities agreed upon by\ndifferent laboratories to this level of uncertainty. Frequency ratio\nmeasurements of the kind of those reported in this paper have a strong impact\nfor frequency metrology but also for fundamental physics as they can be used to\nmonitor putative variations of fundamental constants.\n", "  We employ low-frequency Raman spectroscopy to study the nearly commensurate\n(NC) to commensurate (C) charge density wave (CDW) transition in 1T-TaS2\nultrathin flakes protected from oxidation. We identify new modes originating\nfrom C phase CDW phonons that are distinct from those seen in bulk 1T-TaS2. We\nattribute these to CDW modes from the surface layers. By monitoring individual\nmodes with temperature, we find that surfaces undergo a separate,\nlow-hysteresis NC-C phase transition that is decoupled from the transition in\nthe bulk layers. This indicates the activation of a secondary phase nucleation\nprocess in the limit of weak interlayer interaction, which can be understood\nfrom energy considerations.\n", "  It is shown that large chemical potential leads to the significant increase\nof multiplicity fluctuations for bosons, and makes the fluctuations infinite in\nthe case of Bose-Einstein condensation. It allows to distinguish between the\nmodels that explain the anomalous proton to pion ratio and the low transverse\nmomentum enhancement of pion spectra in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC within\nchemical equilibrium or non-equilibrium models. The effects of resonance\ndecays, finite size of the system, requirements to the event statistics,\ndifferent momentum cuts, and limited detector acceptance are considered. The\nobtained results show the possibility to observe a substantial increase of the\nnormalized kurtosis for positively or negatively charged pions in the case of\nnon-equilibrium or partial pion condensation using currently measured data.\n", "  The quasiconformal method provides us with a unified approach to the\nconstruction of minimal unitary representations (minrep) of noncompact groups,\ntheir deformations as well as their supersymmetric extensions. We review the\nquasiconformal construction of the minrep of SO(d,2), its deformations and\ntheir applications to unitary realizations of AdS_{(d+1)}/CFT_d higher spin\nalgebras and their deformations for arbitrary d and supersymmetric extensions\nfor dimensions d less than seven. AdS_{(d+1)}/CFT_d higher spin algebras, their\ndeformations and supersymmetric extensions are given by the enveloping algebras\nof the quasiconformal realizations of the minrep, its deformations and\nsupersymmetric extensions, respectively, and are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith massless conformal fields for arbitrary d and massless conformal\nsupermultiplets for dimensions d less than seven.\n", "  In this work we show how a vector-valued version of Schechtman's empirical\nmethod can be used to reduce the number of inputs in a nonlocal game $G$ while\npreserving the quotient $\\beta^*(G)/\\beta(G)$ of the quantum over the classical\nbias. We apply our method to the Khot-Vishnoi game, with exponentially many\nquestions per player, to produce another game with polynomially many ($N\\approx\nn^8$) questions so that the quantum over the classical bias is $\\Omega\n(n/\\log^2 n)$.\n", "  We review the derivation of light-cone interaction vertices for fermionic and\nbosonic fields of arbitrary spin. The resulting amplitudes and their\nfactorization properties are discussed. We then show how this symmetry-based\napproach works for theories with extended supersymmetry like N=4 Yang-Mills\ntheory and N=8 supergravity.\n", "  We have recently introduced the Vernier-based Direct Frequency Comb\nCavity-Enhanced Spectroscopy technique and we present the corresponding\nformalism for quantitative broadband spectroscopy. We achieve high sensitivity\nand broadband performance by acquiring spectra covering more than 2000\ncm$^{-1}$ around 12600 cm$^{-1}$ (800 nm), resolving the 3$\\nu$+$\\delta$ band\nof water vapor and the entire A-band of oxygen in ambient air. 31 300\nindependent spectral elements are acquired at the second time scale with an\nabsorption baseline noise of 2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ cm$^{-1}$ providing a merit\nfigure of 1,1.10$^{-10}$ cm$^{-1}$/$\\sqrt{Hz}$ with a cavity finesse of 3000\nand a cavity round-trip length around 3,3 m. This state-of-the-art performance\nis reached through a continuous Vernier filtering of a Titanium:Saphire\nfrequency comb with the cavity grid of resonances, obtained when the cavity\nfree spectral range and the laser repetition rate are slightly mismatched.\nHere, we discuss the effect of the Vernier filtering on the measured absorbtion\nlineshape and we derive the formalism needed to fit molecular spectra.\n", "  The low-energy spectra of many body systems on a torus, of finite size $L$,\nare well understood in magnetically ordered and gapped topological phases.\nHowever, the spectra at quantum critical points separating such phases are\nlargely unexplored for 2+1D systems. Using a combination of analytical and\nnumerical techniques, we show that the low-energy torus spectrum at criticality\nprovides a universal fingerprint of the underlying quantum field theory, with\nthe energy levels given by universal numbers times $1/L$. We highlight the\nimplications of a neighboring topological phase on the spectrum by studying the\nIsing* transition (i.e. the transition between a $Z_2$ topological phase and a\ntrivial paramagnet), in the example of the toric code in a longitudinal field,\nand advocate a phenomenological picture that provides insight into the operator\ncontent of the critical field theory.\n", "  We consider the free propagation of totally symmetric massive bosonic fields\nin nontrivial backgrounds. The mutual compatibility of the dynamical equations\nand constraints in flat space amounts to the existence of an Abelian algebra\nformed by the d'Alembertian, divergence and trace operators. The latter, along\nwith the symmetrized gradient, symmetrized metric and spin operators, actually\ngenerate a bigger non-Abelian algebra, which we refer to as the \"consistency\"\nalgebra. We argue that in nontrivial backgrounds, it is some deformed version\nof this algebra that governs the consistency of the system. This can be\nmotivated, for example, from the theory of charged open strings in a background\ngauge field, where the Virasoro algebra ensures consistent propagation. For a\ngravitational background, we outline a systematic procedure of deforming the\ngenerators of the consistency algebra in order that their commutators close. We\nfind that equal-radii AdSp X Sq manifolds, for arbitrary p and q, admit\nconsistent propagation of massive and massless fields, with deformations that\ninclude no higher-derivative terms but are non-analytic in the curvature. We\nargue that analyticity of the deformations for a generic manifold may call for\nthe inclusion of mixed-symmetry tensor fields like in String Theory.\n", "  We propose a description of how a large, cold black hole (black zero-brane)\nin type IIA superstring theory evaporates into freely propagating D0-branes, by\nsolving the dual gauge theory quantitatively. The energy spectrum of emitted\nD0-branes is parametrically close to thermal when the black hole is large. The\nblack hole, while initially cold, gradually becomes an extremely hot and\nstringy object as it evaporates. As it emits D0-branes, its emission rate\nspeeds up and it evaporates completely without leaving any remnant. Hence this\nsystem provides us with a concrete holographic description of black hole\nevaporation without information loss.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied the energy spectra and B(E2) transition\nprobabilities of 124-130Ba isotopes in the shape phase transition region\nbetween the spherical and gamma unstable deformed shapes. We have used a\ntransitional Interacting Boson Model Hamiltonian which is based on affine\nSU(1,1) Lie Algebra in the both IBM-1 and 2 versions and also the Catastrophe\ntheory in combination with a coherent state formalism to generate energy\nsurfaces and determine the exact values of control parameters. Our results for\ncontrol parameters suggest a combination of U(5) and SO(6) dynamical symmetries\nin this isotopic chain. Also, the theoretical predictions can be rather well\nreproduce the experimental counterparts when the control parameter is\napproached to the SO(6) limit.\n", "  We test the effects of new diffeomorphism invariant boundary terms in\nSL(2,R)$\\times$SL(2,R) Chern-Simons theory. The gravitational interpretation\ncorresponds to free AdS$_3$ boundary conditions, without restrictions on the\nboundary geometry. The boundary theory is the theory of a string in a target\nAdS$_3$. Its Virasoro conditions can eliminate ghosts. Generalisations to\nSL(N,R)$\\times$SL(N,R) higher spin theories and many other questions are still\nunexplored.\n", "  We explore the space of scalar-tensor theories containing two\nnon-conformalmetrics, and find a discontinuity pointing to a \"critical\"\ncosmological solution. Due to the different maximal speeds of propagation for\nmatter and gravity,the cosmological fluctuations start off inside the horizon\neven without inflation, and will more naturally have a thermal origin (since\nthere is never vacuum domination). The critical model makes an unambiguous,\nnon-tuned prediction for the spectral index of the scalar fluctuations: $n_S=\n0.96478(64)$. Considering also that no gravitational waves are produced, we\nhave unveiled the most predictive model on offer. The model has a simple\ngeometrical interpretation as a probe 3-brane embedded in an $EAdS_2\\times E_3$\ngeometry.\n", "  Motivated by recently discovered quasi-one-dimensional superconductor\nK$_{2}$Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$ with $D_{3h}$ lattice symmetry, we study\none-dimensional three-orbital Hubbard model with generic electron repulsive\ninteraction described by intra-orbital repulsion $U$, inter-orbital repulsion,\nand Hund's coupling $J$. As extracted from density functional theory\ncalculation, two of the three atomic orbitals are degenerate ($E^{\\prime}$\nstates) and the third one is non-degenerate ($A^{\\prime}_1$), and the system is\npresumed to be at an incommensurate filling. With the help of bosonization, we\nhave usual three-band Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid for the normal state. Possible\ncharge density wave (CDW), spin density wave (SDW) and superconducting (SC)\ninstabilities are analyzed by renormalization group. The ground state depends\non the ratio $J/U$ and is sensitive to the degeneracy of $E^{\\prime}$ bands. At\n$0<J<U/3$, spin-singlet SC state is favored, while spin-triplet\nsuperconductivity will be favored in the region $U/3<J<U/2$. The SDW state has\nthe lowest energy only in the unphysical parameter region $J>U/2$. When the\ntwo-fold degeneracy of $E^{\\prime}$ bands is lifted, SDW instability has the\ntendency to dominate over the spin-singlet SC state at $0<J<U/3$, while the\norder parameter of the spin-triplet SC state will be modulated by a phase\nfactor $2\\Delta k_F x$ at $U/3<J<U/2$. Possible experimental consequences and\napplications to K$_{2}$Cr$_{3}$As$_{3}$ are discussed.\n", "  This paper establishes the long time asymptotic limit of the three\ndimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation with strong external magnetic field. The\nguiding center approximation is investigated in the three dimensional case with\na non-constant magnetic field. In the long time asymptotic limit, the motion\ncan be split in two parts : one stationary flow along the lines of the magnetic\nfield and the guiding center motion in the orthogonal plane of the magnetic\nfield where classical drift velocities are recovered. We discuss in particular\nthe effect of nonconstant external magnetic fields.\n", "  Floquet theory provides rigorous foundations for the theory of periodically\ndriven quantum systems. In the case of non-periodic driving, however, the\nsituation is not so well understood. Here, we provide a critical review of the\ntheoretical framework developed for quasi-periodically driven quantum systems.\nAlthough the theoretical footing is still under development, we argue that\nquasi-periodically driven quantum systems can be treated with generalizations\nof Floquet theory in suitable parameter regimes. Moreover, we provide a\ngeneralization of the Floquet-Magnus expansion and argue that quasi-periodic\ndriving offers a promising route for quantum simulations.\n", "  We present a complete classification of quantum stabilizer gates in terms of\nthe functions they generate assuming the ability to swap qubits and use\nancillary workspace. Because we view these stabilizer circuits as subroutines\nof some general quantum computation, we insist that any ancilla qubits used\nduring the computation must not change in an input-dependent manner. This is\nthe first attempt at a quantum extension of the classification of reversible\nclassical gates introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious\nprogram to classify all quantum gate sets.\n  The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau\nrepresentation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which\nelementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57\ndifferent stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the\nsingle-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining\nclasses are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the\nCNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to\nX-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining\nclasses are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the\nT_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates.\n", "  Ghost imaging (GI) lidar, as a novel remote sensing technique,has been\nreceiving increasing interest in recent years. By combining pulse-compression\ntechnique and coherent detection with GI, we propose a new lidar system called\npulse-compression GI lidar. Our analytical results, which are backed up by\nnumerical simulations, demonstrate that pulse-compression GI lidar can obtain\nthe target's spatial intensity distribution, range and moving velocity.\nCompared with conventional pulsed GI lidar system, pulse-compression GI lidar,\nwithout decreasing the range resolution, is easy to obtain high single pulse\nenergy with the use of a long pulse, and the mechanism of coherent detection\ncan eliminate the influence of the stray light, which can dramatically improve\nthe detection sensitivity and detection range.\n", "  We review various off-shell formulations for interacting higher-spin systems\nin dimensions 3 and 4. Associated with higher-spin systems in spacetime\ndimension 4 is a Chern-Simons action for a superconnection taking its values in\na direct product of an infinite-dimensional algebra of oscillators and a\nFrobenius algebra. A crucial ingredient of the model is that it elevates the\nrigid closed and central two-form of Vasiliev's theory to a dynamical 2-form\nand doubles the higher-spin algebra, thereby considerably reducing the number\nof possible higher spin invariants and giving a nonzero effective functional\non-shell. The two action principles we give for higher-spin systems in 3D are\nbased on Chern-Simons and BF models. In the first case, the theory we give\nunifies higher-spin gauge fields with fractional-spin fields and an internal\nsector. In particular, Newton's constant is related to the coupling constant of\nthe internal sector. In the second case, the BF action we review gives the\nfully nonlinear Prokushkin-Vasiliev, bosonic equations for matter-coupled\nhigher spins in 3D. We present the truncation to a single, real matter field\nrelevant in the Gaberdiel-Gopakumar holographic duality. The link between the\nvarious actions we present is the fact that they all borrow ingredients from\nTopological Field Theory. It has bee conjectured that there is an underlying\nand unifying 2-dimensional first-quantised description of the previous\nhigher-spin models in 3D and 4D, in the form of a Cattaneo-Felder-like\ntopological action containing fermionic fields.\n", "  Direct laser acceleration of electrons in ion channels is investigated in a\ngeneral case when the laser phase velocity is greater than (or equal to) the\nspeed of light. Using the similarity of the equations of motion for\nultra-relativistic electrons, we develop a universal scaling theory that gives\nthe maximum possible energy that can be attained by an electron for given laser\nand plasma parameters. The theory predicts appearance of forbidden zones in the\nphase space of the particle, which manifests itself as an energy gain\nthreshold. We apply the developed theory to find the conditions needed for an\nenergy enhancement via a resonant interaction between the third harmonic of\nbetatron oscillations and the laser wave. The theory is also used to analyze\nelectron dynamics in a circularly polarized laser.\n", "  In this work, we estimate the masses of tetraquark states with four different\nflavors by virtue of QCD sum rules, in both $b$ and $c$ sectors. We construct\nfour $[8_c]_{\\bar{b} s} \\otimes [8_c]_{\\bar{d} u}$ tetraquark currents with\n$J^P = 0^+$, and then perform analytic calculation up to dimension eight in the\nOperator Product Expansion (OPE). We keep terms which are linear in the strange\nquark mass $m_s$, and in the end find two possible tetraquark states with\nmasses $(5.57 \\pm 0.15)$ and $(5.58 \\pm 0.15)$ GeV. We find that their\ncharmed-partner masses lie in $(2.54 \\pm 0.13)$ and $(2.55 \\pm 0.13)$ GeV,\nrespectively and are hence accessible in experiments like BESIII and Belle.\n", "  We investigate a hybrid quantum system consisting of spatially separated\nresonant exchange qubits, defined in three-electron semiconductor triple\nquantum dots, that are coupled via a superconducting transmission line\nresonator. Drawing on methods from circuit quantum electrodynamics and\nHartmann-Hahn double resonance techniques, we analyze three specific approaches\nfor implementing resonator-mediated two-qubit entangling gates in both\ndispersive and resonant regimes of interaction. We calculate entangling gate\nfidelities as well as the rate of relaxation via phonons for resonant exchange\nqubits in silicon triple dots and show that such an implementation is\nparticularly well-suited to achieving the strong coupling regime. Our approach\ncombines the favorable coherence properties of encoded spin qubits in silicon\nwith the rapid and robust long-range entanglement provided by circuit QED\nsystems.\n", "  We present an analysis of the iron abundance in the hot gas surrounding\ngalaxy groups and clusters. To do this, we first compile and homogenise a large\ndataset of 79 low-redshift (|z| = 0.03) systems (159 individual measurements)\nfrom the literature. Our analysis accounts for differences in aperture size,\nsolar abundance, and cosmology, and scales all measurements using customised\nradial profiles for the temperature (T), gas density, and iron abundance (Z).\nWe then compare this dataset to groups and clusters in the L-Galaxies galaxy\nevolution model.\n  Our homogenised dataset reveals a tight T-Z relation for clusters, with a\nscatter in Z of only 0.10 dex and a slight negative gradient. After examining\npotential measurement biases, we conclude that at least some of this negative\ngradient has a physical origin. Our model suggests greater accretion of\nhydrogen in the hottest systems, via stripping of gas from infalling\nsatellites, as a cause. At lower temperatures, L-Galaxies over-estimates Z in\ngroups, indicating that metal-rich gas removal (via e.g. AGN feedback) is\nrequired.\n  L-Galaxies provides a reasonable match to the observed Z in the intracluster\nmedium (ICM) of the hottest clusters from at least z ~ 1.3 to 0.3. This is\nachieved without needing to modify any of the galactic chemical evolution (GCE)\nmodel parameters. However, the Z in intermediate-temperature clusters appears\nto be under-estimated in our model at z = 0. The merits and problems with\nmodifying the GCE modelling to correct this are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the ab-initio homogenization of separable metamaterials with\nfactorized dielectric permittivity profile which can be achieved through\nsuitable grey-scale permittivity design techniques. Separability allows such\nmetamaterials to be physically regarded as the superposition of three\nfictitious 1D generating media. We prove that, in the long-wavelength limit,\nseparable metamaterials admit simple and analytical description of their\nelectromagnetic bi-anisotropic response which can be reconstructed from the\nproperties of the 1D generating media. Our approach provides a strategy which\nallows the full ab-initio and flexible design of a complex bianisotropic\nresponse by using 1D metamaterials as basic building blocks.\n", "  Information processing with light is ubiquitous, from communication,\nmetrology and imaging to computing. When we consider light as a quantum\nmechanical object, new ways of information processing become possible. In this\nreview I give an overview how quantum information processing can be implemented\nwith single photons, and what hurdles still need to be overcome to implement\nthe various applications in practice. I will place special emphasis on the\nquantum mechanical properties of light that make it different from classical\nlight, and how these properties relate to quantum information processing tasks.\n", "  The power spectrum of a stationary process may be calculated in terms of the\nautocorrelation function using the Wiener-Khinchin theorem. We here generalize\nthe Wiener-Khinchin theorem for nonstationary processes and introduce a\ntime-dependent power spectrum $\\left\\langle S_{t_m}(\\omega)\\right\\rangle$ where\n$t_m$ is the measurement time. For processes with an aging correlation function\nof the form $\\left\\langle I(t)I(t+\\tau)\\right\\rangle=t^{\\Upsilon}\\phi_{\\rm\nEA}(\\tau/t)$, where $\\phi_{\\rm EA}(x)$ is a nonanalytic function when $x$ is\nsmall, we find aging $1/f$ noise. Aging $1/f$ noise is characterized by five\ncritical exponents. We derive the relations between the scaled correlation\nfunction and these exponents. We show that our definition of the time-dependent\nspectrum retains its interpretation as a density of Fourier modes and discuss\nthe relation to the apparent infrared divergence of $1/f$ noise. We illustrate\nour results for blinking quantum dot models, single-file diffusion and Brownian\nmotion in logarithmic potential.\n", "  We consider the determination of the finite temperature phase transition in\nthe Yang--Mills SU(3) gauge theory. We compute the difference of the spatial\nand temporal energy density at a physical Wilson flow time. This difference is\nzero in the confined phase and becomes non zero in the deconfined phase. We\nlocate the phase transition by using a new technique based on an exponential\nsmoothing spline. This method is an alternative to the determination of the\nphase transition based on the Polyakov loop susceptibility and can also be used\nwith dynamical fermions.\n", "  We consider a mechanical resonator made of diamond, which contains a\nnitrogen-vacancy center (NV center) locating at the end of the oscillator. A\nsecond order magnetic gradient is applied and inducing coupling between\nmechanical modes and the NV center. By applying proper external magnetic field,\nthe energy difference between NV center electron spin levels can be tuned to\nmatch the energy difference between two mechanical modes $a$ and $b$. A laser\nis used for continuously initializing the NV center electron spin. The mode $a$\nwith lower frequency is driven by a thermal bath. We find that the temperature\nof the mode $b$ is significantly cooled when the heating bath temperature is\nincreased. We discuss the conditions that quantum regime cooling requires, and\nconfirm the results by numerical simulation. Finally we give the intuitive\nphysical explanation on this unusual effect.\n", "  We show that the spectrum of normalizable states on a Euclidean SL(2,R)/U(1)\nblack hole exhibits a duality between oscillator states and wound strings. This\nduality generalizes the FZZ correspondence, which can be thought of as an\nidentification between a normalizable mode of dilaton gravity and a mode of the\ntachyon with winding number one around the Euclidean time circle. It implies\nthat normalizable states on a large Euclidean black hole have support at widely\nseparated scales. In particular, localized states that are extended over the\ncap of the cigar (the Euclidian analog of the black hole atmosphere) have a\ncomponent that is localized near the tip of the cigar (the analog of the\nstretched horizon). As a consequence of this duality, the states exhibit a\ntransition as a function of radial excitation level. From the perspective of a\nlow energy probe, low lying states are naturally thought of as oscillator\nstates in the black hole atmosphere, while at large excitation level they are\nnaturally described as wound strings. As the excitation level increases, the\nsize of the states first decreases and then increases. This behavior is\nexpected to be a general feature of black hole horizons in string theory.\n", "  We propose a method to create higher orbital states of ultracold atoms in the\nMott regime of an optical lattice. This is done by periodically modulating the\nposition of the trap minima (known as shaking) and controlling the interference\nterm of the lasers creating the lattice. These methods are combined with\ntechniques of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As an example of this, we show\nspecifically how to create an anti-ferromagnetic type ordering of angular\nmomentum states of atoms. The specific pulse sequences are designed using\nLewis-Riesenfeld invariants and a four-level model for each well. The results\nare compared with numerical simulations of the full Schroedinger equation.\n", "  Dipolaritons are quasiparticles that arise in coupled quantum wells embedded\nin a microcavity, they are a superposition of a photon, a direct exciton and an\nindirect exciton. We propose the existence of dipolaritons in a system of two\ncoupled quantum dots inside a microcavity in direct analogy with the quantum\nwell case and find that, despite some similarities, dipolaritons in quantum\ndots have different properties and can lead to true dark polariton states. We\nuse a finite system theory to study the effects of the magnetic field on the\nsystem, including the emission, and find that it can be used as a control\nparameter of the properties of excitons and dipolaritons, and the overall\nmagnetic behaviour of the structure.\n", "  We study a simple model of a foraging animal that modifies the substrate on\nwhich it moves. This substrate provides its only resource, and the forager\nmanage it by taking a limited portion at each visited site. The resource\nrecovers its value after the visit following a relaxation law. We study\ndifferent scenarios to analyze the efficiency of the managing strategy,\ncorresponding to control the bite size. We observe the non trivial emergence of\na home range, that is visited in a periodic way. The duration of the\ncorresponding cycles and the transient until it emerges is affected by the bite\nsize. Our results show that the most efficient use of the resource, measured as\nthe balance between gathering and travelled distance, corresponds to foragers\nthat take larger portions but without exhausting the resource. We also analyze\nthe use of space determining the number of attractors of the dynamics, and we\nobserve that it depends on the bite size and the recovery time of the resource.\n", "  We compute masses of $D$ meson, $D_s$ meson and charmonium states using\n$N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. All results are extrapolated to\nphysical light quark masses, physical strange and charm quark masses and to the\ncontinuum. Our analysis includes states with spin $J = 0,1,2$, parity\n$\\mathcal{P} = -,+$ and in case of charmonium also charge conjugation\n$\\mathcal{C} = -,+$. Computations are based on a large set of quark-antiquark\nmeson creation operators. We investigate and quantify all sources of systematic\nerrors, including fitting range uncertainties, finite volume effects, isospin\nbreaking effects and the choice of the fitting ansatz for the combined chiral\nand continuum extrapolation such that the resulting meson masses can be\ncompared directly and in a meaningful way to experimental results. Within\ncombined statistical and systematic errors, which are between below two per\nmille and three percent, our results agree with available experimental results\nfor most of the states. In the few cases where we observe discrepancies, we\ndiscuss possible reasons.\n", "  We find new exact relations between the partition function and vacuum\nexpectation values (VEVs) of 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in ABJ theory, which allow us\nto predict the large N expansions of the 1/2 BPS Wilson loops from known\nresults of the partition function. These relations are interpreted as an\nopen-closed duality where the closed string background is shifted by the\ninsertion of Wilson loops due to a back-reaction. Using the connection between\nABJ theory and the topological string on local P1 x P1, we explicitly write\ndown non-trivial relations between open and closed string amplitudes.\n", "  We provide a detailed study of the interface Trap Assisted Tunneling (TAT)\nmechanism in tunnel field effect transistors to show how it contributes a major\nleakage current path before the Band To Band Tunneling (BTBT) is initiated.\nWith a modified Shockley-Read-Hall formalism, we show that at room temperature,\nthe phonon assisted TAT current always dominates and obscures the steep turn ON\nof the BTBT current for common densities of traps. Our results are applicable\nto top gate, double gate and gate all around structures where the traps are\npositioned between the source-channel tunneling region. Since the TAT has\nstrong dependence on electric field, any effort to increase the BTBT current by\nenhancing local electric field also increases the leakage current. Unless the\nBTBT current can be increased separately, calculations show that the trap\ndensity Dit has to be decreased by 40-100 times compared with the state of the\nart in order for the steep turn ON (for III-V materials) to be clearly\nobservable at room temperature. We find that the combination of the intrinsic\nsharpness of the band edges (Urbach tail) and the surface trap density\ndetermines the subthreshold swing.\n", "  We study the possible reach of the proposed International Linear Collider\n(ILC) in exploring the lepton flavor violating (LFV) Higgs boson decay\n$h\\to\\mu\\tau$. Two generic types of models are investigated, both involving an\nextended scalar sector. For the first type, the rest of the scalars are heavy\nand beyond the reach of ILC but the LFV decay occurs through a tiny admixture\nof the Standard Model (SM) doublet with the heavy degrees of freedom. In the\nsecond class, which is more constrained from the existing data, the SM Higgs\nboson does not have any LFV decay but there are other scalars degenerate with\nit that gives rise to the LFV signal. We show that ILC can pin down the\nbranching fraction of $h\\to\\mu\\tau$, and hence the effective LFV Yukawa\ncoupling, to a very small value, due to the fact that there are signal channels\nwith unlike flavor leptons but no missing energy. It turns out that the\nlow-energy options of the ILC, namely, $\\sqrt{s}=250$ or 500 GeV are better to\ninvestigate such channels, and the option of beam polarization helps too. At\nleast an order of magnitude improvement is envisaged over the existing limits.\n", "  We develop an approach to construct local bulk operators in a CFT to order\n$1/N^2$. Since 4-point functions are not fixed by conformal invariance we use\nthe OPE to categorize possible forms for a bulk operator. Using previous\nresults on 3-point functions we construct a local bulk operator in each OPE\nchannel. We then impose the condition that the bulk operators constructed in\ndifferent channels agree, and hence give rise to a well-defined bulk operator.\nWe refer to this condition as the \"bulk bootstrap.\" We argue and explicitly\nshow in some examples that the bulk bootstrap leads to some of the same results\nas the regular conformal bootstrap. In fact the bulk bootstrap provides an\neasier way to determine some CFT data, since it does not require knowing the\nform of the conformal blocks. This analysis clarifies previous results on the\nrelation between bulk locality and the bootstrap for theories with a $1/N$\nexpansion, and it identifies a simple and direct way in which OPE coefficients\nand anomalous dimensions determine the bulk equations of motion to order\n$1/N^2$.\n", "  Motivated by the diphoton excess at 750 GeV reported by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments, we present an F-theory inspired flipped $SO(10)$ model embedded in\nan $E_6$ GUT. The low energy spectrum includes the three MSSM chiral families,\nvectorlike color triplets, several pairs of charged $SU(2)_L$ singlet fields\n$(E^c, \\bar E^c)$, as well as MSSM singlets, one or more of which can\ncontribute to the resonance. Total decay width in the multi-GeV range can arise\nfrom couplings involving the singlet and MSSM fields\n", "  Layered thallium copper chalcogenides can form single, double, or triple\nlayers of Cu-Ch separated by Tl sheets. Here we report on the preparation and\nproperties of Tl-based materials of TlCu2Se2, TlCu4S3, TlCu4Se3 and TlCu6S4,\nand compare to reports on layered ACu2nChn+1 materials with A = Ba, K, Rb, and\nCs, and Ch = S, Se. Having no long-range magnetism for these materials is quite\nsurprising considering the possibilities of inter- and intra-layer exchange\ninteractions through Cu 3d, and we measure by magnetic susceptibility and\nconfirm by neutron diffraction. First principles density-functional theory\ncalculations for both the single-layer TlCu2Se2 (isostructural to the 122\niron-based superconductors) and the double-layer TlCu4Se3 suggest a lack of\nFermi-level spectral weight that is needed to drive a magnetic or\nsuperconducting instability. The electronic structure calculations show a much\ngreater likelihood of magnetism for multiple structural layers with Fe.\n", "  We show that critical Casimir effects can be accessed through direct\nsimulation of a model binary fluid passing through the demixing transition. We\nwork in the semi grand canonical ensemble, in slab geometry, in which the\nCasimir force appears as the excess of the generalized pressure,\n$P_{\\bot}-n\\mu$. The excesses of the perpendicular pressure, $P_{\\bot}$, and of\n$n\\mu$, are individually of much larger amplitude. A critical pressure\nanisotropy is observed between forces parallel and perpendicular to the\nconfinement direction, which collapses onto a universal scaling function\nclosely related to that of the critical Casimir force.\n", "  We investigate black hole-host galaxy scaling relations in cosmological\nsimulations with a self-consistent black hole growth and feedback model. The\nsub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum\ntransport from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic\nfeedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties\nchosen to match observed nuclear outflows. We show that \"quasar mode\" feedback\ncan have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium\nand the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback\nefficiencies as low as 0.1% relative to the bolometric luminosity. Nonetheless,\nour simulations suggest that the black hole-host scaling relations are only\nweakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales,\nowing to feedback suppressing the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by\na similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the\ncentral black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the\nslope and normalization of the black hole-host correlations. Our results\nsuggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the\nprimary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we\nprobe the electronic and magnetic properties of X$_{2}$PtGa (X being Cr, Mn,\nFe, Co) Heusler alloys. Our calculations predict that all these systems possess\ninverse Heusler alloy structure in their respective ground states. Application\nof tetragonal distortion leads to lowering of energy with respect to the cubic\nphase for all the materials. The equilibrium volumes of both the phases are\nnearly the same. These results of our calculations indicate that all these\nmaterials are prone to undergo martensite transition, as has been recently\nshown theoretically for Mn$_{2}$PtGa in the literature. Ground state with a\ntetragonal symmetry of these materials is supported by the observation of soft\ntetragonal shear constants in their cubic phase. By comparing the energies of\nvarious types of magnetic configurations of these alloys we predict that\nCr$_{2}$PtGa and Mn$_{2}$PtGa possess ferrimagnetic configuration whereas\nFe$_{2}$PtGa and Co$_{2}$PtGa possess ferromagneic configuration in their\nrespective ground states.\n", "  We introduce several families of $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ UV boundary conditions\nin 3d $\\mathcal N=4$ gauge theories and study their IR images in sigma-models\nto the Higgs and Coulomb branches. In the presence of Omega deformations, a UV\nboundary condition defines a pair of modules for quantized algebras of chiral\nHiggs- and Coulomb-branch operators, respectively, whose structure we derive.\nIn the case of abelian theories, we use the formalism of hyperplane\narrangements to make our constructions very explicit, and construct a half-BPS\ninterface that implements the action of 3d mirror symmetry on gauge theories\nand boundary conditions. Finally, by studying two-dimensional compactifications\nof 3d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories and their boundary conditions, we propose\na physical origin for symplectic duality - an equivalence of categories of\nmodules associated to families of Higgs and Coulomb branches that has recently\nappeared in the mathematics literature, and generalizes classic results on\nKoszul duality in geometric representation theory. We make several predictions\nabout the structure of symplectic duality, and identify Koszul duality as a\nspecial case of wall crossing.\n", "  The swimming of a spheroid immersed in a viscous fluid and performing surface\ndeformations periodically in time is studied on the basis of Stokes equations\nof low Reynolds number hydrodynamics. The average over a period of time of the\nswimming velocity and the rate of dissipation are given by integral expressions\nof second order in the amplitude of surface deformations. The first order flow\nvelocity and pressure, as functions of spheroidal coordinates, are expressed as\nsums of basic solutions of Stokes equations. Sets of superposition coefficients\nof these solutions which optimize the mean swimming speed for given power are\nderived from an eigenvalue problem. The maximum eigenvalue is a measure of the\nefficiency of the optimal stroke within the chosen class of motions. The\nmaximum eigenvalue for sets of low order is found to be a strongly increasing\nfunction of the aspect ratio of the spheroid.\n", "  ATLAS LAr calorimeter will perform its Phase-I upgrade during the long shut\ndown (LS2) in 2018, a new LAr Trigger Digitizer Board (LTDB) will be designed\nand installed. Several commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) multichannel high-speed\nADCs have been selected as possible backups of the radiation tolerant ADC ASICs\nfor LTDB. In order to evaluate the radiation tolerance of these back up\ncommercial ADCs, we developed an ADC radiation tolerance characterization\nsystem, which includes the ADC boards, data acquisition (DAQ) board, signal\ngenerator, external power supplies and a host computer. The ADC board is custom\ndesigned for different ADCs, which has ADC driver and clock distribution\ncircuits integrated on board. The Xilinx ZC706 FPGA development board is used\nas DAQ board. The data from ADC are routed to the FPGA through the FMC (FPGA\nMezzanine Card) connector, de-serialized and monitored by the FPGA, and then\ntransmitted to the host computer through the Gigabit Ethernet. A software\nprogram has been developed with Python, and all the commands are sent to the\nDAQ board through Gigabit Ethernet by this program. Two ADC boards have been\ndesigned for the TI ADS52J90 and ADI AD9249 respectively. TID test of both ADCs\nhave been performed at BNL, and SEE test for ADS52J90 has been performed at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Test results have been analyzed and\npresented. The test results demonstrate that our test system is very versatile,\nand working well for the radiation tolerance characterization of commercial\nmulti-channel high-speed ADC for the upgrade of the ATLAS LAr calorimeter. It\nis applicable to other collider physics experiments where radiation tolerance\nis required as well.\n", "  We discuss our recent work [4] in which gravitational radiation was studied\nby evaluating the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass of surfaces of fixed size at the\ninfinity of both axial and polar perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime,\n\\`{a} la Chandrasekhar [1].\n", "  The cornerstone of the Chinese experimental particle physics program consists\nof a series of experiments performed in the tau-charm energy region. China\nbegan building e+e- colliders at the Institute for High Energy Physics in\nBeijing more than three decades ago. Beijing Electron Spectrometer, BES, is the\ncommon root name for the particle physics detectors operated at these machines.\nThe development of the BES program is summarized and highlights of the physics\nresults across several topical areas are presented.\n", "  We prove Buslaev-Faddeev trace identities for the matrix Schr\\\"odinger\noperator on the half line, with general boundary conditions at the origin, and\nwith selfadjoint matrix potentials.\n", "  Recently, the bi-local fields attract the interest in studying the duality\nbetween $O(N)$ vector model and a higher-spin gauge theory in AdS spacetime. In\nthose theories, the bi-local fields are realized as collective one's of the\n$O(N)$ vector fields, which are the source of higher-spin bulk fields.\nHistorically, the bi-local fields are introduced as a candidate of non-local\nfields by Yukawa. Today, Yukawa's bi-local fields are understood from a\nviewpoint of relativistic two-particle bound systems, the bi-local systems. We\nstudy the relation between the bi-local collective fields out of higher-spin\nbulk fields and the fields out of the bi-local systems embedded in AdS${}_5$\nspacetime with warped metric. It is shown that the effective spring constant of\nthe bi-local system depends on the brane, on which the bi-local system is\nlocated. In particular, a bi-local system with vanishing spring constant, which\nis similar to the bi-local collective fields, can be realized on a low-energy\nIR brane.\n", "  The completion of Run 1 of the CERN Large Hadron Collider has seen the\ndiscovery of the Higgs boson and an unprecedented number of precise\nmeasurements of the Standard Model, while Run 2 operation has just started to\nprovide first data at higher energy. Upgrades of the LHC to high luminosity\n(HL-LHC) and the experiments (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) will exploit the full\npotential of the collider to discover and explore new physics beyond the\nStandard Model. In this article, the experimental challenges and the physics\nopportunities in proton-proton collisions at the HL-LHC are reviewed.\n", "  Using the multiple-scale homogenization method, we derive generalized sheet\ntransition conditions (GSTCs) for electromagnetic fields at the surface of a\nmetafilm. The scatterers that compose the metafilm are of arbitrary shape and\nare embedded between two different magneto-dielectric media. The parameters in\nthese boundary conditions are interpreted as effective electric and magnetic\nsurface susceptibilities, which themselves are related to the geometry of the\nscatterers that constitute the metafilm.\n", "  The indirect detection of dark matter annihilation and decay using\nobservations of photons, charged cosmic rays, and neutrinos offers a promising\nmeans of identifying the particle nature of this elusive component of the\nuniverse. The last decade has seen substantial advances in observational data\nsets, complemented by new insights from numerical simulations, which together\nhave enabled for the first time strong constraints on dark matter particle\nmodels, and have revealed several intriguing hints of possible signals. This\nreview provides an introduction to indirect detection methods and an overview\nof recent results in the field.\n", "  We consider co-rotational wave maps from Minkowski space in $d+1$ dimensions\nto the $d$-sphere. Recently, Bizo\\'n and Biernat found explicit self-similar\nsolutions for each dimension $d\\geq 4$. We give a rigorous proof for the mode\nstability of these self-similar wave maps.\n", "  We review recent developments in the ab-initio theoretical description of the\ninitial state in heavy-ion collisions. We emphasize the importance of\nfluctuations, both for the phenomenological description of experimental data\nfrom the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC), and the theoretical understanding of the non-equilibrium early time\ndynamics and thermalization of the medium.\n", "  In the present article, we have constructed static anisotropic compact star\nmodels of Einstein field equations for the spherical symmetric metric of\nembedding class one. By assuming the particular form of metric function $\\nu$,\nWe have solved the Einstein field equations for anisotropic matter\ndistribution. The anisotropic models are representing the realistic compact\nobjects such as SAX J 1808.4-3658 (SS1), Her X - 1, Vela X-12, PSR J1614-2230\nand Cen X - 3. We have reported our results in details for compact star Her X-1\non the ground of physical properties such as pressure, density, velocity of\nsound, energy conditions, TOV equation and red-shift etc. Along with these, we\nhave also discussed about stability of the compact star models. Finally we made\nthe comparison between our anisotropic stars with the realistic objects on the\nkey aspects as central density, central pressure, compactness and surface\nred-shift.\n", "  We report on a search for radio transients at 340 MHz with the Jansky Very\nLarge Array (VLA) Low band Ionospheric and Transient Experiment (VLITE).\nBetween 2015 July 29 and 2015 September 27, operating in commensal mode, VLITE\nimaged approximately 2800 pointings covering 12,000 deg$^2$ on the sky,\nsampling timescales ranging from tens of seconds to several hours on a daily\nbasis. In addition, between 2015 February 25 and 2015 May 9, VLITE observed 55\nepochs of roughly 2-4 hours each toward the COSMOS field. Using existing radio\nsource catalogs we have searched all the daily VLITE images for transients,\nwhile for the COSMOS field we compared individual images and the summed image\nto search for new sources in repeated observations of the same field. The wide\nrange of timescales makes VLITE sensitive to both coherent and incoherent\ntransient source classes. No new transients are found, allowing us to set\nstringent upper limits on transients at milliJansky levels and at low\nfrequencies where comparatively few such surveys have been carried out to date.\nAn all-sky isotropic rate of bursting radio transients with similar rates,\nduration, and intensity as the unusual transient GCRT J1745$-$3009, discovered\nin wide-field monitoring toward the Galactic center, is ruled out with high\nconfidence. The resulting non-detections allows us to argue that this is a\ncoherent source, whose properties most resemble the growing class of nulling\npulsars. We end with a discussion of the future prospects for the detection of\ntransients by VLITE and other experiments.\n", "  A decade ago, the first leptogenesis model based on inflation was proposed,\nwhere the complex phase of the inflaton field carries lepton number. If the\ninflaton field is an axion, it can couple to gravitational waves and gauge\nfields via. Chern-Simons invariants. Due to these couplings, birefringent\ngravitational and gauge primordial perturbations are created during inflation\nto generate a lepton asymmetry, establishing a possible connection between\nnon-vanishing TB-parity violating polarization cross-correlations and\nleptogenesis. We also discuss the prospect for a subset of these models can\ndirectly source circular (V-mode) polarization in the CMB.\n", "  Large scale atomistic simulations with suitable interatomic potentials are\nwidely employed by scientists or engineers of different areas. Quick generation\nof high-quality interatomic potentials is of urgent need under present\ncircumstances, which largely relies on the developments of potential\nconstruction methods and algorithms in this area. Quantities of interatomic\npotential models have been proposed and parameterized with various methods,\nsuch as analytic method, force-matching approach and multi-object optimization\nmethod, in order to make the potentials more transferable. Without apparently\nlowing precisions for describing the target system, potentials of fewer fitting\nparameters (FPs) are somewhat more physically reasonable. Thus, studying\nmethods of reducing FP number is helpful to understand the underline physics of\nsimulated systems and generalize the construction methods to other similar\nsystems. However, few reported works concentrate on methods of reducing the\nnumber of FPs without affecting precisions. In this work, the methods of\nreducing the FP number while keeping the precisions are discussed from two\naspects. Firstly, the physical ideas of constructions of the embedded-atom\nmethod (EAM) potential model are modified to make the potential more robust,\nflexible and scalable without introducing too many FPs.Secondly, the smaller\nreference data set (SRD), compared with the target reference database for\ndescribing the mechanical behaviors of aluminum, is employed in our\nconstruction procedures.\n", "  We consider the possibility of creating a graviton laser. The lasing medium\nwould be a system of contained, ultra cold neutrons. Ultra cold neutrons are a\nquantum mechanical system that interacts with gravitational fields and with the\nphonons of the container walls. It is possible to create a population inversion\nby pumping the system using the phonons. We compute the rate of spontaneous\nemission of gravitons and the rate of the subsequent stimulated emission of\ngravitons. The gain obtainable is directly proportional to the density of the\nlasing medium and the fraction of the population inversion. The applications of\na graviton laser would be interesting.\n", "  The ALICE experiment explores the properties of strongly interacting QCD\nmatter at extremely high temperatures created in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC and\nprovides further insight into small-system physics in (high-multiplicity) pp\nand p-Pb collisions. The ALICE collaboration presented 27 parallel talks, 50\nposters, and 1 flash talk at Quark Matter 2015 and covered various topics\nincluding collective dynamics, correlations and fluctuations, heavy flavors,\nquarkonia, jets and high $p_{\\rm T}$ hadrons, electromagnetic probes, small\nsystem physics, and the upgrade program. This paper highlights some of the\nselected results.\n", "  Quarkonium production in heavy-ion collisions is a well-known signature of\nthe formation of a plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP). After thirty years from\nthe first measurements at SPS energies, a large wealth of results is now\naccessible from high-energy experiments at RHIC and LHC, and these new data are\ncontributing to sharpen the picture of the quarkonium behaviour in A-A\ncollisions. In this paper, an overview of the main results on both charmonium\nand bottomonium production in p-A and A-A collisions is presented, focussing on\nthe most recent achievements from the RHIC and LHC experiments.\n", "  Coherent backscattering is a coherence effect in the propagation of waves\nthrough disordered media involving two or more scattering events. Here, we\nreport on the observation of coherent backscattering from individual atoms and\ntheir mirror images. This system displays two important advantages: First, the\neffect can be observed at low optical densities, which allows to work in very\ndilute clouds or far from resonance. Second, due to the fact that the radiation\nof an atom interferes constructively with that of its own image, the phenomenon\nis much more robust to dephasing induced by strong saturation. In particular,\nthe contribution of inelastically scattered photons to the interference process\nis demonstrated.\n", "  Manipulation of the magnetization by external energies other than magnetic\nfield, such as spin-polarized current1-4, electric voltage5,6 and circularly\npolarized light7-11 gives a paradigm shift in magnetic nanodevices.\nMagnetization control of ferromagnetic materials only by circularly polarized\nlight has received increasing attention both as a fundamental probe of the\ninteractions of light and magnetism but also for future high-density magnetic\nrecording technologies. Here we show that for granular FePt films, designed for\nultrahigh-density recording, the optical magnetic switching by circularly\npolarized light is an accumulative effect from multiple optical pulses. We\nfurther show that deterministic switching of high anisotropy materials by the\ncombination of circularly polarized light and modest external magnetic fields,\nthus revealing a pathway towards technological implementation.\n", "  The EPW (Electron-Phonon coupling using Wannier functions) software is a\nFortran90 code that uses density-functional perturbation theory and maximally\nlocalized Wannier functions for computing electron-phonon couplings and related\nproperties in solids accurately and efficiently. The EPW v4 program can be used\nto compute electron and phonon self-energies, linewidths, electron-phonon\nscattering rates, electron-phonon coupling strengths, transport spectral\nfunctions, electronic velocities, resistivity, anisotropic superconducting gaps\nand spectral functions within the Migdal-Eliashberg theory. The code now\nsupports spin-orbit coupling, time-reversal symmetry in non-centrosymmetric\ncrystals, polar materials, and $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$-point\nparallelization. Considerable effort was dedicated to optimization and\nparallelization, achieving almost a ten times speedup with respect to previous\nreleases. A computer test farm was implemented to ensure stability and\nportability of the code on the most popular compilers and architectures. Since\nApril 2016, version 4 of the EPW code is fully integrated in and distributed\nwith the Quantum ESPRESSO package, and can be downloaded through QE-forge at\nhttp://qe-forge.org/gf/project/q-e.\n", "  A computational framework is developed to address capillary self-focusing in\nStep Emulsification. The microfluidic system consists of a single shallow and\nwide microchannel that merges into a deep reservoir. A continuum approach\ncoupled with a volume of fluid method is used to model the capillary\nself-focusing effect. The original governing equations are reduced using the\nHele-Shaw approximation. We show that the interface between the two fluids\ntakes the shape of a neck narrowing in the flow direction just before entering\nthe reservoir, in agreement with our experimental observations. Our\ncomputational model relies on the assumption that the pressure at the boundary,\nwhere the fluid exits into the reservoir, is the uniform pressure in the\nreservoir. We investigate this hypothesis by comparing the numerical results\nwith experimental data. We conjecture that the pressure boundary condition\nbecomes important when the width of the neck is comparable to the depth of the\nmicrochannel. A correction to the exit pressure boundary condition is then\nproposed, which is determined by comparison with experimental data. We also\npresent the experimental observations and the numerical results of the\ntransitions of breakup regimes.\n", "  We develop analytical methods for computing the structure constant for three\nheavy operators, starting from the recently proposed hexagon approach. Such a\nstructure constant is a semiclassical object, with the scale set by the inverse\nlength of the operators playing the role of the Planck constant. We reformulate\nthe hexagon expansion in terms of multiple contour integrals and recast it as a\nsum over clusters generated by the residues of the measure of integration. We\ntest the method on two examples. First, we compute the asymptotic three-point\nfunction of heavy fields at any coupling and show the result in the\nsemiclassical limit matches both the string theory computation at strong\ncoupling and the tree-level results obtained before. Second, in the case of one\nnon-BPS and two BPS operators at strong coupling we sum up all wrapping\ncorrections associated with the opposite bridge to the non-trivial operator, or\nthe \"bottom\" mirror channel. We also give an alternative interpretation of the\nresults in terms of a gas of fermions and show that they can be expressed\ncompactly as an operator-valued super-determinant.\n", "  The fundamental shear horizontal (SH0) wave in plate-like structures is of\ngreat importance in non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health\nmonitoring (SHM) as it is non-dispersive, while excitation and reception of SH0\nwaves using piezoelectrics is always a challenge. In this work, we firstly\ndemonstrate via finite element simulations that face-shear piezoelectrics is\nsuperior to thickness-shear piezoelectrics in driving SH waves. Next, by using\na newly defined face-shear d24 PZT wafer as actuator and face-shear d36 PMN-PT\nwafers as sensors, pure SH0 wave was successfully excited in an aluminum plate\nfrom 140 kHz to 190 kHz. Then, it was shown that the face-shear d24 PZT wafer\ncould receive the SH0 wave only and filter the Lamb waves over a wide frequency\nrange (120 kHz to 230 kHz). The directionality of the excited SH0 wave was also\ninvestigated using face-shear d24 PZT wafers as both actuators and sensors.\nResults show that pure SH0 wave can be excited symmetrically along two\northogonal directions (0{\\deg} and 90{\\deg} ) and the amplitude of the excited\nSH0 wave can keep over 90% of the maximum amplitude when the deviate angle is\nwithin 30{\\deg}. This work could greatly promote the applications of SH waves\nin NDT and SHM.\n", "  Solid state cavity quantum electrodynamics is a rapidly advancing field which\nexplores the frontiers of light-matter coupling. Plasmonic approaches are of\nparticular interest in this field, since they carry the potential to squeeze\noptical modes to spaces significantly below the diffraction limit1,2, enhancing\nlight-matter coupling. They further serve as an architecture to design\nultra-fast, non-linear integrated circuits with smallest footprints3.\nTransition metal dichalcogenides are ideally suited as the active material in\nsuch circuits as they interact strongly with light at the ultimate monolayer\nlimit4. Here, we implement a Tamm-plasmon-polariton structure, and study the\ncoupling to a monolayer of WSe2, hosting highly stable excitons5.\nExciton-Polariton formation at room temperature is manifested in the\ncharacteristic energy-momentum dispersion relation studied in\nphotoluminescence, featuring an anti-crossing between the exciton and photon\nmodes with a Rabi-splitting of 23.5 meV. Creating polaritonic quasi-particles\nin plasmonic architectures with atomic monolayers under ambient conditions is a\ncrucial step towards compact, highly non-linear integrated photonic and\npolaritonic circuits6,7.\n", "  We explore the butterfly effect for black holes with rotation or charge. We\nperturb rotating BTZ and charged black holes in 2+1 dimensions by adding a\nsmall perturbation on one asymptotic region, described by a shock wave in the\nspacetime, and explore the effect of this shock wave on the length of geodesics\nthrough the wormhole and hence on correlation functions. We find the effect of\nthe perturbation grows exponentially at a rate controlled by the temperature;\ndependence on the angular momentum or charge does not appear explicitly. We\ncomment on issues affecting the extension to higher-dimensional charged black\nholes.\n", "  We consider the two-loop Phi-derivable approximation for the O(2)-symmetric\nscalar model, augmented by the symmetry improvement introduced in [A. Pilaftsis\nand D. Teresi, Nucl. Phys. B874, 594 (2013)], which enforces Goldstone's\ntheorem in the broken phase. Although the corresponding equations admit a\nsolution in the presence of a large enough infrared (IR) regulating scale, we\nargue that, for smooth ultraviolet (UV) regulators, the solution is lost when\nthe IR scale becomes small enough. Infrared regular solutions exist for certain\nnon-analytic UV regulators, but we argue that these solutions are artifacts\nwhich should disappear when the sensitivity to the UV regulator is removed by a\nrenormalization procedure. The loss of solution is observed both at zero and at\nfinite temperature, although it is simpler to identify in the latter case. We\nalso comment on possible ways to cure this problem.\n", "  We study the geometry of gauge fluxes in four-dimensional F-theory vacua with\ngauge group SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)xU(1) and its implications for phenomenology. The\nmodels are defined by a previously introduced class of elliptic fibrations\nwhose fibre is given as a cubic hypersurface in ${\\rm Bl}_2{\\mathbb P}^2$, with\nthe non-abelian gauge group factors SU(3)xSU(2) engineered torically via the\ntop construction. To describe gauge fluxes on these fibrations we provide a\nclassification of the primary vertical middle cohomology group in a fashion\nvalid for any choice of base space. Using the ideal theoretic technique of\nprimary decomposition we compute the cohomology classes of the matter surfaces\nassociated with states charged under the non-abelian gauge group. These\nexpressions allow us to interpret the cancellation of the pure and mixed\nnon-abelian anomalies geometrically as a result of the general form of the\nmatter surfaces, without reference to a specific type of gauge flux. Explicit\nresults for the chiral indices of all matter states are obtained in terms of\nintersection numbers of the base and can be directly applied to any choice of\nbase consistent with the fibration. As a demonstration we scan for globally\nconsistent F-theory vacua on $\\mathbb P^3$, ${\\rm Bl}_1\\mathbb P^3$ and ${\\rm\nBl}_2 \\mathbb{P}^3$, and find a globally consistent flux configuration with the\nchiral Standard Model spectrum plus an extra triplet pair, which may be lifted\nby a recombination process.\n", "  Kinetic processes in fractal stellar media are analysed in terms of the\napproach developed in our earlier paper (Chumak \\& Rastorguev, 2015) involving\na generalization of the nearest neighbour and random force distributions to\nfractal media. Diffusion is investigated in the approximation of\nscale-dependent conditional density based on an analysis of the solutions of\nthe corresponding Langevin equations. It is shown that kinetic parameters (time\nscales, coefficients of dynamic friction, diffusion, etc.) for fractal stellar\nmedia can differ significantly both qualitatively and quantitatively from the\ncorresponding parameters for a quasi-uniform random media with limited\nfluctuations. The most important difference is that in the fractal case kinetic\nparameters depend on spatial scale length and fractal dimension of the medium\nstudied. A generalized kinetic equation for stellar media (fundamental equation\nof stellar dynamics) is derived in the Fokker-Planck approximation with the\nallowance for the fractal properties of the spatial stellar density\ndistribution. Also derived are its limit forms that can be used to describe\nsmall departures of fractal gravitating medium from equilibrium.\n", "  We show that there exists a simple generalization of Kazakov's multicritical\none-matrix model, which interpolates between the various multicritical points\nof the model. The associated multicritical potential takes the form of a power\nseries with a heavy tail, leading to a cut of the potential and its derivative\nat the real axis, and reduces to a polynomial at Kazakov's multicritical\npoints. From the combinatorial point of view the generalized model allows\npolygons of arbitrary large degrees (or vertices of arbitrary large degree,\nwhen considering the dual graphs), and it is the weight assigned to these large\norder polygons which brings about the interpolation between the multicritical\npoints in the one-matrix model.\n", "  We investigate the effects of fluctuations on the dynamics of an isolated\nquantum system represented by a $\\phi^4$ field theory with $O(N)$ symmetry\nafter a quench in $d>2$ spatial dimensions. A perturbative\nrenormalization-group approach involving a dimensional expansion in\n$\\epsilon=4-d$ is employed in order to study the evolution within a prethermal\nregime controlled by elastic dephasing. In particular, we focus on a quench\nfrom a disordered initial state to the critical point, which introduces an\neffective temporal boundary in the evolution. At this boundary, the relevant\nfields acquire an anomalous scaling dimension, while the evolution of both the\norder parameter and its correlation and response functions display universal\naging. Since the relevant excitations propagate ballistically, a light cone in\nreal space emerges. At longer times, the onset of inelastic scattering appears\nas secularly growing self-generated dissipation in the effective Keldysh field\ntheory, with the strength of the dissipative vertices providing an estimate for\nthe time needed to leave the prethermal regime.\n", "  The CKM matrix, V, relates the quark mass and flavor bases. In the standard\nmodel, V is unitary 3X3, and specified by four arbitrary parameters, including\na phase allowing for $CP$ violation. We review the experimental determination\nof V, including the four parameters in the standard model context. This is an\nactive field; the precision of experimental measurements and theoretical inputs\ncontinues to improve. The consistency of the determination with the standard\nmodel unitarity is investigated. While there remain some issues the overall\nagreement with standard model unitarity is good.\n", "  Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are material surfaces that shape\nfinite-time tracer patterns in flows with arbitrary time dependence. Depending\non their deformation properties, elliptic and hyperbolic LCSs have been\nidentified from different variational principles, solving different equations.\nHere we observe that, in three dimensions, initial positions of all variational\nLCSs are invariant manifolds of the same autonomous dynamical system, generated\nby the intermediate eigenvector field, $\\xi_{2}(x_{0})$, of the Cauchy-Green\nstrain tensor. This $\\xi_{2}$-system allows for the detection of LCSs in any\nunsteady flow by classic methods, such as Poincar\\'e maps, developed for\nautonomous dynamical systems. As examples, we consider both steady and\ntime-aperiodic flows, and use their dual $\\xi_{2}$-system to uncover both\nhyperbolic and elliptic LCSs from a single computation.\n", "  The evolution of a generally covariant theory is under-determined. One\nhundred years ago such dynamics had never before been considered; its\nramifications were perplexing, its future important role for all the\nfundamental interactions under the name gauge principle could not be foreseen.\nWe recount some history regarding Einstein, Hilbert, Klein and Noether and the\nnovel features of gravitational energy that led to Noether's two theorems.\nUnder-determined evolution is best revealed in the Hamiltonian formulation. We\ndeveloped a covariant Hamiltonian formulation. The Hamiltonian boundary term\ngives covariant expressions for the quasi-local energy, momentum and angular\nmomentum. Gravity can be considered as a gauge theory of the local Poincar\\'e\ngroup. The dynamical potentials of the Poincar\\'e gauge theory of gravity are\nthe frame and the connection. The spacetime geometry has in general both\ncurvature and torsion. Torsion naturally couples to spin; it could have a\nsignificant magnitude and yet not be noticed, except on a cosmological scale\nwhere it could have significant effects.\n", "  We address the problem of a participatory decision-making process where a\nshared priority list of alternatives has to be obtained while avoiding\ninconsistent decisions. An agent-based model (ABM) is proposed to mimic this\nprocess in different social networks of stakeholders who interact according to\nan opinion dynamics model. Simulations' results show the efficacy of\ninteraction in finding a transitive and, above all, shared decision. These\nfindings are in agreement with real participation experiences regarding\ntransport planning decisions and can give useful suggestions on how to plan an\neffective participation process for sustainable policy-making based on opinion\nconsensus.\n", "  We describe a mechanism to control energy and magnetisation currents in an\nartificial spin-chain, consisting of an array of Permalloy nano-disks coupled\nthrough the magneto-dipolar interaction. The chain is kept out of equilibrium\nby two thermal baths with different temperatures connected to its ends, which\ncontrol the current propagation. Transport is enhanced by applying a uniform\nradio frequency pump field resonating with some of the spin-wave modes of the\nchain. Moreover, the two currents can be controlled independently by tuning the\nstatic field applied on the chain. Thus we describe two effective means for the\nindependent control of coupled currents and the enhancement of thermal and\nspin-wave conductivity in a realistic magnonics device, suggesting that similar\neffects could be observed in a large class of nonlinear oscillating systems.\n", "  We present an exploratory study of the $\\Lambda_{c,b}\\to N^*$-form factors\nand the semileptonic decay width within the framework of light-cone sum rules.\nWe use two different methods and two different interpolating currents for the\n$\\Lambda_{c,b}$. As interpolating currents we choose an axial-vector like and a\npseudoscalar like current. Our results show that the procedure of eliminating\nnegative parity partners is not well suited for the case at hand and that the\nsecond approach using structures with highest powers of $p_+$ with an\naxial-vector like interpolating current gives the most reliable results. Our\npredictions are based on the models obtained in\n\\cite{Anikin:2015ita,Braun:2014wpa}. The largest uncertainty comes from the\nuncertainty of the twist 4 parameters $\\eta_{10},\\,\\eta_{11}$ and we take the\nspread between the two models in \\cite{Anikin:2015ita} as a measure for this.\nWe get \\begin{eqnarray} \\Gamma(\\Lambda_b\\to N^*(1535) l\n\\nu)&=&\\left(0.0058^{+0.0010}_{-0.0009}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\dfrac{V_{ub}}{3.5\\cdot10^{-3}}\\right)^2,\\quad\\mbox{LCSR(1)}\n\\nonumber \\Gamma(\\Lambda_b\\to N^*(1535) l\n\\nu)&=&\\left(0.00070^{+0.00012}_{-0.00011}\\right)\\cdot\\left(\\dfrac{V_{ub}}{3.5\\cdot10^{-3}}\\right)^2,\\quad\\mbox{LCSR(2)}\n\\nonumber \\Gamma(\\Lambda_c\\to N^*(1535) l\n\\nu)&=&\\left(0.0064^{+0.0012}_{-0.0011}\\right)\\cdot\n\\left(\\dfrac{V_{cd}}{0.225}\\right)^2,\\quad\\mbox{LCSR(1)}\\nonumber\n\\Gamma(\\Lambda_c\\to N^*(1535) l\n\\nu)&=&\\left(0.00077^{+0.00016}_{-0.00014}\\right)\\cdot\n\\left(\\dfrac{V_{cd}}{0.225}\\right)^2,\\quad\\mbox{LCSR(2)}\\nonumber\n\\end{eqnarray} as predictions for the respective decay widths, where LCSR(1)\nand LCSR(2) refer to the two different models of the distribution amplitudes of\nthe $N^*$. It is seen that even a rough measurement of these decays will\ngreatly help to discriminate different models.\n", "  A phenomenological model for spectral broadening of incoherent light in\nsilica fibers via self-phase modulation and dispersion is presented, aiming at\nproviding a qualitative and readily accessible description of incoherent light\nspectral broadening. In this model, the incoherent light is approximated by a\ncosine power-modulated light with modulation parameters depending on the\ncoherent time and the dispersion in fibers. A simple and practical method for\nspectral broadening predictions is given and demonstrated by both the\nstraightforward NLSE-based numerical modeling and series of experiments\nincluding narrowband and broadband incoherent light in passive fibers and fiber\namplifiers.\n", "  The definition of Komar for the mass of a relativistic source is used as a\nstarting point to introduce volume integrals for Relativistic Multipole Moments\n(RMM). A certain generalization of the classical Gauss theorem is used to\nrewrite these multipole moments as integrals over a surface at the infinity.\nTherefore it is shown that the above generalization leads to Asymptotic\nRelativistic Multipole Moments (ARMM), recovering the multipoles of Geroch or\nThorne, when the integrals are evaluated in asympotically cartesian harmonic\ncoordinates. Relationships regarding the Thorne definition and the classical\ntheory of moments are shown.\n", "  To investigate the interplay between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic\nrheology in soft matter, we couple a stress-controlled-rheometer equipped with\na Couette cell to a light scattering setup in the imaging geometry, which\nallows us to measure both the deformation field and the microscopic dynamics.\nTo validate our setup, we test two model systems. For an elastic solid sample,\nwe recover the expected deformation field within 1 micron. For a pure viscous\nfluid seeded with tracer particles, we measure the velocity profile and the\ndynamics of the tracers, both during shear and at rest. The velocity profile is\nacquired over a gap of 5 mm with a temporal and spatial resolution of 1 s and\n100 microns, respectively. At rest, the tracer dynamics have the expected\ndiffusive behavior. Under shear, the microscopic dynamics corrected for the\naverage drift due to solid rotation scale with the local shear rate,\ndemonstrating that our setup captures correctly the relative motion of the\ntracers due to the affine deformation.\n", "  Perovskite solar cells have shown fast deterioration during actual operation\neven with encapsulation, but its mechanism has been elusive. We found the\nfundamental mechanism for irreversible degradation of perovskite materials in\nwhich trapped charges regardless of the polarity play a decisive role. A novel\nexperimental setup utilizing different polarity ions revealed that the moisture\ninduced irreversible dissociation of perovskite materials is triggered by\ncharges trapped along grain boundaries. Our finding clearly explained the\nintriguing observations why light soaking induces irreversible degradation\nwhile in the dark, moisture only causes reversible hydration, and why\ndegradation begins from different side of interface for different charge\nextraction layers. The deprotonation of organic cations by trapped charge\ninduced local electric field is attributed to the initiation of irreversible\ndecomposition.\n", "  In this paper we regularize the Kepler problem on $\\kappa$-spacetime in\nseveral different ways. First, we perform a Moser-type regularization and then\nwe proceed for the Ligon-Schaaf regularization to our problem. In particular,\ngeneralizing Heckman-de Laat (J. Symplectic Geom. 10, (2012), 463-473) in the\nnoncommutative context we show that the Ligon-Schaaf regularization map follows\nfrom an adaptation of the Moser regularization can be generalized to the Kepler\nproblem on $\\kappa$-spacetime.\n", "  We study nonlinear response of a quantum Hall system in\nsemiconductor-heterostructures via third harmonic generation process and\nnonlinear Faraday effect. We demonstrate that Faraday rotation angle and third\nharmonic radiation intensity have a characteristic Hall plateaus feature. These\nnonlinear effects remain robust against the significant broadening of Landau\nlevels. We predict realization of an experiment through the observation of the\nthird harmonic signal and Faraday rotation angle, which are within the\nexperimental feasibility.\n", "  A water-filled differentially heated rotating annulus with initially prepared\nstable vertical salinity profiles is studied in the laboratory. Based on\ntwo-dimensional horizontal particle image velocimetry (PIV) data, and infrared\ncamera visualizations, we describe the appearance and the characteristics of\nthe baroclinic instability in this original configuration. First, we show that\nwhen the salinity profile is linear and confined between two non stratified\nlayers at top and bottom, only two separate shallow fluid layers can be\ndestabilized. These unstable layers appear nearby the top and the bottom of the\ntank with a stratified motionless zone between them. This laboratory\narrangement is thus particularly interesting to model geophysical or\nastrophysical situations where stratified regions are often juxtaposed to\nconvective ones. Then, for more general but stable initial density profiles,\nstatistical measures are introduced to quantify the extent of the baroclinic\ninstability at given depths and to analyze the connections between this\ndepth-dependence and the vertical salinity profiles. We find that, although the\npresence of stable stratification generally hinders full-depth overturning,\ndouble-diffusive convection can yield development of multicellular sideways\nconvection in shallow layers and subsequently to a multilayered baroclinic\ninstability. Therefore we conclude that by decreasing the characteristic\nvertical scale of the flow, stratification may even enhance the formation of\ncyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (and thus, mixing) in a local sense.\n", "  The fraction of heavy vector mesons produced in a heavy ion collision, as\ncompared to a proton proton collision, serves as an important indication of the\nformation of a thermal medium, the quark gluon plasma. This sort of analysis\nstrongly depends on understanding the thermal effects of a medium like the\nplasma on the states of heavy mesons. In particular, it is crucial to know the\ntemperature ranges where they undergo a thermal dissociation, or melting.\nAdS/QCD models are know to provide an important tool for the calculation of\nhadronic masses, but in general are not consistent with the observation that\ndecay constants of heavy vector mesons decrease with excitation level. It has\nrecently been shown that this problem can be overcome using a soft wall\nbackground and introducing an extra energy parameter, through the calculation\nof correlation functions at a finite position of anti-de Sitter space. This\napproach leads to the evaluation of masses and decay constants of S wave\nquarkonium states with just one flavor dependent and one flavor independent\nparameters. Here we extend this more realistic model to finite temperatures and\nanalyse the thermal behavior of the states $1S, 2S$ and $ 3S$ of bottomonium\nand charmonium. The corresponding spectral function exhibits a consistent\npicture for the melting of the states where, for each flavor, the higher\nexcitations melt at lower temperatures. We estimate for these six states, the\nenergy ranges in which the heavy vector mesons undergo a transition from a well\ndefined peak in the spectral function to complete melting in the thermal\nmedium. A very clear distinction between the heavy flavors emerges, with\nbottomonium state $\\Upsilon (1S)$ surviving deconfinemet transition at\ntemperatures much larger than the critical deconfinement temperature of the\nmedium.\n", "  We show that the quantum $R$ matrix for symmetric tensor representations of\n$U_q(A^{(1)}_n)$ satisfies the sum rule required for its stochastic\ninterpretation under a suitable gauge. Its matrix elements at a special point\nof the spectral parameter are found to factorize into the form that naturally\nextends Povolotsky's local transition rate in the $q$-Hahn process for $n=1$.\nBased on these results we formulate new discrete and continuous time integrable\nMarkov processes on a one-dimensional chain in terms of $n$ species of\nparticles obeying asymmetric stochastic dynamics. Bethe ansatz eigenvalues of\nthe Markov matrices are also given.\n", "  The D3-probe-D7 brane system, oriented so as to have 2+1-dimensional Poincare\nsymmetry, is argued to be the holographic representation of a strongly\ncorrelated fractional topological insulator which exhibits a zero-field\nquantized Hall effect with half-units of Hall conductivity. The phase diagram\nof the system with charge density and external magnetic field is found and, as\nwell as charge gapped quantum Hall states, it exhibits metallic and\nsemi-metallic phases with interesting behaviours. The relationship of this to\nother models of fractional topological insulators is discussed.\n", "  These remarks open the one-day session \"50 years of Hagedorn's Temperature\nand the Statistical Bootstrap Model\". These developments set the path at CERN\ntowards the discovery of Quark-Gluon Plasma in the year 2000.\n", "  We use Renormalization Group to prove local well posedness for a generalized\nKPZ equation introduced by H. Spohn in the context of stochastic hydrodynamics.\nThe equation requires the addition of counter terms diverging with a cutoff\n$\\epsilon$ as $\\epsilon^{-1}$ and $\\log\\epsilon^{-1}$.\n", "  In this article, spatially-structured gravitational waves are investigated.\nDrawing upon analogies between electrodynamics and general relativity, a new\ngauge is found. We investigate the polarization and degrees of freedom of the\nresulting radiation. The waves are found to carry orbital angular momentum that\ncam be transferred to matter.\n", "  We consider a realistic bosonic N-particle model with unitary interactions\nrelevant for Efimov physics. Using quantum Monte Carlo methods, we find that\nthe critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation is decreased with\nrespect to the ideal Bose gas. We also determine the full momentum distribution\nof the gas, including its universal asymptotic behavior, and compare this\ncrucial observable to recent experimental data. Similar to the experiments with\ndifferent atomic species, differentiated solely by a three-body length scale,\nour model only depends on a single parameter. We establish a weak influence of\nthis parameter on physical observables. In current experiments, the\nthermodynamic instability of our model from the atomic gas towards an Efimov\nliquid could be masked by the dynamical instability due to three-body losses.\n", "  We have incorporated our experimentally derived thermal rate coefficients for\nC + H$_3^+$ forming CH$^+$ and CH$_2^+$ into a commonly used astrochemical\nmodel. We find that the Arrhenius-Kooij equation typically used in chemical\nmodels does not accurately fit our data and use instead a more versatile\nfitting formula. At a temperature of 10 K and a density of 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, we\nfind no significant differences in the predicted chemical abundances, but at\nhigher temperatures of 50, 100, and 300 K we find up to factor of 2 changes.\nAdditionally, we find that the relatively small error on our thermal rate\ncoefficients, $\\sim15\\%$, significantly reduces the uncertainties on the\npredicted abundances compared to those obtained using the currently implemented\nLangevin rate coefficient with its estimated factor of 2 uncertainty.\n", "  Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is expected to be a key technology to\nsignificantly increase the areal storage density of magnetic recording devices.\nAt high temperatures thermally induced noise becomes a major problem, which\nmust be overcome in order to reliably write magnetic bits with narrow\ntransitions. We propose an elementary model based on the effective recording\ntime window (ERTW) to compute the switching probability of bits during HARM of\nbit-patterned media. With few assumptions this analytical model allows to gain\ndeeper insights into the basic noise mechanisms like AC and DC noise. Finally,\nwe discuss strategies to reduce noise and to increase the areal storage density\nof both bit-patterned as well as granular media.\n", "  In a weakly coupled gravity theory in the anti-de Sitter space, local states\nin the bulk are linear superpositions of Ishibashi states for a crosscap in the\ndual conformal field theory. The superposition structure can be constrained\neither by the microscopic causality in the bulk gravity or the bootstrap\ncondition in the boundary conformal field theory. We show, contrary to some\nexpectation, that these two conditions are not compatible to each other in the\nweak gravity regime. We also present an evidence to show that bulk local states\nin three dimensions are not organized by the Virasoro symmetry.\n", "  Interference between multiple distinct paths is a defining property of\nquantum physics, where \"paths\" may involve actual physical trajectories, as in\ninterferometry, or transitions between different internal (e.g. spin) states,\nor both. A hallmark of quantum coherent evolution is the possibility to\ninteract with a system multiple times in a phase-preserving manner. This\nprinciple underpins powerful multi-dimensional optical and nuclear magnetic\nresonance spectroscopies and related techniques, including Ramsey's method of\nseparated oscillatory fields used in atomic clocks. Previously established for\natomic, molecular and quantum dot systems, recent developments in the optical\nquantum state preparation of free electron beams suggest a transfer of such\nconcepts to the realm of ultrafast electron imaging and spectroscopy. Here, we\ndemonstrate the sequential coherent interaction of free electron states with\ntwo spatially separated, phase-controlled optical near-fields. Ultrashort\nelectron pulses are acted upon in a tailored nanostructure featuring two\nnear-field regions with anisotropic polarization response. The amplitude and\nrelative phase of these two near-fields are independently controlled by the\nincident polarization state, allowing for constructive and destructive quantum\ninterference of the subsequent interactions. Future implementations of such\nelectron-light interferometers may yield unprecedented access to optically\nphase-resolved electronic dynamics and dephasing mechanisms with attosecond\nprecision.\n", "  We study the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of warped $AdS_3$ compactifications of\ntype IIB with five-form flux which are dual to $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs in two\ndimensions. We prove that the spectra of fluctuations of both the spin 2 sector\nof the graviton and the axio-dilaton are bounded. At the bound the modes have\nthe correct quantum numbers to be chiral primaries and descendants thereof\nrespectively. Moreover, we prove that the same modes give rise to superpartners\nin the dilatino spectrum. Our results show that a subset of the mesonic chiral\nring of the dual SCFT is isomorphic to the first Kohn-Rossi cohomology groups.\nAs an example, we consider the compactification of four-dimensional $Y^{p,q}$\ntheories on Riemann surfaces for the case of the universal twist. We conclude\nby studying fluctuations of the three-form, where we are able to identify Betti\nmultiplets after imposing some mild assumptions.\n", "  Understanding and predicting outbreaks of contagious diseases are crucial to\nthe development of society and public health, especially for underdeveloped\ncountries. However, challenging problems are encountered because of complex\nepidemic spreading dynamics influenced by spatial structure and human dynamics\n(including both human mobility and human interaction intensity). We propose a\nsystematical model to depict nationwide epidemic spreading in C\\^{o}te\nd'Ivoire, which integrates multiple factors, such as human mobility, human\ninteraction intensity, and demographic features. We provide insights to aid in\nmodeling and predicting the epidemic spreading process by data-driven\nsimulation and theoretical analysis, which is otherwise beyond the scope of\nlocal evaluation and geometrical views. We show that the requirement that the\naverage local basic reproductive number to be greater than unity is not\nnecessary for outbreaks of epidemics. The observed spreading phenomenon can be\nroughly explained as a heterogeneous diffusion-reaction process by redefining\nmobility distance according to the human mobility volume between nodes, which\nis beyond the geometrical viewpoint. However, the heterogeneity of human\ndynamics still poses challenges to precise prediction.\n", "  Three dimensional blob dynamics are simulated in X-point magnetic\nconfigurations in the TORPEX device via a non-field-aligned coordinate system,\nusing an isothermal model which evolves density, vorticity, parallel velocity\nand parallel current density. By modifying the parallel gradient operator to\ninclude perpendicular perturbations from poloidal field coils, numerical\nsingularities associated with field aligned coordinates are avoided. A\ncomparison with a previously developed analytical model is performed and an\nagreement is found with minimal modification. Experimental comparison\ndetermines that the null region can cause an acceleration of filaments due to\nincreasing connection length, but this acceleration is small relative to other\neffects, which we quantify. Experimental measurements are reproduced, and the\ndominant acceleration mechanism is identified as that of a developing dipole in\na moving background. Contributions from increasing connection length close to\nthe null point are a small correction.\n", "  The magnetic moment of a baryon state is an equally important dynamical\nobservable as its mass, which encodes crucial information of its underlying\nstructure. According to the different color-flavor structure, we have\ncalculated the magnetic moments of the hidden-charm pentaquark states with\n$J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^{\\pm}$, ${\\frac{3}{2}}^{\\pm}$, ${\\frac{5}{2}}^{\\pm}$ and\n${\\frac{7}{2}}^{+}$ in the molecular model, the diquark-triquark model and the\ndiquark-diquark-antiquark model respectively. Although a good description for\nthe pentaquark mass spectrum and decay patterns has been obtained in all the\nthree models, different color-flavor structures lead to different magnetic\nmoments, which can be used to pin down their inner structures and distinguish\nvarious models.\n", "  We consider supersymmetric grand unified theories with soft\nsupersymmetry-breaking scalar masses $m_0$ specified above the GUT scale\n(super-GUTs) and patterns of Yukawa couplings motivated by upper limits on\nflavour-changing interactions beyond the Standard Model. If the scalar masses\nare smaller than the gaugino masses $m_{1/2}$, as is expected in no-scale\nmodels, the dominant effects of renormalization between the input scale and the\nGUT scale are generally expected to be those due to the gauge couplings, which\nare proportional to $m_{1/2}$ and generation-independent. In this case, the\ninput scalar masses $m_0$ may violate flavour maximally, a scenario we call\nMaxSFV, and there is no supersymmetric flavour problem. We illustrate this\npossibility within various specific super-GUT scenarios that are deformations\nof no-scale gravity.\n", "  This article considers non-relativistic charged particle dynamics in both\nstatic and non-static electromagnetic fields, which are governed by\nnonseparable, possibly time-dependent Hamiltonians. For the first time,\nexplicit symplectic integrators of arbitrary high-orders are constructed for\naccurate and efficient simulations of such mechanical systems. Performances\nsuperior to the standard non-symplectic method of Runge-Kutta are demonstrated\non two examples: the first is on the confined motion of a particle in a static\ntoroidal magnetic field used in tokamak; the second is on how time-periodic\nperturbations to a magnetic field inject energy into a particle via parametric\nresonance at a specific frequency.\n", "  We present results from a search for gravitational-wave bursts coincident\nwith a set of two core-collapse supernovae observed between 2007 and 2011. We\nemploy data from the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory\n(LIGO), the Virgo gravitational-wave observatory, and the GEO 600\ngravitational-wave observatory. The targeted core-collapse supernovae were\nselected on the basis of (1) proximity (within approximately 15 Mpc), (2)\ntightness of observational constraints on the time of core collapse that\ndefines the gravitational-wave search window, and (3) coincident operation of\nat least two interferometers at the time of core collapse. We find no plausible\ngravitational-wave candidates. We present the probability of detecting signals\nfrom both astrophysically well-motivated and more speculative\ngravitational-wave emission mechanisms as a function of distance from Earth,\nand discuss the implications for the detection of gravitational waves from\ncore-collapse supernovae by the upgraded Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors.\n", "  We propose to combine cepstrum and nonlinear time-frequency (TF) analysis to\nstudy mutiple component oscillatory signals with time-varying frequency and\namplitude and with time-varying non-sinusoidal oscillatory pattern. The concept\nof cepstrum is applied to eliminate the wave-shape function influence on the TF\nanalysis, and we propose a new algorithm, named de-shape synchrosqueezing\ntransform (de-shape SST). The mathematical model, adaptive non-harmonic model,\nis introduced and the de-shape SST algorithm is theoretically analyzed. In\naddition to simulated signals, several different physiological, musical and\nbiological signals are analyzed to illustrate the proposed algorithm.\n", "  We investigate the bifurcation structure of stationary states in a dipolar\nBose-Einstein condensate located in an external PT-symmetric potential. The\nimaginary part of this external potential allows for the effective description\nof in- and out-coupling of particles. To unveil the complete bifurcation\nstructure and the properties of the exceptional points we perform an analytical\ncontinuation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which is used to describe the\nsystem. We use an elegant and numerically efficient method for the analytical\ncontinuation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with dipolar interactions\ncontaining bicomplex numbers. The Bose-Einstein condensate with dipole\ninteraction shows a much richer bifurcation scenario than a condensate without\nlong-range interactions. The inclusion of analytically continued states can\nalso explain property changes of bifurcation points which were hidden before,\nand allows for the examination of the properties of the exceptional points\nassociated with the branch points. With the new analytically continued states\nwe are able to prove the existence of an exceptional point of fifth order.\n", "  We present a review of the antineutrino spectra emitted from reactors.\nKnowledge of these and their associated uncertainties are crucial for neutrino\noscillation studies. The spectra used to-date have been determined by either\nconversion of measured electron spectra to antineutrino spectra or by summing\nover all of the thousands of transitions that makeup the spectra using modern\ndatabases as input. The uncertainties in the subdominant corrections to\nbeta-decay plague both methods, and we provide estimates of these\nuncertainties. Improving on current knowledge of the antineutrino spectra from\nreactors will require new experiments. Such experiments would also address the\nso-called reactor neutrino anomaly and the possible origin of the shoulder\nobserved in the antineutrino spectra measured in recent high-statistics reactor\nneutrino experiments.\n", "  It is shown that the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field\ngenerally induce a torque at the interface of an anisotropic material with\nanother anisotropic or isotropic material. It is proven that this torque\ndepends on an interface zero-point energy determined by the dispersion of the\ninterface (localized and extended) modes. Our theory demonstrates that the\nsingle-interface torque is essential to understand the Casimir physics of\nmaterial systems with anisotropic elements and determines the equilibrium\npositions of the system.\n", "  General non-singular accelerating cosmological solutions for an initial\ncosmic period of pure vacuum birth era are derived. This vacuum era is\ndescribed by a varying cosmological \"constant\" suggested by the Renormalisation\nGroup flow of Asymptotic Safety scenario near the ultraviolet fixed point. In\nthis scenario, natural exit from inflation to the standard decelerating\ncosmology occurs when the energy scale lowers and the cosmological \"constant\"\nbecomes insignificant. In the following period where matter is also present,\ncosmological solutions with characteristics similar to the vacuum case are\ngenerated. Remarkably the set of equations allow for particle production and\nentropy generation. Alternatively, in the case of non-zero bulk viscosity,\nentropy production and reheating is found. As for the equations of motion, they\nmodify Einstein equations by adding covariant kinetic terms of the cosmological\n\"constant\" which respect the Bianchi identities. An advance of the proposed\nframework is that it ensures a consistent description of both a quantum vacuum\nbirth of the universe and a subsequent cosmic era in the presence of matter.\n", "  Stability of soliton families in one-dimensional nonlinear Schroedinger\nequations with non-parity-time (PT)-symmetric complex potentials is\ninvestigated numerically. It is shown that these solitons can be linearly\nstable in a wide range of parameter values both below and above phase\ntransition. In addition, a pseudo-Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcation is revealed,\nwhere pairs of purely-imaginary eigenvalues in the linear-stability spectra of\nsolitons collide and bifurcate off the imaginary axis, creating oscillatory\ninstability, which resembles Hamiltonian-Hopf bifurcations of solitons in\nHamiltonian systems even though the present system is dissipative and\nnon-Hamiltonian. The most important numerical finding is that, eigenvalues of\nlinear-stability operators of these solitons appear in quartets $(\\lambda,\n-\\lambda, \\lambda^*, -\\lambda^*)$, similar to conservative systems and\nPT-symmetric systems. This quartet eigenvalue symmetry is very surprising for\nnon-PT-symmetric systems, and it has far-reaching consequences on the stability\nbehaviors of solitons.\n", "  In this article, we propose a new numerical model for computation of the\ntransport of electrons in a graphene device. The underlying quantum model for\ngraphene is a massless Dirac equation, whose eigenvalues display a conical\nsingularity responsible for non adiabatic transitions between the two modes. We\nfirst derive a kinetic model which takes the form of two Boltzmann equations\ncoupled by a collision operator modeling the non-adiabatic transitions. This\ncollision term includes a Landau-Zener transfer term and a jump operator whose\npresence is essential in order to ensure a good energy conservation during the\ntransitions. We propose an algorithmic realization of the semi-group solving\nthe kinetic model, by a particle method. We give analytic justification of the\nmodel and propose a series of numerical experiments studying the influences of\nthe various sources of errors between the quantum and the kinetic models.\n", "  The problem of finding general quartic interaction terms between fields of\nhigher helicities on the light-front is discussed from the point of view of\ncalculating the corresponding amplitudes directly from the cubic vertices using\nBCFW recursion. Amplitude based no-go results that has appeared in the\nliterature are reviewed and discussed and it is pointed out how they may\nperhaps be circumvented.\n", "  I review the influence jets and the bubbles they inflate might have on their\nambient gas as they operate through a negative jet feedback mechanism (JFM). I\ndiscuss astrophysical systems where jets are observed to influence the ambient\ngas, in many cases by inflating large, hot, and low-density bubbles, and\nsystems where the operation of the JFM is still a theoretical suggestion. The\nfirst group includes cooling flows in galaxies and clusters of galaxies,\nstar-forming galaxies, young stellar objects, and bipolar planetary nebulae.\nThe second group includes core collapse supernovae, the common envelope\nevolution, the grazing envelope evolution, and intermediate luminosity optical\ntransients. The suggestion that the JFM operates in these four types of systems\nis based on the assumption that jets are much more common than what is inferred\nfrom objects where they are directly observed. Common to all eight types of\nsystems reviewed here is the presence of a compact object inside an extended\nambient gas. The ambient gas serves as a potential reservoir of mass to be\naccreted on to the compact object. If the compact object launches jets as it\naccretes mass, the jets might reduce the accretion rate as they deposit energy\nto the ambient gas, or even remove the entire ambient gas, hence closing a\nnegative feedback cycle.\n", "  Within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation, an explicit expression\nfor the ground state energy of inhomogeneous Bose gas is derived as a\nfunctional of the inhomogeneous density of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The\nresults obtained are based on existence of the off-diagonal long-range order in\nthe single-particle density matrix for systems with a Bose-Einstein condensate.\nThis makes it possible to avoid the use of anomalous averages. The explicit\nform of the kinetic energy, which differs from one in the Gross-Pitaevski\napproach, is found. This form is valid beyond the Hartree-Fock approximation\nand can be applied for arbitrary strong interparticle interaction.\n", "  QCD at finite densities of heavy quarks is investigated using the\ndensity-of-states method. The phase factor expectation value of the quark\ndeterminant is calculated to unprecedented precision as a function of the\nchemical potential. Results are validated using those from a reweighting\napproach where the latter can produce a significant signal-to-noise ratio. We\nconfirm the particle-hole symmetry at low temperatures, find a strong sign\nproblem at intermediate values of the chemical potential, and an inverse Silver\nBlaze feature for chemical potentials close to the onset value: here, the phase\nquenched theory underestimates the density of the full theory.\n", "  In this work, we study the nonequilibrium statistical properties of the\nrelaxation dynamics of a nanoparticle trapped in a harmonic potential. We\nreport an exact time-dependent analytical solution to the Langevin dynamics\nthat arises from the stochastic differential equation of our system's energy in\nthe underdamped regime. By utilizing this stochastic thermodynamics approach,\nwe are able to completely describe the heat exchange process between the\nnanoparticle and the surrounding environment. As an important consequence of\nour results, we observe the validity of the heat exchange fluctuation theorem\n(XFT) in our setup, which holds for systems arbitrarily far from equilibrium\nconditions. By extending our results for the case of $N$ noninterating\nnanoparticles, we perform analytical asymptotic limits and direct numerical\nsimulations that corroborate our analytical predictions.\n", "  In this paper, we study rotating boson stars in the large coupling limit as\nwell as in the Newtonian limit. We investigate the equilibrium solutions in\nfour and five dimensions by adopting some analytical approximations. We show\nthat the relations among the radius, angular momentum, Newtonian energy and\nquadrupole moment (for the four-dimensional solution) of the boson star can be\nqualitatively realized for the minimal number of boson star parameters.\n", "  We present a table-top coherent diffraction imaging (CDI) experiment based on\nhigh-order harmonics generated at 18 nm by a high average power femtosecond\nfiber laser system. The high photon flux, narrow spectral bandwidth and high\ndegree of spatial coherence allow for ultra-high sub-wavelength resolution\nimaging at a high numerical aperture. Our experiments demonstrate a half-pitch\nresolution of 13.6 nm, very close to the actual Abbe-limit of 12.4 nm, which is\nthe highest resolution achieved from any table-top XUV or X-ray microscope. In\naddition, 20.5 nm resolution was achieved with only 3 sec of integration time\nbringing live diffraction imaging and 3D tomography on the nanoscale one step\ncloser to reality. The current resolution is solely limited by the wavelength\nand the detector size. Thus, table-top nanoscopes with only a few-nm\nresolutions are in reach and will find applications in many areas of science\nand technology.\n", "  In many-body systems the convolution approximation states that the 3-point\nstatic structure function, $S^{(3)}(\\textbf{k}_{1},\\textbf{k}_{2})$, can\napproximately be \"factorized\" in terms of the 2-point counterpart,\n$S^{(2)}(\\textbf{k}_{1})$. We investigate the validity of this approximation in\n3-dimensional strongly-coupled Yukawa liquids: the factorization is tested for\nspecific arrangements of the wave vectors $\\textbf{k}_{1}$ and\n$\\textbf{k}_{2}$, with molecular dynamics simulations. With the increase of the\ncoupling parameter we find a breakdown of factorization, of which a notable\nexample is the appearance of negative values of\n$S^{(3)}(\\textbf{k}_{1},\\textbf{k}_{2})$, whereas the approximate factorized\nform is restricted to positive values. These negative values -- based on the\nquadratic Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem -- imply that the quadratic part of\nthe density response of the system changes sign with wave number. Our\nsimulations that incorporate an external potential energy perturbation clearly\nconfirm this behavior.\n", "  We prove that any non zero inertia, however small, is able to change the\nnature of the synchronization transition in Kuramoto-like models, either from\ncontinuous to discontinuous, or from discontinuous to continuous. This result\nis obtained through an unstable manifold expansion in the spirit of J.D.\nCrawford, which features singularities in the vicinity of the bifurcation. Far\nfrom being unwanted artifacts, these singularities actually control the\nqualitative behavior of the system. Our numerical tests fully support this\npicture.\n", "  We describe the QQbar_threshold library for computing the production cross\nsection of heavy quark-antiquark pairs near threshold at electron-positron\ncolliders. The prediction includes all presently known QCD, electroweak, Higgs,\nand nonresonant corrections in the combined nonrelativistic and weak-coupling\nexpansion.\n", "  We consider the SM extension with additional light real singlet scalar,\nright-handed neutrino and nonrenormalizable Yukawa interaction for the first\ntwo generations. We show that the proposed model can explain the observed $(g -\n2)$ muon anomaly. Phenomenological consequences as flavour violating decays\n$\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu\\mu\\mu, \\mu \\mu e,\n  \\mu e e $ are briefly discussed. We also propose the $U_R(1)$ gauge\ngeneralization of the SM with complex scalar singlet and nonzero right-handed\ncharges for the first two generations.\n", "  We observed a new mechanism for vortex nucleation in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) subject to synthetic magnetic fields. We made use of a\nstrong synthetic magnetic field initially localized between a pair of merging\nBECs to rapidly create vortices in the bulk of the merged condensate. Unlike\nprevious implementations and in agreement with our Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nsimulations, our dynamical process rapidly injects vortices into our system's\nbulk, and with initial number in excess of the system's equilibrium vortex\nnumber.\n", "  Turbulent plasma flow, amplified by rapid 3D compression, can be suddenly\ndissipated under continuing compression. This effect relies on the sensitivity\nof the plasma viscosity to the temperature, $\\mu \\sim T^{5/2}$. The plasma\nviscosity is also sensitive to the plasma ionization state. We show that the\nsudden dissipation phenomenon may be prevented when the plasma ionization state\nincreases during compression, and demonstrate the regime of net viscosity\ndependence on compression where sudden dissipation is guaranteed. Additionally,\nit is shown that, compared to cases with no ionization, ionization during\ncompression is associated with larger increases in turbulent energy, and can\nmake the difference between growing and decreasing turbulent energy.\n", "  We present a new release of the QCDLoop library based on a modern\nobject-oriented framework. We discuss the available new features such as the\nextension to the complex masses, the possibility to perform computations in\ndouble and quadruple precision simultaneously, and useful caching mechanisms to\nimprove the computational speed. We benchmark the performance of the new\nlibrary, and provide practical examples of phenomenological implementations by\ninterfacing this new library to Monte Carlo programs.\n", "  The monomer surface mobility is the single most important parameter that\ndecides the nucleation density and morphology of islands during thin film\ngrowth. During template-assisted surface growth in particular, low surface\nmobilities can prevent monomers from reaching target sites and this results in\na partial to complete loss of nucleation control. While in atomic systems a\nbroad range of surface mobilities can be readily accessed, for colloids, owing\nto their large size, this window is substantially narrow and therefore imposes\nsevere restrictions in extending template-assisted growth techniques to steer\ntheir self-assembly. Here, we circumvented this fundamental limitation by\ndesigning templates with spatially varying feature sizes, in this case moire\npatterns, which in the presence of short-range depletion attraction presented\nsurface energy gradients for the diffusing colloids. The templates serve a dual\npurpose, first, directing the particles to target sites by enhancing their\nsurface mean free paths and second, dictating the size and symmetry of the\ngrowing crystallites. Using optical microscopy, we directly followed the\nnucleation and growth kinetics of colloidal islands on these surfaces at the\nsingle-particle level. We demonstrate nucleation control, with high fidelity,\nin a regime that has remained unaccessed in theoretical, numerical and\nexperimental studies on atoms and molecules as well. Our findings pave the way\nfor fabricating non-trivial surface architectures composed of complex colloids\nand nanoparticles.\n", "  We measure the SZ signal toward a set of 47 clusters with a median mass of\n$9.5 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and a median redshift of 0.40 using data from\nPlanck and the ground-based Bolocam receiver. When Planck XMM-like masses are\nused to set the scale radius $\\theta_{\\textrm{s}}$, we find consistency between\nthe integrated SZ signal, $Y_{\\textrm{5R500}}$, derived from Bolocam and Planck\nbased on gNFW model fits using A10 shape parameters, with an average ratio of\n$1.069 \\pm 0.030$ (allowing for the $\\simeq 5$% Bolocam flux calibration\nuncertainty). We also perform a joint fit to the Bolocam and Planck data using\na modified A10 model with the outer logarithmic slope $\\beta$ allowed to vary,\nfinding $\\beta = 6.13 \\pm 0.16 \\pm 0.76$ (measurement error followed by\nintrinsic scatter). In addition, we find that the value of $\\beta$ scales with\nmass and redshift according to $\\beta \\propto M^{0.077 \\pm 0.026} \\times\n(1+z)^{-0.06 \\pm 0.09}$. This mass scaling is in good agreement with recent\nsimulations. We do not observe the strong trend of $\\beta$ with redshift seen\nin simulations, though we conclude that this is most likely due to our sample\nselection. Finally, we use Bolocam measurements of $Y_{500}$ to test the\naccuracy of the Planck completeness estimate. We find consistency, with the\nactual number of Planck detections falling approximately $1 \\sigma$ below the\nexpectation from Bolocam. We translate this small difference into a constraint\non the the effective mass bias for the Planck cluster cosmology results, with\n$(1-b) = 0.93 \\pm 0.06$.\n", "  A generalized spatial Talbot effect is proposed where the period of the input\naperture is scaled by a non-integer real value, as opposed to the integer-only\nfactor in a conventional Talbot effect. This is achieved by allowing and\nengineering the phase discontinuity distributions in space using metasurfaces,\nin conjunction with free-space propagation. The introduction of such abrupt\nphase discontinuities thereby enables non-integer scalings of the aperture\nperiodicities. Specific implementations using Huygens' metasurfaces are\nproposed and their operation to achieve non-integer scaling of the input\naperture period is demonstrated using numerical results based on Fourier\npropagation.\n", "  When sheared, most elastic solids such as metals, rubbers and polymer\nhydrogels dilate in the direction perpendicular to the shear plane. This\nwell-known behaviour known as the Poynting effect is characterized by a\npositive normal stress. Surprisingly, biopolymer gels made of fibrous proteins\nsuch as fibrin and collagen, as well as many biological tissues exhibit the\nopposite effect, contracting under shear and displaying a negative normal\nstress. Here we show that this anomalous behaviour originates from the open\nnetwork structure of biopolymer gels, which facilitates interstitial fluid flow\nduring shear. Using fibrin networks with a controllable pore size as a model\nsystem, we show that the normal stress response to an applied shear is positive\nat short times, but decreases to negative values with a characteristic time\nscale set by pore size. Using a two-fluid model, we develop a quantitative\ntheory that unifies the opposite behaviours encountered in synthetic and\nbiopolymer gels. Synthetic polymer gels are impermeable to solvent flow and\nthus effectively incompressible at typical experimental time scales, whereas\nbiopolymer gels are effectively compressible. Our findings suggest a new route\nto tailor elastic instabilities such as the die-swell effect that often hamper\nprocessing of polymer materials and furthermore show that poroelastic effects\nplay a much more important role in the mechanical properties of cells and\ntissues than previously anticipated.\n", "  We describe examples of drastic truncations of conformal bootstrap equations\nencoding much more information than that obtained by a direct numerical\napproach. A three-term truncation of the four point function of a free scalar\nin any space dimensions provides algebraic identities among conformal block\nderivatives which generate the exact spectrum of the infinitely many primary\noperators contributing to it. In boundary conformal field theories, we point\nout that the appearance of free parameters in the solutions of bootstrap\nequations is not an artifact of truncations, rather it reflects a physical\nproperty of permeable conformal interfaces which are described by the same\nequations. Surface transitions correspond to isolated points in the parameter\nspace. We are able to locate them in the case of 3d Ising model, thanks to a\nuseful algebraic form of 3d boundary bootstrap equations. It turns out that the\nlow-lying spectra of the surface operators in the ordinary and the special\ntransitions of 3d Ising model form two different solutions of the same\npolynomial equation. Their interplay yields an estimate of the surface\nrenormalization group exponent, $y_{h}=0.72558(18)$ for the ordinary\nuniversality class and $y_{h}=1.646(2)$ for the special universality class,\nwhich compare well with the most recent Monte Carlo calculations. Estimates of\nother surface exponents as well as OPE coefficients are also obtained.\n", "  We constrast the dynamics in model unentangled polymer melts of chains of\nthree different stiffnesses: flexible, intermediate, and rodlike. Flexible and\nrodlike chains, which readily solidify into close-packed crystals (respectively\nwith randomly oriented and nematically aligned chains), display simple melt\ndynamics with Arrhenius temperature dependence and a discontinuous change upon\nsolidification. Intermediate-stiffness chains, however, are fragile\nglass-formers displaying Vogel-Fulcher dynamical arrest, despite the fact that\nthey also possess a nematic-close-packed crystalline ground state. To connect\nthis difference in dynamics to the differing microstructure of the melts, we\nexamine how various measures of structure, including cluster-level metrics\nrecently introduced in studies of colloidal systems, vary with chain stiffness\nand temperature. No clear static-structural cause of the dynamical arrest is\nfound. However, we find that the intermediate-stiffness chains display\nqualitatively different dynamical heterogeneity. Specifically, their stringlike\ncorrelated motion (cooperative rearrangement) is correlated along chain\nbackbones in a way not found for either flexible or rodlike chains. This\nactivated \"crawling\" motion seems to be the cause of the dynamical arrest\nobserved for these systems, and shows that the factors controlling the\ncrystallization vs.\\ glass formation competition in polymers likely depend\nnonmonotonically on chain stiffness.\n", "  We present a new approach for the Cauchy-characteristic extraction of\ngravitational radiation strain, news function, and the flux of the\nenergy-momentum, supermomentum and angular momentum associated with the\nBondi-Metzner-Sachs asymptotic symmetries. In Cauchy-characteristic extraction,\na characteristic evolution code takes numerical data on an inner worldtube\nsupplied by a Cauchy evolution code, and propagates it outwards to obtain the\nspace-time metric in a neighborhood of null infinity. The metric is first\ndetermined in a scrambled form in terms of coordinates determined by the Cauchy\nformalism. In prior treatments, the waveform is first extracted from this\nmetric and then transformed into an asymptotic inertial coordinate system. This\nprocedure provides the physically proper description of the waveform and the\nradiated energy but it does not generalize to determine the flux of angular\nmomentum or supermomentum. Here we formulate and implement a new approach which\ntransforms the full metric into an asymptotic inertial frame and provides a\nuniform treatment of all the radiation fluxes associated with the asymptotic\nsymmetries. Computations are performed and calibrated using the Spectral\nEinstein Code (SpEC).\n", "  In light of the observation of a relatively large $\\theta^{}_{13}$, one has\nto consider breaking the $\\mu$-$\\tau$ symmetry properly which would otherwise\nresult in a vanishing $\\theta^{}_{13}$ (as well as $\\theta^{}_{23} = \\pi/4$).\nTherefore, we investigate various symmetry-breaking patterns and accordingly\nidentify those that are phenomenologically viable. Furthermore, the\nsymmetry-breaking effects arising from some specific physics (e.g., the\nrenormalization group equation running effect) are discussed as well.\n", "  Rogue waves appearing on deep water or in optical fibres are often modelled\nby certain breather solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (fNLS)\nequation which are referred to as solitons on finite background (SFBs). A more\ngeneral modelling of rogue waves can be achieved via the consideration of\nmultiphase, or finite-band, fNLS solutions of whom the standard SFBs and the\nstructures forming due to their collisions represent particular, degenerate,\ncases. A generalised rogue wave notion then naturally enters as a\nlarge-amplitude localised coherent structure occurring within a finite-band\nfNLS solution. In this paper, we use the winding of real tori to show the\nmechanism of the appearance of such generalized rogue waves and derive an\nanalytical criterion distinguishing finite-band potentials of the fNLS equation\nthat exhibit generalised rogue waves.\n", "  We consider a class of minimal anomaly free $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ extensions of the\nStandard Model with three generations of right-handed neutrinos and a complex\nscalar. Using electroweak precision constraints, new 13 TeV LHC data, and\nconsidering theoretical limitations such as perturbativity, we show that it is\npossible to constrain a wide class of models. By classifying these models with\na single parameter, $\\kappa$, we can put a model independent upper bound on the\nnew $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge coupling $g_z$. We find that the new dilepton data\nputs strong bounds on the parameters, especially in the mass region\n$M_{Z'}\\lesssim 3~ \\mathrm{TeV}$.\n", "  The Moir\\'{e} structure of epitaxial graphene mono layer grown on\n6H-SiC(0001) has been investigated recently by grazing incidence fast atom\ndiffraction, and the results were compared with the calculation of the\nstructure \\textit{ab initio} and exact diffraction codes. We review these\nresults and present a complementary approach using the Hard Wall Model to\nextract information without any \\textit{a priori}. Reversely, taking advantage\nof previous exact calculations we evaluate quantitatively the performance of\nthis simplified approach by comparing predictions using the same potential\nenergy surface.\n", "  We report magnetoresistance measurements of hydrogen-terminated\n(100)-oriented diamond surfaces where hole carriers are accumulated using an\nionic-liquid-gated field-effect-transistor technique. Unexpectedly, the\nobserved magnetoresistance is positive within the range of 2<T<10 K and -7<B<7\nT, in striking contrast to the negative magnetoresistance previously detected\nfor similar devices with (111)-oriented diamond surfaces. Furthermore we find:\n1) magnetoresistance is orders of magnitude larger than that of the classical\norbital magnetoresistance; 2) magnetoresistance is nearly independent of the\ndirection of the applied magnetic field; 3) for the in-plane field, the\nmagnetoresistance ratio defined as [rho(B)-rho(0)]/rho(0) follows a universal\nfunction of B/T. These results indicate that the spin degree of freedom of hole\ncarriers plays an important role in the surface conductivity of\nhydrogen-terminated (100) diamond.\n", "  It was proposed that the narrow $P_c(4450)$ structure observed by the LHCb\nCollaboration in the reaction $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi p K$ might be due to a\ntriangle singularity around the $\\chi_{c1}$--proton threshold at 4.45~GeV. We\ndiscuss the occurrence of a similar triangle singularity in the $J/\\psi p$\ninvariant mass distribution for the decay $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi p \\pi$, which\ncould explain the bump around 4.45~GeV in the data. More precise measurements\nof this process would provide valuable information towards an understanding of\nthe $P_c$ structures.\n", "  NASA is currently carrying out science and technical studies to identify its\nnext astronomy flagship mission, slated to begin development in the 2020s. It\nhas become clear that a Large Ultraviolet/Optical/IR (LUVOIR) Surveyor mission\n(primary diameter 12 m, 1000 Ang - 2 micron spectroscopic bandpass) can carry\nout the largest number of NASA's exoplanet and astrophysics science goals over\nthe coming decades. There are technical challenges for several aspects of the\nLUVOIR Surveyor concept, including component level technology readiness\nmaturation and science instrument concepts for a broadly capable ultraviolet\nspectrograph. We present the scientific motivation for, and a preliminary\ndesign of, a multiplexed ultraviolet spectrograph to support both the exoplanet\nand astrophysics goals of the LUVOIR Surveyor mission concept, the Combined\nHigh-resolution and Imaging Spectrograph for the LUVOIR Surveyor (CHISL). CHISL\nincludes a high-resolution (R 120,000; 1000 - 1700 Ang) point-source\nspectroscopy channel and a medium resolution (R > 14,000 from 1000 - 2000 Ang\nin a single observation and R 24,000 - 35,000 in multiple grating settings)\nimaging spectroscopy channel. We present the CHISL concept, a small sample of\nrepresentative science cases, and the primary technological hurdles. We are\nactively engaged in laboratory and flight characterization efforts for\nCHISL-enabling technologies as components on sounding rocket payloads under\ndevelopment at the University of Colorado. We describe two payloads that are\ndesigned to be pathfinder instruments for the high-resolution (CHESS) and\nimaging spectroscopy (SISTINE) arms of CHISL. We are carrying out this\ninstrument design, characterization, and flight-testing today to support the\nnew start of a LUVOIR Surveyor mission in the next decade.\n", "  The axion monodromy model involves a canonical scalar field that is governed\nby a linear potential with superimposed modulations. The modulations in the\npotential are responsible for a resonant behavior which gives rise to\npersisting oscillations in the scalar and, to a smaller extent, in the tensor\npower spectra. Interestingly, such spectra have been shown to lead to an\nimproved fit to the cosmological data than the more conventional, nearly scale\ninvariant, primordial power spectra. The scalar bi-spectrum in the model too\nexhibits continued modulations and the resonance is known to boost the\namplitude of the scalar non-Gaussianity parameter to rather large values. An\nanalytical expression for the scalar bi-spectrum had been arrived at earlier\nwhich, in fact, has been used to compare the model with the cosmic microwave\nbackground anisotropies at the level of three-point functions involving\nscalars. In this work, with future applications in mind, we arrive at a similar\nanalytical template for the scalar-scalar-tensor cross-correlation. We also\nanalytically establish the consistency relation (in the squeezed limit) for\nthis three-point function. We conclude with a summary of the main results\nobtained.\n", "  We take a one-dimensional tight binding chain with periodic boundary\ncondition and put a particle in an arbitrary Bloch state, then quench it by\nsuddenly changing the potential of an arbitrary site. In the ensuing time\nevolution, the probability density of the wave function at an arbitrary site\n\\emph{jumps indefinitely between plateaus}. This phenomenon adds to a former\none in which the survival probability of the particle in the initial Bloch\nstate shows \\emph{cusps} periodically, which was found in the same scenario\n[Zhang J. M. and Yang H.-T., EPL, \\textbf{114} (2016) 60001]. The plateaus\nsupport the scattering wave picture of the quench dynamics of the Bloch state.\nUnderlying the cusps and jumps is the exactly solvable, nonanalytic dynamics of\na Luttinger-like model, based on which, the locations of the jumps and the\nheights of the plateaus are accurately predicted.\n", "  We have investigated vortex states in chiral helimagnet/superconductor\nbilayer systems under an applied external magnetic field Happl, using the\nGinzburg-Landau equations. Effect of the chiral helimagnet on the\nsuperconductor is taken as a magnetic field HCHM, which is perpendicular to the\nsuperconductor and oscillates spatially. For Happl = 0 and weak HCHM, there\nappear pairs of up-and down-vortices. Increasing Happl, down-vortices gradually\ndisappear, and number of up-vortices increases in the large magnetic field\nregion. Then, up-vortices form parallel, triangular, or square structures.\n", "  A definition of the thermodynamic entropy based on the time-dependent\nprobability distribution of the macroscopic variables is developed. When a\nconstraint in a composite system is released, the probability distribution for\nthe new equilibrium values goes to a narrow peak. Defining the entropy by the\nlogarithm of the probability distribution automatically makes it a maximum at\nthe equilibrium values, so it satisfies the Second Law. It is also satisfies\nthe postulates of thermodynamics. Objections to this definition by Dieks and\nPeters are discussed and resolved.\n", "  Strongly interacting atom-cavity systems within a network with many nodes\nconstitute a possible realization for a quantum internet which allows for\nquantum communication and computation on the same platform. To implement such\nlarge-scale quantum networks, nanophotonic resonators are promising candidates\nbecause they can be scalably fabricated and interconnected with waveguides and\noptical fibers. By integrating arrays of ring resonators into a vapor cell we\nshow that thermal rubidium atoms above room temperature can be coupled to\nphotonic cavities as building blocks for chip-scale hybrid circuits. Although\nstrong coupling is not yet achieved in this first realization, our approach\nprovides a key step towards miniaturization and scalability of atom-cavity\nsystems.\n", "  We present the first public implementation of antenna-based QCD initial- and\nfinal-state showers. The shower kernels are $2\\to 3$ antenna functions, which\ncapture not only the collinear dynamics but also the leading soft (coherent)\nsingularities of QCD matrix elements. We define the evolution measure to be\ninversely proportional to the leading poles, hence gluon emissions are evolved\nin a $p_\\perp$ measure inversely proportional to the eikonal, while processes\nthat only contain a single pole (e.g., $g\\to q\\bar{q}$) are evolved in\nvirtuality. Non-ordered emissions are allowed, suppressed by an additional\npower of $1/Q^2$. Recoils and kinematics are governed by exact on-shell $2\\to\n3$ phase-space factorisations. This first implementation is limited to massless\nQCD partons and colourless resonances. Tree-level matrix-element corrections\nare included for QCD up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^4)$ (4 jets), and for\nDrell-Yan and Higgs production up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$ ($V/H$ + 3\njets). The resulting algorithm has been made publicly available in Vincia 2.0.\n", "  We study work extraction from the Dicke model achieved using simple unitary\ncyclic transformations keeping into account both a non optimal unitary\nprotocol, and the energetic cost of creating the initial state. By analyzing\nthe role of entanglement, we find that highly entangled states can be\ninefficient for energy storage when considering the energetic cost of creating\nthe state. Such surprising result holds notwithstanding the fact that the\ncriticality of the model at hand can sensibly improve the extraction of work.\nWhile showing the advantages of using a many-body system for work extraction,\nour results demonstrate that entanglement is not necessarily advantageous for\nenergy storage purposes, when non optimal processes are considered. Our work\nshows the importance of better understanding the complex interconnections\nbetween non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum systems and correlations\namong their subparts.\n", "  We report a study of interlayer exchange interaction in multilayer CoPt/Co\nstructures consisting of periodic CoPt multilayer film with an \"easy axis\"\nanisotropy and thick Co layer with an \"easy plane\" anisotropy separated by Pt\nspacer with variable thickness. The magnetooptical Kerr effect (MOKE) and\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements show up the essentially\nnon-collinear state of magnetic moments of the layers and strong exchange\ncoupling between CoPt and Co subsystems. The estimation of effective anisotropy\nand exchange coupling in a simple model based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation describing magnetization dynamics was performed.\n", "  Higgs mechanism to massive higher-spin gauge fields is an outstanding open\nproblem. We investigate this issue in the context of Kaluza-Klein\ncompactification. Starting from a free massless higher-spin field in\n$(d+2)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and compactifying over a finite\nangular wedge, we obtain an infinite tower of heavy, light and massless\nhigher-spin fields in $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. All massive\nhigher-spin fields are described gauge invariantly in terms of St\\\"ueckelberg\nfields. The spectrum depends on the boundary conditions imposed at both ends of\nthe wedges. We obseved that higher-derivative boundary condition is inevitable\nfor spin greater than three. For some higher-derivative boundary conditions,\nequivalently, spectrum-dependent boundary conditions, we get a non-unitary\nrepresentation of partially-massless higher-spin fields of varying depth. We\npresent intuitive picture which higher-derivative boundary conditions yield\nnon-unitary system in terms of boundary action. We argue that isotropic\nLifshitz interfaces in $O(N)$ Heisenberg magnet or $O(N)$ Gross-Neveu model\nprovides the holographic dual conformal field theory and propose experimental\ntest of (inverse) Higgs mechanism for massive and partially massless\nhigher-spin fields.\n", "  Advances in quantum photonics have shown that chip-scale quantum devices are\ntranslating from the realm of basic research to applied technologies. Recent\ndevelopments in integrated photonic circuits and single photon detectors\nindicate that the bottleneck for fidelity in quantum photonic processes will\nultimately lie with the photon sources. We present and demonstrate a silicon\nnanophotonic chip capable of emitting telecommunication band photon pairs that\nexhibit the highest raw degree of time-energy entanglement from a\nmicro/nanoscale source, to date. Biphotons are generated through\ncavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a high-Q silicon\nmicrodisk resonator, wherein the nature of the triply-resonant generation\nprocess leads to a dramatic Purcell enhancement, resulting in highly efficient\npair creation rates as well as extreme suppression of the photon noise\nbackground. The combination of the excellent photon source and a new phase\nlocking technique, allow for the observation of a nearly perfect coincidence\nvisibility of (96.6 $\\pm$ 1.1)$\\%$, without any background subtraction, at a\nlarge pair generation rate of (4.40 $\\pm$ 0.07) $\\times$ 10$^5$ pairs/s.\n", "  We study the Higgs boson mass and the muon anomalous magnetic moment (the\nmuon $g-2$) in a supersymmetric standard model with vector-like generations.\nThe infrared physics of the model is governed by strong renormalization-group\neffects of the gauge couplings. That leads to sizable extra Yukawa couplings of\nHiggs doublets between the second and vector-like generations in both quark and\nlepton sectors. It is found with this property that there exist wide parameter\nregions where the Higgs boson mass and the muon $g-2$ are simultaneously\nexplained.\n", "  For the first time, a versatile, eyesafe, compact and direct detection\nDoppler lidar is developed using upconversion single-photon detection method.\nAn all-fiber and polarization maintaining architecture is realized to guarantee\nthe high optical coupling efficiency and the system stability. Using\nintegrated-optic components, the conservation of etendue of the optical\nreceiver is achieved by manufacturing a fiber-coupled periodically poled\nLithium niobate waveguide and an all-fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI).\nThe so-called double-edge direct detection is implemented using a\nsingle-channel FPI and a single upconversion detector, incorporating\ntime-division multiplexing method. The relative error of the system is lower\nthan 0.1% over 9 weeks. To show the robust of the system, atmospheric wind and\nvisibility over 48 hours are detected in the boundary layer. In the\nintercomparison experiments, lidar shows good agreement with the ultrasonic\nwind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT52), with standard deviation of 1.04 m/s in\nspeed and 12.3{\\deg} in direction.\n", "  We have studied the reversal of magnetisation in Ising ferromagnet by the\nfield having gradient along a particular direction. We employed the Monte Carlo\nsimulation with Metropolis single spin flip algorithm. The average lifetime of\nthe metastable state was observed to increase with the magnitude of the\ngradient of applied field. In the high gradient regime, the system was observed\nto show two distinct region of up and down spins. The interface or the domain\nwall was observed to move as one increases the gradient. The displacement of\nthe mean position of the interface was observed to increase with the gradient\nas hyperbolic tangent function. The roughness of the interface was observed to\ndecay exponentially as the gradient increases. The number of spin flip per site\nwas observed to show a discontinuity in the vicinity of the domain wall. The\namount of the discontinuity was found to diverge with the system size as a\npower law fashion with an exponent 5/3.\n", "  In this work we study a classically scale invariant extension of the Standard\nModel that can explain simultaneously dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in\nthe universe. In our set-up we introduce a dark sector, namely a non-Abelian\nSU(2) hidden sector coupled to the SM via the Higgs portal, and a singlet\nsector responsible for generating Majorana masses for three right-handed\nsterile neutrinos. The gauge bosons of the dark sector are mass-degenerate and\nstable, and this makes them suitable as dark matter candidates. Our model also\naccounts for the matter-anti-matter asymmetry. The lepton flavour asymmetry is\nproduced during CP-violating oscillations of the GeV-scale right-handed\nneutrinos, and converted to the baryon asymmetry by the electroweak sphalerons.\nAll the characteristic scales in the model: the electro-weak, dark matter and\nthe leptogenesis/neutrino mass scales, are generated radiatively, have a common\norigin and related to each other via scalar field couplings in perturbation\ntheory.\n", "  We study the polygons governing the convex hull of a point set created by the\nsteps of $n$ independent two-dimensional random walkers. Each such walk\nconsists of $T$ discrete time steps, where $x$ and $y$ increments are i.i.d.\nGaussian. We analyze area $A$ and perimeter $L$ of the convex hulls. We obtain\nprobability densities for these two quantities over a large range of the\nsupport by using a large-deviation approach allowing us to study densities\nbelow $10^{-900}$. We find that the densities exhibit a universal scaling\nbehavior as a function of $A/T$ and $L/\\sqrt{T}$, respectively. As in the case\nof one walker ($n=1$), the densities follow Gaussian distributions for $L$ and\n$\\sqrt{A}$, respectively. We also obtained the rate functions for the area and\nperimeter, rescaled with the scaling behavior of their maximum possible values,\nand found limiting functions for $T \\rightarrow \\infty$, revealing that the\ndensities follow the large-deviation principle. These rate functions can be\ndescribed by a power law for $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ as found in the $n=1$ case.\nWe also investigated the behavior of the averages as a function of the number\nof walks $n$ and found good agreement with the predicted behavior.\n", "  An important source of opacity in exoplanet atmospheres at short visible and\nnear-UV wavelengths is Rayleigh scattering of light on molecules. It is\naccompanied by a related, albeit weaker process -- Raman scattering. We analyze\nthe signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the\ngeometric albedo of exoplanets, which could provide information about\natmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra\nof planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong\nabsorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the\nalbedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the\nreflected light causing the so-called Raman ghost lines. Raman scattering can\nalso cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a\nstellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the\nalbedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing\nconstrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman\nghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in\nthe atmosphere, even molecules like H$_2$ or N$_2$ that do not have prominent\nspectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, ghost lines\ncould also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere. In this\npaper we investigate the effects of Raman scattering in hydrogen- and\nnitrogen-dominated atmospheres. We analyze the feasibility of detecting the\nsignatures of Raman scattering with the existing and future observational\nfacilities, and of using these signatures as probes of exoplanetary\natmospheres.\n", "  Any neutral boson such as a dark photon or dark Higgs that is part of a\nnon-standard sector of particles can mix with its standard model counterpart.\nWhen very weakly mixed with the Standard Model, these particles are produced in\nthe early Universe via the freeze-in mechanism and subsequently decay back to\nstandard model particles. In this work, we place constraints on such mediator\ndecays by considering bounds from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation. We find both nucleosynthesis and CMB can\nconstrain dark photons with a kinetic mixing parameter between log {\\epsilon} ~\n-10 to -17 for masses between 1 MeV and 100 GeV. Similarly, the dark Higgs\nmixing angle {\\epsilon} with the Standard Model Higgs is constrained between\nlog {\\epsilon} ~ -6 to -15. Dramatic improvement on the bounds from CMB\nspectral distortions can be achieved with proposed experiments such as PIXIE.\n", "  We study diffusion-controlled single-species annihilation with a finite\nnumber of particles. In this reaction-diffusion process, each particle\nundergoes ordinary diffusion, and when two particles meet, they annihilate. We\nfocus on spatial dimensions $d>2$ where a finite number of particles typically\nsurvive the annihilation process. Using the rate equation approach and scaling\ntechniques we investigate the average number of surviving particles, $M$, as a\nfunction of the initial number of particles, $N$. In three dimensions, for\ninstance, we find the scaling law $M\\sim N^{1/3}$ in the asymptotic regime\n$N\\gg 1$. We show that two time scales govern the reaction kinetics: the\ndiffusion time scale, $T\\sim N^{2/3}$, and the escape time scale, $\\tau\\sim\nN^{4/3}$. The vast majority of annihilation events occur on the diffusion time\nscale, while no annihilation events occur beyond the escape time scale.\n", "  We discuss the instanton-dyon liquid model with $N_f$ Majorana quark flavors\nin the adjoint representation of color $SU_c(2)$ at finite temperature. We\nbriefly recall the index theorem on $S^1\\times R^3$ for twisted adjoint\nfermions in a BPS dyon background of arbitrary holonomy, and use the ADHM\nconstruction to explicit the adjoint anti-periodic zero modes. We use these\nresults to derive the partition function of an interacting instanton-dyon\nensemble with $N_f$ light and anti-periodic adjoint quarks. We develop the\nmodel in details by mapping the theory on a 3-dimensional quantum effective\ntheory with adjoint quarks with manifest $SU(N_f)\\times Z_{4N_f}$ symmetry.\nUsing a mean-field analysis at weak coupling and strong screening, we show that\ncenter symmetry requires the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which is\nshown to only take place for $N_f=1$. For a sufficiently dense liquid, we find\nthat the ground state is center symmetric and breaks spontaneously flavor\nsymmetry through $SU(N_f)\\times Z_{4N_f}\\rightarrow O(N_f)$. As the liquid\ndilutes with increasing temperature, center symmetry and chiral symmetry are\nrestored. We present numerical and analytical estimates for the transition\ntemperatures.\n", "  The SU(3) octet states with baryon number B = 2, hexaquark dibaryons, are\nconsidered. Decay coupling constants sum rules for dibaryon octet into two\nordinary baryon octets with ?$\\lambda_8$ first order SU(3) symmetry breaking\nare given. An SU(4) extension of the analysis is commented upon. Possibilities\nfor the experimental observation of multibaryon and anti-multibaryon states are\npointed out.\n", "  We study $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity with higher-derivative corrections that\npreserve the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and show that Kerr-Newman black\nholes are solutions to these theories. Modifications of the black hole entropy\ndue to the higher derivatives are universal and apply even in the BPS and\nSchwarzschild limits. Our solutions and their entropy are greatly simplified by\nsupersymmetry of the theory even though the black holes generally do not\npreserve any of the supersymmetry.\n", "  Non-axisymmetric stationary magnetic perturbations lead to the formation of\nhomoclinic tangles near the divertor magnetic saddle in tokamak discharges.\nThese tangles intersect the divertor plates in static helical structures that\ndelimit the regions reached by open magnetic field lines reaching the plasma\ncolumn and leading the charged particles to the strike surfaces by parallel\ntransport. In this article we introduce a non-axisymmetric rotating magnetic\nperturbation to model the time development of the three-dimensional magnetic\nfield of a single-null DIII-D tokamak discharge developing a rotating tearing\nmode. The stable and unstable manifolds of the asymmetric magnetic saddle are\ncalculated through an adaptive method providing the manifold cuts at a given\npoloidal plane and the strike surfaces. For the modeled shot, the experimental\nheat pattern and its time development are well described by the rotating\nunstable manifold, indicating the emergence of homoclinic lobes in a rotating\nframe due to the plasma instabilities. In the model it is assumed that the\nmagnetic field is created by a stationary axisymmetric plasma current and a set\nof rotating internal helical filamentary currents. The currents in the\nfilaments are adjusted to match the waveforms of the magnetic probes at the\nmid-plane and the rotating magnetic field is introduced as a perturbation to\nthe axisymmetric field obtained from a Grad-Shafranov equilibrium\nreconstruction code.\n", "  The derivation of Warburg's impedance presented in several books and\nscientific papers is reconsidered. It has been obtained by assuming that the\ntotal electric current across the sample is just due to the diffusion, and that\nthe external potential applied to the electrode is responsible for an increase\nof the bulk density of charge described by Nernst's model. We show that these\nassumptions are not correct, and hence the proposed derivations questionable. A\ncorrect determination of the electrochemical impedance of a cell of an\ninsulating material where are injected external charges of a given sign, when\nthe diffusion and the displacement currents are taken into account, does not\npredict, in the high frequency region, for the real and imaginary parts of the\nimpedance, the trends predicted by Warburg's impedance in the Nernstian\napproximation. The presented model can be generalized to the case of asymmetric\ncell, assuming boundary conditions physically sound.\n", "  We study the spontaneous temporal symmetry breaking instability in a\ncoherently-driven passive optical Kerr resonator observed experimentally by Xu\nand Coen in Opt.~Lett.~{\\bf 39}, 3492 (2014). We perform a detailed stability\nanalysis of the Lugiato-Lefever model for the optical Kerr resonators and\nanalyze the temporal bifurcation structure of stationary symmetric and the\nemerging asymmetric states as a function of the pump power. For intermediate\npump powers a pitchfork loop is responsible for the destabilization of\nsymmetric states towards stationary asymmetric ones while at large pump powers\nwe find the emergence of periodic asymmetric solutions via a Hopf bifurcation.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, we use local bifurcation theory in order to\nanalyze the most unstable eigenmode of the system. We also explore a\nnon-conservative variational approximation capturing, among others, the\nevolution of the solution's amplitude, width and center of mass. Both methods\nprovide insight towards the pitchfork bifurcations associated with the symmetry\nbreaking.\n", "  Quantum entanglement among multiple spatially separated particles is of\nfundamental interest, and can serve as central resources for studies in quantum\nnonlocality, quantum-to-classical transition, quantum error correction, and\nquantum simulation. The ability of generating an increasing number of entangled\nparticles is an important benchmark for quantum information processing. The\nlargest entangled states were previously created with fourteen trapped ions,\neight photons, and five superconducting qubits. Here, based on spontaneous\nparametric down-converted two-photon entanglement source with simultaneously a\nhigh brightness of ~12 MHz/W, a collection efficiency of ~70% and an\nindistinguishability of ~91% between independent photons, we demonstrate, for\nthe first time, genuine and distillable entanglement of ten single photons\nunder different pump power. Our work creates a state-of-the-art platform for\nmulti-photon experiments, and provide enabling technologies for challenging\noptical quantum information tasks such as high-efficiency scattershot boson\nsampling with many photons.\n", "  Entanglement, and, in particular the entanglement spectrum, plays a major\nrole in characterizing many-body quantum systems. While there has been a surge\nof theoretical works on the subject, no experimental measurement has been\nperformed to date because of the lack of an implementable measurement scheme.\nHere, we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of\nmany-body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. Our scheme\neffectively performs a Ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement Hamiltonian and\nis based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under\ninvestigation together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate\nbetween two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit. We show how\nthe required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms, either\nby using Rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode. We\nillustrate these ideas on a simple (extended) Bose-Hubbard model where such a\nmeasurement protocol reveals topological features of the Haldane phase.\n", "  We perform an analytical study of the energy and entanglement spectrum of\nnon-interacting fermionic bilayer honeycomb lattices in the presence of\ntrigonal warping in the energy spectrum, on-site energy difference and uniform\nmagnetic field. Employing single particle correlation functions, we present an\nexplicit form for layer-layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is\nentanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping,\nat zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between\nentanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of monolayer which means that the\nentanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the\nbilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect\ncorrespondence, however, in $\\Gamma$-K direction in hexagonal Brillouin zone,\ntheir behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping\nparameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of\nentanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We\nalso study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the\nentanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and\non-site energy difference. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum versus\nmagnetic flux has a self similar fractal structure, known Hofstadter butterfly.\nOur results also show that the on-site energy difference causes a transition\nfrom the Hofstadter butterfly to a tree-like picture.\n", "  Measuring transmission between four antennas in microwave cavities, we\ninvestigate directly the channel cross-correlations $C$ of the cross sections\n$\\sigma^{ab}$ from antenna at $\\vec{r}_a$ to antenna $\\vec{r}_b$. Specifically\nwe look for the $C_\\Sigma$ and $C_\\Lambda$, where the only difference is that\n$C_\\Lambda$ has none of the four channels in common, whereas $C_\\Sigma$ has\nexactly one channel in common. We find experimentally that these two channel\ncross-correlations are anti-phased as a function of the channel coupling\nstrength, as predicted by theory. This anti-correlation is essential to give\nthe correct values for the universal conductance fluctuations. To obtain a good\nagreement between experiment and predictions from random matrix theory the\neffect of absorption had to be included.\n", "  In the Leggett-Garg approach to testing macrorealism, the two-time\ncorrelation functions, which are normally obtained by sequential measurements\nof a dichotomic variable Q, need to be measured in a non-invasive way in order\nto exclude certain types of alternative classical explanation. Here, it is\nshown, for a class of macrorealistic theories, that the correlation functions\nare readily expressed in terms of a time integral of the velocity corresponding\nto Q and that this expression can be determined from a single final-time\nmeasurement of an auxiliary system in continual weak interaction with the\nprimary system. The protocol has the form of a \"waiting detector\" which clicks\nonly when Q changes sign. It shares features with both ideal negative\nmeasurements and weak measurements and we argue that it is essentially\nnon-invasive, under certain reasonable assumptions. We show that the\nnon-invasiveness persists to a quantum model of the process.\n", "  Increasing the imaging speed is a central aim in photoacoustic tomography.\nThis issue is especially important in the case of sequential scanning\napproaches as applied for most existing optical detection schemes. In this work\nwe address this issue using techniques of compressed sensing. We demonstrate,\nthat the number of measurements can significantly be reduced by allowing\ngeneral linear measurements instead of point-wise pressure values. A main\nrequirement in compressed sensing is the sparsity of the unknowns to be\nrecovered. For that purpose we develop the concept of sparsifying temporal\ntransforms for three-dimensional photoacoustic tomography. We establish a\ntwo-stage algorithm that recovers the complete pressure Signals in a first step\nand then applies a standard reconstruction algorithm such as back-projection.\nThis yields a novel reconstruction method with much lower complexity than\nexisting compressed sensing approaches for photoacoustic tomography.\nReconstruction results for simulated and for experimental data verify that the\nproposed compressed sensing scheme allows to significantly reducing the number\nof spatial measurements without reducing the spatial resolution.\n", "  We discuss the statistics of emission of photons by a single atom or ion\nilluminated by a laser beam at the frequency of quasi-resonance between two\nenergy levels, a situation that corresponds to real experiments. We extend this\nto the case of two laser beams resonant with the energy differences between two\nexcited levels and the ground state (three level atom in V-configuration). We\nuse a novel approach of this type of problem by considering Kolmogorov equation\nfor the probability distribution of the atomic state which takes into account\nfirst the deterministic evolution of this state under the effect of the\nincoming laser beam and the random emission of photons during the spontaneous\ndecay of the excited state(s) to the ground state. This approach yields\nsolvable equations in the two level atom case. For the three level atom case we\nset the problem and define clearly its frame. The results obtained are valid\nboth in the opposite limits of rare and of frequent spontaneous decay, compared\nto the period of the optical Rabi oscillations due to the interaction between\nthe resonant excitation and the atomic levels. Our theory gives access to\nvarious statistical properties of the fluorescence light, including one showing\nthat its fluctuations in time are not invariants under time reversal. This\nresult puts in evidence the fundamentally irreversible character of quantum\nmeasurements, represented here by the emission of photons of fluorescence.\n", "  Vector boson scattering is (together with the production of multiple\nelectroweak gauge bosons) the key process in the current run 2 of LHC to probe\nthe microscopic nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. Deviations from the\nStandard Model are generically parameterized by higher-dimensional operators,\nhowever, there is a subtle issue of perturbative unitarity for such approaches\nfor the process above. We discuss a parameter-free unitarization prescription\nto get physically meaningful predictions. In the second part, we construct\nsimplified models for generic new resonances that can appear in vector boson\nscattering, with a special focus on the technicalities of tensor resonances.\n", "  Over recent years, a lot of progress has been achieved in understanding of\nthe relationship between localization and transport of energy in essentially\nnonlinear oscillatory systems. In this paper we are going to demonstrate that\nthe structure of the resonance manifold can be conveniently described in terms\nof canonical action-angle variables. Such formalism has important theoretical\nadvantages: all resonance manifolds may be described at the same level of\ncomplexity, appearance of additional conservation laws on these manifolds is\neasily proven both in autonomous and non-autonomous settings. The harmonic\nbalance - based complexification approach, used in many previous studies on the\nsubject, is shown to be a particular case of the canonical formalism. Moreover,\napplication of the canonic averaging allows treatment of much broader variety\nof dynamical models. As an example, energy exchanges in systems of coupled\ntrigonometrical and vibro-impact oscillators are considered.\n", "  Dynamics of array of coupled self-excited oscillators is considered. Model of\nFranklin bell is adopted as a mechanism for the self-excitation. The model\nallows derivation of exact analytic solutions for discrete breathers (DBs), and\nextensive exploration of their stability in the space of parameters. The DB\nsolutions exist for all frequencies in the attenuation zone, but lose stability\nvia Neimark-Sacker bifurcation near the boundary of propagation zone. Besides\nthe well-known DBs with exponential localization, the considered system\npossesses additional and novel type of solutions - discrete breathers with main\nfrequency in the propagation zone of the chain. The amplitude of oscillations\nin this solution is maximal at the localization site and then exponentially\napproaches constant value at infinity. We also derive these solutions in closed\nanalytic form. They are stable in a narrow region of system parameters bounded\nby Neimark-Sacker and pitchfork bifurcations.\n", "  Lysov, Pasterski and Strominger have shown how Low's subleading soft photon\ntheorem can be understood as Ward identities of new symmetries of massless QED.\nIn this paper we offer a different perspective and show that there exists a\nclass of large $U(1)$ gauge transformations such that (i) the associated\n(electric and magnetic) charges can be computed from first principles (ii)\ntheir Ward identities are equivalent to Low's theorem. Our framework paves the\nway to analyze the sub-subleading theorem in gravity in terms of Ward\nidentities associated to large diffeomorphisms.\n", "  We consider a simple extension of the Standard Model with a scalar top-philic\nDark Matter (DM) $S$ coupling, apart from the Higgs portal, exclusively to the\nright-handed top quark $t_R$ and a colored vector-like top partner $T$ with a\nYukawa coupling $y_{ST}$ which we call the topVL portal. When the Higgs portal\nis closed and $y_{ST}$ is perturbative $ (\\lesssim 1)$, $TS\\to (W^+b, gt)$,\n$SS\\to t\\bar{t}$ and $T\\bar{T}\\to (q\\bar{q},gg)$ provide the dominant\n(co)annihilation contributions to obtain $\\Omega_{\\rm DM} h^2\\simeq 0.12$ in\nlight, medium and heavy DM mass range, respectively. However, large\n$y_{ST}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10)$ can make $SS\\to gg$ dominate via the loop-induced\ncoupling $C_{SSgg}$ in the $m_S<m_t$ region. In this model it is the $C_{SSgg}$\ncoupling that generates DM-nucleon scattering in the direct detection, which\ncan be large and simply determined by $\\Omega_{\\rm DM} h^2\\simeq 0.12$ when\n$SS\\to gg$ dominates the DM annihilation. The current LUX results can exclude\nthe $SS\\to gg$ dominating scenario and XENON-1T experiment may further test\n$y_{ST}\\gtrsim 1$, and $0.5\\lesssim y_{ST}\\lesssim 1$ may be covered in the\nfuture LUX-ZP experiment. The current indirect detection results from Fermi\ngamma-ray observations can also exclude the $SS\\to gg$ dominating scenario and\nare sensitive to the heavy DM mass region, of which the improved sensitivity by\none order will push DM mass to be above 400, 600, 1000 GeV for $y_{ST}=0.3,\n0.5, 1.0$, respectively. $T\\bar{T}$ pair produced at the hadron collider will\ndecay $100\\%$ into $t\\bar{t}+E^{miss}_T$ signal when kinematically open. The\nlatest ATLAS 13 TeV 13.2 $\\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ data can excluded $m_T$ between 300\n(650) and 1150 (1100) GeV for $m_S$ =40 (400) GeV and the exclusion region can\nreach up to $m_S\\sim 500$ GeV.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the combined effects of Sr substitution and\nhydrostatic pressure on the ground-state properties of CaFe$_2$As$_2$.\nMeasurements of the electrical resistance and magnetic susceptibility, both at\nambient and finite pressure $P$ $\\leq$ 2$\\,$GPa, were performed on\nCa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals grown out of Sn flux. We find that\nupon Sr substitution the ranges of stability of both the structural-magnetic\ntransition and the transition into the non-magnetic collapsed tetragonal phase\nare shifted to higher pressure levels with the latter moving at a higher rate.\nThis suggests the possibility of separating the two phase lines, which\nintersect already at elevated temperatures for $x$ = 0 and low Sr concentration\nlevels. For $x$ = 0.177 we find strong evidence that both phases remain\nseparated down to lowest temperature and that a zero-resistance state emerges\nin this intermediate pressure window. This observation indicates that\nSr-substitution combined with hydrostatic pressure provides another route for\nstabilizing superconductivity in CaFe$_2$As$_2$. Our results are consistent\nwith the notion that (i) preserving the fluctuations associated with the\nstructural-magnetic transition to low temperatures is vital for\nsuperconductivity to form in this material and that (ii) the non-magnetic\ncollapsed tetragonal phase is detrimental for superconductivity.\n", "  The interplay between electronic eigenstates, spin, and orbital degrees of\nfreedom, combined with fundamental breaking of symmetries is currently one of\nthe most exciting fields of research. Multiferroics such as (GeMn)Te fulfill\nthese requirements providing unusual physical properties due to the coexistence\nand coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order in one and the same\nsystem. Here we show that multiferroic (GeMn)Te inherits from its parent\nferroelectric {\\alpha}-GeTe compound a giant Rashba splitting of\nthree-dimensional bulk states which competes with the Zeeman spin splitting\ninduced by the magnetic exchange interactions. The collinear alignment of\nferroelectric and ferromagnetic polarization leads to an opening of a tunable\nZeeman gap of up to 100 meV around the Dirac point of the Rashba bands, coupled\nwith a change in spin texture by entanglement of magnetic and spin-orbit order.\nThrough applications of magnetic fields, we demonstrate manipulation of spin-\ntexture by spin resolved photoemission experiments, which is also expected for\nelectric fields based on the multiferroic coupling. The control of spin\nhelicity of the bands and its locking to ferromagnetic and ferroelectric order\nopens fascinating new avenues for highly multifunctional multiferroic Rashba\ndevices suited for reprogrammable logic and/or nonvolatile memory applications.\n", "  [Abridged] We present a robust measurement of the rest-frame UV luminosity\nfunction (LF) and its evolution during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation\nat 1<z<3. We use our deep near ultraviolet imaging from WFC3/UVIS on the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) and existing ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR imaging of three lensing\ngalaxy clusters, Abell 2744 and MACSJ0717 from the Hubble Frontier Field survey\nand Abell 1689. We use photometric redshifts to identify 780 ultra-faint\ngalaxies with $M_{UV}$<-12.5 AB mag at 1<z<3. From these samples, we identified\n5 new, faint, multiply imaged systems in A1689. We compute the rest-frame UV LF\nand find the best-fit faint-end slopes of $\\alpha=-1.56\\pm0.04$,\n$\\alpha=-1.72\\pm0.04$ and $\\alpha=-1.94\\pm0.06$ at 1.0<z<1.6, 1.6<z<2.2 and\n2.2<z<3.0, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the UV LF becomes steeper\nfrom z\\sim1.3 to z\\sim2.6 with no sign of a turnover down to $M_{UV}=-14$ AB\nmag. We further derive the UV LFs using the Lyman break \"dropout\" selection and\nconfirm the robustness of our conclusions against different selection\nmethodologies. Because the sample sizes are so large, and extend to such faint\nluminosities, the statistical uncertainties are quite small, and systematic\nuncertainties (due to the assumed size distribution, for example), likely\ndominate. If we restrict our analysis to galaxies and volumes above > 50%\ncompleteness in order to minimize these systematics, we still find that the\nfaint-end slope is steep and getting steeper with redshift, though with\nslightly shallower (less negative) values ($\\alpha=-1.55\\pm0.06$,\n$-1.69\\pm0.07$ and $-1.79\\pm0.08$ for $z\\sim1.3$, 1.9 and 2.6, respectively).\nFinally, we conclude that the faint star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of\n$-18.5<M_{UV}<-12.5$ covered in this study, produce the majority (55%-60%) of\nthe unobscured UV luminosity density at 1<z<3.\n", "  The integration of two-dimensional materials such as transition metal\ndichalcogenides with bulk semiconductors offer interesting opportunities for\n2D/3D heterojunction-based novel device structures without any constraints of\nlattice matching. By exploiting the favorable band alignment at the GaN/MoS2\nheterojunction, an Esaki interband tunnel diode is demonstrated by transferring\nlarge area, Nb-doped, p-type MoS2 onto heavily n-doped GaN. A peak current\ndensity of 446 A/cm2 with repeatable room temperature negative differential\nresistance, peak to valley current ratio of 1.2, and minimal hysteresis was\nmeasured in the MoS2/GaN non-epitaxial tunnel diode. A high current density of\n1 kA/cm2 was measured in the Zener mode (reverse bias) at -1 V bias. The\nGaN/MoS2 tunnel junction was also modeled by treating MoS2 as a bulk\nsemiconductor, and the electrostatics at the 2D/3D interface was found to be\ncrucial in explaining the experimentally observed device characteristics.\n", "  Ultracold neutron (UCN) storage measurements were made in a trap constructed\nfrom a 1.3 T Halbach Octupole PErmanent (HOPE) magnet array aligned vertically,\nusing the TES-port of the PF2 source at the Institut Laue-Langevin. A\nmechanical UCN valve at the bottom of the trap was used for filling and\nemptying. This valve was covered with Fomblin grease to induce non-specular\nreflections and was used in combination with a movable polyethylene UCN remover\ninserted from the top for cleaning of above-threshold UCNs. Loss due to UCN\ndepolarization was suppressed with a minimum 2 mT bias field. Without using the\nUCN remover, a total storage time constant of $(712 \\pm 19)$ s was observed;\nwith the remover inserted for 80 s and used at either 80 cm or 65 cm from the\nbottom of the trap, time constants of $(824 \\pm 32)$ s and $(835 \\pm 36)$ s\nwere observed. Combining the latter two values, a neutron lifetime of\n$\\tau_{\\rm n} = (887 \\pm 39)$ s is extracted after primarily correcting for\nlosses at the UCN valve. The time constants of the UCN population during\ncleaning were observed and compared to calculations based on UCN kinetic theory\nas well as Monte-Carlo studies. These calculations are used to predict\nabove-threshold populations of $\\sim 5\\%$, $\\sim 0.5\\%$ and $\\sim 10^{-12}\\%$\nremaining after cleaning in the no remover, 80~cm remover and 65~cm remover\nmeasurements. Thus, by using a non-specular reflector covering the entire\nbottom of the trap and a remover at the top of the trap, we have established an\neffective cleaning procedure for removing a major systematic effect in\nhigh-precision $\\tau_{\\rm n}$ experiments with magnetically stored UCNs.\n", "  The recent discovery of merging black holes suggests that a stochastic\ngravitational-wave background is within reach of the advanced detector network\noperating at design sensitivity. However, correlated magnetic noise from\nSchumann resonances threatens to contaminate observation of a stochastic\nbackground. In this paper, we report on the first effort to eliminate\nintercontinental correlated noise from Schumann resonances using Wiener\nfiltering. Using magnetometers as proxies for gravitational-wave detectors, we\ndemonstrate as much as a factor of two reduction in the coherence between\nmagnetometers on different continents. While much work remains to be done, our\nresults constitute a proof-of-principle and motivate follow-up studies with a\ndedicated array of magnetometers.\n", "  The origin of the high-temperature superconducting state observed in FeSe\nthin films, whose phase diagram displays no sign of magnetic order, remains a\nhotly debated topic. Here we investigate whether fluctuations arising due to\nthe proximity to a nematic phase, which is observed in the phase diagram of\nthis material, can promote superconductivity. We find that nematic fluctuations\nalone promote a highly degenerate pairing state, in which both $s$-wave and\n$d$-wave symmetries are equally favored, and $T_{c}$ is consequently\nsuppressed. However, the presence of a sizable spin-orbit coupling or inversion\nsymmetry-breaking at the film interface lifts this harmful degeneracy and\nselects the $s$-wave state, in agreement with recent experimental proposals.\nThe resulting gap function displays a weak anisotropy, which agrees with\nexperiments in monolayer FeSe and intercalated Li$_{1-x}$(OH)$_{x}$FeSe.\n", "  Erosion shapes our landscape and occurs when a sufficient shear stress is\nexerted by a fluid on a sedimented layer. What controls erosion at a\nmicroscopic level remains debated, especially near the threshold forcing where\nit stops. Here we study experimentally the collective dynamics of the moving\nparticles, using a set-up where the system spontaneously evolves toward the\nerosion onset. We find that the spatial organization of the erosion flux is\nheterogeneous in space, and occurs along channels of local flux $\\sigma$ whose\ndistribution displays scaling near threshold and follows $P(\\sigma)\\sim\nJ/\\sigma$, where $J$ is the mean erosion flux. Channels are strongly correlated\nin the direction of forcing but not in the transverse direction. We show that\nthese results quantitatively agree with a model where the dynamics is governed\nby the competition of disorder (which channels mobile particles) and particle\ninteractions (which reduces channeling). These observations support that for\nlaminar flows, erosion is a dynamical phase transition which shares similarity\nwith the plastic depinning transition occurring in dirty superconductors. The\nmethodology we introduce here could be applied to probe these systems as well.\n", "  The native oxide at the surface of III-V nanowires, such as InAs, can be a\nmajor source of charge noise and scattering in nanowire-based electronics,\nparticularly for quantum devices operated at low temperatures. Surface\npassivation provides a means to remove the native oxide and prevent its\nregrowth. Here, we study the effects of surface passivation and conformal\ndielectric deposition by measuring electrical conductance through nanowire\nfield effect transistors treated with a variety of surface preparations. By\nextracting field effect mobility, subthreshold swing, threshold shift with\ntemperature, and the gate hysteresis for each device, we infer the relative\neffects of the different treatments on the factors influencing transport. It is\nfound that a combination of chemical passivation followed by deposition of an\naluminum oxide dielectric shell yields the best results compared to the other\ntreatments, and comparable to untreated nanowires. Finally, it is shown that an\nentrenched, top-gated device using an optimally treated nanowire can\nsuccessfully form a stable double quantum dot at low temperatures. The device\nhas excellent electrostatic tunability owing to the conformal dielectric layer\nand the combination of local top gates and a global back gate.\n", "  We investigate phase separation including elastic coherency effects in the\nbulk and at surfaces and find a reduction of the solubility limit in the\npresence of free surfaces. This mechanism favours phase separation near free\nsurfaces even in the absence of external stresses. We apply the theory to\nhydride formation in nickel, iron and niobium and obtain a reduction of the\nsolubility limit by up to two orders of magnitude at room temperature in the\npresence of free surfaces. These effects are concisely expressed through a\nsolubility modification factor, which transparently expresses the long-ranged\nelastic effects in a terminology accessible e.g. to ab initio calculations.\n", "  We introduce a new type of the spacetime quantization based on the spinorial\ndescription suggested by loop quantum gravity. Specifically, we build our\ntheory on a string theory inspired $Spin(3,1)$ worldsheet action. Because of\nits connection with quantum gravity theories, our proposal may in principle\nlink back to string theory, connect to loop quantum gravity where $SU(2)$ is\nsuggested as the fundamental symmetry, or serve as a Lorentzian spin network.\nWe derive the generalized uncertainty principle and demonstrate the holographic\nnature of our theory. Due to the quantization of spacetime, geodesics in our\ntheory are fuzzy, but the fuzziness is shown to be much below conceivable\nastrophysical bounds.\n", "  We report a stable double optical spring effect in an optical cavity pumped\nwith a single optical field that arises as a result of birefringence. One end\nof the cavity is formed by a multilayer Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As/GaAs stack\nsupported by a microfabricated cantilever, with a natural mode frequency of\n$274$ Hz. The optical spring shifts the resonance to $21$ kHz, corresponding to\na suppression of low frequency vibrations by a factor of more than $10^{4}$.\nThe stable nature of the optical trap allows the cavity to be operated without\nany external feedback and with only a single optical field incident.\n", "  By studying the t-J model for superconductivity, the Pati-Salam model and the\nHaplon model for particle unifications, we extract their common feature which\nis the spin-charge separation of fermions. This becomes a de-gauging process\nfor charged fermions by considering them as bound states of a neutral fermion\nand charged or neutral bosons. We present a few examples including the\nweak-charge-spin separation for the leptons in the Standard Model. Some\nfundamental fermions can be obtained by continuing this de-gauging process for\ndifferent kinds of charges. Finally the binding forces of the bound states\nmight be provided by interactions related to spacetime symmetries such as\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  We point out that the recent conjectural solution to the spectral problem for\nthe Hamiltonian $H=e^{x}+e^{-x}+e^{p}+e^{-p}$ in terms of the refined\ntopological invariants of a local Calabi-Yau geometry has an intimate relation\nwith two-dimensional non-interacting electrons moving in a periodic potential\nunder a uniform magnetic field. In particular, we find that the quantum\nA-period, determining the relation between the energy eigenvalue and the Kahler\nmodulus of the Calabi-Yau, can be found explicitly when the quantum parameter\n$q=e^{i\\hbar}$ is a root of unity, that its branch cuts are given by\nHofstadter's butterfly, and that its imaginary part counts the number of states\nof the Hofstadter Hamiltonian. The modular double operation, exchanging $\\hbar$\nand $4\\pi^2/\\hbar$, plays an important role.\n", "  The unicellular biflagellate green alga {\\it Chlamydomonas reinhardtii} has\nbeen an important model system in biology for decades, and in recent years it\nhas started to attract growing attention also within the biophysics community.\nHere we provide a concise review of some of the aspects of {\\it Chlamydomonas}\nbiology and biophysics most immediately relevant to physicists that might be\ninterested in starting to work with this versatile microorganism.\n", "  Building on earlier work in the high energy and condensed matter communities,\nwe present a web of dualities in $2+1$ dimensions that generalize the known\nparticle/vortex duality. Some of the dualities relate theories of fermions to\ntheories of bosons. Others relate different theories of fermions. For example,\nthe long distance behavior of the $2+1$-dimensional analog of QED with a single\nDirac fermion (a theory known as $U(1)_{1/2}$) is identified with the $O(2)$\nWilson-Fisher fixed point. The gauged version of that fixed point with a\nChern-Simons coupling at level one is identified as a free Dirac fermion. The\nlatter theory also has a dual version as a fermion interacting with some gauge\nfields. Assuming some of these dualities, other dualities can be derived. Our\nanalysis resolves a number of confusing issues in the literature including how\ntime reversal is realized in these theories. It also has many applications in\ncondensed matter physics like the theory of topological insulators (and their\ngapped boundary states) and the problem of electrons in the lowest Landau level\nat half filling. (Our techniques also clarify some points in the fractional\nHall effect and its description using flux attachment.) In addition to\npresenting several consistency checks, we also present plausible (but not\nrigorous) derivations of the dualities and relate them to $3+1$-dimensional\n$S$-duality.\n", "  It is a challenge for Phase Measurement Profilometry (PMP) to measure objects\nwith a large range of reflectivity variation across the surface. Saturated or\ndark pixels in the deformed fringe patterns captured by the camera will lead to\nphase fluctuations and errors. Jiang et al. proposed a high dynamic range\nreal-time 3D shape measurement method without changing camera exposures. Three\ninverted phase-shifted fringe patterns are used to complement three regular\nphase-shifted fringe patterns for phase retrieval when any of the regular\nfringe patterns are saturated. But Jiang's method still has some drawbacks: (1)\nThe phases in saturated pixels are respectively estimated by different formulas\nfor different cases. It is shortage of an universal formula; (2) it cannot be\nextended to four-step phase-shifting algorithm because inverted fringe patterns\nare the repetition of regular fringe patterns; (3) only three unsaturated\nintensity values at every pixel of fringe patterns are chosen for phase\ndemodulation, lying idle the other unsaturated ones. We proposed a method for\nenhanced high dynamic range 3D shape measurement based on generalized\nphase-shifting algorithm, which combines the complementary technique of\ninverted and regular fringe patterns with generalized phase-shifting algorithm.\nFirstly, two sets of complementary phase-shifted fringe patterns, namely\nregular and inverted fringe patterns are projected and collected. Then all\nunsaturated intensity values at the same camera pixel from two sets of fringe\npatterns are selected, and employed to retrieve the phase by generalized\nphase-shifting algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to\nprove the validity of the proposed method. The results are analyzed and\ncompared with Jiang's method, which demonstrate that the proposed method not\nonly expands the scope of Jiang's method, but also improves the measurement\naccuracy.\n", "  We discuss non-renormalization theorems applying to galileon field theories\nand their generalizations. Galileon theories are similar in many respects to\nother derivatively coupled effective field theories, including general\nrelativity and $P(X)$ theories. In particular, these other theories also enjoy\nversions of non-renormalization theorems that protect certain operators against\ncorrections from self-loops. However, we argue that the galileons are\ndistinguished by the fact that they are not renormalized even by loops of other\nheavy fields whose couplings respect the galileon symmetry.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian version of a $\\cal PT$-symmetric lattice that\ndescribes dynamics of coupled pendula under a resonant periodic force. Using\nthe asymptotic limit of a weak coupling between the pendula, we prove the\nnonlinear long-time stability of breathers (time-periodic solutions localized\nin the lattice) by using the Lyapunov method. Breathers are saddle points of\nthe extended energy function, which are located between the continuous bands of\npositive and negative energy. Nevertheless, we construct an approximate\nLyapunov function and estimate its evolution on a long but finite time\ninterval. The nonlinear stability analysis becomes possible for the $\\cal\nPT$-symmetric lattice only because of the existence of a Hamiltonian structure.\n", "  Anisotropic flow is an important observable in the study of the Quark-Gluon\nPlasma that is expected to be formed in heavy-ion collisions. With a multiphase\ntransport (AMPT) model we investigate the elliptic($\\emph{v}_{2}$),\ntriangular($\\emph{v}_{3}$), and quadrangular($\\emph{v}_{4}$) flow of charged\nparticles in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Then We\ncompare our flow results with the published ALICE flow results. We found our\nAMPT simulated results are consistent with ALICE experimental data.\n", "  The solution of third order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian of simple cubic\nferromagnetic ultra-thin films with three layers were found. All the magnetic\nenergy parameters such as spin exchange interaction, magnetic dipole\ninteraction, second order magnetic anisotropy, fourth order magnetic\nanisotropy, applied magnetic field, demagnetization factor and stress induced\nanisotropy were included in the third order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian.\n3-D plots of stress induced anisotropy, out of plane magnetic field,\ndemagnetization factor and spin exchange interaction are presented in this\nmanuscript. Magnetic easy and hard directions were determined using these 3-D\nplots. MATLAB program was employed to solve the equation with seven parameters.\n", "  The SwissFEL Injector Test Facility operated at the Paul Scherrer Institute\nbetween 2010 and 2014, serving as a pilot plant and testbed for the development\nand realization of SwissFEL, the X-ray Free-Electron Laser facility under\nconstruction at the same institute. The test facility consisted of a\nlaser-driven rf electron gun followed by an S-band booster linac, a magnetic\nbunch compression chicane and a diagnostic section including a transverse\ndeflecting rf cavity. It delivered electron bunches of up to 200 pC charge and\nup to 250 MeV beam energy at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The measurements\nperformed at the test facility not only demonstrated the beam parameters\nrequired to drive the first stage of an FEL facility, but also led to\nsignificant advances in instrumentation technologies, beam characterization\nmethods and the generation, transport and compression of ultra-low-emittance\nbeams. We give a comprehensive overview of the commissioning experience of the\nprincipal subsystems and the beam physics measurements performed during the\noperation of the test facility, including the results of the test of an\nin-vacuum undulator prototype generating radiation in the vacuum ultraviolet\nand optical range.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the influence of a screw dislocation on the\nenergy levels and the wavefunctions of an electron confined in a\ntwo-dimensional pseudoharmonic quantum dot under the influence of an external\nmagnetic field inside a dot and Aharonov-Bohm field inside a pseudodot. The\nexact solutions for energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions are computed as\nfunctions of applied uniform magnetic field strength, Aharonov-Bohm flux,\nmagnetic quantum number and the parameter characterizing the screw dislocation,\nthe Burgers vector. We investigate the modifications due to the screw\ndislocation on the light interband absorption coefficient and absorption\nthreshold frequency. Two scenarios are possible, depending on if singular\neffects either manifest or not. We found that as the Burgers vector increases,\nthe curves of frequency are pushed up towards of the growth of it. One\ninteresting aspect which we have observed is that the Aharonov-Bohm flux can be\ntuned in order to cancel the screw effect of the model.\n", "  The spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect has been known to be profound in\nmonolayer pristine transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here we show that\npoint defects, which are omnipresent in the TMD membranes, exhibit even\nstronger SOC effects and change the physics of the host materials drastically.\nIn this Article we chose the representative monolayer WS\\sub{2} slabs from the\nTMD family together with seven typical types of point defects including\nmonovacancies, interstitials, and antisites. We calculated the formation\nenergies of these defects, and studied the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\non the corresponding defect states. We found that the S monovacancy (V\\sub{S} )\nand S interstitial (adatom) have the lowest formation energies. In the case of\nV\\sub{S} and both of the W\\sub{S and W\\sub{S2} antisites, the defect states\nexhibit giant splitting up to 296 meV when SOC is considered. Depending on the\nrelative position of the defect state with respect to the conduction band\nminimum (CBM), the hybrid functional HSE will either increase the splitting by\nup to 60 meV (far from CBM), or decrease the splitting by up to 57 meV (close\nto CBM). Furthermore, we found that both the W\\sub{S} and W\\sub{S2} antisites\npossess a magnetic moment of 2 $\\mu_{B}$ localized at the antisite W atom and\nthe neighboring W atoms. All these findings provide new insights in the defect\nbehavior under SOC point to new possibilities for spintronics applications for\nTMDs.\n", "  Various theoretical calculations based on QCD or hadronic interactions\npredict that in addition to the recently observed dibaryon resonance\n$d^*(2380)$ with $I(J^P) = 0(3^+)$ there should also exist a dibaryon resonance\nwith mirrored quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 3(0^+)$. We report here on a search for\nsuch a $NN$-decoupled state in data on the $pp \\to pp\\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^-$\nreaction. Since no clear-cut evidence has been found, we give upper limits for\nthe production cross section of such a resonance in the mass range 2280 - 2500\nMeV.\n", "  We discuss an extension of the instanton-dyon liquid model that includes\ntwisted light quarks in the fundamental representation with explicit $Z_{N_c}$\nsymmetry for the case with equal number of colors $N_c$ and flavors $N_f$. We\nmap the model on a 3-dimensional quantum effective theory, and analyze it in\nthe mean-field approximation. The effective potential and the vacuum chiral\ncondensates are made explicit for $N_f=N_c=2, 3$. The low temperature phase is\ncenter symmetric but breaks spontaneously flavor symmetry with $N_f-1$ massless\npions. The high temperature phase breaks center symmetry but supports finite\nand unequal quark condensates.\n", "  The ratio of heat and salt flux is employed in ice-ocean models to represent\nice-ocean interactions. In this study, this flux ratio is determined from\ndirect numerical simulations of free convection beneath a melting, horizontal,\nsmooth ice-ocean interface. We find that the flux ratio at the interface is\nthree times as large as previously assessed based on turbulent-flux\nmeasurements in the field. As a consequence, interface salinities and melt\nrates are overestimated by up to 40\\% if they are based on the three-equation\nformulation. We also find that the interface flux ratio depends only very\nweakly on the far-field conditions of the flow. Lastly, our simulations\nindicate that estimates of the interface flux ratio based on direct\nmeasurements of the turbulent fluxes will be difficult because at the interface\nthe diffusivities alone determine the mixing and the flux ratio varies with\ndepth. As an alternative, we present a consistent evaluation of the flux ratio\nbased on the total heat and salt fluxes across the boundary layer and reconcile\nthe determinations of the ice-ocean interface conditions.\n", "  We consider a recent $T$-matrix analysis by Albaladejo {\\it et al.}, [Phys.\\\nLett.\\ B {\\bf 755}, 337 (2016)] which accounts for the $J/\\psi\\pi$ and\n$D^\\ast\\bar{D}$ coupled--channels dynamics, and that successfully describes the\nexperimental information concerning the recently discovered $Z_c(3900)^\\pm$.\nWithin such scheme, the data can be similarly well described in two different\nscenarios, where the $Z_c(3900)$ is either a resonance or a virtual state. To\nshed light into the nature of this state, we apply this formalism in a finite\nbox with the aim of comparing with recent Lattice QCD (LQCD) simulations. We\nsee that the energy levels obtained for both scenarios agree well with those\nobtained in the single-volume LQCD simulation reported in Prelovsek {\\it et\nal.} [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ D {\\bf 91}, 014504 (2015)], making thus difficult to\ndisentangle between both possibilities. We also study the volume dependence of\nthe energy levels obtained with our formalism, and suggest that LQCD\nsimulations performed at several volumes could help in discerning the actual\nnature of the intriguing $Z_c(3900)$ state.\n", "  The ability of gas-surface dynamics studies to resolve the velocity\ndistribution of the scattered species in the 2D sacattering plane has been\nlimited by technical capabilities and only a few different approaches have been\nexplored in recent years. In comparison, gas-phase scattering studies have been\ntransformed by the near ubiquitous use of velocity map imaging. We describe an\ninnovative means of introducing a surface within the electric field of a\ntypical velocity map imaging experiment. The retention of optimum velocity\nmapping conditions was demonstrated by measurements of iodomethane-d3\nphotodissociation and SIMION calculations. To demonstrate the systems\ncapabilities the velocity distributions of ammonia molecules scattered from a\nPTFE surface have been measured for multiple product rotational states.\n", "  Starting from a molecular picture for the X(3872) resonance, this state and\nits J^{PC}=2++ HQSS partner [X2(4012)] are analyzed within a model which\nincorporates possible mixings with 2P charmonium states. Since it is reasonable\nto expect the bare chi_{c1}(2P) to be located above the D\\bar D* threshold, but\nrelatively close to it, the presence of the charmonium state provides an\neffective attraction that will contribute to bind the X(3872), but it will not\nappear in the 2++ sector. Indeed in this latter sector, the chi_{c2}(2P) should\nprovide an effective small repulsion, because it is placed well below the\nD*\\bar D* threshold. We show how the 1++ and 2++ bare charmonium poles are\nmodified due to the D(*)\\bar D(*) loop effects, and the first one is moved to\nthe complex plane. The meson loops produce, besides some shifts in the masses\nof the charmonia, a finite width for the 1++ dressed charmonium state. On the\nother hand, the X(3872) and X2(4012) start developing some charmonium content,\nwhich is estimated by means of the compositeness Weinberg sum-rule. We also\nshow that for X(3872) molecular probabilities of around 70-90 %, the X2\nresonance destabilizes and disappears from the spectrum, becoming either a\nvirtual state or being located deep into the complex plane, with decreasing\ninfluence in the D* \\bar D* scattering line.\n", "  Socio-economic inequality is characterized from data using various indices.\nThe Gini ($g$) index, giving the overall inequality is the most common one,\nwhile the recently introduced Kolkata ($k$) index gives a measure of $1-k$\nfraction of population who possess top $k$ fraction of wealth in the society.\nHere, we show the relationship between the two indices, using both empirical\ndata and analytical estimates. The significance of their relationship has been\ndiscussed.\n", "  Periodic orbits for the classical $\\phi^4$ theory on the one dimensional\nlattice are systematically constructed by extending the normal modes of the\nharmonic theory, for periodic, fixed and free boundary conditions. Through the\nprocess, we clarify, in general, which normal modes of the linear theory can or\ncan not be extended to the full non-linear theory. We then analyze the\nstability of these orbits, clarifying the link between the stability,\nparametric resonance and the Lyapunov spectra for these orbits.The construction\nof the periodic orbits and the stability analysis is applicable to theories\ngoverned by Hamiltonians with quadratic inter-site potentials and a general\non-site potential. We also apply the analysis to theories with on-site\npotentials that have qualitatively different behavior from the $\\phi^4$ theory,\nwith some concrete examples.\n", "  We determine the reality conditions on the string fields that make the action\nfor heterotic and type II string field theories real.\n", "  Base roughness plays an important role to the dynamics of granular flows but\nis yet poorly understood due to the difficulty of its quantification. For a\nbumpy base made by spheres, at least two factors should be considered to\ncharacterize its geometric roughness, namely the size ratio of base- to\nflow-particles and the packing of base particles. In this paper, we propose a\ndefinition of base roughness, Ra, which is a function of both the size ratio\nand the packing arrangement of base particles. The function is generalized for\nrandom and regular packing of multi-layered spheres, where the range of\npossible values of Ra is studied, along with the optimal values to create\nmaximum base roughness. The new definition is applied to granular flows down\nchute in both two- and three-dimensional configurations. It is proven to be a\ngood indicator of slip condi- tion, and a transition occurs from slip to\nnon-slip condition as Ra increases. Critical values of Ra are identified for\nthe construction of a non-slip base. The effects of contact parameters on base\nvelocity are studied, and it is shown that while the coefficient of friction is\nless influential, normal damping has more profound effect on base velocity at\nlower values of Ra. The application of present definition to other base\ngeometries is also discussed.\n", "  Nonlinear guided wave modes in an asymmetric slab waveguide formed by an\nisotropic dielectric layer placed on a linear or nonlinear substrate and\ncovered by a hyperbolic material are investigated. Optical axis is normal to\nthe slab plane. The dispersion relations for TM waves are found. It is shown\nthat there are additional cut-off frequencies for each TM mode. The effects of\nthe nonlinearity on the dispersion relations are investigated and discussed.\nThere are the modes, which are corresponded with situation where the peak of\nelectric field is localized in the nonlinear substrate. These modes are absent\nin the linear waveguide. To excite these modes the power must exceed certain\nthreshold value.\n", "  The neutron matter equation of state is calculated from two-neutron forces up\nto fifth order of the chiral expansion and the order-by-order convergence of\nthe predictions is investigated. Based on these equations of state, the binding\nenergies and the neutron and proton density distributions in 208Pb and 48Ca are\nderived, with particular attention to the neutron skins, the focal point of\nthis paper. Anticipating future experiments which will provide reliable\ninformation on the weak charge density in nuclei, the theoretical uncertainties\nand the possibility of constraining the size of few-neutron forces in neutron\nmatter are discussed.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are predicted to realize the three-dimensional axial anomaly\nfirst discussed in particle physics. The anomaly leads to unusual transport\nphenomena such as the chiral magnetic effect in which an applied magnetic field\ninduces a current parallel to the field. Here we investigate diagnostics of the\naxial anomaly based on the fundamental equations of axion electrodynamics. We\nfind that materials with Weyl nodes of opposite chirality and finite energy\nseparation immersed in a uniform magnetic field exhibit an anomaly-induced\noscillatory magnetic field with a period set by the chemical potential\ndifference of the nodes. In the case where a chemical potential imbalance is\ncreated by applying parallel electric and magnetic fields, we find a\nsuppression of the magnetic field component parallel to the electric field\ninside the material for rectangular samples, suggesting that the chiral\nmagnetic current opposes this imbalance. For cylindrical geometries, we instead\nfind an enhancement of this magnetic field component along with an\nanomaly-induced azimuthal component. We propose experiments to detect such\nmagnetic signatures of the axial anomaly.\n", "  Collections of interacting, self-propelled particles have been extensively\nstudied as minimal models of many living and synthetic systems from bird flocks\nto active colloids. However, the influence of active rotations in the absence\nof self-propulsion i.e. spinning without walking) remains less explored. Here,\nwe numerically and theoretically investigate the behaviour of ensembles of\nself-spinning dimers. We find that geometric frustration of dimer rotation by\ninteractions yields spatiotemporal order and active melting with no equilibrium\ncounterparts. At low density, the spinning dimers self-assemble into a\ntriangular lattice with their orientations phase-locked into spatially periodic\nphases. The phase-locked patterns form dynamical analogues of the ground states\nof various spin models, transitioning from the 3-state Potts antiferromagnet at\nlow densities to the striped herringbone phase of planar quadrupoles at higher\ndensities. As the density is raised further, the competition between active\nrotations and interactions leads to melting of the active spinner crystal.\nEmergent edge currents, whose direction is set by the chirality of the active\nspinning, arise as a non-equilibrium signature of the transition to the active\nspinner liquid and vanish when the system eventually undergoes kinetic arrest\nat very high densities. Our findings may be realized in systems ranging from\nliquid crystal and colloidal experiments to tabletop realizations using\nmacroscopic chiral grains.\n", "  We discuss the collider bounds on minimal Universal Extra Dimension (mUED)\nmodel from LHC Run-I and II data. The phenomenology of mUED is determined by\nonly two parameters namely, the compactification scale ($R^{-1}$) of the extra\ndimension and cutoff scale ($\\Lambda$) of the theory. The characteristic\nfeature of mUED is the occurrence of nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) particles and hence, soft leptons, soft jets at the collider\nexperiments. The degree of degeneracy of KK-mass spectrum crucially depends on\n$\\Lambda$. The strongest direct bound on $R^{-1}$ ($\\sim $950 GeV for large\n$\\Lambda$) arises from a search for a pair of soft dimuons at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) experiment with 8 TeV center-of-mass energy and $20~{\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. However, for small $\\Lambda$ and hence, small\nsplitting within the first KK-level, the bounds from the dimuon channel is\nrather weak. On the other hand, the discovery of 126 GeV Higgs boson demands\nsmall $\\Lambda$ to prevent the scalar potential form being unbounded from\nbelow. We discuss LHC monojet searches as a probe of low $\\Lambda$ region of\nmUED parameter space. We also compute bounds on the mUED parameter space from\n13 TeV multijets results.\n", "  The hybridization of distinct quantum systems is now seen as an effective way\nto engineer the properties of an entire system leading to applications in\nquantum metamaterials, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. One well\nknown example is superconducting circuits coupled to ensembles of microscopic\nnatural atoms. In such cases, the properties of the individual atom are\nintrinsic, and so are unchangeable. However, current technology allows us to\nfabricate large ensembles of macroscopic artificial atoms such as\nsuperconducting flux qubits, where we can really tailor and control the\nproperties of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate coherent coupling between\na microwave resonator and several thousand superconducting flux qubits, where\nwe observe a large dispersive frequency shift in the spectrum of 250 MHz\ninduced by collective behavior. These results represent the largest number of\ncoupled superconducting qubits realized so far. Our approach shows that it is\nnow possible to engineer the properties of the ensemble, opening up the way for\nthe controlled exploration of the quantum many-body system.\n", "  Glass films prepared by a process of physical vapor deposition have been\nshown to have thermodynamic and kinetic stability comparable to those of\nordinary glasses aged for thousands of years. A central question in the study\nof vapor-deposited glasses, particularly in light of new knowledge regarding\nanisotropy in these materials, is whether the ultra-stable glassy films formed\nby vapor deposition are ever equivalent to those obtained by liquid cooling. We\npresent a computational study of vapor deposition for a two-dimensional glass\nforming liquid using a methodology which closely mimics experiment. We find\nthat for the model considered here, structures that arise in vapor-deposited\nmaterials are statistically identical to those observed in ordinary glasses,\nprovided the two are compared at the same inherent structure energy. We also\nfind that newly deposited hot molecules produce cascades of hot particles that\npropagate far into the film, possibly influencing the relaxation of the\nmaterial.\n", "  FeGa3 is a well known d-p hybridization induced intermetallic bandgap\nsemiconductor. In this work, we present the experimental and theoretical\nresults on the effect of Al substitution in FeGa3, obtained by x-ray\ndiffraction (XRD), temperature dependent resistance measurement, room\ntemperature Mossbauer measurements and density functional theory based\nelectronic structure calculations. It is observed that upto x = 0.178 in\nFe(AlxGa1-x)3, which is the maximum range studied in this work, Al substitution\nreduces the lattice parameters 'a' and 'c' preserving the parent tetragonal\nP42/mnm crystal structure of FeGa3. The bandgap of Fe(AlxGa1-x)3 for x = 0.178\nis reduced by ~ 24% as compared to FeGa3. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data\nshows that the Al atoms replace Ga atoms located at the 8j sites in FeGa3. A\ncomparison of the trends of the lattice parameters and energy bandgap observed\nin the calculations and the experiments also confirms that Al primarily\nreplaces the Ga atoms in the 8j site.\n", "  Visualization and manipulation of nanoscale matter is one of the main and\ncurrent challenges in nanosciences. To this aim, different techniques have been\nrecently developed to non-invasively trap and manipulate nano-specimens, like\nnanoparticles or molecules. However, operating in air or vacuum still remains\nvery challenging since most approaches are limited to a liquid environment. In\nthis letter, we design and characterize a planar Paul trap optimized to trap\nand manipulate individual charged nanoparticles. This configuration offers\ncompetitive capabilities to manipulate nano-specimens in air or vacuum\nincluding in-plane integration, high trap confinement along with dynamical trap\nreconfiguration.\n", "  Searches for new heavy resonances decaying to $WW$, $WZ$, and $ZZ$ bosons are\npresented, using a data sample corresponding to 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider. Analyses selecting $\\nu\\nu qq$, $\\ell\\nu qq$, $\\ell\\ell\nqq$ and $qqqq$ final states are combined, searching for a narrow-width\nresonance with mass between 500 and 3000 GeV. The discriminating variable is\neither an invariant mass or a transverse mass. No significant deviations from\nthe Standard Model predictions are observed. Three benchmark models are tested:\na model predicting the existence of a new heavy scalar singlet, a simplified\nmodel predicting a heavy vector-boson triplet, and a bulk Randall-Sundrum model\nwith a heavy spin-2 graviton. Cross-section limits are set at the 95%\nconfidence level and are compared to theoretical cross-section predictions for\na variety of models. The data exclude a scalar singlet with mass below 2650\nGeV, a heavy vector-boson triplet with mass below 2600 GeV, and a graviton with\nmass below 1100 GeV. These results significantly extend the previous limits set\nusing $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.\n", "  Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) with multi-strip readout are\nconsidered to be the optimal detector candidate for the Time-of-Flight (ToF)\nwall in the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment. In the R&D phase MRPCs\nwith different granularities, low-resistive materials and high voltage stack\nconfigurations were developed and tested. Here, we focus on two prototypes\ncalled HD-P2 and THU-strip, both with strips of 27 cm$^2$ length and\nlow-resistive glass electrodes. The HD-P2 prototype has a single-stack\nconfiguration with 8 gaps while the THU-strip prototype is constructed in a\ndouble-stack configuration with 2 $\\times$ 4 gaps. The performance results of\nthese counters in terms of efficiency and time resolution carried out in a test\nbeam time with heavy-ion beam at GSI in 2014 are presented in this proceeding.\n", "  In this proceeding, we describe the scientific motivation and technical\ndevelopment of the Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph\n(CHESS), focusing on the hardware advancements and testing supporting the\nsecond flight of the payload (CHESS-2). CHESS is a far ultraviolet (FUV)\nrocket-borne instrument designed to study the atomic-to-molecular transitions\nwithin translucent cloud regions in the interstellar medium (ISM). CHESS is an\nobjective f/12.4 echelle spectrograph with resolving power $>$ 100,000 over the\nband pass 1000 $-$ 1600 {\\AA}. The spectrograph was designed to employ an R2\nechelle grating with \"low\" line density. We compare the FUV performance of\nexperimental echelle etching processes (lithographically by LightSmyth, Inc.\nand etching via electron-beam technology by JPL Microdevices Laboratory) with\ntraditional, mechanically-ruled gratings (Bach Research, Inc. and Richardson\nGratings). The cross-dispersing grating, developed and ruled by Horiba\nJobin-Yvon, is a holographically-ruled, \"low\" line density, powered optic with\na toroidal surface curvature. Both gratings were coated with aluminum and\nlithium fluoride (Al+LiF) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Results from\nfinal efficiency and reflectivity measurements for the optical components of\nCHESS-2 are presented. CHESS-2 utilizes a 40mm-diameter cross-strip anode\nreadout microchannel plate (MCP) detector fabricated by Sensor Sciences, Inc.,\nto achieve high spatial resolution with high count rate capabilities (global\nrates $>$ 1 MHz). We present pre-flight laboratory spectra and calibration\nresults. CHESS-2 launched on 21 February 2016 aboard NASA/CU sounding rocket\nmission 36.297 UG. We observed the intervening ISM material along the sightline\nto $\\epsilon$ Per and present initial characterization of the column densities,\ntemperature, and kinematics of atomic and molecular species in the observation.\n", "  Paleomagnetically useful information is expected to be recorded by samples\nwith moments up to three orders of magnitude below the detection limit of\nstandard superconducting rock magnetometers. Such samples are now detectable\nusing recently developed magnetic microscopes, which map the magnetic fields\nabove room-temperature samples with unprecedented spatial resolutions and field\nsensitivities. However, realizing this potential requires the development of\ntechniques for retrieving sample moments from magnetic microscopy data. With\nthis goal, we developed a technique for uniquely obtaining the net magnetic\nmoment of geological samples from magnetic microscopy maps of unresolved or\nnearly unresolved magnetization. This technique is particularly powerful for\nanalyzing small, weakly magnetized samples such as meteoritic chondrules and\nterrestrial silicate crystals like zircons. We validated this technique by\napplying it to field maps generated from synthetic sources and also to field\nmaps measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmicroscope above geological samples with moments down to 10^-15 Am2. For the\nmost magnetic rock samples, the net moments estimated from the SQUID microscope\ndata are within error of independent moment measurements acquired using lower\nsensitivity standard rock magnetometers. In addition to its superior moment\nsensitivity, SQUID microscope net moment magnetometry also enables the\nidentification and isolation of magnetic contamination and background sources,\nwhich is critical for improving accuracy in paleomagnetic studies of weakly\nmagnetic rocks.\n", "  Hexagonally patterned two-dimensional $p$-type semiconductor systems are\nquantum simulators of graphene with strong and highly tunable spin-orbit\ninteractions. We show that application of purely in-plane magnetic fields, in\ncombination with the crystallographic anisotropy present in low-symmetry\nsemiconductor interfaces, allows Chern insulating phases to emerge from an\noriginally topologically insulating state after a quantum phase transition.\nThese phases are characterized by pairs of co-propagating edge modes and Hall\nconductivities $\\sigma_{xy} = +\\frac{2 e^2}{h}, -\\frac{2 e^2}{h}$ in the\nabsence of Landau levels or cyclotron motion. With current lithographic\ntechnology, the Chern insulating transitions are predicted to occur in GaAs\nheterostructures at magnetic fields of $\\sim 5\\text{T}$.\n", "  In the Regge phenomenology, the radial spectrum of light mesons is given by a\nlinear relation $M_n^2=a(n+b)$, where $a$ is a universal slope, the\ndimensionless intercept $b$ depends on quantum numbers, and $n$ enumerates the\nexcited states in radial recurrences. The usual extensions of this relation to\nheavy quarkonia in the framework of hadron string models typically lead to\nstrong nonlinearities which seem to be at variance with the available\nexperimental data. Introducing a radially static string picture of mesons, we\nput forward a linear generalization $(M_n-m_1-m_2)^2=a(n+b)$, where $m_{1,2}$\nare quark masses. The vector channel contains enough experimental states to\ncheck this new relation and a good agreement is observed. It is shown that this\ngeneralization leads to a simple estimate of current quark masses from the\nradial spectra.\n", "  Incommensurate spiral order is a common occurrence in frustrated magnetic\ninsulators. Typically, all magnetic moments rotate uniformly, through the same\nwavevector. However the honeycomb iridates family Li2IrO3 shows an\nincommensurate order where spirals on neighboring sublattices are\ncounter-rotating, giving each moment a different local environment.\nTheoretically describing its spin dynamics has remained a challenge: the Kitaev\ninteractions proposed to stabilize this state, which arise from strong\nspin-orbit effects, induce magnon umklapp scattering processes in spin-wave\ntheory. Here we propose an approach via a (Klein) duality transformation into a\nconventional spiral of a frustrated Heisenberg model, allowing a direct\nderivation of the dynamical structure factor. We analyze both Kitaev and\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya based models, both of which can stabilize counterrotating\nspirals, but with different spin dynamics, and we propose experimental tests to\nidentify the origin of counterrotation.\n", "  In this paper, we use singularity theory to study the entanglement nature of\npure three-qutrit systems. We first consider the algebraic variety $X$ of\nseparable three-qutrit states within the projective Hilbert space\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{H}) = \\mathbb{P}^{26}$. Given a quantum pure state\n$|\\varphi\\rangle\\in \\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{H})$ we define the\n$X_\\varphi$-hypersuface by cutting $X$ with a hyperplane $H_\\varphi$ defined by\nthe linear form $\\langle\\varphi|$ (the $X_\\varphi$-hypersurface of $X$ is\n$X\\cap H_\\varphi \\subset X$).\n  We prove that when $|\\varphi\\rangle$ ranges over the SLOCC entanglement\nclasses, the \"worst\" possible singular $X_\\varphi$-hypersuface with isolated\nsingularities, has a unique singular point of type $D_4$.\n", "  Generation of the cosmological baryon asymmetry in frameworks of spontaneous\nbaryogenesis is studied in detail. It is shown that the relation between\nbaryonic chemical potential and the time derivative of the (pseudo)Goldstone\nfield essentially depends upon the representation chosen for the fermionic\nfields with non-zero baryonic number (quarks). Kinetic equation is modified and\nnumerically solved in equilibrium for the case of time dependent external\nbackground or finite integration time to be applicable to the case when energy\nconservation law is formally violated.\n", "  Multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit an intriguing variety of\nnonlinear structures. In recent theoretical work, the notion of magnetic\nsolitons has been introduced. Here we generalize this concept to vector\ndark-antidark solitary waves in multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates. We\nfirst provide concrete experimental evidence for such states in an atomic BEC\nand subsequently illustrate the broader concept of these states, which are\nbased on the interplay between miscibility and inter-component repulsion. Armed\nwith this more general conceptual framework, we expand the notion of such\nstates to higher dimensions presenting the possibility of both vortex-antidark\nstates and ring-antidark-ring (dark soliton) states. We perform numerical\ncontinuation studies, investigate the existence of these states and examine\ntheir stability using the method of Bogolyubov-de Gennes analysis.\nDark-antidark and vortex-antidark states are found to be stable for broad\nparametric regimes. In the case of ring dark solitons, where the\nsingle-component ring state is known to be unstable, the vector entity appears\nto bear a progressively more and more stabilizing role as the inter-component\ncoupling is increased.\n", "  In this paper we present the null string origin of the ambitwistor string.\nClassically, the null string is the tensionless limit of string theory, and so\ntoo is the Ambitwistor string. Both have as constraint algebra the Galilean\nConformal Algebra in two dimensions. But something interesting happens in the\nquantum theory since there is an ambiguity in quantizing the null string. We\nshow that, given a particular choice of quantization scheme and a particular\ngauge, the null string coincides with the ambitwistor string both classically\nand quantum mechanically. We also show that the same holds for the spinning\nversions of the null string and Ambitwistor string. With these results we\nclarify the relationship between the Ambitwistor string, the null string, the\nusual string and the Hohm-Siegel-Zwiebach theory.\n", "  We introduce and discuss kinetic models describing the influence of the\ncompetence in the evolution of decisions in a multi-agent system. The original\nexchange mechanism, which is based on the human tendency to compromise and\nchange opinion through self-thinking, is here modified to include the role of\nthe agents' competence. In particular, we take into account the agents'\ntendency to behave in the same way as if they were as good, or as bad, as their\npartner: the so-called equality bias. This occurred in a situation where a wide\ngap separated the competence of group members. We discuss the main properties\nof the kinetic models and numerically investigate some examples of collective\ndecision under the influence of the equality bias. The results confirm that the\nequality bias leads the group to suboptimal decisions.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of a double-well Ramsey interferometer using\ninternal state labelling. We consider the use of a thermal ensemble of cold\natoms rather than a Bose-Einstein condensate to minimize the effects of atomic\ninteractions. To maintain a satisfactory level of coherence in this case, a\nhigh degree of symmetry is required between the two arms of the interferometer.\nAssuming that the splitting and recombination processes are adiabatic, we\ntheoretically derive the phase-shift and the contrast of such an interferometer\nin the presence of gravity or an acceleration field. We also consider using a\n\"shortcut to adiabaticity\" protocol to speed up the splitting process and\ndiscuss how such a procedure affects the phase shift and contrast. We find that\nthe two procedures lead to phase-shifts of the same form.\n", "  Spinless, interacting electrons on a finite size triangular lattice moving in\nan extremely strong perpendicular magnetic field are studied and compared with\nthe results on a square lattice. Using a Falicov-Kimball model, the effects of\nthe magnetic field, Coulomb correlation and finite system size on their energy\nspectrum are observed. It is possible to induce a gap in the spectrum by tuning\nthe magnetic field even in the absence of correlation, though extra states\nappear in the gap due to finite size. An orbital current is calculated for both\nthe square and triangular lattice with and without electron correlation. In the\nnoninteracting limit, the bulk current shows several patterns, while the edge\ncurrent shows oscillations with magnetic flux. The oscillations persist in the\ninteracting limit for the square lattice but not for the triangular lattice.\nUsing exact diagonalization techniques, the recursive structure of Hofstadter\nspectrum is examined with strong electronic correlations for different system\nsizes. Electronic correlation is found to suppress these extra states in the\ngap in some cases.\n", "  The observation of the Stark-tuned F\\\"orster resonances between Rydberg atoms\nexcited by narrowband cw laser radiation requires usage of a Stark-switching\ntechnique in order to excite the atoms first in a fixed electric field and then\nto induce the interactions in a varied electric field, which is scanned across\nthe F\\\"orster resonance. In our experiments with a few cold Rb Rydberg atoms we\nhave found that the transients at the edges of the electric pulses strongly\naffect the line shapes of the F\\\"orster resonances, since the population\ntransfer at the resonances occurs on a time scale of $\\sim$100 ns, which is\ncomparable with the duration of the transients. For example, a short-term\nringing at a certain frequency causes additional radio-frequency-assisted\nF\\\"orster resonances, while non-sharp edges lead to asymmetry. The intentional\napplication of the radio-frequency field induces transitions between collective\nstates, whose line shape depends on the interaction strengths and time. Spatial\naveraging over the atom positions in a single interaction volume yields a\ncusped line shape of the F\\\"orster resonance. We present a detailed\nexperimental and theoretical analysis of the line shape and time dynamics of\nthe Stark-tuned F\\\"orster resonances ${\\rm Rb}(nP_{3/2} )+{\\rm Rb}(nP_{3/2}\n)\\to {\\rm Rb}(nS_{1/2} )+{\\rm Rb}([n+1]S_{1/2} )$ for two Rb Rydberg atoms\ninteracting in a time-varying electric field.\n", "  We develop a microscopic picture of shear thickening in dense suspensions\nwhich emphasizes the role of frictional forces, coupling rotational and\ntranslational degrees of freedom. Simulations with contact forces and viscous\ndrag only, reveal pronounced shear thickening with a simultaneous increase in\ncontact number and energy dissipation by frictional forces. At high densities,\nwhen the translational motion is severely constrained, we observe liquid-like\ngear-states with pronounced relative rotations of the particles coexisting with\nsolid-like regions which rotate as a whole. The latter are stabilised by\nfrustrated loops which become more numerous and persistent with increasing\npressure, giving rise to an increasing lengthscale of this mosaique-like\nstructure and a corresponding increase in viscosity.\n", "  Thermoelectric properties of graphene nanoribbons with periodic edge\nvacancies and antidot lattice are investigated. The electron-phonon interaction\nis taken into account in the framework of the Hubbard-Holstein model with the\nuse of the Lang-Firsov unitary transformation scheme. The electron transmission\nfunction, the thermopower and the thermoelectric figure of merit are\ncalculated. We have found that the electron-phonon interaction causes a\ndecrease in the peak values of the thermoelectric figure of merit and the shift\nof the peak positions closer to the center of the bandgap. The effects are more\npronounced for the secondary peaks that appear in the structures with periodic\nantidot.\n", "  We use the no-wall holographic approach (a relative of the soft-wall one) to\nconstruct a universal description of vector mesons with arbitrary quark masses.\nThe proposed model predicts a specific dependence of the parameters of radial\nRegge trajectories on the quark masses in a reasonable agreement with the meson\nphenomenology and some theoretical expectations.\n", "  We derive an explicit form for the electronic friction as felt by a molecule\nnear a metal surface for the general case that molecule-metal couplings depend\non nuclear coordinates. Our work generalizes a previous study by von Oppen et\nal [Beilstein Journal of Nanotechnology, 3, 144, 2012], where we now go beyond\nthe Condon approximation (i.e. molecule-metal couplings are not held constant).\nUsing a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in the adiabatic limit, we\nshow that fluctuating metal-molecule couplings lead to new frictional damping\nterms and random forces, plus a correction to the potential of mean force.\nNumerical tests are performed and compared with a modified classical master\nequation; our results indicate that violating the Condon approximation can have\na large effect on dynamics.\n", "  We report a time-dependent density functional based tight-binding (TD-DFTB)\nscheme for the calculation of UV/Vis spectra, explicitly taking into account\nthe excitation of nuclear vibrations via the adiabatic Hessian Franck-Condon\n(AH|FC) method with a harmonic approximation for the nuclear wavefunction. The\ntheory of vibrationally resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy is first summarized from\nthe viewpoint of TD-DFTB. The method is benchmarked against time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations for strongly dipole allowed\nexcitations in various aromatic and polar molecules. Using the recent 3ob:freq\nparameter set of Elstner's group, very good agreement with TD-DFT calculations\nusing local functionals was achieved.\n", "  In this work, the perturbative QCD series of the scalar correlation function\n$\\Psi(s)$ is investigated. Besides ${\\rm Im}\\Psi(s)$, which is relevant for\nHiggs decay into quarks, two other physical correlators, $\\Psi^{\"}(s)$ and\n$D^L(s)$, have been employed in QCD applications like quark mass determinations\nor hadronic $\\tau$ decays. $D^L(s)$ suffers from large higher-order corrections\nand, by resorting to the large-$\\beta_0$ approximation, it is shown that this\nis related to a spurious renormalon ambiguity at $u=1$. Hence, this correlator\nshould be avoided in phenomenological analyses. Moreover, it turns out\nadvantageous to express the quark mass factor, introduced to make the scalar\ncurrent renormalisation group invariant, in terms of the renormalisation\ninvariant quark mass $\\hat m_q$. To further study the behaviour of the\nperturbative expansion, we introduce a QCD coupling $\\hat\\alpha_s$, whose\nrunning is explicitly renormalisation scheme independent. The scheme dependence\nof $\\hat\\alpha_s$ is parametrised by a single parameter $C$, being related to\ntransformations of the QCD scale parameter $\\Lambda$. It is demonstrated that\nappropriate choices of $C$ lead to a substantial improvement in the behaviour\nof the perturbative series for $\\Psi^{\"}(s)$ and ${\\rm Im}\\Psi(s)$.\n", "  We propose a novel description for the Higgs mechanism by which a gauge boson\nacquires the mass. We do not assume spontaneous breakdown of gauge symmetry\nsignaled by a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. In\nfact, we give a manifestly gauge-invariant description of the Higgs mechanism\nin the operator level, which does not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nThis enables us to discuss the confinement-Higgs complementarity from a new\nperspective. The \"Abelian\" dominance in quark confinement of the Yang-Mills\ntheory is understood as a consequence of the gauge-invariant Higgs phenomenon\nfor the relevant Yang-Mills-Higgs model.\n", "  We report direct experimental evidence of interspecies ion separation in\ndirect-drive, inertial-confinement-fusion experiments on the OMEGA laser\nfacility. These experiments, which used plastic capsules with D$_2$/Ar gas fill\n(1% Ar by atom), were designed specifically to reveal interspecies ion\nseparation by exploiting the predicted, strong ion thermo-diffusion between ion\nspecies of large mass and charge difference. Via detailed analyses of imaging\nx-ray-spectroscopy data, we extract Ar-atom-fraction radial profiles at\ndifferent times, and observe both enhancement and depletion compared to the\ninitial 1%-Ar gas fill. The experimental results are interpreted with\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations that include recently implemented,\nfirst-principles models of interspecies ion diffusion. The experimentally\ninferred Ar-atom-fraction profiles agree reasonably, but not exactly, with\ncalculated profiles associated with the incoming and rebounding first shock.\n", "  We show that a particle detector can distinguish the interior of a hollow\nshell from flat space for switching times much shorter than the light-crossing\ntime of the shell, even though the local metrics are indistinguishable. This\nshows that a particle detector can read out information about the non-local\nstructure of spacetime even when switched on for scales much shorter than the\ncharacteristic scale of the non-locality.\n", "  Fermion masses can be generated through four-fermion condensates when\nsymmetries prevent fermion bilinear condensates from forming. This less\nexplored mechanism of fermion mass generation is responsible for making four\nreduced staggered lattice fermions massive at strong couplings in a lattice\nmodel with a local four-fermion coupling. The model has a massless fermion\nphase at weak couplings and a massive fermion phase at strong couplings. In\nparticular there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking of any lattice symmetries\nin both these phases. Recently it was discovered that in three space-time\ndimensions there is a direct second order phase transition between the two\nphases. Here we study the same model in four space-time dimensions and find\nresults consistent with the existence of a narrow intermediate phase with\nfermion bilinear condensates, that separates the two asymptotic phases by\ncontinuous phase transitions.\n", "  With the aid of the $6j$-symbol, we classify all uniserial modules of\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2)\\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}_{n}$, where $\\mathfrak{h}_{n}$ is the\nHeisenberg Lie algebra of dimension $2n+1$.\n", "  We present two novel designs for a telescope suitable for\nmassively-multiplexed spectroscopy. The first is a very wide field Cassegrain\ntelescope optimised for fibre feeding. It provides a Field Of View (FOV) of 2.5\ndegrees diameter with a 10m primary mirror. It is telecentric and works at F/3,\noptimal for fibre injection. As an option, a gravity invariant focus for the\ncentral 10 arc-minutes can be added, to host, for instance, a giant integral\nfield unit (IFU). It has acceptable performance in the 360-1300 nm wavelength\nrange. The second concept is an innovative five mirror telescope design based\non a Three Mirror Anastigmatic (TMA) concept. The design provides a large FOV\nin a convenient, gravity- invariant focal plane, and is scalable to a range of\ntelescope diameters. As specific example, we present a 10m telescope with a 1.5\ndegree diameter FOV and a relay system that allows simultaneous spectroscopy\nwith 10,000 mini-IFUs over a square degree, or, alternatively a 17.5 square\narcminutes giant IFU, by using 240 MUSE-type spectrographs. We stress the\nimportance of developing the telescope and instrument designs for both cases.\n", "  Long-ranged correlations generically exist in non-equilibrium fluid systems.\nIn the case of a non-equilibrium steady state caused by a temperature gradient\nthe correlations are especially long-ranged and strong. The anomalous light\nscattering predicted to exist in these systems is well-confirmed by numerous\nexperiments. Recently the Casimir force or pressure due to these fluctuations\nor correlations have been discussed in great detail. In this paper the notion\nof a Casimir work is introduced and a novel way to measure the non-equilibrium\nCasimir force is suggested. In particular, the non-equilibrium Casimir force is\nrelated to a non-equilibrium heat and not, as in equilibrium, to a volume\nderivative of an average energy. The non-equilibrium work fluctuations are\ndetermined and shown to be very anomalous compared to equilibrium work\nfluctuations. The non-equilibrium work distribution is also computed, and\ncontrasted to work distributions in systems with short-range correlations.\nAgain, there is a striking difference in the two cases. Formal theories of work\nand work distributions in non-equilibrium steady states are not explicit enough\nto illustrate any of these interesting features.\n", "  We propose a speculative scenario where dynamo amplification of magnetic\nfields in the core convective shells of massive stars, tens of years to hours\nbefore they explode, leads to envelope expansion and enhanced mass loss rate,\nresulting in pre-explosion outbursts (PEOs). The convective luminosity in the\nburning shells of carbon, neon, oxygen, and then silicon, are very high. Based\non the behavior of active main sequence stars we speculate that the convective\nshells can trigger magnetic activity with a power of about 0.001 times the\nconvective luminosity. Magnetic flux tubes might buoy outward, and deposit\ntheir energy in the outer parts of the envelope. This in turn might lead to the\nexpansion of the envelope and to an enhanced mass loss rate. If a close binary\ncompanion is present, mass transfer might take place and lead to an energetic\noutburst. The magnetic activity requires minimum core rotation and that the\nstochastic magnetic activity be on its high phase. Only in rare cases these\nconditions are met, accounting for that only the minority of core collapse\nsupernovae (CCSNe) experience PEO. Such a pre-explosion magnetic activity might\nhave implications for the explosion mechanism itself.\n", "  A search for double beta decays of $^{110}$Pd and $^{102}$Pd into excited\nstates of the daughter nuclides has been performed using three ultra-low\nbackground gamma-spectrometry measurements in the Felsenkeller laboratory,\nGermany, the HADES laboratory, Belgium and at the LNGS, Italy. The combined\nBayesian analysis of the three measurements sets improved half-life limits for\nthe $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay modes of the $2^+_1$, $0^+_1$\nand $2^+_2$ transitions in $^{110}$Pd to $2.9\\cdot10^{20}$ yr,\n$4.0\\cdot10^{20}$ yr and $3.0\\cdot10^{20}$ yr respectively and in $^{102}$Pd to\n$7.6\\cdot10^{18}$ yr, $8.8\\cdot10^{18}$ yr and $1.4\\cdot10^{19}$ yr\nrespectively with 90% credibility.\n", "  A simple regular black hole solution satisfying the weak energy condition is\nobtained within Einstein--non--linear electrodynamics theory. We have computed\nthe thermodynamic properties of this black hole by a careful analysis of the\nhorizons and we have found that the usual Bekenstein--Hawking entropy gets\ncorrected by a logarithmic term. Therefore, in this sense our model realizes\nsome quantum gravity predictions which add this kind of correction to the black\nhole entropy. In particular, we have established some similitudes between our\nmodel and a quadratic generalized uncertainty principle. This similitude has\nbeen confirmed by the existence of a remnant, which prevents complete\nevaporation, in agreement with the quadratic generalized uncertainty principle\ncase.\n", "  In this paper we compute the relation between heavy quark masses defined in\nthe modified minimal subtraction and on-shell scheme. Detailed results are\npresented for all coefficients of the SU$(N_c)$ colour factors. The reduction\nof the four-loop on-shell integrals is performed for a general QCD gauge\nparameter. Some of the about 380 master integrals are computed analytically,\nothers with high numerical precision based on Mellin-Barnes representations,\nand the rest numerically with the help of {\\tt FIESTA}. We discuss in detail\nthe precise numerical evaluation of the four-loop master integrals. Updated\nrelations between various short-distance masses and the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$\nquark mass to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy are provided for\nthe charm, bottom and top quark. We discuss the dependence on the\nrenormalization and factorization scale.\n", "  A model of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring optical lattice with atomic\ndissipations applied at a stationary or at a moving location on the ring is\npresented. The localized dissipation is shown to generate and stabilize both\nstationary and traveling lattice solitons. Among many localized solutions, we\nhave generated spatially stationary quasiperiodic lattice soltions and a family\nof traveling lattice solitons with two intensity peaks per potential well with\nno counterpart in the discrete case. Collisions between traveling and\nstationary lattice solitons as well as between two traveling lattice solitons\ndisplay a critical dependence from the lattice depth. Stable counterpropagating\nsolitons in ring lattices can find applications in gyroscope interferometers\nwith ultra-cold gases.\n", "  An explicit high-order noncanonical symplectic algorithm for ideal two-fluid\nsystems is developed. The fluid is discretized as particles in the Lagrangian\ndescription, while the electromagnetic fields and internal energy are treated\nas discrete differential form fields on a fixed mesh. With the assistance of\nWhitney interpolating forms, this scheme preserves the gauge symmetry of the\nelectromagnetic field, and the pressure field is naturally derived from the\ndiscrete internal energy. The whole system is solved using the Hamiltonian\nsplitting method discovered by He et al., which was been successfully adopted\nin constructing symplectic particle-in-cell schemes. Because of its structure\npreserving and explicit nature, this algorithm is especially suitable for\nlarge-scale simulations for physics problems that are multi-scale and require\nlong-term fidelity and accuracy. The algorithm is verified via two tests:\nstudies of the dispersion relation of waves in a two-fluid plasma system and\nthe oscillating two-stream instability.\n", "  We discuss an extension of the instanton-dyon liquid model that includes\nlight quarks at finite chemical potential in the center symmetric phase. We\ndevelop the model in details for the case of SU_c(2)\\times SU_f(2) by mapping\nthe theory on a 3-dimensional quantum effective theory. We analyze the\ndifferent phases in the mean-field approximation. We extend this analysis to\nthe general case of SU_c(N_c)\\times SU_f(N_f) and note that the chiral and\ndiquark pairings are always comparable.\n", "  We extend recent results on domain wall description of superconductivity in\nan Abelian Higgs model by introducing a particular Lorentz-violating term. The\ntemperature of the system is interpreted through the fact that the soliton\nfollowing accelerating orbits is a Rindler observer experiencing a thermal\nbath. We show that this term can be associated with the {\\sl Kondo effect},\nthat is, the Lorentz-violating parameter is closely related to the\nconcentration of magnetic impurities living on a superconducting domain wall.\nWe also found that the critical temperature decreasing with the impurity\nconcentration as a non single-valued function, for the case $T_K < T_{c0}$,\ndevelops a negative curvature and presents deviations from the Abrikosov and\nGor'kov theory, a phenomenon already supported by experimental evidence.\n", "  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions are arguably the most\ncompelling dark matter candidates in the literature. Could they coexist as dark\nmatter particles? More importantly, can they be incorporated in a well\nmotivated framework in agreement with experimental data? In this work, we show\nthat this two component dark matter can be realized in the Inert Doublet Model\nin an elegant and natural manner by virtue of the spontaneous breaking of a\nPeccei-Quinn $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry into a residual $Z_2$ symmetry. The WIMP\nstability is guaranteed by the $Z_{2}$ symmetry and a new dark matter\ncomponent, the axion, arises. There are two interesting outcomes: (i)\nvector-like quarks needed to implement the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the model\nact as a portal between the dark sector and the SM fields with a\nsupersymmetry-type phenomenology at colliders; (ii) two-component Inert Doublet\nModel re-opens the phenomenologically interesting 100-500 GeV mass region. We\nshow that the model can plausibly have two component dark matter and at the\nsame time avoid low and high energy physics constraints such as monojet and\ndijet plus missing energy, as well as indirect and direct dark matter detection\nbounds.\n", "  Professional development workshops are one of the primary mechanisms used to\nhelp faculty improve their teaching, and draw in many STEM instructors every\nyear. Although workshops serve a critical role in changing instructional\npractices within our community, we rarely assess workshops through careful\nconsideration of how they engage faculty. Initial evidence suggests that\nworkshop leaders often overlook central tenets of education research that are\nwell-established in classroom contexts, such as the role of interactivity in\nenabling student learning. As such, there is a need to develop more robust,\nevidence-based models of how best to support faculty learning in professional\ndevelopment contexts, and to activity support workshop leaders in relating\ntheir design decisions to familiar ideas form other educational contexts. In\nresponse to these needs, we have developed an observation tool, the Real-Time\nProfessional Development Observation Tool (R-PDOT), to document the form and\nfocus of faculty's engagement during workshops. In this paper, we describe the\nmotivation and methodological considerations behind the development of the\nR-PDOT, justify our decisions to highlight particular aspects of workshop\nsessions, and demonstrate how the R-PDOT can be used to analyze three sessions\nfrom the Physics and Astronomy New Faculty Workshop. We also justify the\naccessibility and potential utility of the R-PDOT output as a reflective tool\nusing preliminary data from interviews with workshop leaders, and consider the\nroles the R-PDOT could play in supporting future research on faculty\nprofessional development.\n", "  We study supersymmetry enhancement from ${\\cal N}=3$ to ${\\cal N}=4$ proposed\nby Aharony and Tachikawa by using string junctions in S-folds. The central\ncharges carried by junctions play a central role in our analysis. We consider\nplaner junctions in a specific plane. Before the S-folding they carry two\ncomplex central charges, which we denote by $Z$ and $\\bar Z$. The S-fold\nprojection eliminates $\\bar Z$ as well as one of the four supercharges, and\nwhen the supersymmetry is enhanced $\\bar Z$ should be reproduced by some\nnon-perturbative mechanism. For the models of $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_4$\nS-folds which are expected to give $SU(3)$ and $SO(5)$ ${\\cal N}=4$ theories we\ncompare the junction spectra with those in perturbative brane realization of\nthe same theories. We establish one-to-one correspondence so that $Z$\ncoincides. By using the correspondence we also give an expression for the\nenhanced central charge $\\bar Z$.\n", "  Photonic crystal fibers doped with silver nanoparticles exhibit the Kerr\nnonlinearity that can be positive or negative depending on wavelength and\nvanishes at a specific wavelength. We study numerically how the simultaneous\npresence of a zero-nonlinearity wavelength (ZNW) and a zero-dispersion\nwavelength affects evolution of soliton and supercontinuum generation inside\nsuch fibers and find a number of unique features. The existence of negative\nnonlinearity allows soliton formation even in the normaldispersion region of\nthe fiber, and the ZNW acts as a barrier for the Raman-induced red shift of\nsolitons.\n", "  We numerically investigate the distribution of Drude weights $D$ of many-body\nstates in disordered one-dimensional interacting electron systems across the\ntransition to a many-body localized phase. Drude weights are proportional to\nthe spectral curvatures induced by magnetic fluxes in mesoscopic rings. They\noffer a method to relate the transition to the many-body localized phase to\ntransport properties. In the delocalized regime, we find that the Drude weight\ndistribution at a fixed disorder configuration agrees well with the\nrandom-matrix-theory prediction $P(D) \\propto (\\gamma^2+D^2)^{-3/2}$, although\nthe distribution width $\\gamma$ strongly fluctuates between disorder\nrealizations. A crossover is observed towards a distribution with different\nlarge-$D$ asymptotics deep in the many-body localized phase, which however\ndiffers from the commonly expected Cauchy distribution. We show that the\naverage distribution width $\\langle \\gamma\\rangle $, rescaled by $L\\Delta$,\n$\\Delta$ being the average level spacing in the middle of the spectrum and $L$\nthe systems size, is an efficient probe of the many-body localization\ntransition, as it increases/vanishes exponentially in the delocalized/localized\nphase.\n", "  Optical designs are presented for the Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE)\ntelescope. The adopted baseline design is a prime focus telescope with a\nsegmented primary of 11.25m aperture, with speed f/1.93 and 1.52deg\nfield-of-view, optimized for wavelengths 360-1800nm. The Wide-Field Corrector\n(WFC) has five aspheric lenses, mostly of fused silica, with largest element\n1.33m diameter and total glass mass 788kg. The Atmospheric Dispersion Corrector\n(ADC) is of the compensating lateral type, combining a motion of the entire WFC\nvia the hexapod, with a restoring motion for a single lens. There is a modest\namount of vignetting (average 5% over the hexagonal field); this greatly\nimproves image quality, and allows the design to be effectively pupil-centric.\nThe polychromatic image quality is d80<0.225\"/0.445\" at ZD 0/60deg over more\nthan 95% of the hexagonal field-of-view. The ADC action allows adjustment of\nthe plate-scale with zenith distance, which is used to halve the image motions\ncaused by differential refraction. A simple design is presented for achieving\nthe required ADC lens shifts and tilts. A two-mirror design was also undertaken\nfor MSE, but was not selected. This is a 12.3m F/2.69 forward Cassegrain\ndesign, with a 2.75m diameter M2, and three silica lenses, of largest diameter\n1.33m. The field-of-view is again 1.52deg. The f/0.95 primary makes the design\nremarkably compact, being under 10m long. The ADC action involves a small\nmotion of M2 (again via a hexapod), and shifts and tilts of a single lens. The\ndesign is effectively pupil-centric, with modest vignetting (5.9% average). The\nimage quality is virtually identical to the prime focus design.\n", "  We propose a simple method for the computation of the flat coordinates and\nSaito primitive forms on Frobenius manifolds of the deformations of Jacobi\nrings associated with isolated singularities. The method is based on using a\nconjecture about integral representations for the flat coordinates and on the\nSaito cohomology theory. This reduces the computation to a simple linear\nproblem. We consider the case of the deformed Gepner chiral rings. The\nknowledge of the flat structures of Frobenius manifolds can be used for exact\nsolution of the models of the topological conformal field theories\ncorresponding to these chiral rings.\n", "  The Polymer Quantization of the Fourier modes of the real scalar field is\nstudied within algebraic scheme. We replace the positive linear functional of\nthe standard Poincar\\'e invariant quantization by a singular one. This singular\npositive linear functional is constructed as mimicking the singular limit of\nthe complex structure of the Poincar\\'e invariant Fock quantization. The\nresulting symmetry group of such Polymer Quantization is the subgroup\n$\\mbox{SDiff}(\\mathbb{R}^4)$ which is a subgroup of $\\mbox{Diff}(\\mathbb{R}^4)$\nformed by spatial volume preserving diffeomorphisms. In consequence, this\nyields an entirely different irreducible representation of the Canonical\nCommutation Relations, non-unitary equivalent to the standard Fock\nrepresentation. We also compared the Poincar\\'e invariant Fock vacuum with the\nPolymer Fourier vacuum.\n", "  This paper summarizes the results from measurements aiming to characterize\nultracold neutron detection with 6Li-doped glass scintillators. Single GS10 or\nGS20 scintillators, with a thickness of 100-200 micrometer, fulfill the\nultracold neutron detection requirements with an acceptable neutron-gamma\ndiscrimination. This discrimination is clearly improved with a stack of two\nscintillators: a 6Li-depleted glass bonded to a 6Li-enriched glass. The optical\ncontact bonding is used between the scintillators in order to obtain a perfect\noptical contact. The scintillator's detection efficiency is similar to that of\na 3He Strelkov gas detector. Coupled to a digital data acquisition system,\ncounting rates up to a few 10^5 counts/s can be handled. A detector based on\nsuch a scintillator stack arrangement was built and has been used in the\nneutron electric dipole moment experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute since\n2010. Its response for the regular runs of the neutron electric dipole moment\nexperiment is presented.\n", "  The Rapid Transient Surveyor (RTS) is a proposed rapid-response, high-cadence\nadaptive optics (AO) facility for the UH 2.2-m telescope on Maunakea. RTS will\nuniquely address the need for high-acuity and sensitive near-infrared spectral\nfollow-up observations of tens of thousands of objects in mere months by\ncombining an excellent observing site, unmatched robotic observational\nefficiency, and an AO system that significantly increases both sensitivity and\nspatial resolving power. We will initially use RTS to obtain the infrared\nspectra of ~4,000 Type Ia supernovae identified by the Asteroid\nTerrestrial-Impact Last Alert System over a two year period that will be\ncrucial to precisely measuring distances and mapping the distribution of dark\nmatter in the z < 0.1 universe. RTS will comprise an upgraded version of the\nRobo-AO laser AO system and will respond quickly to target-of-opportunity\nevents, minimizing the time between discovery and characterization. RTS will\nacquire simultaneous-multicolor images with an acuity of 0.07-0.10\" across the\nentire visible spectrum (20% i'-band Strehl in median conditions) and <0.16\" in\nthe near infrared, and will detect companions at 0.5\" at contrast ratio of\n~500. The system will include a high-efficiency prism integral field unit\nspectrograph: R = 70-140 over a total bandpass of 840-1830 nm with an 8.7\" by\n6.0\" field of view (0.15\" spaxels). The AO correction boosts the infrared\npoint-source sensitivity of the spectrograph against the sky background by a\nfactor of seven for faint targets, giving the UH 2.2-m the H-band sensitivity\nof a 5.7-m telescope without AO.\n", "  We use the numerical conformal bootstrap in two dimensions to search for\nfinite, closed sub-algebras of the operator product expansion (OPE), without\nassuming unitarity. We find the minimal models as special cases, as well as\nadditional lines of solutions that can be understood in the Coulomb gas\nformalism. All the solutions we find that contain the vacuum in the operator\nalgebra are cases where the external operators of the bootstrap equation are\ndegenerate operators, and we argue that this follows analytically from the\nexpressions in arXiv:1202.4698 for the crossing matrices of Virasoro conformal\nblocks. Our numerical analysis is a special case of the \"Gliozzi\" bootstrap\nmethod, and provides a simpler setting in which to study technical challenges\nwith the method.\n  In the supplementary material, we provide a Mathematica notebook that\nautomates the calculation of the crossing matrices and OPE coefficients for\ndegenerate operators using the formulae of Dotsenko and Fateev.\n", "  A variety of experimental techniques for the generation of\nsubsonic/supersonic dust fluid flows and means of measuring such flow\nvelocities are presented. The experiments have been carried out in a\n$\\Pi-$shaped Dusty Plasma Experimental (DPEx) device with micron size\nkaolin/Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) particles embedded in a background of Argon\nplasma created by a direct current (DC) glow discharge. A stationary dust cloud\nis formed over the cathode region by precisely balancing the pumping speed and\ngas flow rate. A flow of dust particles/fluid is generated by additional gas\ninjection from a single or dual locations or by altering the dust confining\npotential. The flow velocity is then estimated by three different techniques,\nnamely, by super Particle Identification (sPIT) code, Particle Image\nVelocimetry (PIV) analysis and the excitation of Dust Acoustic Waves (DAWs).\nThe results obtained from these three different techniques along with their\nmerits and demerits are discussed. An estimation of the neutral drag force\nresponsible for the generation as well as the attenuation of the dust fluid\nflow is made. These techniques can be usefully employed in laboratory devices\nto investigate linear and non-linear collective excitations in a flowing dusty\nplasma.\n", "  We investigate the property of the high-density nuclear matter probed by the\nnucleus-nucleus elastic scattering in the framework of the double-folding (DF)\nmodel with the complex $G$-matrix interaction. The medium effect including\nthree-body-force (TBF) effect is investigated with present two methods based on\nthe frozen density approximation (FDA). The medium effect is clearly seen on\nthe potential and the elastic cross section for the $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O system\nat $E/A =$ 70 MeV. The crucial role of the medium effect is also confirmed with\nother effective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interactions. In addition, the present\nmethods are applied to other heavy-ion elastic scattering systems. Again, the\nmedium effect is clearly seen in the heavy-ion elastic cross section. The\nmedium effect on the elastic cross section becomes invisible with the increase\nof the target mass and the incident energy (up to $E/A =$ 200 MeV). However,\nthe medium effect is again important to fix the heavy-ion scattering over $E/A\n=$ 200 MeV. Finally, we make clear the crucial role of the TBF effect up to\n$k_F =$ 1.6 fm$^{-1}$ in the nucleus-nucleus elastic scattering.\n", "  Based upon the color-dipole picture, we provide closed analytic expressions\nfor the longitudinal and the transverse photoabsorption cross sections at low\nvalues of the Bjorken variable of x<0.1. We compare with the experimental data\nfor the longitudinal-to-transverse ratio of the (virtual) photoabsorption cross\nsection and with our previous fit to the experimental data for the total\nphotoabsorption cross section. Scaling in terms of the low-x scaling variable\neta(W^2,Q^2) is analyzed in terms of the reduced cross section of deep\ninelastic scattering.\n", "  Pulsed domain wall movement is studied here in Ni80Fe20 nanowires on SiO2,\nusing a fully integrated electrostatic, thermoelectric, and micromagnetics\nsolver based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation, including Joule heating,\nanisotropic magneto-resistance, and Oersted field contributions. During the\napplied pulse the anisotropic magneto-resistance of the domain wall generates a\ndynamic heat gradient which increases the current-driven velocity by up to 15%.\nUsing a temperature-dependent conductivity significant differences are found\nbetween the constant voltage-pulsed and constant current-pulsed domain wall\nmovement: constant voltage pulses are shown to be more efficient at displacing\ndomain walls whilst minimizing the increase in temperature, with the total\ndomain wall displacement achieved over a fixed pulse duration having a maximum\nwith respect to the driving pulse strength.\n", "  We describe a new theoretical and numerical framework of the\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulation incorporated with an anisotropic pressure\ntensor, which can play an important role in a collisionless plasma. A classical\napproach to handle the anisotropy is based on the double adiabatic\napproximation assuming that a pressure tensor is well described only by the\ncomponents parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field. This\ngyrotropic assumption, however, fails around a magnetically neutral region,\nwhere the cyclotron period may get comparable to or even longer than a\ndynamical time in a system, and causes a singularity in the mathematical\nexpression. In this paper, we demonstrate that this singularity can be\ncompletely removed away by the combination of direct use of the 2nd-moment of\nthe Vlasov equation and an ingenious gyrotropization model. Numerical tests\nalso verify that the present model properly reduces to the standard MHD or the\ndouble adiabatic formulation in an asymptotic manner under an appropriate\nlimit.\n", "  The dynamical responses of Blume-Capel (S=1) ferromagnet to the plane\npropagating (with fixed frequency and wavelength) and standing magnetic field\nwaves are studied sepa- rately in two dimensions by extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulation. Depending on the values of temperature, amplitude of the\npropagating magnetic field and the strength of anisotropy, two different\ndynamical phases are observed. For a fixed value of anisotropy and the\namplitude of the propagating magnetic field, the system undergoes a dynamical\nphase transition from a driven spin wave propagating phase to a pinned or spin\nfrozen state as the system is cooled down. The time averaged magnetisation over\na full cycle of the propagating magnetic field plays the role of the dynamic\norder parameter. A comprehensive phase diagram is plotted in the plane formed\nby the amplitude of the propagating wave and the temperature of the system. It\nis found that the phase boundary shrinks inward as the anisotropy increases.\nThe phase boundary, in the plane described by the strength of the anisotropy\nand temperature, is also drawn. This phase boundary was observed to shrink\ninward as the field amplitude increases.\n", "  The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ultrathin ferromagnets can result in\nnonreciprocal propagation of spin waves. We examine theoretically how spin wave\npower flow is influenced by this interaction. We show that the combination of\nthe dipole-dipole and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions can result in\nunidirectional caustic beams in the Damon-Eshbach geometry. Morever,\nself-generated interface patterns can also be induced from a point-source\nexcitation.\n", "  The electron dynamics in dielectric materials induced by intense femtosecond\nlaser pulses is theoretically addressed. The laser driven temporal evolution of\nthe energy distribution of electrons in the conduction band is described by a\nkinetic Boltzmann equation. In addition to the collisional processes for energy\ntransfer such as electron-phonon-photon and electron-electron interactions, a\nnon-collisional process for photon absorption in the conduction band is\nincluded. It relies on direct transitions between sub-bands of the conduction\nband through multiphoton absorption. This mechanism is shown to significantly\ncontribute to the laser heating of conduction electrons for large enough laser\nintensities. It also increases the time required for the electron distribution\nto reach the equilibrium state as described by the Fermi-Dirac statistics.\nQuantitative results are provided for quartz irradiated by a femtosecond laser\npulse with a wavelength of 800 nm and for intensities in the range of tens of\nTW/cm$^2$, lower than the ablation threshold. The change in the energy\ndeposition induced by this non-collisional heating process is expected to have\na significant influence on the laser processing of dielectric materials.\n", "  We study exciton radiative decay in a two-dimensional material, taking into\naccount large thermal population in the non-radiative states, from which\nexcitons are scattered into the radiative states by acoustic phonons. We find\nan analytical solution of the kinetic equation for the non-equilibrium\ndistribution function of excitons in the radiative states. Our estimates for\nbright excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides indicate a strong depletion\nof radiative state population due to insufficient exciton-phonon scattering\nrate at low temperatures.\n", "  We present the clustering properties of a complete sample of 968 radio\nsources detected at 1.4 GHz by the VLA-COSMOS survey with radio fluxes brighter\nthan 0.15 mJy. 92% have redshift determinations from the Laigle et al. (2016)\ncatalogue. Based on their radio-luminosity, these objects have been divided\ninto two populations of 644 AGN and 247 star-forming galaxies. By fixing the\nslope of the auto-correlation function to gamma=2, we find\nr_0=11.7^{+1.0}_{-1.1} Mpc for the clustering length of the whole sample, while\nr_0=11.2^{+2.5}_{-3.3} Mpc and r_0=7.8^{+1.6}_{-2.1} Mpc (r_0=6.8^{+1.4}_{-1.8}\nMpc if we restrict our analysis to z<0.9) are respectively obtained for AGN and\nstar-forming galaxies. These values correspond to minimum masses for dark\nmatter haloes of M_min=10^[13.6^{+0.3}_{-0.6}] M_sun for radio-selected AGN and\nM_min=10^[13.1^{+0.4}_{-1.6}] M_sun for radio-emitting star-forming galaxies\n(M_min=10^[12.7^{+0.7}_{-2.2}] M_sun for z<0.9). Comparisons with previous\nworks imply an independence of the clustering properties of the AGN population\nwith respect to both radio luminosity and redshift. We also investigate the\nrelationship between dark and luminous matter in both populations. We obtain\n<M*>/M_halo<~10^{-2.7} for AGN, and <M*>/M_halo<~10^{-2.4} in the case of\nstar-forming galaxies. Furthermore, if we restrict to z<~0.9 star-forming\ngalaxies, we derive <M*>/M_halo<~10^{-2.1}, result which clearly indicates the\ncosmic process of stellar build-up as one moves towards the more local\nuniverse. Comparisons between the observed space density of radio-selected AGN\nand that of dark matter haloes shows that about one in two haloes is associated\nwith a black hole in its radio-active phase. This suggests that the\nradio-active phase is a recurrent phenomenon.\n", "  We study weakly coupled $U(1)$ theories in $AdS_3$, their associated charged\nBTZ solutions, and their charged spectra. We find that modular invariance of\nthe holographic dual two-dimensional CFT and compactness of the gauge group\ntogether imply the existence of charged operators with conformal dimension\nsignificantly below the black hole threshold. We regard this as a form of the\nWeak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in three dimensions. We also explore the\nconstraints posed by modular invariance on a particular discrete $\\mathbb{Z}_N$\nsymmetry which arises in our discussion. In this case, modular invariance does\nnot guarantee the existence of light $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-charged states. We also\nhighlight the differences between our discussion and the usual heuristic\narguments for the WGC based on black hole remnants.\n", "  We show that a heavy fermion superconductor UPt_3 is a topological Weyl\nsuperconductor with tunable Weyl nodes. Adopting a generic order parameter in\nthe E_2u representation allowed by nonsymmorphic crystal symmetry, we clarify\nunusual gap structure and associated topological properties. The pair creation,\npair annihilation, and coalescence of Weyl nodes are demonstrated in the\ntime-reversal symmetry broken B-phase. At most 98 point nodes compatible with\nBlount's theorem give rise to line node-like behaviors in low-energy\nexcitations, consistent with experimental results. We also show an arc node\nprotected by the nonsymmorphic crystal symmetry on the Brillouin zone face.\n", "  We study the spectral function of the homogeneous electron gas using\nmany-body perturbation theory and the cumulant expansion. We compute the\nangle-resolved spectral function based on the GW approximation and the `GW plus\ncumulant' approach. In agreement with previous studies, the GW spectral\nfunction exhibits a spurious plasmaron peak at energies 1.5$\\omega_{\\rm pl}$\nbelow the quasiparticle peak, $\\omega_{\\rm pl}$ being the plasma energy. The GW\nplus cumulant approach, on the other hand, reduces significantly the intensity\nof the plasmon-induced spectral features and renormalizes their energy relative\nto the quasiparticle energy to $\\omega_{\\rm pl}$. Consistently with previous\nwork on semiconductors, our results show that the HEG is characterized by the\nemergence of plasmonic polaron bands, that is, broadened replica of the\nquasiparticle bands, red-shifted by the plasmon energy.\n", "  Photonic topological insulators are an interesting class of materials whose\nphotonic band structure can have a bandgap in the bulk while supporting\ntopologically protected unidirectional edge modes. Recent studies [1-6] on\nbianisotropic metamaterials that emulate the electronic quantum spin Hall\neffect using its electromagnetic analog are examples of such systems with\nrelatively simple and elegant design. In this paper, we present a rotating\nmagnetic dipole antenna, composed of two perpendicularly oriented coils, that\ncan efficiently excite the unidirectional topologically protected surface waves\nin the bianisotropic metawaveguide (BMW) structure recently realized by Ma, et\nal. [1], despite the fact that the BMW medium does not break time-reversal\ninvariance. In addition to achieving high directivity, the antenna can be tuned\ncontinuously to excite reflectionless edge modes to the two opposite directions\nwith various amplitude ratios. We demonstrate its performance through\nexperiment and compare to simulation results.\n", "  In recent years, some studies have drawn attention to the lack of large-angle\ncorrelations in the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature\nanisotropies with respect to that predicted within the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. Lately, it has been argued that such a lack of correlations could be\nexplained in the framework of the so-called $R_h=ct$ model without inflation.\nThe aim of this work is to study whether there is a mechanism to generate,\nthrough a quantum field theory, the primordial power spectrum presented by\nthese authors. Specifically, we consider two different scenarios: first, we\nassume a scalar field dominating the early Universe in the $R_h=ct$\ncosmological model, and second, we deal with the possibility of adding an early\ninflationary phase to the mentioned model. During the analysis of the\nconsistency between the predicted and observed amplitudes of the CMB\ntemperature anisotropies in both scenarios, we run into deep issues which\nindicate that it is not clear how to characterize the primordial quantum\nperturbations within the $R_h=ct$ model.\n", "  For many years chiral effective theory (ChEFT) has enabled and supported\nlattice QCD calculations of hadron observables by allowing systematic effects\nfrom unphysical lattice parameters to be controlled. In the modern era of\nprecision lattice simulations approaching the physical point, ChEFT techniques\nremain valuable tools. In this review we discuss the modern uses of ChEFT\napplied to lattice studies of hadron structure in the context of recent\ndeterminations of important and topical quantities. We consider muon g-2,\nstrangeness in the nucleon, the proton radius, nucleon polarizabilities, and\nsigma terms relevant to the prediction of dark-matter-hadron interaction\ncross-sections, among others.\n", "  We show that supersymmetry is a simple but powerful tool to exactly solve\nquantum mechanics problems. Here, the supersymmetric approach is used to\nanalyse a quantum system with periodic P\\\"oschl-Teller potential, and to find\nout the exact energy spectra and the corresponding band structure.\n", "  The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are\ncoherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a\nsuppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. Of recent\ninterest is the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting\nprocesses overlap (which is important for understanding corrections to standard\ntreatments of the LPM effect in QCD). In previous papers, we have developed\nmethods for computing such corrections without making soft-gluon\napproximations. However, our methods require consistent treatment of canceling\nultraviolet (UV) divergences associated with coincident emission times, even\nfor processes with tree-level amplitudes. In this paper, we show how to use\ndimensional regularization to properly handle the UV contributions. We also\npresent a simple diagnostic test that any consistent UV regularization method\nfor this problem needs to pass.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of ac response of superconducting quantum\nmetamaterials (SQMs), i.e. an array of qubits (two-levels system) embedded in\nthe low-dissipative resonator. By making use of a particular example of SQM,\nnamely the array of charge qubits capacitively coupled to the resonator, we\nobtain a second-order phase transition between an incoherent (the\nhigh-temperature phase) and coherent (the low-temperatures phase) states of\nphotons. This phase transition in many aspects resembles the\nparamagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition. The critical temperature of the\nphase transition, $T^\\star$, is determined by the energy splitting of two-level\nsystems $\\delta$, number of qubits in the array $N$, and the strength of the\ninteraction $\\eta$ between qubits and photons in the cavity. We obtain that the\nphoton states manifest themselves by resonant drops in the frequency dependent\ntransmission $D(\\omega)$ of electromagnetic waves propagating through a\ntransmission line weakly coupled to the SQM. At high temperatures the\n$D(\\omega)$ displays a single resonant drop, and at low temperatures a peculiar\n\\emph{double resonance response} has to be observed. The physical origin of\nsuch a resonant splitting is the quantum oscillations between two coherent\nstates of photons of different polarizations.\n", "  Recently, singlet-triplet measurements in double dots have emerged as a\npowerful tool in quantum information processing. In parallel, quantum dot\narrays are being envisaged as analog quantum simulators of many-body models.\nThus motivated, we explore the potential of the above singlet-triplet\nmeasurements for probing and exploiting the ground-state of a Heisenberg spin\nchain in such a quantum simulator. We formulate an efficient protocol to\ndiscriminate the achieved many-body ground-state with other likely states.\nMoreover, the transition between quantum phases, arising from the addition of\nfrustrations in a $J_1-J_2$ model, can be systematically explored using the\nsame set of measurements. We show that the proposed measurements have an\napplication in producing long distance heralded entanglement between well\nseparated quantum dots. Relevant noise sources, such as non-zero temperatures\nand nuclear spin interactions, are considered.\n", "  The high abundance of (anti-)deuterons in the statistics gathered in Run 1 of\nthe LHC and the excellent performance of the ALICE setup allow for the\nsimultaneous measurement of the elliptic flow and the deuteron production rates\nwith a large transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) reach. The (anti-) deuterons are\nidentified using the specific energy loss in the time projection chamber and\nthe velocity information in the time-of-flight detector. The elliptic flow of\n(anti-)deuterons can provide insight into the production mechanisms of\nparticles in heavy-ion collisions. Quark coalescence is one of the approaches\nto describe the elliptic flow of hadrons, while the production of light nuclei\ncan be also depicted as a coalescence of nucleons. In these proceedings, the\nmeasured $v_{2}$ of deuterons produced in Pb--Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$=2.76TeV will be compared to expectations from\ncoalescence and hydrodynamic models.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a driven optomechanical cavity coupled to a charged\nnanomechanical resonator via Coulomb interaction. We find the tunable switch\nbetween slow-and fast- light in double-mode can be observed from the output\nfield by adjusting the laser-cavity detuning in this coupled system. Moreover,\nthe requencies of signal light can be tuned by Coulomb coupling strength. The\nproposal may have potential application in optical communcation and nonlinear\noptics.\n", "  Ages are key to truly understand a large plethora of astrophysical phenomena.\nOn the other hand, stellar clusters are open windows to understand stellar\nevolution, specifically, the change with time and mass of different stellar\nproperties. As such, they are our laboratories where different theories can be\ntested, but without accurate ages, our knowledge would impaired. We revisit\nhere a large number of age-dating techniques and discuss their advantages and\ndraw-backs. In addition, a step-by step process is suggested in order to built\na coherent age scale ladder, minimizing the error budget and the sources of\nuncertainty.\n", "  This review summarises the main properties of Young Massive Clusters (YMCs),\nincluding their population properties, particularly focusing on extragalactic\ncluster samples. We discuss potential biases and caveats that can affect the\nconstruction of cluster samples and how incompleteness effects can result in\nerroneous conclusions regarding the long term survival of clusters. In addition\nto the luminosity, mass and age distributions of the clusters, we discuss the\nsize distribution and profile evolution of the clusters. We also briefly\ndiscuss the stellar populations within YMCs. The final part of the review\nfocusses on the connections between YMCs and the ancient globular clusters,\nwhether or not they are related objects and how we can use what we know about\nYMC formation and evolution to understand how GCs formed in the early universe\nand how they relate to galaxy formation/evolution.\n", "  We estimate the thermal width of a heavy quark anti-quark pair inside a\nstrongly coupled plasma using a holographic AdS/QCD model. The imaginary part\nof the quark potential that produces the thermal width appears in the gravity\ndual from quantum fluctuations of the string world sheet in the vicinity of the\nhorizon. The results, obtained using a soft wall background that involves an\ninfrared mass scale, are consistent with previous analisys where the mass scale\nwas introduced by averaging over quark anti-quark states.\n", "  We construct a new class of 4-dimensional z=2 Lifshitz black branes that have\na nonzero linear momentum. These are solutions of an Einstein-Proca-dilaton\nmodel that can be obtained by Scherk-Schwarz circle reduction of AdS_5 gravity\ncoupled to a free real scalar field. The boundary of a bulk Lifshitz space-time\nis a Newton-Cartan geometry. We show that the fluid dual to the moving Lifshitz\nblack brane leads to a novel form of Lifshitz hydrodynamics on a Newton-Cartan\nspace-time. Since the linear momentum of the black brane cannot be obtained by\na boost transformation the velocity of the fluid or rather, by boundary\nrotational invariance, its magnitude plays the role of a chemical potential.\nThe conjugate dual variable is mass density. The Lifshitz perfect fluid can be\nthought of as arising from a Schroedinger perfect fluid with broken particle\nnumber symmetry.\n", "  Conservation laws strongly influence production of particles in high-energy\nparticle collisions. Effects connected to these mechanisms were studied in\ndetails using correlation techniques in \\ee\\ collisions. At the time, models\nwere tuned to correctly reproduce the measurements. Similar studies for\nhadron-hadron collisions have never been performed, until recent ALICE\nmeasurements. ALICE has reported on studies of untriggered two-particle angular\ncorrelations of identified particles ($\\pi$, $K$, and p) measured in pp\ncollisions at center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=$ 7 TeV. Those preliminary\nresults confirm that also in hadron-hadron collisions, at much higher energies,\nconservation laws strongly influence the shape of the correlation functions for\ndifferent particle types and must be taken into account while analysing the\ndata. Moreover, they show that the contemporary models (PYTHIA, PHOJET) no\nlonger reproduce the experimental data well.\n", "  We study numerically the formation of cascading solitons when femtosecond\noptical pulses are launched into a fiber amplifier with less energy than\nrequired to form a soliton of equal duration. As the pulse is amplified,\ncascaded fundamental solitons are created at different distances, without\nsoliton fission, as each fundamental soliton moves outside the gain bandwidth\nthrough the Raman-induced spectral shifts. As a result, each input pulse\ncreates multiple, temporally separated, ultrashort pulses of different\nwavelengths at the amplifier output. The number of pulses depends not only on\nthe total gain of the amplifier but also on the width of input pulses.\n", "  We obtain new relations between Einstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) amplitudes\ninvolving N gauge bosons plus a single graviton and pure Yang-Mills amplitudes\ninvolving N gauge bosons plus one additional vector boson inserted in a way\ntypical for a gauge boson of a \"spectator\" group commuting with the group\nassociated to original N gauge bosons. We show that such EYM amplitudes satisfy\nU(1) decoupling relations similar to Kleiss-Kuijf relations for Yang-Mills\namplitudes. We consider a D-brane embedding of EYM amplitudes in the framework\nof disk amplitudes involving open and closed strings. A new set of monodromy\nrelations is derived for mixed open-closed amplitudes with one closed string\ninserted on the disk world-sheet and a number of open strings at the boundary.\nThese relations allow expressing the latter in terms of pure open string\namplitudes and, in the field-theory limit, they yield the U(1) decoupling\nrelations for EYM amplitudes.\n", "  We report results of a deep all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves\nfrom isolated neutron stars in data from the S6 LIGO science run. The search\nwas possible thanks to the computing power provided by the volunteers of the\nEinstein@Home distributed computing project. We find no significant signal\ncandidate and set the most stringent upper limits to date on the amplitude of\ngravitational wave signals from the target population. At the frequency of best\nstrain sensitivity, between $170.5$ and $171$ Hz we set a 90% confidence upper\nlimit of ${5.5}^{-25}$, while at the high end of our frequency range, around\n505 Hz, we achieve upper limits $\\simeq {10}^{-24}$. At $230$ Hz we can exclude\nsources with ellipticities greater than $10^{-6}$ within 100 pc of Earth with\nfiducial value of the principal moment of inertia of $10^{38} \\textrm{kg m}^2$.\nIf we assume a higher (lower) gravitational wave spindown we constrain farther\n(closer) objects to higher (lower) ellipticities.\n", "  In this brief note, we show that the residual symmetries that arise in the\nanalysis of the tensionless superstrings in the equivalent of the conformal\ngauge is (a trivial extension of) the recently discovered 3d Super\nBondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra, discussed in the context of asymptotic symmetries\nof 3d Supergravity in flat-spacetimes. This helps us uncover a limiting\napproach to the construction of the tensionless superstring from the point of\nview of the worldsheet, analogous to the one we had adopted earlier for the\nclosed tensionless bosonic string.\n", "  We present the first results from an on-going survey to characterize the\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) of the massive high-redshift galaxies detected as\nsubmillimeter galaxies (SMGs). We constructed a parent sample of 163 SMG-QSO\npairs with separations less than $\\sim$36 arcsec by cross-matching\nfar-infrared-selected galaxies from Herschel with spectroscopically confirmed\nQSOs. The Herschel sources were selected to match the properties of SMGs. We\ndetermined the sub-arcsecond positions of six Herschel sources with the Very\nLarge Array and obtained secure redshift identification for three of those with\nnear-infrared spectroscopy. The QSO sightlines probe transverse proper\ndistances of 112, 157, and 198 kpc at foreground redshifts of 2.043, 2.515, and\n2.184, respectively, which are comparable to the virial radius of the\n$\\sim10^{13}$ Msun halos expected to host SMGs. High-quality absorption-line\nspectroscopy of the QSOs reveals systematically strong HI Lyman-alpha\nabsorption around all three SMGs, with rest-frame equivalent widths of\n$\\sim2-3$ \\AA. However, none of the three absorbers exhibits compelling\nevidence for optically thick HI gas or metal absorption, in contrast to the\ndominance of strong neutral absorbers in the CGM of luminous $z \\sim 2$ QSOs.\nThe low covering factor of optically thick HI gas around SMGs tentatively\nindicates that SMGs may not have as prominent cool gas reservoirs in their\nhalos as the co-eval QSOs and that they may inhabit less massive halos than\npreviously thought.\n", "  Open clusters and associations are groups of young stars, respectively bound\nand unbound, that share the same origin and disperse over time into the\ngalactic field. As such, their formation and evolution are the key to\nunderstand the origin and properties of galactic stellar populations. Moreover,\nsince their members have about the same age, they are ideal laboratories to\nstudy the properties of young stars and constrain stellar evolution theories.\n  In this contribution, I present our current knowledge on open clusters and\nassociations. I focus on the methods used to derive the statistical properties\n(IMF, spatial distribution, IMF) of young stars and briefly discuss how they\ndepend on the environment. I then describe how open clusters can be used as\nprobes to investigate the structure, dynamics and chemical composition of the\nMilky Way. I conclude by presenting the Gaia mission and discuss how it will\nrevolutionize this field of research.\n", "  First-principles calculations combining density functional theory and\nmany-body perturbation theory can provide microscopic insight into the dynamics\nof electrons and phonons in materials. We review this theoretical and\ncomputational framework, focusing on perturbative treatments of scattering,\ndynamics and transport of coupled electrons and phonons. We discuss application\nof these first-principles calculations to electronics, lighting, spectroscopy\nand renewable energy.\n", "  In this paper, the classical Schr\\\"odinger equation, which allows the study\nof classical dynamics in terms of wave functions, is analyzed theoretically and\nnumerically. First, departing from classical (Newtonian) mechanics, and\nassuming an additional single-valued condition for the Hamilton's principal\nfunction, the classical Schr\\\"odinger equation is obtained. This additional\nassumption implies inherent non-classical features on the description of the\ndynamics obtained from the classical Schr\\\"odinger equation: the trajectories\ndo not cross in the configuration space. Second, departing from Bohmian\nmechanics and invoking the quantum-to-classical transition, the classical\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is obtained in a natural way for the center of mass of a\nquantum system with a large number of identical particles. This quantum\ndevelopment imposes the condition of dealing with a narrow wave packet, which\nimplicitly avoids the non-classical features mentioned above. We illustrate all\nthe above points with numerical simulations of the classical and quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger equations for different systems.\n", "  Recently one and two-parameter deformed Einstein equations have been studied\nfor extremal quantum black holes which have been proposed to obey deformed\nstatistics by Strominger. In this study, we give a deeper insight to the\ndeformed Einstein equations and consider the solutions of these equations for\nthe extremal quantum black holes. We then represent the implications of the\nsolutions, such that the deformation parameters lead the charged black holes to\nhave a smaller mass than the usual Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black holes. This\nreduction in mass of a usual black hole can be considered as a transition from\nclassical to quantum black hole regime.\n", "  Using a semi-classical model, we study the formation of highly excited\nneutral fragments during the fragmentation of $\\mathrm{H_3^+}$, a two-electron\ntriatomic molecule, driven by an intense near-IR laser field. To do so, we\nfirst formulate a microcanonical distribution for arbitrary one-electron\ntriatomic molecules. We then study frustrated double and single ionization in\nstrongly-driven $\\mathrm{H_3^+}$ and compute the kinetic energy release of the\nnuclei for these two processes. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of\nfrustrated ionization on the strength of the laser field as well as on the\ngeometry of the initial molecular state.\n", "  We report on hole compact double quantum dots fabricated using conventional\nCMOS technology. We provide evidence of Pauli spin blockade in the few hole\nregime which is relevant to spin qubit implementations.\n  A current dip is observed around zero magnetic field, in agreement with the\nexpected behavior for the case of strong spin-orbit. We deduce an intradot spin\nrelaxation rate $\\approx$120\\,kHz for the first holes, an important step\ntowards a robust hole spin-orbit qubit.\n", "  We study boundary renormalization group flows between boundary conformal\nfield theories in $1+1$ dimensions using methods of quantum information theory.\nWe define an entropic $g$-function for theories with impurities in terms of the\nrelative entanglement entropy, and we prove that this $g$-function decreases\nalong boundary renormalization group flows. This entropic $g$-theorem is valid\nat zero temperature, and is independent from the $g$-theorem based on the\nthermal partition function. We also discuss the mutual information in boundary\nRG flows, and how it encodes the correlations between the impurity and bulk\ndegrees of freedom. Our results provide a quantum-information understanding of\n(boundary) RG flow as increase of distinguishability between the UV fixed point\nand the theory along the RG flow.\n", "  Reconnection outflows are highly energetic directed flows that interact with\nthe ambient plasma or with flows from other reconnection regions. Under these\nconditions the flow becomes highly unstable and chaotic, as any flow jets\ninteracting with a medium. We report here massively parallel simulations of the\ntwo cases of interaction between outflow jets and between a single outflow with\nan ambient plasma. We find in both case the development of a chaotic magnetic\nfield, subject to secondary reconnection events that further complicate the\ntopology of the field lines. The focus of the present analysis is on the energy\nbalance. We compute each energy channel (electromagnetic, bulk, thermal, for\neach species) and find where the most energy is exchanged and in what form. The\nmain finding is that the largest energy exchange is not at the reconnection\nsite proper but in the regions where the outflowing jets are destabilized.\n", "  We propose a robust and highly efficient NMR technique to create singlet spin\norder from longitudinal spin magnetization in coupled spin-1/2 pairs and to\nperform backward conversion (singlet order)$\\to$magnetization. In this method\nwe exploit adiabatic switching of an RF-field in order to drive transitions\nbetween the singlet state and the $T_\\pm$ triplet states of a spin pair under\nstudy. We demonstrate that the method works perfectly for both strongly and\nweakly coupled spin pairs, providing a conversion efficiency between the\nsinglet spin order and magnetization, which is equal to the theoretical\nmaximum. We anticipate that the proposed technique is useful for generating\nlong-lived singlet order, for preserving spin hyperpolarization and for\nassessing singlet spin order in nearly equivalent spin pairs in specially\ndesigned molecules and in low-field NMR studies.\n", "  We demonstrate a convenient approach for simultaneously manipulating the\namplitude and polarization of light beams by means of the modulation of the\ncorrelation structure. As an illustration, we constructed a periodic\ncorrelation structure that can generate an arbitrary radially polarized array\n(RPA) beam of a radial or rectangular symmetry array in the focal plane from a\nradially polarized (RP) beam. The physical realizability conditions for such\nsource and the far-field beam condition are derived. It is illustrated that the\nbeamlet shape and the state of polarization (SOP) can be effectively controlled\nby the initial correlation structure and the coherence width. Furthermore, by\ndesigning the source correlation structure, a tunable OK-shaped RPA beam and an\noptical cage are demonstrated, which can find widespread applications in\nnon-destructive manipulation of particles and living biological cells. The\narbitrariness in the design of correlation structure prompted us to find more\nconvenient approaches for controlling the statistics of light beams in terms of\namplitude and polarization.\n", "  Torque is ubiquitous in many molecular systems, including collisions,\nchemical reactions, vibrations, electronic excitations and especially rotor\nmolecules. We present a straightforward theoretical method based on forces\nacting on atoms and obtained from atomistic quantum mechanics calculations, to\nquickly and qualitatively determine whether a molecule or sub-unit thereof has\na tendency to rotation and, if so, around which axis and in which sense:\nclockwise or counterclockwise. The method also indicates which atoms, if any,\nare predominant in causing the rotation. Our computational approach can in\ngeneral efficiently provide insights into the rotational ability of many\nmolecules and help to theoretically screen or modify them in advance of\nexperiments or before analyzing their rotational behavior in more detail with\nmore extensive computations guided by the results from the torque approach. As\nan example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a specific\nlight-driven molecular rotary motor which was successfully synthesized and\nanalyzed in prior experiments and simulations.\n", "  In the framework of our model of soft interactions at high energy based on\nCGC/saturation approach,we show that Bose-Einstein correlations of identical\ngluons lead to large values of $v_n$. We demonstrate how three dimensional\nscales of high energy interactions: hadron radius, typical size of the wave\nfunction in diffractive production of small masses (size of the constituent\nquark), and the saturation momentum, influence the values of BE correlations,\nand in particular, the values of $v_n$. Our calculation shows that the\nstructure of the `dressed' Pomeron leads to values of $v_n$ which are close to\nexperimental values for proton-proton scattering, 20\\% smaller than the\nobserved values for proton-lead collisions, and close to lead-lead collisions\nfor 0-10\\% centrality. Bearing this result in mind, we conclude that it is\npremature to consider, that the appearance of long range rapidity azimuthal\ncorrelations are due only to the hydrodynamical behaviour of the quark-gluon\nplasma.\n", "  We developed a theoretical model for the calculation of the main\ncharacteristics of pyroelectric response of pyroactive multilayer structures,\nwhich are basic elements of modern pyroelectric detectors of radiation and\nother transducers. In the framework of the proposed model, the dependences of\nthe pyroelectric response frequency spectra on the ferroelectric film thickness\nhave been investigated. It was found that a pronounced extrinsic size effect is\ninherent to the pyroelectric response frequency spectra, such as the strong\nthickness dependence of the response maximal value and its frequency position.\nThickness dependences of the frequency position of the pyroelectric response\nmaximum and the optimal thickness of the pyroactive ferroelectric film are\ncalculated. The frequency spectra of the pyroelectric current and voltage\ncalculated theoretically are in quantitative agreement with experimental ones\nfor Al/P(VDF-TrFE)/Ti/Si pyroactive structure. Developed procedure is important\nfor improving the sensitivity of pyroelectric devices. Obtained analytical\nexpressions allow us to optimize the performances of pyroactive elements using\nthe existence of the size effect, which depend on pyroactive layer and\nsubstrate thicknesses, as well as on the conditions of heat transfer and\nexchange at corresponding boundaries of the pyroactive structure.\n", "  We study Yang-Baxter deformations of the $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ superstring with\nnon-Abelian classical $r$-matrices which satisfy the homogeneous classical\nYang-Baxter equation (CYBE). By performing a supercoset construction, we can\nget deformed $AdS_5 \\times S^5$ backgrounds. While this is a new area of\nresearch, the current understanding is that Abelian classical $r$-matrices give\nrise to solutions of type IIB supergravity, while non-Abelian classical\n$r$-matrices lead to solutions of the generalized supergravity equations. We\nexamine here some examples of non-Abelian classical r-matrices and derive the\nassociated backgrounds explicitly. All of the resulting backgrounds satisfy the\ngeneralized equations. For some of them, we derive \"T-dualized\" backgrounds by\nadding a linear coordinate dependence to the dilaton and show that these\nsatisfy the usual type IIB supergravity equations. Remarkably, some of the\n\"T-dualized\" backgrounds are locally identical to undeformed $AdS_5 \\times S^5$\nafter an appropriate coordinate transformation, but this seems not to be\ngenerally the case.\n", "  The X-ray integral field unit for the Athena mission consists of a\nmicrocalorimeter transition edge sensor pixel array. Incoming photons generate\npulses which are analyzed in terms of energy, in order to assemble the X-ray\nspectrum. Usually this is done by means of optimal filtering in either time or\nfrequency domain.\n  In this paper we investigate an alternative method by means of principle\ncomponent analysis. This method attempts to find the main components of an\northogonal set of functions to describe the data.\n  We show, based on simulations, what the influence of various instrumental\neffects is on this type of analysis. We compare analyses both in time and\nfrequency domain. Finally we apply these analyses on real data, obtained via\nfrequency domain multiplexing readout.\n", "  We propose and analyse a mathematical measure for the amount of squeezing\ncontained in a continuous variable quantum state. We show that the proposed\nmeasure operationally quantifies the minimal amount of squeezing needed to\nprepare a given quantum state and that it can be regarded as a squeezing\nanalogue of the \"entanglement of formation\". We prove that the measure is\nconvex and superadditive and we provide analytic bounds as well as a numerical\nconvex optimisation algorithm for its computation. By example, we then show\nthat the amount of squeezing needed for the preparation of certain multi-mode\nquantum states can be significantly lower than naive approaches suggest.\n", "  The Wide Field Imager (WFI) is one of two instruments for the Advanced\nTelescope for High-ENergy Astrophysics (Athena). In this paper we summarise\nthree of the many key science objectives for the WFI - the formation and growth\nof supermassive black holes, non-gravitational heating in clusters of galaxies,\nand spin measurements of stellar mass black holes - and describe their\ntranslation into the science requirements and ultimately instrument\nrequirements. The WFI will be designed to provide excellent point source\nsensitivity and grasp for performing wide area surveys, surface brightness\nsensitivity, survey power, and absolute temperature and density calibration for\nin-depth studies of the outskirts of nearby clusters of galaxies and very good\nhigh-count rate capability, throughput, and low pile-up, paired with very good\nspectral resolution, for detailed explorations of bright Galactic compact\nobjects.\n", "  A random search is a stochastic process representing the random motion of a\nparticle (denoted as the searcher) that is terminated when it reaches (detects)\na target particle or area the first time. In intermittent search the random\nmotion alternates between two or more motility modes, one of which is\nnon-detecting. An example is the slow diffusive motion as the detecting mode\nand fast, directed ballistic motion as the non-detecting mode, which can lead\nto much faster detection than a purely diffusive search. The transition rate\nbetween the diffusive and the ballistic mode (and back) together with the\nprobability distribution of directions for the ballistic motion defines a\nsearch strategy. If these transition rates and/or probability distributions\ndepend on the spatial coordinates within the search domain it is a spatially\ninhomogeneous search strategy, if both are constant, it is a homogeneous one.\nHere we study the efficiency, measured in terms of the mean first-passage time,\nof spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous search strategies for three\nparadigmatic search problems: 1) the narrow escape problem, where the searcher\nhas to find a small area on the boundary of the search domain, 2) reaction\nkinetics, which involves the detection of an immobile target in the interior of\na search domain, and 3) the reaction-escape problem, where the searcher first\nneeds to find a diffusive target before it can escape through a narrow region\non the boundary. Using families of spatially inhomogeneous search strategies,\npartially motivated by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton in living\ncells with a centrosome, we show that they can be made almost always more\nefficient than homogeneous strategies.\n", "  Recent observational progress has led to the establishment of the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model for cosmology. This development is based on different\ncosmological probes that are usually combined through their likelihoods at the\nlatest stage in the analysis. We implement here an integrated scheme for\ncosmological probes, which are combined in a common framework starting at the\nmap level. This treatment is necessary as the probes are generally derived from\noverlapping maps and are thus not independent. It also allows for a thorough\ntest of the cosmological model and of systematics through the consistency of\ndifferent physical tracers. As a first application, we combine current\nmeasurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the Planck\nsatellite, and galaxy clustering and weak lensing from SDSS. We consider the\nspherical harmonic power spectra of these probes including all six auto- and\ncross-correlations along with the associated full Gaussian covariance matrix.\nThis provides an integrated treatment of different analyses usually performed\nseparately including CMB anisotropies, cosmic shear, galaxy clustering,\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect with galaxy\nand shear tracers. We derive constraints on $\\Lambda$CDM parameters that are\ncompatible with existing constraints and highlight tensions between data sets,\nwhich become apparent in this integrated treatment. We discuss how this\napproach provides a complete and powerful integrated framework for probe\ncombination and how it can be extended to include other tracers in the context\nof current and future wide field cosmological surveys.\n", "  Quantum field theory - our basic framework for describing all\nnon-gravitational physics - conflicts with general relativity: the latter\nprecludes the standard definition of the former's essential principle of\nlocality, in terms of commuting local observables. We examine this conflict\nmore carefully, by investigating implications of gauge (diffeomorphism)\ninvariance for observables in gravity. We prove a dressing theorem, showing\nthat any operator with nonzero Poincare charges, and in particular any\ncompactly-supported operator, in flat-spacetime quantum field theory must be\ngravitationally dressed once coupled to gravity, i.e. it must depend on the\nmetric at arbitrarily long distances, and we put lower bounds on this nonlocal\ndependence. This departure from standard locality occurs in the most severe way\npossible: in perturbation theory about flat spacetime, at leading order in\nNewton's constant. The physical observables in a gravitational theory therefore\ndo not organize themselves into local commuting subalgebras: the principle of\nlocality must apparently be reformulated or abandoned, and in fact we lack a\nclear definition of the coarser and more basic notion of a quantum subsystem of\nthe Universe. We discuss relational approaches to locality based on\ndiffeomorphism-invariant nonlocal operators, and reinforce arguments that any\nsuch locality is state-dependent and approximate. We also find limitations to\nthe utility of bilocal diffeomorphism-invariant operators that are considered\nin cosmological contexts. An appendix provides a concise review of the\ncanonical covariant formalism for gravity, instrumental in the discussion of\nPoincare charges and their associated long-range fields.\n", "  A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is built to study the properties of\nthe strongly interacting matter created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.\nWith the upgrade of its Inner Tracking System (ITS), the ALICE experiment is\ngoing to increase the rate of data taking by almost two orders of magnitude. At\nthe same time, the precision of secondary vertex reconstruction will become by\nat least a factor 3 better than it currently is. In this talk, we briefly show\nsome selected physics results motivating the upgrade of the ITS, describe the\ndesign goals and the layout of the new detector, and highlight a few important\nmeasurements that will be realized after the completion of this upgrade.\n", "  Based on a recent claim [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 127203 (2016)] that electron\nvortex can be used to image magnetism at the nanoscale in elastic scattering\nexperiments, using transmission electron microscopy, a comprehensive\ncomputational study is performed to study magnetic effects in the paraxial\nregime of elastic electron scattering in magnetic solids. Magnetic interactions\nfrom electron vortex beams, spin polarized electron beams and beams with phase\naberrations are considered, as they pass through ferromagnetic FePt or\nantiferromagnetic LaMnAsO. The magnetic signals are obtained by comparing the\nintensity over a disk in the diffraction plane for beams with opposite angular\nmomentum or aberrations. The strongest magnetic signals are obtained from\nvortex beams with large orbital angular momentum, where relative magnetic\nsignals above $10^{-3}$ are indicated for $10\\hbar$ orbital angular momentum,\nmeaning that relative signals of one percent could be expected with the even\nlarger orbital angular momenta, which have been produced in experimental\nsetups. All results indicate that beams with low acceleration voltage and small\nconvergence angles yield stronger magnetic signals, which is unfortunately\nproblematic for the possibility of high spatial resolution imaging.\nNevertheless, under atomic resolution conditions, relative magnetic signals in\nthe order of $10^{-4}$ are demonstrated, corresponding to an increase with one\norder of magnitude compared to previous work.\n", "  The quantum group $SU_q(3)=U_q(su(3))$ is taken as a baryon flavor symmetry.\nAccounting for electromagnetic contributions to baryons masses to zeroth order,\nnew charge specific $q$-deformed octet and decuplet baryon mass formulas are\nobtained. These new mass relations have errors of only 0.02\\% and 0.08\\%\nrespectively; a factor of 20 reduction compared to the standard Gell-Mann-Okubo\nmass formulas. A new relation between the octet and decuplet baryon masses that\nis accurate to 1.2\\% is derived. An explicit formula for the Cabibbo angle,\ntaken to be $\\frac{\\pi}{14}$, in terms of the deformation parameter $q$ and\nspin parity $J^P$ of the baryons is obtained.\n", "  Conserved directed-percolation (C-DP) and the depinning transition of a\ndisordered elastic interface belong to the same universality class as has been\nproven very recently by Le Doussal and Wiese [Phys. Rev. Lett.~\\textbf{114},\n110601 (2015)] through a mapping of the field theory for C-DP onto that of the\nquenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. Here, we present an alternative derivation of\nthe C-DP field theoretic functional, starting with the coherent state path\nintegral formulation of the C-DP and then applying the\nGrassberger-transformation, that avoids the disadvantages of the so-called\nDoi-shift. We revisit the aforementioned mapping with focus on a specific term\nin the field theoretic functional that has been problematic in the past when it\ncame to assessing its relevance. We show that this term is redundant in the\nsense of the renormalization group.\n", "  We construct renormalizable Standard Model extensions, valid up to the Planck\nscale, that give a composite Higgs from a new fundamental strong force acting\non fermions and scalars. Yukawa interactions of these particles with Standard\nModel fermions realize the partial compositeness scenario. Under certain\nassumptions on the dynamics of the scalars, successful models exist because\ngauge quantum numbers of Standard Model fermions admit a minimal enough 'square\nroot'. Furthermore, right-handed SM fermions have an SU(2)$_R$-like structure,\nyielding a custodially-protected composite Higgs. Baryon and lepton numbers\narise accidentally. Standard Model fermions acquire mass at tree level, while\nthe Higgs potential and flavor violations are generated by quantum corrections.\nWe further discuss accidental symmetries and other dynamical features stemming\nfrom the new strongly interacting scalars. If the same phenomenology can be\nobtained from models without our elementary scalars, they would reappear as\ncomposite states.\n", "  We present a general analysis of exchange devices linking their efficiency to\nthe geometry of the exchange surface and supply network. For certain parameter\nranges, we show that the optimal exchanger consists of densely packed pipes\nwhich can span a thin sheet of large area (an `active layer'), which may be\ncrumpled into a fractal surface and supplied with a fractal network of pipes.\nWe derive the efficiencies of such exchangers, showing the potential for\nsignificant gains compared to regular exchangers (where the active layer is\nflat), using parameters relevant for biological systems.\n", "  We study the circular photogalvanic effect in the organometal halide\nperovskite solar cell absorber CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$. For crystal structures\nwhich lack inversion symmetry, the calculated photocurrent density is about\n$10^{-9}$ A/W, comparable to the previously studied quantum well and bulk\nRashba systems. Because of the dependence of the circular photogalvanic effect\non inversion symmetry breaking, the degree of inversion asymmetry at different\ndepths from the surface can be probed by tuning the photon energy and\nassociated penetration depth. We propose that measurements of this effect may\nclarify the presence or absence of inversion symmetry, which remains a\ncontroversial issue and has been argued to play an important role in the high\nconversion efficiency of this material.\n", "  Early quiescent galaxies at z~2 are known to be remarkably compact compared\nto their nearby counterparts. Possible progenitors of these systems include\ngalaxies that are structurally similar, but are still rapidly forming stars.\nHere, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the\nCO(1-0) line towards three such compact, star-forming galaxies at z~2.3,\nsignificantly detecting one. The VLA observations indicate baryonic gas\nfractions >~5 times lower and gas depletion times >~10 times shorter than\nnormal, extended massive star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. At their\ncurrent star formation rates, all three objects will deplete their gas\nreservoirs within 100Myr. These objects are among the most gas-poor objects\nobserved at z>2, and are outliers from standard gas scaling relations, a result\nwhich remains true regardless of assumptions about the CO-H2 conversion factor.\nOur observations are consistent with the idea that compact, star-forming\ngalaxies are in a rapid state of transition to quiescence in tandem with the\nbuild-up of the z~2 quenched population. In the detected compact galaxy, we see\nno evidence of rotation or that the CO-emitting gas is spatially extended\nrelative to the stellar light. This casts doubt on recent suggestions that the\ngas in these compact galaxies is rotating and significantly extended compared\nto the stars. Instead, we suggest that, at least for this object, the gas is\ncentrally concentrated, and only traces a small fraction of the total galaxy\ndynamical mass.\n", "  We numerically construct asymptotically $AdS$ black brane solutions of $D=4$\nEinstein theory coupled to a scalar and two $U(1)$ gauge fields. The solutions\nare holographically dual to $d=3$ CFTs in a constant external magnetic field\nalong one of the $U(1)$'s. Below a critical temperature the system's\nmagnetisation density becomes inhomogeneous, leading to spontaneous formation\nof current density waves. We find that the transition can be of second order\nand that the solutions which minimise the free energy locally in the parameter\nspace of solutions have averaged stressed tensor of a perfect fluid.\n", "  From experimental and theoretical analyses of magnetic and specific-heat\nproperties, we present the complete magnetic phase diagram of the\nquasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet Cu(N$_2$H$_5$)$_2$(SO$_4$)$_2$. On\ncooling and at zero magnetic field this compound enters a one-dimensional\nregime with short-range magnetic correlations, marked by a broad maximum in the\nspecific heat and magnetic susceptibility at $T_\\mathrm{max}\\sim\n2\\,\\mathrm{K}$, followed by an ordered antiferromagnetic phase below\n$T_\\mathrm{N}\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{K}$ induced by small interchain couplings. The\nintermediate-temperate one-dimensional regime can be modeled using exact\nquantum-transfer-matrix calculations, which perfectly describe the nonmonotonic\nbehavior of T_max as a function of the magnetic field, giving $J =\n4.25\\,\\mathrm{K}$ for the intrachain exchange parameter. The analysis of\nmagnetic specific-heat and susceptibility data at low temperature indicates\nthat the interchain exchange couplings are an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe coupling inside the chains.\n", "  Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we examine how an\nexternally applied strong magnetic impacts proton acceleration in\nlaser-irradiated solid-density targets. We find that a kT-level external\nmagnetic field can sufficiently inhibit transverse transport of hot electrons\nin a flat laser-irradiated target. While the electron heating by the laser\nremains mostly unaffected, the reduced electron transport during proton\nacceleration leads to an enhancement of maximum proton energies and the overall\nnumber of energetic protons. The resulting proton beam is much better\ncollimated compared to a beam generated without applying a kT-level magnetic\nfield. A factor of three enhancement of the laser energy conversion efficiency\ninto multi-MeV protons is another effect of the magnetic field. The required kT\nmagnetic fields are becoming feasible due to a significant progress that has\nbeen made in generating magnetic fields with laser-driven coils using ns-long\nlaser pulses. The predicted improved characteristics of laser-driven proton\nbeams would be critical for a number of applications.\n", "  Recently, we proposed a new approach using a punctured Elliptic curve in the\nCHY framework in order to compute one-loop scattering amplitudes. In this note,\nwe further develop this approach by introducing a set of connectors, which\nbecome the main ingredient to build integrands on $\\mathfrak{M}_{1,n}$, the\nmoduli space of n-punctured Elliptic curves. As a particular application, we\nstudy the $\\Phi^3$ bi-adjoint scalar theory. We propose a set of rules to\nconstruct integrands on $\\mathfrak{M}_{1,n}$ from $\\Phi^ 3$ integrands on\n$\\mathfrak{M}_{0,n}$, the moduli space of n-punctured spheres. We illustrate\nthese rules by computing a variety of $\\Phi^3$ one-loop Feynman diagrams.\nConversely, we also provide another set of rules to compute the corresponding\nCHY-integrand on $\\mathfrak{M}_{1,n}$ by starting instead from a given $\\Phi^\n3$ one-loop Feynman diagram. In addition, our results can easily be extended to\nhigher loops.\n", "  We have been investigating the problem of the Anderson localization in a\ndisordered one dimensional tight-binding model. The disorder is created by the\ninteraction of mobile particles with other species, immobilized at random\npositions. We introduce a novel method of creating correlations in the optical\nlattices with such a kind of disorder by using two different lattices with\ncommensurate lattice lengths to hold two species of the particles. Such a\nmodel, called the generalized random $N$-mer model leads to the appearance of\nmultiple extended states in contrary to a localization of all states usually\nexpected in one dimension. We develop a method, based on properties of transfer\nmatrices which can be used to determine the presence of extended states and\ntheir energies for that class of correlations. Analytical results are compared\nwith the numerical calculations for several cases which can be realized in\ncold-atom experiments.\n", "  The magnetic system of the Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ge solid solution is ordered in\na spiral spin structure in the whole concentration range of $x \\in [0 \\div 1]$.\nThe close inspection of the small-angle neutron scattering data reveals the\nquantum phase transition from the long-range ordered (LRO) to short range\nordered (SRO) helical structure upon increase of Fe-concentration at $x \\in\n[0.25 \\div 0.4]$. The SRO of the helical structure is identified as a\nLorentzian contribution, while LRO is associated with the Gaussian contribution\ninto the scattering profile function. The scenario of the quantum phase\ntransition with $x$ as a driving parameter is similar to the thermal phase\ntransition in pure MnGe. The quantum nature of the SRO is proved by the\ntemperature independent correlation length of the helical structure at low and\nintermediate temperature ranges with remarkable decrease above certain\ntemperature $T_Q$. We suggest the $x$-dependent modification of the effective\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange interaction within the Heisenberg model\nof magnetism to explain the quantum critical regime in Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$Ge.\n", "  The generalized solution for the warp factor of the Randall-Sundrum metric is\npresented which is symmetric with respect to both branes and explicitly\nperiodic in extra variable. Given that the curvature of the 5-dimensional\nspace-time is small, the expected rate of neutrino-induced inclined events at\nthe Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory is calculated. Both the\n\"downward-going\" (DG) and \"Earth-skimming\" (ES) neutrinos are considered. By\ncomparing the expected event rate with the recent Auger data on searching for\nneutrino candidates, the lower bound on the fundamental gravity scale M_5 is\nobtained. The ratio of the number of the ES air showers to the number of the DG\nshowers is estimated as a function of M_5.\n", "  The impact of reduced dimensionality on the magnetic properties of the\ntetragonal L1$_{0}$ CoPt alloy is investigated from ab-initio considering\nseveral kinds of surface defects. By exploring the dependence of the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) on the thickness of CoPt thin films,\nwe demonstrate the crucial role of the chemical nature of the surface. For\ninstance, Pt-terminated thin films exhibit huge MAEs which can be 1000% larger\nthan those of Co-terminated films. Besides the perfect thin films, we\nscrutinize the effect of defective surfaces such as stacking faults or\nanti-sites on the surface layers. Both types of defects reduce considerably the\nMAE with respect to the one obtained for Pt-terminated thin films. A detailed\nanalysis of the electronic structure of the thin films is provided with a\ncareful comparison to the CoPt bulk case. The behavior of the MAEs is then\nrelated to the location of the different virtual bound states utilising second\norder perturbation theory.\n", "  We examine a non-reversible, mean-field Potts model with three spins on a set\nwith $N\\uparrow\\infty$ points. Without an external field, there are three\ncritical temperatures and five different metastable regimes. The analysis can\nbe extended by a perturbative argument to the case of small external fields. We\nillustrate the case of large external fields with some phenomena which are not\npresent in the absence of external field.\n", "  Motivated by the continuous experimental investigations of $X(1835)$ in\nthree-body decay channels like $\\eta^\\prime \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, we investigate the\n$\\eta^\\prime K \\bar K$ system with the aim of searching for bound states and/or\nresonances when the dynamics involved in the $K\\bar K$ subsystem can form the\nresonances: $f_0(980)$ in isospin 0 or $a_0(980)$ in isospin 1. For this, we\nsolve the Faddeev equations for the three-body system. The input two-body\n$t$-matrices are obtained by solving Bethe-Salpeter equations in a coupled\nchannel formalism. As a result, no signal of a three-body bound state or\nresonance is found.\n", "  Foreshock disturbances -- large-scale (~1000 km to >30,000 km), transient\n(~5-10 per day - lasting ~10s of seconds to several minutes) structures [1,2] -\ngenerated by suprathermal (>100 eV to 100s of keV) ions [3,4] arise upstream of\nEarth's bow shock formed by the solar wind colliding with the Earth's\nmagnetosphere. They have recently been found to accelerate ions to energies of\nseveral keV [5,6]. Although electrons in Saturn's high Mach number (M > 40) bow\nshock can be accelerated to relativistic energies (nearly 1000 keV) [7], it has\nhitherto been thought impossible to accelerate electrons at the much weaker (M\n< 20) Earth's bow shock beyond a few 10s of keV [8]. Here we report\nobservations of electrons energized by foreshock disturbances to energies up to\nat least ~300 keV. Although such energetic electrons have been previously\nreported, their presence has been attributed to escaping magnetospheric\nparticles [9,10] or solar events [11]. These relativistic electrons are not\nassociated with any solar activity nor are they of magnetospheric origin.\nFurther, current theories of ion acceleration in foreshock disturbances cannot\naccount for electrons accelerated to the observed relativistic energies\n[12-17]. These electrons are clearly coming from the disturbances, leaving us\nwith no explanation as to their origin.\n", "  The symplectic analysis of a four dimensional $BF$ theory in the context of\nthe Faddeev-Jackiw symplectic approach is performed. It is shown that this\nmethod is more economical than Dirac's formalism. In particular, the complete\nset of Faddeev-Jackiw constraints and the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets\nare reported. In addition, we show that the generalized Faddeev-Jackiw brackets\nand the Dirac ones coincide to each other. Finally, the similarities and\nadvantages between Faddeev-Jackiw method and Dirac's formalism are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Extensions of the standard model with universal extra dimensions are\ninteresting both as phenomenological templates as well as model-building\nfertile ground. For instance, they are one the prototypes for theories\nexhibiting compressed spectra, leading to difficult searches at the LHC since\nthe decay products of new states are soft and immersed in a large standard\nmodel background. Here we study the phenomenology at the LHC of theories with\ntwo universal extra dimensions. We obtain the current bound by using the\nproduction of second level excitations of electroweak gauge bosons decaying to\na pair of leptons and study the reach of the LHC Run~II in this channel. We\nalso introduce a new channel originating in higher dimensional operators and\nresulting in the single production of a second level quark excitation. Its\nsubsequent decay into a hard jet and lepton pair resonance would allow the\nidentification of a more model-specific process, unlike the more generic vector\nresonance signal. We show that the sensitivity of this channel to the\ncompactification scale is very similar to the one obtained using the vector\nresonance.\n", "  Simple cubic and body centered cubic ferromagnetic lattices with four layers\nwere studied using Heisenberg Hamiltonian. According to 3-D plots, the films\nwith four layers can be easily oriented in certain directions under the\ninfluence of particular demagnetization factor and angles for both sc(001) and\nbcc(001) ferromagnetic lattice structures. A flat part can be seen in the\nmiddle of 3-D plots in addition to periodic variations. When the\ndemagnetization factor is given by =6, sc(001) film with four layers can be\neasily oriented in 0.6 radians direction for the energy parameter values used\nin this simulation. Under the influence of demagnetization factor given by =5.2\n, thin film of bcc(001) lattice with four layers can be easily oriented along\n0.63 radians direction.\n", "  Second order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian was employed to investigate the\nmagnetic properties of hexagonal Cobalt films. Initially the number of nearest\nneighbors and the constants arisen from the partial summation of the dipole\ninteractions of the structure of cobalt were calculated using some special\nalgorithms. Minimization of the energy difference between the easy and hard\ndirection of a memory device is very important. When the energy difference\nbetween the easy and hard directions is significantly small, the magnetic\nmoments in a memory device can be quickly rotated between easy and hard\ndirections under the influence of a small magnetic field. The thickness of a\ncobalt film corresponding to this minimum energy difference calculated using\nthis theoretical model agrees with some experimental data of cobalt based\nmagnetic memory devices.\n", "  Magnetic properties and easy axis orientation of cobalt ferrite films with\napplied magnetic field and number of layers were studied. According to our\ntheoretical studies explained in this manuscript, the magnetically easy and\nhard directions of cobalt ferrite films solely depend on in plane and out of\nplane magnetic fields. According to 3-D and 2-D plots, there are many easy and\nhard directions at one particular value of in plane or out of plane magnetic\nfield. The magnetic properties were investigated for cobalt ferrite films with\nthickness up to 10,000 unit cells. The total magnetic energy was calculated for\na unit spin of cobalt.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of qubits consisting of three electron spins in\ndouble and triple quantum dots subject to external electric fields. Our model\nincludes two independent bias parameters, $\\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon_{M}$,\nwhich both couple to external electromagnetic fields and can be controlled by\ngate voltages applied to the quantum dot structures. By varying these\nparameters one can switch the qubit type by shifting the energies in the single\nquantum dots thus changing the electron occupancy in each dot. Starting from\nthe asymmetric resonant (ARX) exchange qubit with a (2,0,1) and (1,0,2) charge\nadmixture one can smoothly cross over to the resonant exchange (RX) qubit with\na detuned (1,1,1) charge configuration, and to the exchange-only (EO) qubit\nwith the same charge configuration but equal energy levels down to the hybrid\nqubits with (1,2,0) and (0,2,1) charge configurations. Here, ($l,m,n$)\ndescribes a configuration with $l$ electrons in the left dot, $m$ electrons in\nthe center dot, and $n$ electrons in the right dot. We first focus on random\nelectromagnetic field fluctuations, i.e., \"charge noise\", at each quantum dot\nresulting in dephasing of the qubit and provide a complete map of the resulting\ndephasing time as a function of the bias parameters. We pay special attention\nto the so-called sweet spots and double sweet spots of the system which are\nleast susceptible to noise. In the second part we investigate the coupling of\nthe qubit system to the coherent quantized electromagnetic field in a\nsuperconducting strip-line cavity and also provide a complete map of the\ncoupling strength as a function of the bias parameters. We analyze the\nasymmetric qubit-cavity coupling via $\\varepsilon$ and the symmetric coupling\nvia $\\varepsilon_{M}$.\n", "  We study the generation of THz radiation from the acceleration of ultrafast\nphotoexcited charge carriers in graphene in the presence of a DC electric\nfield. Our model is based on calculating the transient current density from the\ntime-dependent distribution function which is determined using the Boltzmann\ntransport equation within a relaxation time approximation. We include the\ntime-dependent generation of carriers by the pump pulse by solving for the\ncarrier generation rate using the Bloch equations in the rotating wave\napproximation (RWA). The linearly polarized pump pulse generates an anisotropic\ndistribution of photoexcited carriers in the $k_x-k_y$ plane. The collision\nintegral in the Boltzmann equation includes a term that leads to the\n\\textit{thermalization} of carriers via carrier-carrier scattering to an\neffective temperature above the lattice temperature, as well as a\n\\textit{cooling} term which leads to energy relaxation via inelastic\ncarrier-phonon scattering. The radiated signal is proportional to the time\nderivative of the transient current density. In spite of the fact that the\nmagnitude of the velocity is the same for all the carriers in graphene, there\nis still emitted radiation from the photoexcited charge carriers with frequency\ncomponents in the THz range due to a change in the \\textit{direction} of\nvelocity of the photoexcited carriers in the external electric field as well as\n\\textit{cooling} of the photoexcited carriers on a sub-picosecond time scale.\n", "  There has been increasing interest in making the photonic devices more and\nmore compact in the integrated photonics industry, and one of the important\nquestions for manufacturers and design engineers is how to quantify the effect\nof the finite cladding thickness on the modal confinement loss of photonic\nwaveguides. This requires at least six to seven digits accuracy for the\ncomputation of propagation constant $\\beta$ since the modal confinement loss is\nproportional to the imaginary part of $\\beta$ that is six to seven orders of\nmagnitude smaller than its real part by the industrial standard. In this paper,\nwe present an accurate and efficient method to compute the propagation constant\nof electromagnetic modes of photonic waveguides with arbitrary number of\n(nonsmooth) inclusions in a layered media. The method combines a\nwell-conditioned boundary integral equation formulation for photonic waveguides\nwhich requires the discretization of the material interface only, and efficient\nSommerfeld integral representations to treat the effect of the layered medium.\nOur scheme is capable of calculating the propagation loss of the\nelectromagnetic modes with high fidelity, even for waveguides with corners\nimbedded in a cladding material of finite thickness. The numerical results,\nwith more than $10$-digit accuracy, show quantitatively that the modal\nconfinement loss of the rectangular waveguide increases exponentially fast as\nthe cladding thickness decreases.\n", "  Due to their long mean free paths, X-rays are expected to have many\nsignificant impacts globally on the properties of the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) by their heating and ionizing processes on large scales. At high\nredshifts, X-rays from Population (Pop) III binaries might have important\neffects on cosmic reionization and the Lyman alpha forest. As a continuation of\nour previous work on Pop III binary X-rays (Xu et al. 2014), we use the Pop III\ndistribution and evolution from the Renaissance Simulations, a suite of\nself-consistent cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations of the\nformation of the first galaxies, to calculate the X-ray luminosity density and\nbackground over the redshift range 20 > z > 7.6. As we find that Pop III star\nformation continues at a low, nearly constant rate to the end of reionization,\nX-rays are being continuously produced at significant rates compared to other\npossible X-ray sources, such as AGNs and normal X-ray binaries during the same\nperiod of time. We estimate that Pop III binaries produce approximately 6 eV of\nenergy in the X-rays per hydrogen atom. We calculate the X-ray background for\ndifferent monochromatic photon energies. KeV X-rays redshift and accumulate to\nproduce a strong X-ray background spectrum extending to roughly 500 eV. The\nX-ray background is strong enough to heat the IGM to ~ 1000 K and to ionize a\nfew percent of the neutral hydrogen. These effects are important for an\nunderstanding of the neutral hydrogen hyperfine transition 21-cm line\nsignatures, the Ly alpha forest, and optical depth of the CMB to Thomson\nscattering.\n", "  We analyze flow of non-Newtonian fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell, subjected to\nspatially non-uniform electroosmotic slip. Motivated by their potential use for\nincreasing the characteristic pressure fields, we specifically focus on\npower-law fluids with wall depletion properties. We derive a p-Poisson equation\ngoverning the pressure field, as well as a set of linearized equations\nrepresenting its asymptotic approximation for weakly non-Newtonian behavior. To\ninvestigate the effect of non-Newtonian properties on the resulting fluidic\npressure and velocity, we consider several configurations in one- and\ntwo-dimensions, and calculate both exact and approximate solutions. We show\nthat the asymptotic approximation is in good agreement with exact solutions\neven for fluids with significant non-Newtonian behavior, allowing its use in\nthe analysis and design of microfluidic systems involving electro-kinetic\ntransport of such fluids.\n", "  \\item[Background]Heavy-ion reactions from barrier up to Fermi energy.\n\\item[Purpose]Reaction and fusion cross sections determination. Fusion\nreactions induced by $^{129}Xe$ projectiles on $^{nat}Sn$ targets for energies\nranging from $8$ A.MeV to $35$ A.MeV were measured with the INDRA\n$4\\pi$-array.\\\\ The evaluation of the fusion/incomplete fusion cross sections\nfor the incident energies from 8 to 35 A.MeV is the main purpose of this paper.\n\\item[Method] The reaction cross sections are evaluated for each beam energy\nthanks to INDRA $4\\pi$-array. The events are also sorted in order to focus the\nstudy on a selected sample of events, in such a way that the fusion/fusion\nincomplete cross section is estimated. \\item[Results] The excitation function\nof reaction and fusion cross sections were measured for the heavy and nearly\nsymmetric system $^{129}Xe + ^{nat}Sn$ from 8 to 35 A.MeV.\n  \\item[Conclusions] The fusion-like cross-sections evaluated show a good\nagrement with a recent systematics for beam energies greater than 20 A.MeV. For\nlow beam energies the cross-section values are lower than the expected ones. A\nprobable reason for these low values is in the fusion hindrance at energies\nabove/close the barrier.\n", "  In the iron-based superconductors (FeSCs), orbital differentiation is an\nimportant phenomenon, whereby correlations stronger on the dxy orbital than on\nthe dxz/yz orbital yield quasi-particles with dxy} orbital character having\nlarger mass renormalization and abnormal temperature evolution. However, the\nphysical origin of this orbital differentiation is debated between the Hund's\ncoupling induced unbinding of spin and orbital degrees of freedom and the\nHubbard interaction instigated orbital selective Mott transition. Here we use\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to identify an orbital-dependent\ncorrelation-induced quasi-particle (QP) anomaly in LiFeAs. The excellent\nagreement between our photoemission measurements and first-principles many-body\ntheory calculations shows that the orbital-differentiated QP lifetime anomalies\nin LiFeAs are controlled by the Hund's coupling.\n", "  A recent, intriguing paper by Hawking, Perry and Strominger suggests that\nsoft photons and gravitons can be regarded as black hole hair and may be\nrelevant to the black hole information paradox. In this note we make use of\nfactorization theorems for infrared divergences of the S-matrix to argue that\nby appropriately dressing in and out hard states, the soft-quanta-dependent\npart of the S-matrix becomes essentially trivial. The information paradox can\nbe fully formulated in terms of dressed hard states, which do not depend on\nsoft quanta.\n", "  We demonstrate that the terahertz/infrared radiation induced photogalvanic\neffect, which is sensitive to the surface symmetry and scattering details, can\nbe applied to study the high frequency conductivity of the surface states in\n(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 based three dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TI). In\nparticular, measuring the polarization dependence of the photogalvanic current\nand scanning with a micrometre sized beam spot across the sample, provides\naccess to (i) topographical inhomogeneity's in the electronic properties of the\nsurface states and (ii) the local domain orientation. An important advantage of\nthe proposed method is that it can be applied to study TIs at room temperature\nand even in materials with a high electron density of bulk carriers.\n", "  Yttrium Iron Garnet is the prototypical material used to study pure spin\ncurrents. It is a complex material with 20 magnetic atoms in the unit cell.\nAlmost all theories and experimental analysis approximates this complicated\nmaterial to a simple ferromagnet with a single spin wave mode. We use the\nmethod of atomistic spin dynamics to study the temperature evolution of the\nfull 20 mode exchange spin wave spectrum. Our results show a strong frequency\ndependence of the modes in quantitative agreement with neutron scattering\nexperiments. We find this causes in a reduction in the net spin pumping due to\nthe thermal occupation of optical modes with the opposite chirality to the FMR\nmode.\n", "  The odd-parity multipole is an emergent degree of freedom, leading to\nspontaneous inversion symmetry breaking. The odd-parity multipole order may\noccur by forming staggered even-parity multipoles in a unit cell. We focus on a\nlocally noncentrosymmetric bilayer Rashba system, and study an odd-parity\nelectric octupole order caused by the antiferro stacking of local electric\nquadrupoles. Analyzing the forward scattering model, we show that the electric\noctupole order is stabilized by a layer-dependent Rashba spin-orbit coupling.\nThe roles of the spin-orbit coupling are clarified on the basis of the analytic\nformula of multipole susceptibility. The spin texture allowed in the D_2d point\ngroup symmetry and its magnetic response are revealed. Furthermore, we show\nthat the parity-breaking quantum critical point appears in the magnetic field.\nThe possible realization of the electric octupole order in bilayer high-T_c\ncuprate superconductors is discussed.\n", "  In this work we develop a self-consistent approach for calculation of the\nPurcell factor and Lamb shift in highly dispersive hyperbolic metamaterial\naccounting for the effective dipole frequency shift. Also we theoretically\npredict the possibility of spontaneous topological transition, which occurs not\ndue to the external change of the system parameters but only due to the Lamb\nshift.\n", "  The combined effect of a lateral square superlattice potential and the\nCoulomb interaction on the ground state of a two-dimensional electron gas in a\nperpendicular magnetic field is studied for different rational values of\n$\\Gamma$, the inverse of the number of flux quanta per unit cell of the\nexternal potential, at filling factor $\\nu =1$ in Landau level $N=0.$ When\nLandau level mixing and disorder effects are neglected, increasing the strength\n$W_{0}$ of the potential induces a transition, at a critical strength\n$W_{0}^{\\left( c\\right) },$ from a uniform and fully spin polarized state to a\ntwo-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) with a meronlike spin texture at each\nmaximum and minimum of the CDW. The collective excitations of this vortex-CDW\nare similar to those of the Skyrme crystal that is expected to be the ground\nstate near filling factor $\\nu =1$. In particular, a broken U(1) symmetry in\nthe vortex-CDW results in an extra gapless phase mode that could provide a fast\nchannel for the relaxation of nuclear spins. The average spin polarization $%\nS_{z}$ changes in a continuous or discontinuous manner as $W_{0}$ is increased\ndepending on whether $\\Gamma \\in \\left[ 1/2,1\\right] $ or $\\Gamma \\in \\left[\n0,1/2\\right] .$ The phase mode and the meronlike spin texture disappear at\nlarge value of $W_{0},$ leaving as the ground state a partially spin-polarized\nCDW if $\\Gamma \\neq 1/2$ or a spin-unpolarized CDW if $\\Gamma =1/2.$\n", "  We describe the infinitesimal moduli space of pairs $(Y, V)$ where $Y$ is a\nmanifold with $G_2$ holonomy, and $V$ is a vector bundle on $Y$ with an\ninstanton connection. These structures arise in connection to the moduli space\nof heterotic string compactifications on compact and non-compact seven\ndimensional spaces, e.g. domain walls. Employing the canonical $G_2$ cohomology\ndeveloped by Reyes-Carri\\'on and Fern\\'andez and Ugarte, we show that the\nmoduli space decomposes into the sum of the bundle moduli\n$H^1_{\\check{d}_A}(Y,\\mathrm{End}(V))$ plus the moduli of the $G_2$ structure\npreserving the instanton condition. The latter piece is contained in\n$H^1_{\\check{d}_\\theta}(Y,TY)$, and is given by the kernel of a map\n${\\cal\\check F}$ which generalises the concept of the Atiyah map for\nholomorphic bundles on complex manifolds to the case at hand. In fact, the map\n${\\cal\\check F}$ is given in terms of the curvature of the bundle and maps\n$H^1_{\\check{d}_\\theta}(Y,TY)$ into $H^2_{\\check{d}_A}(Y,\\mathrm{End}(V))$, and\nmoreover can be used to define a cohomology on an extension bundle of $TY$ by\n$\\mathrm{End}(V)$. We comment further on the resemblance with the holomorphic\nAtiyah algebroid and connect the story to physics, in particular to heterotic\ncompactifications on $(Y,V)$ when $\\alpha'=0$.\n", "  The [CII] 158$\\mu$m emission line can arise in all phases of the ISM,\ntherefore being able to disentangle the different contributions is an important\nyet unresolved problem when undertaking galaxy-wide, integrated [CII]\nobservations. We present a new multi-phase 3D radiative transfer interface that\ncouples Starburst99, a stellar spectrophotometric code, with the\nphotoionisation and astrochemistry codes Mocassin and 3D-PDR. We model entire\nstar forming regions, including the ionised, atomic and molecular phases of the\nISM, and apply a Bayesian inference methodology to parametrise how the fraction\nof the [CII] emission originating from molecular regions, $f_{[CII],mol}$,\nvaries as a function of typical integrated properties of galaxies in the local\nUniverse. The main parameters responsible for the variations of $f_{[CII],mol}$\nare specific star formation rate (sSFR), gas phase metallicity, HII region\nelectron number density ($n_e$), and dust mass fraction. For example,\n$f_{[CII],mol}$ can increase from 60% to 80% when either $n_e$ increases from\n10$^{1.5}$ to 10$^{2.5}$cm$^{-3}$, or SSFR decreases from $10^{-9.6}$ to\n$10^{-10.6}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our model predicts for the Milky Way that\n$f_{[CII],mol}$$=75.8\\pm5.9$%, in agreement with the measured value of 75%.\nWhen applying the new prescription to a complete sample of galaxies from the\nHerschel Reference Survey (HRS), we find that anywhere from 60 to 80% of the\ntotal integrated [CII] emission arises from molecular regions.\n", "  We present the discovery of a hot-Jupiter transiting the V=9.23 mag\nmain-sequence A-star KELT-17 (BD+14 1881). KELT-17b is a 1.31 -0.29/+0.28 Mj,\n1.525 -0.060/+0.065 Rj hot-Jupiter in a 3.08 day period orbit misaligned at\n-115.9 +/- 4.1 deg to the rotation axis of the star. The planet is confirmed\nvia both the detection of the radial velocity orbit, and the Doppler\ntomographic detection of the shadow of the planet over two transits. The nature\nof the spin-orbit misaligned transit geometry allows us to place a constraint\non the level of differential rotation in the host star; we find that KELT-17 is\nconsistent with both rigid-body rotation and solar differential rotation rates\n(alpha < 0.30 at 2 sigma significance). KELT-17 is only the fourth A-star with\na confirmed transiting planet, and with a mass of 1.635 -0.061/+0.066 Msun,\neffective temperature of 7454 +/- 49 K, and projected rotational velocity v sin\nI_* = 44.2 -1.3/+1.5 km/s; it is amongst the most massive, hottest, and most\nrapidly rotating of known planet hosts.\n", "  The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Objects Survey (MANOS) aims to physically\ncharacterize sub-km Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). We report first photometric\nresults from the survey which began in August, 2013. Photometric observations\nwere performed using 1 m to 4 m class telescopes around the world. We present\nrotational periods and lightcurve amplitudes for 86 sub-km NEOs, though in some\ncases, only lower limits are provided. Our main goal is to obtain lightcurves\nfor small NEOs (typically, sub-km objects) and estimate their rotational\nperiods, lightcurve amplitudes, and shapes. These properties are used for\nstatistical study to constrain overall properties of the NEO population. A weak\ncorrelation seems to indicate that smaller objects are more spherical than the\nlarger ones. We also report 7 NEOs that are fully characterized (lightcurve and\nvisible spectra) as the most suitable candidates for a future human or robotic\nmission. Viable mission targets are objects fully characterized, with a\nDelta_v(NHATS) <12 km s^-1, and a rotational period P>1h. Assuming a similar\nrate of object characterization as reported in this paper, approximately 1,230\nNEOs need to be characterized in order to find 100 viable mission targets.\n", "  We report the existence of a universal trimer state induced by an impurity\ninteracting with a two-component spin-orbit coupled Fermi gas in two\ndimensions. In the zero-density limit with a vanishing Fermi sea, the trimer is\nstabilized by the symmetry of the single-particle spectrum under spin-orbit\ncoupling, and is therefore {\\it universal} against the short-range details of\nthe interaction potential. When the Fermi energy increases, we show that the\ntrimer is further stabilized by particle-hole fluctuations over a considerable\nparameter region. We map out the phase diagram consisting of trimers, dimers,\nand polarons, and discuss the detection of these states using radio-frequency\nspectroscopy. The universal trimer revealed in our work is a direct\nmanifestation of intriguing three-body correlations emerging from a many-body\nenvironment, which, in our case, is cooperatively supported by the\nsingle-particle spectral symmetry and the collective particle-hole excitations.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of formation and kinetics of hot OH\nmolecules in the upper atmosphere of Mars produced in reactions of thermal\nmolecular hydrogen and energetic oxygen atoms. Two major sources of energetic O\nconsidered are the photochemical production, via dissociative recombination of\nO$_{2}^{+}$ ions, and energizing collisions with fast atoms produced by the\nprecipitating Solar Wind (SW) ions, mostly H$^+$ and He$^{2+}$, and energetic\nneutral atoms (ENAs) originating in the charge-exchange collisions between the\nSW ions and atmospheric gases. Energizing collisions of O with atmospheric\nsecondary hot atoms, induced by precipitating SW ions and ENAs, are also\nincluded in our consideration. The non-thermal reaction O + H$_2(v,j)\n\\rightarrow$ H + OH$(v',j')$ is described using recent quantum-mechanical\nstate-to-state cross sections, which allow us to predict non-equilibrium\ndistributions of excited rotational and vibrational states $(v',j')$ of OH and\nexpected emission spectra. A fraction of produced translationally hot OH is\nsufficiently energetic to overcome Mars' gravitational potential and escape\ninto space, contributing to the hot corona. We estimate the total escape flux\nfrom dayside of Mars for low solar activity conditions at about\n$5\\times10^{22}$ s$^{-1}$, or about 0.1\\% of the total escape rate of atomic O\nand H. The described non-thermal OH production mechanism is general and\nexpected to contribute to the evolution of atmospheres of the planets,\nsatellites, and exoplanets with similar atmospheric compositions.\n", "  Collective coherent light scattering by polarizable particles creates\nsurprisingly strong, long range inter-particle forces originating from\ninterference of the light scattered by different particles. While for\nmonochromatic laser beams this interaction decays with the inverse distance, we\nshow here that in general the effective interaction range and geometry can be\ncontrolled by the illumination bandwidth and geometry. As generic example we\nstudy the modifications inter-particle forces within a 1D chain of atoms\ntrapped in the field of a confined optical nanofiber mode. For two particles we\nfind short range attraction as well as optical binding at multiple distances.\nThe range of stable distances shrinks with increasing light bandwidth and for a\nvery large bandwidth field as e.g. blackbody radiation we find a strongly\nattractive potential up to a critical distance beyond which the force gets\nrepulsive. Including multiple scattering can even lead to the appearance of a\nstable configuration at a large distance. Such broadband scattering forces\nshould be observable contributions in ultra-cold atom interferometers or atomic\nclocks setups. They could be studied in detail in 1D~geometries with ultra-cold\natoms trapped along or within an optical nanofiber. Broadband radiation force\ninteractions might also contribute in astrophysical scenarios as illuminated\ncold dust clouds.\n", "  We use a one-dimensional polariton fluid in a semiconductor microcavity to\nexplore the rich nonlinear dynamics of counter-propagating interacting Bose\nfluids. The intrinsically driven-dissipative nature of the polariton fluid\nallows to use resonant pumping to impose a phase twist across the fluid. When\nthe polariton-polariton interaction energy becomes comparable to their kinetic\nenergy, linear interference fringes transform into a train of solitons. A novel\ntype of bistable behavior controlled by the phase twist across the fluid is\nexperimentally evidenced.\n", "  We present the minimal realization of the $\\ell$-conformal Galilei group in\n2+1 dimensions on a single complex field. The simplest Lagrangians yield the\ncomplex Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator equations. We introduce a minimal deformation\nof the $\\ell$=1/2 conformal Galilei (a.k.a. Schr\\\"odinger) algebra and\nconstruct the corresponding invariant actions. Based on a new realization of\nthe d=1 conformal group, we find a massive extension of the near-horizon\nKerr-dS/AdS metric.\n", "  In the framework of the Standard Model effective field theory, we examine the\nindirect constraints on the trilinear Higgs coupling $\\lambda$ that arise from\nHiggs production in gluon-gluon-fusion and diphoton Higgs decays. We calculate\n2-loop contributions to the $gg \\to h$ and $h \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ amplitudes\nthat are affected by modifications of the trilinear Higgs-boson vertex. This\ncalculation involves both the computation of anomalous dimensions and finite\nmatching corrections. Based on our new results, we analyse the sensitivity of\npresent and future measurements of the $hgg$ and $h \\gamma \\gamma$ couplings to\nshifts in $\\lambda$. Under the assumption that $O_6 = - \\lambda \\left\n(H^\\dagger H \\right )^3$ is the only dimension-6 operator that alters the\ntrilinear Higgs interactions, we find that at present the considered loop-level\nprobes provide stronger constraints than $pp \\to 2h$. At future high-energy\ncolliders indirect ${\\cal O} (5)$ determinations of the trilinear Higgs\ncoupling may be possible, making precision measurements of $gg \\to h$ and $h\n\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ a useful addition to direct extractions of $\\lambda$ through\ndouble-Higgs production.\n", "  We consider two charged semipermeable membranes, which bound bulk electrolyte\nsolutions and are separated by a thin film of salt-free liquid. Small\ncounter-ions permeate into the gap, which leads to a steric charge separation\nin the system. To quantify the problem, we define an effective surface charge\ndensity of imaginary impermeable surface, which mimics an actual semipermeable\nmembrane and greatly simplify analysis. The effective charge depends on\nseparation, generally differ from the real one, and could even be of the\nopposite sign. From the exact and asymptotic solutions of the nonlinear\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation, we obtain the distribution of the potential and of\ncounter-ions in the system. We then derive explicit formulae for the disjoining\npressure in the gap and electro-osmotic velocity, and show that both are\ncontrolled by the effective surface charge.\n", "  We introduce an evolving network model in which a new node attaches to a\nrandomly selected target node and also to each of its neighbors with\nprobability $p$. The resulting network is sparse for $p<\\frac{1}{2}$ and dense\n(average degree increasing with number of nodes $N$) for $p\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$.\nIn the dense regime, individual networks realizations built by this copying\nmechanism are disparate and not self-averaging. Further, there is an infinite\nsequence of structural anomalies at $p=\\frac{2}{3}$, $\\frac{3}{4}$,\n$\\frac{4}{5}$, etc., where the dependences on $N$ of the number of triangles\n(3-cliques), 4-cliques, undergo phase transitions. When linking to second\nneighbors of the target can occur, the probability that the resulting graph is\ncomplete---where all nodes are connected---is non-zero as $N\\to\\infty$.\n", "  We report measurements of target- and double-spin asymmetries for the\nexclusive channel $\\vec e\\vec p\\to e\\pi^+ (n)$ in the nucleon resonance region\nat Jefferson Lab using the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS). These\nasymmetries were extracted from data obtained using a longitudinally polarized\nNH$_3$ target and a longitudinally polarized electron beam with energies 1.1,\n1.3, 2.0, 2.3 and 3.0 GeV. The new results are consistent with previous CLAS\npublications but are extended to a low $Q^2$ range from $0.0065$ to $0.35$\n(GeV$/c$)$^2$. The $Q^2$ access was made possible by a custom-built Cherenkov\ndetector that allowed the detection of electrons for scattering angles as low\nas $6^\\circ$. These results are compared with the unitary isobar models JANR\nand MAID, the partial-wave analysis prediction from SAID and the dynamic model\nDMT. In many kinematic regions our results, in particular results on the target\nasymmetry, help to constrain the polarization-dependent components of these\nmodels.\n", "  A remarkable property of intrinsic graphene is that upon doping, electrons\nand holes travel through the monolayer thick material with constant velocity\nwhich does not depend on energy up to about $0.3$ eV (Dirac fermions), as\nthough the electrons and holes are massless particles and antiparticles which\nmove at the Fermi velocity $v_F$. Consequently, there is Klein tunneling at a\n$p-n$ junction, in which there is no backscattering at normal incidence of\nmassless Dirac fermions. However, this process yielding perfect transmission at\nnormal incidence is expected to be affected when the group velocity of the\ncharge carriers is energy dependent and there is non-zero effective mass for\nthe target particle. We investigate how away from normal incidence the combined\neffect of incident electron energy $\\epsilon$ and band gap parameter $\\Delta$\ncan determine whether a $p-n$ junction would allow focusing of an electron beam\nby behaving like a Veselago lens with negative refractive index. We demonstrate\nthat there is a specific region in $\\epsilon-\\Delta$ space where the index of\nrefraction is negative, i.e., where monolayer graphene behaves as a\nmetamaterial. Outside this region, the refractive index may be positive or\nthere may be no refraction at all. We compute the ballistic conductance across\na $p-n$ junction as a function of $\\Delta$ and $\\epsilon$ and compare our\nresults with those for a single electrostatic potential barrier and multiple\nbarriers.\n", "  A galaxy group catalog is constructed from the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS)\nwith the use of a halo-based group finder. The halo mass associated with a\ngroup is estimated using a `GAP' method based on the luminosity of the central\ngalaxy and its gap with other member galaxies. Tests using mock samples shows\nthat this method is reliable, particularly for poor systems containing only a\nfew members. On average 80% of all the groups have completeness >0.8, and about\n65% of the groups have zero contamination. Halo masses are estimated with a\ntypical uncertainty $\\sim 0.35\\,{\\rm dex}$. The application of the group finder\nto the 2MRS gives 29,904 groups from a total of 43,246 galaxies at $z \\leq\n0.08$, with 5,286 groups having two or more members. Some basic properties of\nthis group catalog is presented, and comparisons are made with other groups\ncatalogs in overlap regions. With a depth to $z\\sim 0.08$ and uniformly\ncovering about 91% of the whole sky, this group catalog provides a useful data\nbase to study galaxies in the local cosmic web, and to reconstruct the mass\ndistribution in the local Universe.\n", "  We show how to implement topological or Thouless pumping of interacting\nphotons in one dimensional nonlinear resonator arrays, by simply modulating the\nfrequency of the resonators periodically in space and time. The interplay\nbetween interactions and the adiabatic modulations enables robust transport of\nFock states with few photons per site. We analyze the transport mechanism via\nan effective analytic model and study its topological properties and its\nprotection to noise. We conclude by a detailed study of an implementation with\nexisting circuit QED architectures.\n", "  In this paper we study the direct production of the diphoton resonance $X$\nwhich has been suggested by 2015 data at the LHC, in $e^+e^-\\to X\\gamma/XZ$\nprocesses at the ILC. We derive an analytic expression for the scattering\namplitudes of these processes, and present a comprehensive analysis for\ndetermining the properties of $X$ at the ILC. A realistic simulation study for\n$e^+e^-\\to X\\gamma$ is performed based on the full detector simulation to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of the ILC experiment. Complementary to the\nsearches at the LHC, prospects of the measurement of the absolute values of\nproduction cross-section are obtained for the ILC using recoil technique\nwithout assuming decay modes of $X$. In addition, we have studied the searches\nfor $X\\to\\rm{invisible}$ and $X\\to b\\bar{b}$ modes, which are challenging at\nthe LHC, and found that these decay modes can be discovered with high\nsignificance if their branching ratios are large enough.\n", "  We calculate some tree level scattering amplitudes for a generalization of\nthe protostring, which is a novel string model implied by the simplest string\nbit models. These bit models produce a lightcone worldsheet which supports $s$\ninteger moded Grassmann fields. In the generalization we supplement this\nGrassmann worldsheet system with $d=24-s$ transverse coordinate worldsheet\nfields. The protostring corresponds to $s=24$ and the bosonic string to $s=0$.\nThe interaction vertex is a simple overlap with no operator insertions at the\nbreak/join point. Assuming that $s$ is even we calculate the multi-string\nscattering amplitudes by bosonizing the Grassmann fields, each pair equivalent\nto one compactified bosonic field, and applying Mandelstam's interacting string\nformalism to a system of $s/2$ compactified and $d$ uncompactified bosonic\nworldsheet fields. We obtain all amplitudes for open strings with no oscillator\nexcitations and for closed strings with no oscillator excitations and zero\nwinding number. We then study in detail some simple special cases. Multi-string\nprocesses with maximal helicity violation have much simplified amplitudes. We\nalso specialize to general four string amplitudes and discuss their high energy\nbehavior. Most of these models are not covariant under the full Lorentz group\n$O(d+1,1)$. The exceptions are the bosonic string whose Lorentz group is\n$O(25,1)$ and the protostring whose Lorentz group is $O(1,1)$. The models in\nbetween only enjoy an $O(1,1)\\times O(d)$ spacetime symmetry.\n", "  A density-dependent effective potential for the baryon-baryon interaction in\nthe presence of the (hyper)nuclear medium is constructed, based on the leading\n(irreducible) three-baryon forces derived within SU(3) chiral effective field\ntheory. We evaluate the contributions from three classes: contact terms,\none-pion exchange and two-pion exchange. In the strangeness-zero sector we\nrecover the known result for the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction.\nExplicit expressions for the Lambda-nucleon in-medium potential in (asymmetric)\nnuclear matter are presented. Our results are suitable for implementation into\ncalculations of (hyper)nuclear matter. In order to estimate the low-energy\nconstants of the leading three-baryon forces we introduce the decuplet baryons\nas explicit degrees of freedom and construct the relevant terms in the minimal\nnon-relativistic Lagrangian. With these, the constants are estimated through\ndecuplet saturation. Utilizing this approximation we provide numerical results\nfor the effect of the three-body force in symmetric nuclear matter and pure\nneutron matter on the Lambda-nucleon interaction. A moderate repulsion that\nincreases with density is found in comparison to the free Lambda-nucleon\ninteraction.\n", "  We study the slow time evolution of localized states of the open-boundary\nLieb lattice when a magnetic flux is applied perpendicularly to the lattice and\nincreased linearly in time. In this system, Dirac cones periodically disappear,\nreappear and touch the flat band as the flux increases. We show that the slow\ntime evolution of a localized state in this system is analogous to that of a\nzero-energy state in a three-level system whose energy levels intersect\nperiodically and that this evolution can be mapped into a classical precession\nmotion with a precession axis that rotates as times evolves. Beginning with a\nlocalized state of the Lieb lattice, as the magnetic flux is increased linearly\nand slowly, the evolving state precesses around a state with a small itinerant\ncomponent and the amplitude of its localized component oscillates around a\nconstant value (below but close to 1), except at multiples of the flux quantum\nwhere it may vary sharply. This behavior reflects the existence of an electric\nfield (generated by the time-dependent magnetic field) which breaks the C4\nsymmetry of the constant flux Hamiltonian.\n", "  The effect of strain in zigzag ribbons of monolayer transition-metal\ndichalcogenides with induced superconductivity is studied using a minimal\n3-band tight-binding model. The unstrained system shows a topological phase\nwith Majorana zero modes localized at the boundaries of the one-dimensional\n(1D) zigzag edges. By direct inspection of the spectrum and wave functions we\nexamine the evolution of the topological phase as an in-plane, uniaxial\ndeformation is imposed. It is found that strain shifts the energy of 1D edge\nstates, thus causing a topological phase transition which eliminates the\nMajorana modes. For realistic parameter values, we show that the effect of\nstrain can be changed from completely destructive -- in which case a small\nbuilt in strain is enough to destroy the topological phase -- to a situation\nwhere strain becomes an effective tuning parameter which can be used to\nmanipulate Majorana zero modes. These two regimes are accessible by increasing\nthe value of the applied Zeeman field within realistic values. We also study\nhow strain effects are affected by the chemical potential, showing in\nparticular how unwanted effects can be minimized. Finally, as a cross-check of\nthe obtained results, we reveal the connection between 1D Majorana zero modes\nin the zigzag edge and the multi-band Berry phase, which serves as a\ntopological invariant of this system.\n", "  With the aim of paving the road for future accurate astrometry with MICADO at\nthe European-ELT, we performed an astrometric study using two different but\ncomplementary approaches to investigate two critical components that contribute\nto the total astrometric accuracy. First, we tested the predicted improvement\nin the astrometric measurements with the use of an atmospheric dispersion\ncorrector (ADC) by simulating realistic images of a crowded Galactic globular\ncluster. We found that the positional measurement accuracy should be improved\nby up to ~2 mas with the ADC, making this component fundamental for\nhigh-precision astrometry. Second, we analysed observations of a globular\ncluster taken with the only currently available Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics\nassisted camera, GeMS/GSAOI at Gemini South. Making use of previously measured\nproper motions of stars in the field of view, we were able to model the\ndistortions affecting the stellar positions. We found that they can be as large\nas ~200 mas, and that our best model corrects them to an accuracy of ~1 mas. We\nconclude that future astrometric studies with MICADO requires both an ADC and\nan accurate modelling of distortions to the field of view, either through an\na-priori calibration or an a-posteriori correction.\n", "  We review the state-of-the-art of Glauber-inspired models for estimating the\ndistribution of the number of participating nucleons in pA and AA collisions.\nWe argue that there is room for improvement in these models when it comes to\nthe treatment of diffractive excitation processes, and present a new simple\nGlauber-like model where these processes are better taken into account. We also\nsuggest a new way of using the number of participating, or wounded, nucleons to\nextrapolate event characteristics from pp collisions, and hence get an estimate\nof basic hadronic final-state properties in pA collisions, which may be used to\nextract possible nuclear effects. The new method is inspired by the Fritiof\nmodel, but based on the full, semi-hard multiparton interaction model of Pythia\n8.\n", "  In a general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM), the anomaly of muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment (muon g-2) can be explained by $\\mu-\\tau$ flavor violating\nYukawa couplings, motivated by the recent CMS excess in Higgs boson decay\n$h\\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$. We study Michel parameters for $\\tau$ decays $\\tau\n\\rightarrow l \\nu \\bar{\\nu}~(l=e,~\\mu)$ in the 2HDM with the lepton flavor\nviolation, and show that they can be sensitive to the flavor structure as well\nas the Lorentz and chiral structures of the model. We find that the correction\nto the Michel parameter $\\xi_\\mu$ in $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ is\ncorrelated to the contribution to the muon g-2, and it can be as large as\n$10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ in the parameter region where the $\\mu-\\tau$ flavor violating\nYukawa couplings explain the muon g-2 anomaly. Therefore the precision\nmeasurement of the Michel parameter at the level of $10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ would\nsignificantly probe the interesting parameter space for the solution to the\nmuon g-2 anomaly.\n", "  Several high priority subjects in astrophysics can be addressed by a\nstate-of-the-art soft x-ray grating spectrometer (XGS). An Explorer-scale,\nlarge-area (> 1,000 cm2), high resolving power (R > 3,000) XGS is highly\nfeasible based on Critical-Angle Transmission (CAT) gratings, even for\ntelescopes with angular resolution of 5-10 arcsec. Significantly higher\nperformance can be provided by a CAT XGS on an X-ray-Surveyor-type mission. CAT\ngratings combine the advantages of blazed reflection gratings (high efficiency,\nuse of higher diffraction orders) with those of transmission gratings (low\nmass, relaxed alignment and temperature requirements, transparent at high\nenergies) with minimal mission resource demands. They are high-efficiency\nblazed transmission gratings that consist of freestanding, ultra-high\naspect-ratio grating bars made from SOI wafers using anisotropic dry and wet\netch techniques. Blazing is achieved through reflection off grating bar\nsidewalls. Silicon is well matched to the soft x-ray band, and existing silicon\nCAT gratings exceed 30% absolute diffraction efficiency, with clear paths for\nimprovement. CAT gratings coated with heavier elements allow extension of the\nCAT grating principle to higher energies and larger angles, enabling higher\nresolving power at shorter wavelengths. We show x-ray data from CAT gratings\ncoated with platinum using atomic layer deposition, and demonstrate blazing to\nhigher energies and much larger blaze angles than possible with silicon. We\nmeasure resolving power of a CAT XGS consisting of a Wolter-I focusing mirror\npair from GSFC and CAT gratings, performed at the MSFC SLF. Measurement of the\nAl Ka doublet in 18th order shows resolving power > 10,000, based on\npreliminary analysis. This demonstrates that currently fabricated CAT gratings\nare compatible with the most advanced XGS designs for future soft x-ray\nspectroscopy missions.\n", "  We search for mirror and cavity-like features of a linear chain of atoms in\nwhich one of the atoms is specially chosen as a probe atom that is initially\nprepared in its excited state or is continuously driven by a laser field. Short\nchains are considered, composed of only three and five atoms. The analysis\ndemonstrate the importance of the inter atomic dipole-dipole interaction which\nmay lead to a collective ordering of the emission along some specific\ndirections. We examine the conditions under which the radiative modes available\nfor the emission are only those contained inside a cone centered about the\ninter atomic axis. Particular interest is in achieving the one-way emission\nalong the inter atomic axis, either into left (backward) or right (forward)\ndirection, which is referred to as a mirror-like behavior of the atomic chain.\nA direction dependent quantity called the directivity function, which\ndetermines how effective the system is in concentrating the radiation into a\ngiven direction, is introduced. We show that the function depends crucially on\nthe distance between the atoms and find that there is a threshold for the inter\natomic distances above which a strongly directional emission can be achieved.\nThe one-sided emission as a manifestation of the mirror-like behavior and a\nhighly focused emission along the inter atomic axis as a characteristic of a\nsingle-mode cavity are demonstrated to occur in the stationary field. Below the\nthreshold the directivity function is spherically symmetric. However, we find\nthat the population can be trapped in one of the atoms, and sometimes in all\natoms indicating that at these small distances the system decays to a state for\nwhich there are no radiative modes available for emission.\n", "  We develop a compact whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) sensing system by\nintegrating multiple components, including a tunable laser, a temperature\ncontroller, a function generator, an oscilloscope, a photodiode detector, and a\ntesting computer, into a phone-sized embedded system. We demonstrate a thermal\nsensing experiment by using this portable system. Such a system successfully\neliminates bulky measurement equipment required for characterizing optical\nresonators and will open up new avenues for practical sensing applications by\nusing ultra-high Q WGM resonators.\n", "  The rise of topological insulators in recent years has broken new ground both\nin the conceptual cognition of condensed matter physics and the promising\nrevolution of the electronic devices. It also stimulates the explorations of\nmore topological states of matter. Topological crystalline insulator is a new\ntopological phase, which combines the electronic topology and crystal symmetry\ntogether. In this article, we review the recent progress in the studies of\nSnTe-class topological crystalline insulator materials. Starting from the\ntopological identifications in the aspects of the bulk topology, surface states\ncalculations and experimental observations, we present the electronic\nproperties of topological crystalline insulators under various perturbations,\nincluding native defect, chemical doping, strain, and thickness-dependent\nconfinement effects, and then discuss their unique quantum transport\nproperties, such as valley-selective filtering and helicity-resolved\nfunctionalities for Dirac fermions. The rich properties and high tunability\nmake SnTe-class materials promising candidates for novel quantum devices.\n", "  This paper is a simulation based investigation of the effect of elastic\ncollisions and effectively elastic-like excitation collisions between electrons\nand background neutrals on the dynamics of a cylindrically trapped electron\ncloud that also has an ion contaminant mixed in it. Effects of the collisions\non the instability are evident from alteration in the growth rate and\nenergetics of the ion resonance instability caused by the presence of\nbackground neutrals as compared to a vacuum background. Further in order to\nunderstand if the non-ionizing collisions can independently be a cause of\ndestabilization of an electron cloud, a second set of numerical experiments\nwere performed with pure electron plasmas making non-ionizing collisions with\ndifferent densities of background neutrals. These experiments reveal that the\nnature of potential energy extraction from the electron cloud by the\nnon-ionizing collisions is not similar to the potential energy extraction of\nother destabilizing processes \\textit{e.g.} a resistive wall instability. This\ndifference in the energy extraction process renders these non-ionizing\ncollisions incapable of independently triggering an instability of the cloud.\n", "  Topological Lifshitz phase transition characterizes an abrupt change of the\ntopology of the Fermi surface through a continuous deformation of parameters.\nRecently, Lifshitz transition has been predicted to separate two types of Weyl\npoints: type-I and type-II (or called structured Weyl points), which has\nattracted considerable attention in various fields. Although recent\nexperimental investigation has seen a rapid progress on type-II Weyl points, it\nstill remains a significant challenge to observe their characteristic Lifshitz\ntransition. Here, we propose a scheme to realize both type-I and type-II Weyl\npoints in three-dimensional ultracold atomic gases by introducing an\nexperimentally feasible configuration based on current spin-orbit coupling\ntechnology. In the resultant Hamiltonian, we find three degenerate points: two\nWeyl points carrying a Chern number $-1$ and a four-fold degenerate point\ncarrying a Chern number $2$. Remarkably, by continuous tuning of a convenient\nexperimental knob, all these degenerate points can transition from type-I to\ntype-II, thereby providing an ideal platform to study different types of Weyl\npoints and directly probe their Lifshitz phase transition.\n", "  The Electron-Muon Ranger (EMR) is a fully-active tracking-calorimeter\ninstalled in the beam line of the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).\nThe experiment will demonstrate ionization cooling, an essential technology\nneeded for the realization of a Neutrino Factory and/or a Muon Collider. The\nEMR is designed to measure the properties of low energy beams composed of\nmuons, electrons and pions, and perform the identification\nparticle-by-particle. The detector consists of 48 orthogonal layers of 59\ntriangular scintillator bars. The readout is implemented using FPGA custom made\nelectronics and commercially available modules. This article describes the\nconstruction of the detector from its design up to its commissioning with\ncosmic data.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate the design of an all-optical\nnoiseless magnification and sampling function free from any active gain medium\nand associated high-power continuous wave pump source. The proposed technique\nis based on the co-propagation of an arbitrary shaped signal together with an\northogonally polarized intense fast sinusoidal beating within a normally\ndispersive optical fiber. Basically, the strong nonlinear phase shift induced\nby the sinusoidal pump beam on the orthogonal weak signal through cross-phase\nmodulation turns the defocusing regime into localized temporal focusing\neffects. This periodic focusing is then responsible for the generation of a\nhigh-repetition-rate temporal comb upon the incident signal whose amplitude is\ndirectly proportional to its initial shape. This internal redistribution of\nenergy leads to a simultaneous sampling and magnification of the signal\nintensity profile. This process allows us to experimentally demonstrate a\n40-GHz sampling operation as well as an 8-dB magnification of an arbitrary\nshaped nanosecond signal around 1550 nm in a 5-km long normally dispersive\nfiber. The experimental observations are in quantitative agreement with\nnumerical and theoretical analysis.\n", "  The exchange effect and the magneto-plasmon mode dispersion are studied\ntheoretically for an anisotropic two-dimensional electronic system in the\npresence of an uniform perpendicular magnetic field. Employing an effective\nlow-energy model with anisotropic effective masses, which is relevant for a\nmonolayer of phosphorus, the exchange effect due to the electron-electron\ninteraction is treated within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation.\nThe magneto-plasmon mode dispersion is obtained by solving a Bethe-Salpeter\nequation for the electron density-density correlation function within the\nladder diagram approximation. It is found that the exchange effect is reduced\nin the anisotropic system in comparison with the isotropic one. The\nmagneto-plasmon mode dispersion shows a clear dependence on the direction of\nthe wave vector.\n", "  We report on the design of a cryogenic setup for trapped ion quantum\ncomputing containing a segmented surface electrode trap. The heat shield of our\ncryostat is designed to attenuate alternating magnetic field noise, resulting\nin 120~dB reduction of 50~Hz noise along the magnetic field axis. We combine\nthis efficient magnetic shielding with high optical access required for single\nion addressing as well as for efficient state detection by placing two lenses\neach with numerical aperture 0.23 inside the inner heat shield. The cryostat\ndesign incorporates vibration isolation to avoid decoherence of optical qubits\ndue to the motion of the cryostat. We measure vibrations of the cryostat of\nless than $\\pm$20~nm over 2~s. In addition to the cryogenic apparatus, we\ndescribe the setup required for an operation with\n$^{\\mathrm{40}}$Ca$^{\\mathrm{+}}$ and $^{\\mathrm{88}}$Sr$^{\\mathrm{+}}$ ions.\nThe instability of the laser manipulating the optical qubits in\n$^{\\mathrm{40}}$Ca$^{\\mathrm{+}}$ is characterized yielding a minimum of its\nAllan deviation of 2.4$\\cdot$10$^{\\mathrm{-15}}$ at 0.33~s. To evaluate the\nperformance of the apparatus, we trapped $^{\\mathrm{40}}$Ca$^{\\mathrm{+}}$\nions, obtaining a heating rate of 2.14(16)~phonons/s and a Gaussian decay of\nthe Ramsey contrast with a 1/e-time of 18.2(8)~ms.\n", "  The advent of Wide Field Adaptive Optics (WFAO) systems marks the beginning\nof a new era in high spatial resolution imaging. The newly commissioned Gemini\nSouth Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS) combined with the infrared\ncamera Gemini South Adaptive Optics Imager (GSAOI), delivers quasi\ndiffraction-limited images over a field of 2 arc-minutes across. However,\ndespite this excellent performance, some variable residues still limit the\nquality of the analyses. In particular, distortions severely affect GSAOI and\nbecome a critical issue for high-precision astrometry and photometry. In this\npaper, we investigate an optimal way to correct for the distortion following an\ninverse problem approach. Formalism as well as applications on GeMS data are\npresented.\n", "  Transition from steady state to intermittent chaos in the cubical lid-driven\nflow is investigated numerically. Fully three-dimensional stability analyses\nhave revealed that the flow experiences an Andronov-Poincar\\'e-Hopf bifurcation\nat a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ = 1914. As for the 2D-periodic lid-driven\ncavity flows, the unstable mode originates from a centrifugal instability of\nthe primary vortex core. A Reynolds-Orr analysis reveals that the unstable\nperturbation relies on a combination of the lift-up and anti lift-up mechanisms\nto extract its energy from the base flow. Once linearly unstable, direct\nnumerical simulations show that the flow is driven toward a primary limit cycle\nbefore eventually exhibiting intermittent chaotic dynamics. Though only one\neigenpair of the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is unstable, the dynamics\nduring the intermittencies are surprisingly well characterized by one of the\nstable eigenpairs.\n", "  Sky-coverage in laser-assisted AO observations largely depends on the\nsystem's capability to guide on the faintest natural guide-stars possible. Here\nwe give an up-to-date status of our natural guide-star processing tailored to\nthe European-ELT's visible and near-infrared (0.47 to 2.45 {\\mu}m) integral\nfield spectrograph - Harmoni. We tour the processing of both the isoplanatic\nand anisoplanatic tilt modes using the spatio-angular approach whereby the\nwave-front is estimated directly in the pupil plane avoiding a cumbersome\nexplicit layered estimation on the 35-layer profiles we're currently using.\nTaking the case of Harmoni, we cover the choice of wave-front sensors, the\nnumber and field location of guide-stars, the optimised algorithms to beat down\nangular anisoplanatism and the performance obtained with different temporal\ncontrollers under split high-order/low-order tomography or joint tomography. We\nconsider both atmospheric and far greater telescope wind buffeting\ndisturbances. In addition we provide the sky-coverage estimates thus obtained.\n", "  By using integral forms we derive the superspace action of D=3, N=1\nsupergravity as an integral on a supermanifold. The construction is based on\ntarget space picture changing operators, here playing the role of Poincare'\nduals to the lower-dimensional spacetime surfaces embedded into the\nsupermanifold. We show how the group geometrical action based on the group\nmanifold approach interpolates between the superspace and the component\nsupergravity actions, thus providing another proof of their equivalence.\n", "  We address the issue of the proximity of interacting diffusion models on\nlarge graphs with a uniform degree property and a corresponding mean field\nmodel, i.e. a model on the complete graph with a suitably renormalized\ninteraction parameter. Examples include Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs with edge\nprobability $p_n$, $n$ is the number of vertices, such that $\\lim_{n \\to\n\\infty}p_n n= \\infty$. The purpose of this note it twofold: (1) to establish\nthis proximity on finite time horizon, by exploiting the fact that both systems\nare accurately described by a Fokker-Planck PDE (or, equivalently, by a\nnonlinear diffusion process) in the $n=\\infty$ limit; (2) to remark that in\nreality this result is unsatisfactory when it comes to applying it to systems\nwith $N$ large but finite, for example the values of $N$ that can be reached in\nsimulations or that correspond to the typical number of interacting units in a\nbiological system.\n", "  Ground state properties of spinless, extended Falicov-Kimball model (FKM) on\na finite size triangular lattice with orbital magnetic field normal to the\nlattice are studied using numerical diagonalization and Monte-Carlo simulation\nmethods. We show that the ground state configurations of localized electrons\nstrongly depend on the magnetic field. Magnetic field induces a metal to\ninsulator transition accompanied by segregated phase to an ordered regular\nphase except at density $n_f = 1/2$ of localized electrons. It is proposed that\nmagnetic field can be used as a new tool to produce segregated phase which was\notherwise accessible only either with correlated hopping or with large on-site\ninteractions.\n", "  We present the results of the computation of the next-to-leading order QCD\ncorrections to the production cross section of a Higgs boson in association\nwith a top-antitop pair at the LHC, including the three relevant dimension-six\noperators ($O_{t \\varphi }, O_{\\varphi G}, O_{tG}$) of the standard model\neffective field theory. These operators also contribute to the production of\nHiggs bosons in loop-induced processes at the LHC, such as inclusive Higgs,\n$Hj$ and $HH$ production, and modify the Higgs decay branching ratios for which\nwe also provide predictions. We perform a detailed study of the cross sections\nand their uncertainties at the total as well as differential level and of the\nstructure of the effective field theory at NLO including renormalisation group\neffects. Finally, we show how the combination of information coming from\nmeasurements of these production processes will allow to constrain the three\noperators at the current and future LHC runs. Our results lead to a significant\nimprovement of the accuracy and precision of the deviations expected from\nhigher-dimensional operators in the SM in both the top-quark and the\nHiggs-boson sectors and provide a necessary ingredient for performing a global\nEFT fit to the LHC data at NLO accuracy.\n", "  Mutualistic relationships among the different species are ubiquitous in\nnature. To prevent mutualism from slipping into antagonism, a host often\ninvokes a \"carrot and stick\" approach towards symbionts with a stabilizing\neffect on their symbiosis. In open human societies, a mutualistic relationship\narises when a native insider population attracts outsiders with benevolent\nincentives in hope that the additional labor will improve the standard of all.\nA lingering question, however, is the extent to which insiders are willing to\ntolerate outsiders before mutualism slips into antagonism. To test the\nassertion by Karl Popper that unlimited tolerance leads to the demise of\ntolerance, we model a society under a growing incursion from the outside.\nGuided by their traditions of maintaining the social fabric and prizing\ntolerance, the insiders reduce their benevolence toward the growing\nsubpopulation of outsiders but do not invoke punishment. This reduction of\nbenevolence intensifies as less tolerant insiders (e.g., \"radicals\") openly\nrenounce benevolence. Although more tolerant insiders maintain some level of\nbenevolence, they may also tacitly support radicals out of fear for the future.\nIf radicals and their tacit supporters achieve a critical majority, herd\nbehavior ensues and the relation between the insider and outsider\nsubpopulations turns antagonistic. To control the risk of unwanted social\ndynamics, we map the parameter space within which the tolerance of insiders is\nin balance with the assimilation of outsiders, the tolerant insiders maintain a\nsustainable majority, and any reduction in benevolence occurs smoothly. We also\nidentify the circumstances that cause the relations between insiders and\noutsiders to collapse or that lead to the dominance of the outsiders.\n", "  We formulate and study computationally the low Mach number fluctuating\nhydrodynamic equations for electrolyte solutions. We are interested in studying\ntransport in mixtures of charged species at the mesoscale, down to scales below\nthe Debye length, where thermal fluctuations have a significant impact on the\ndynamics. Continuing our previous work on fluctuating hydrodynamics of\nmulticomponent mixtures of incompressible isothermal miscible liquids (A.\nDonev, et al., Physics of Fluids, 27, 3, 2015), we now include the effect of\ncharged species using a quasielectrostatic approximation. Localized charges\ncreate an electric field, which in turn provides additional forcing in the mass\nand momentum equations. Our low Mach number formulation eliminates sound waves\nfrom the fully compressible formulation and leads to a more computationally\nefficient quasi-incompressible formulation. We demonstrate our ability to model\nsaltwater (NaCl) solutions in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium settings. We\nshow that our algorithm is second-order in the deterministic setting, and for\nlength scales much greater than the Debye length gives results consistent with\nan electroneutral/ambipolar approximation. In the stochastic setting, our model\ncaptures the predicted dynamics of equilibrium and nonequilibrium fluctuations.\nWe also identify and model an instability that appears when diffusive mixing\noccurs in the presence of an applied electric field.\n", "  The double field theory monopole solution by Berman and Rudolph is shown to\nreproduce non-geometric backgrounds with non-vanishing Q- and R-flux upon an\nappropriate choice of physical and dual coordinates. The obtained backgrounds\ndepend non-trivially on dual coordinates and have only trivial monodromies.\nUpon smearing the solutions along the dual coordinates one reproduces the known\n$5^2_2$ solution for the Q-brane and co-dimension 1 solution for the R-brane.\nThe T-duality invariant magnetic charge is explicitly calculated for all these\nbackgrounds and is found to be equal to the magnetic charge of (unsmeared)\nNS5-brane.\n", "  Small inner working angle coronagraphs are essential to benefit from the full\npotential of large and future extremely large ground-based telescopes,\nespecially in the context of the detection and characterization of exoplanets.\nAmong existing solutions, the vortex coronagraph stands as one of the most\neffective and promising solutions. However, for focal-plane coronagraph, a\nsmall inner working angle comes necessarily at the cost of a high sensitivity\nto pointing errors. This is the reason why a pointing control system is\nimperative to stabilize the star on the vortex center against pointing drifts\ndue to mechanical flexures, that generally occur during observation due for\ninstance to temperature and/or gravity variations. We have therefore developed\na technique called QACITS (Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for\nTip-tilt Sensing), which is based on the analysis of the coronagraphic image\nshape to infer the amount of pointing error. It has been shown that the flux\ngradient in the image is directly related to the amount of tip-tilt affecting\nthe beam. The main advantage of this technique is that it does not require any\nadditional setup and can thus be easily implemented on all current facilities\nequipped with a vortex phase mask. In this paper, we focus on the\nimplementation of the QACITS sensor at Keck/NIRC2, where an L-band AGPM has\nbeen recently commissioned (June and October 2015), successfully validating the\nQACITS estimator in the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The algorithm has\nbeen designed to be easily handled by any user observing in vortex mode, which\nis available for science in shared risk mode since 2016B.\n", "  We explore the possibility that physics at the TeV scale possesses\napproximate $N = 2$ supersymmetry, which is reduced to the $N=1$ minimal\nsupersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) at the electroweak scale.\nThis doubling of supersymmetry modifies the Higgs sector of the theory, with\nconsequences for the masses, mixings and couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons,\nwhose phenomenological consequences we explore in this paper. The mass of the\nlightest neutral Higgs boson $h$ is independent of $\\tan \\beta$ at the tree\nlevel, and the decoupling limit is realized whatever the values of the heavy\nHiggs boson masses. Radiative corrections to the top quark and stop squarks\ndominate over those due to particles in $N=2$ gauge multiplets. We assume that\nthese radiative corrections fix $m_h \\simeq 125$ GeV, whatever the masses of\nthe other neutral Higgs bosons $H, A$, a scenario that we term the $h$2MSSM.\nSince the $H, A$ bosons decouple from the $W$ and $Z$ bosons in the $h$2MSSM at\ntree level, only the LHC constraints on $H, A$ and $H^\\pm$ couplings to\nfermions are applicable. These and the indirect constraints from LHC\nmeasurements of $h$ couplings are consistent with $m_A \\gtrsim 200$ GeV for\n$\\tan \\beta \\in (2, 8)$ in the $h$2MSSM.\n", "  We study the possibility of pressure-induced transitions from a normal\nsemiconductor to a topological insulator (TI) in bismuth tellurohalides using\ndensity functional theory and tight-binding method. In BiTeI this transition is\nrealized through the formation of an intermediate phase, a Weyl semimetal, that\nleads to modification of surface state dispersions. In the topologically\ntrivial phase, the surface states exhibit a Bychkov-Rashba type dispersion. The\nWeyl semimetal phase exists in a narrow pressure interval of 0.2 GPa. After the\nWeyl semimetal--TI transition occurs, the surface electronic structure is\ncharacterized by gapless states with linear dispersion. The peculiarities of\nthe surface states modification under pressure depend on the band-bending\neffect. We have also calculated the frequencies of Raman active modes for BiTeI\nin the proposed high-pressure crystal phases in order to compare them with\navailable experimental data. Unlike BiTeI, in BiTeBr and BiTeCl the topological\nphase transition does not occur. In BiTeBr, the crystal structure changes with\npressure but the phase remains a trivial one. However, the transition appears\nto be possible if the low-pressure crystal structure is retained. In BiTeCl\nunder pressure, the topological phase does not appear up to 18 GPa due to a\nrelatively large band gap width in this compound.\n", "  We report on the development and characterization of a compact,\nfull-waveguide bandwidth (WR-10) signal source for general-purpose testing of\nmm-wave components. The MMIC-based multichip module is designed for compactness\nand ease-of-use, especially in size-constrained test sets such as a wafer probe\nstation. It takes as input a cm-wave CW reference and provides a factor of\nthree frequency multiplication as well as amplification, output power\nadjustment, and in-situ output power monitoring. It utilizes a number of custom\nMMIC chips such as a Schottky-diode limiter and a broadband mm-wave detector,\nboth designed explicitly for this module, as well as custom millimeter-wave\nmultipliers and amplifiers reported in previous papers.\n", "  In the Standard Model, there is the single Higgs field, $\\phi$, which gives\nrise to constituent quark and lepton masses. The Yukawa coupling is a highly\ncomplex set of $3 \\times 3$ matrices, resulting in many textures of quark and\nlepton masses. In this talk, I present a model which transfers the complexity\nof the Yukawa coupling matrices to a family of Higgs fields, so that the Yukawa\ncoupling itself becomes a simple interaction. In the context of this Enriched\nStandard Model, we introduce a new $r$-symmetry in the extended $SU(2)_L \\times\nU(1)_Y \\times U(1)_R$ model and show how the $125 \\;GeV$ and $750 \\;GeV$\nresonances may be identified with $H$ and $H'$, the key members of the Higgs\nfamily, with $H$ being in every way identifed with the SM Higgs. There are\ninteresting consequences of their $2 \\gamma$ decay widths.\n", "  The spin magnetic dipole transitions and the neutron-proton spin-spin\ncorrelations in $sd-$shell even-even nuclei with $N=Z$ are investigated using\nshell model wave functions. The isoscalar spin-triplet pairing correlation\nprovides a substantial quenching effect on the spin magnetic dipole\ntransitions, especially the isovector (IV) ones. Consequently, an enhanced\nisoscalar spin-triplet pairing interaction influences the proton-neutron\nspin-spin correlation deduced from the difference between the isoscalar (IS)\nand the IV sum rule strengths. The effect of the $\\Delta$ ($\\Delta_{33}$\nresonance)-hole coupling is examined in the IV spin transition and the\nspin-spin correlations of the ground states.\n", "  The anomalous dimension of twist-2 operators of arbitrary spin in planar N=4\nSYM theory is found at seven loops by using the quantum spectral curve to\ncompute values at fixed spin, and reconstructing the general result using the\nLLL-algorithm together with modular arithmetic. The result of the analytic\ncontinuation to negative spin is presented, and its relation with the recently\ncomputed correction to the BFKL and double-logarithmic equation is discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we have extended the previous study of the thermodynamics and\nphase transition of the Schwarzschild black hole in the rainbow gravity to the\nSchwarzschild-AdS black hole where metric depends on the energy of a probe.\nMaking use of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the modified dispersion\nrelation, we have obtained the modified local Hawking temperature and\nthermodynamic quantities in an isothermal cavity. Moreover, we carry out the\nanalysis of constant temperature slices of a black hole. As a result, we have\nshown that there also exists another Hawking-Page-like phase transition in\nwhich case a locally stable small black hole tunnels into a globally stable\nlarge black hole as well as the standard Hawking-Page phase transition from a\nhot flat space to a black hole.\n", "  We consider analytically and numerically an anisotropic spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\ndelta-chain (sawtooth chain) in which exchange interactions between apical and\nbasal spins are ferromagnetic and those between basal spins are\nantiferromagnetic. In the limit of strong anisotropy of exchange interactions\nthis model can be considered as the Ising delta chain with macroscopic\ndegenerate ground state perturbed by transverse quantum fluctuations. These\nperturbations lift the ground state degeneracy and the model reduces to the\nbasal XXZ spin chain in the magnetic field induced by static apical spins. We\nshow that the ground state of such model is ferrimagnetic. The excitations of\nthe model are formed by ferrimagnetic domains separated by domain walls with a\nfinite energy. At low temperatures the system is effectively divided into two\nindependent subsystems, the apical subsystem described by the Ising\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ chain and the basal subsystem described by the XXZ chain\nwith infinite $zz$ interactions.\n", "  We evaluate a four-loop conformal integral, i.e. an integral over four\nfour-dimensional coordinates, by turning to its dimensionally regularized\nversion and applying differential equations for the set of the corresponding\n213 master integrals. To solve these linear differential equations we follow\nthe strategy suggested by Henn and switch to a uniformly transcendental basis\nof master integrals. We find a solution to these equations up to weight eight\nin terms of multiple polylogarithms. Further, we present an analytical result\nfor the given four-loop conformal integral considered in four-dimensional\nspace-time in terms of single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. As a by-product,\nwe obtain analytical results for all the other 212 master integrals within\ndimensional regularization, i.e. considered in D dimensions.\n", "  Significant effort has been expended in the search for materials with\nultra-fast nonlinear-optical susceptibilities, but most fall far below the\nfundamental limits. This work applies a theoretical materials development\nprogram that has identified a promising new hybrid made of a nanorod and a\nmolecule. This system uses the electrostatic dipole moment of the molecule to\nbreak the symmetry of the metallic nanostructure that shifts the energy\nspectrum to make it optimal for a nonlinear-optical response near the\nfundamental limit. The structural parameters are varied to determine the ideal\nconfiguration, providing guidelines for making the best structures.\n", "  One of the key science goals for extremely large telescopes (ELTs) is the\ndetailed characterization of already known directly imaged exoplanets. The\ntypical adaptive optics (AO) Nyquist control region for ELTs is ~0.4\narcseconds, placing many already known directly imaged planets outside the DM\ncontrol region and not allowing any standard wavefront control scheme to remove\nspeckles that would allow higher SNR images/spectra to be acquired. This can be\nfixed with super-Nyquist wavefront control (SNWFC), using a sine wave phase\nplate to allow for wavefront control outside the central DM Nyquist region. We\ndemonstrate that SNWFC is feasible through a simple, deterministic,\nnon-coronagraphic, super-Nyquist speckle nulling technique in the adaptive\noptics laboratory at the National Research Council of Canada. We also present\nresults in simulation of how SNWFC using the self coherent camera (SCC) can be\nused for high contrast imaging. This technique could be implemented on future\nhigh contrast imaging instruments to improve contrast outside the standard\ncentral dark hole for higher SNR characterization of exoplanets.\n", "  We investigate the electronic structure, dielectric and optical properties of\nbismuth tellurohalides BiTeX (X = I, Cl, Br) by means of all-electron density\nfunctional theory. In particular, we present the ab initio conductivities and\ndielectric tensors calculated over a wide frequency range, and compare our\nresults with the recent measurements by Akrap et al. , Makhnev et al. , and\nRusinov et al. . We show how the low-frequency branch of the optical\nconductivity can be used to identify characteristic intra- and interband\ntransitions between the Rashba spin-split bands in all three bismuth\ntellurohalides. We further calculate the refractive indices and dielectric\nconstants, which in turn are systematically compared to previous predictions\nand measurements. We expect that our quantitative analysis will contribute to\nthe general assessment of bulk Rashba materials for their potential use in\nspintronics devices.\n", "  We calculate the value of the coupling at the infrared zero of the beta\nfunction of an asymptotically free SU(3) gauge theory at the five-loop level as\na function of the number of fermions. Both a direct analysis of the beta\nfunction and analyses of Pad\\'e approximants are used for this purpose. We then\ncalculate the value of the five-loop anomalous dimension, $\\gamma_m$, of the\nfermion bilinear at this IR zero of the beta function.\n", "  ERIS is the new AO instrument for VLT-UT4 led by a Consortium of Max-Planck\nInstitut fuer Extraterrestrische Physik, UK-ATC, ETH-Zurich, ESO and INAF. The\nERIS AO system provides NGS mode to deliver high contrast correction and LGS\nmode to extend high Strehl performance to large sky coverage. The AO module\nincludes NGS and LGS wavefront sensors and, with VLT-AOF Deformable Secondary\nMirror and Laser Facility, will provide AO correction to the high resolution\nimager NIX (1-5um) and the IFU spectrograph SPIFFIER (1-2.5um). In this paper\nwe present the preliminary design of the ERIS AO system and the estimated\ncorrection performance.\n", "  We propose a new approach based on the path integral formalism to the\ncalculation of the probability distribution functions of quadratic quantities\nof the Gaussian polymer chain in d-dimensional space, such as the radius of\ngyration and potential energy in the parabolic well. In both cases we obtain\nthe exact relations for the characteristic function and cumulants. Using the\nstandard steepest-descent method, we evaluate the probability distribution\nfunctions in two limiting cases of the large and small values of corresponding\nvariables.\n", "  The lightest mass eigenvalue of a six-dimensional theory compactified on a\ntorus is numerically evaluated in the presence of the brane-localized mass\nterm. The dependence on the cutoff scale $\\Lambda$ is non-negligible even when\n$\\Lambda$ is two orders of magnitude above the compactification scale, which\nindicates that the mass eigenvalue is sensitive to the size of the brane, in\ncontrast to five-dimensional theories. We obtain an approximate expression of\nthe lightest mass in the thin brane limit, which well fits the numerical\ncalculations, and clarifies its dependence on the torus moduli parameter\n$\\tau$. We find that the lightest mass is typically much lighter than the\ncompactification scale by an order of magnitude even in the limit of a large\nbrane mass.\n", "  At the heart of today's solar magnetic field evolution models lies the alpha\ndynamo description. In this work, we investigate the fate of alpha-dynamos as\nthe magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ is increased. Using Floquet theory, we are\nable to precisely quantify mean field effects like the alpha and beta effect\n(i) by rigorously distinguishing dynamo modes that involve large scale\ncomponents from the ones that only involve small scales, and by (ii) providing\na way to investigate arbitrary large scale separations with minimal\ncomputational cost. We apply this framework to helical and non-helical flows as\nwell as to random flows with short correlation time. Our results determine that\nthe alpha-description is valid for $Rm$ smaller than a critical value $Rm_c$ at\nwhich small scale dynamo instability starts. When $Rm$ is above $Rm_c$ the\ndynamo ceases to follow the mean field description and the growth rate of the\nlarge scale modes becomes independent of the scale separation while the energy\nin the large scale modes is inversely proportional to the square of the scale\nseparation. The results in this second regime do not depend on the presence of\nhelicity. Thus alpha-type modeling for solar and stellar models needs to be\nreevaluated and new directions for mean field modeling are proposed.\n", "  The properties of some forms of water ice reserve still intriguing surprises.\nBesides the several stable or metastable phases of pure ice, solid mixtures of\nwater with gases are precursors of other ices, since in some cases they may be\nemptied, leaving a metastable hydrogen bound water structure. We present here\nthe first characterization of a new form of ice, obtained from the crystalline\nsolid compound of water and molecular hydrogen called C$_0$ filled ice. By\nmeans of Raman spectroscopy, we measure the hydrogen release at different\ntemperatures, and succeed in rapidly removing all the hydrogen molecules,\nobtaining a new form of ice (ice XVII). Its structure is determined by means of\nneutron diffraction measurements. Of paramount interest is that the emptied\ncrystal can adsorb again hydrogen and release it repeatedly, showing a\ntemperature dependent hysteresis.\n", "  We present the last version of the PyrAmid Simulator Software for Adaptive\nopTics Arcetri (PASSATA), an IDL and CUDA based object oriented software\ndeveloped in the Adaptive Optics group of the Arcetri observatory for\nMonte-Carlo end-to-end adaptive optics simulations. The original aim of this\nsoftware was to evaluate the performance of a single conjugate adaptive optics\nsystem for ground based telescope with a pyramid wavefront sensor. After some\nyears of development, the current version of PASSATA is able to simulate\nseveral adaptive optics systems: single conjugate, multi conjugate and ground\nlayer, with Shack Hartmann and Pyramid wavefront sensors. It can simulate from\n8m to 40m class telescopes, with diffraction limited and resolved sources at\nfinite or infinite distance from the pupil. The main advantages of this\nsoftware are the versatility given by the object oriented approach and the\nspeed given by the CUDA implementation of the most computational demanding\nroutines. We describe the software with its last developments and present some\nexamples of application.\n", "  We study the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ duality where the boundary CFT is free\nYang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). At the planar level we use the\nspectrum and correlation functions of the boundary theory to explicate features\nof the bulk theory. Further, by computing the one-loop partition function of\nthe bulk theory using the methods of arXiv:1603.05387, we argue that the bulk\ncoupling constant should be shifted to $N^2$ from $N^2-1$. Similar conclusions\nare reached by studying the dualities in thermal AdS$_5$ with $S^1\\times S^3$\nboundary.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion on neutrinoless double beta decay within a\nclass of left-right symmetric models where neutrino mass originates by natural\ntype-II seesaw dominance. The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars. The fermion sector is extended with\nan extra sterile neutrino per generation that helps in implementing the seesaw\nmechanism. The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I\nseesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$. The key\nfeature of this work is that all the physical masses and mixing are expressed\nin terms of neutrino oscillation parameters and lightest neutrino mass thereby\nfacilitating to constrain light neutrino masses from $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay.\nWith this large value of $M_D$ new contributions arise due to; i) purely\nleft-handed current via exchange of heavy right-handed neutrinos as well as\nsterile neutrinos, ii) the so called $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ diagrams. New physics\ncontributions also arise from right-handed currents with right-handed gauge\nboson $W_R$ mass around $3$~TeV. From the numerical study, we find that the new\ncontributions to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay not only saturate the current\nexperimental bound but also give lower limit on absolute scale of lightest\nneutrino mass and favor NH pattern of light neutrino mass hierarchy.\n", "  We present an alternative Corrector-ADC design for GMT. The design consists\nof just 3 silica lenses, of maximum size 1.51m, and includes only a single\nlow-precision asphere for 20' field-of-view, and none for 10'. The\npolychromatic (360nm-1300nm) image quality is d80<0.043\" at zenith and\nd80<0.20\" for ZD<60 degrees. The monochromatic image quality is d80<0.1\"\neverywhere, and typically ~0.05\". The ADC action is achieved by tilt and\ntranslation of all three lenses; L1 and L2 via simple slide mechanisms each\nusing a single encoded actuator, and L3 via a novel 'tracker-ball' support and\nthree actuators. There is also a small motion of M2 via the hexapod,\nautomatically generated by the AGWS system. The ADC action causes a small\nnon-telecentricity, but this is much less than the unavoidable chromatic\neffects shared with the baseline design. The ADC action also changes the\ndistortion pattern of the telescope, but this can be used positively, to reduce\nthe maximum image motion due to differential refraction by a factor of three.\nThe transmission is superb at all wavelengths, because of the reduced number of\nair/glass surfaces, and the use only of fused silica.\n", "  Memristive switching devices, candidates for resistive random access memory\ntechnology, have been shown to switch off through a progression of states with\nquantized conductance and subsequent non-integer conductance (in terms of\nconductance quantum $G_0$). We have performed calculations based on density\nfunctional theory to model the switching process for a Pt-HfO$_2$-Pt structure,\ninvolving the movement of one or two oxygen atoms. Oxygen atoms moving within a\nconductive oxygen vacancy filament act as tunneling barriers, and partition the\nfilament into weakly coupled quantum wells. We show that the low-bias\nconductance decreases exponentially when one oxygen atom moves away from\ninterface. Our results demonstrate the high sensitivity of the device\nconductance to the position of oxygen atoms.\n", "  We construct the gravity duals of the Higgs branches of three-dimensional\n(four-dimensional) super Yang-Mills theories coupled to $N_\\textrm{f}$ quark\nflavors. The effect of the quarks on the color degrees of freedom is included,\nand corresponds on the gravity side to the backreaction of $N_\\textrm{f}$\nflavor D6-branes (D7-branes) on the background of $N_\\textrm{c}$ color\nD2-branes (D3-branes). The Higgsing of the gauge group arises from the\ndissolution of some color branes inside the flavor branes. The dissolved color\nbranes are represented by non-Abelian instantons whose backreaction is also\nincluded. The result is a cascading-like solution in which the effective number\nof color branes varies along the holographic direction. In the\nthree-dimensional case the solution may include an arbitrary number of\nquasi-conformal (walking) regions.\n", "  Superconducting properties of three series of amorphous WxSi1-x films with\ndifferent thickness and stoichiometry were investigated by dc transport\nmeasurements in a magnetic field up to 9 T. These amorphous WxSi1-x films were\ndeposited by magnetron co-sputtering of the elemental source targets onto\nsilicon substrates at room temperature and patterned in form of bridges by\noptical lithography and reactive ion etching. Analysis of the data on\nmagnetoconductivity allowed us to extract the critical temperature,\nsuperconducting coherence length, magnetic penetration depth, and diffusion\ncoefficient of electrons in the normal state as a function of film thickness\nfor each stoichiometry. Two basic time constants were derived from transport\nand time-resolving measurements. A dynamic process of the formation of a\nhot-spot was analyzed in the framework of a diffusion-based vortex-entry model.\nWe used the two stage diffusion approach and defined a hotspot size by assuming\nthat the quasi-particles and normal-state electrons have the equal diffusion\nconstant. Our findings are consistent with the most recent results on a\nhot-spot relaxation time in the WxSi1-x superconducting nanowire single-photon\ndetector. In the 5 nm thick W0.85Si0.15 film the hot-spot has a diameter of 105\nnm at the peak of the number of non-equilibrium quasi-particles.\n", "  Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are introduced in its most general\nform, that is, completely arbitrary complex numbers. Here we show that their\norigin could not be general but dictated by a principle.\n", "  The coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole is a primary science\ntarget of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Constraining or measuring\nthe neutron star spin directly from gravitational wave observations requires\nknowledge of the dependence of the emission properties of these systems on the\nneutron star spin. This paper lays foundations for this task, by developing a\nnumerical method to construct initial data for black hole--neutron star\nbinaries with arbitrary spin on the neutron star. We demonstrate the robustness\nof the code by constructing initial-data sets in large regions of the parameter\nspace. In addition to varying the neutron star spin-magnitude and\nspin-direction, we also explore neutron star compactness, mass-ratio, black\nhole spin, and black hole spin-direction. Specifically, we are able to\nconstruct initial data sets with neutron stars spinning near centrifugal\nbreak-up, and with black hole spins as large as $S_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\rm BH}^2=0.99$.\n", "  We investigate QCD amplitudes with massive quarks computed in the\nfour-dimensional helicity scheme (FDH) and dimensional reduction at NNLO and\ndescribe how they are related to the corresponding amplitudes computed in\nconventional dimensional regularization. To this end, the scheme dependence of\nthe heavy quark and the velocity-dependent cusp anomalous dimensions is\ndetermined using soft-collinear effective theory. The results are checked\nagainst explicit computations of massive form factors in FDH at NNLO. Our\nresults complete the description of the scheme dependence of QCD amplitudes at\nNNLO.\n", "  We study diffusion-controlled single-species annihilation with sparse initial\nconditions. In this random process, particles undergo Brownian motion, and when\ntwo particles meet, both disappear. We focus on sparse initial conditions where\nparticles occupy a subspace of dimension $\\delta$ that is embedded in a larger\nspace of dimension $d$. We find that the co-dimension $\\Delta=d-\\delta$ governs\nthe behavior. All particles disappear when the co-dimension is sufficiently\nsmall, $\\Delta\\leq 2$; otherwise, a finite fraction of particles indefinitely\nsurvive. We establish the asymptotic behavior of the probability $S(t)$ that a\ntest particle survives until time $t$. When the subspace is a line, $\\delta=1$,\nwe find inverse logarithmic decay, $S\\sim (\\ln t)^{-1}$, in three dimensions,\nand a modified power-law decay, $S\\sim (\\ln t)\\,t^{-1/2}$, in two dimensions.\nIn general, the survival probability decays algebraically when $\\Delta <2$, and\nthere is an inverse logarithmic decay at the critical co-dimension $\\Delta=2$.\n", "  Group-IV-based ferromagnetic semiconductor Ge1-xFex (GeFe) is one of the most\npromising materials for efficient spin injectors and detectors for Si and Ge.\nRecent first principles calculations (Sakamoto et al., Ref. 9) suggested that\nthe Fermi level is located in two overlapping largely spin-polarized bands\nformed in the bandgap of GeFe; spin-down d(e) band and spin-up p-d(t2) band.\nThus, it is important to clarify how these bands contribute to spin injection\nand detection. In this study, we show the first successful observation of the\ntunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)\ncontaining a group-IV ferromagnetic semiconductor, that is, in MTJs composed of\nepitaxially grown Fe/MgO/Ge0.935Fe0.065. We find that the p-d(t2) band in GeFe\nis mainly responsible for the tunneling transport. Although the obtained TMR\nratio is small (0.3%), the TMR ratio is expected to be enhanced by suppressing\nleak current through amorphous-like crystal domains observed in MgO.\n", "  Microscopic stress fields are widely used in molecular simulations to\nunderstand mechanical behavior. Recently, decomposition methods of multibody\nforces to central force pairs between the interacting particles have been\nproposed. Here, we introduce a force center of a three-body potential and\npropose different force decompositions that also satisfy the conservation of\ntranslational and angular momentum. We compare the force decompositions by\nstress-distribution magnitude and discuss their difference in the stress\nprofile of a bilayer membrane using coarse-grained and atomistic molecular\ndynamics simulations.\n", "  Direct CP violation in charmless three-body hadronic decays of $B$ mesons is\nstudied within the framework of a simple model based on the factorization\napproach. Three-body decays of heavy mesons receive both resonant and\nnonresonant contributions. Dominant nonresonant contributions to tree-dominated\nand penguin-dominated three-body decays arise from the $b\\to u$ tree transition\nand $b\\to s$ penguin transition, respectively. The former can be evaluated in\nthe framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory with some modification,\nwhile the latter is governed by the matrix element of the scalar density\n$\\langle M_1M_2|\\bar q_1 q_2|0\\rangle$. Strong phases in this work reside in\neffective Wilson coefficients, propagators of resonances and the matrix element\nof scalar density. In order to accommodate the branching fraction and CP\nasymmetries observed in $B^-\\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$, the matrix element $\\langle\nK\\pi|\\bar sq|0\\rangle$ should have an additional strong phase, which might\narise from some sort of power corrections such as final-state interactions. We\ncalculate inclusive and regional CP asymmetries and find that nonresonant CP\nviolation is usually much larger than the resonant one and that the\ninterference effect is generally quite significant. If nonresonant\ncontributions are turned off in the $K^+K^-K^-$ mode, the predicted CP\nasymmetries due to resonances will be wrong in sign when confronted with\nexperiment. In our study of $B^-\\to \\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$, we find that ${\\cal\nA}_{C\\!P}(\\rho^0\\pi^-)$ should be positive in order to account for CP\nasymmetries observed in this decay. However, all theories predict a large and\nnegative CP violation in $B^-\\to \\rho^0\\pi^-$. Measurements of CP-asymmetry\nDalitz distributions put very stringent constraints on the theoretical models.\nWe check the magnitude and the sign of violation in some (large) invariant mass\nregions to test our model.\n", "  We study N = 2* theories with gauge group U(N) and use equivariant\nlocalization to calculate the quantum expectation values of the simplest chiral\nring elements. These are expressed as an expansion in the mass of the adjoint\nhypermultiplet, with coefficients given by quasi-modular forms of the S-duality\ngroup. Under the action of this group, we construct combinations of chiral ring\nelements that transform as modular forms of definite weight. As an independent\ncheck, we confirm these results by comparing the spectral curves of the\nassociated Hitchin system and the elliptic Calogero-Moser system. We also\npropose an exact and compact expression for the 1-instanton contribution to the\nexpectation value of the chiral ring elements.\n", "  This short note is devoted to the canonical analysis of the Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity with mixed derivative terms that was proposed in arXiv:1604.04215. We\ndetermine the algebra of constraints and we show that there is one additional\nscalar degree of freedom with respect to the non-projectable Horava-Lifshitz\ngravity.\n", "  We present a method for the calculation of photoemission spectra in terms of\nreduced density matrices. We start from the spectral representation of the\none-body Green's function G, whose imaginary part is related to photoemission\nspectra, and we introduce a frequency-dependent effective energy that accounts\nfor all the poles of G. Simple approximations to this effective energy give\naccurate spectra in model systems in the weak as well as strong correlation\nregime. In real systems reduced density matrices can be obtained from reduced\ndensity-matrix functional theory. Here we use this approach to calculate the\nphotoemission spectrum of bulk NiO: our method yields a qualitatively correct\npicture both in the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, contrary to\nmean-field methods, in which the paramagnet is a metal.\n", "  We have carried out a study of the momentum distribution and of the spectrum\nof elementary excitations of liquid $^4$He across the normal-superfluid\ntransition temperature, using the path integral Monte Carlo method. Our results\nfor the momentum distribution in the superfluid regime show that a kink is\npresent in the range of momenta corresponding to the roton excitation. This\neffect disappears when crossing the transition temperature to the normal fluid,\nin a behavior currently unexplained by theory.\n", "  In this paper we develop the frame-like gauge invariant formulation for the\nmassive two-column bosonic fields in (anti) de Sitter space-times. We begin\nwith the partially massless cases in AdS and dS and then we combine these\nresults into the general massive theory. Separate section is devoted to the\nspecial case where both columns have equal number of indices.\n", "  We present a detailed study of charged-current (CC) neutrino-nucleus\nreactions in a fully relativis- tic framework and comparisons with recent\nexperiments spanning an energy range from hundreds of MeV up to 100 GeV within\nthe SuperScaling Approach, which is based on the analysis of electron- nucleus\nscattering data and has been recently improved with the inclusion of\nRelativistic Mean Field theory effects. We also evaluate and discuss the impact\nof two-particle two-hole meson-exchange currents (2p-2h MEC) on\nneutrino-nucleus interactions through the analysis of two-particle two-hole\naxial and vector contributions to weak response functions in a fully\nrelativistic Fermi gas. The results show a fairly good agreement with\nexperimental data over the whole range of neutrino energies.\n", "  Millisecond focal plane telemetry is now becoming practical due to a new\ngeneration of near-IR detector arrays with sub-electron noise that are capable\nof kHz readout rates. Combining these data with those simultaneously available\nfrom the wavefront sensing system allows the possibility of self-consistently\ndetermining the optical aberrations (the cause of quasi-static speckles) and\nthe planetary image. This approach may be especially advantageous for finding\nplanets within about 3 $\\lambda / D$ of the star where differential imaging is\nineffective. As shown in a recent article by the author (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A.,\n33, 712, 2016), one must account for unknown aberrations in several\nnon-conjugate planes of the optical system, which, in turn, requires ability to\ncomputational propagate the field between these planes. These computations are\nlikely to be difficult to implement and expensive. Here, a far more convenient\nalternative based on empirical Green's functions is provided. It is shown that\nthe empirical Green's function (EGF), which accounts for all multi-planar,\nnon-common path aberrations, and results in a much more tractable and highly\nparallel computational problem. It is also shown that the EGF can be\ngeneralized to treat polarization, resulting in the empirical Green's tensor\n(EGT).\n", "  The equivalence between the Non-Abelian Nambu model (NANM) and Yang Mills\ntheory is proved, after demanding the Gauss laws at some initial time to the\nfirst one. Thereby, the Lorentz violation encoded into the constraint that\ndefines the NANM is physically unobservable. As result, the Goldstone bosons in\nthe NANM arising from the spontaneous symmetry breaking can be identified as\nthe standard gauge fields.\n", "  In this letter we show a general description about flavor-changing neutral\ncurrents (FCNC) mediated by scalars. The analysis is extended at two-loop level\nfor the Two-Higgs Doublet Model type-III because others models have strong\nconstraints on its parameters, even at high orders of the perturbation. For\nthis letter we focus on the standard model, calculating the amplitude for the\n$h \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ process and discussing the results briefly.\n", "  We present an analysis of the optical response of a class of on-chip\nintegrated nano-photonic systems comprising all-dielectric building block based\nmultifunctional light manipulating units (LMU) integrated with quantum dot (QD)\nlight sources. The multiple functions (such as focusing excitation light, QD\nemission rate enhancement, photon guidance, and lossless propagation) are\nsimultaneously realized using the collective Mie resonances of dipole and\nhigher order multipole modes of the dielectric building blocks (DBBs)\nconstituting a single structural unit, the LMU. Using analytical formulation\nbased on Mie theory we demonstrate enhancement of the excitation light\nsimultaneously with the guiding and propagation of the emitted light from a QD\nemitter integrated with the DBB based LMU. The QD-DBB integrated structures can\nserve as the basic element for building nano-optical active circuits for\noptical information processing in both classical and quantum realms.\n", "  For various polymers with different topological structures we numerically\nevaluate the mean-square radius of gyration and the hydrodynamic radius\nsystematically through simulation. We call polymers with nontrivial topology\ntopological polymers. We evaluate the two quantities both for ideal and real\nchain models and show that the ratios of the quantities among different\ntopological types do not depend on the existence of excluded volume if the\ntopological polymers have only up to trivalent vertices, as far as the polymers\ninvestigated. We also evaluate the ratio of the gyration radius to the\nhydrodynamic radius, which we expect to be universal from the viewpoint of\nrenormalization group. Furthermore, we show that the short-distance intrachain\ncorrelation is much enhanced for topological polymers expressed with complex\ngraphs.\n", "  Using nonequilibrium Langevin dynamics simulations of an electrolyte with\nexplicit solvent particles, we investigate the effect of hydrodynamic\ninteractions on the power spectrum of ionic nanopore currents. At low\nfrequency, we find a power-law dependence of the power spectral density, with\nan exponent depending on the ion density. Surprisingly, however, the exponent\nis not affected by the presence of the neutral solvent particles. We conclude\nthat hydrodynamic interactions do not affect the shape of the power spectrum in\nthe frequency range studied.\n", "  Sneutrino inflation employs the fermionic partners of the inflaton and\nstabilizer field as right-handed neutrinos to realize the seesaw mechanism for\nlight neutrino masses. We show that one can improve the latest version of this\nscenario and its consistency with the Planck data by embedding it in the theory\nof cosmological $\\alpha$-attractors.\n", "  We present an obstacle in power scaling of thin-disk lasers related with\nself-driven growth of misalignment due to thermal lens effects. This\nself-driven growth arises from the changes of the optical phase difference at\nthe disk caused by the excursion of the laser eigen-mode from the optical axis.\nWe found a criterion based on a simplified model of this phenomenon which can\nbe applied to design laser resonators insensitive to this effect. Moreover, we\npropose several resonator architectures which are not affected by this effect.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be one of the main source\ncandidates for the high-energy (TeV-PeV) cosmic neutrino flux recently\ndiscovered by the IceCube neutrino observatory. Nevertheless, several\ncorrelation studies between AGN and the cosmic neutrinos detected by IceCube\nshow no significance. Therefore, in this article we consider a specific\nsub-class of AGN for which an increased neutrino production is expected. This\nsub-class contains AGN for which their high-energy jet is pointing toward\nEarth. Furthermore, we impose the condition that the jet is obscured by gas or\ndust surrounding the AGN.\n  A method is presented to determine the total column density of the obscuring\nmedium, which is probed by determining the relative X-ray attenuation with\nrespect to the radio flux as obtained from the AGN spectrum. The total column\ndensity allows us to probe the interaction of the jet with the surrounding\nmatter which leads to additional neutrino production. Finally, starting from\ntwo different source catalogs, this method is applied to specify a sample of\nlow redshift radio galaxies for which an increased neutrino production is\nexpected.\n", "  Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic flowing plasmas are of key\ninterest to several fields of physics (including e.g. laser-wakefield\nacceleration, when viewed in a Lorentz-boosted frame), but remain sometimes\ninfeasible due to the well-known numerical Cherenkov instability (NCI). In this\narticle, we show that, for a plasma drifting at a uniform relativistic\nvelocity, the NCI can be eliminated by simply integrating the PIC equations in\nGalilean coordinates that follow the plasma (also sometimes known as comoving\ncoordinates) within a spectral analytical framework. The elimination of the NCI\nis verified empirically and confirmed by a theoretical analysis of the\ninstability. Moreover, it is shown that this method is applicable both to\nCartesian geometry and to cylindrical geometry with azimuthal Fourier\ndecomposition.\n", "  MSSM4G models, in which the minimal supersymmetric standard model is extended\nto include vector-like copies of standard model particles, are promising\npossibilities for weak-scale supersymmetry. In particular, two models, called\nQUE and QDEE, realize the major virtues of supersymmetry (naturalness\nconsistent with the 125 GeV Higgs boson, gauge coupling unification, and\nthermal relic neutralino dark matter) without the need for fine-tuned relations\nbetween particle masses. We determine the implications of these models for dark\nmatter and collider searches. The QUE and QDEE models revive the possibility of\nheavy Bino dark matter with mass in the range 300-700 GeV, which is not usually\nconsidered. Dark matter direct detection cross sections are typically below\ncurrent limits, but are naturally expected above the neutrino floor and may be\nseen at next-generation experiments. Indirect detection prospects are bright at\nthe Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided the 4th-generation leptons have mass\nabove 350 GeV or decay to taus. In a completely complementary way, discovery\nprospects at the LHC are dim if the 4th-generation leptons are heavy or decay\nto taus, but are bright for 4th-generation leptons with masses below 350 GeV\nthat decay either to electrons or to muons. We conclude that the combined set\nof direct detection, CTA, and LHC experiments will discover or exclude these\nMSSM4G models in the coming few years, assuming the Milky Way has an Einasto\ndark matter profile.\n", "  We study classical solutions in the Weyl-transverse (WTDiff) gravity coupled\nto an electro-magnetic field in four space-time dimensions. The WTDiff gravity\nis invariant under both the local Weyl (conformal) transformation and the\nvolume preserving diffeormorphisms (transverse diffeomorphisms) and is known to\nbe equivalent to general relativity at least at the classical level (perhaps\neven in the quantum regime). In particular, we find that only in four\nspace-time dimensions, the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole metric is a\nclassical solution when it is expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system.\n", "  In the E6 inspired composite Higgs model (E6CHM) the strongly interacting\nsector possesses an SU(6)\\times U(1)_B\\times U(1)_L global symmetry. Near scale\nf\\gtrsim 10 TeV the SU(6) symmetry is broken down to its SU(5) subgroup, that\ninvolves the standard model (SM) gauge group. This breakdown of SU(6) leads to\na set of pseudo--Nambu--Goldstone bosons (pNGBs) including a SM--like Higgs and\na SM singlet pseudoscalar A. Because of the interactions between A and exotic\nfermions, which ensure the approximate unification of the SM gauge couplings\nand anomaly cancellation in this model, the couplings of the pseudoscalar A to\ngauge bosons get induced. As a result, the SM singlet pNGB state A with mass\naround 750 GeV may give rise to sufficiently large cross section of pp\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma that can be identified with the recently observed diphoton excess.\n", "  We discuss the importance of boundary effects on fermionic matter in a\nrotating frame. By explicit calculations at zero temperature we show that the\nscalar condensate of fermion and anti-fermion cannot be modified by the\nrotation once the boundary condition is properly implemented. The situation is\nqualitatively changed at finite temperature and/or in the presence of a\nsufficiently strong magnetic field that supersedes the boundary effects.\nTherefore, to establish an interpretation of the rotation as an effective\nchemical potential, it is crucial to consider further environmental effects\nsuch as the finite temperature and magnetic field.\n", "  Viable modifications of gravity on cosmological scales predominantly rely on\nscreening mechanisms to recover Einstein's Theory of General Relativity in the\nSolar System, where it has been well tested. A parametrisation of the effects\nof such modifications in the spherical collapse model is presented here for the\nuse of modelling the modified nonlinear cosmological structure. The formalism\nallows an embedding of the different screening mechanisms operating in\nscalar-tensor theories through large values of the gravitational potential or\nits first or second derivatives as well as of linear suppression effects or\nmore general transitions between modified and Einstein gravity limits. Each\nscreening or suppression mechanism is parametrised by a time, mass, and\nenvironment dependent screening scale, an effective modified gravitational\ncoupling in the fully unscreened limit that can be matched to linear theory,\nthe exponent of a power-law radial profile of the screened coupling, determined\nby derivatives, symmetries, and potentials in the scalar field equation, and an\ninterpolation rate between the screened and unscreened limits. Along with\ngeneralised perturbative methods, the parametrisation may be used to formulate\na nonlinear extension to the linear parametrised post-Friedmannian framework to\nenable generalised tests of gravity with the wealth of observations from the\nnonlinear cosmological regime.\n", "  The Robo-AO Kepler Planetary Candidate Survey is observing every Kepler\nplanet candidate host star (KOI) with laser adaptive optics imaging to hunt for\nblended nearby stars which may be physically associated companions. With the\nunparalleled efficiency provided by the first fully robotic adaptive optics\nsystem, we perform the critical search for nearby stars (0.15\" to 4.0\"\nseparation with contrasts up to 6 magnitudes) that dilute the observed\nplanetary transit signal, contributing to inaccurate planetary characteristics\nor astrophysical false positives. We present 3313 high resolution observations\nof Kepler planetary hosts from 2012-2015, discovering 479 nearby stars. We\nmeasure an overall nearby star probability rate of 14.5\\pm0.8%. With this large\ndata set, we are uniquely able to explore broad correlations between multiple\nstar systems and the properties of the planets which they host, providing\ninsight into the formation and evolution of planetary systems in our galaxy.\nSeveral KOIs of particular interest will be discussed, including possible\nquadruple star systems hosting planets and updated properties for possible\nrocky planets orbiting with in their star's habitable zone.\n", "  The Southern Robotic Adaptive Optics (SRAO) instrument will bring the proven\nhigh-efficiency capabilities of Robo-AO to the Southern-Hemisphere, providing\nthe unique capability to image with high-angular-resolution thousands of\ntargets per year across the entire sky. Deployed on the modern 4.1m SOAR\ntelescope located on Cerro Tololo, the NGS-AO system will use an innovative\ndual-knife-edge wavefront sensor, similar to a pyramid sensor, to enable\nguiding on targets down to V=16 with diffraction limited resolution in the NIR.\nThe dual-knife-edge wavefront sensor can be up to two orders of magnitude less\ncostly than custom glass pyramids, with similar wavefront error sensitivity and\nminimal chromatic aberrations. SRAO is capable of observing hundreds of targets\na night through automation, allowing confirmation and characterization of the\nlarge number of exoplanets produced by current and future missions.\n", "  One of the cleanest signatures of a heavy Higgs boson in models with\nvectorlike leptons is $H\\to e_4^\\pm \\ell^\\mp \\to h\\ell^+\\ell^-$ which, in two\nHiggs doublet model type-II, can even be the dominant decay mode of heavy\nHiggses. Among the decay modes of the standard model like Higgs boson, $h$, we\nconsider $b \\bar b$ and $\\gamma \\gamma$ as representative channels with sizable\nand negligible background, respectively. We obtained new model independent\nlimits on production cross section for this process from recasting existing\nexperimental searches and interpret them within the two Higgs doublet model. In\naddition, we show that these limits can be improved by about two orders of\nmagnitude with appropriate selection cuts immediately with existing data sets.\nWe also discuss expected sensitivities with integrated luminosity up to 3\nab$^{-1}$ and present a brief overview of other channels.\n", "  Enhancement of the electron fluxes in the inner radiation belt, which is\ninduced by the powerful North West Cape (NWC) very-low-frequency (VLF)\ntransmitter, have been observed and analyzed by several research groups.\nHowever, all of the previous publications have focused on NWC-induced >100-keV\nelectrons only, based on observations from the Detection of Electro-Magnetic\nEmissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions (DEMETER) and the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellites. Here, we present flux\nenhancements with 30--100-keV electrons related to NWC transmitter for the\nfirst time, which were observed by the GOES satellite at night. Similar to the\n100--300-keV precipitated-electron havior, the low energy 30--100-keV electron\nprecipitation is primarily located east of the transmitter. However, the latter\ndoes not drift eastward to the same extent as the former, possibly because of\nthe lower electron velocity. The 30--100-keV electrons are distributed in the\nL=1.8--2.1 shell range, in contrast to the 100--300-keV electrons which are at\nL=1.67--1.9. This is consistent with the perspective that the energy of the\nVLF-wave-induced electron flux enhancement decreases with higher L-shell\nvalues. We expand upon the rationality of the simultaneous enhancement of the\n30--100- and 100--300-keV electron fluxes through comparison with the cyclotron\nresonance theory for the quasi-linear wave-particle interaction. In addition,\nwe interpret the asymmetry characteristics of NWC electric power distribution\nin north and south hemisphere by ray tracing model. Finally, we present\nconsiderable discussion and show that good agreement exists between the\nobservation of satellites and theory.\n", "  Given a weighted graph $G$ embedded in a non-orientable surface $\\Sigma$, one\ncan consider the corresponding weighted graph $\\widetilde{G}$ embedded in the\nso-called orientation cover $\\widetilde\\Sigma$ of $\\Sigma$. We prove identities\nrelating twisted partition functions of the dimer model on these two graphs.\nWhen $\\Sigma$ is the M\\\"obius strip or the Klein bottle, then\n$\\widetilde\\Sigma$ is the cylinder or the torus, respectively, and under some\nnatural assumptions, these identities imply relations between the genuine dimer\npartition functions $Z(G)$ and $Z(\\widetilde{G})$. For example, we show that if\n$G$ is a locally but not globally bipartite graph embedded in the M\\\"obius\nstrip, then $Z(\\widetilde{G})$ is equal to the square of $Z(G)$. This extends\nresults for the square lattice previously obtained by various authors.\n", "  Models endowed with Higgs portals can probe into the hidden sectors of\nparticle physics while providing stable dark matter candidates. Previous\ntree-level computations in such scenarios have shown that experimental bounds\nconstrain dark matter to a very narrow region in parameter space. Aiming at\nimproving the study of the implications of those constraints, we inspect\none-loop corrections to the annihilation cross section for scalar dark matter\ninto observable fermions. We find that these loop contributions might be enough\nto drastically change those results by deforming in about 10% the allowed\nparameter space for dark matter particles with masses even below 1 TeV. These\nfindings encourage further investigation.\n", "  Spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry by the vacuum condensation of an\nantisymmetric $2$-tensor is considered. The coset construction for nonlinear\nrealization of spacetime symmetries is employed to build the most general\nlow-energy effective action for the Goldstone modes interacting with photons.\nWe analyze the model within the context of the Standard-Model Extension and\nnoncommutative QED. Experimental bounds for some parameters of the model are\ndiscussed, and we readdress the subtle issues of stability and causality in\nLorentz non-invariant scenarios. Besides the two photon polarizations, just one\nGoldstone mode must be dynamical to set a sensible low-energy effective model,\nand the enhancement of the stability by accounting interaction terms points to\na protection against observational Lorentz violation.\n", "  We propose a new algorithm to detect the community structure in a network\nthat utilizes both the network structure and vertex attribute data. Suppose we\nhave the network structure together with the vertex attribute data, that is,\nthe information assigned to each vertex associated with the community to which\nit belongs. The problem addressed this paper is the detection of the community\nstructure from the information of both the network structure and the vertex\nattribute data. Our approach is based on the Bayesian approach that models the\nposterior probability distribution of the community labels. The detection of\nthe community structure in our method is achieved by using belief propagation\nand an EM algorithm. We numerically verified the performance of our method\nusing computer-generated networks and real-world networks.\n", "  Si-Ge interdiffusion with a high phosphorus doping level was investigated by\nboth experiments and modeling. Ge/Si1-xGex/Ge multi-layer structures with\n0.75<x_Ge<1 , a mid-10^18 to low-10^19 cm-3 P doping and a dislocation density\nof 10^8 to 10^9 cm-2 range were studied. The P-doped sample shows an\naccelerated Si-Ge interdiffusivity, which is 2-8 times of that of the undoped\nsample. The doping dependence of the Si-Ge interdiffusion was modelled by a\nFermi-enhancement factor. The results show that Si-Ge interdiffusion\ncoefficient is proportional to n^2/n_i^2 for the conditions studied, which\nindicates that the interdiffusion in high Ge fraction range with n-type doping\nis dominated by V^(2-) defects. The Fermi-enhancement factor was shown to have\na relatively weak dependence on the temperature and the Ge fraction. The\nresults are relevant to structure and thermal processing condition design of\nn-type doped Ge/Si and Ge/SiGe based devices such as Ge/Si lasers.\n", "  Cascading failures and epidemic dynamics, as two successful application\nrealms of network science, are usually investigated separately. How do they\naffect each other is still one open, interesting problem. In this letter, we\ncouple both processes and put them into the framework of interdependent\nnetworks, where each network only supports one dynamical process. Of particular\ninterest, they spontaneously form a feedback loop: virus propagation triggers\ncascading failures of systems while cascading failures suppress virus\npropagation. Especially, there exists crucial threshold of virus\ntransmissibility, above which the interdependent networks collapse completely.\nIn addition, the interdependent networks will be more vulnerable if the network\nsupporting virus propagation has denser connections; otherwise the\ninterdependent systems are robust against the change of connections in other\nlayer(s). This discovery differs from previous framework of cascading failure\nin interdependent networks, where better robustness usually needs denser\nconnections. Finally, to protect interdependent networks we also propose the\ncontrol measures based on the identification capability. The larger this\ncapability, more robustness the interdependent networks will be.\n", "  Epidemic spreading on physical contact network will naturally introduce the\nhuman awareness information diffusion on virtual contact network, and the\nawareness diffusion will in turn depress the epidemic spreading, thus forming\nthe competing spreading processes of epidemic and awareness in a multiplex\nnetworks. In this paper, we study the competing dynamics of epidemic and\nawareness, both of which follow the SIR process, in a two-layer networks based\non microscopic Markov chain approach and numerical simulations. We find that\nstrong capacities of awareness diffusion and self-protection of individuals\ncould lead to a much higher epidemic threshold and a smaller outbreak size.\nHowever, the self-awareness of individuals has no obvious effect on the\nepidemic threshold and outbreak size. In addition, the immunization of the\nphysical contact network under the interplay between of epidemic and awareness\nspreading is also investigated. The targeted immunization is found performs\nmuch better than random immunization, and the awareness diffusion could reduce\nthe immunization threshold for both type of random and targeted immunization\nsignificantly.\n", "  We present the in-orbit performance and the first results from the\nultra-violet Imaging telescope (UVIT) on ASTROSAT. UVIT consists of two\nidentical 38cm coaligned telescopes, one for the FUV channel (130-180nm) and\nthe other for the NUV (200-300nm) and VIS (320-550nm) channels, with a field of\nview of 28 $arcmin$. The FUV and the NUV detectors are operated in the high\ngain photon counting mode whereas the VIS detector is operated in the low gain\nintegration mode. The FUV and NUV channels have filters and gratings, whereas\nthe VIS channel has filters. The ASTROSAT was launched on 28th September 2015.\nThe performance verification of UVIT was carried out after the opening of the\nUVIT doors on 30th November 2015, till the end of March 2016 within the\nallotted time of 50 days for calibration. All the on-board systems were found\nto be working satisfactorily. During the PV phase, the UVIT observed several\ncalibration sources to characterise the instrument and a few objects to\ndemonstrate the capability of the UVIT. The resolution of the UVIT was found to\nbe about 1.4 - 1.7 $arcsec$ in the FUV and NUV. The sensitivity in various\nfilters were calibrated using standard stars (white dwarfs), to estimate the\nzero-point magnitudes as well as the flux conversion factor. The gratings were\nalso calibrated to estimate their resolution as well as effective area. The\nsensitivity of the filters were found to be reduced up to 15\\% with respect to\nthe ground calibrations. The sensitivity variation is monitored on a monthly\nbasis. UVIT is all set to roll out science results with its imaging capability\nwith good resolution and large field of view, capability to sample the UV\nspectral region using different filters and capability to perform variability\nstudies in the UV.\n", "  We provide a description of odd-odd self-conjugate nuclei in the sd shell in\na formalism of collective quartets and pairs. Quartets are four-body structures\ncarrying isospin T=0 while pairs can have either T=0 or T=1. Both quartets and\npairs are labeled by the angular momentum J and they are chosen so as to\ndescribe the lowest states of 20Ne (quartets) and the lowest T=0 and T=1 states\nof 18F (pairs). We carry out configuration interaction calculations in spaces\nbuilt by one quartet and one pair for 22Na and by two quartets and one pair for\n26Al. The spectra that are generated are in good agreement with the shell model\nand experimental ones. These calculations confirm the relevance of quartetting\nin the structure of N=Z nuclei that had already emerged in previous studies of\nthe even-even systems and highlight the role of J>0 quartets in the composition\nof the odd-odd spectra.\n", "  Radial velocity instruments require high spectral resolution and extreme\nthermo-mecanical stability, even more difficult to achieve in near-infra red\n(NIR) where the spectrograph has to be cooled down. For a seeing-limited\nspectrograph, the price of high spectral resolution is an increased instrument\nvolume, proportional to the diameter of the primary mirror. A way to control\nthe size, cost, and stability of radial velocity spectrographs is to reduce the\nbeam optical etendue thanks to an Adaptive Optics (AO) system. While AO has\nrevolutionized the field of high angular resolution and high contrast imaging\nduring the last 20 years, it has not yet been (successfully) used as a way to\ncontrol spectrographs size, especially in the field of radial velocities.\n  In this work we present the AO module of the future NIRPS spectrograph for\nthe ESO 3.6 m telescope, that will be feed with multi-mode fibers. We converge\nto an AO system using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor with 14x14\nsubapertures, able to feed 50% of the energy into a 0.4\" fiber in the range of\n0.98 to 1.8 $\\mu m$ for M-type stars as faint as I=12.\n", "  We apply an orthogonalization procedure on the effective field theory of\nlarge scale structure (EFT of LSS) shapes, relevant for the angle-averaged\nbispectrum and non-Gaussian covariance of the matter power spectrum at one\nloop. Assuming natural-sized EFT parameters, this identifies a linear\ncombination of EFT shapes - referred to as the principal shape - that gives the\ndominant contribution for the whole kinematic plane, with subdominant\ncombinations suppressed by a few orders of magnitude. For the covariance, our\northogonal transformation is in excellent agreement with a principal component\nanalysis applied to available data. Additionally we find that, for both\nobservables, the coefficients of the principal shapes are well approximated by\nthe EFT coefficients appearing in the squeezed limit, and are thus measurable\nfrom power spectrum response functions. Employing data from N-body simulations\nfor the growth-only response, we measure the single EFT coefficient describing\nthe angle-averaged bispectrum with $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ precision. These methods\nof shape orthogonalization and measurement of coefficients from response\nfunctions are valuable tools for developing the EFT of LSS framework, and can\nbe applied to more general observables.\n", "  Based on our current understanding of statistics of quantum turbulence as\nwell as on results of intensive ongoing analytical, numerical and experimental\nstudies we overview here the following problems in the large-scale,\nspace-homogeneous, steady-state turbulence of superfluid $^4$He and $^3$He: 1)\nEnergy spectra of normal and superfluid velocity components; 2)\nCross-correlation function of normal and superfluid velocities; 3) Energy\ndissipation by mutual friction and viscosity; 4) Energy exchange between normal\nand superfluid components; 5) High-order statistics and intermittency effects.\nThe statistical properties are discussed for turbulence in different types of\nflows: coflow of $^4$He; turbulent $^3$He with the laminar normal fluid; pure\nsuperflow and counterflow in He-4.\n", "  We overview the current status of photometric analyses of images collected\nwith Multi Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) at 8-10m class telescopes that\noperated, or are operating, on sky. Particular attention will be payed to\nresolved stellar population studies. Stars in crowded stellar systems, such as\nglobular clusters or in nearby galaxies, are ideal test particles to test AO\nperformance. We will focus the discussion on photometric precision and accuracy\nreached nowadays. We briefly describe our project on stellar photometry and\nastrometry of Galactic globular clusters using images taken with GeMS at the\nGemini South telescope. We also present the photometry performed with DAOPHOT\nsuite of programs into the crowded regions of these globulars reaching very\nfaint limiting magnitudes Ks ~21.5 mag on moderately large fields of view (~1.5\narcmin squared). We highlight the need for new algorithms to improve the\nmodeling of the complex variation of the Point Spread Function across the field\nof view. Finally, we outline the role that large samples of stellar standards\nplays in providing a detailed description of the MCAO performance and in\nprecise and accurate colour{magnitude diagrams.\n", "  We extend the four-dimensional unsubtraction method, which is based on the\nloop-tree duality (LTD), to deal with processes involving heavy particles. The\nmethod allows to perform the summation over degenerate IR configurations\ndirectly at integrand level in such a way that NLO corrections can be\nimplemented directly in four space-time dimensions. We define a general\nmomentum mapping between the real and virtual kinematics that accounts properly\nfor the quasi-collinear configurations, and leads to an smooth massless limit.\nWe illustrate the method first with an scalar toy example, and then analyse the\ncase of the decay of a scalar or vector boson into a pair of massive quarks.\nThe results presented in this paper are suitable for the application of the\nmethod to any multipartonic process.\n", "  We present the integration status for `imaka, the ground-layer adaptive\noptics (GLAO) system on the University of Hawaii 2.2-meter telescope on\nMaunakea, Hawaii. This wide-field GLAO pathfinder system exploits Maunakea's\nhighly confined ground layer and weak free-atmosphere to push the corrected\nfield of view to ~1/3 of a degree, an areal field approaching an order of\nmagnitude larger than any existing or planned GLAO system, with a FWHM ~ 0.33\narcseconds in the visible and near infrared. We discuss the unique design\naspects of the instrument, the driving science cases and how they impact the\nsystem, and how we will demonstrate these cases on the sky.\n", "  Phenomenological representations of generalized parton distributions (GPDs)\nimplementing the non-trivial field theoretical requirements are employed in the\npresent day strategies for extracting of hadron structure information encoded\nin GPDs from the observables of hard exclusive reactions. Showing out the\nequivalence of various GPD representations can help to get more insight into\nGPD properties and allow to build up flexible GPD models capable of\nsatisfactory description of the whole set of available experimental data. We\nreview the mathematical aspects of establishing equivalence between the the\ndouble partial wave expansion of GPDs in the conformal partial waves and in the\n$t$-channel ${\\rm SO}(3)$ partial waves and the double distribution\nrepresentation of GPDs.\n", "  We study a second CP symmetry compatible with the $A_4$ flavor group, which\ninterchanges the representations $\\mathbf{1}'$ and $\\mathbf{1}\"$. We analyze\nthe lepton mixing patterns arising from the $A_4$ and CP symmetry broken to\nresidual subgroups $Z_3$ and $Z_2\\times CP$ in the charged lepton and neutrino\nsectors respectively. One phenomenologically viable mixing pattern is found,\nand it predicts maximal atmospheric mixing angle as well as maximal Dirac CP\nphase, trivial Majorana phase and the correlation\n$\\sin^2\\theta_{12}\\cos^2\\theta_{13}=1/3$. We construct a concrete model based\non the $A_4$ and CP symmetry, the above interesting mixing pattern is achieved,\nthe observed charged lepton mass hierarchy is reproduced, and the reactor\nmixing angle $\\theta_{13}$ is of the correct order.\n", "  The measurement of the lattice-parameter of silicon by x-ray interferometry\nassumes the use of strain-free crystals. This might not be the case because\nsurface relaxation, reconstruction, and oxidation cause strains without the\napplication of any external force. In a previous work, this intrinsic strain\nwas estimated by a finite element analysis, where the surface stress was\nmodeled by an elastic membrane having a 1 N/m tensile strength. The present\npaper quantities the surface stress by a density functional theory calculation.\nWe found a value exceeding the nominal value used, which potentially affects\nthe measurement accuracy.\n", "  The average individual is typically a mediocre singer, with a rather\nrestricted capacity to sing a melody in tune. Yet when many singers are\nassembled to perform collectively, the resulting melody of the crowd is\nsuddenly perceived by an external listener as perfectly tuned -as if it was\nactually a choral performance- even if each individual singer is out of tune.\nThis collective phenomenon is an example of a wisdom of crowds effect that can\nbe routinely observed in music concerts or other social events, when a group of\npeople spontaneously sings at unison. In this paper we rely on the\npsychoacoustic properties of pitch and provide a simple mechanistic explanation\nfor the onset of this emergent behavior.\n", "  Systematic measurements of temperature dependent magnetization, resistivity\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) at ambient pressure as\nwell as resistivity under pressures up to 5.25 GPa were conducted on single\ncrystals of CrAuTe$_4$. Magnetization data suggest that magnetic moments are\naligned antiferromagnetically along the crystallographic $c$-axis below\n$T_\\textrm{N}$ = 255 K. ARPES measurements show band reconstruction due to the\nmagnetic ordering. Magnetoresistance data show clear anisotropy, and, at high\nfields, quantum oscillations. The Neel temperature decreases monotonically\nunder pressure, decreasing to $T_\\textrm{N}$ = 236 K at 5.22 GPa. The pressure\ndependencies of (i) $T_\\textrm{N}$, (ii) the residual resistivity ratio, and\n(iii) the size and power-law behavior of the low temperature magnetoresistance\nall show anomalies near 2 GPa suggesting that there may be a phase transition\n(structural, magnetic, and/or electronic) induced by pressure. For pressures\nhigher than 2 GPa a significantly different quantum oscillation frequency\nemerges, consistent with a pressure induced change in the electronic states.\n", "  Soon, new experiments at FNAL and J-PARC will measure the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moments with better accuracy than before. From theoretical side, the\nuncertainty of the standard model prediction is dominated by the hadronic\ncontributions. Current status of the experimental data and theoretical\ncalculations are briefly discussed.\n", "  We investigate the formation and dissipation of large scale neutrino\nstructures in cosmologies where the time evolution of dynamical dark energy is\nstopped by a growing neutrino mass. In models where the coupling between\nneutrinos and dark energy grows with the value of the scalar cosmon field, the\nevolution of neutrino lumps depends on the neutrino mass. For small masses the\nlumps form and dissolve periodically, leaving only a small backreaction of the\nneutrino structures on the cosmic evolution. This process heats the neutrinos\nto temperatures much above the photon temperature such that neutrinos acquire\nagain an almost relativistic equation of state. The present equation of state\nof the combined cosmon-neutrino fluid is very close to -1. In contrast, for\nlarger neutrino masses the lumps become stable. The highly concentrated\nneutrino structures entail a large backreaction similar to the case of a\nconstant neutrino-cosmon coupling. A present average neutrino mass of around\n0.5 eV seems so far compatible with observation. For masses lower than this\nvalue, neutrino induced gravitational potentials remain small, making the lumps\ndifficult to detect.\n", "  To investigate fractoluminescence in scintillating crystals used for particle\ndetection, we have developed a multi-channel setup built around samples of\ndouble-cleavage drilled compression (DCDC) geometry in a controllable\natmosphere. The setup allows the continuous digitization over hours of various\nparameters, including the applied load, and the compressive strain of the\nsample, as well as the acoustic emission. Emitted visible light is recorded\nwith nanosecond resolution, and crack propagation is monitored using infrared\nlighting and camera. An example of application to Bi4Ge3O12 (BGO) is provided.\n", "  We review some of the recent achievements of the Joint Physics Analysis\nCenter, a theoretical collaboration with ties to experimental collaborations,\nthat aims to provide amplitudes suitable for the analysis of the current and\nforthcoming experimental data on hadron physics. Since its foundation in 2013,\nthe group is focused on hadron spectroscopy in preparation for the forthcoming\nhigh statistics and high precision experimental data from BELLEII, BESIII,\nCLAS12, COMPASS, GlueX, LHCb and (hopefully) PANDA collaborations. So far, we\nhave developed amplitudes for $\\pi N$ scattering, $\\bar{K}N$ scattering, pion\nand $J/\\psi$ photoproduction, two kaon photoproduction and three-body decays of\nlight mesons ($\\eta$, $\\omega$, $\\phi$). The codes for the amplitudes are\navailable to download from the group web page and can be straightforwardly\nincorporated to the analysis of the experimental data.\n", "  The correct description of Double Parton Scattering (DPS), which represents a\nbackground in several channels for the search of new Physics at the LHC,\nrequires the knowledge of double parton distribution functions (dPDFs). These\nquantities represent also a novel tool for the study of the three-dimensional\nnucleon structure, complementary to the possibilities offered by\nelectromagnetic probes. In this paper we analyze dPDFs using Poincar\\'e\ncovariant predictions obtained by using a Light-Front constituent quark model\nproposed in a recent paper, and QCD evolution. We study to what extent\nfactorized expressions for dPDFs, which neglect, at least in part, two-parton\ncorrelations, can be used. We show that they fail in reproducing the calculated\ndPDFs, in particular in the valence region. Actually measurable processes at\nexisting facilities occur at low longitudinal momenta of the interacting\npartons; to have contact with these processes we have analyzed correlations\nbetween pairs of partons of different kind, finding that, in some cases, they\nare strongly suppressed at low longitudinal momenta, while for other\ndistributions they can be sizeable. For example, the effect of gluon-gluon\ncorrelations can be as large as 20 $\\%$. We have shown that these behaviors can\nbe understood in terms of a delicate interference of non-perturbative\ncorrelations, generated by the dynamics of the model, and perturbative ones,\ngenerated by the model independent evolution procedure. Our analysis shows that\nat LHC kinematics two-parton correlations can be relevant in DPS, and therefore\nwe address the possibility to study them experimentally.\n", "  We analytically evaluate the three-loop Feynman integral which was the last\nmissing ingredient for the analytical evaluation of the three-loop quark static\npotential. To evaluate the integral we introduce an auxiliary parameter $y$,\nwhich corresponds to the residual energy in some of the HQET propagators. We\nconstruct a differential system for 109 master integrals depending on $y$ and\nfix boundary conditions from the asymptotic behaviour in the limit $y\\to\n\\infty$. The original integral is recovered from the limit $y\\to 0$. To solve\nthese linear differential equations we try to find an $\\epsilon$-form of the\ndifferential system. Though this step appears to be, strictly speaking, not\npossible, we succeed to find an $\\epsilon$-form of all irreducible diagonal\nblocks, which is sufficient for solving the differential system in terms of an\n$\\epsilon$ expansion. We find a solution up to weight six in terms of multiple\npolylogarithms and obtain an analytical result for the required three-loop\nFeynman integral by taking the limit $y\\to 0$. As a by-product, we obtain\nanalytical results for some Feynman integrals typical for HQET.\n", "  We investigate a model for fatigue crack growth in which damage accumulation\nis assumed to follow a power law of the local stress amplitude, a form which\ncan be generically justified on the grounds of the approximately self-similar\naspect of microcrack distributions. Our aim is to determine the relation\nbetween model ingredients and the Paris exponent governing subcritical\ncrack-growth dynamics at the macroscopic scale, starting from a single small\nnotch propagating along a fixed line. By a series of analytical and numerical\ncalculations, we show that, in the absence of disorder, there is a critical\ndamage-accumulation exponent $\\gamma$, namely $\\gamma_c=2$, separating two\ndistinct regimes of behavior for the Paris exponent $m$. For $\\gamma>\\gamma_c$,\nthe Paris exponent is shown to assume the value $m=\\gamma$, a result which\nproves robust against the separate introduction of various modifying\ningredients. Explicitly, we deal here with (i) the requirement of a minimum\nstress for damage to occur; (ii) the presence of disorder in local damage\nthresholds; (iii) the possibility of crack healing. On the other hand, in the\nregime $\\gamma<\\gamma_c$ the Paris exponent is seen to be sensitive to the\ndifferent ingredients added to the model, with rapid healing or a high minimum\nstress for damage leading to $m=2$ for all $\\gamma<\\gamma_c$, in contrast with\nthe linear dependence $m=6-2\\gamma$ observed for very long characteristic\nhealing times in the absence of a minimum stress for damage. Upon the\nintroduction of disorder on the local fatigue thresholds, which leads to the\npossible appearance of multiple cracks along the propagation line, the Paris\nexponent tends to $m\\approx 4$ for $\\gamma\\lesssim 2$, while retaining the\nbehavior $m=\\gamma$ for $\\gamma\\gtrsim 4$.\n", "  The Born-Infeld theory of the gravitational field formulated in Weitzenbock\nspacetime is studied in detail. The action, constructed quadratically upon the\ntorsion two-form, reduces to Einstein gravity in the low field limit where the\nBorn-Infeld constant goes to infinity, and it is described by second order\nfield equations for the vielbein field in $D$ spacetime dimensions. The\nequations of motion are derived, and a number of properties coming from them\nare discussed. In particular, we show that under fairly general circumstances,\nthe equations of motion are those of Einstein's General Relativity plus an\nenergy-momentum tensor of purely geometrical character. This tensor is obtained\nsolely from the parallelization defining the spacetime structure, which is\nencoded in a set of D smooth, everywhere non-null, globally defined 1-forms.\nSpherical symmetry is studied as an example, and we comment on the emergence of\nthe Schwarzschild geometry within this framework. Potential (regular)\nextensions of it are envisioned.\n", "  The goal of the present study is to extend our current knowledge of the\ndiffuse radio source (halo and relic) populations to $z$ $>$ 0.3. Here we\nreport GMRT and EVLA radio observations of six galaxy clusters taken from the\nMAssive Cluster Survey (MACS) catalogue to detect diffuse radio emission. We\nused archival GMRT (150, 235 and 610 MHz) and EVLA (L band) data and made\nimages at multiple radio frequencies of the following six clusters -\nMACSJ0417.5-1154, MACSJ1131.8-1955, MACSJ0308.9+2645, MACSJ2243.3-0935,\nMACSJ2228.5+2036 and MACSJ0358.8-2955. We detect diffuse radio emission (halo\nor relic or both) in the first four clusters. In the last two clusters we do\nnot detect any diffuse radio emission but we put stringent upper-limits on\ntheir radio powers. We also use archival {\\it Chandra} X-ray data to carry out\nmorphology and substructure analysis of these clusters. We find that based on\nX-ray data, these MACS clusters are non-relaxed and show substructures in their\ntemperature distribution. The radio powers of the first four MACS clusters are\nconsistent with their expected values in the $L_{x}$--$P_{1.4GHz}$ plot.\n{However, we found ultra-steep spectrum radio halo in the MACSJ0417.5-1154\ncluster whose rest-frame cut-off frequency is at $\\sim$ 900 MHz}. The remaining\ntwo clusters whose radio powers are $\\sim$ 11 times below the expected values\nare most likely to be in the `off-state' as has been postulated in some of the\nmodels of radio halo formation.\n", "  We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 850um\ncontinuum observations of the original Lyman-alpha Blob (LAB) in the SSA22\nfield at z=3.1 (SSA22-LAB01). The ALMA map resolves the previously identified\nsubmillimeter source into three components with total flux density S_850 =\n1.68+/-0.06 mJy, corresponding to a star formation rate of ~150 M_sun/yr. The\nsubmillimeter sources are associated with several faint (m~27 mag) rest-frame\nultraviolet sources identified in Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\n(STIS) clear filter imaging (~5850A). One of these companions is\nspectroscopically confirmed with Keck MOSFIRE to lie within 20 projected kpc\nand 250 km/s of one of the ALMA components. We postulate that some of these\nSTIS sources represent a population of low-mass star-forming satellites\nsurrounding the central submillimeter sources, potentially contributing to\ntheir growth and activity through accretion. Using a high resolution\ncosmological zoom simulation of a 10^13 M_sun halo at z=3, including stellar,\ndust and Ly-alpha radiative transfer, we can model the ALMA+STIS observations\nand demonstrate that Ly-alpha photons escaping from the central submillimeter\nsources are expected to resonantly scatter in neutral hydrogen, the majority of\nwhich is predicted to be associated with halo substructure. We show how this\nprocess gives rise to extended Ly-alpha emission with similar surface\nbrightness and morphology to observed giant LABs.\n", "  We construct black hole solutions of type IIB supergravity that are\nholographically dual to anisotropic plasmas arising from deformations of an\ninfinite class of four-dimensional CFTs. The CFTs are dual to $AdS_5\\times\nX_5$, where $X_5$ is an Einstein manifold, and the deformations involve the\ntype IIB axion and dilaton, with non-trivial periodic dependence on one of the\nspatial directions of the CFT. At low temperatures the solutions approach\nsmooth domain wall solutions with the same $AdS_5\\times X_5$ solution appearing\nin the far IR. For sufficiently large deformations an intermediate scaling\nregime appears which is governed by a Lifshitz-like scaling solution. We\ncalculate the DC thermal conductivity and some components of the shear\nviscosity tensor.\n", "  This article reports a measurement of the proper motion of Leo II, a dwarf\ngalaxy that is a likely satellite of the Milky Way, based on imaging with the\nHubble Space Telescope and Wide Field Camera 3. The measurement uses compact\nbackground galaxies as standards of rest in both channels of the camera for two\ndistinct pointings of the telescope and a QSO in one channel for each pointing,\nresulting in the weighted average of six measurements. The measured proper\nmotion in the the equatorial coordinate system is (mu_alpha, mu_delta) = (-6.9\n+- 3.7, -8.7 +- 3.9) mas/century and in the Galactic coordinate system is\n(mu_l, mu_b) = (6.2 +- 3.9, -9.2 +- 3.7) mas/century. The implied space\nvelocity with respect to the Galactic center is (Pi, Theta, Z) = (-37 +- 38,\n117 +- 43, 40 +- 16) km/s or, expressed in Galactocentric radial and tangential\ncomponents, (V_r, V_tan) = (21.9 +- 1.5, 127 +- 42) km/s. The space velocity\nimplies that the instantaneous orbital inclination is 68 degrees, with a 95%\nconfidence interval of (66 deg, 80 deg). The measured motion supports the\nhypothesis that Leo II, Leo IV, Leo V, Crater 2, and the globular cluster\nCrater fell into the Milky Way as a group.\n", "  We theoretically study the creation of single- and multi-phonon Fock states\nand arbitrary superpositions of quantum phonon states in a nanomechanical\ncarbon nanotube (CNT) resonator. In our model, a doubly clamped CNT resonator\nis initialized in the ground state and a single electron is trapped in a\nquantum dot which is formed by a electric gate potential and brought into the\nmagnetic field of a micro-magnet. The preparation of arbitrary quantum phonon\nstates is based on the coupling between the mechanical motion of the CNT and\nthe electron spin which acts as a non-linearity. We assume that electrical\ndriving pulses with different frequencies are applied on the system. The\nquantum information is transferred from the spin qubit to the mechanical motion\nby the spin-phonon coupling and the electron spin qubit can be reset by the\nsingle-electron spin resonance. We describe Wigner tomography which can be\napplied at the end to obtain the phase information of the prepared phonon\nstates.\n", "  Luminous quasars at z>5.6 can be studied in detail with the current\ngeneration of telescopes and provide us with unique information on the first\ngigayear of the universe. Thus far these studies have been statistically\nlimited by the number of quasars known at these redshifts. Such quasars are\nrare and therefore wide-field surveys are required to identify them and\nmultiwavelength data are needed to separate them efficiently from their main\ncontaminants, the far more numerous cool dwarfs. In this paper, we update and\nextend the selection for z~6 quasars presented in Banados et al. (2014) using\nthe Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) survey. We present the PS1 distant quasar sample, which\ncurrently consists of 124 quasars in the redshift range 5.6<z<6.7 that satisfy\nour selection criteria. Seventy-seven of these quasars have been discovered\nwith PS1, and 63 of them are newly identified in this paper. We present\ncomposite spectra of the PS1 distant quasar sample. This sample spans a factor\nof ~20 in luminosity and shows a variety of emission line properties. The\nnumber of quasars at z>5.6 presented in this work almost double the quasars\npreviously known at these redshifts, marking a transition phase from studies of\nindividual sources to statistical studies of the high-redshift quasar\npopulation, which was impossible with earlier, smaller samples.\n", "  The Gamma-ray Cherenkov Telescope (GCT) is proposed for the Small-Sized\nTelescope component of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). GCT's dual-mirror\nSchwarzschild-Couder (SC) optical system allows the use of a compact camera\nwith small form-factor photosensors. The GCT camera is ~0.4 m in diameter and\nhas 2048 pixels; each pixel has a ~0.2 degree angular size, resulting in a wide\nfield-of-view. The design of the GCT camera is high performance at low cost,\nwith the camera housing 32 front-end electronics modules providing full\nwaveform information for all of the camera's 2048 pixels. The first GCT camera\nprototype, CHEC-M, was commissioned during 2015, culminating in the first\nCherenkov images recorded by a SC telescope and the first light of a CTA\nprototype. In this contribution we give a detailed description of the GCT\ncamera and present preliminary results from CHEC-M's commissioning.\n", "  We study the non-dissipative transport effects appearing at second order in\nthe hydrodynamic expansion for a non-interacting gas of chiral fermions by\nusing the partition function formalism. We discuss some features of the\ncorresponding constitutive relations, derive the explicit expressions for the\nconductivities and compare with existing results in the literature.\n", "  While the vast majority of multiple-planet systems have their orbital angular\nmomentum axes aligned with the spin axis of their host star, Kepler-56 is an\nexception: its two transiting planets are coplanar yet misaligned by at least\n40 degrees with respect to their host star. Additional follow-up observations\nof Kepler-56 suggest the presence of a massive, non-transiting companion that\nmay help explain this misalignment. We model the transit data along with\nKeck/HIRES and HARPS-N radial velocity data to update the masses of the two\ntransiting planets and infer the physical properties of the third,\nnon-transiting planet. We employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to\ncalculate the best-fitting orbital parameters and their uncertainties for each\nplanet. We find the outer planet has a period of 1002 $\\pm$ 5 days and minimum\nmass of 5.61 $\\pm$ 0.38 Jupiter masses. We also place a 95% upper limit of 0.80\nm/s/yr on long-term trends caused by additional, more distant companions.\n", "  We use fluctuating hydrodynamics to analyze the dynamical properties in the\nnon-equilibrium steady state of a diffusive system coupled with reservoirs. We\nderive the two-time correlations of the density and of the current in the\nhydrodynamic limit in terms of the diffusivity and the mobility. Within this\nhydrodynamic framework we discuss a generalization of the fluctuation\ndissipation relation in a non-equilibrium steady state where the response\nfunction is expressed in terms of the two-time correlations. We compare our\nresults to an exact solution of the symmetric exclusion process. This exact\nsolution also allows one to directly verify the fluctuating hydrodynamics\nequation.\n", "  We present the analysis of an eccentric, partially eclipsing long-period\n($P=19.23$ d) binary system KIC 9777062 that contains main sequence stars near\nthe turnoff of the intermediate age open cluster NGC 6811. The primary is a\nmetal-lined Am star with a possible convective blueshift to its radial\nvelocities, and one star (probably the secondary) is likely to be a $\\gamma$\nDor pulsator. The component masses are $1.603\\pm0.006$(stat.)$\\pm0.016$(sys.)\nand $1.419\\pm0.003\\pm0.008 M_\\odot$, and the radii are $1.744\\pm0.004\\pm0.002$\nand $1.544\\pm0.002\\pm0.002 R_\\odot$. The isochrone ages of the stars are mildly\ninconsistent: the age from the mass-radius combination for the primary\n($1.05\\pm0.05\\pm0.09$ Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from\nmodels and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary\n($1.21\\pm0.05\\pm0.15$ Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the\ncolor-magnitude diagram ($1.00\\pm0.05$ Gyr).\n  We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters $\\Delta\n\\nu$ and $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of\nthe stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller)\nthan predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars.\n  The majority of stars near the cluster turnoff are pulsating stars: we\nidentify a sample of 28 $\\delta$ Sct, 15 $\\gamma$ Dor, and 5 hybrid types. We\nused the period-luminosity relation for high-amplitude $\\delta$ Sct stars to\nfit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding\n$(m-M)_V = 10.37\\pm0.03$. This is larger than most previous determinations, but\nsmaller than values derived from the eclipsing binary ($10.47\\pm0.05$).\n", "  In this paper we define the notion of semi-regular biorthogonal pairs what is\na generalization of regular biorthogonal pairs in Ref. \\cite{hiroshi1} and show\nthat if $(\\{ \\phi_{n} \\} , \\{ \\psi_{n} \\})$ is a semi-regular biorthogonal\npair, then $\\{ \\phi_{n} \\}$ and $\\{ \\psi_{n} \\}$ are generalized Riesz bases.\nThis result improves the results of Ref. \\cite{h-t, hiroshi1, h-t2} in the\nregular case.\n", "  The power of the helicity formalism has been appreciated recently from its\napplication to the massless case, where plenty of formal aspects of multi-legs\namplitudes have been derived. However, in order to extend the formalism to the\nrealistic cases, such as the electroweak Standard Model and QCD with massive\nquarks, some extra inputs are needed. We discuss first the formalism needed to\nevaluate amplitudes expressed with the modern notation for massive fermions and\nvectors based on a thorough treatment of Proca vector fields. Then, we present\nsome examples of elementary processes where it is shown how the formalism leads\nto tremendous simplifications, these include 2-body decays $Z\\to ff$, $h\\to ff$\nand $h\\to W^{-}W^{+}$ as well as the 3-body decay $h\\to V f'\\bar{f}$.\n", "  We study inelastic interactions of particles with quantized vortices in\nsuperfluids by using a semi-classical matter wave theory that is analogous to\nthe Landau two-fluid equations, but allows for the vortex dynamics. The\nresearch is motivated by recent experiments on xenon doped helium nanodroplets\nthat show clustering of the impurities along the vortex cores. We numerically\nsimulate the dynamics of trapping and interactions of xenon atoms by quantized\nvortices in superfluid helium and the obtained results can be extended to\nscattering of other impurities by quantized vortices. Different energies and\nimpact parameters of incident particles are considered. We show that inelastic\nscattering is closely linked to the generation of Kelvin waves along a\nquantized vortex during the interaction even if there is no capture. The\ncapture criterion of an impurity is formulated in terms of the binding energy.\n", "  The sound wave in dense quark matter is subject to strong absorption due to\ndiquark field fluctuations above T critical. The result is another facet of\nMandelshtam-Leontovich slow relaxation time theory.\n", "  In the past few years a wealth of high quality data has made possible to test\ncurrent theoretical ideas about the properties of hadrons subject to extreme\nconditions of density and temperature. The relativistic heavy-ion program\ncarried out at the CERN-SPS and under development at the BNL-RHIC and CERN-LHC\nhas provided results that probe the evolution of collisions of hadronic matter\nat high energies from the initially large density to the late dilute stages. In\naddition, QCD on the lattice has produced results complementing these findings\nwith first principles calculations for observables in a regime where\nperturbative techniques cannot describe the nature of strongly coupled systems.\nThis work aims to review some recent developments that make use of field\ntheoretical methods to describe the physics of hadrons at finite temperature\nand density. I concentrate on two of the main topics that have been explored in\nthe last few years: (1) The search for the structure of the phase diagram and\n(2) analytical signals linked to the chiral symmetry restoration/deconfinement.\n", "  We introduce a new set of symmetries obeyed by tree-level gauge-theory\namplitudes involving at least one gluon. The symmetry acts as a\nmomentum-dependent shift on the color factors of the amplitude. Using the\nradiation vertex expansion, we prove the invariance under this color-factor\nshift of the $n$-gluon amplitude, as well as amplitudes involving massless or\nmassive particles in an arbitrary representation of the gauge group with spin\nzero, one-half, or one. The Bern-Carrasco-Johansson relations are a direct\nconsequence of this symmetry.\n  We also introduce the cubic vertex expansion of an amplitude, and use it to\nderive a generalized-gauge-invariant constraint on the kinematic numerators of\nthe amplitude. We show that the amplitudes of the bi-adjoint scalar theory are\ninvariant under the color-factor symmetry, and use this to derive the null\neigenvectors of the propagator matrix.\n  We generalize the color-factor shift to loop level, and prove the invariance\nunder this shift of one-loop $n$-gluon amplitudes in any theory that admits a\ncolor-kinematic-dual representation of numerators. We show that the one-loop\ncolor-factor symmetry implies known relations among the integrands of one-loop\ncolor-ordered amplitudes.\n", "  We report on the phenomenological results obtained through Dihadron\nFragmentation Functions related processes. In 2015, an update on the fitting\ntechniques for the Dihadron Fragmentation Functions has led to an improved\nextraction of the transversity PDF and, as a consequence, the nucleon tensor\ncharge. We discuss the impact of the determination of the latter on search for\nphysics Beyond the Standard Model, focusing on the error treatment. We also\ncomment on the future of the extraction of the subleading-twist PDF $e(x)$ from\nJLab soon-to-be-released Beam Spin Asymmetry data.\n", "  Motivated by the resurgence of electronic and optical property design in\nordered fluoride and oxyfluoride compounds, we present a density functional\ntheory (DFT) study on 19 materials with structures, ranging from simple to\ncomplex, and variable oxygen-to-fluorine ratios. We focus on understanding the\naccuracy of the exchange-correlation potentials ($V_{xc}$) to DFT for the\nprediction of structural, electronic, and lattice dynamical properties at four\ndifferent levels of theory, \\emph{i.e.}, the local density approximation (LDA),\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA), metaGGA, and hybrid functional level\nwhich includes fractions of exact exchange. We investigate in detail the\nmetaGGA functionals MS2 [Sun \\emph{et al}., Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett., \\textbf{111},\n106401 (2013)] and SCAN [Sun \\emph{et al}., Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett., \\textbf{115},\n036402 (2015)], and show that although the metaGGAs show improvements over the\nLDA and GGA functionals in describing the electronic structure and phonon\nfrequencies, the static structural properties of fluorides and oxyfluorides are\noften more accurately predicted by the GGA-level functional PBEsol. Results\nfrom LDA calculations are unsatisfactory for any compound regardless of oxygen\nconcentration. PBEsol or HSE06 gives good performance in all oxide or all\nfluoride compounds. For the oxyfluorides, PBEsol is consistently more accurate\nfor structural properties across all oxygen concentrations, however, we stress\nthe need for detailed property assessment with various functionals for\noxyfluorides with variable composition. The \"best\" functional is anticipated to\nbe more strongly dependent on the property of interest. Our study provides\nuseful insights in selecting an $V_{xc}$ that achieves the best performance\ncomprise, enabling more accurate predictive design of functional fluoride-based\nmaterials with density functional theory.\n", "  We present explicit examples of semi-realistic heterotic models with\nspontaneously broken supersymmetry, which dynamically lead to breaking scales\nmuch smaller than $M_{\\rm Planck}$ and exponentially small positive values for\nthe cosmological constant. Contrary to field theoretic intuition, we find that\nthe global structure of the effective potential is significantly affected by\ncontributions of massive and non-level matched string states and we investigate\nthe conditions that dynamically ensure a number of desired properties.\n", "  High-energy nucleon total cross sections are related to low-x DIS structure\nfunctions by using the additive quark model.\n", "  We study asymptotic charges for symmetric massless higher-spin fields on Anti\nde Sitter backgrounds of arbitrary dimension within the canonical formalism. We\nfirst analyse in detail the spin-3 example: we cast Fronsdal's action in\nHamiltonian form, we derive the charges and we propose boundary conditions on\nthe canonical variables that secure their finiteness. We then extend the\ncomputation of charges and the characterisation of boundary conditions to\narbitrary spin.\n", "  A symmetry-preserving truncation of the two-body light-quark bound-state\nproblem in relativistic quantum field theory is used to calculate the\nleading-twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) of scalar systems, both\nground-state and radial excitations, and the radial excitations of vector\nmesons. Owing to the fact that the scale-independent leptonic decay constant of\na scalar meson constituted from equal-mass valence-constituents vanishes, it is\nfound that the PDA of a given scalar system possesses one more zero than that\nof an analogous vector meson. Consequently, whereas the mean light-front\nrelative momentum of the valence-constituents within a vector meson is zero,\nthat within a scalar meson is large, an outcome which hints at a greater role\nfor light-front angular momentum in systems classified as $P$-wave in quantum\nmechanical models. Values for the scale-dependent decay constants of\nground-state scalar and vector systems are a by-product of this analysis, and\nthey turn out to be roughly equal, viz. $\\simeq 0.2\\,$GeV at an hadronic scale.\nIn addition, it is confirmed that the dilation characterising ground-state PDAs\nis manifest in the PDAs of radial excitations too. The impact of\n$SU(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking is also considered. When compared with\npseudoscalar states, it is a little stronger in scalar systems, but the size is\nnevertheless determined by the flavour-dependence of dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking and the PDAs are still skewed toward the heavier valence-quark in\nasymmetric systems.\n", "  The geosynchronous Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (gLISA) is a\nspace-based gravitational wave (GW) mission that, for the past five years, has\nbeen under joint study at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford University,\nthe National Institute for Space Research (I.N.P.E., Brazil), and Space Systems\nLoral. If flown at the same time as the LISA mission, the two arrays will\ndeliver a joint sensitivity that accounts for the best performance of both\nmissions in their respective parts of the mHz band. This simultaneous operation\nwill result in an optimally combined sensitivity curve that is \"white\" from a\nfew mHz to 1 Hz, making the two antennas capable of detecting, with high\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), coalescing black-hole binaries (BHBs) with\nmasses in the range (10 - 100 million) solar masses. Their ability of jointly\ntracking, with enhanced SNR, signals similar to that observed by the Advanced\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO) on September 14,\n2015 (the GW150914 event) will result in a larger number of observable\nsmall-mass binary black-holes and an improved precision of the parameters\ncharacterizing these sources. Together, LISA, gLISA and aLIGO will cover, with\ngood sensitivity, a frequency band from a tenth of a mHz to a kHz frequency\nband.\n", "  We study the effects of the exact top-quark mass dependent two-loop\ncorrections to Higgs boson pair production by gluon fusion at the LHC and at a\n100 TeV hadron collider. We perform a detailed comparison of the full\nnext-to-leading order result to various approximations at the level of\ndifferential distributions and also analyse non-standard Higgs self-coupling\nscenarios. We find that the different next-to-leading order approximations\ndiffer from the full result by up to 50 percent in relevant differential\ndistributions. This clearly stresses the importance of the full NLO result.\n", "  Using the quantum field theory methods, we calculate the helicity flip of an\nelectron scattering off protons in dense matter of a neutron star. The\ninfluence of the electroweak interaction between electrons and background\nnucleons on the helicity flip is examined. We also derive the kinetic equation\nfor the chiral imbalance. The derived kinetic equation is compared with the\nresults obtained by other authors.\n", "  For the Fe-based superconductor Fe{1+y}Te{1-x}S{x}, superconductivity is\ninduced by annealing treatment in oxygen atmosphere, whereas as-grown samples\ndo not show superconductivity. We have investigated the sample-size dependence\nof O2-annealing effects in Fe1.01Te0.91S0.09. The annealing conditions are\nfixed to be 1 atm, 200 C, and 2 hours. We have carried out magnetic\nsusceptibility and specific heat measurements in order to evaluate the\nsuperconducting volume fraction. We have found that Fe{1+y}Te{1-x}S{x} has an\noptimal size for the induction of bulk superconductivity by O2 annealing. Our\nresults indicate that O2 annealing is probably effective near the surface of\nsamples over a length of a few tens of micro meters.\n", "  Silicon is an ideal material for on-chip applications, however its poor\nacoustic properties limit its performance for important optoacoustic\napplications, particularly for Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS). We\ntheoretically show that silicon inverse opals exhibit a strongly improved\nacoustic performance that enhances the bulk SBS gain coefficient by more than\ntwo orders of magnitude. We also design a waveguide that incorporates silicon\ninverse opals and which has SBS gain values that are comparable with\nchalcogenide glass waveguides. This research opens new directions for\nopto-acoustic applications in on-chip material systems.\n", "  Lovelock theory of gravity -and, in particular, Einstein theory- admits black\nhole solutions that can be equipped with a hair by conformally coupling the\ntheory to a real scalar field. This is a secondary hair, meaning that it does\nnot endow the black hole with new quantum numbers. It rather consists of a\nnon-trivial scalar field profile of fixed intensity which turns out to be\nregular everywhere outside and on the horizon and, provided the cosmological\nconstant is negative, behaves at large distance in a way compatible with the\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic. In this paper, we review the main features of\nthese hairy black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamical\nproperties. The conformal coupling to matter in dimension $D>4$ in principle\nincludes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained from the Lovelock\naction through the Stueckelberg strategy. As a consequence, the resulting\nscalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality under field redefinition that\nresembles T-duality. Through this field redefinition, the matter content of the\ntheory transforms into a Lovelock action for a dual geometry. Since the hairy\nblack holes only exist for special relations between the dual Lovelock coupling\nconstants, it is natural to compare those relations with the causality bounds\ncoming from AdS/CFT. We observe that, while the lower causality bound is always\nobeyed, the upper causality bound is violated. The latter, however, is\nsaturated in the large $D$ limit.\n", "  We examine the degree to which observations of large-scale cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization can shed light on the puzzling large-scale power\nmodulation in maps of CMB anisotropy. We consider a phenomenological model in\nwhich the observed anomaly is caused by modulation of large-scale primordial\ncurvature perturbations, and calculate Fisher information and error forecasts\nfor future polarization data, constrained by the existing CMB anisotropy data.\nBecause a significant fraction of the available information is contained in\ncorrelations with the anomalous temperature data, it is essential to account\nfor these constraints. We also present a systematic approach to finding a set\nof normal modes that maximize the available information, generalizing the\nwell-known Karhunen-Loeve transformation to take account of the constraints\nfrom the temperature data. A polarization map covering at least $\\sim 60\\%$ of\nthe sky should be able to provide a $3\\sigma$ detection of modulation at the\nlevel favored by the temperature data. A significant fraction of the\ninformation in such a data set is contained in the single mode that optimally\nencapsulates the signal due to temperature-polarization correlation.\n", "  We demonstrate a convenient and fast method to measure the spectrally\nresolved far-fields of multimode terahertz quantum cascade lasers by combining\na microbolometer focal plane array with an FTIR spectrometer. Far-fields of\nfundamental TM0 and higher lateral order TM1 modes of multimode Fabry-P\\'erot\ntype lasers have been distinguished, which very well fit to the results\nobtained by a 3D finite-element simulation. Furthermore, multimode random laser\ncavities have been investigated, analyzing the contribution of each single\nlaser mode to the total far-field. The presented method is thus an important\ntool to gain in-depth knowledge of the emission properties of multimode laser\ncavities at terahertz frequencies, which become increasingly important for\nfuture sensing applications.\n", "  Tree-level $n$-point gauge-theory amplitudes with $n-2k$ gluons and $k$ pairs\nof (massless or massive) particles in the fundamental (or other) representation\nof the gauge group are invariant under a set of symmetries that act as\nmomentum-dependent shifts on the color factors in the cubic decomposition of\nthe amplitude. These symmetries lead to gauge-invariant constraints on the\nkinematic numerators. They also directly imply the BCJ relations among the\nMelia-basis primitive amplitudes previously obtained by Johansson and Ochirov.\n", "  Flavor transitions via the charged current interactions are parametrized by a\nthree dimensional and unitary transformation. This so called mixing matrix\nrequires of four mixing parameters. Here we show that under the\nphenomenological observation of hierarchical fermion masses, $m_3 \\gg m_2 \\gg\nm_1$, a mixing parametrization can be built with its mixing parameters being\nthe corresponding four independent mass ratios of each fermion sector, i.e.,\n$m_u/m_c$, $m_c/m_t$, $m_d/m_s$, and $m_s/m_b$ and $m_e/m_\\mu$, $m_\\mu/m_\\tau$,\n$m_{\\nu 1}/m_{\\nu 2}$, and $m_{\\nu\n  2}/m_{\\nu 3}$, for the quark and lepton sector, respectively.\n", "  AdS spacetime has been shown numerically to be unstable against a large class\nof arbitrarily small perturbations. In arXiv:1410.1869, the authors presented a\npreliminary study of the effects on stability of changing the local dynamics by\nadding a Gauss-Bonnet term to the Einstein action. Here we provide further\ndetails as well as new results with improved numerical methods. In particular,\nwe elucidate new structure in Choptuik scaling plots. We also provide evidence\nof chaotic behavior at the transition between immediate horizon formation and\nhorizon formation after the matter pulse reflects from the AdS conformal\nboundary. Finally, we present data suggesting the formation of naked\nsingularities in spacetimes with ADM mass below the algebraic bound for black\nhole formation.\n", "  Context. Based on their overwhelming dominance among associated Fermi gamma\nray catalogue sources, it is expected that a large fraction of the unidentified\nFermi objects are blazars. Through crossmatching between the positions of\nunidentified gamma ray sources from the First Fermi Catalog of gamma ray\nsources emitting above 10 GeV (1FHL) and the ROSAT and Swift XRT catalogues of\nX ray objects and between pointed XRT observations, a sample of 36 potential\nassociations was found in previous works with less than 15 arcsec of positional\noffset. One third of them have recently been classified; the remainder, though\nbelieved to belong to the blazar class, still lack spectroscopic\nclassifications. Aims. We study the optical spectrum of the putative\ncounterparts of these unidentified gamma ray sources in order to find their\nredshifts and to determine their nature and main spectral characteristics.\nMethods. An observational campaign was carried out on the putative counterparts\nof 13 1FHL sources using medium resolution optical spectroscopy from the\nOsservatorio Astronomico di Bologna in Loiano, Italy; the Telescopio Nazionale\nGalileo and the Nordic Optical Telescope, both in the Canary Islands, Spain;\nand the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional San Pedro Martir in Baja California,\nMexico. Results. We were able to classify 14 new objects based on their\ncontinuum shapes and spectral features. Conclusions. Twelve new blazars were\nfound, along with one new quasar and one new narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) to be\npotentially associated with the 1FHL sources of our sample. Redshifts or lower\nlimits were obtained when possible alongside central black hole mass and\nluminosity estimates for the NLS1 and the quasar.\n", "  It was noticed many years ago, in the framework of massless RG flows, that\nthe irrelevant composite operator $T \\bar{T}$, built with the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, enjoys very special properties in 2D quantum field\ntheories, and can be regarded as a peculiar kind of integrable perturbation.\nNovel interesting features of this operator have recently emerged from the\nstudy of effective string theory models.In this paper we study further\nproperties of this distinguished perturbation. We discuss how it affects the\nenergy levels and one-point functions of a general 2D QFT in finite volume\nthrough a surprising relation with a simple hydrodynamic equation. In the case\nof the perturbation of CFTs, adapting a result by L\\\"uscher and Weisz we give a\ncompact expression for the partition function on a finite-length cylinder and\nmake a connection with the exact $g$-function method. We argue that, at the\nclassical level, the deformation naturally maps the action of $N$ massless free\nbosons into the Nambu-Goto action in static gauge, in $N+2$ target space\ndimensions, and we briefly discuss a possible interpretation of this result in\nthe context of effective string models.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between X-ray cooling and star formation in\nbrightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We present an X-ray spectral analysis of the\ninner regions, 10-40 kpc, of six nearby cool core clusters (z<0.35) observed\nwith Chandra ACIS. This sample is selected on the basis of the high star\nformation rate (SFR) observed in the BCGs. We restrict our search for cooling\ngas to regions that are roughly cospatial with the starburst. We fit single-\nand multi-temperature mkcflow models to constrain the amount of isobarically\ncooling intracluster medium (ICM). We find that in all clusters, below a\nthreshold temperature ranging between 0.9 and 3 keV, only upper limits can be\nobtained. In four out of six objects, the upper limits are significantly below\nthe SFR and in two, namely A1835 and A1068, they are less than a tenth of the\nSFR. Our results suggests that a number of mechanisms conspire to hide the\ncooling signature in our spectra. In a few systems the lack of a cooling\nsignature may be attributed to a relatively long delay time between the X-ray\ncooling and the star burst. However, for A1835 and A1068, where the X-ray\ncooling time is shorter than the timescale of the starburst, a possible\nexplanation is that the region where gas cools out of the X-ray phase extends\nto very large radii, likely beyond the core of these systems.\n", "  We present a method by which the degree of longitudinal variation in photonic\ncrystal fibre (PCF) may be characterised through seeded four-wave mixing (FWM).\nUsing an iterative numerical reconstruction, we created a model PCF that\ndisplays similar FWM phasematching properties across all measured length\nscales. Our results demonstrate that the structure of our PCF varies by less\nthan 1% and that the characteristic length of the variations is approximately\n15 cm.\n", "  The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are\ncoherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a\nsuppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. In this paper,\nwe continue study of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive\nsplitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections\nto standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-gluon\napproximations. In particular, this paper completes the calculation of the rate\nfor real double gluon bremsstrahlung from an initial gluon with various\nsimplifying assumptions (thick media; $\\hat q$ approximation; and large $N_c$)\nby now including processes involving 4-gluon vertices.\n", "  We quantify the dependence of the single-shot ablation threshold on the angle\nof incidence and polarization of a femtosecond laser beam, for three dissimilar\nsolid-state materials: a metal, a dielectric and a semiconductor. Using the\nconstant, linear value of the index of refraction, we calculate the laser\nfluence transmitted through the air-material interface at the point of ablation\nthreshold. We show that, in spite of the highly nonlinear ionization dynamics\ninvolved in the ablation process, the so defined transmitted threshold fluence\nis universally independent of the angle of incidence and polarization of the\nlaser beam for all three material types. We suggest that angular dependence of\nablation threshold can be utilized for profiling fluence distributions in\nultra-intense femtosecond laser beams.\n", "  We study one-dimensional anisotropic XXZ spin-$\\frac12$ model with\nferromagnetic sign of the coupling and $z-z$ exchange constant $J_z = \\Delta\nJ$, where $\\Delta < 1$, and $J$ is the coupling within XY spin plane. We\ncalculate damping of low-energy excitations with $\\omega \\ll T $ due to their\nscattering from thermal excitation bath with temperature $T \\ll J$, taking into\naccount nonzero curvature of the excitation spectrum, $\\epsilon(q) = u q +\n\\delta\\epsilon(q)$. We calculate also longitudinal spin-spin correlation\nfunction $\\langle S^z(x,t)S^z(0,0) \\rangle$ at $x \\approx ut$ and find the\nshape of the spreading \"wave packet\".\n", "  The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) has proven indispensable in\nelucidating quasiballistic heat dynamics. Experimental observations of\nnondiffusive thermal transients, however, are interpreted almost exclusively\nthrough purely diffusive formalisms that merely extract \"effective\" Fourier\nconductivities. Here, we build upon stochastic transport theory to provide a\ncharacterisation framework that blends the rich physics contained within BTE\nsolutions with the convenience of conventional analyses. The multidimensional\nphonon dynamics are described in terms of an isotropic Poissonian flight\nprocess with rigorous Fourier-Laplace single pulse response $P(\\vec{\\xi},s) =\n1/[s + \\psi(\\| \\vec{\\xi} \\|)]$. The spatial propagator $\\psi(\\|\\vec{\\xi}\\|)$,\nunlike commonly reconstructed mean free path spectra\n$\\kappa_{\\Sigma}(\\Lambda)$, serves as a genuine thermal blueprint of the medium\nthat can be identified in compact form directly from raw measurement signals.\nPractical illustrations for transient thermal grating (TTG) and time domain\nthermoreflectance (TDTR) experiments on respectively GaAs and InGaAs are\nprovided.\n", "  In this short note we organize a perturbation theory for the Bunch-Davies\nwavefunction in flat, accelerating cosmologies. The calculational technique\navoids the in-in formalism and instead uses an analytic continuation from\nEuclidean signature. We will consider both massless and conformally coupled\nself-interacting scalars. These calculations explicitly illustrate two facts.\nThe first is that IR divergences get sharper as the acceleration slows. The\nsecond is that UV-divergent contact terms in the Euclidean computation can\ncontribute to the absolute value of the wavefunction in Lorentzian signature.\nHere UV divergent refers to terms involving inverse powers of the radial cutoff\nin the Euclidean computation. In Lorentzian signature such terms encode\nphysical time dependence of the wavefunction.\n", "  The predictive accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) models of molecular\nproperties depends on the choice of the molecular representation. Based on the\npostulates of quantum mechanics, we introduce a hierarchy of representations\nwhich meet uniqueness and target similarity criteria. To systematically control\ntarget similarity, we rely on interatomic many body expansions, as implemented\nin universal force-fields, including Bonding, Angular, and higher order terms\n(BA). Addition of higher order contributions systematically increases\nsimilarity to the true potential energy and predictive accuracy of the\nresulting ML models. We report numerical evidence for the performance of BAML\nmodels trained on molecular properties pre-calculated at electron-correlated\nand density functional theory level of theory for thousands of small organic\nmolecules. Properties studied include enthalpies and free energies of\natomization, heatcapacity, zero-point vibrational energies, dipole-moment,\npolarizability, HOMO/LUMO energies and gap, ionization potential, electron\naffinity, and electronic excitations. After training, BAML predicts energies or\nelectronic properties of out-of-sample molecules with unprecedented accuracy\nand speed.\n", "  A simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) that provides an explicit\nrealization of the dark-matter (DM) neutrino-portal paradigm is presented. The\nleading interactions between the dark sector, containing scalars and relic\nfermions, and the SM involve neutrinos. This model meets all observational\nconstraints.\n", "  Cornell's electron/positron storage ring (CESR) was modified over a series of\naccelerator shutdowns beginning in May 2008, which substantially improves its\ncapability for research and development for particle accelerators. CESR's\nenergy span from 1.8 to 5.6 GeV with both electrons and positrons makes it\nappropriate for the study of a wide spectrum of accelerator physics issues and\ninstrumentation related to present light sources and future lepton damping\nrings. Additionally a number of these are also relevant for the beam physics of\nproton accelerators. This paper, the last in a series of four, describes the\nvacuum system modifications of the superconducting wigglers to accommodate the\ndiagnostic instrumentation for the study of electron cloud (EC) behavior within\nwigglers. Earlier papers provided an overview of the accelerator physics\nprogram, the general modifications of CESR, the modifications of the vacuum\nsystem necessary for the conversion of CESR to the test accelerator, CesrTA,\nenhanced to study such subjects as low emittance tuning methods, EC effects,\nintra-beam scattering, fast ion instabilities as well as general improvements\nto beam instrumentation. While the initial studies of CesrTA focussed on\nquestions related to the International Linear Collider damping ring design,\nCESR is a very versatile storage ring, capable of studying a wide range of\naccelerator physics and instrumentation questions.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations are one of the most studied and successful phenomena\nsince the establishment of the solar neutrino problem in late 1960's. In this\nwork we discuss the exact expressions for the probability P_{\\alpha\\beta} in a\nconstant density medium, in terms of the standard vacuum parameters and the\nmedium density. Besides of being compact, these expressions are independent of\nany particular parametrization, which could be helpful in the application of\nunitary tests of the mixing matrix. In addition, we introduce a new\napproximation on P_{\\alpha\\beta} and compare it with the most commonly used,\ndiscussing their main differences.\n", "  A two-level atom interacting with an electromagnetic mode in a cavity\nexperiences population collapses and revivals. They are an indirect signature\nof the field quantization, and also hold information about the mode. Thus, they\nmay be harnessed for quantum-state reconstruction. In this work, we study the\nrevival structures with the characteristic function approach. The\ncharacteristic function is essentially a spectral decomposition of the\nphoton-number probability distribution. Exploiting the characteristic function\nperiodicity, we find that the atomic population inversion can be understood as\nthe result of interference between a set of structures akin to a free\nquantum-mechanical wave packet, each structure corresponding to snapshots of\nthis packet for different degrees of dispersion. When these structures do not\noverlap, each of which can be identified to one of the inversion revivals, in\nwhich case we may also retrieve the photon-number distribution.\n", "  AE Aquarii (AE Aqr) is a cataclysmic binary hosting one of the fastest\nrotating (P$_{\\rm spin}$ = 33.08 s) white dwarfs known. Based on seven years of\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8 data, we report on a deep search for\ngamma-ray emission from AE Aqr. Using X-ray observations from ASCA, XMM-Newton,\nChandra, Swift, Suzaku, and NuSTAR, spanning 20 years, we substantially extend\nand improve the spin ephemeris of AE Aqr. Using this ephemeris, we searched for\ngamma-ray pulsations at the spin period of the white dwarf. No gamma-ray\npulsations were detected above 3 $\\sigma$ significance. Neither phase-averaged\ngamma-ray emission nor gamma-ray variability of AE Aquarii is detected by\nFermi-LAT. We impose the most restrictive upper limit to the gamma-ray flux\nfrom AE Aqr to date: $1.3\\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 100\nMeV-300 GeV energy range, providing constraints on models.\n", "  Ultrasonic experiments allow one to measure the elastic modulus of bulk solid\nor fluid samples. Recently such experiments have been carried out on\nfluid-saturated nanoporous glass to probe the modulus of a confined fluid. In\nour previous work [J. Chem. Phys., (2015) 143, 194506], using Monte Carlo\nsimulations we showed that the elastic modulus $K$ of a fluid confined in a\nmesopore is a function of the pore size. Here we focus on modulus-pressure\ndependence $K(P)$, which is linear for bulk materials, a relation known as the\nTait-Murnaghan equation. Using transition-matrix Monte Carlo simulations we\ncalculated the elastic modulus of bulk argon as a function of pressure and\nargon confined in silica mesopores as a function of Laplace pressure. Our\ncalculations show that while the elastic modulus is strongly affected by\nconfinement and temperature, the slope of the modulus versus pressure is not.\nMoreover, the calculated slope is in a good agreement with the reference data\nfor bulk argon and experimental data for confined argon derived from ultrasonic\nexperiments. We propose to use the value of the slope of $K(P)$ to estimate the\nelastic moduli of an unknown porous medium.\n", "  Because different constraints are imposed, stability conditions for\ndissipationless fluids and magnetofluids may take different forms when derived\nwithin the Lagrangian, Eulerian (energy-Casimir), or dynamical accessible\nframeworks. This is in particular the case when flows are present. These\ndifferences are explored explicitly by working out in detail two\nmagnetohydrodynamic examples: convection against gravity in a stratified fluid\nand translationally invariant perturbations of a rotating magnetized plasma\npinch. In this second example we show in explicit form how to perform the\ntime-dependent relabeling introduced in Andreussi {\\it et al.}\\ [Phys.\\ Plasmas\n{\\bf20}, 092104 (2013)] that makes it possible to reformulate Eulerian\nequilibria with flows as Lagrangian equilibria in the relabeled variables. The\nprocedures detailed in the present article provide a paradigm that can be\napplied to more general plasma configurations and in addition extended to more\ngeneral plasma descriptions where dissipation is absent.\n", "  In this paper, a recently developed Higher Order Microplane (HOM) model for\nsoftening and localization, is implemented within a isogeometric finite element\nframework. The HOM model was derived directly from a three dimensional discrete\nparticle model and it was shown to be associated with a high order continuum\ncharacterized by independent rotation and displacement fields. Furthermore, the\nHOM model possesses two characteristic lengths: the first associated with the\nspacing of flaws in the material internal structure and related to the gradient\ncharacter of the continuum; and the second associated with the size of these\nflaws and related to the micro-polar character of the continuum. The\ndisplacement-based finite element implementation of this type of continua\nrequires $C^1$ continuity both within the elements and at the element\nboundaries. This motivated the implementation of the concept of isogeometric\nanalysis which ensures a higher degree of smoothness and continuity. NURBS\nbased isogeometric elements were implemented in a 3D setting, with both\ndisplacement and rotational degrees of freedom at each control point. The\nperformed numerical analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed HOM\nmodel implementation to ensure optimal convergence in both elastic and\nsoftening regime. Furthermore, the proposed approach allows the natural\nformulation of a localization limiter able to prevent strain localization and\nspurious mesh sensitivity known to be pathological issues for typical local\nstrain-softening constitutive equations.\n", "  Kepler-20 is a solar-type star (V = 12.5) hosting a compact system of five\ntransiting planets, all packed within the orbital distance of Mercury in our\nown Solar System. A transition from rocky to gaseous planets with a planetary\ntransition radius of ~1.6 REarth has recently been proposed by several\npublications in the literature (Rogers 2015;Weiss & Marcy 2014). Kepler-20b (Rp\n~ 1.9 REarth) has a size beyond this transition radius, however previous mass\nmeasurements were not sufficiently precise to allow definite conclusions to be\ndrawn regarding its composition. We present new mass measurements of three of\nthe planets in the Kepler-20 system facilitated by 104 radial velocity\nmeasurements from the HARPS-N spectrograph and 30 archival Keck/HIRES\nobservations, as well as an updated photometric analysis of the Kepler data and\nan asteroseismic analysis of the host star (MStar = 0.948+-0.051 Msun and Rstar\n= 0.964+-0.018 Rsun). Kepler-20b is a 1.868+0.066-0.034 REarth planet in a 3.7\nday period with a mass of 9.70+1.41-1.44 MEarth resulting in a mean density of\n8.2+1.5-1.3 g/cc indicating a rocky composition with an iron to silicate ratio\nconsistent with that of the Earth. This makes Kepler-20b the most massive\nplanet with a rocky composition found to date. Furthermore, we report the\ndiscovery of an additional non-transiting planet with a minimum mass of\n19.96+3.08-3.61 MEarth and an orbital period of ~34 days in the gap between\nKepler-20f (P ~ 11 days) and Kepler-20d (P ~ 78 days).\n", "  Motivated by the recent development in strong spin-orbit-coupled materials,\nwe consider the dipole-octupole doublets on the triangular lattice. We propose\nthe most general interaction between these unusual local moments. Due to the\nspin-orbit entanglement and the special form of its wavefunction, the\ndipole-octupole doublet has a rather peculiar property under the lattice\nsymmetry operation. As a result, the interaction is highly anisotropic in the\npseudospin space, but remarkably, is uniform spatially. We analyze the ground\nstate properties of this generic model and emphasize the hidden multipolar\norders that emerge from the dipolar and octupolar interactions. We clarify the\nquantum mutual modulations between the dipolar and octupolar orders. We predict\nthe experimental consequences of the multipolar orders and propose the\nrare-earth triangular materials as candidate systems for these unusual\nproperties.\n", "  Recent spectrum-sharing research has produced a strategy to address spectrum\nscarcity problems. This novel idea, named cognitive radio, considers that\nsecondary users can opportunistically exploit spectrum holes left temporarily\nunused by primary users. This presents a competitive scenario among cognitive\nusers, making it suitable for game theory treatment. In this work, we show that\nthe spectrum-sharing benefits of cognitive radio can be increased by designing\na medium access control based on quantum game theory. In this context, we\npropose a model to manage spectrum fairly and effectively, based on a\nmultiple-users multiple-choice quantum minority game. By taking advantage of\nquantum entanglement and quantum interference, it is possible to reduce the\nprobability of collision problems commonly associated with classic algorithms.\nCollision avoidance is an essential property for classic and quantum\ncommunications systems. In our model, two different scenarios are considered,\nto meet the requirements of different user strategies. The first considers\nsensor networks where the rational use of energy is a cornerstone; the second\nfocuses on installations where the quality of service of the entire network is\na priority.\n", "  We study the ergodic properties of excited states in a model of interacting\nfermions in quasi-one-dimensional chains subjected to a random vector\npotential. In the noninteracting limit, we show that arbitrarily small values\nof this complex off-diagonal disorder trigger localization for the whole\nspectrum; the divergence of the localization length in the single-particle\nbasis is characterized by a critical exponent $\\nu$ which depends on the energy\ndensity being investigated. When short-range interactions are included, the\nlocalization is lost, and the system is ergodic regardless of the magnitude of\ndisorder in finite chains. Our numerical results suggest a delocalization\nscheme for arbitrary small values of interactions. This finding indicates that\nthe standard scenario of the many-body localization cannot be obtained in a\nmodel with random gauge fields.\n", "  In the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE), we compute the\n$\\gamma^*\\gamma\\to\\pi^0$ transition form factor, $G(Q^2)$. For the first time,\nin a continuum approach to quantun chromodynamics (QCD), it was possible to\ncompute $G(Q^2)$ on the whole domain of space-like momenta. Our result agrees\nwith CELLO, CLEO and Belle collaborations and, with the well-known asymptotic\nQCD limit, $2f_\\pi$. Our analysis unifies this prediction with that of the\npion's valence-quark parton distribution amplitude (PDA) and elastic\nelectromagnetic form factor.\n", "  We present a new approach to engineering broadband sources of entangled\nphoton pairs for quantum interferometry. The source is based on\nquasi-phase-matched spontaneous parametric down conversion in a titanium\ndiffused periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide with a strongly-chirped\npoling period. The proposed non-standard asymmetric poling mitigates phase\ndistortions associated with the process of chirping. Asymmetric poling\nsignificantly broadens the entangled source bandwidth while preserving high\nvisibility quantum interferometric sensing.\n", "  The newly detected Earth-mass planet in the habitable zone of Proxima\nCentauri could potentially host life - if it has an atmosphere that supports\nsurface liquid water. We show that thermal phase curve observations with the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) from 5-12 microns can be used to test the\nexistence of such an atmosphere. We predict the thermal variation for a bare\nrock versus a planet with 35% heat redistribution to the nightside and show\nthat a JWST phase curve measurement can distinguish between these cases at\n$4\\sigma$ confidence, assuming photon-limited precision. We also consider the\ncase of an Earth-like atmosphere, and find that the ozone 9.8 micron band could\nbe detected with longer integration times (a few months). We conclude that JWST\nobservations have the potential to put the first constraints on the possibility\nof life around the nearest star to the Solar System.\n", "  The story-line of the activities that have produced the first group of\nscientists in Mexico working on particle accelerator science and technology is\nbriefly presented.\n", "  Parity-violating elastic electron-nucleon scattering at low momentum transfer\nallows one to access the nucleon's weak charge, the vector coupling of the\n$Z$-boson to the nucleon. In the Standard Model and at tree level, the weak\ncharge of the proton is related to the weak mixing angle and accidentally\nsuppressed, $Q_W^{p,\\,{\\rm tree}}=1-4\\sin^2\\theta_W\\approx0.07$. Modern\nexperiments aim at extracting $Q_W^p$ at $\\sim1\\%$ accuracy. Similarly, parity\nnon-conservation in atoms allows to access the weak charge of atomic nuclei. We\nconsider a novel class of radiative corrections, an exchange of two photons\nwith parity violation in the hadronic/nuclear system. These corrections may\naffect the extraction of $\\sin^2\\theta_W$ from the experimental data at the\nrelevant level of precision because they are affected by long-range\ninteractions similar to other parity-violating radiative corrections, such as,\ne.g., the $\\gamma Z$-exchange, which has obtained much attention recently. We\nshow that the significance of this new correction increases with the beam\nenergy in parity-violating electron scattering, but the general properties of\nthe parity-violating forward Compton amplitude protect the formal definition of\nthe weak charge as a limit at zero-momentum transfer and zero-energy. We also\ndiscuss the relevance of the new correction for upcoming experiments.\n", "  We use the recent measurement of the isotropic $\\gamma$-ray background (IGRB)\nby Fermi LAT and analysis of the contribution of unresolved point $\\gamma$-ray\nsources to IGRB to build constraints on the models of ultra-high cosmic rays\n(UHECR) origin. We also calculate the minimal expected diffuse $\\gamma$-ray\nflux produced by UHECR interactions with an interstellar photon background.\nFinally, for the subclass of dark matter (DM) models with decaying weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMP), we build constraints on the particle\ndecay time using minimal expected contributions to the IGRB from unresolved\npoint $\\gamma$-ray sources and UHECR.\n", "  We provide a set of tools for analyzing the geometry of elliptically fibered\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, starting with a description of the total space rather\nthan with a Weierstrass model or a specified type of fiber/base. Such an\napproach to the subject of F-theory compactification makes certain geometric\nproperties, which are usually hidden, manifest. Specifically, we review how to\nisolate genus-one fibrations in such geometries and then describe how to find\ntheir sections explicitly. This includes a full parameterization of the\nMordell-Weil group where non-trivial. We then describe how to analyze the\nassociated Weierstrass models, Jacobians and resolved geometries. We illustrate\nour discussion with concrete examples which are complete intersections in\nproducts of projective spaces (CICYs). The examples presented include cases\nexhibiting non-abelian symmetries and higher rank Mordell-Weil group. We also\nmake some comments on non-flat fibrations in this context. In a companion paper\n[1] to this one, these results will be used to analyze the consequences for\nstring dualities of the ubiquity of multiple fibrations in known constructions\nof Calabi-Yau manifolds.\n", "  In this work we explore the physics associated to Calabi-Yau (CY) n-folds\nthat can be described as a fibration in more than one way. Beginning with\nF-theory vacua in various dimensions, we consider limits/dualities with\nM-theory, type IIA, and heterotic string theories. Our results include many\nM-/F-theory correspondences in which distinct F-theory vacua - associated to\ndifferent elliptic fibrations of the same CY n-fold - give rise to the same\nM-theory limit in one dimension lower. Examples include 5-dimensional\ncorrespondences between 6-dimensional theories with Abelian, non-Abelian and\nsuperconformal structure, as well as examples of higher rank Mordell-Weil\ngeometries. In addition, in the context of heterotic/F-theory duality, we\ninvestigate the role played by multiple K3- and elliptic fibrations in known\nand novel string dualities in 8-, 6- and 4-dimensional theories. Here we\nsystematically summarize nested fibration structures and comment on the roles\nthey play in T-duality, mirror symmetry, and 4-dimensional compactifications of\nF-theory with G-flux. This investigation of duality structures is made possible\nby geometric tools developed in a companion paper [1].\n", "  An unusual Fe-H bonding rather than conventional OH bonding is identified at\nFe3O4 (001) surface. This abnormal behavior is associated with the oxygen\nvacancies which exist on the surface region but also penetrate deep into the\nbulk Fe3O4. In contrast, OH bonding becomes preferential as generally expected\non an ozone processed surface, which has appreciably less oxygen vacancies.\nSuch bonding site selective behavior, depending on oxygen vacancy\nconcentrations, is further confirmed with DFT calculations. The results\ndemonstrate an opportunity for tuning the chemical properties of oxide surfaces\nor oxide clusters.\n", "  We present a quark-diquark model for the nucleons where the light front wave\nfunctions are constructed from the soft-wall AdS/QCD prediction. The model is\nconsistent with quark counting rule and Drell-Yan-West relation. The model\nreproduces the scale evolution of unpolarized PDF of proton for a wide range of\nenergy scale. Helicity and transversity distributions for the proton predicted\nin this model agree with phenomenological fits. The axial and tensor charges\nare also shown to agree with the experimental data. The model can be used to\nevaluate distributions like GPDS, TMDs etc. and their scale evolutions.\n", "  The E1 transitions of $\\psi(3686)$ and $\\psi(3770)\\to \\gamma\\chi_{cJ}$ are\ninvestigated in a non-relativistic effective field theory (NREFT) where the\nopen charm effects are included systematically as the leading corrections. It\nalso allows a self-consistent inclusion of the $S$-$D$ mixing in the same\nframework. We are able to show that the open charm contributions are essential\nfor understanding the significant discrepancies between the non-relativistic\nleading order calculations and the experimental data.\n", "  We develop an exact Green-Kubo formula relating nonequilibrium averages in\nsystems of interacting active Brownian particles to equilibrium\ntime-correlation functions. The method is applied to calculate the\ndensity-dependent average swim speed, which is a key quantity entering coarse\ngrained theories of active matter. The average swim speed is determined by\nintegrating the equilibrium autocorrelation function of the interaction force\nacting on a tagged particle. Analytical results are validated using Brownian\ndynamics simulations.\n", "  We observe a dramatic difference in optical line shapes of a $^4\\text{He}$\nBose-Einstein condensate and a $^3\\text{He}$ degenerate Fermi gas by measuring\nthe 1557-nm $2~^3S-2~^1S$ magnetic dipole transition ($8~\\text{Hz}$ natural\nlinewidth) in an optical dipole trap. The $15~\\text{kHz}$ FWHM condensate line\nshape is only broadened by mean field interactions, whereas the degenerate\nFermi gas line shape is broadened to $75~\\text{kHz}$ FWHM due to the effect of\nPauli exclusion on the spatial and momentum distributions. The asymmetric\noptical line shapes are observed in excellent agreement with line shape models\nfor the quantum degenerate gases. For $^4$He a triplet-singlet s-wave\nscattering length $a=+50(10)_{\\text{stat}}(43)_{\\text{syst}}~a_0$ is extracted.\nThe high spectral resolution reveals a doublet in the absorption spectrum of\nthe BEC, and this effect is understood by the presence of a weak optical\nlattice in which a degeneracy of the lattice recoil and the spectroscopy photon\nrecoil leads to Bragg-like scattering.\n", "  We present the results of a search for new circumstellar disks around\nlow-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types >K5 that are confirmed or\ncandidate members of nearby young moving groups. Our search input sample was\ndrawn from the BANYAN surveys of Malo et al. and Gagn\\'e et al. Two-Micron\nAll-Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer data were used to detect\nnear- to mid-infrared excesses that would reveal the presence of circumstellar\ndisks. A total of 13 targets with convincing excesses were identified: four are\nnew and nine were already known in the literature. The new candidates are 2MASS\nJ05010082$-$4337102 (M4.5), J08561384$-$1342242 (M8$\\,\\gamma$),\nJ12474428$-$3816464 (M9$\\,\\gamma$) and J02265658$-$5327032 (L0$\\,\\delta$), and\nare candidate members of the TW Hya ($\\sim10\\pm 3\\,$Myr), Columba ($\\sim\n42^{+6}_{-4}\\,$Myr) and Tucana-Horologium ($\\sim 45\\pm 4\\,$Myr) associations,\nwith masses of $120$ and $13-18\\,M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$. The M8$-$L0 objects in\nColumba and Tucana-Horologium are potentially among the first substellar disk\nsystems aged $\\sim 40\\,$Myr. Estimates of the new candidates' mean disk\ntemperatures and fractional luminosities are in the ranges $\\sim 135-520\\,$K\nand $0.021-0.15$, respectively. New optical spectroscopy of J0501$-$4337\nreveals strong H$\\alpha$ emission, possibly indicating ongoing accretion,\nprovides a detection of lithium absorption and a radial velocity measurement\nthat is consistent with a membership to Columba. We also present a\nnear-infrared spectrum of J0226$-$5327 that reveals Paschen $\\beta$ emission\nand shows signs of low surface gravity, consistent with accretion from a disk\nand a young age.\n", "  Confinement has been suggested as a tool to tune the self-assembly properties\nof nanoparticles, surfactants, polymers and colloids. In this way, we explore\nthe phase diagram of Janus nanoparticles using Molecular Dynamics simulations.\nThe nanoparticle was modeled as a dimer made by one monomer that interacts by a\nstandard Lennard Jones potential and another monomer that is modeled using a\ntwo-length scale shoulder potential. This specific design of nanoparticle\nexhibits in bulk distinct self-assembled structures and water-like diffusion\nanomaly. Our results indicate that besides the aggregates observed in bulk, new\nstructures are observed under confinement. Also, the dynamic and thermodynamic\nbehavior of the fluid phase are affected. The systems show a reentrant fluid\nphase and density anomaly. None of these two features were observed in bulk.\nOur results show that geometrical confinement leads to new structural,\nthermodynamical and dynamical behavior for this Janus nanoparticle.\n", "  We investigate bright fluorescence of nitrogen (NV)- and silicon-vacancy\ncolor centers in pyramidal, single crystal diamond tips which are commercially\navailable as atomic force microscope probes. We coherently manipulate NV\nelectronic spin ensembles with $T_2 = 7.7(3)\\,\\mu$s. Color center lifetimes in\ndifferent tip heights indicate effective refractive index effects and\nquenching. Using numerical simulations, we verify enhanced photon rates from\nemitters close to the pyramid apex; a situation promising for scanning probe\nsensing.\n", "  We propose a short- and long-range corrected (SLC) hybrid scheme employing\n100% Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange at both zero and infinite interelectronic\ndistances, wherein three SLC hybrid density functionals with the D3 dispersion\ncorrections (SLC-LDA-D3, SLC-PBE-D3, and SLC-B97-D3) are developed. SLC-PBE-D3\nand SLC-B97-D3 are shown to be accurate for a very diverse range of\napplications, such as core ionization and excitation energies, thermochemistry,\nkinetics, noncovalent interactions, dissociation of symmetric radical cations,\nvertical ionization potentials, vertical electron affinities, fundamental gaps,\nand valence, Rydberg, and long-range charge-transfer excitation energies.\nRelative to omegaB97X-D, SLC-B97-D3 provides significant improvement for core\nionization and excitation energies and noticeable improvement for the\nself-interaction, asymptote, energy-gap, and charge-transfer problems, while\nperforming similarly for thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent\ninteractions.\n", "  We present the convergence study of a recurrence entanglement purification\nprotocol using arbitrary two-qubit initial states. The protocol is based on a\nrank two projector in the Bell basis which serves as a two-qubit operation\nreplacing the usual controlled-NOT gate. We show that the whole space of\ntwo-qubit density matrices is mapped onto an invariant subspace characterized\nby seven real parameters. By analyzing this type of density matrices we are\nable to find general conditions for entanglement purification in the form of\ntwo inequalities between pairs of diagonal elements and pairs of coherences. We\nshow that purifiable initial states do not necessary require a fidelity larger\nthan one half with respect to any maximally entangled pure state. Furthermore,\nwe find a family of states parametrized by their concurrence that can be\nperfectly converted into a Bell state in just one step of the protocol with\nprobability proportional to the square of the concurrence.\n", "  The search of the \"hidden sector\" via new neutral light bosons Z-dark\n($Z_{d}$) could be revealed by the study of the decay of the discovered\nHiggs-like boson or any other undiscovered Higgs boson. After the LHC concluded\na successful first period of running, the ATLAS Collaboration published its\nlatest results on the $H\\rightarrow Z_{d}Z_{d}\\rightarrow 4l$ analysis using up\nto 20 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. In this\nproceeding I present a summary of the recent results on the search of the\n$Z_{d}$ in the signature $H\\rightarrow Z_{d}Z_{d}\\rightarrow 4l$ with the ATLAS\ndetector at the LHC.\n", "  We report the direct imaging detection of a low-mass companion to a young,\nmoderately active star V450 And, that was previously identified with the radial\nvelocity method. The companion was found in high-contrast images obtained with\nthe Subaru Telescope equipped with the HiCIAO camera and AO188 adaptive optics\nsystem. From the public ELODIE and SOPHIE archives we extracted available\nhigh-resolution spectra and radial velocity (RV) measurements, along with RVs\nfrom the Lick planet search program. We combined our multi-epoch astrometry\nwith these archival, partially unpublished RVs, and found that the companion is\na low-mass star, not a brown dwarf, as previously suggested. We found the\nbest-fitting dynamical masses to be $m_1=1.141_{-0.091}^{+0.037}$ and\n$m_2=0.279^{+0.023}_{-0.020}$ M$_\\odot$. We also performed spectral analysis of\nthe SOPHIE spectra with the iSpec code. The Hipparcos time-series photometry\nshows a periodicity of $P=5.743$ d, which is also seen in SOPHIE spectra as an\nRV modulation of the star A. We interpret it as being caused by spots on the\nstellar surface, and the star to be rotating with the given period. From the\nrotation and level of activity, we found that the system is $380^{+220}_{-100}$\nMyr old, consistent with an isochrone analysis ($220^{+2120}_{-90}$ Myr). This\nwork may serve as a test case for future studies of low-mass stars, brown\ndwarfs and exoplanets by combination of RV and direct imaging data.\n", "  The Higgs-inflaton coupling plays an important role in the Higgs field\ndynamics in the early Universe. Even a tiny coupling generated at loop level\ncan have a dramatic effect on the fate of the electroweak vacuum. Such\nHiggs-inflaton interaction is present both at the trilinear and quartic levels\nin realistic reheating models. In this work, we examine the Higgs dynamics\nduring the preheating epoch, focusing on the effects of the parametric and\ntachyonic resonances. We use lattice simulations and other numerical tools in\nour studies. We find that the resonances can induce large fluctuations of the\nHiggs field which destabilize the electroweak vacuum. Our considerations thus\nprovide an upper bound on quartic and trilinear interactions between the Higgs\nand the inflaton. We conclude that there exists a favourable range of the\ncouplings within which the Higgs field is stabilized during both inflation and\npreheating epochs.\n", "  The hadron-quark phase transition in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) has the\npotential to trigger explosions in otherwise nonexploding models. However,\nthose hybrid supernova equations of state (EOS) shown to trigger an explosion\ndo not support the observational 2 M$_\\odot$ neutron star maximum mass\nconstraint. In this work, we analyze cold hybrid stars by the means of a\nsystematic parameter scan for the phase transition properties, with the aim to\ndevelop a new hybrid supernova EOS. The hadronic phase is described with the\nstate-of-the-art supernova EOS HS(DD2), and quark matter by an EOS with a\nconstant speed of sound (CSS) of $c_{QM}^2=1/3$. We find promising cases which\nmeet the 2 M$_\\odot$ criterion and are interesting for CCSN explosions. We show\nthat the very simple CSS EOS is transferable into the well-known thermodynamic\nbag model, important for future application in CCSN simulations. In the second\npart, the occurrence of reconfinement and multiple phase transitions is\ndiscussed. In the last part, the influence of hyperons in our parameter scan is\nstudied. Including hyperons no change in the general behavior is found, except\nfor overall lower maximum masses. In both cases (with and without hyperons) we\nfind that quark matter with $c_{QM}^2=1/3$ can increase the maximum mass only\nif reconfinement is suppressed or if quark matter is absolutely stable.\n", "  Much of the physical world around us can be described in terms of harmonic\noscillators in thermodynamic equilibrium. At the same time, the far from\nequilibrium behavior of oscillators is important in many aspects of modern\nphysics. Here, we investigate a resonating system subject to a fundamental\ninterplay between intrinsic nonlinearities and a combination of several driving\nforces. We have constructed a controllable and robust realization of such a\nsystem using a macroscopic doubly clamped string. We experimentally observe a\nhitherto unseen double hysteresis in both the amplitude and the phase of the\nresonator's response function and present a theoretical model that is in\nexcellent agreement with the experiment. Our work provides a thorough\nunderstanding of the double-hysteretic response through a symmetry breaking of\nparametric phase states that elucidates the selection criteria governing\ntransitions between stable solutions. Our study motivates applications ranging\nfrom ultrasensitive force detection to low-energy computing memory units.\n", "  The quantum harmonic oscillator with parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry,\nobtained from the ordinary (Hermitian) quantum harmonic oscillator by an\nimaginary displacement of the spatial coordinate, provides an important and\nexactly-solvable model to investigate non-Hermitian extension of the Ehrenfest\ntheorem. Here it is shown that transverse light dynamics in an optical\nresonator with off-axis longitudinal pumping can emulate a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum harmonic oscillator, providing an\nexperimentally accessible system to investigate non-Hermitian coherent state\npropagation.\n", "  In this work, with focus on the energy transport properties in quantum, low\ndimensional, graded materials, we address the investigation of the energy (and\nspin) current in XXZ open chains with graded inner structures and driven out of\nequilibrium by magnetization pumping applied at the ends. We study several\ntypes of graded structures in different situations in order to show a\nubiquitous occurrence of energy rectification, even for the system under a\nhomogeneous magnetic field. Due to technical difficulties, we carry out the\ncomputation for small chains, but we present arguments which indicate the\nextension of some results to larger systems. Recalling the generic existence of\nenergy rectification in classical, graded materials, which are described by\nanharmonic chains of oscillators, and recalling also the anharmonicity of these\nXXZ models, which involve quartic terms in more transparent representation in\nterms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators, we may say that our\nresults extend the ubiquity of energy rectification occurrence in classical\ngraded materials to the case of quantum systems.\n", "  We introduce a simplified version of the steady-state ab initio laser theory\nfor calculating the effects of mode competition in continuous wave lasers using\nthe passive cavity resonances. This new theory harnesses widely available\nnumerical methods that can efficiently calculate the passive cavity resonances,\nwith negligible additional computational overhead. Using this theory, we\ndemonstrate that the pump profile of the laser cavity can be optimized both for\nhighly multi-mode and single-mode emission. An open source implementation of\nthis method has been made available.\n", "  To examine the electronic phase diagram of superconducting CuO double chains,\nwe report the effect of external pressure on the magneto-transport properties\nin superconducting and non-superconducting polycrystalline samples of\nPr$_{2}$Ba$_{4}$Cu$_{7}$O$_{15-\\delta }$ at low temperatures (1.8-40 K) under\nvarious magnetic fields (up to 14 T). In the as-sintered non-superconducting\nsample, the magneto-resistance (MR) follows a power law of $H^{3/2}$ at low\ntemperatures, which is in no agreement with the $H^{2}$ dependence of MR in the\nPrBa$_{2}$Cu$_{4}$O$_{8}$ system. The negative pressure dependence of the\nsuperconducting phase is qualitatively consistent with a theoretical prediction\non the basis of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid theory. The 48-h-reduced\nsuperconducting sample at ambient pressure exhibits no clear increase in MR for\n$T > T_{c,on}=26.5$ K. In contrast, with the application of pressure to the\nsuperconducting sample, the MR effects reappear and are also well fitted by\n$H^{3/2}$. The model of slightly warped Fermi surfaces explains not only the MR\neffect of the non-superconducting sample, but is also related to the reasons\nfor the pressure-induced MR phenomena of the superconducting sample.\n", "  We show that the highly frustrated transverse-field Ising model on the\nthree-dimensional pyrochlore lattice realizes a first-order phase transition\nwithout symmetry breaking between the low-field Coulomb quantum spin liquid and\nthe high-field polarized phase. The quantum phase transition is located\nquantitively by comparing low- and high-field series expansions. Furthermore,\nthe intriguing properties of the elementary excitations in the polarized phase\nare investigated. We argue that this model can be achieved experimentally by\napplying mechanical strain to a classical spin ice material comprised of\nnon-Kramers spins such as Ho_2Ti_2O_7. Taken together with our results, this\nprovides a new experimental platform to study quantum spin liquid physics.\n", "  We introduce a new kind of non-relativistic ${\\cal N}{=}\\,8$ supersymmetric\nmechanics, associated with worldline realizations of the supergroup $SU(2|2)$\ntreated as a deformation of flat ${\\cal N}{=}\\,8$, $d{=}1$ supersymmetry.\nVarious worldline $SU(2|2)$ superspaces are constructed as coset manifolds of\nthis supergroup, and the corresponding superfield techniques are developed. For\nthe off-shell $SU(2|2)$ multiplets $({\\bf 3,8,5})$, $({\\bf 4,8,4})$ and $({\\bf\n5,8,3})$, we construct and analyze the most general superfield and component\nactions. Common features are mass oscillator-type terms proportional to the\ndeformation parameter and a trigonometric realization of the superconformal\ngroup $OSp(4^*|4)$ in the conformal cases. For the simplest $({\\bf 5, 8, 3})$\nmodel the quantization is performed.\n", "  We study the star formation quenching mechanism in cluster galaxies by\nfitting the SED of the Herschel Reference Survey, a complete volume-limited\nK-band-selected sample of nearby galaxies including objects in different\ndensity regions, from the core of the Virgo cluster to the general field. The\nSED are fitted using the CIGALE SED modelling code. The truncated activity of\ncluster galaxies is parametrised using a specific SFH with 2 free parameters,\nthe quenching age QA and the quenching factor QF. These 2 parameters are\ncrucial for the identification of the quenching mechanism which acts on long\ntimescales if starvation while rapid and efficient if ram pressure. To be\nsensitive to an abrupt and recent variation of the star formation activity, we\ncombine in a new way 20 UV to FIR photometric bands with 3 age-sensitive Balmer\nline absorption indices extracted from available medium-resolution integrated\nspectroscopy and with Halpha narrow band imaging data. The use of a truncated\nSFH significantly increases the quality of the fit in those objects whose\natomic gas content has been removed during the interaction with the hostile\ncluster environment. The typical QA of the perturbed late-type galaxies is QA <\n300 Myr whenever the activity of star formation is reduced by 50% < QF <= 80%\nand QA < 500 Myr for QF > 80%, while that of the quiescent early-types is QA ~\n1-3 Gyr. The fraction of late-types with a star formation activity reduced by\nQF > 80% and with an HI-deficiency parameter HI-def > 0.4 drops by a factor of\n~ 5 from the inner half virial radius of the Virgo cluster, where the hot\ndiffuse X-ray emitting gas of the cluster is located, to the outer regions. The\nefficient quenching of the star formation activity observed in Virgo suggests\nthat the dominant stripping process is ram pressure. We discuss the implication\nof this result in the cosmological context of galaxy evolution.\n", "  The distribution of the sunspot group size (area) and its dependence on the\nlevel of solar activity is studied. It is shown that the fraction of small\ngroups is not constant but decreases with the level of solar activity so that\nhigh solar activity is largely defined by big groups. We study the possible\ninfluence of solar activity on the ability of a realistic observer to see and\nreport the daily number of sunspot groups. It is shown that the relation\nbetween the number of sunspot groups as seen by different observers with\ndifferent observational acuity thresholds is strongly non-linear and cannot be\napproximated by the traditionally used linear scaling ($k-$factors). The\nobservational acuity threshold [$A_{\\rm th}$] is considered to quantify the\nquality of each observer, instead of the traditional relative $k-$factor. A\nnonlinear $c-$factor based on $A_{\\rm th}$ is proposed, which can be used to\ncorrect each observer to the reference conditions. The method is tested on a\npair of principal solar observers, Wolf and Wolfer, and it is shown that the\ntraditional linear correction, with the constant $k-$factor of 1.66 to scale\nWolf to Wolfer, leads to an overestimate of solar activity around solar maxima.\n", "  We propose a $PT$-symmetrically deformed version of the graphene\ntight-binding model under a magnetic field. We analyze the structure of the\nspectra and the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonians around the $K$ and $K'$\npoints, both in the $PT$-symmetric and $PT$-broken regions. In particular we\nshow that the presence of the deformation parameter $V$ produces several\ninteresting consequences, including the asymmetry of the zero-energy states of\nthe Hamiltonians and the breakdown of the completeness of the eigenvector sets.\nWe also discuss the biorthogonality of the eigenvectors, which {turns out to\nbe} different in the $PT$-symmetric and $PT$-broken regions.\n", "  In this paper, we study the holographic descriptions of the conformal block\nof heavy operators in two-dimensional large c conformal field theory. We\nconsider the case that the operators are pairwise inserted such that the\ndistance between the operators in a pair is much smaller than the others. In\nthis case, each pair of heavy operators creates a conical defect in the bulk.\nWe propose that the conformal block is dual to the on-shell action of three\ndimensional geometry with conical defects in the semi-classical limit. We show\nthat the variation of the on-shell action with respect to the conical angle is\nequal to the length of the corresponding conical defect. We derive this\ndifferential relation on the conformal block in the field theory by introducing\ntwo extra light operators as both the probe and the perturbation. Our study\nalso suggests that the area law of the holographic Renyi entropy must holds for\na large class of states generated by a finite number of heavy operators\ninsertion.\n", "  Electronic interactions present in material compositions close to the\nsuperconducting dome play a key role in the manifestation of high-Tc\nsuperconductivity. In many correlated electron systems, however, the parent or\nunderdoped states exhibit strongly inhomogeneous electronic landscape at the\nnanoscale that may be associated with competing, coexisting, or intertwined\nchemical disorder, strain, magnetic, and structural order parameters. Here we\ndemonstrate an approach based on a combination of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) and advanced statistical learning for an\nautomatic separation and extraction of statistically significant electronic\nbehaviors in the spin density wave (SDW) regime of a lightly (~1%) gold-doped\nBaFe2As2. We show that the decomposed STS spectral features have a direct\nrelevance to fundamental physical properties of the system, such as SDW-induced\ngap, pseudogap-like state, and impurity resonance states.\n", "  The link between changes in the material crystal structure and its\nmechanical, electronic, magnetic, and optical functionalities - known as the\nstructure-property relationship - is the cornerstone of the contemporary\nmaterials science research. The recent advances in scanning transmission\nelectron and scanning probe microscopies (STEM and SPM) have opened an\nunprecedented path towards examining the materials structure-property\nrelationships on the single-impurity and atomic-configuration levels. Lacking,\nhowever, are the statistics-based approaches for cross-correlation of structure\nand property variables obtained in different information channels of the STEM\nand SPM experiments. Here we have designed an approach based on a combination\nof sliding window fast Fourier transform, Pearson correlation matrix, and\nlinear and kernel canonical correlation, to study a relationship between\nlattice distortions and electron scattering from SPM data on graphene with\ndefects. Our analysis revealed that the strength of coupling to strain is\naltered between different scattering channels, which can explain coexistence of\nseveral quasiparticle interference patterns in nanoscale regions of interest.\nIn addition, the application of kernel functions allowed us to extract a\nnon-linear component of the relationship between the lattice strain and\nscattering intensity in graphene. The outlined approach can be further utilized\ntowards analyzing correlations in various multi-modal imaging techniques where\nthe information of interest is spatially distributed and generally has a\ncomplex multidimensional nature.\n", "  An algorithm is used to generate new solutions of the scalar field equations\nin homogeneous and isotropic universes. Solutions can be found for pure scalar\nfields with various potentials in the absence and presence of spatial curvature\nand other perfect fluids. A series of generalisations of the Chaplygin gas and\nbulk viscous cosmological solutions for inflationary universes are found.\nFurthermore other closed-form solutions which provide inflationary universes\nare presented. We also show how the Hubble slow-roll parameters can be\ncalculated using the solution algorithm and we compare these inflationary\nsolutions with the observational data provided by the Planck 2015 collaboration\nin order to constraint and rule out some of these models.\n", "  The chameleon model is a scalar field theory with a screening mechanism that\nexplains how a cosmologically relevant light scalar can avoid the constraints\nof intra-solar-system searches for fifth-forces. The chameleon is a popular\ndark energy candidate and also arises in $f(R)$ theories of gravity. Whilst the\nchameleon is designed to avoid historical searches for fifth-forces it is not\nunobservable and much effort has gone into identifying the best observables and\nexperiments to detect it. These results are not always presented for the same\nmodels or in the same language, a particular problem when comparing\nastrophysical and laboratory searches making it difficult to understand what\nregions of parameter space remain. Here we present combined constraints on the\nchameleon model from astrophysical and laboratory searches for the first time\nand identify the remaining windows of parameter space. We discuss the\nimplications for cosmological chameleon searches and future small-scale probes.\n", "  Lindsay 1 is an intermediate age (approx 8 Gyr) massive cluster in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). Using VLT FORS2 spectra of 16 probable cluster members\non the lower RGB of the cluster, we measure CN and CH band strengths (at 3883\nand 4300 Angstroms respectively), along with carbon and nitrogen abundances and\nfind that a sub-population of stars has significant nitrogen enrichment. A lack\nof spread in carbon abundances excludes evolutionary mixing as the source of\nthis enrichment, so we conclude that this is evidence of multiple populations.\nTherefore, L1 is the youngest cluster to show such variations, implying that\nthe process triggering the onset of multiple populations must operate until at\nleast redshift ~1.\n", "  In the context of remnant CP transformations, I briefly discuss a generalized\n$\\mu-\\tau$ reflection symmetry, where the \"Majorana\" phases have CP conserving\nvalues, which are directly related with the CP parities of neutrino states.\nAlso, one finds that the \"Dirac-like\" CP violation phase is correlated with the\natmospheric mixing angle, giving important phenomenological implications for\ncurrent and future long baseline oscillation neutrino experiments.\n", "  Using Molecular Dynamics approach we investigated the structure, dynamics of\nwater confined inside pristine and charged 6,6 carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This\nstudy reports the breakdown of 1D water wires and the emergence of triangular\nfaced water on incorporating charges in 6,6 CNTs. Incorporation of charges\nresults in high potential barriers to the flipping of water molecules due to\nthe formation of a large number of hydrogen bonds. The PMF analyses show the\npresence of ~2 kcal/mol barrier for the movement of water inside pristine CNT\nand almost negligible barrier in charged CNTs.\n", "  We present a constructive algorithm for the determination of Ryu-Takayanagi\nsurfaces in AdS3/CFT2 which exploits previously noted connections between\nholographic entanglement entropy and max-flow/min-cut. We then characterize its\ncomplexity as a polynomial time algorithm.\n", "  Quantal diffusion mechanism of nucleon exchange is studied in the central\ncollisions of several symmetric heavy-ion collisions in the framework of the\nStochastic Mean-Field (SMF) approach. Since at bombarding energies below the\nfusion barrier, di-nuclear structure is maintained, it is possible to describe\nnucleon exchange as a diffusion process familiar from deep-inelastic\ncollisions. Quantal diffusion coefficients, including memory effects, for\nproton and neutron exchanges are extracted microscopically employing the SMF\napproach. The quantal calculations of neutron and proton variances are compared\nwith the semi-classical results.\n", "  In this work we explore a lepton flavor violation effect induced at one loop\nfor a flavor structure in an extended minimal standard supersymmetric model,\nconsidering an ansatz for the trilinear term. In particular we find a finite\nexpression which will show the impact of this phenomena in the $h\\to \\mu \\tau$\ndecay, produced by a mixing in the trilinear coupling of the soft\nsupersymmetric Lagrangian.\n", "  The ability to tailor the energy distribution of plasmons at the nanoscale\nhas many applications in nanophotonics, such as designing plasmon lasers,\nspasers, and quantum emitters. To this end, we analytically study the energy\ndistribution and the proper field quantization of 2D plasmons with specific\nexamples for graphene plasmons. We find that the portion of the plasmon energy\ncontained inside graphene (energy confinement factor) can exceed 50%, despite\ngraphene being infinitely thin. In fact, this very high energy confinement can\nmake it challenging to tailor the energy distribution of graphene plasmons just\nby modifying the surrounding dielectric environment or the geometry, such as\nchanging the separation distance between two coupled graphene layers. However,\nby adopting concepts of parity-time symmetry breaking, we show that tuning the\nloss in one of the two coupled graphene layers can simultaneously tailor the\nenergy confinement factor and propagation characteristics, causing the\nphenomenon of loss-induced plasmonic transparency.\n", "  We study the dependence of kHz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) frequency on\naccretion-related parameters in the ensemble of neutron star low-mass X-ray\nbinaries. Based on the mass accretion rate, $\\dot{M}$, and the magnetic field\nstrength, $B$, on the surface of the neutron star, we find a correlation\nbetween the lower kHz QPO frequency and $\\dot{M}/B^{2}$. The correlation holds\nin the current ensemble of Z and atoll sources and therefore can explain the\nlack of correlation between the kHz QPO frequency and X-ray luminosity in the\nsame ensemble. The average run of lower kHz QPO frequencies throughout the\ncorrelation can be described by a power-law fit to source data. The simple\npower-law, however, cannot describe the frequency distribution in an individual\nsource. The model function fit to frequency data, on the other hand, can\naccount for the observed distribution of lower kHz QPO frequencies in the case\nof individual sources as well as the ensemble of sources. The model function\ndepends on the basic length scales such as the magnetospheric radius and the\nradial width of the boundary region, both of which are expected to vary with\n$\\dot{M}$ to determine the QPO frequencies. In addition to modifying the length\nscales and hence the QPO frequencies, the variation in $\\dot{M}$, being\nsufficiently large, may also lead to distinct accretion regimes, which would be\ncharacterized by Z and atoll phases.\n", "  We report preliminary results of the complementary experimental and numerical\nstudies on spatiotemporal tangle development and streamwise vortex line density\n(VLD) distribution in counterflowing $^4$He. The experiment is set up in a long\nsquare channel with VLD and local temperature measured in three streamwise\nlocations. In the steady state we observe nearly streamwise-homogeneous VLD.\nExperimental second sound data as well as numerical data (vortex filament\nmethod in a long planar channel starting with seeding vortices localized in\nmultiple locations) show that the initial build up pattern of VLD displays\ncomplex features depending on the position in the channel, but the some tangle\nproperties appear uniform along its length.\n", "  We used ultra-deep $J$ and $K_s$ images secured with the near-infrared GSAOI\ncamera assisted by the multi-conjugate adaptive optics system GeMS at the\nGEMINI South Telescope in Chile, to obtain a ($K_s$, $J-K_s$) color-magnitude\ndiagram (CMD) for the bulge globular cluster NGC 6624. We obtained the deepest\nand most accurate near-infrared CMD from the ground for this cluster, by\nreaching $K_s$ $\\sim$ 21.5, approximately 8 magnitudes below the horizontal\nbranch level. The entire extension of the Main Sequence (MS) is nicely sampled\nand at $K_s$ $\\sim$ 20 we detected the so-called MS \"knee\" in a purely\nnear-infrared CMD. By taking advantage of the exquisite quality of the data, we\nestimated the absolute age of NGC 6624 ($t_{age}$ = 12.0 $\\pm$ 0.5 Gyr), which\nturns out to be in good agreement with previous studies in the literature. We\nalso analyzed the luminosity and mass functions of MS stars down to M $\\sim$\n0.45 M$_{\\odot}$ finding evidence of a significant increase of low-mass stars\nat increasing distances from the cluster center. This is a clear signature of\nmass segregation, confirming that NGC 6624 is in an advanced stage of dynamical\nevolution.\n", "  Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection in rotating spherical shells can be considered\nas a simplified analogue of many astrophysical and geophysical fluid flows.\nHere, we use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to study this\nphysical process. We construct a dataset of more than 200 numerical models that\ncover a broad parameter range with Ekman numbers spanning $3\\times 10^{-7} \\leq\nE \\leq 10^{-1}$, Rayleigh numbers within the range $10^3 < Ra < 2\\times\n10^{10}$ and a Prandtl number unity. We investigate the scaling behaviours of\nboth local (length scales, boundary layers) and global (Nusselt and Reynolds\nnumbers) properties across various physical regimes from onset of rotating\nconvection to weakly-rotating convection. Close to critical, the convective\nflow is dominated by a triple force balance between viscosity, Coriolis force\nand buoyancy. For larger supercriticalities, a subset of our numerical data\napproaches the asymptotic diffusivity-free scaling of rotating convection\n$Nu\\sim Ra^{3/2}E^{2}$ in a narrow fraction of the parameter space delimited by\n$6\\,Ra_c \\leq Ra \\leq 0.4\\,E^{-8/5}$. Using a decomposition of the viscous\ndissipation rate into bulk and boundary layer contributions, we establish a\ntheoretical scaling of the flow velocity that accurately describes the\nnumerical data. In rapidly-rotating turbulent convection, the fluid bulk is\ncontrolled by a triple force balance between Coriolis, inertia and buoyancy,\nwhile the remaining fraction of the dissipation can be attributed to the\nviscous friction in the Ekman layers. Beyond $Ra \\simeq E^{-8/5}$, the\nrotational constraint on the convective flow is gradually lost and the flow\nproperties vary to match the regime changes between rotation-dominated and\nnon-rotating convection. The quantity $Ra E^{12/7}$ provides an accurate\ntransition parameter to separate rotating and non-rotating convection.\n", "  We report a combined study for the electronic structures of ferromagnetic\nCeAgSb$_2$ using soft X-ray absorption (XAS), magnetic circular dichroism\n(XMCD), and angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) spectroscopies. The Ce $M_{4,\n5}$ XAS spectra show very small satellite structures, reflecting a strongly\nlocalized character of the Ce $4f$ electrons. The linear dichroism effects in\nthe Ce $M_{4, 5}$ XAS spectra demonstrate the ground state Ce $4f$ symmetry of\n$\\Gamma{_6}$, the spatial distribution of which is directed along the $c$-axis.\nThe XMCD results give support to the picture of local-moment magnetism in\nCeAgSb$_2$. Moreover it is also found that the theoretical band dispersions for\nLaAgSb$_2$ provides better description of the ARPES band structures than those\nfor CeAgSb$_2$. Nevertheless, ARPES spectra at the Ce $3d$-$4f$ resonance show\nthe momentum dependence for the intensity ratio between Ce $4f^{1}_{5/2}$ and\n$4f^{1}_{7/2}$ peaks in a part of the Brillouin zone, suggesting the\nnon-negligible momentum dependent hybridization effect between the Ce $4f$ and\nthe conduction electrons. This is associated with the moderate mass enhancement\nin CeAgSb$_2$.\n", "  Detection of periodicity in the broad-band non-thermal emission of blazars\nhas so far been proven to be elusive. However, there are a number of scenarios\nwhich could lead to quasi-periodic variations in blazar light curves. For\nexample, orbital or thermal/viscous period of accreting matter around central\nsupermassive black holes could, in principle, be imprinted in the\nmulti-wavelength emission of small-scale blazar jets, carrying as such crucial\ninformation about plasma conditions within the jet launching regions. In this\npaper, we present the results of our time series analysis of $\\sim 9.2$\nyear-long, and exceptionally well-sampled optical light curve of the BL Lac OJ\n287. The study primarily uses the data from our own observations performed at\nthe Mt. Suhora and Krak\\'ow Observatories in Poland, and at the Athens\nObservatory in Greece. Additionally, SMARTS observations were used to fill in\nsome of the gaps in the data. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram and the Weighted\nWavelet Z-transform methods were employed to search for the possible QPOs in\nthe resulting optical light curve of the source. Both the methods consistently\nyielded possible quasi-periodic signal around the periods of $\\sim 400$ and\n$\\sim 800$ days, the former one with a significance (over the underlying\ncolored noise) of $\\geq 99\\%$. A number of likely explanations for such are\ndiscussed, with a preference given to a modulation of the jet production\nefficiency by highly magnetized accretion disks. This supports the previous\nfindings and the interpretation reported recently in the literature for OJ 287\nand other blazar sources.\n", "  In this review, we present a new method for computing physical cross sections\nat NLO accuracy in QCD without using the standard Dimensional Regularisation.\nThe algorithm is based on the Loop-Tree Duality theorem, which allow us to\nobtain loop integrals as a sum of phase-space integrals; in this way,\ntransforming loop integrals into phase-space integrals, we propose a method to\nmerge virtual and real contributions in order to find observables at NLO in\n$d=4$ space-time dimensions. In addition, the strategy described is used for\ncomputing the $\\gamma^*\\to q\\bar{q}(g)$ process. A more detailed discussion\nrelated on this topic can be found in Ref [1].\n", "  In this review, we discuss the results on the parton-to-pion fragmentation\nfunctions obtained in a combined NLO fit to data of single-inclusive hadron\nproduction in electron-positron annihilation, proton-proton collisions, and\nlepton-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering. A more complete discussion can be\nfound in Ref. [1].\n", "  Interactions between jets and the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion\ncollisions are studied via the angular distributions of summed charged-particle\ntransverse momenta (pt) with respect to both the leading and subleading jet\naxes in high-pt dijet events. The contributions of charged particles in\ndifferent momentum ranges to the overall event pt balance are decomposed into\nshort-range jet peaks and a long-range azimuthal asymmetry in charged-particle\npt. The results for PbPb collisions are compared to those in pp collisions\nusing data collected in 2011 and 2013, at collision energy sqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76\nTeV with integrated luminosities of 166 inverse microbarns and 5.3 inverse\npicobarns, respectively, by the CMS experiment at the LHC. Measurements are\npresented as functions of PbPb collision centrality, charged-particle pt,\nrelative azimuth, and radial distance from the jet axis for balanced and\nunbalanced dijets.\n", "  The phenomenon of stochastic growth of a surface on a two-dimensional\nsubstrate occurs in Nature in a variety of circumstances and its statistical\ncharacterization requires the study of higher order cumulants. Here, we\nconsider the statistical cumulants of height fluctuations governed by the\n$(2+1)$-dimensional KPZ equation for flat geometry. We follow a diagrammatic\nscheme to derive the expressions for renormalized cumulants up to fourth order\nin the stationary state. Assuming a value for the roughness exponent from\nreliable numerical predictions, we calculate the second, third and fourth\ncumulants, yielding skewness $S=0.2879$ and kurtosis $Q=0.1995$. These values\nagree well with the available numerical estimations.\n", "  We present the measurement of the projected and redshift space 2-point\ncorrelation function (2pcf) of the new catalog of Chandra COSMOS-Legacy AGN at\n2.9$\\leq$z$\\leq$5.5 ($\\langle L_{bol} \\rangle \\sim$10$^{46}$ erg/s) using the\ngeneralized clustering estimator based on phot-z probability distribution\nfunctions (Pdfs) in addition to any available spec-z. We model the projected\n2pcf estimated using $\\pi_{max}$ = 200 h$^{-1}$ Mpc with the 2-halo term and we\nderive a bias at z$\\sim$3.4 equal to b = 6.6$^{+0.60}_{-0.55}$, which\ncorresponds to a typical mass of the hosting halos of log M$_h$ =\n12.83$^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$. A similar bias is derived using\nthe redshift-space 2pcf, modelled including the typical phot-z error $\\sigma_z$\n= 0.052 of our sample at z$\\geq$2.9. Once we integrate the projected 2pcf up to\n$\\pi_{max}$ = 200 h$^{-1}$ Mpc, the bias of XMM and \\textit{Chandra} COSMOS at\nz=2.8 used in Allevato et al. (2014) is consistent with our results at higher\nredshift. The results suggest only a slight increase of the bias factor of\nCOSMOS AGN at z$\\gtrsim$3 with the typical hosting halo mass of moderate\nluminosity AGN almost constant with redshift and equal to logM$_h$ =\n12.92$^{+0.13}_{-0.18}$ at z=2.8 and log M$_h$ = 12.83$^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ at\nz$\\sim$3.4, respectively. The observed redshift evolution of the bias of COSMOS\nAGN implies that moderate luminosity AGN still inhabit group-sized halos at\nz$\\gtrsim$3, but slightly less massive than observed in different independent\nstudies using X-ray AGN at z$\\leq2$.\n", "  We apply photo-dissociation region (PDR) molecular line emission models, that\nhave varying degrees of enhanced mechanical heating rates, to the gaseous\ncomponent of simulations of star-forming galaxies taken from the literature.\nSnapshots of these simulations are used to produce line emission maps for the\nrotational transitions of the CO molecule and its 13CO isotope up to J = 4-3.\n  We consider two galaxy models: a small disk galaxy of solar metallicity and a\nlighter dwarf galaxy with 0.2 \\zsun metallicity. Elevated excitation\ntemperatures for CO(1 - 0) correlate positively with mechanical feedback, that\nis enhanced towards the central region of both model galaxies. The emission\nmaps of these model galaxies are used to compute line ratios of CO and 13CO\ntransitions. These line ratios are used as diagnostics where we attempt to\nmatch them These line ratios are used as diagnostics where we attempt to match\nthem to mechanically heated single component (i.e. uniform density, Far-UV\nflux, visual extinction and velocity gradient) equilibrium PDR models.\n  We find that PDRs ignoring mechanical feedback in the heating budget\nover-estimate the gas density by a factor of 100 and the far-UV flux by factors\nof ~10 - 1000. In contrast, PDRs that take mechanical feedback into account are\nable to fit all the line ratios for the central < 2 kpc of the fiducial disk\ngalaxy quite well. The mean mechanical heating rate per H atom that we recover\nfrom the line ratio fits of this region varies between $10^{-27}$ --\n$10^{-26}$~erg s$^{-1}$.\n", "  Far-infrared molecular emission is an important tool used to understand the\nexcitation mechanisms of the gas in the inter-stellar medium of star-forming\ngalaxies. In the present work, we model the emission from rotational\ntransitions with critical densities n >~ 10^4 cm-3. We include 4-3 < J <= 15-14\ntransitions of CO and 13CO, in addition to J <= 7-6 transitions of HCN, HNC,\nand HCO+ on galactic scales. We do this by re-sampling high density gas in a\nhydrodynamic model of a gas-rich disk galaxy, assuming that the density field\nof the interstellar medium of the model galaxy follows the probability density\nfunction (PDF) inferred from the resolved low density scales. We find that in a\nnarrow gas density PDF, with a mean density of ~10 cm-3 and a dispersion \\sigma\n= 2.1 in the log of the density, most of the emission of molecular lines,\nemanates from the 10-1000 cm-3 part of the PDF. We construct synthetic emission\nmaps for the central 2 kpc of the galaxy and fit the line ratios of CO and 13CO\nup to J = 15-14, as well as HCN, HNC, and HCO+ up to J = 7-6, using one\nphoto-dissociation region (PDR) model. We attribute the goodness of the one\ncomponent fits for our model galaxy to the fact that the distribution of the\nluminosity, as a function of density, is peaked at gas densities between 10 and\n1000 cm-3.\n  We explore the impact of different log-normal density PDFs on the\ndistribution of the line-luminosity as a function of density, and we show that\nit is necessary to have a broad dispersion, corresponding to Mach numbers >~ 30\nin order to obtain significant emission from n > 10^4 cm-3 gas. Such Mach\nnumbers are expected in star-forming galaxies, LIRGS, and ULIRGS. By fitting\nline ratios of HCN(1-0), HNC(1-0), and HCO+(1-0) for a sample of LIRGS and\nULIRGS using mechanically heated PDRs, we constrain the Mach number of these\ngalaxies to 29 < M < 77.\n", "  In the talk the leading four-loop contribution to the beta-function of the\nstrong coupling in the SM is discussed. Some details of calculation techniques\nare provided. Special attention is paid to the ambiguity due to utilized\n$\\gamma_5$ treatment and a particular prescription with anticommuting\n$\\gamma_5$ is advocated. As a by-product of our computation the four-loop\nbeta-function in QCD with \"gluino\" is also obtained.\n", "  We propose to use the flux variability of lensed quasar images induced by\ngravitational microlensing to measure the transverse peculiar velocity of lens\ngalaxies over a wide range of redshift. Microlensing variability is caused by\nthe motions of the observer, the lens galaxy (including the motion of the stars\nwithin the galaxy), and the source; hence, its frequency is directly related to\nthe galaxy's transverse peculiar velocity. The idea is to count time-event\nrates (e.g., peak or caustic crossing rates) in the observed microlensing light\ncurves of lensed quasars that can be compared with model predictions for\ndifferent values of the transverse peculiar velocity. To compensate for the\nlarge time-scale of microlensing variability we propose to count and model the\nnumber of events in an ensemble of gravitational lenses. We develop the\nmethodology to achieve this goal and apply it to an ensemble of 17 lensed\nquasar systems. In spite of the shortcomings of the available data, we have\nobtained tentative estimates of the peculiar velocity dispersion of lens\ngalaxies at $z\\sim 0.5$, $\\sigma_{\\rm\npec}(0.53\\pm0.18)\\simeq(638\\pm213)\\sqrt{\\langle m \\rangle/0.3 M_\\odot} \\, \\rm\nkm\\, s^{-1}$. Scaling at zero redshift we derive, $\\sigma_{\\rm\npec}(0)\\simeq(491\\pm164) \\sqrt{\\langle m \\rangle/0.3 M_\\odot} \\, \\rm km\\,\ns^{-1}$, consistent with peculiar motions of nearby galaxies and with recent\n$N$-body nonlinear reconstructions of the Local Universe based on $\\Lambda$CDM.\nWe analyze the different sources of uncertainty of the method and find that for\nthe present ensemble of 17 lensed systems the error is dominated by Poissonian\nnoise, but that for larger ensembles the impact of the uncertainty on the\naverage stellar mass may be significant.\n", "  Motivated by the significant interaction of convection, rotation and magnetic\nfield in many astrophysical objects, we investigate the interplay between\nlarge-scale flows driven by rotating convection and an imposed magnetic field.\nWe utilise a simple model in two dimensions comprised of a plane layer that is\nrotating about an axis inclined to gravity. It is known that this setup can\nresult in strong mean flows; we numerically examine the effect of an imposed\nhorizontal magnetic field on such flows. We show that increasing the field\nstrength in general suppresses the time-dependent mean flows, but in some cases\nit organises them leading to stronger time-averaged flows. Further, we discuss\nthe effect of the field on the correlations responsible for driving the flows\nand the competition between Reynolds and Maxwell stresses. A change in\nbehaviour is observed when the (fluid and magnetic) Prandtl numbers are\ndecreased. In the smaller Prandtl number regime, it is shown that significant\nmean flows can persist even when the quenching of the overall flow velocity by\nthe field is relatively strong.\n", "  Leo Kadanoff has worked in many fields of statistical mechanics. His\ncontributions had an enormous impact. This holds in particular for critical\nphenomena, where he explained Widom's homogeneity laws by means of block-spin\ntransformations and laid the basis for Wilson's renormalization group equation.\nI had the pleasure to work in his group for one year. A short historically\naccount is given.\n", "  Excited states in neutron-rich nuclei located south-east of $^{132}$Sn are\ninvestigated by shell-model calculations. A new shell-model Hamiltonian is\nconstructed for the present study. The proton-proton and neutron-neutron\ninteractions of the Hamiltonian are obtained through the existing CD-Bonn $G$\nmatrix results, while the proton-neutron interaction across two major shells is\nderived from the monopole based universal interaction plus the M3Y spin-orbit\nforce. The present Hamiltonian can reproduce well the experimental data\navailable in this region, including one-neutron separation energies, level\nenergies and the experimental $B(E2)$ values of isomers in $^{134,136,138}$Sn,\n$^{130}$Cd, and $^{128}$Pd. New isomers are predicted in this region, $e.g.$ in\n$^{135}$Sn, $^{131}$Cd, $^{129}$Pd, $^{132,134}$In and $^{130}$Ag, in which\nalmost no excited states are known experimentally yet. In the odd-odd\n$^{132,134}$In and $^{130}$Ag, the predicted very long $E2$ life-times of the\nlow-lying $5^{-}$ states are discussed, demanding more information on the\nrelated proton-neutron interaction. The low-lying states of $^{132}$In are\ndiscussed in connection with the recently observed $\\gamma$ rays. The predicted\n$19/2^{-}$ isomer in $^{129}$Pd could decay by both electromagnetic transitions\nand neutron emission with comparable partial life-times, making it a good\ncandidate for neutron radioactivity, a decay mode which is yet to be\ndiscovered.\n", "  Why does the Sun shine? Today we know the answer to the question and we also\nknow that earlier answers were quite wrong. The problem of the source of solar\nenergy became an important part of physics and astronomy only with the\nemergence of the law of energy conservation in the 1840s. The first theory of\nsolar heat based on the new law, due to J. R. Mayer, assumed the heat to be the\nresult of meteors or asteroids falling into the Sun. A different and more\nsuccessful version of gravitation-to-heat energy conversion was proposed by H.\nHelmholtz in 1854 and further developed by W. Thomson. For more than forty\nyears the once so celebrated Helmholtz-Thomson contraction theory was accepted\nas the standard theory of solar heat despite its prediction of an age of the\nSun of only 20 million years. In between the gradual demise of this theory and\nthe radically different one based on nuclear processes there was a period in\nwhich radioactivity was considered a possible alternative to gravitational\ncontraction. The essay discusses various pre-nuclear ideas of solar energy\nproduction, including the broader relevance of the question as it was conceived\nin the Victorian era.\n", "  We present the first detailed chemical abundance study of the ultra-faint\ndwarf galaxy Tucana II based on high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra of four\nred giant stars. The metallicity of these stars ranges from [Fe/H] = -3.2 to\n-2.6, and all stars are low in neutron-capture abundances ([Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe]\n< -1). However, a number of anomalous chemical signatures are present. Three\nstars are carbon-enhanced, including the most metal-rich star. This star\n([Fe/H]=-2.6) shows [Na,$\\alpha$,Sc/Fe] < 0, suggesting an extended star\nformation history with contributions from AGB stars and Type Ia supernovae. The\nother carbon-enhanced stars have [Fe/H] < -3 and may be consistent with\nenrichment by faint supernovae, if such supernovae can produce neutron-capture\nelements. A fourth star with [Fe/H] = -3 is carbon-normal, and exhibits\ndistinct light element abundance ratios from the carbon-enhanced stars. The\ncarbon-normal star implies that at least two distinct nucleosynthesis sources,\nboth possibly associated with Population III stars, contributed to the early\nchemical enrichment of this galaxy. Despite its very low luminosity, Tucana II\nshows a diversity of chemical signatures that preclude it from being a simple\n\"one-shot\" first galaxy, but still provide a window to star and galaxy\nformation in the early universe.\n", "  The composition of a planet's atmosphere is determined by its formation,\nevolution, and present-day insolation. A planet's spectrum therefore may hold\nclues on its origins. We present a \"chain\" of models, linking the formation of\na planet to its observable present-day spectrum. The chain links include (1)\nthe planet's formation and migration, (2) its long-term thermodynamic\nevolution, (3) a variety of disk chemistry models, (4) a non-gray atmospheric\nmodel, and (5) a radiometric model to obtain simulated spectroscopic\nobservations with JWST and ARIEL. In our standard chemistry model the inner\ndisk is depleted in refractory carbon as in the Solar System and in white\ndwarfs polluted by extrasolar planetesimals. Our main findings are: (1)\nEnvelope enrichment by planetesimal impacts during formation dominates the\nfinal planetary atmospheric composition of hot Jupiters. We investigate two,\nunder this finding, prototypical formation pathways: a formation inside or\noutside the water iceline, called \"dry\" and \"wet\" planets, respectively. (2)\nBoth the \"dry\" and \"wet\" planets are oxygen-rich (C/O<1) due to the oxygen-rich\nnature of the solid building blocks. The \"dry\" planet's C/O ratio is <0.2 for\nstandard carbon depletion, while the \"wet\" planet has typical C/O values\nbetween 0.1 and 0.5 depending mainly on the clathrate formation efficiency.\nOnly non-standard disk chemistries without carbon depletion lead to carbon-rich\nC/O ratios >1 for the \"dry\" planet. (3) While we consistently find C/O ratios\n<1, they still vary significantly. To link a formation history to a specific\nC/O, a better understanding of the disk chemistry is thus needed.\n", "  Multi-band touchings such as 3-band, 6-band and 8-band touchings together\nwith the emergence of high pseudospin fermions were predicted recently at\nhigh-symmetry points in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple cubic model whose unit cell contains three atoms. There are 6 bands in\nthe system due to the spin degrees of freedom. The 4-band and 2-band touchings\nare realized at high-symmetry points, where we derive low-energy theories,\ndemonstrating the emergence of pseudospin-3/2 fermions and Weyl fermions,\nrespectively. Away from the high-symmetry points, we find critical Weyl\nfermions present exactly at the boundary between the type-I and type-II Weyl\nfermions. This critical Weyl fermion transforms into the type-I or type-II Weyl\nfermion once the magnetic field is applied.\n", "  In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C3.1\ncircular-ribbon flare SOL2015-10-16T10:20 in AR 12434. The flare consisted of a\ncircular flare ribbon (CFR), an inner flare ribbon (IFR) inside, and a pair of\nshort parallel flare ribbons (PFRs). During the impulsive phase of the flare,\n\"two-step\" raster observations of \\textit{IRIS} with a cadence of 6 s and an\nexposure time of 2 s show plasma downflow at the CFR in the Si {\\sc iv}\n$\\lambda$1402.77 line, suggesting chromospheric condensation. The downflow\nspeeds first increased rapidly from a few km s$^{-1}$ to the peak values of\n45$-$52 km s$^{-1}$, before decreasing gradually to the initial levels. The\ndecay timescales of condensation were 3$-$4 minutes, indicating ongoing\nmagnetic reconnection. Interestingly, the downflow speeds are positively\ncorrelated with logarithm of the Si {\\sc iv} line intensity and time derivative\nof the \\textit{GOES} soft X-ray (SXR) flux in 1$-$8 {\\AA}. The radio dynamic\nspectra are characterized by a type \\Rmnum{3} radio burst associated with the\nflare, which implies that the chromospheric condensation was most probably\ndriven by nonthermal electrons. Using an analytical expression and the peak\nDoppler velocity, we derived the lower limit of energy flux of the\nprecipitating electrons, i.e., 0.65$\\times$10$^{10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.\nThe Si {\\sc iv} line intensity and SXR derivative show quasi-periodic\npulsations with periods of 32$-$42 s.\n", "  We establish the existence and find the necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a new class of solutions of Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes that\nhave non vanishing rotation and spatial twist simultaneously. We transparently\nshow that the existence of such solutions demand non vanishing and bounded heat\nflux and these solutions are self similar. We provide a brief algorithm\nindicating how to solve the system of field equations with the given Cauchy\ndata on an initial spacelike Cauchy surface. Finally we argue that these\nsolutions can be used as a first approximation from spherical symmetry to study\nrotating, inhomogeneous, dynamic and radiating astrophysical stars.\n", "  We carry out a study of the exterior of an axially and reflection symmetric\nsource of gravitational radiation. The exterior of such a source is filled with\na null fluid produced by the dissipative processes inherent to the emission of\ngravitational radiation, thereby representing a generalization of the Vaidya\nmetric for axially and reflection symmetric spacetimes. The role of the\nvorticity, and its relationship with the presence of gravitational radiation is\nput in evidence. The spherically symmetric case (Vaidya) is, asymptotically,\nrecovered within the context of the $1+3$ formalism.\n", "  Treating dark matter at large scales as an effectively viscous fluid provides\nan improved framework for the calculation of the density and velocity power\nspectra compared to the standard assumption of an ideal pressureless fluid. We\ndiscuss how this framework can be made concrete through an appropriate\ncoarse-graining procedure. We also review results that demonstrate that it\nimproves the convergence of cosmological perturbation theory.\n", "  It has been conjectured that the speed of sound in holographic models with UV\nfixed points has an upper bound set by the value of the quantity in conformal\nfield theory. If true, this would set stringent constraints for the presence of\nstrongly coupled quark matter in the cores of physical neutron stars, as the\nexistence of two-solar-mass stars appears to demand a very stiff Equation of\nState. In this article, we present a family of counterexamples to the speed of\nsound conjecture, consisting of strongly coupled theories at finite density.\nThe theories we consider include ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at finite\nR-charge density and non-zero gaugino masses, while the holographic duals are\nEinstein-Maxwell theories with a minimally coupled scalar in a charged black\nhole geometry. We show that for a small breaking of conformal invariance, the\nspeed of sound approaches the conformal value from above at large chemical\npotentials.\n", "  Massive stars are key players in the evolution of galaxies, yet their\nformation pathway remains unclear. In this work, we use data from several\ngalaxy-wide surveys to build an unbiased dataset of ~700 massive young stellar\nobjects (MYSOs), ~200 giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and ~100 young (<10 Myr)\noptical stellar clusters (SCs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We employ this\ndata to quantitatively study the location and clustering of massive star\nformation and its relation to the internal structure of GMCs. We reveal that\nmassive stars do not typically form at the highest column densities nor centers\nof their parent GMCs at the ~6 pc resolution of our observations. Massive star\nformation clusters over multiple generations and on size scales much smaller\nthan the size of the parent GMC. We find that massive star formation is\nsignificantly boosted in clouds near SCs. Yet, whether a cloud is associated\nwith a SC does not depend on either the cloud's mass or global surface density.\nThese results reveal a connection between different generations of massive\nstars on timescales up to 10 Myr. We compare our work with Galactic studies and\ndiscuss our findings in terms of GMC collapse, triggered star formation, and a\npotential dichotomy between low- and high-mass star formation.\n", "  Galaxy mergers are important events that can determine the fate of a galaxy\nby changing its morphology, star-formation activity and mass growth. Merger\nsystems have commonly been identified from their disturbed morphologies, and we\nnow can employ Integral Field Spectroscopy to detect and analyze the impact of\nmergers on stellar kinematics as well. We visually classified galaxy morphology\nusing deep images ($\\mu_{\\rm r} = 28\\,\\rm mag\\,\\, arcsec^{-2}$) taken by the\nBlanco 4-m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. In this\npaper we investigate 63 bright ($M_{\\rm r}<-19.3$) spectroscopically-selected\ngalaxies in Abell 119; of which 53 are early type and 20 galaxies show a\ndisturbed morphology by visual inspection. A misalignment between the major\naxes in the photometric image and the kinematic map is conspicuous in\nmorphologically-disturbed galaxies. Our sample is dominated by early-type\ngalaxies, yet it shows a surprisingly tight Tully-Fisher relation except for\nthe morphologically-disturbed galaxies which show large deviations. Three out\nof the eight slow rotators in our sample are morphology disturbed. The\nvisually-selected morphologically-disturbed galaxies are generally more\nasymmetric, visually as well as kinematically. Our findings suggest that galaxy\ninteractions, including mergers and perhaps fly-bys, play an important role in\ndetermining the orientation and magnitude of galaxy's angular momentum.\n", "  We first calculate the jet quenching parameter of an anisotropic plasma with\na U(1) chemical potential via the AdS/CFT duality. The effects of charge,\nanisotropy parameter and quark motion direction on the jet quenching parameter\nare investigated. We then discuss the situation of anisotropic black brane in\nthe IR region. We study both the jet quenching parameters along the\nlongitudinal direction and transverse plane.\n", "  We reformulate gauge theories in analogy with the vierbein formalism of\ngeneral relativity. More specifically, we reformulate gauge theories such that\ntheir gauge dynamical degrees of freedom are local fields that transform\nlinearly under the dual representation of the charged matter field. These local\nfields, which naively have the interpretation of non-local operators similar to\nWilson lines, satisfy constraint equations. A set of basis tensor fields are\nused to solve these constraint equations, and their field theory is\nconstructed. A new local symmetry in terms of the basis tensor fields is used\nto make this field theory local and maintain a Hamiltonian that is bounded from\nbelow. The field theory of the basis tensor fields is what we call the basis\ntensor gauge theory.\n", "  Most models identify the X-ray bright North Polar Spur (NPS) with a hot\ninterstellar (IS) bubble in the Sco-Cen star-forming region at $\\simeq$130 pc.\nAn opposite view considers the NPS as a distant structure associated with\nGalactic nuclear outflows. Constraints on the NPS distance can be obtained by\ncomparing the foreground IS gas column inferred from X-ray absorption to the\ndistribution of gas and dust along the line of sight. Absorbing columns towards\nshadowing molecular clouds simultaneously constrain the CO-H$_{2}$ conversion\nfactor. We derived the columns of X-ray absorbing matter NH(abs) from spectral\nfitting of dedicated XMM-Newton observations towards the NPS southern terminus\n(l=29{\\deg}, b=+5 to +11{\\deg}). The IS matter distribution was obtained from\nabsorption lines in stellar spectra, 3D dust maps and emission data, including\nhigh spatial resolution CO measurements recorded for this purpose. NH(abs)\nvaries from $\\simeq$ 4.3 to $\\simeq$ 1.3 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ along the 19\nfields. Relationships between X-ray brightness, absorbing column and hardness\nratio demonstrate a brightness decrease with latitude governed by increasing\nabsorption. The comparison with absorption data, local and large-scale dust\nmaps rules out a NPS near side closer than 300 pc. The correlation between\nNH(abs) and the reddening increases with the sightline length from 300 pc to 4\nkpc and is the tightest with Planck $\\tau_{353}$-based reddening, suggesting a\nmuch larger distance. N(H)/E(B-V) $\\simeq$ 4.1 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$\nmag$^{-1}$. NH(abs) absolute values are compatible with HI-CO clouds at -5\n$\\leq$ V(LSR) $\\leq$ +25 to +45 km s$^{-1}$ and a NPS potentially far beyond\nthe Local Arm. A molecular cloud shadow at b=+9deg constrains X$_{CO}$ to\n$\\leq$ 1.0 x 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s. The average X$_{CO}$ is\n$\\leq$ 0.75 x 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ km$^{-1}$ s.\n", "  For general dimension $d$ we prove the equidistribution of energy at the\nmicro-scale in $\\mathbb R^d$, for the optimal point configurations appearing in\nCoulomb gases at zero temperature. At the microscopic scale, i.e. after blow-up\nat the scale corresponding to the interparticle distance, in the case of\nCoulomb gases we show that the energy concentration is precisely determined by\nthe macroscopic density of points, independently of the scale. This uses the\n\"jellium energy\" which was previously shown to control the next-order term in\nthe large particle number asymptotics of the minimum energy. As a corollary, we\nobtain sharp error bounds on the discrepancy between the number of points and\nits expected average of optimal point configurations for Coulomb gases,\nextending previous results valid only for $2$-dimensional log-gases. For Riesz\ngases with interaction potentials $g(x)=|x|^{-s}, s\\in]\\min\\{0,d-2\\},d[$ and\none-dimensional log-gases, we prove the same equidistribution result under an\nextra hypothesis on the decay of the localized energy, which we conjecture to\nhold for minimizing configurations. In this case we use the\nCaffarelli-Silvestre description of the non-local fractional Laplacians in\n$\\mathbb R^d$ to localize the problem.\n", "  In this paper relativistic-invariant phenomenological Lagrangians of\ninteraction between spin-1 particles and electromagnetic field were obtained in\nthe Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism on the basis of the covariant model that\ntakes into account both spin polarizabilities and gyrations of the\nabove-mentioned particles. It was shown that in the suggested covariant model\nwith regard to the crossing symmetry, spatial parity and gauge invariance\nconservation laws, definite spin polarizabilities and gyrations of spin-1\nparticles contribute to the expansion of Compton scattering amplitude, starting\nfrom the corresponding orders on energy of pfotons that is in the agreement\nwith low-energy theorems for that process.\n", "  We present optical longslit observations of the complete sample of 71 Type 2\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs) with double-peaked narrow emission lines at $z <\n0.1$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Double-peaked emission lines are produced\nby a variety of mechanisms including disk rotation, kpc-scale dual AGNs, and\nNLR kinematics (outflows or inflows). We develop a novel kinematic\nclassification technique to determine the nature of these objects using\nlongslit spectroscopy alone. We determine that 86% of the double-peaked\nprofiles are produced by moderate luminosity AGN outflows, 6% are produced by\nrotation, and 8% are ambiguous. While we are unable to directly identify dual\nAGNs with longslit data alone, we explore their potential kinematic\nclassifications with this method. We also find a positive correlation between\nthe narrow-line region (NLR) size and luminosity of the AGN NLRs\n(R$_{\\mathrm{NLR}}\\propto \\; {\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{[OIII]}}}^{0.21 \\pm 0.05}$),\nindicating a clumpy two-zone ionization model for the NLR.\n", "  Much progress in the theory of positron scattering on atoms has been made in\nthe ten years since the review of Surko, Gribakin and Buckman [J. Phys. B 38,\nR57 (2005)]. We review this progress for few-electron targets with a particular\nemphasis on the two-centre convergent close-coupling and other theories which\nexplicitly treat positronium (Ps) formation. While substantial progress has\nbeen made for Ps formation in positron scattering on few-electron targets,\nconsiderable theoretical development is still required for multielectron atomic\nand molecular targets.\n", "  We have investigated the photo-stability of pristine and super-hydrogenated\npyrene cations C$_{16}$H$_{10+m}^+, m = 0,6, \\mathrm{\\ or\\ } 16$) by means of\ngas-phase action spectroscopy. Optical absorption spectra and photo-induced\ndissociation mass spectra are presented. By measuring the yield of\nmass-selected photo-fragment ions as a function of laser pulse intensity, the\nnumber of photons (and hence the energy) needed for fragmentation of the carbon\nbackbone was determined. Backbone fragmentation of pristine pyrene ions\n(C$_{16}$H$_{10}^+$) requires absorption of three photons of energy just below\n3 eV, whereas super-hydrogenated hexahydropyrene (C$_{16}$H$_{16}^+$) must\nabsorb two such photons and fully hydrogenated hexadecahydropyrene\n(C$_{16}$H$_{26}^+$) only a single photon. These results are consistent with\npreviously reported dissociation energies for these ions. Our experiments\nclearly demonstrate that the increased heat capacity from the additional\nhydrogen atoms does not compensate for the weakening of the carbon backbone\nwhen pyrene is hydrogenated. In photodissociation regions, super-hydrogenated\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been proposed to serve as\ncatalysts for H$_2$-formation. Our results indicate that carbon backbone\nfragmentation may be a serious competitor to H$_2$-formation at least for small\nhydrogenated PAHs like pyrene.\n", "  We construct a world-sheet action for Green-Schwarz superstring in terms of\ndoubled-yet-gauged spacetime coordinates. For an arbitrarily curved NS-NS\nbackground, the action possesses $\\mathbf{O}(10,10)$ T-duality,\n$\\mathbf{Spin}(1,9)\\times\\mathbf{Spin}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry, coordinate gauge\nsymmetry, spacetime doubled-yet-gauged diffeomorphisms, world-sheet\ndiffeomorphisms and Weyl symmetry. Further, restricted to flat backgrounds, it\nenjoys maximal spacetime supersymmetry and kappa-symmetry. After the auxiliary\ncoordinate gauge symmetry potential being integrated out, our action can\nconsistently reduce to the original undoubled Green-Schwarz action. Thanks to\nthe twofold spin groups, the action is unique: it is specific choices of the\nNS-NS backgrounds that distinguish IIA or IIB, as well as lead to\nnon-Riemannian or non-relativistic superstring a la Gomis-Ooguri which might\ndeserve the nomenclature, type IIC.\n", "  We develop a formalism for the photon emission from the quark-gluon plasma\nwith an external electromagnetic field. We then use it to investigate the\neffect of magnetic field on the photon emission from the quark-gluon plasma\ncreated in $AA$ collisions. We find that even for very optimistic assumption on\nthe magnitude of the magnetic field generated in $AA$ collisions its effect on\nthe photon emission rate is practically negligible. For this reason the\nmagnetic field cannot generate a significant azimuthal asymmetry in the photon\nspectrum.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new ultra-faint dwarf satellite companion of the\nMilky Way based on the early survey data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru\nStrategic Program. This new satellite, Virgo I, which is located in the\nconstellation of Virgo, has been identified as a statistically significant (5.5\nsigma) spatial overdensity of star-like objects with a well-defined main\nsequence and red giant branch in their color-magnitude diagram. The\nsignificance of this overdensity increases to 10.8 sigma when the relevant\nisochrone filter is adopted for the search. Based on the distribution of the\nstars around the likely main sequence turn-off at r ~ 24 mag, the distance to\nVirgo I is estimated as 87 kpc, and its most likely absolute magnitude\ncalculated from a Monte Carlo analysis is M_V = -0.8 +/- 0.9 mag. This stellar\nsystem has an extended spatial distribution with a half-light radius of 38\n+12/-11 pc, which clearly distinguishes it from a globular cluster with\ncomparable luminosity. Thus, Virgo I is one of the faintest dwarf satellites\nknown and is located beyond the reach of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This\ndemonstrates the power of this survey program to identify very faint dwarf\nsatellites. This discovery of VirgoI is based only on about 100 square degrees\nof data, thus a large number of faint dwarf satellites are likely to exist in\nthe outer halo of the Milky Way.\n", "  We present a theory illuminating the cross-over from strong-field tunnelling\nionization to weak-field multiphoton ionization in the interaction of a\nclassical laser field with a hydrogen atom. A simple formula is derived in\nwhich the ionization amplitude appears as a product of two separate amplitudes.\nThe first describes the initial polarization of the atom by virtual multiphoton\nabsorption and the second the subsequent tunnelling out of the polarized atom.\nTunnelling directly from the ground state and multiphoton absorption without\ntunnelling appear naturally as the limits of the theory.\n", "  Due to its dominance in the low energy eta-nucleon interaction, the S11\nN$^*$(1535) resonance enters as an important ingredient in the analyses of\nexperiments aimed at finding evidence for the existence of eta-mesic nuclei.\nThe static properties of the resonance get modified inside the nucleus and its\nmomentum distribution is used in deciding these properties as well as the\nkinematics in the analyses. Here we show that given the possibility for the\nexistence of an N$^*$-$^3$He quasibound state, the relative momentum\ndistribution of an N$^*$ and $^3$He inside such a $^4$He is narrower than that\nof neutron-$^3$He in $^4$He. Results for the N$^*$-$^{24}$Mg system are also\npresented. The present exploratory work could be useful in motivating searches\nof exotic N$^*$-nucleus quasibound states as well as in performing analyses of\neta meson production data.\n", "  The influence of YBa2Cu3O4 (YBCO) superconductor layer (S-layer) with varying\nthickness d-YBCO = 20 to 50 nm on the magnetic coupling between two\nLa0.67Ca0.33MnO3 (LCMO) ferromagnet layers (F-layer, thickness d-LCMO = 50 nm)\nin F/S/F heterostructures (HSs) was investigated by measuring global\nmagnetization (M) in a temperature (T) range = 2 - 300 K and magnetic field (H)\nrange = 0 - 10 kOe. All the HSs were superconducting with critical temperature\n(Tc) decreasing from = 78 to 36 K with decrease in d-YBCO, whereas the\nferromagnetic ordering temperature Tm = 250 K did not change much.\nSystematically measured M-H loops of all HSs at both T > Tc and T < Tc show\nthree main results- (a) the two step magnetic reversal above Tc converts into a\nfour step reversal below Tc in HSs with d-YBCO >= 30 nm, (b) the magnetic field\ncorresponding to the additional two switching steps and their magnitude show\ncharacteristic evolution with T and d-YBCO and (c) the HS with d-YBCO = 20 nm\nshows radically different behaviour, where the two step magnetic reversal above\nTc continues to persist below Tc and converts into a single step reversal at T\n<< Tc. The first two results indicate magnetostatic coupling between the\nmagnetic domains and the vortices across the two F/S interfaces resulting in\nreversal dynamics different from that deep within the LCMO layers. Whereas, the\nresult c reveals indirect exchange coupling between LCMO layers through the\nsuperconducting YBCO layer, which is a clear experimental evidence of\ncoexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity in nm scale F/S/F HSs\nexpected theoretically by C.A.R. Sa de Melo (Physica C 387, 17-25 (2003)).\n", "  We introduce a new kind of spontaneous four wave mixing process for the\ngeneration of photon pairs, in which the four waves involved counter-propagate\nin a guided-wave \\chi^{(3)} medium; we refer to this process as\ncounter-propagating spontaneous four wave mixing (CP-SFWM). We show that for\nthe simplest CP-SFWM source, in which all waves propagate in the same\npolarization and transverse mode and in which self- and cross-phase modulation\neffects are negligible, phasematching is attained automatically regardless of\ndispersion in the fiber or waveguide. Furthermore, we show that in two distinct\nversions of this source (both pumps pulsed, or one pump pulsed and the\nremaining one monochromatic), the two-photon state is automatically factorable\nprovided that the length of the nonlinear medium exceeds a certain threshold,\neasily achievable in practice since this threshold length tends to be in the\nrange of mm to cm. We also show that if one of the pumps approaches the\nmonochromatic limit, and for a sufficient nonlinear medium length, the\nbandwidth of one of the two photons in a given pair may be reduced to the level\nof MHz, compatible with electronic transitions for the implementation of\natom-photon interfaces, without the use of optical cavities.\n", "  The average star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies has been declining since\nredshift of 2. A fraction of galaxies quench and become quiescent. We constrain\ntwo key properties of the quenching process: the quenching time scale and the\nquenching rate among galaxies. We achieve this by analyzing the galaxy number\ndensity profile in NUV-u color space and the distribution in NUV-u v.s. u-i\ncolor-color diagram with a simple toy-model framework. We focus on galaxies in\nthree mass bins between 10 to 10 and 10 to 10.6 solar mass. In the NUV-u v.s.\nu-i color-color diagram, the red u-i galaxies exhibit a different slope from\nthe slope traced by the star-forming galaxies. This angled distribution and the\nnumber density profile of galaxies in NUV-u space strongly suggest that the\ndecline of the SFR in galaxies has to accelerate before they turn quiescent. We\nmodel this color-color distribution with a two-phase exponential decline star\nformation history. The models with an e-folding time in the second phase (the\nquenching phase) of 0.5 Gyr best fit the data. We further use the NUV-u number\ndensity profile to constrain the quenching rate among star-forming galaxies as\na function of mass. Adopting an e-folding time of 0.5 Gyr in the second phase\n(or the quenching phase), we found the quenching rate to be 19%/Gyr, 25%/Gyr\nand 33%/Gyr for the three mass bins. These are upper limits of quenching rate\nas the transition zone could also be populated by rejuvenated red-sequence\ngalaxies.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the formation of an inverse S-shaped filament\nprior to its eruption in active region NOAA 11884 from October 31 to November\n2, 2013. In the initial stage, clockwise rotation of a small positive sunspot\naround the main negative trailing sunspot formed a curved filament. Then the\nsmall sunspot cancelled with negative magnetic flux to create a longer\nactive-region filament with an inverse S-shape. At the cancellation site a\nbrightening was observed in UV and EUV images and bright material was\ntransferred to the filament. Later the filament erupted after cancellation of\ntwo opposite polarities under the upper part of the filament. Nonlinear\nforce-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation of vector photospheric fields suggests\nthat the filament may have a twisted structure, but this cannot be confirmed\nfrom the current observations.\n", "  Within the hierarchical quantum master equation (HQME) framework, an approach\nis presented, which allows a numerically exact description of nonequilibrium\ncharge transport in nanosystems with strong electronic-vibrational coupling.\nThe method is applied to a generic model of vibrationally coupled transport\nconsidering a broad spectrum of parameters ranging from the nonadiabatic to the\nadiabatic regime and including both resonant and off-resonant transport. We\nshow that nonequilibrium effects are important in all these regimes. In\nparticular in the off-resonant transport regime, the inelastic co-tunneling\nsignal is analyzed for a vibrational mode in full nonequilibrium, revealing a\ncomplex interplay of different transport processes and deviations from the\ncommonly used $G_0/2$-thumb-rule. In addition, the HQME-approach is used to\nbenchmark approximate master equation and nonequilibrium Green's function\nmethods.\n", "  We perform two-dimensional axially symmetric radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations to assess the impact of outflows and radiative force feedback from\nmassive protostars by varying when the protostellar outflow starts, the ratio\nof ejection to accretion rates, and the strength of the wide angle disk wind\ncomponent. The star formation efficiency, i.e. the ratio of final stellar mass\nto initial core mass, is dominated by radiative forces and the ratio of outflow\nto accretion rates. Increasing this ratio has three effects: First, the\nprotostar grows slower with a lower luminosity at any given time, lowering\nradiative feedback. Second, bipolar cavities cleared by the outflow are larger,\nfurther diminishing radiative feedback on disk and core scales. Third, the\nhigher momentum outflow sweeps up more material from the collapsing envelope,\ndecreasing the protostar's potential mass reservoir via entrainment. The star\nformation efficiency varies with the ratio of ejection to accretion rates from\n50% in the case of very weak outflows to as low as 20% for very strong\noutflows. At latitudes between the low density bipolar cavity and the high\ndensity accretion disk, wide angle disk winds remove some of the gas, which\notherwise would be part of the accretion flow onto the disk; varying the\nstrength of these wide angle disk winds, however, alters the final star\nformation efficiency by only +/-6%. For all cases, the opening angle of the\nbipolar outflow cavity remains below 20 degree during early protostellar\naccretion phases, increasing rapidly up to 65 degree at the onset of radiation\npressure feedback.\n", "  We report on the results from a large observational campaign on the bare\nSeyfert galaxy Ark 120, jointly carried out in 2014 with XMM-Newton, Chandra,\nand NuSTAR. The fortunate line of sight to this source, devoid of any\nsignificant absorbing material, provides an incomparably clean view to the\nnuclear regions of an active galaxy. Here we focus on the analysis of the iron\nfluorescence features, which form a composite emission pattern in the 6$-$7 keV\nband. The prominent K$\\alpha$ line from neutral iron at 6.4 keV is resolved in\nthe Chandra High-Energy Transmission Grating spectrum to a full-width at half\nmaximum of 4700$^{+2700}_{-1500}$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with an origin from\nthe optical broad-line region. Excess components are detected on both sides of\nthe narrow K$\\alpha$ line: the red one (6.0$-$6.3 keV) clearly varies in\nstrength in about one year, and hints at the presence of a broad, mildly\nasymmetric line from the accretion disk; the blue one (6.5$-$7.0 keV), instead,\nis likely a blend of different contributions, and appears to be constant when\nintegrated over long enough exposures. However, the Fe K excess emission map\ncomputed over the 7.5 days of the XMM-Newton monitoring shows that both the red\nand the blue features are actually highly variable on timescales of\n$\\sim$10$-$15 hours, suggesting that they might arise from short-lived hotspots\non the disk surface, located within a few tens of gravitational radii from the\ncentral supermassive black hole and possibly illuminated by magnetic\nreconnection events. Any alternative explanation would still require a highly\ndynamic, inhomogeneous disk/coronal system, involving clumpiness and/or\ninstability.\n", "  We present a new mechanism for a spin blockade effect associated with a\nchange in the type of magnetic anisotropy over oxidation state in a single\nmolecule transistor, by taking an example of an individual\nEu$_{2}$(C$_{8}$H$_{8}$)$_{3}$ molecule weakly coupled to non-magnetic\nelectrodes without linker groups. The molecule switches its magnetization\ndirection from in-plane to out-of-plane when it is charged. In other words, the\nmagnetic anisotropy of the molecule changes from easy plane to easy axis when\nthe molecule is charged. By solving the master equation based on model\nHamiltonian, we find that current through the molecule is highly suppressed at\nlow bias independently of gate voltage due to the interplay between spin\nselection rules and the change in the type of magnetic anisotropy. Transitions\nbetween the lowest magnetic levels in successive charge states are forbidden\nbecause the magnetic levels differ by $|\\Delta M| > 1/2$ due to the change in\nthe type of magnetic anisotropy, although the total spins differ by $|\\Delta\nS|=1/2$. This current suppression can be lifted by significant B field, and the\nthreshold B field varies as a function of the field direction and the strength\nof magnetic anisotropy. The spin blockade effect shed light on switching the\nmagnetization direction by non-spin-polarized current and on exploring effects\nof this property coupled to other molecular degrees of freedom.\n", "  We performed Se and F-NMR measurements on single crystals of (TMTSF)2FSO3 to\ncharacterize the electronic structures of different phases in the\nTemperature-Pressure phase diagram, determined by precise transport\nmeasurements [Jo et al., Phys. Rev. B67, 014516 (2003)]. We claim that such\nvarieties of electronic states in the refined phase diagram are caused by\nstrong couplings of the conduction electrons with FSO3 anions, especially with\nthe permanent electric dipoles on the anions. We suggest that as temperature\ndecreases, the FSO3 anions form orientational ordering through two steps; first\nonly the tetrahedrons form an orientational order leaving the orientations of\nthe electronic dipoles in random (transition I); then the dipoles form a\nperfect orientational order at a lower temperature (transition II). In the\nintermediate temperature range between transitions I and II, we found an\nappreciable enhancement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous widths of 77Se-NMR\nspectrum. From the analysis of the angular dependence of the linewidth, we\nattributed these anomalies to the intramolecular charge disproportionation or\nimbalance and its slow dynamics caused by the coupling with the permanent\nelectric dipole of anion. Results of 19F-NMR relaxation and lineshape\nmeasurements support this picture very well. Electronic structures at higher\npressures up to 1.25 GPa are discussed on the basis of the results of the 77Se\nand 19F-NMR measurements.\n", "  Vector mesons and the $W$ gauge boson share some common features, such as the\nspin and a very short lifetime. The electromagnetic properties of the $W$ are\nlinked to its gauge nature and thus a big effort has been devoted to measure\nthem, while accounting for its instability. In this work, we elaborate on how\nthese ideas can be translated to study vector mesons. We focus in the unstable\nproperty of such states and the restrictions from electromagnetic gauge\ninvariance, describing the differences and similarities. Then, we describe the\nfour pseudoscalars electroproduction as an analog to the $e^+e^- \\to 4\nfermions$ process, used to study the electromagnetic properties of the $W$\nboson. We point out that the current experimental capabilities are reaching the\npossibility to measure the magnetic dipole moment of light vector mesons.\n", "  We have performed a 3-D Monte Carlo simulation of a system composed of two\nidentical light quarks ($qq$) and two identical antiquarks ($\\bar Q\\bar Q$) and\ndetermined whether it is energetically more favorable to form a tetraquark or\ntwo mesons, as a function of the interparticle separation distance which, for a\nfixed number of particles, can be identified as a particle density. In this\nproceedings, we highlight the main results and elaborate on the implications in\nproperties like the correlation function for two-mesons and characterize the\nisolated diquark correlation function. We analize the four-body potential\nevolution and exhibit its linear behavior as a function of the invariant\ndistance. We track the dynamical flipping among configurations to determine the\nrecombination probability, exhibiting the importance of the tetraquark state.\n", "  Because WISE J085510.83$-$071442.5 (hereafter WISE 0855-0714) is the coldest\nknown brown dwarf ($\\sim250$ K) and one of the Sun's closest neighbors (2.2\npc), it offers a unique opportunity for studying a planet-like atmosphere in an\nunexplored regime of temperature. To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in\nits atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series\nphotometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope during two 23~hr periods that were separated by several months.\nFor both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of\n4-5% and 3-4% in the first and second epochs, respectively. The light curves\nare semi-periodic in the first epoch for both bands, but are more irregular in\nthe second epoch. Models of patchy clouds have predicted a large increase in\nmid-IR variability amplitudes (for a given cloud covering fraction) with the\nappearance of water ice clouds at $T_{\\rm eff}<$375 K, so if such clouds are\nresponsible for the variability of WISE 0855-0714, then its small amplitudes of\nvariability indicate a very small deviation in cloud coverage between\nhemispheres. Alternatively, the similarity in mid-IR variability amplitudes\nbetween WISE 0855-0714 and somewhat warmer T and Y dwarfs may suggest that they\nshare a common origin for their variability (i.e., not water clouds). In\naddition to our variability data, we have examined other constraints on the\npresence of water ice clouds in the atmosphere of WISE 0855-0714, including the\nrecent mid-IR spectrum from \\citet{ske16}. We find that robust evidence of such\nclouds is not yet available.\n", "  Coevolution between supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies is\nuniversally adopted in models for galaxy formation. In the absence of feedback\nfrom active galactic nuclei, simulated massive galaxies keep forming stars in\nthe local Universe. From an observational point of view, however, such\ncoevolution remains unclear. We present a stellar population analysis of\ngalaxies with direct BH mass measurements and the BH mass-{\\sigma} relation as\na working framework. We find that over-massive BH galaxies, i.e., galaxies\nlying above the best-fitting BH mass-{\\sigma} line, tend to be older and more\n{\\alpha}-element enhanced than under-massive BH galaxies. The scatter in the BH\nmass-{\\sigma}-[{\\alpha}/Fe] plane is significantly lower than in the standard\nBH mass-{\\sigma} relation. We interpret this trend as an imprint of active\ngalactic nucleus feedback on the star formation histories of massive galaxies.\n", "  The recent detections of the binary black hole mergers GW150914 and GW151226\nhave inaugurated the field of gravitational-wave astronomy. For the two main\nformation channels that have been proposed for these sources, isolated binary\nevolution in galactic fields and dynamical formation in dense star clusters,\nthe predicted masses and merger rates overlap significantly, complicating any\nastrophysical claims that rely on measured masses alone. Here, we examine the\ndistribution of spin- orbit misalignments expected for binaries from the field\nand from dense star clusters. Under standard assumptions for black-hole natal\nkicks, we find that black-hole binaries similar to GW150914 could be formed\nwith significant spin-orbit misalignment only through dynamical processes. In\nparticular, these heavy-black-hole binaries can only form with a significant\nspin-orbit anti-alignment in the dynamical channel. Our results suggest that\nfuture detections of merging black hole binaries with measurable spins will\nallow us to identify the main formation channel for these systems.\n", "  Interstellar Pickup ions (PUIs) play a significant part in mediating the\nsolar wind (SW) interaction with the interstellar medium. In this paper, we\nexamine the details of spatial variation of the PUI velocity distribution\nfunction (VDF) in the SW by solving the PUI transport equation. We assume the\nPUI distribution is isotropic resulting from strong pitch-angle scattering by\nwave-particle interaction. A three-dimensional model combining the MHD\ntreatment of the background SW and neutrals with a kinetic treatment of PUIs\nthroughout the heliosphere and the surrounding local interstellar medium (LISM)\nhas been developed. The model generates PUI power law tails via second-order\nFermi process. We analyze how PUIs transform across the heliospheric\ntermination shock (TS) and obtain the PUI phase space distribution in the inner\nheliosheath including continuing velocity diffusion. Our simulated PUI spectra\nare compared with observations made by New Horizons, Ulysses, Voyager 1, 2 and\nCassini, and a satisfactory agreement is demonstrated. Some specific features\nin the observations, for example, a cutoff of PUI VDF at $v = V_{SW}$ and a $f\n\\propto v^{-5}$ tail in the reference frame of the SW, are well represented by\nthe model.\n", "  A low-energy radioactive ion beam facility for the production and study of\nnuclei produced close to the proton drip line is under development at the\nAccelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyv\\\"askyl\\\"a, Finland. The\nfacility will take advantage of the mass selectivity of the recently\ncommissioned MARA vacuum-mode mass separator. The ions selected by MARA will be\nstopped and thermalised in a small-volume gas cell prior to extraction and\nfurther mass separation. The gas cell design allows for resonance laser\nionisation/spectroscopy both in-gas-cell and in-gas-jet. The facility will\ninclude experimental setups allowing ion counting, mass measurement and decay\nspectroscopy.\n", "  A theoretical study of elastic electron collisions with 9 conformers of the\ngas-phase amino acid $\\alpha$-alanine (CH$_3$CH(NH$_2$)COOH) is performed. The\neigenphase sums, resonance features, differential and integral cross sections\nare computed for each individual conformer. Resonance positions for the\nlow-energy $\\pi^*$ shape resonance are found to vary from 2.6 eV to 3.1 eV and\nthe resonance widths from 0.3 eV to 0.5 eV. Averaged cross sections for thermal\nmixtures of the 9 conformers are presented. Both theoretical and experimental\npopulation ratios are considered. Thermally-averaged cross sections obtained\nusing the best theoretical estimates give reasonable agreement with the\nobserved thermal cross sections. Excited conformers IIA and IIB make a large\ncontribution to this average due to their large permanent dipole moments.\n", "  We discuss the engineering of p-AlGaN cladding layers for achieving efficient\ntunnel-injected III-Nitride ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV LEDs) in the\nUV-A spectral range. We show that capacitance-voltage measurements can be used\nto estimate the compensation and doping in p-AlGaN layers located between the\nmulti-quantum well region and the tunnel junction layer. By increasing the\np-type doping concentration to overcome the background compensation, on-wafer\nexternal quantum efficiency and wall-plug efficiency of 3.37% and 1.62% were\nachieved for tunnel-injected UV LEDs emitting at 325 nm. We also show that\ninterband tunneling hole injection can be used to realize UV LEDs without any\nacceptor doping. The work discussed here provides new understanding of hole\ndoping and transport in AlGaN-based UV LEDs, and demonstrates the excellent\nperformance of tunnel-injected LEDs for the UV-A wavelength range.\n", "  Using a sample of (470.9 +- 2.8) x 10^6 BB-bar pairs, we measure the decay\nbranching fraction B(B^0 -> D^*- pi^+ pi^- pi^+) = (7.26 +- 0.11 +- 0.31) x\n10^-3, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.\nOur measurement will be helpful in studies of lepton universality by measuring\nB(B^0 -> D^*- tau^+ nu_tau) using tau^+ -> pi^+ pi^- pi^+ nu-bar_tau decays,\nnormalized to B(B^0 -> D^*- pi^+ pi^- pi^+.\n", "  Quantum control of systems plays important roles in modern science and\ntechnology. The ultimate goal of quantum control is to achieve high fidelity\nuniversal control in the time-optimal way. Although high fidelity universal\ncontrol has been reported in various quantum systems, experimental\nimplementation of time-optimal universal control remains elusive. Here we\nreport the experimental realization of time-optimal universal control of spin\nqubits in diamond. By generalizing a recent method for solving quantum\nbrachistochrone equations [X. Wang, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 170501\n(2015)], we obtained accurate minimum time protocols for multiple qubits with\nfixed qubits' interactions and constrained control field. Single- and two-qubit\ntime-optimal gates are experimentally implemented with fidelities of 99%\nobtained via quantum process tomography. Our work provides a time-optimal route\nto achieve accurate quantum control, and unlocks new capabilities for emerging\nfield of time-optimal control in general quantum systems.\n", "  We study the energy spectrum of atoms trapped in a vertical 1D optical\nlattice in close proximity to a reflective surface. We propose an effective\nmodel to describe the interaction between the atoms and the surface at any\ndistance. Our model includes the long-range Casimir-Polder potential together\nwith a short-range Lennard-Jones potential, which are considered\nnon-perturbatively with respect to the optical lattice potential. We find an\nintricate energy spectrum which contains a pair of loosely-bound states\nlocalized close to the surface in addition to a surface-modified Wannier-Stark\nladder at long distances. Atomic interferometry involving those loosely-bound\natom-surface states is proposed to probe the adsorption dynamics of atoms on\nmirrors.\n", "  When a circumbinary disk surrounds a binary whose secondary's mass is at\nleast $\\sim 10^{-2}\\times$ the primary's mass, a nearly empty cavity with\nradius a few times the binary separation is carved out of the disk. Narrow\nstreams of material pass from the inner edge of the circumbinary disk into the\ndomain of the binary itself, where they eventually join onto the small disks\norbiting the members of the binary. Using data from 3-d MHD simulations of this\nprocess, we determine the luminosity of these streams; it is mostly due to weak\nlaminar shocks, and is in general only a few percent of the luminosity of\nadjacent regions of either the circumbinary disk or the \"mini-disks\". This\nluminosity therefore hardly affects the deficit in the thermal continuum\npredicted on the basis of a perfectly dark gap region.\n", "  Among the most studied approaches to introduce the breaking of Lorentz\nsymmetry, the generic approach is one of the most frequently used for\nphenomenology, it converges on the modification of the free particle dispersion\nrelation. Using this approach in the photon sector, we have calculated the\nsquared probability amplitude for vacuum Cherenkov radiation and photon decay\nby correcting the QED coupling at tree level and first order in LIV parameters.\nFor the lower order energy correction we calculate the emission and decay rate\nfor each process.\n", "  The analytical formula for the time-resolved dynamical Franz-Keldysh effect\n(Tr-DFKE) under an elliptically polarized laser in sub-femtosecond time-scale\nis reported. The Houston function is assumed as the time-dependent wave\nfunction of the parabolic two-band system. The resulting formula shows the\nsub-cycle change of the optical properties for elliptically polarization; the\nmodulation of the dielectric function becomes smaller than that of linear\npolarization. On the other hand, the subcycle modulation of the dielectric\nfunction disappears for a circularly polarized laser, which is a significant\nfeature of the Tr-DFKE. This analytical formulas show good qualitative\nagreement with the first-principle calculation employing the time-dependent\ndensity functional theory for diamond.\n", "  Theoretical models of low-energy (d,p) single-neutron transfer reactions are\na crucial link between experimentation, nuclear structure and nuclear\nastrophysical studies. Whereas reaction models that use local optical\npotentials are insensitive to short-range physics in the deuteron, we show that\nincluding the inherent nonlocality of the nucleon-target interactions and\nrealistic deuteron wave functions generates significant sensitivity to high n-p\nrelative momenta and to the underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction. We quantify\nthis effect upon the deuteron channel distorting potentials within the\nframework of the adiabatic deuteron breakup model. The implications for\ncalculated (d,p) cross sections and spectroscopic information deduced from\nexperiments are discussed.\n", "  A systematic study of irreversible magnetization was performed in bulk\nNiobium after different surface treatments. Starting with smooth surfaces and\nabrading them, a strong increase of the critical current is observed up an\napparent limiting value. An impressive change of the critical current is also\nobserved in the surface superconductivity (SSC) state, reaching values of the\nsame order of magnitude as in the mixed state. We explain also the observation\nof strong SSC for magnetic field perpendicular to larges facets in terms of\nnucleation of SC along bumps of a corrugated surface.\n", "  Starting from a recently proposed linear formulation in terms of auxiliary\nfields, we study $n$-field generalizations of Born and Born-Infeld theories. In\nthis description the Lagrangian is quadratic in the vector field strengths and\nthe symmetry properties (including the characteristic self-duality) of the\ncorresponding non-linear theory are manifest as on-shell duality symmetries and\ndepend on the choice of the (homogeneous) manifold spanned by the auxiliary\nscalar fields and the symplectic frame. By suitably choosing these defining\nproperties of the quadratic Lagrangian, we are able to reproduce some known\nmulti-field Born-Infeld theories and to derive new non-linear models, such as\nthe $n$-field Born theory. We also discuss non-Abelian generalizations of these\ntheories obtained by choosing the vector fields in the adjoint representation\nof an off-shell compact global symmetry group $K$ and replacing them by\nnon-Abelian, $K$-covariant field strengths, thus promoting $K$ to a gauge\ngroup.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of WISEA\nJ061543.91$-$124726.8, which we rediscovered as a high motion object in the\nAllWISE survey. The spectra of this object are unusual; while the red optical\n($\\lambda >$ 7,000 \\AA) and near-infrared spectra exhibit characteristic TiO,\nVO, and H$_{2}$O bands of a late-M dwarf, the blue portion of its optical\nspectrum shows a significant excess of emission relative to late-M type\ntemplates. The excess emission is relatively featureless, with the exception of\na prominent and very broad Na I D doublet. We find that no single, ordinary\nstar can reproduce these spectral characteristics. The most likely explanation\nis an unresolved binary system of an M7 dwarf and a cool white dwarf. The flux\nof a cool white dwarf drops in the optical red and near-infrared, due to\ncollision-induced absorption, thus allowing the flux of a late-M dwarf to show\nthrough. This scenario, however, does not explain the Na D feature, which is\nunlike that of any known white dwarf, but which could perhaps be explained via\nunusual abundance or pressure conditions.\n", "  The structural properties of the simulated $\\rm Cu_{\\alpha}Zr_{1-\\alpha}$\nglassy alloys are studied in the wide range of the copper concentration\n$\\alpha$ to clarify the impact of the composition on the number density of the\nicosahedral clusters. Both bond orientational order parameters and Voronoi\ntessellation methods are used to identify these clusters. Our analysis shows\nthat abundance of the icosahedral clusters and the chemical composition of\nthese clusters are essentially non monotonic versus $\\alpha$ and demonstrate\nlocal extrema. That qualitatively explains the existence of pinpoint\ncompositions of high glass-forming ability observing in Cu-Zr alloys. Finally,\nit has been shown that Voronoi method overestimates drastically the abundance\nof the icosahedral clusters in comparison with the bond orientational order\nparameters one.\n", "  We develop the method of vector-fields to further study Dispersive Wave\nEquations.\n  Radial vector fields are used to get a-priori estimates such as the Morawetz\nestimate on solutions of Dispersive Wave Equations.\n  A key to such estimates is the repulsiveness or nontrapping conditions on the\nflow corresponding to the wave equation. Thus this method is limited to\npotential perturbations which are repulsive, that is the radial derivative\npointing away from the origin. In this work, we generalize this method to\ninclude potentials which are repulsive relative to a line in space (in three or\nhigher dimensions), among other cases. This method is based on constructing\nmulti-centered vector fields as multipliers, cancellation lemmas and energy\nlocalization.\n", "  The polarization effects of the processes $\\tau \\rightarrow K^{-} \\pi^{0}\n\\nu_{\\tau}$ are described in the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model.\nThe intermediate vector meson $K^{*}(892)$ is taken into account. The\ncontribution of these effects to the differential decay width is obtained.\n", "  A class of four dimensional spherically symmetric and static geometries with\nconstant topological Euler density is studied. These geometries are shown to\nsolve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell system when non-linear Born-Infeld-like\nelectrodynamics is employed.\n", "  The present study reports the formation of self-assembled droplet pattern on\nthe PDMS polymer coated over grooved side of DVD under saturated vapours of\nalcohols. Comparison of the results with breath figures formed over\nunconstrained side of DVD is made. Four different environments namely methanol,\nethanol, 2-propanol and n-butanol are used for the analysis. It is observed\nthat the pattern formation occurs with methanol and ethanol vapours and not\nwith 2-propanol and n-butanol. The difference is pattern formation with\ndifferent alcohols is attributed to the variation in chain length and the\npresence of hydrophobic groups in alcohols, as given by Traube's rule. The\ndistortion of patterns over constrained surface is attributed to the depinning\nof contact lines.\n", "  We introduce a two-dimensional (2D) system, which can be implemented in\ndual-core planar optical couplers with the Kerr nonlinearity in its cores,\nmaking it possible to blend effects of the PT symmetry, represented by the\nbalanced linear gain and loss in the two cores, and spin-orbit coupling (SOC),\nemulated by a spatially biased coupling between the cores. Families of 1D and\n2D solitons and their stability boundaries are identified. In the 1D setting,\nthe addition of the SOC terms leads, at first, to shrinkage of the stability\narea for PT-symmetric solitons, which is followed by its rapid expansion. 2D\nsolitons have their stability region too, in spite of the simultaneous action\nof two major destabilizing factors, viz., the collapse driven by the Kerr\nnonlinearity, and a trend towards spontaneous breakup of the gain-loss balance.\nIn the limit of the SOC terms dominating over the intrinsic diffraction, the 1D\nsystem gives rise to a new model for gap solitons, which admits exact\nanalytical solutions.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies have been identified by the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope as a rare class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei\n(AGN). The lowest-redshift candidate among them is the source 1H 0323+342. Here\nwe present quasi-simultaneous Gemini near-infrared and Keck optical\nspectroscopy for it, from which we derive a black hole mass based on both the\nbroad Balmer and Paschen emission lines. We supplement these observations with\na NuSTAR X-ray spectrum taken about two years earlier, from which we constrain\nthe black hole mass based on the short timescale spectral variability. Our\nmultiwavelength observations suggest a black hole mass of ~2x10^7 solar masses,\nwhich agrees well with previous estimates. We build the spectral energy\ndistribution and show that it is dominated by the thermal and reprocessed\nemission from the accretion disc rather than the non-thermal jet component. A\ndetailed spectral fitting with the energy-conserving accretion disc model of\nDone et al. constrains the Eddington ratio to L/L_Edd ~ 0.5 for a\n(non-rotating) Schwarzschild black hole and to L/L_Edd ~ 1 for a Kerr black\nhole with dimensionless spin of a*=0.8. Higher spin values and so higher\nEddington ratios are excluded, since they would strongly overpredict the\nobserved soft X-ray flux.\n", "  We show that spin-orbit interaction and elastic spin-Hall effect can exist in\na classical mechanical system consisting of a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice\nof masses and springs. The band structure shows the presence of splitting at K\npoint induced by the difference of longitudinal and transverse elastic\nconstant, and this splitting can be regarded as an effective Dresselhaus-type\nspin-orbit coupling. Interestingly, as an initial displacement away from the\nequilibrium is applied, the time evolution simulation shows that waves of\ndifferent spin polarization propagates along different directions at the Gamma\nand K point, which is characteristic of spin-Hall effect. Several cases for\nspin-Hall effect are also discussed.\n", "  The shandite family of solids, with hexagonal structure and composition\nA3M2X2 (A = Ni,Co,Rh,Pd; M = Pb,In,Sn,Tl; X = S,Se), has attracted recent\nresearch attention due to promising applications as thermoelectric materials.\nHerein we discuss the electron and phonon transport properties of\nshandite-structured Ni3Sn2S2, based on a combination of density functional\ntheory (DFT), Boltzmann transport theory, and experimental measurements.\nNi3Sn2S2 exhibits a metallic and non-magnetic groundstate with Ni$^0$ oxidation\nstate and very low charge on Sn and S atoms. Seebeck coefficients obtained from\ntheoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with those measured\nexperimentally between 100 and 600 K. From the calculation of the ratio\n$\\sigma$/$\\tau$ between the electronic conductivity and relaxation time, and\nthe experimental determination of electron conductivity, we extract the\nvariation of the scattering rate (1/$\\tau$) with temperature between 300 and\n600 K, which turns out to be almost linear, thus implying that the dominant\nelectron scattering mechanism in this temperature range is via phonons. The\nelectronic thermal conductivity, which deviates only slightly from the\nWiedemann-Franz law, provides the main contribution to thermal transport. The\nsmall lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is calculated from the\nphonon structure and third-order force constants, and is only ~2\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 300 K (less than 10% of the total thermal conductivity),\nwhich is confirmed by experimental measurements. Overall, Ni$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is\na poor thermoelectric material (ZT~0.01 at 300 K), principally due to the low\nabsolute value of the Seebeck coefficient. However, the understanding of its\ntransport properties will be useful for the rationalization of the\nthermoelectric behavior of other, more promising members of the shandite\nfamily.\n", "  Magnetic fields on the surface of the Sun and stars in general imprint or\nmodify the polarization state of the electromagnetic radiation that is leaving\nfrom the star. The inference of solar/stellar magnetic fields is performed by\ndetecting, studying and modeling polarized light from the target star. In this\nreview we present an overview of techniques that are used to study the\natmosphere of the Sun, and particularly those that allow to infer magnetic\nfields. We have combined a small selection of theory on polarized radiative\ntransfer, inversion techniques and we discuss a number of results from\nchromospheric inversions.\n", "  Axiomatic quantum field theory (QFT) provides a rigorous mathematical\nfoundation for QFT, and it is the basis for proving some important general\nresults, such as the well-known spin-statistics theorem. Free-field QFT meets\nthe axioms of axiomatic QFT, showing they are consistent. Nevertheless, even\nafter more than 50 years, there is still no known non-trivial theory of quantum\nfields with interactions in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime that meets the\nsame axioms.\n  This paper provides a similar axiomatic basis for parameterized QFT, in which\nan invariant, fifth path parameter is added to the usual four spacetime\nposition arguments of quantum fields. Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path\nparameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states\nof the theory are allowed to be off shell. Particles are therefore\nfundamentally \"virtual\" during interaction but, in the appropriate\nnon-interacting, large-time limit, they dynamically tend towards \"physical\",\non-shell states.\n  Unlike traditional QFT, it is possible to define a mathematically consistent\ninteraction picture in parameterized QFT. This may be used to construct\ninteracting fields that meet the same axioms as the corresponding free fields.\nOne can then re-derive the Dyson series for scattering amplitudes, but without\nthe mathematical inconsistency of traditional, perturbative QFT. The present\nwork is limited to the case of scalar fields, and it does not address remaining\nissues of gauge symmetry and renormalization. Nevertheless, it still\ndemonstrates that the parameterized formalism can provide a consistent\nfoundation for the interpretation of QFT as used in practice and, perhaps, for\nbetter dealing with its further mathematical issues.\n", "  The problem of determining the angle at which a point mass launched from\nground level with a given speed is a standard exercise in mechanics. Similar,\nyet conceptually and calculationally more difficult problems have been\nsuggested to improve student proficiency in projectile motion. The problem of\ndetermining the maximum distance of a rock thrown from a rotating arm motion is\npresented and analyzed in detail in this text. The calculational results\nconfirm several conceptually derived conclusions regarding the initial throw\nposition and provide some details on the angles and the way of throwing\n(underhand or overhand) which produce the maximum throw distance.\n", "  Context. J1407 (1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 in full) is a young star in the\nScorpius-Centaurus OB association that underwent a series of complex eclipses\nover 56 days in 2007. To explain these, it was hypothesised that a secondary\nsubstellar companion, J1407b, has a giant ring system filling a large fraction\nof the Hill sphere, causing the eclipses. Observations have not successfully\ndetected J1407b, but do rule out circular orbits for the companion around the\nprimary star.\n  Aims. We test to what degree the ring model of J1407b could survive in an\neccentric orbit required to fit the observations.\n  Methods. We run N-body simulations under the AMUSE framework to test the\nstability of Hill radius-filling systems where the companion is on an eccentric\norbit.\n  Results. We strongly rule out prograde ring systems and find that a secondary\nof 60 to 100MJup with an 11 year orbital period and retrograde orbiting\nmaterial can survive for at least $10^4$ orbits and produce eclipses with\nsimilar durations as the observed one.\n", "  We analyse a sample of 21 active galactic nuclei (AGN) using data from the\nSwift satellite to study the variability properties of the population in the\nX-ray, UV and optical band. We find that the variable part of the UV-optical\nemission has a spectrum consistent with a powerlaw, with an average index of\n$-2.21\\pm0.13$, as would be expected from central illumination of a thin disc\n(index of -7/3). We also calculate the slope of a powerlaw from UV to X-ray\nvariable emission, $\\alpha_{\\rm OX,Var}$; the average for this sample is\n$\\alpha_{\\rm OX,Var} = -1.06 \\pm 0.04$. The anticorrelation of $\\alpha_{\\rm\nOX}$ with the UV luminosity, $L_{\\rm UV}$, previously found in the average\nemission is also present in the variable part: $\\alpha_{\\rm OX,Var} = (-0.177\n\\pm 0.083) {\\rm log} (L_{\\rm \\nu,Var} (2500\\,\\AA)) + (3.88 \\pm 2.33)$.\nCorrelated variability between the emission in X-rays and UV is detected\nsignificantly for 9 of the 21 sources. All these cases are consistent with the\nUV lagging the X-rays, as would be seen if the correlated UV variations were\nproduced by the reprocessing of X-ray emission. The observed UV lags are\ntentatively longer than expected for a standard thin disc.\n", "  We develop a configuration of radio-frequency (rf) cavities to dramatically\nimprove the performance of slip-stacking. Slip-stacking is an accumulation\ntechnique used at Fermilab to nearly double proton intensity by maintaining two\nbeams of different momenta in the same storage ring. The two particle beams are\nlongitudinally focused in the Recycler by two 53 MHz 100 kV rf cavities with a\nsmall frequency difference between them. We propose an additional 106 MHz 20 kV\nrf cavity with a frequency at the double the average of the upper and lower\nmain rf frequencies. We show the harmonic rf cavity cancels out the resonances\ngenerated between the two main rf cavities and we derive the relationship\nbetween the harmonic rf voltage and the main rf voltage. We find the area\nfactors that can be used to calculate the available phase space area for any\nset of beam parameters without individual simulation. We establish Booster beam\nquality requirements to achieve 99\\% slip-stacking efficiency. We measure the\nlongitudinal distribution of the Booster beam and use it to generate a\nrealistic beam model for slip-stacking simulation. We demonstrate that the\nharmonic rf cavity can not only reduce particle loss during slip-stacking, but\nalso reduce the final longitudinal emittance.\n", "  What happens when one of the parameters governing the dynamics of a\nlong-range interacting system of particles in thermal equilibrium is abruptly\nchanged (quenched) to a different value? While a short-range system, under the\nsame conditions, will relax in time to a new thermal equilibrium with a uniform\ntemperature across the system, a long-range system shows a fast relaxation to a\nnonequilibrium {\\em quasistationary state} (QSS). The lifetime of such an\noff-equilibrium state diverges with the system size, and the temperature is\nnon-uniform across the system. Quite surprisingly, the density profile in the\nQSS obtained after the quench is anticorrelated with the temperature profile in\nspace, thus exhibiting the phenomenon of {\\em temperature inversion}: denser\nregions are colder than sparser ones. We illustrate with extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations the ubiquity of this scenario in a prototypical long-range\ninteracting system subject to a variety of quenching protocols, and in a model\nthat mimics an experimental setup of atoms interacting with light in an optical\ncavity. We further demonstrate how a procedure of iterative quenching combined\nwith filtering out the high-energy particles in the system may be employed to\ncool the system. Temperature inversion is observed in nature in some\nastrophysical settings; our results imply that such a phenomenon should be\nobservable, and could even be exploitable to advantage, also in controlled\nlaboratory experiments.\n", "  Gap plasmonics deals with the properties of surface plasmons in the narrow\nregion between two metallic nanoparticles forming the gap. For sub-nanometer\ngap distances electrons can tunnel between the nanoparticles leading to the\nemergence of novel charge transfer plasmons. These are conveniently described\nwithin the quantum corrected model by introducing an artificial material with a\ntunnel conductivity inside the gap region. Here we develop a methodology for\ncomputing such tunnel conductivities within the first-principles framework of\ndensity functional theory, and apply our approach to a jellium model\nrepresentative for sodium. We show that the frequency dependence of the tunnel\nconductivity at infrared and optical frequencies can be significantly more\ncomplicated than previously thought.\n", "  When electron cyclotron (EC) driven current is first applied to the inside of\na magnetic island, the current spreads throughout the island and after a short\nperiod achieves a steady level. Using a two equation fluid model for the EC\ncurrent that allows us to examine this early evolution in detail, we analyze\nhigh-resolution simulations of a 2/1 classical tearing mode in a low-beta large\naspect-ratio circular tokamak. These simulations use a nonlinear 3D reduced-MHD\nfluid model and the JOREK code. During the initial period where the EC driven\ncurrent grows and spreads throughout the magnetic island, it is not a function\nof the magnetic flux. However, once it has reached a steady-state, it should be\na flux function. We demonstrate numerically that if sufficiently resolved\ntoroidally, the steady-state EC driven current becomes approximately a flux\nfunction. We discuss the physics of this early period of EC evolution and its\nimpact on the size of the magnetic island.\n", "  We analyze theoretically and by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nthe generation of mechanical force by a polyelectrolyte (PE) chain grafted to a\nplane. The PE is exposed to an external electric field that favors its\nadsorption on the plane. The free end of the chain is linked to a deformable\ntarget body. Varying the field one can alter the length of the non-adsorbed\npart of the chain. This entails variation of the deformation of the target body\nand hence variation of the arising in the body force. Our theoretical\npredictions for the generated force are in a very good agreement with the MD\ndata. Using the developed theory for the generated force we study the\neffectiveness of possible PE-based nano-vices, comprised of two clenching\nplanes connected by PEs and exposed to an external electric field. We exploit\nCundall-Struck solid friction model to describe the friction between a particle\nand the clenching planes. We compute the self-diffusion coefficient of a\nclenched particle and show that it drastically decreases even in weak applied\nfields. This demonstrates the efficacy of the PE-based nano-vices, which may be\na a possible alternative to the existing nano-tube nano-tweezers and optical\ntweezers.\n", "  Data from the DBA liquid argon ionization chamber experiment have been used\nto obtain an estimate on the concentration of $^{42}$Ar in the Earth's\natmosphere, $6.8^{+1.7}_{-3.2}\\cdot10^{-21}$ atoms of $^{42}$Ar per atom of\n$^{40}$Ar corresponding to the $^{42}$Ar activity of $1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$\n$\\mu$Bq per cubic meter of air.\n", "  Using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with selective\nnear- and mid-infrared photon excitations, we investigate the femtosecond\ndynamics of the charge density wave (CDW) phase in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$, as well as\nthe dynamics of CDW fluctuations at 240 K. In the CDW phase, we observe the\ncoherent oscillation of the CDW amplitude mode. At 240 K, we single out an\nultrafast component in the recovery of the CDW correlations, which we explain\nas the manifestation of electron-hole correlations. Our momentum-resolved study\nof femtosecond electron dynamics supports a mechanism for the CDW phase\nresulting from the cooperation between the interband Coulomb interaction, the\nmechanism of excitonic insulator phase formation, and electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  Creating arbitrary light patterns finds applications in various domains\nincluding lithography, beam shaping, metrology, sensing and imaging. We study\nthe formation of high-contrast light patterns that are obtained by transmission\nthrough an ordered optical element based on self-imaging.By applying the\nphase-space method, we explain phenomena such as the Talbot and the angular\nTalbot effects. We show that the image contrast is maximum when the source is\neither a plane wave or a point source, and it has a minimum for a source with\nfinite spatial extent. We compare these regimes and address some of their\nfundamental differences. Specifically, we prove that increasing the source\ndivergence reduces the contrast for the plane wave illumination but increases\nit for the point source. Also, we show that to achieve high contrast with a\npoint source, tuning the source size and its distance to the element is\ncrucial.We furthermore indicate and explore the possibility of realizing highly\ncomplex light patterns by using a periodic transmission element. These patterns\ncan have more spots in the far field than the number of diffraction orders of\nthe periodic element. We predict that the ultimate image contrast is smaller\nfor a point source compared to a plane wave. Our simulations confirm that the\nsmallest achievable spot size in the image is imposed by diffraction regardless\nof the imaging regime. Our research can be applied to similar domains e.g.\nquantum systems.\n", "  We investigated experimentally the short- and long-range correlations in the\nfluctuations of the resonance frequencies of flat, rectangular microwave\ncavities that contained antennas acting as point-like perturbations. We\ndemonstrate that their spectral properties exhibit the features typical for\nsingular statistics. Hitherto, only the nearest-neighbor spacing distribution\nhad been studied. We, in addition considered statistical measures for the\nlong-range correlations and analyzed power spectra. Thereby, we could\ncorroborate that the spectral properties change to semi-Poisson statistic with\nincreasing microwave frequency. Furthermore, the experimental results are shown\nto be well described by a model applicable to billiards containing a zero-range\nperturbation [T. Tudorovskiy et al., New. J. Phys. 12, 12302 (2010)].\n", "  For many years it has been considered puzzling how pulsar radio emission,\nsupposedly created by a circulating carousel of sub-beams, can produce the\ndriftbands demonstrated by PSR J0815+09, and more recently PSR B1839-04, which\nsimultaneously drift in opposing directions. Here we suggest that the carousels\nof these pulsars, and hence their beams, are not circular but elliptical with\naxes tilted with respect to the fiducial plane. We show that certain relatively\nunusual lines of sight can cause bi-drifting to be observed, and a simulation\nof the two known exemplars is presented. Although bi-drifting is rare,\nnon-circular beams may be common among pulsars and reveal themselves by having\nprofile centroids displaced from the fiducial plane identified by polarisation\nposition angle swings. They may also result in profiles with asymmetric and\nfrequency-dependent component evolution. It is further suggested that the\ncarousels may change their tilt by specific amounts and later reverse them.\nThis may occur suddenly, accompanying a mode change (e.g. PSR B0943+10), or\nmore gradually and short-lived as in \"flare\" pulsars (e.g. PSR B1859+07). A\nrange of pulsar behaviour (e.g. the shifting drift patterns of PSRs B0818-41\nand B0826-34) may also be the result of non-circular carousels with varying\norientation. The underlying nature of these carousels - whether they are\nexclusively generated by polar cap physics or driven by magnetospheric effects\n- is briefly discussed.\n", "  A planet having protective ozone within the collimated beam of a Gamma Ray\nBurst (GRB) may suffer ozone depletion, potentially causing a mass extinction\nevent to existing life on a planet's surface and oceans. We model the dangers\nof long GRBs to planets in the Milky Way and utilize a static statistical model\nof the Galaxy that matches major observable properties, such as the inside-out\nstar formation history, metallicity evolution, and 3-dimensional stellar number\ndensity distribution. The GRB formation rate is a function of both the star\nformation history and metallicity; however, the extent to which chemical\nevolution reduces the GRB rate over time in the Milky Way is still an open\nquestion. Therefore, we compare the damaging effects of GRBs to biospheres in\nthe Milky Way using two models. One model generates GRBs as a function of the\ninside-out star formation history. The other model follows the star formation\nhistory, but generates GRB progenitors as a function of metallicity, thereby\nfavoring metal-poor host regions of the Galaxy over time. If the GRB rate only\nfollows the star formation history, the majority of the GRBs occur in the inner\nGalaxy. However, if GRB progenitors are constrained to low metallicity\nenvironments, then GRBs only form in the metal-poor outskirts at recent epochs.\nInterestingly, over the past 1 Gyr, the surface density of stars (and their\ncorresponding planets) that survive a GRB is still greatest in the inner galaxy\nin both models. The present day danger of long GRBs to life at the solar radius\n($R_\\odot=8$ kpc) is low. We find that at least $\\sim$65% of stars survive a\nGRB over the past 1 Gyr. Furthermore, when the GRB rate was expected to have\nbeen enhanced at higher redshifts, such as $z\\gtrsim0.5$, our results suggest\nthat a large fraction of planets would have survived these lethal GRB events.\n", "  We look for all weak bases that lead to texture zeroes in the quark mass\nmatrices and contain a minimal number of parameters in the framework of the\nstandard model. Since there are ten physical observables, namely, six\nnonvanishing quark masses, three mixing angles and one CP phase, the maximum\nnumber of texture zeroes in both quark sectors is altogether nine. The nine\nzero entries can only be distributed between the up- and down-quark sectors in\nmatrix pairs with six and three texture zeroes or five and four texture zeroes.\nIn the weak basis where a quark mass matrix is nonsingular and has six zeroes\nin one sector, we find that there are 54 matrices with three zeroes in the\nother sector, obtainable through right-handed weak basis transformations. It is\nalso found that all pairs composed of a nonsingular matrix with five zeroes and\na nonsingular and nondecoupled matrix with four zeroes simply correspond to a\nweak basis choice. Without any further assumptions, none of these pairs of up-\nand down-quark mass matrices has physical content. It is shown that all\nnon-weak-basis pairs of quark mass matrices that contain nine zeroes are not\ncompatible with current experimental data. The particular case of the so-called\nnearest-neighbour-interaction pattern is also discussed.\n", "  We report the coexistence and properties of stable compact localized states\n(CLSs) and discrete solitons (DSs) for nonlinear spinor waves on a flatband\nnetwork with spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The system can be implemented by means\nof a binary Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in the corresponding optical\nlattice. In the linear limit, the SOC opens a minigap between flat and\ndispersive bands in the system's bandgap structure, and preserves the existence\nof CLSs at the flatband frequency, simultaneously lowering their symmetry.\nAdding onsite cubic nonlinearity, the CLSs persist and remain available in an\nexact analytical form, with frequencies which are smoothly tuned into the\nminigap. Inside of the minigap, the CLS and DS families are stable in narrow\nareas adjacent to the FB. Deep inside the semi-infinite gap, both the CLSs and\nDSs are stable too.\n", "  The thermally activated fracture processes in the carbon backbone of\ndiamond-like carbon nanothreads and the hydrogen desorption from them has been\nstudied by the molecular dynamics method. Specifically, the temperature\ndependence of the characteristic desorption time at T = 1700-2800 K has been\ndetermined. The activation energy and frequency factor in the Arrhenius formula\nfor the desorption rate are found. This allows estimating the desorption time\nat any temperature. The mechanical stiffness of nanothreads is calculated.\n", "  In this communication we introduce an efficient implementation of adaptive\nbiasing that greatly improves the speed of free energy computation in molecular\ndynamics simulations. We investigated the use of accelerated simulations to\ninform on compound design using a recently reported and clinically relevant\ninhibitor of the chromatin regulator BRD4. Benchmarking on our local compute\ncluster, our implementation achieves up to 2.5 times more force calls per day\nthan plumed2. Results of five 1{\\mu}second-long simulations are presented,\nwhich reveal a conformational switch in the BRD4 inhibitor between a binding\ncompetent and incompetent state. Stabilization of the switch led to a -3\nkcal/mol improvement of absolute binding free energy. These studies suggest an\nunexplored ligand design principle and offer new actionable hypotheses for\nmedicinal chemistry efforts against this druggable epigenetic target class.\n", "  We present a high energy-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering data\ninvestigation of the charge-density-wave (CDW) soft phonon mode upon entering\nthe superconducting state in $2H$-NbSe$_2$. Measurements were done close to the\nCDW ordering wavevector $\\mathbf{q}_{CDW}$ at\n$\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{q}_{CDW}+(0,0,l)$,$0.15\\leq l \\leq 0.5$, for $T=10\\,\\rm{K}$\n(CDW order) and $3.8\\,\\rm{K}$ (CDW order + superconductivity). We observe\nchanges of the phonon lineshape that are characteristic for systems with strong\nelectron-phonon coupling in the presence of a superconducting energy gap\n$2\\Delta_c$ and from which we can demonstrate an $l$-dependence of the\nsuperconducting gap. Reversely, our data imply that the CDW energy gap is\nstrongly localized along the $c^*$ direction. The confinement of the CDW gap to\na very small momentum region explains the rather low competition and easy\ncoexistence of CDW order and superconductivity in $2H$-NbSe$_2$. However, the\nenergy gained by opening $\\Delta_{CDW}$ seems to be too small to be the driving\nforce of the phase transition at $T_{CDW}=33\\,\\rm{K}$ , which is better\ndescribed as an electron-phonon coupling driven structural phase transition.\n", "  A model of a neutrino mixing with an $A_4\\times Z_3\\times Z_4$ flavour\nsymmetry is suggested. In addition to the standard model fields, the present\nmodel contains six new fields which transform under different representations\nof $A_4\\times Z_3\\times Z_4$. The model is constructed to slightly deviate from\na tri-bi-maximal model in agreement with the current experimental data, thus,\nall analysis can be done in the base of the perturbation method. Within this\nmodel, as an application, a relation between the mixing angles ($\\theta_{12},\n\\theta_{23}, \\theta_{13}$) and the Dirac CP-violation phase ($\\delta_{CP}$) is\nestablished. This relation allows a prediction of $\\delta_{CP}$ and the\nJarlskog parameter ($J_{CP}$). The predicted value $\\delta_{CP}$ is in the\n1$\\sigma$ region of the global fit for both the normal- and inverse neutrino\nmass ordering and gives $J_{CP}$ to be within the bound $|J_{CP}|\\leq 0.04$.\nFor an illustration, the model is checked numerically and gives values of the\nneutrino masses (of the order of 0.1 eV) and the mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$\n(about $9^\\circ$) very close to the current experimental data.\n", "  The origin of the Broad Line Region (BLR) in active galaxies remains unknown.\nIt seems to be related to the underlying accretion disk but an efficient\nmechanism is required to rise the material from the disk surface without giving\ntoo strong signatures of the outflow in the case of the low ionization lines.\nWe discuss in detail two proposed mechanisms: (i) radiation pressure acting on\ndust in the disk atmosphere creating a failed wind (ii) the gravitational\ninstability of the underlying disk. We compare the predicted location of the\ninner radius of the BLR in those two scenarios with the observed position\nobtained from the reverberation studies of several active galaxies. The failed\ndusty outflow model well represents the observational data while the\npredictions of the self-gravitational instability are not consistent with\nobservations. The issue remains why actually we do not see any imprints of the\nunderlying disk instability in the BLR properties.\n", "  To answer the question whether a cascade of energy exists or not in\nturbulence, we propose a set of correlation functions able to test if there is\nan irreversible transfert of energy, step by step, from large to small\nstructures. These tests are applied to real Eulerian data of a turbulent\nvelocity flow, taken in the wind grid tunnel of Modane, and also to a prototype\nmodel equation for wave turbulence. First we demonstrate the irreversible\ncharacter of the flow by using multi-time correlation function at a given point\nof space. Moreover the unexpected behavior of the test function leads us to\nconnect irreversibility and finite time singularities (intermittency). Secondly\nwe show that turbulent cascade exists, and is a dynamical process, by using a\ntest function depending on time and frequency. The cascade shows up only in the\ninertial domain where the kinetic energy is transferred more rapidly (on\naverage) from the wavenumber $k_{1}$ to $k_{2}$ than from $k_{1}$ to $k'_{2}$\nlarger than $k_{2}$.\n", "  3D printing presents an attractive alternative to visual representation of\nphysical datasets such as astronomical images that can be used for research,\noutreach or teaching purposes, and is especially relevant to people with a\nvisual disability. We here report the use of 3D printing technology to produce\na representation of the all-sky Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) intensity\nanisotropy maps produced by the Planck mission. The success of this work in\nrepresenting key features of the CMB is discussed as is the potential of this\napproach for representing other astrophysical data sets. 3D printing such\ndatasets represents a highly complementary approach to the usual 2D projections\nused in teaching and outreach work, and can also form the basis of\nundergraduate projects. The CAD files used to produce the models discussed in\nthis paper are made available.\n", "  As an alternative to atomistic calculations of long-wavelength acoustic modes\nof atomically thin layers, which are known to converge very slowly, we propose\na quantitatively predictive and physically intuitive approach based on\ncontinuum elasticity theory. We describe a layer, independent of its thickness,\nby a membrane, characterize its elastic behavior by a $(3{\\times}3)$ elastic\nmatrix as well as the flexural rigidity. We present simple quantitative\nexpressions for frequencies of long-wavelength acoustic modes, which we\ndetermine using 2D elastic constants calculated by {\\em ab initio} Density\nFunctional Theory. The calculated spectra accurately reproduce observed and\ncalculated long-wavelength phonon spectra of graphene and phosphorene, the\nmonolayer of black phosphorus. Our approach also correctly describes the\nobserved dependence of the radial breathing mode frequency on the diameter of\ncarbon fullerenes and nanotubes.\n", "  The $^{22}$Ne(p,$\\gamma$)$^{23}$Na reaction is the most uncertain process in\nthe neon-sodium cycle of hydrogen burning. At temperatures relevant for\nnucleosynthesis in asymptotic giant branch stars and classical novae, its\nuncertainty is mainly due to a large number of predicted but hitherto\nunobserved resonances at low energy. Purpose: A new direct study of low energy\n$^{22}$Ne(p,$\\gamma$)$^{23}$Na resonances has been performed at the Laboratory\nfor Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA), in the Gran Sasso National\nLaboratory, Italy. Method: The proton capture on $^{22}$Ne was investigated in\ndirect kinematics, delivering an intense proton beam to a $^{22}$Ne gas target.\n$\\gamma$ rays were detected with two high-purity germanium detectors enclosed\nin a copper and lead shielding suppressing environmental radioactivity.\nResults: Three resonances at 156.2 keV ($\\omega\\gamma$ =\n(1.48\\,$\\pm$\\,0.10)\\,$\\cdot$\\,10$^{-7}$ eV), 189.5 keV ($\\omega\\gamma$ =\n(1.87\\,$\\pm$\\,0.06)\\,$\\cdot$\\,10$^{-6}$ eV) and 259.7 keV ($\\omega\\gamma$ =\n(6.89\\,$\\pm$\\,0.16)\\,$\\cdot$\\,10$^{-6}$ eV) proton beam energy, respectively,\nhave been observed for the first time. For the levels at 8943.5, 8975.3, and\n9042.4 keV excitation energy corresponding to the new resonances, the\n$\\gamma$-decay branching ratios have been precisely measured. Three additional,\ntentative resonances at 71, 105 and 215 keV proton beam energy, respectively,\nwere not observed here. For the strengths of these resonances, experimental\nupper limits have been derived that are significantly more stringent than the\nupper limits reported in the literature. Conclusions: Based on the present\nexperimental data and also previous literature data, an updated thermonuclear\nreaction rate is provided in tabular and parametric form. The new reaction rate\nis significantly higher than previous evaluations at temperatures of 0.08-0.3\nGK.\n", "  Adaptive Molecular Resolution approaches in Molecular Dynamics are becoming\nrelevant tools for the analysis of molecular liquids characterized by the\ninterplay of different physical scales. The essential difference among these\nmethods is in the way the change of molecular resolution is made in a\nbuffer/transition region. In particular a central question concerns the\npossibility of the existence of a global Hamiltonian which, by describing the\nchange of resolution, is at the same time physically consistent, mathematically\nwell defined and numerically accurate. In this paper we present an asymptotic\nanalysis of the adaptive process complemented by numerical results and show\nthat under certain mathematical conditions a Hamiltonian, which is physically\nconsistent and numerically accurate, may exist. Such conditions show that\nmolecular simulations in the current computational implementation require\nsystems of large size and thus a Hamiltonian approach as the one proposed, at\nthis stage, would not be practical from the numerical point of view. However,\nthe Hamiltonian proposed provides the basis for a simplification and\ngeneralization of the numerical implementation of adaptive resolution\nalgorithms to other molecular dynamics codes.\n", "  The answer to this question is no. In fact, in addition to the solution first\nobtained by Christiaan Huygens in 1658, given by the cycloid, we show that\nthere is an infinite number of tautochrone curves. With this goal, we start by\nbriefly reviewing an the problem of finding out the possible potential energies\nthat lead to periodic motions of a particle whose period is a given function of\nits mechanical energy. There are infinitely many solutions, called sheared\npotentials. As an interesting example, we show that a P\\\"oschl-Teller and the\none-dimensional Morse potentials are sheared relative to one another for\nnegative energies, clarifying why they share the same periods of oscillations\nfor their bounded solutions. We then consider periodic motions of a particle\nsliding without friction over a track around its minimum under the influence of\nan uniform gravitational field. After a brief historical survey of the\ntautochrone problem we show that, given the period of oscillations, there is an\ninfinity of tracks which lead to the same periods. As a bonus, we show that\nthere are infinitely many tautochrones.\n", "  Investigating how formamide forms in the interstellar medium is a hot topic\nin astrochemistry, which can contribute to our understanding of the origin of\nlife on Earth. We have constructed a QM/MM model to simulate the hydrogenation\nof isocyanic acid on amorphous solid water surfaces to form formamide. The\nbinding energy of HNCO on the ASW surface varies significantly between\ndifferent binding sites, we found values between $\\sim$0 and 100 kJ mol$^{-1}$.\nThe barrier for the hydrogenation reaction is almost independent of the binding\nenergy, though. We calculated tunneling rate constants of H + HNCO\n$\\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CO at temperatures down to 103 K combining QM/MM with\ninstanton theory. Tunneling dominates the reaction at such low temperatures.\nThe tunneling reaction is hardly accelerated by the amorphous solid water\nsurface compared to the gas phase for this system, even though the activation\nenergy of the surface reaction is lower than the one of the gas-phase reaction.\nBoth the height and width of the barrier affect the tunneling rate in practice.\nStrong kinetic isotope effects were observed by comparing to rate constants of\nD + HNCO $\\rightarrow$ NHDCO. At 103 K we found a KIE of 231 on the surface and\n146 in the gas phase. Furthermore, we investigated the gas-phase reaction\nNH$_2$ + H$_2$CO $\\rightarrow$ NH$_2$CHO + H and found it unlikely to occur at\ncryogenic temperatures. The data of our tunneling rate constants are expected\nto significantly influence astrochemical models.\n", "  We extend our recent work [Y. Endo et. al., Phys. Rev. 92, 023610 (2015)] for\na parity-mixing effect in a model two-dimensional lattice fermions to a\nrealistic three-dimensional ultracold Fermi gas. Including effects of broken\nlocal spatial inversion symmetry by a trap potential within the framework of\nthe real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory at $T=0$, we point out that an\nodd-parity $p$-wave Cooper-pair amplitude is expected to have already been\nrealized in previous experiments on an (even-parity) $s$-wave superfluid Fermi\ngas with spin imbalance. This indicates that, when one suddenly changes the\n$s$-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate $p$-wave one by using a Feshbach\ntechnique in this case, a non-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter is\nimmediately obtained, which is given by the product of the $p$-wave interaction\nand the $p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the\nspin-imbalanced $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas. Thus, by definition, the system\nis in the $p$-wave superfluid state, at least just after this manipulation.\nSince the achievement of a $p$-wave superfluid state is one of the most\nexciting challenges in cold Fermi gas physics, our results may provide an\nalternative approach to this unconventional pairing state. In addition, since\nthe parity-mixing effect cannot be explained as far as one deals with a trap\npotential in the local density approximation (LDA), it is considered as a\ncrucial example which requires us to go beyond LDA.\n", "  In this paper, we study the electromagnetic effects on stability of\nspherically symmetric anisotropic fluid distribution satisfying two polytropic\nequations of state and construct the corresponding generalized Tolman\nOppenheimer Volkoff equations. We apply perturbations on matter variables via\npolytropic constant as well as polytropic index and formulate the force\ndistribution function. It is found that the compact object is stable for\nfeasible choice of perturbed polytropic index in the presence of charge.\n", "  In 2005 we suggested a relation between the optimal locus of gas giant planet\nformation, prior to migration, and the metallicity of the host star, based on\nthe core accretion model and radial profiles of dust surface density and gas\ntemperature. At that time, less than two hundred extrasolar planets were known,\nlimiting the scope of our analysis. Here we take into account the expanded\nstatistics allowed by new discoveries, in order to check the validity of some\npremises. We compare predictions with the present available data and results\nfor different stellar mass ranges. We find that the Zero Age Planetary Orbit\n(ZAPO) hypothesis continues to hold after a one order of magnitude increase in\ndiscovered planets. In particular, the prediction that metal poor stars harbor\nplanets with an average radius distinctively lower than metal rich ones is\nstill evident in the statistics, and cannot be explained away by chaotic\nplanetary formation mechanisms involving migration and gravitational\ninteraction between planets. The ZAPO hypothesis predicts that in metal poor\nstars the planets are formed nearer their host stars; as a consequence, they\nare more frequently engulfed by the stars during the migration process or\nstripped of their gaseous envelops. The depleted number of gas giant planets\naround metal poor stars would then be the result of the synergy between low\nformation probability, as predicted by the core accretion model, and high\ndestruction probability, for the ones that are formed.\n", "  In this paper we study cosmological signatures of modified gravity theories\nthat can be written as a coupling between a extra scalar field and the\nelectromagnetic part of the usual Lagrangian for the matter fields. In these\nframeworks all the electromagnetic sector of the theory is affected and\nvariations of fundamental constants, of the cosmic distance duality relation\nand of the evolution law of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) are\nexpected and are related each other. In order to search these variations we\nperform jointly analyses with angular diameter distances of galaxy clusters,\nluminosity distances of type Ia supernovae and $T_{CMB}(z)$ measurements. We\nobtain tight constraints with no indication of violation of the standard\nframework.\n", "  Baryogenesis driven by curvature effects is investigated by taking into\naccount gravitationally induced particle production in the very early Universe.\nIn our scenario, the baryon asymmetry is generated dynamically during an\ninflationary epoch powered by ultra-relativistic particles. The adiabatic\nparticle production rate provides both the needed negative pressure to\naccelerate the radiation dominated Universe and a non-zero chemical potential\nwhich distinguishes baryons and anti-baryons thereby producing a baryon\nasymmetry in agreement with the observed value. Reciprocally, the present day\nasymmetry may be used to determine the inflationary scale at early times.\nSuccessful gravitational baryogenesis is dynamically generated for many\ndifferent choices of the relevant model parameters.\n", "  Blazars radiate from radio through gamma-ray frequencies thereby being ideal\ntargets for multifrequency studies. Such studies allow constraining the\nproperties of the emitting jet. 3C 279 is among the most notable blazars and\ntherefore subject to extensive multifrequency campaigns. We report the results\nof a campaign ranging from near-IR to gamma-ray energies of an outburst of 3C\n279 in June 2015. The overall spectral energy distribution from near-IR to\ngamma rays can be well represented by either a leptonic or a lepto-hadronic\nradiation transfer model. Even though the data are equally well represented by\nthe two models, their inferred parameters challenge the physical conditions in\nthe jet. In fact, the leptonic model requires parameters with a magnetic field\nfar below equipartition with the relativistic particle energy density. On the\ncontrary, equipartition may be achieved with the lepto-hadronic model, which\nhowever implies an extreme total jet power close to Eddington luminosity.\n", "  We demonstrate that simultaneous application of optical clearing agents\n(OCAs) and complex wavefront shaping in optical coherence tomography (OCT) can\nprovide significant enhancement of the penetration depth and imaging quality.\nOCA reduces optical inhomogeneity of a highly scattering sample, and the\nwavefront shaping of illumination light controls multiple scattering, resulting\nin an enhancement of the penetration depth and signal-to-noise ratio. A tissue\nphantom study shows that concurrent applications of OCA and wavefront shaping\nsuccessfully operate in OCT imaging. The penetration depth enhancement is\nfurther demonstrated for ex vivo mouse ears, revealing hidden structures\ninaccessible with conventional OCT imaging.\n", "  The paper examines the prospects of using laser plasmas for studying novel\nregimes of the magnetic field line reconnection and charged particle\nacceleration. Basic features of plasma dynamics in the three-dimensional\nconfigurations relevant to the formation of current sheets in a plasma are\naddressed by analyzing exact self-similar solutions of the\nmagneto-hydrodynamics and electron magneto-hydrodynamics equations. Then the\nmagnetic field annihilation in the ultrarelativistic limit is considered, when\nthe opposite polarity magnetic field is generated in collisionless plasma by\nmultiple laser pulses, in the regime with a dominant contribution of the\ndisplacement current exciting a strong large-scale electric field. This field\nleads to the conversion of the magnetic energy into the kinetic energy of\naccelerated particles inside a thin current sheet. Charged particle\nacceleration during magnetic field reconnection is discussed when radiation\nfriction and quantum electrodynamics effects become dominant.\n", "  An exterior complex scaling technique is applied to compute Stark resonance\nparameters for two molecular orbitals ($1b_{1}$ and $1b_{2}$) represented in\nthe field-free limit in a single-center expansion. For electric DC field\nconfigurations that guarantee azimuthal symmetry of the solution the\ncalculation is carried out by solving a two-dimensional partial differential\nequation in spherical polar coordinates using a finite-element method. The\nresonance positions and widths as a function of electric field strengths are\nshown for field strengths starting in the tunnelling ionization regime, and\nextending well into the over-barrier ionization region.\n", "  The possibility of self-trapped propagation of electromagnetic beams in the\nfully degenerate relativistic electron-positron plasma has been studied\napplying Fluid-Maxwell model; it is shown that dynamics of such beams can be\ndescribed by the generalized Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with specific\ntype of saturating nonlinearity. Existence of radially symmetric localized\nsolitary structures is demonstrated. It is found that stable solitary\nstructures exist for the arbitrary level of degeneracy.\n", "  In preparation of future Multi-Object Spectrographs (MOS) whose one of the\nmajor role is to provide an extensive statistical studies of high redshifted\ngalaxies surveyed, the demonstrator Canary has been designed to tackle\ntechnical challenges related to open-loop Adaptive-Optics (AO) control with\njointed Natural Guide Star (NGS) and Laser Guide Star (LGS) tomography. We have\ndeveloped a Point Spread Function (PSF)-Reconstruction algorithm dedicated to\nMOAO systems using system telemetry to estimate the PSF potentially anywhere in\nthe observed field, a prerequisite to post- process AO-corrected observations\nin Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS). In this paper we show how to handle\noff-axis data to estimate the PSF using atmospheric tomography and compare it\nto a classical approach that uses on-axis residual phase from a truth sensor\nobserving a natural bright source. We have reconstructed over 450 on-sky Canary\nPSFs and we get bias/1-${\\sigma}$ standard-deviation (std) of 1.3/4.8 on the\nH-band Strehl ratio (SR) with 92.3% of correlation between reconstructed and\nsky SR. On the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), we get respectively 2.94 mas,\n19.9 mas and 88.3% for the bias, std and correlation. The reference method\nachieves 0.4/3.5/95% on the SR and 2.71 mas/14.9 mas/92.5% on the FWHM for the\nbias/std/correlation.\n", "  A kinetic equation for a dilute gas of hard spheres confined between two\nparallel plates separated a distance smaller than two particle dimeters is\nderived. It is a Boltzmann-like equation, which incorporates the effect of the\nconfinement on the particle collisions. A function $S(t)$ is constructed by\nadding to the Boltzmann expression a confinement contribution. Then it is shown\nthat for the solutions of the kinetic equation, $S(t)$ increases monotonically\nin time, until the system reaches a stationary inhomogeneous state, when $S$\nbecomes the equilibrium entropy of the confined system as derived from\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. From the entropy, other equilibrium\nproperties are obtained, and Molecular Dynamics simulations are used to verify\nsome of the theoretical predictions.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the galaxy rotation curves using a density profile\nthat comes from noncommutativity (NC) theory. We will refer to this\ndistribution as NC density. In this case, we use the Einasto's density profile\nas a reference due that it is a generalized case of NC distribution and is one\nof the most successful phenomenological profiles to describe the rotation curve\nof galaxies. Based on these results, we open a discussion if Einasto's profile\ncould be used as an extension of NC density and if could be applied to other\nstudies treated by this theory.\n"]}
