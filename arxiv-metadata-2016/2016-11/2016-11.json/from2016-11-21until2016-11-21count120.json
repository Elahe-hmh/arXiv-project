The measurements are carried out using a novel scheme to\nintegrate the two-way coupling between the particle and the incompressible\nsurrounding fluid flow maintained in a high-Reynolds-number turbulent regime.\nThe main idea consists in combining a Fourier pseudo-spectral method for the\nfluid with an immersed-boundary technique to impose the no-slip boundary\ncondition on the surface of the particle. Benchmarking of the code shows a good\nagreement with experimental and numerical measurements from other groups. A\nstudy of the turbulent wake downstream the sphere is also reported. The mean\nvelocity deficit is shown to behave as the inverse of the distance from the\nparticle, as predicted from classical similarity analysis. This law is\nreinterpreted in terms of the principle of \"permanence of large eddies\" that\nrelates infrared asymptotic self-similarity to the law of decay of energy in\nhomogeneous turbulence.\n  The developed method is then used to attack the problem of an upstream flow\nthat is in a developed turbulent regime. It is shown that the average drag\nforce increases as a function of the turbulent intensity and the particle\nReynolds number. This increase is significantly larger than predicted by\nstandard drag correlations based on laminar upstream flows. It is found that\nthe relevant parameter is the ratio of the viscous boundary layer thickness to\nthe dissipation scale of the ambient turbulent flow. The drag enhancement can\nbe motivated by the modification of the mean velocity and pressure profile\naround the sphere by small scale turbulent fluctuations.\n", "  We study stationary solutions of the damped wave equation on a compact and\nsmooth Riemannian manifold without boundary. In the high frequency limit, we\nprove that a sequence of $\\beta$-damped stationary solutions cannot be\ncompletely concentrated in small neighborhoods of a small fixed hyperbolic\nsubset made of $\\beta$-damped trajectories of the geodesic flow. The article\nalso includes an appendix (by S. Nonnenmacher and the author) where we\nestablish the existence of an inverse logarithmic strip without eigenvalues\nbelow the real axis, under a pressure condition on the set of undamped\ntrajectories.\n", "  The rotation of a black hole splits its spectrum in two, yet only one sector\nis known in the highly-damped regime. We find the second, at least partly\noblate sector, with quasinormal modes approaching the total reflection\nfrequencies \\omega(n>>1) ~ m\\Omega - 2\\pi iT(n-s), where \\Omega and T are the\nhorizon angular velocity and temperature, s is the field spin, and m is an\nazimuthal eigenvalue. Some physical implications are discussed.\n", "  We present, and mathematically describe, a proof-of-principle quantum-optical\nexperiment that seemingly enables superluminal signaling, contrary to the\nimport of the 'no-signaling' theorem.\n", "  By means of numerical simulations, we explore possible effects of a special\ninterparticle interaction potential which is a function of external and\ninternal conditions of graphene-like systems. In addition to the\nelectromagnetic interaction, we introduce a new potential due to the exchange\nof a massive scalar, associated to the so-called Kekul\\'e deformations; this\ninteraction displays a spin-dependent profile. It turns out that the magnitude\nof Kekul\\'e deformation may significantly affect physical properties of\ngraphene. A Monte Carlo analysis enables one to analyze the behavior of the\nsystem under variation of the applied external field, temperature, and the\nparticular type of the exchanged excitation that induces the potential. We\npursue an investigation of the spin configurations, we analyze differences in\nthermal equilibrium magnetization and we carry out calculations of the magnetic\nsusceptibility and the specific heat in the presence of the Kekul\\'e-induced\nnew potential.\n", "  In this work we analyze the simultaneous emergence of diffusive energy\ntransport and local thermalization in a nonequilibrium one-dimensional quantum\nsystem, as a result of integrability breaking. Specifically, we discuss the\nlocal properties of the steady state induced by thermal boundary driving in a\nXXZ spin chain with staggered magnetic field. By means of efficient large-scale\nmatrix product simulations of the equation of motion of the system, we\ncalculate its steady state in the long-time limit.We start by discussing the\nenergy transport supported by the system, finding it to be ballistic in the\nintegrable limit and diffusive when the staggered field is finite.\nSubsequently, we examine the reduced density operators of neighboring sites and\nfind that for large systems they are well approximated by local thermal states\nof the underlying Hamiltonian in the nonintegrable regime, even for weak\nstaggered fields. In the integrable limit, on the other hand, this behavior is\nlost, and the identification of local temperatures is no longer possible. Our\nresults agree with the intuitive connection between energy diffusion and\nthermalization.\n", "  CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O ${\\it J}$ = 3--2 observations are presented of\nthe Ophiuchus molecular cloud. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emission is\ndominated by the Oph A clump, and the Oph B1, B2, C, E, F and J regions. The\noptically thin(ner) C$^{18}$O line is used as a column density tracer, from\nwhich the gravitational binding energy is estimated to be $4.5 \\times 10^{39}$\nJ (2282 $M_\\odot$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$). The turbulent kinetic energy is $6.3 \\times\n10^{38}$ J (320 $M_\\odot$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$), or 7 times less than this, and\ntherefore the Oph cloud as a whole is gravitationally bound. Thirty protostars\nwere searched for high velocity gas, with eight showing outflows, and twenty\nmore having evidence of high velocity gas along their lines-of-sight. The total\noutflow kinetic energy is $1.3 \\times 10^{38}$ J (67 $M_\\odot$ km$^2$\ns$^{-2}$), corresponding to 21$\\%$ of the cloud's turbulent kinetic energy.\nAlthough turbulent injection by outflows is significant, but does ${\\it not}$\nappear to be the dominant source of turbulence in the cloud. 105 dense\nmolecular clumplets were identified, which had radii $\\sim$ 0.01--0.05 pc,\nvirial masses $\\sim$ 0.1--12 $M_\\odot$, luminosities $\\sim$ 0.001--0.1 K~km\ns$^{-1}$ pc$^{-2}$, and excitation temperatures $\\sim$ 10--50K. These are\nconsistent with the standard GMC based size-line width relationships, showing\nthat the scaling laws extend down to size scales of hundredths of a parsec, and\nto sub solar-mass condensations. There is however no compelling evidence that\nthe majority of clumplets are undergoing free-fall collapse, nor that they are\npressure confined.\n", "  We develop a topological theory for disordered Weyl semimetals in the\nframework of gauge invariance of replica formalism and boundary-bulk\ncorrespondence of Chern insulators. An anisotropic topological $\\theta$-term is\nanalytically derived for the effective non-linear sigma model. It is this\nnontrivial topological term that ensures the bulk transverse transport of Weyl\nsemimetals to be robust against disorders. Moreover, we establish a general\ndiagram that reveals the intrinsic relations among topological terms in the\nnon-linear sigma models and gauge response theories respectively for $(2n +\n2)$-dimensional topological insulators, $(2n+1)$-dimensional chiral fermions,\n$(2n+1)$-dimensional chiral semimetals, and $(2n)$-dimensional topological\ninsulators with $n$ being a positive integer.\n", "  From the effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation in the CPT-even gauge\nsector of Standard Model Extension, we establish a possible scenario where an\nanalogue of the He-McKellar-Wilkens effect can stem from. Besides, we build\nquantum holonomies associated with the analogue of the He-McKellar-Wilkens\neffect and discuss a possible analogy with the holonomic quantum computation\n[P. Zanardi and M. Rasetti, Phys. Lett. A {\\bf264}, 94 (1999)]. Finally, we\ninvestigate the dependence of the energy levels on the He-McKellar-Wilkens\ngeometric phase induced by Lorentz symmetry breaking effects when the particle\nis confined to a hard-wall confining potential.\n", "  We review the physics of relativistic shocks, which are often invoked as the\nsources of non-thermal particles in pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets, and as possible sources\nof ultra-high energy cosmic-rays. We focus on particle acceleration and\nmagnetic field generation, and describe the recent progress in the field driven\nby theory advances and by the rapid development of particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations. In weakly magnetized or quasi parallel-shocks (where the magnetic\nfield is nearly aligned with the flow), particle acceleration is efficient. The\naccelerated particles stream ahead of the shock, where they generate strong\nmagnetic waves which in turn scatter the particles back and forth across the\nshock, mediating their acceleration. In contrast, in strongly magnetized\nquasi-perpendicular shocks, the efficiencies of both particle acceleration and\nmagnetic field generation are suppressed. Particle acceleration, when\nefficient, modifies the turbulence around the shock on a long time scale, and\nthe accelerated particles have a characteristic energy spectral index of ~ 2.2\nin the ultra-relativistic limit. We discuss how this novel understanding of\nparticle acceleration and magnetic field generation in relativistic shocks can\nbe applied to high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with an emphasis on PWNe and\nGRB afterglows.\n", "  In this work, we study systems composed of a $\\rho/\\omega$ and $B^*$ meson\npair. We find three bound states in isospin, spin-parity channels $(1/2, 0^+)$,\n$(1/2, 1^+)$ and $(1/2, 2^+)$. The state with $J=2$ can be a good candidate for\nthe $B_2^*(5747)$. We also study the $\\rho B$ system, and a bound state with\nmass $5728$ MeV and width around $20$ MeV is obtained, which can be identified\nwith the $B_1(5721)$ resonance. In the case of $I=3/2$, one obtains repulsion\nand thus, no exotic (molecular) mesons in this sector are generated in the\napproach.\n", "  A critical ingredient for realizing large-scale quantum information\nprocessors will be the ability to make economical use of qubit control\nhardware. We demonstrate an extensible strategy for reusing control hardware on\nsame-frequency transmon qubits in a circuit QED chip with\nsurface-code-compatible connectivity. A vector switch matrix enables selective\nbroadcasting of input pulses to multiple transmons with individual tailoring of\npulse quadratures for each, as required to minimize the effects of leakage on\nweakly anharmonic qubits. Using randomized benchmarking, we compare multiple\nbroadcasting strategies that each pass the surface-code error threshold for\nsingle-qubit gates. In particular, we introduce a selective-broadcasting\ncontrol strategy using five pulse primitives, which allows independent,\nsimultaneous Clifford gates on arbitrary numbers of qubits.\n", "  Hydrogen recombination in the early Universe in the presence of a magnetic\nfield is studied. An equation for the temperature of recombination in the\npresence of a magnetic field is derived. Limiting cases of weak and strong\nfields are considered. It is demonstrated that there exists a critical magnetic\nfield, above which the system stays in the phase of atomic hydrogen for all\ntemperatures. The relative shift of the temperature of recombination in the\npresence of a magnetic field is estimated and it is demonstrated that this\nshift is small.\n", "  We consider the stationary metrics that have both the black hole and the\nergoregion. The class of such metric contains, in particular, the Kerr metric.\nWe study the Cauchy problem with highly oscillatory initial data supported in a\nneighborhood inside the ergoregion with some initial energy $E_0$. We prove\nthat when the time variable $x_0$ increases this solution splits into two\nparts: one with the negative energy $-E_1$ ending at the event horizon in a\nfinite time, and the second part, with the energy $E_2=E_0+E_1>E_0$, escaping,\nunder some conditions, to the infinity when $x_0\\rightarrow +\\infty$. Thus we\nget the superradiance phenomenon. In the case of the Kerr metric the\nsuperradiance phenomenon is \"short-lived\", since both the solutions with\npositive and negative energies cross the outer event horizon in a finite time\n(modulo $O(\\frac{1}{k})$) where $k$ is a large parameter. We show that these\nsolutions end on the singularity ring in a finite time. We study also the case\nof naked singularity.\n", "  Activity in the brain propagates as waves of firing neurons, namely\navalanches. These waves' size and duration distributions have been\nexperimentally shown to display a stable power-law profile, long-range\ncorrelations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum \\textit{in vivo} and \\textit{in\nvitro}. We study an avalanching biologically motivated model of mammals visual\ncortex and find an extended critical-like region -- a Griffiths phase --\ncharacterized by divergent susceptibility and zero order parameter. This phase\nlies close to the expected experimental value of the \\textit{excitatory\npostsynaptic potential} in the cortex suggesting that critical behavior may be\nfound in the visual system. Avalanches are not perfectly power-law distributed,\nbut it is possible to collapse the distributions and define a cutoff avalanche\nsize that diverges as the network size is increased inside the critical region.\nThe avalanches present long-range correlations and $1/f^{b}$ power spectrum,\nmatching experiments. The phase transition is analytically determined by a\nmean-field approximation.\n", "  We study a new biologically motivated model for the Macaque monkey primary\nvisual cortex which presents power-law avalanches after a visual stimulus. The\nsignal propagates through all the layers of the model via avalanches that\ndepend on network structure and synaptic parameter. We identify four different\navalanche profiles as a function of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The\navalanches follow a size-duration scaling relation and present critical\nexponents that match experiments. The structure of the network gives rise to a\nregime of two characteristic spatial scales, one of which vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  In this work we study the $\\rho B^*\\bar{B}^*$ three-body system solving the\nFaddeev equations in the fixed center approximation. We assume the\n$B^*\\bar{B}^*$ system forming a cluster, and in terms of the two-body $\\rho\nB^*$ unitarized scattering amplitudes in the local Hidden Gauge approach we\nfind a new $I(J^{PC})=1(3^{--})$ state. The mass of the new state corresponds\nto a two particle invariant mass of the $\\rho B^\\ast$ system close to the\nresonant energy of the $B^\\ast_2(5747)$, indicating that the role of this $J=2$\nresonance is important in the dynamical generation of the new state.\n", "  Neutrino beam facilities, like spallation neutron facilities, produce copious\nquantities of neutrinos from the decay at rest of mesons and muons. The\nviability of decay-in-flight neutrino beams as sites for decay-at-rest neutrino\nstudies has been investigated by calculating expected low-energy neutrino\nfluxes from the existing Fermilab NuMI beam facility. Decay-at-rest neutrino\nproduction in NuMI is found to be roughly equivalent per megawatt to that of\nspallation facilities, and is concentrated in the facility's target hall and\nbeam stop regions. Interaction rates in 5 and 60 ton liquid argon detectors at\na variety of existing and hypothetical locations along the beamline are found\nto be comparable to the largest existing decay-at-rest datasets for some\nchannels. The physics implications and experimental challenges of such a\nmeasurement are discussed, along with prospects for measurements at targeted\nfacilities along a future Fermilab long-baseline neutrino beam.\n", "  Since the early work by Ashkin in 1970, optical trapping has become one of\nthe most powerful tools for manipulating small particles, such as micron sized\nbeads or single atoms. The optical trapping mechanism is based on the\ninteraction energy of a dipole and the electric field of the laser light. In\natom trapping, the dominant contribution typically comes from the allowed\noptical transition closest to the laser wavelength, whereas for mesoscopic\nparticles it is given by the bulk polarizability of the material. These two\ndifferent regimes of optical trapping have coexisted for decades without any\ndirect link, resulting in two very different contexts of applications: one\nbeing the trapping of small objects mainly in biological settings, the other\none being dipole traps for individual neutral atoms in the field of quantum\noptics. Here we show that for nanoscale diamond crystals containing artificial\natoms, so-called nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers, both regimes of optical\ntrapping can be observed at the same time even in a noisy liquid environment.\nFor wavelengths in the vicinity of the zero-phonon line transition of the color\ncenters, we observe a significant modification ($10\\%$) of the overall trapping\nstrength. Most remarkably, our experimental findings suggest that owing to the\nlarge number of artificial atoms, collective effects greatly contribute to the\nobserved trapping strength modification. Our approach adds the powerful\natomic-physics toolbox to the field of nano-manipulation.\n", "  Quantum computers are poised to radically outperform their classical\ncounterparts by manipulating coherent quantum systems. A realistic quantum\ncomputer will experience errors due to the environment and imperfect control.\nWhen these errors are even partially coherent, they present a major obstacle to\nachieving robust computation. Here, we propose a method for introducing\nindependent random single-qubit gates into the logical circuit in such a way\nthat the effective logical circuit remains unchanged. We prove that this\nrandomization tailors the noise into stochastic Pauli errors, leading to\ndramatic reductions in worst-case and cumulative error rates, while introducing\nlittle or no experimental overhead. Moreover we prove that our technique is\nrobust to variation in the errors over the gate sets and numerically illustrate\nthe dramatic reductions in worst-case error that are achievable. Given such\ntailored noise, gates with significantly lower fidelity are sufficient to\nachieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, and, importantly, the worst case\nerror rate of the tailored noise can be directly and efficiently measured\nthrough randomized benchmarking experiments. Remarkably, our method enables the\nrealization of fault-tolerant quantum computation under the error rates\nobserved in recent experiments.\n", "  The complex scaling method (CSM) provides with a way to obtain resonance\nparameters of particle unstable states by rotating the coordinates and momenta\nof the original Hamiltonian. It is convenient to use an L$^2$ integrable basis\nto resolve the complex rotated or complex scaled Hamiltonian H$_{\\theta}$, with\n$\\theta$ being the angle of rotation in the complex energy plane. Within the\nCSM, resonance and scattering solutions do not exhibit an outgoing or\nscattering wave asymptotic behavior, but rather have decaying asymptotics. One\nof the consequences is that, expectation values of operators in a resonance or\nscattering complex scaled solution are calculated by complex rotating the\noperators. In this work we are exploring applications of the CSM on\ncalculations of expectation values of quantum mechanical operators by\nretrieving the Gamow asymptotic character of the decaying state and calculating\nhence the expectation value using the unrotated operator. The test cases\ninvolve a schematic two-body Gaussian model and also applications using\nrealistic interactions.\n", "  Age dependent population dynamics are frequently modeled with generalizations\nof the classic McKendrick-von Foerster equation. These are deterministic\nsystems, and a stochastic generalization was recently reported in [1,2]. Here\nwe develop a fully stochastic theory for age-structured populations via quantum\nfield theoretical Doi-Peliti techniques. This results in a path integral\nformulation where birth and death events correspond to cubic and quadratic\ninteraction terms. This formalism allows us to efficiently recapitulate the\nresults in [1,2], exemplifying the utility of Doi-Peliti methods. Furthermore,\nwe find that the path integral formulation for age-structured moments has an\nexact perturbative expansion that explicitly relates to the hereditary\nstructure between correlated individuals. These methods are then generalized\nwith a binary fission model of cell division.\n", "  In the $pp \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ process the angular distributions of top and\nanti-top quarks are expected to present a subtle difference, which could be\nenhanced by processes not included in the Standard Model. This Letter presents\na measurement of the charge asymmetry in events where the top-quark pair is\nproduced with a large invariant mass. The analysis is performed on 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the LHC, using reconstruction techniques specifically designed\nfor the decay topology of highly boosted top quarks. The charge asymmetry in a\nfiducial region with large invariant mass of the top-quark pair ($m_{t\\bar{t}}\n> $ 0.75 TeV) and an absolute rapidity difference of the top and anti-top quark\ncandidates within $-$2 $ < |y_t| - |y_{\\bar{t}}| <$ 2 is measured to be 4.2\n$\\pm$ 3.2%, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading\norder. A differential measurement in three $t\\bar{t}$ mass bins is also\npresented.\n", "  We discuss a method for determination of the size of the emitting region\nclose to the compact star in a binary system with eclipses by a secondary,\nwhich fills its Roche lobe. The often used approach is to model the Roche lobe\nby a sphere with the \"effective radius\" corresponding to the volume of the\nRoche lobe. This approach leads to a 4-6% overestimate of the radius, if taking\ninto account the angular dimensions of the Roche lobe seen form the compact\nstar. Andronov (1992) had shown that the projection of the Roche lobe onto the\ncelestial sphere is close to an ellipse and had tabulated these dimensions as a\nfunction of the mass ratio. Also he published the coefficients of the\napproximation similar to that of the Eggleton (1983) for the \"sphere\ncorresponding to the same volume\". We compare results obtained for the\n\"circle+circle\", \"ellipse+circle\" and \"ellipse+point\" approximations of the\nprojections of the red dwarf and a white dwarf, respectively. Results are\napplied to the recently discovered eclipsing polar CSS 081231:071126+440405.\n", "  We derive the Do and Norbury recursion formula for the one-loop mean of an\nirregular spectral curve from a variant of replica method by Brez\\'in and\nHikami. We express this recursion in special times in which all terms\n$W_1^{(g)}$ of the genus expansion of the one-loop mean are polynomials. We\nfind a generalization of this recursion to the generalized Laguerre polynomial\ncase.\n", "  Lattice systems and discrete networks with dissipative interactions are\nsuccessfully employed as meso-scale models of heterogeneous solids. As the\napplication scale generally is much larger than that of the discrete links,\nphysically relevant simulations are computationally expensive. The\nQuasiContinuum (QC) method is a multiscale approach that reduces the\ncomputational cost of direct numerical simulations by fully resolving complex\nphenomena only in regions of interest while coarsening elsewhere. In previous\nwork (Beex et al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids 64, 154-169, 2014), the originally\nconservative QC methodology was generalized to a virtual-power-based QC\napproach that includes local dissipative mechanisms. In this contribution, the\nvirtual-power-based QC method is reformulated from a variational point of view,\nby employing the energy-based variational framework for rate-independent\nprocesses (Mielke and Roub\\'i\\v{c}ek, Rate-Independent Systems: Theory and\nApplication, Springer-Verlag, 2015). By construction it is shown that the QC\nmethod with dissipative interactions can be expressed as a minimization problem\nof a properly built energy potential, providing solutions equivalent to those\nof the virtual-power-based QC formulation. The theoretical considerations are\ndemonstrated on three simple examples. For them we verify energy consistency,\nquantify relative errors in energies, and discuss errors in internal variables\nobtained for different meshes and two summation rules.\n", "  Numerical simulation is an important non-perturbative tool to study quantum\nfield theories defined in non-commutative spaces. In this contribution, a\nselection of results from Monte Carlo calculations for non-commutative models\nis presented, and their implications are reviewed. In addition, we also discuss\nhow related numerical techniques have been recently applied in computer\nsimulations of dimensionally reduced supersymmetric theories.\n", "  The unusual magnetic materials are significant in both science and\ntechnology. However, because of the strongly correlated effects, it is\ndifficult to understand their novel properties from theoretical aspects.\nHolographic duality offers a new approach to understanding such systems from\ngravity side. This paper will give a brief review of our recent works on the\napplications of holographic duality in understanding unusual magnetic\nmaterials. Some quantitative compare between holographic results and\nexperimental data will be shown and some predictions from holographic duality\nmodels will be discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we elaborate over the well-known interpretability issue in\necho state networks. The idea is to investigate the dynamics of reservoir\nneurons with time-series analysis techniques taken from research on complex\nsystems. Notably, we analyze time-series of neuron activations with Recurrence\nPlots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which permit to\nvisualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that\nthis approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the two-dimensional\nrepresentation offered by RPs provides a way for visualizing the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics of a reservoir. Our results suggest that, if the\nnetwork is stable, reservoir and input denote similar line patterns in the\nrespective RPs. Conversely, the more unstable the ESN, the more the RP of the\nreservoir presents instability patterns. As a second result, we show that the\n$\\mathrm{L_{max}}$ measure is highly correlated with the well-established\nmaximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based\non RP diagonal lines distribution provide a valuable tool to quantify the\ndegree of network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures\nfluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN\ntypically achieves maximum computational capability. We verify that the\ndetermination of the edge of stability provided by such RQA measures is more\naccurate than two well-known criteria based on the Jacobian matrix of the\nreservoir. Therefore, we claim that RPs and RQA-based analyses can be used as\nvaluable tools to design an effective network given a specific problem.\n", "  We measure galaxy sizes on a sample of $\\sim1200$ galaxies with confirmed\nspectroscopic redshifts $2 \\leq z_{spec} \\leq 4.5$ in the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (VUDS), representative of star-forming galaxies with $i_\\mathrm{AB} \\leq\n25$. We first derive galaxy sizes applying a classical parametric profile\nfitting method using GALFIT. We then measure the total pixel area covered by a\ngalaxy above a given surface brightness threshold, which overcomes the\ndifficulty of measuring sizes of galaxies with irregular shapes. We then\ncompare the results obtained for the equivalent circularized radius enclosing\n100\\% of the measured galaxy light $r_T^{100}$ to those obtained with the\neffective radius $r_{e,\\mathrm{circ}}$ measured with GALFIT. We find that the\nsizes of galaxies computed with our non-parametric approach span a large range\nbut remain roughly constant on average with a median value $r_T^{100}\\sim2.2$\nkpc for galaxies with $2<z<4.5$. This is in stark contrast with the strong\ndownward evolution of $r_e$ with increasing redshift, down to sizes of $<1$ kpc\nat $z\\sim4.5$. We analyze the difference and find that parametric fitting of\ncomplex, asymmetric, multi-component galaxies is severely underestimating their\nsizes. By comparing $r_T^{100}$ with physical parameters obtained through SED\nfitting we find that the star-forming galaxies that are the largest at any\nredshift are, on average, more massive and more star-forming. We discover that\ngalaxies present more concentrated light profiles as we move towards higher\nredshifts. We interpret these results as the signature of several, possibly\ndifferent, evolutionary paths of galaxies in their early stages of assembly,\nincluding major and minor merging or star-formation in multiple bright regions.\n(abridged)\n", "  The Higgs mechanism predicts, apart from the existence of a new scalar boson,\nthe presence of a constant Higgs field that permeates all of space. The vacuum\nexpectation value (VEV) of this field is affected by quantum corrections which\nare mainly generated by the self-interactions and couplings of the Higgs field\nto gauge bosons and heavy quarks. In this work we show that gravity can affect,\nin a non-trivial way, these quantum corrections through the finite parts of the\none-loop contributions to the effective potential. In particular, we consider\nthe corrections generated by the Standard Model Higgs self-interactions in\nslowly-varying weak gravitational backgrounds. The obtained results amount to\nthe existence of non-negligible inhomogeneities in the Higgs VEV. Such\ninhomogeneities translate into spatial variations of the particle masses, and\nin particular of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. We find that these Higgs\nperturbations in our Solar System are controlled by the Eddington parameter,\nand are absent in pure General Relativity. Yet, they may be present in modified\ngravity theories. This predicted effect may be constrained by atomic clocks or\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic measurements, which could allow to improve\ncurrent limits on modifications of Einstein's gravity.\n", "  We introduce a method for predicting RNA folding pathways, with an\napplication to the most important RNA tetraloops. The method is based on the\nidea that ensembles of three-dimensional fragments extracted from\nhigh-resolution crystal structures are heterogeneous enough to describe\nmetastable as well as intermediate states. These ensembles are first validated\nby performing a quantitative comparison against available solution NMR data of\na set of RNA tetranucleotides. Notably, the agreement is better with respect to\nthe one obtained by comparing NMR with extensive all-atom molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We then propose a procedure based on diffusion maps and Markov\nmodels that makes it possible to obtain reaction pathways and their relative\nprobabilities from fragment ensembles. This approach is applied to study the\nhelix-to-loop folding pathway of all the tetraloops from the GNRA and UNCG\nfamilies. The results give detailed insights into the folding mechanism that\nare compatible with available experimental data and clarify the role of\nintermediate states observed in previous simulation studies. The method is\ncomputationally inexpensive and can be used to study arbitrary conformational\ntransitions.\n", "  The Wegner $Z_2$ gauge theory-$Z_2$ Ising spin model duality in $(2+1)$\ndimensions is revisited and derived through a series of canonical\ntransformations. The Kramers-Wannier duality is similarly obtained. The Wegner\n$Z_2$ gauge-spin duality is directly generalized to SU(N) lattice gauge theory\nin $(2+1)$ dimensions to obtain the SU(N) spin model in terms of the SU(N)\nmagnetic fields and their conjugate SU(N) electric scalar potentials. The exact\nand complete solutions of the $Z_2, U(1), SU(N)$ Gauss law constraints in terms\nof the corresponding spin or dual potential operators are given. The gauge-spin\nduality naturally leads to a new gauge invariant magnetic disorder operator for\nSU(N) lattice gauge theory which produces a magnetic vortex on the plaquette. A\nvariational ground state of the SU(2) spin model with nearest neighbor\ninteractions is constructed to analyze SU(2) gauge theory.\n", "  We demonstrate a direct mapping of max k-SAT problems (and weighted max\nk-SAT) to a Chimera graph, which is the non-planar hardware graph of the\ndevices built by D-Wave Systems Inc. We further show that this mapping can be\nused to map a similar class of maximum satisfiability problems where the\nclauses are replaced by parity checks over potentially large numbers of bits.\nThe latter is of specific interest for applications in decoding for\ncommunication. We discuss an example in which the decoding of a turbo code,\nwhich has been demonstrated to perform near the Shannon limit, can be mapped to\na Chimera graph. The weighted max k-SAT problem is the most general class of\nsatisfiability problems, so our result effectively demonstrates how any\nsatisfiability problem may be directly mapped to a Chimera graph. Our methods\nfaithfully reproduce the low energy spectrum of the target problems, so\ntherefore may also be used for maximum entropy inference.\n", "  The scenario consistent with a wealth of observations for the missing mass\nproblem is that of weakly interacting dark matter particles. However, arguments\nor proposals for a Newtonian or relativistic modified gravity scenario continue\nto be made. A distinguishing characteristic between the two scenarios is that\ndark matter particles can produce a gravitational effect, in principle, without\nthe need of baryons while this is not the case for the modified gravity\nscenario where such an effect must be correlated with the amount of baryonic\nmatter. We consider here ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies as a promising arena\nto test the two scenarios based on the above assertion. We compare the\ncorrelation of the luminosity with the velocity dispersion between samples of\nUFD and non-UFD galaxies, finding a significant loss of correlation for UFD\ngalaxies. For example, we find for 28 non-UFD galaxies a strong correlation\ncoefficient of -0.688 which drops to -0.077 for the 23 UFD galaxies. Incoming\nand future data will determine whether the observed stochasticity for UFD\ngalaxies is physical or due to systematics in the data. Such a loss of\ncorrelation (if it is to persist) is possible and consistent with the dark\nmatter scenario for UFD galaxies but would constitute a new challenge for the\nmodified gravity scenario.\n", "  One of the outstanding problems in general relativistic cosmology is that of\nthe averaging. That is, how the lumpy universe that we observe at small scales\naverages out to a smooth Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The\nroot of the problem is that averaging does not commute with the Einstein\nequations that govern the dynamics of the model. This leads to the well-know\nquestion of backreaction in cosmology. In this work, we approach the problem\nusing the covariant framework of Macroscopic Gravity (MG). We use its\ncosmological solution with a flat FLRW macroscopic background where the result\nof averaging cosmic inhomogeneities has been encapsulated into a backreaction\ndensity parameter denoted $\\Omega_\\mathcal{A}$. We constrain this averaged\nuniverse using available cosmological data sets of expansion and growth\nincluding, for the first time, a full CMB analysis from Planck temperature\nanisotropy and polarization data, the supernovae data from Union 2.1, the\ngalaxy power spectrum from WiggleZ, the weak lensing tomography shear-shear\ncross correlations from the CFHTLenS survey and the baryonic acoustic\noscillation data from 6Df, SDSS DR7 and BOSS DR9. We find that $-0.0155 \\le\n\\Omega_\\mathcal{A} \\le 0$ (at the 68\\% CL) thus providing a tight upper-bound\non the backreaction term. We also find that the term is strongly correlated\nwith cosmological parameters such $\\Omega_\\Lambda$, $\\sigma_8$ and $H_0$. While\nsmall, a backreaction density parameter of a few percent should be kept in\nconsideration along with other systematics for precision cosmology.\n", "  El Ni\\~no exhibits distinct Eastern Pacific (EP) and Central Pacific (CP)\ntypes which are commonly, but not always consistently, distinguished from each\nother by different signatures in equatorial climate variability. Here, we\npropose an index based on evolving climate networks to objectively discriminate\nbetween both flavors by utilizing a scalar-valued evolving climate network\nmeasure that quantifies spatial localization and dispersion in El Ni\\~no's\nassociated teleconnections. Our index displays a sharp peak (high localization)\nduring EP events, whereas during CP events (larger dispersion) it remains close\nto the baseline observed during normal periods. In contrast to previous\nclassification schemes, our approach specifically account for El Ni\\~no's\nglobal impacts. We confirm recent El Ni\\~no classifications for the years 1951\nto 2014 and assign types to those cases were former works yielded ambiguous\nresults. Ultimately, we study La Ni\\~na episodes and demonstrate that our index\nprovides a similar discrimination into two types.\n", "  The \"main road\" open by de Broglie's and Schroedinger's discovery of matter\nwaves and of their eigen-functions branched off, as is well known, into\ndifferent \"sub-routes\". The most widely accepted one is Standard Quantum\nMechanics (SQM), interpreting the time-dependent Schroedinger equation as the\nbasic evolution law of a wave-packet which represents the simultaneous\nprobabilistic permanence of a particle in its full set of eigenstates. Another\n\"sub-route\" is offered by Bohm's Mechanics, able to reproduce the same results\nof SQM, while interpreting the stream-lines of the probability current density\nas the \"quantum trajectories\" of the moving particles. Reminding that the\nso-called quasi-optical approximation represents a standard mathematical\ntechnique allowing a ray-based treatment of wave-like features, we present here\nan exact wave-mechanical \"sub-route\", based on the observation that the\ntime-independent Schroedinger equation may be treated, bypassing any\nquasi-optical approximation, in terms of a Hamiltonian set of rays mutually\ncoupled by an energy-dependent function (which we call \"Wave Potential\")\nencoded in the very structure of any Helmholtz-like equation. These rays lend\nthemselves to be interpreted as the exact wave-dynamical trajectories and\nmotion laws of classical-looking point-particles associated with the de\nBroglie-Schroedinger matter waves. The role of the Wave Potential, acting\nperpendicularly to the momentum of the moving particles, is to \"pilot\" them\nwithout any energy exchange: a property which isn't shared by the well-known\n\"Quantum Potential\" of the Bohmian theory, involving the entire spectrum of\npossible eigen-energies of a wave-packet. This property turns out to allow the\nnumerical computation of the particle trajectories, which we perform and\ndiscuss here for particles piloted by the Wave Potential in many different and\nsignificant force-fields.\n", "  Specific protein-protein interactions are crucial in the cell, both to ensure\nthe formation and stability of multi-protein complexes, and to enable signal\ntransduction in various pathways. Functional interactions between proteins\nresult in coevolution between the interaction partners, causing their sequences\nto be correlated. Here we exploit these correlations to accurately identify\nwhich proteins are specific interaction partners from sequence data alone. Our\ngeneral approach, which employs a pairwise maximum entropy model to infer\ncouplings between residues, has been successfully used to predict the\nthree-dimensional structures of proteins from sequences. Thus inspired, we\nintroduce an iterative algorithm to predict specific interaction partners from\ntwo protein families whose members are known to interact. We first assess the\nalgorithm's performance on histidine kinases and response regulators from\nbacterial two-component signaling systems. We obtain a striking 0.93 true\npositive fraction on our complete dataset without any a priori knowledge of\ninteraction partners, and we uncover the origin of this success. We then apply\nthe algorithm to proteins from ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter\ncomplexes, and obtain accurate predictions in these systems as well. Finally,\nwe present two metrics that accurately distinguish interacting protein families\nfrom non-interacting ones, using only sequence data.\n", "  We study the performance of all-mode-averaging (AMA) when used in conjunction\nwith a locally deflated SAP-preconditioned solver, determining how to optimize\nthe local block sizes and number of deflation fields in order to minimize the\ncomputational cost for a given level of overall statistical accuracy. We find\nthat AMA enables a reduction of the statistical error on nucleon charges by a\nfactor of around two at the same cost when compared to the standard method. As\na demonstration, we compute the axial, scalar and tensor charges of the nucleon\nin $N_f=2$ lattice QCD with non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson quarks,\nusing O(10,000) measurements to pursue the signal out to source-sink\nseparations of $t_s\\sim 1.5$ fm. Our results suggest that the axial charge is\nsuffering from a significant amount (5-10%) of excited-state contamination at\nsource-sink separations of up to $t_s\\sim 1.2$ fm, whereas the excited-state\ncontamination in the scalar and tensor charges seems to be small.\n", "  The computational study of conformational transitions in nucleic acids still\nfaces many challenges. For example, in the case of single stranded RNA\ntetranucleotides, agreement between simulations and experiments is not\nsatisfactory due to inaccuracies in the force fields commonly used in molecular\ndynamics simulations. We here use experimental data collected from\nhigh-resolution X-ray structures to attempt an improvement of the latest\nversion of the AMBER force field. A modified metadynamics algorithm is used to\ncalculate correcting potentials designed to enforce experimental distributions\nof backbone torsion angles. Replica-exchange simulations of tetranucleotides\nincluding these correcting potentials show significantly better agreement with\nindependent solution experiments for the oligonucleotides containing pyrimidine\nbases. Although the proposed corrections do not seem to be portable to generic\nRNA systems, the simulations revealed the importance of the alpha and beta\nbackbone angles on the modulation of the RNA conformational ensemble. The\ncorrection protocol presented here suggests a systematic procedure for\nforce-field refinement.\n", "  We give an introduction to, and review of, the energy-momentum tensors in\nclassical gauge field theories in Minkowski space, and to some extent also in\ncurved space-time. For the canonical energy-momentum tensor of non-Abelian\ngauge fields and of matter fields coupled to such fields, we present a new and\nsimple improvement procedure based on gauge invariance for constructing a gauge\ninvariant, symmetric energy-momentum tensor. The relationship with the\nEinstein-Hilbert tensor following from the coupling to a gravitational field is\nalso discussed.\n", "  We review some of our recent experimental studies on low-carrier\nconcentration, mesoscopic two-dimensional electron gases (m2DEGs). The m2DEGs\nshow a range of striking characteristics including a complete avoidance of the\nstrongly localised regime even when the electrical resistivity $\\rho >> h/e^2$,\ngiant thermoelectric response, and an apparent decoupling of charge and\nthermoelectric transport. We analyse the results and demonstrate that these\nobservations can be explained based on the assumption that the charge carriers\nretain phase coherence over the m2DEG dimensions. Intriguingly, this would\nimply phase coherence on lengthscales of up to 10 $\\mu$m and temperature $T$ up\nto 10 K which is significantly greater than conventionally expected in\nGaAs-based 2DEGs. Such unprecedentedly large phase coherence lengths open up\nseveral possibilities in quantum information and computation schemes.\n", "  We introduce the cut averaged entanglement entropy in disordered periodic\nspin chains and prove it to be a concave function of subsystem size for\nindividual eigenstates. This allows us to identify the entanglement scaling as\na function of subsystem size for individual states in inhomogeneous systems.\nUsing this quantity, we probe the critical region between the many-body\nlocalized (MBL) and ergodic phases in finite systems.\n  In the middle of the spectrum, we show evidence for bimodality of the\nentanglement distribution in the MBL critical region, finding both volume law\nand area law eigenstates over disorder realizations as well as within\n\\emph{single disorder realizations}. The disorder averaged entanglement entropy\nin this region then scales as a volume law with a coefficient below its thermal\nvalue. We discover in the critical region, as we approach the thermodynamic\nlimit, that the cut averaged entanglement entropy density falls on a\none-parameter family of curves. Finally, we also show that without averaging\nover cuts the slope of the entanglement entropy \\vs subsystem size can be\nnegative at intermediate and strong disorder, caused by rare localized regions\nin the system.\n", "  We employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the relaxation properties of the\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb glass in disordered semiconductors and the\nthree-dimensional Bose glass in type-II superconductors in the presence of\nextended linear defects. We investigate the effects of adding non-zero random\non-site energies from different distributions on the properties of the\ncorrelation-induced Coulomb gap in the density of states (DOS) and on the\nnon-equilibrium aging kinetics highlighted by the density autocorrelation\nfunctions. We also probe the sensitivity of the system's equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium relaxation properties to instantaneous changes in the density\nof charge carriers in the Coulomb glass or flux lines in the Bose glass.\n", "  We present new mid-IR observations of the quadruply lensed quasar Q2237+0305\ntaken with CanariCam on the Gran Telescopio Canarias. Mid-IR emission by hot\ndust, unlike the optical and near-IR emission from the accretion disk, is\nunaffected by the interstellar medium (extinction/scattering) or stellar\nmicrolensing. We compare these \"true\" ratios to the (stellar) microlensed flux\nratios observed in the optical/near-IR to constrain the structure of the quasar\naccretion disk. We find a half-light radius of\n$R_{1/2}=3.4_{-2.1}^{+5.3}\\sqrt{\\langle M \\rangle/0.3\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}}$\nlight-days at $\\lambda_{rest}=1736$ {\\AA}, and an exponent for the temperature\nprofile $R \\propto \\lambda^{p}$ of $p=0.79\\pm0.55$, where $p=4/3$ for a\nstandard thin-disk model. If we assume that the differences in the mid-IR flux\nratios measured over the years are due to microlensing variability, we find a\nlower limit for the size of the mid-IR-emitting region of $R_{1/2} \\gtrsim\n200\\,\\sqrt{\\langle M \\rangle/0.3\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}}$ light-days. We also test for\nthe presence of substructure/satellites by comparing the observed mid-IR flux\nratios with those predicted from smooth lens models. We can explain the\ndifferences if the surface density fraction in satellites near the lensed\nimages is $\\alpha = 0.033_{-0.019}^{+0.046}$ for a singular isothermal\nellipsoid plus external shear mass model or $\\alpha = 0.013_{-0.008}^{+0.019}$\nfor a mass model combining ellipsoidal NFW and de Vaucouleurs profiles in an\nexternal shear.\n", "  Light-matter interfaces enable the generation of entangled states of light\nand matter which can be exploited to steer the quantum state of matter through\nmeasurement of light and feedback. Here we consider continuous-time,\ninterferometric homodyne measurements of light on an array of light-matter\ninterfaces followed by local feedback acting on each material system\nindividually. While the systems are physically non-interacting, the feedback\nmaster equation we derive describes driven-dissipative, interacting many-body\nquantum dynamics, and comprises pairwise Hamiltonian interactions and\ncollective jump operators. We characterize the general class of\ndriven-dissipative many body systems which can be engineered in this way, and\nderive necessary conditions on models supporting non-trivial quantum dynamics\nbeyond what can be generated by local operations and classical communication.\nWe provide specific examples of models which allow for the creation of\nstationary many-particle entanglement, and the emulation of dissipative Ising\nmodels. Since the interaction between the systems is mediated via feedback\nonly, there is no intrinsic limit on the range or geometry of the interaction,\nmaking the scheme quite versatile.\n", "  We propose a simple method to quantify a possible exclusion of the inverted\nneutrino mass ordering from cosmological bounds on the sum of the neutrino\nmasses. The method is based on Bayesian inference and allows for a calculation\nof the posterior odds of normal versus inverted ordering. We apply the method\nfor a specific set of current data from Planck CMB data and large-scale\nstructure surveys, providing an upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses of\n0.14 eV at 95% CL. With this analysis we obtain posterior odds for normal\nversus inverted ordering of about 2:1. If cosmological data is combined with\ndata from oscillation experiments the odds reduce to about 3:2. For an\nexclusion of the inverted ordering from cosmology at more than 95% CL, an\naccuracy of better than 0.02 eV is needed for the sum. We demonstrate that such\na value could be reached with planned observations of large scale structure by\nanalysing artificial mock data for a EUCLID-like survey.\n", "  The response of nonlinear metamaterials and superconducting electronics to\ntwo-tone excitation is critical for understanding their use as low-noise\namplifiers and tunable filters. A new setting for such studies is that of\nmetamaterials made of radio frequency superconducting quantum interference\ndevices (rf-SQUIDs). The two-tone response of self-resonant rf-SQUID meta-atoms\nand metamaterials is studied here via intermodulation (IM) measurement over a\nbroad range of tone frequencies and tone powers. A sharp onset followed by a\nsurprising strongly suppressed IM region near the resonance is observed. Using\na two time scale analysis technique, we present an analytical theory that\nsuccessfully explains our experimental observations. The theory predicts that\nthe IM can be manipulated with tone power, center frequency, frequency\ndifference between the two tones, and temperature. This quantitative\nunderstanding potentially allows for the design of rf-SQUID metamaterials with\neither very low or very high IM response.\n", "  This brief report is an extension of a previus publication on $\\Psi(2S)$ to\n$J/\\Psi(1S)$ suppression in p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV to estimate $\\Psi(2S)$\nto $J/\\Psi(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$ to $\\Upsilon(1S)$ suppression via p-Pb\ncollisions at 8 TeV as proposed by the LHCb.\n", "  Photons with a twisted phase front carry a quantized amount of orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) and have become important in various fields of optics,\nsuch as quantum and classical information science or optical tweezers. Because\nno upper limit on the OAM content per photon is known, they are also\ninteresting systems to experimentally challenge quantum mechanical prediction\nfor high quantum numbers. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed\ntechnique to imprint unprecedented high values of OAM, namely spiral phase\nmirrors (SPM), to generate photons with more than 10,000 quanta of OAM.\nMoreover, we demonstrate quantum entanglement between these large OAM quanta of\none photon and the polarization of its partner photon. To our knowledge, this\ncorresponds to entanglement with the largest quantum number that has been\ndemonstrated in an experiment. The results may also open novel ways to couple\nsingle photons to massive objects, enhance angular resolution and highlight OAM\nas a promising way to increase the information capacity of a single photon.\n", "  The constitutive relations of a dense granular flow composed of\nself-propelling frictional hard particles are investigated by means of DEM\nnumerical simulations. We show that the rheology, which relates the dynamical\nfriction $\\mu$ and the volume fraction $\\phi$ to the inertial number $I$,\ndepends on a dimensionless number $\\mathcal{A}$, which compares the active\nforce to the confining pressure. Two liquid/solid transitions -- in the Maxwell\nrigidity sense -- are observed. As soon as the activity is turned on, the\npacking becomes an `active solid' with a mean number of particle contacts\nlarger than the isostatic value. The quasi-static values of $\\mu$ and $\\phi$\ndecrease with $\\mathcal{A}$. At a finite value of the activity $\\mathcal{A}_t$,\ncorresponding to the isostatic condition, a second `active rigidity transition'\nis observed beyond which the quasi-static values of the friction vanishes and\nthe rheology becomes Newtonian. For $\\mathcal{A}>\\mathcal{A}_t$, we provide\nevidence for a highly intermittent dynamics of this 'active fluid'.\n", "  The interaction of a quantum system, which is not accessible by direct\nmeasurement, with an external probe can be exploited to infer specific features\nof the system itself. We introduce a probing scheme based on the emergence of\nspontaneous quantum synchronization between an out-of-equilibrium qubit, in\ncontact with an external environment, and a probe qubit. Tuning the frequency\nof the probe leads to a transition between synchronization in phase and\nantiphase. The sharp transition between these two regimes is locally accessible\nby monitoring the probe dynamics alone and allows one to reconstruct the shape\nof the spectral density of the environment.\n", "  The Python--elsA user interface of the elsA cfd (Computational Fluid\nDynamics) software has been developed to allow users to specify simulations\nwith confidence, through a global context of description objects grouped inside\nscripts. The software main features are generated documentation, context\nchecking and completion, and helpful error management. Further developments\nhave used this foundation as a coupling framework, allowing (thanks to the\ndescriptive approach) the coupling of external algorithms with the cfd solver\nin a simple and abstract way, leading to more success in complex simulations.\nAlong with the description of the technical part of the interface, we try to\ngather the salient points pertaining to the psychological viewpoint of user\nexperience (ux). We point out the differences between user interfaces and pure\ndata management systems such as cgns.\n", "  WD 1145+017 was observed from 2015 November to 2016 July for the purpose of\ncharacterizing transit behavior of the white dwarf by dust clouds thought to be\nproduced by fragments of an asteroid in close orbit with the star.\nFortuitously, most of these observations were carried out during a time when\nthe overall `dip' activity was dramatically enhanced over that during its\ndiscovery with Kepler K2. By the end of our reported observations the dip\nactivity had declined to a level close to its K2 discovery state. Three notable\nevents were observed. In 2016 January a large number of dust clouds appeared\nthat had an orbital period of 4.4912 hours, and this event also marked the end\nof a 3-month interval dominated by the K2 `A' period. The second event was a\n2016 April 21 appearance of four dip features with drift lines in a waterfall\ndiagram (date vs. phase) that diverged from their origin date, at a location\naway from the `A' asteroid, and which lasted for two weeks. The third event was\nthe sudden appearance of a dip feature with a period of 4.6064 hours, which is\nessentially the same as the K2 `B' period. The evolution of dip shape, depth,\nand total fade amount provide constraints on dust production and loss\nmechanisms. Collisions can account for the sudden appearance of dust clouds,\nand the sudden increase in dust amount, but another mechanism for continual\ndust production is also required.\n", "  We present an approach to study the interaction between matter and evanescent\nfields. The approach is based on the decomposition of evanescent plane waves\ninto multipoles of well-defined angular momentum transverse to both decay and\npropagation directions. We use the approach to identify the origin of the\nrecently observed directional coupling of emitters into guided modes, and of\nthe opposite Zeeman state excitation of atoms near a fiber. We explain how to\nrigorously quantify both effects, and show that the directionality and the\ndifference in excitation rates grow exponentially with the multipolar order of\nthe light-matter interaction. We also use the approach to study and maximize\nthe transverse torque exerted by an evanescent plane wave onto a given\nspherical absorbing particle. The maximum occurs at the quadrupolar order of\nthe particle, and for a particular polarization of the plane wave. All the\nobtained physical insights can be traced back to the two main features of the\ndecomposition of evanescent plane waves into transverse multipolar modes: A\npolarization independent exponential dominance of modes with large transverse\nangular momentum, and a polarization controlled parity selection rule.\n", "  Dark matter associated visible particle production at high energy colliders\nprovides a unique way to determine the microscopic properties of the dark\nmatter. We investigate a pair of fermionic dark matter particles associated\nwith a b-jet production at the LHC, through a mediator which couples to\nstandard model or dark matter particles via either a vector or axial-vector\ncoupling. The calculation is performed by implementing these simplified models\nin the FeynRules/MadGraph5 aMC@NLO framework. In our calculation,\nnext-to-leading order QCD corrections and parton-shower effects are considered.\nWe find that this process has a sizeable cross section and the QCD correction\ncan reach more than 2 times than LO results. We also investigate the discovery\npotential in several benchmark scenarios at the 13TeV LHC.\n", "  Heavy even-even nuclei exhibit low-energy collective excitations that are\nseparated in scale from the microscopic (fermion) degrees of freedom. This\nseparation of scale allows us to approach nuclear vibrations within an\neffective field theory (EFT). In odd-mass nuclei collective and single-particle\nproperties compete at low energies, and this makes their description more\nchallenging. In this article we describe odd-mass nuclei with ground-state spin\n$I=\\sfrac{1}{2}$ by means of an EFT that couples a fermion to the collective\ndegrees of freedom of an even-even core. The EFT relates observables such as\nenergy levels, electric quadrupole ($E2$) transition strengths, and magnetic\ndipole ($M1$) moments of the odd-mass nucleus to those of its even-even\nneighbor, and allows us to quantify theoretical uncertainties. For isotopes of\nrhodium and silver the theoretical description is consistent with data within\nexperimental and theoretical uncertainties. Several testable predictions are\nmade.\n", "  Application of a negative field on a positively poled ferroelectric sample\ncan enhance the electrocaloric cooling and appears as a promising method to\noptimize the electrocaloric cycle. Experimental measurements show that the\nmaximal cooling does not appear at the zero-polarization point, but around the\nshoulder of the P-E loop. This phenomenon cannot be explained by the theory\nbased on the constant total entropy assumption under adiabatic condition. In\nfact, adiabatic condition does not imply constant total entropy when\nirreversibility is involved. A direct entropy analysis approach based on work\nloss is proposed in this work, which takes the entropy contribution of the\nirreversible process into account. The optimal reversed field determined by\nthis approach agrees with the experimental observations. This study signifies\nthe importance of considering the irreversible process in the electrocaloric\ncycles.\n", "  In characterization of quantum systems, adapting measurement settings based\non data while it is collected can generally outperform in efficiency\nconventional measurements that are carried out independently of data. The\nexisting methods for choosing measurement settings adaptively assume that the\nmodel, or the number of unknown parameters, is known. We introduce simultaneous\nadaptive model selection and parameter estimation. We apply our technique for\ncharacterization of a superconducting qubit and a bath of incoherent two-level\nsystems, a leading decoherence mechanism in the state-of-the-art\nsuperconducting qubits.\n", "  The topological structure of the wavefunctions of particles in periodic\npotentials is characterized by the Berry curvature $\\Omega_{kn}$ whose integral\non the Brillouin zone is a topological invariant known as the Chern number. The\nbulk-boundary correspondence states that these numbers define the number of\nedge or surface topologically protected states. It is then of primary interest\nto find experimental techniques able to measure the Berry curvature. However,\nup to now, there are no spectroscopic experiments that proved to be capable to\nobtain information on $\\Omega_{kn}$ to distinguish different topological\nstructures of the $\\it{bulk}$ wavefunctions of semiconducting materials. Based\non experimental results of the dipolar matrix elements for graphene, here we\nshow that ARPES experiments with the appropriate x-ray energies and\npolarization can unambiguously detect changes of the Chern numbers in\ndynamically driven graphene and graphene-like materials opening new routes\ntowards the experimental study of topological properties of condensed matter\nsystems.\n", "  A treatment is given of the nonperturbative QCD vacuum in a magnetic field.\nThe low-energy equation for the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in a\nmagnetic field is derived. It is shown that the derivatives with respect to a\nmagnetic field of the quark and gluon contributions to the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor are equal. The dependence of the gluon condensate on the\nmagnetic field strength is derived both for strong and weak fields.\n", "  Suspended graphene is difficult to image by scanning probe microscopy due to\nthe inherent van-der-Waals and dielectric forces exerted by the tip which are\nnot counteracted by a substrate. Here, we report scanning tunneling microscopy\ndata of suspended monolayer graphene in constant-current mode revealing a\nsurprising honeycomb structure with amplitude of 50$-$200 pm and lattice\nconstant of 10-40 nm. The apparent lattice constant is reduced by increasing\nthe tunneling current $I$, but does not depend systematically on tunneling\nvoltage $V$ or scan speed $v_{\\rm scan}$. The honeycomb lattice of the rippling\nis aligned with the atomic structure observed on supported areas, while no\natomic corrugation is found on suspended areas down to the resolution of about\n$3-4$ pm. We rule out that the honeycomb structure is induced by the feedback\nloop using a changing $v_{\\rm scan}$, that it is a simple enlargement effect of\nthe atomic resolution as well as models predicting frozen phonons or standing\nphonon waves induced by the tunneling current. Albeit we currently do not have\na convincing explanation for the observed effect, we expect that our intriguing\nresults will inspire further research related to suspended graphene.\n", "  Until now, systematic errors in strong gravitational lens modeling have been\nacknowledged but never been fully quantified. Here, we launch an investigation\ninto the systematics induced by constraint selection. We model the simulated\ncluster Ares 362 times using random selections of image systems with and\nwithout spectroscopic redshifts and quantify the systematics using several\ndiagnostics: image predictability, accuracy of model-predicted redshifts,\nenclosed mass, and magnification. We find that for models with $>15$ image\nsystems, the image plane rms does not decrease significantly when more systems\nare added; however the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as\nto the ability of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well\nconstrained near the Einstein radius in all cases, and systematic error drops\nto $<2\\%$ for models using $>10$ image systems. Magnification errors are\nsmallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of\nthe magnification is systematically lower near curved portions. For $>15$\nsystems, the systematic error on magnification is $\\sim2\\%$. We report no trend\nin magnification error with fraction of spectroscopic image systems when\nselecting constraints at random; however, when using the same selection of\nconstraints, increasing this fraction up to $\\sim0.5$ will increase model\naccuracy. The results suggest that the selection of constraints, rather than\nquantity alone, determines the accuracy of the magnification. We note that\nspectroscopic follow-up of at least a few image systems is crucial, as models\nwithout any spectroscopic redshifts are inaccurate across all of our\ndiagnostics.\n", "  For decades, scientists have tried to explain the evidence for fluvial\nactivity on early Mars, but a consensus has yet to emerge regarding the\nmechanism for producing it. One hypothesis suggests early Mars was warmed by a\nthick greenhouse atmosphere. Another suggests that early Mars was generally\ncold but was warmed occasionally by impacts or by episodes of enhanced\nvolcanism. These latter hypotheses struggle to produce the amounts of rainfall\nneeded to form the martian valleys, but are consistent with inferred low rates\nof weathering compared to Earth. Here, we provide a geophysical mechanism that\ncould have induced cycles of glaciation and deglaciation on early Mars. Our\nmodel produces dramatic climate cycles with extended periods of glaciation\npunctuated by warm periods lasting up to 10 Myr, much longer than those\ngenerated in other episodic warming models. The cycles occur because stellar\ninsolation was low, and because CO2 outgassing is not able to keep pace with\nCO2 consumption by silicate weathering followed by deposition of carbonates.\nWhile CO2 by itself is not able to deglaciate early Mars in our model, we\nassume that the greenhouse effect is enhanced by substantial amounts of H2\noutgassed from Mars' reduced crust and mantle. Our hypothesis can be tested by\nfuture Mars exploration that better establishes the time scale for valley\nformation.\n", "  Free energies play a central role in many descriptions of equilibrium and\nnon-equilibrium properties of solids. Continuum partial differential equations\n(PDEs) of atomic transport, phase transformations and mechanics often rely on\nfirst and second derivatives of a free energy function. The stability, accuracy\nand robustness of numerical methods to solve these PDEs are sensitive to the\nparticular functional representations of the free energy. In this communication\nwe investigate the influence of different representations of thermodynamic data\non phase field computations of diffusion and two-phase reactions in the solid\nstate. First-principles statistical mechanics methods were used to generate\nrealistic free energy data for HCP titanium with interstitially dissolved\noxygen. While Redlich-Kister polynomials have formed the mainstay of\nthermodynamic descriptions of multi-component solids, they require high order\nterms to fit oscillations in chemical potentials around phase transitions. Here\nwe demonstrate that high fidelity fits to rapidly fluctuating free energy\nfunctions are obtained with spline functions. Spline functions that are many\ndegrees lower than Redlich-Kister polynomials provide equal or superior fits to\nchemical potential data and, when used in phase field computations, result in\nsolution times approaching an order of magnitude speed up relative to the use\nof Redlich-Kister polynomials.\n", "  We simulate the decay dynamics of an isolated monopole defect in the nematic\nvector of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate during the polar-to-ferromagnetic\nphase transition of the system. Importantly, the decay of the monopole occurs\nin the absence of external magnetic fields and is driven principally by the\ndynamical instability due to the ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions. An\ninitial isolated monopole is observed to relax into a polar-core spin vortex,\nthus demonstrating the spontaneous transformation of a point defect of the\npolar order parameter manifold to a line defect of the ferromagnetic manifold.\nWe also investigate the dynamics of an isolated monopole pierced by a quantum\nvortex line with winding number k. It is shown to decay into a coreless\nAnderson-Toulouse vortex if k = 1 and into a singular vortex with an empty core\nif k = 2. In both cases, the resulting vortex is also encircled by a polar-core\nvortex ring.\n", "  Bragg diffraction has been used in atom interferometers because it allows\nsignal enhancement through multiphoton momentum transfer and suppression of\nsystematics by not changing the internal state of atoms. Its multi-port nature,\nhowever, can lead to parasitic interferometers, allows for intensity-dependent\nphase shifts in the primary interferometers, and distorts the ellipses used for\nphase extraction. We study and suppress these unwanted effects. Specifically,\nphase extraction by ellipse fitting and the resulting systematic phase shifts\nare calculated by Monte Carlo simulations. Phase shifts arising from the\nthermal motion of the atoms are controlled by spatial selection of atoms and an\nappropriate choice of Bragg intensity. In these simulations, we found that\nGaussian Bragg pulse shapes yield the smallest systematic shifts. Parasitic\ninterferometers are suppressed by a \"magic\" Bragg pulse duration. The\nsensitivity of the apparatus was improved by the addition of AC Stark shift\ncompensation, which permits direct experimental study of sub-part-per-billion\n(ppb) systematics. This upgrade allows for a 310\\,$\\hbar k$ momentum transfer,\ngiving an unprecedented 6.6\\,Mrad measured in a Ramsey-Bord\\'e interferometer.\n", "  Electric deflection measurements on liquid helium nanodroplets doped with\nindividual polar molecules demonstrate that the cold superfluid matrix enables\nfull orientation of the molecular dipole along the external field. This\ntranslates into a deflection force which is increased enormously by comparison\nwith typical deflection experiments, and it becomes possible to measurably\ndeflect neutral doped droplets with masses of tens to hundreds of thousands of\nDaltons. This approach permits preparation and study of continuous fluxes of\nfully oriented polar molecules and is broadly and generally applicable,\nincluding to complex and biological molecules. It is shown that the dipole\nmoments of internally cryogenically cold molecules can be directly determined\nfrom a deflection measurement on the doped nanodroplet beam.\n", "  We report the folding thermodynamics of ccUUCGgg and ccGAGAgg RNA tetraloops\nusing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We obtain a previously\nunreported estimation of the folding free energy using parallel tempering in\ncombination with well-tempered metadynamics. A key ingredient is the use of a\nrecently developed metric distance, eRMSD, as a biased collective variable. We\nfind that the native fold of both tetraloops is not the global free energy\nminimum using the Amber\\c{hi}OL3 force field. The estimated folding free\nenergies are 30.2kJ/mol for UUCG and 7.5 kJ/mol for GAGA, in striking\ndisagreement with experimental data. We evaluate the viability of all possible\none-dimensional backbone force field corrections. We find that disfavoring the\ngauche+ region of {\\alpha} and {\\zeta} angles consistently improves the\nexisting force field. The level of accuracy achieved with these corrections,\nhowever, cannot be considered sufficient by judging on the basis of available\nthermodynamic data and solution experiments.\n", "  Proton decay is one of the most important predictions of the grand unified\ntheory (GUT). In the supersymmetric (SUSY) GUT, proton decays via the\ndimension-five operators need to be suppressed. In the $SO(10)$ model where\n${\\bf 10}+\\overline{\\bf 126}$ Higgs fields couple to fermions, neutrino\noscillation parameters including the CP-violating\nPontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) phase can be related to the Yukawa\ncouplings to generate the dimension-five operators in the unified framework. We\nshow how the suppressed proton decay depends on the PMNS phase, and stress the\nimportance of the precise measurements of the PMNS phase as well as the\nneutrino 23-mixing angle. These become especially important if the SUSY\nparticles are found around less than a few TeV at LHC and proton decays are\nobserved at Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments in the near future.\n", "  Combining multiple emergent correlated properties such as superconductivity\nand magnetism within the topological matrix can have exceptional consequences\nin garnering new and exotic physics. Here, we study the topological surface\nstates from a noncentrosymmetric $\\alpha$-BiPd superconductor by employing\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first principle\ncalculations. We observe that the Dirac surface states of this system have\nseveral interesting and unusual properties, compared to other topological\nsurface states. The surface state is strongly anisotropic and the in-plane\nFermi velocity varies rigorously on rotating the crystal about the $y$-axis.\nMoreover, it acquires an unusual band gap as a function of $k_y$, possibly due\nto hybridization with bulk bands, detected upon varying the excitation energy.\nCoexistence of all the functional properties, in addition to the unusual\nsurface state characteristics make this an interesting material.\n", "  Random electron systems show rich phases such as Anderson insulator,\ndiffusive metal, quantum and anomalous quantum Hall insulator, Weyl semimetal,\nas well as strong/weak topological insulators. Eigenfunctions of each matter\nphase have specific features, but due to the random nature of systems, judging\nthe matter phase from eigenfunctions is difficult. Here we propose the deep\nlearning algorithm to capture the features of eigenfunctions.\nLocalization-delocalization transition as well as disordered Chern\ninsulator-Anderson insulator transition is discussed.\n", "  Annihilation of Dark Matter (DM) particles has been recognized as one of the\npossible mechanisms for the production of non-thermal particles and radiation\nin galaxy clusters. Previous studies have shown that, while DM models can\nreproduce the spectral properties of the radio halo in the Coma cluster, they\nfail in reproducing the shape of the radio halo surface brightness because they\nproduce a shape that is too concentrated towards the center of the cluster with\nrespect to the observed one. However, in previous studies the DM distribution\nwas modeled as a single spherically symmetric halo, while the DM distribution\nin Coma is found to have a complex and elongated shape. In this work we\ncalculate a range of non-thermal emissions in the Coma cluster by using the\nobserved distribution of DM sub-halos. We find that, by including the observed\nsub-halos in the DM model, we obtain a radio surface brightness with a shape\nsimilar to the observed one, and that the sub-halos boost the radio emission by\na factor between 5 and 20%, thus allowing to reduce the gap between the\nannihilation cross section required to reproduce the radio halo flux and the\nupper limits derived from other observations, and that this gap can be\nexplained by realistic values of the boosting factor due to smaller\nsubstructures. Models with neutralino mass of 9 GeV and composition $\\tau^+\n\\tau^-$, and mass of 43 GeV and composition $b \\bar b$ can fit the radio halo\nspectrum using the observed properties of the magnetic field in Coma, and do\nnot predict a gamma-ray emission in excess compared to the recent Fermi-LAT\nupper limits. These findings make these DM models viable candidate to explain\nthe origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters. [abridged]\n", "  The Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff method of finding the nonperturbative solutions\nin field theory is based on the Fock decomposition of the state vector,\ncomplemented with the sector-dependent nonperturbative renormalization scheme.\nWe show in detail how to implement the renormalization procedure and to solve\nthe simplest nontrivial example of the scalar Yukawa model in the two- and\nthree-body Fock space truncations incorporating scalar \"nucleon\" and one or two\nscalar \"pions\".\n", "  Connecting the collective behavior of disordered systems with local structure\non the particle scale is an important challenge, for example in granular and\nglassy systems. Compounding complexity, in many scientific and industrial\napplications, particles are polydisperse, aspherical or even of varying shape.\nHere, we investigate a generalization of the classical kissing problem in order\nto understand the local building blocks of packings of aspherical grains. We\nnumerically determine the densest local structures of uniaxial ellipsoids by\nminimizing the Set Voronoi cell volume around a given particle. Depending on\nthe particle aspect ratio, different local structures are observed and\nclassified by symmetry and Voronoi coordination number. In extended disordered\npackings of frictionless particles, knowledge of the densest structures allows\nto rescale the Voronoi volume distributions onto the single-parameter family of\n$k$-Gamma distributions. Moreover, we find that approximate icosahedral\nclusters are found in random packings, while the optimal local structures for\nmore aspherical particles are not formed.\n", "  Effectively continuous control over propagation of a beam of light requires\nlight modulation with pixelation that is smaller than the optical wavelength.\nHere we propose a spatial intensity modulator with sub-wavelength resolution in\none dimension. The metadevice combines recent advances in reconfigurable\nnanomembrane metamaterials and coherent all-optical control of metasurfaces. It\nuses nanomechanical actuation of metasurface absorber strips placed near a\nmirror in order to control their interaction with light from perfect absorption\nto negligible loss, promising a path towards dynamic beam diffraction, light\nfocusing and holography without unwanted diffraction artefacts.\n", "  We construct a general class of Calabi--Yau threefolds from fiber products of\nrational elliptic surfaces with section, generalizing a construction of Schoen\nto include all Kodaira fiber types. The resulting threefolds each have two\nelliptic fibrations with section over rational elliptic surfaces and blowups\nthereof. These elliptic fibrations generally have nonzero Mordell--Weil rank.\nEach of the elliptic fibrations has a physical interpretation in terms of a\nsix-dimensional F-theory model with one or more non-Higgsable abelian gauge\nfields. Many of the models in this class have mild singularities that do not\nadmit a Calabi--Yau resolution; this does not seem to compromise the physical\nintegrity of the theory and can be associated in some cases with massless\nhypermultiplets localized at the singular loci. In some of these constructions,\nhowever, we find examples of abelian gauge fields that cannot be \"unHiggsed\" to\na nonabelian gauge field without producing unphysical singularities that cannot\nbe resolved. The models studied here can also be used to exhibit T-duality for\na class of little string theories.\n", "  An interferometer has been used to measure the surface profile of generic\nobject. Frequency scanning interferometry has been employed to provide\nunambiguous phase readings, to suppress etalon fringes, and to supersede\nphase-shifting. The frequency scan has been performed in three narrow\nwavelength bands, each generated by a temperature tuned laser diode. It is\nshown, that for certain portions of measured object, it was possible to get\nabsolute phase measurement, counting all wave periods from the point of zero\npath difference, yielding precision of 2.7nm RMS over 11.75mm total path\ndifference. For the other areas where steep slopes were present in object\ngeometry, a relative measurement is still possible, at measured surface\nroughness comparable to that of machining process (the same 2.7nm RMS). It is\nconcluded, that areas containing steep slopes exhibit systematic error,\nattributed to a combined factors of dispersion and retrace error.\n", "  The bulk of observed ultrahigh energy cosmic rays could be light or heavier\nelements, and originate from an either steady or transient population of\nsources. This leaves us with four general categories of sources. Energetic\nrequirements set a lower limit on single source luminosities, while the\ndistribution of particle arrival directions in the sky sets a lower limit on\nthe source number density. The latter constraint depends on the angular\nsmearing in the skymap due to the magnetic deflections of the charged particles\nduring their propagation from the source to the Earth. We contrast these limits\nwith the luminosity functions from surveys of existing luminous steady objects\nin the nearby universe, and strongly constrain one of the four categories of\nsource models, namely, steady proton sources. The possibility that cosmic rays\nwith energy $> 8\\times 10^{19}\\,$eV are dominantly pure protons coming from\nsteady sources is excluded at 95\\% confidence level, under the safe assumption\nthat protons experience less than $30^\\circ$ magnetic deflection on flight.\n", "  The observed extragalactic background light (EBL) is affected by light\nattenuation due to absorption of light by galactic and intergalactic dust in\nthe Universe. Even galactic opacity of 10-20 percent and minute universe\nintergalactic opacity of $0.01\\,\\mathrm{mag}\\,h\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^{-1}$ at the\nlocal Universe have a significant impact on the EBL because obscuration of\ngalaxies and density of intergalactic dust increase with redshift as\n$\\left(1+z\\right)^3$. Consequently, intergalactic opacity increases and the\nUniverse becomes considerably opaque at $z > 3$. Adopting realistic values for\ngalactic and intergalactic opacity, the estimates of the EBL for the expanding\ndusty universe are close to observations. The luminosity density evolution fits\nwell measurements. The model reproduces a steep increase of the luminosity\ndensity at $z<2$, its maximum at $z=2-3$, and its decrease at higher redshifts.\nThe increase of the luminosity density at low $z$ is not produced by the\nevolution of the star formation rate but by the fact that the Universe occupied\na smaller volume in previous epochs. The decline of the luminosity density at\nhigh $z$ originates in the opacity of the Universe. The calculated bolometric\nEBL ranges from 100 to 200 $\\mathrm{n W m}^{-2}\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ and is within\nthe limits of 40 and 200 $\\mathrm{n W m}^{-2}\\mathrm{sr}^{-1}$ of current EBL\nobservations. The model predicts 98\\% of the EBL coming from radiation of\ngalaxies at $z<3.5$. Accounting for light extinction by intergalactic dust\nimplies that the Universe was probably more opaque than dark for $z>3.5$.\n", "  Magnetic B-type stars exhibit photometric variability due to diverse causes,\nand consequently on a variety of timescales. In this paper we describe\ninterpretation of BRITE photometry and related ground-based observations of 4\nmagnetic B-type systems: $\\epsilon$ Lupi, $\\tau$ Sco, a Cen and $\\epsilon$ CMa.\n", "  A ThO$_{2}$ sample and a nickel activation foil were irradiated in the\nleakage neutron field of CFBR-II reactor. The activities of the activation\nproducts were measured after irradiation to obtain the reaction rates. The\nnormalized reaction rates were also calculated based on the ENDF/B-VII.1,\nCENDL-3.1, JENDL-4.0, BROND-2.2 databases. The experimental reaction rate ratio\nis 4.37 with an uncertainty of 3.9\\% which is coincident with each of the\nratios calculated based on the ENDFB-VII. 1, JENDL-4.0, BROND-2.2 databases,\nbut is 11.2\\% larger than that based on CENDL-3.1 database.\n", "  Formation of self-trapped holes (STH) in a comprehensive list of scintillator\nmaterials, including halides and chalcogenides, are studied using an accurate\nand computationally efficient first-principles method, the polaron\nself-interaction correction (pSIC). The key characteristics of small hole\npolarons, including their geometries, energies and degree of localization, are\nfound vastly different from halides to oxides to systems with open-shell\ncations. Nevertheless, we find a universal linear relation between the energy\ngap separating the bound hole level from the valence band maximum and the\nelastic energy associated with the lattice displacement field that accompanies\nthe polaron.\n", "  In both high-performance computing (HPC) environments and the public cloud,\nthe duration of time to retrieve or save your results is simultaneously\nunpredictable and important to your over all resource budget. It is generally\naccepted (\"Google: Taming the Long Latency Tail - When More Machines Equals\nWorse Results\", Todd Hoff, highscalability.com 2012), but without a robust\nexplanation, that identical parallel tasks do take different durations to\ncomplete -- a phenomena known as variability. This paper advances understanding\nof this topic. We carefully choose a model from which system-level complexity\nemerges that can be studied directly. We find that a generalized extreme value\n(GEV) model for variability naturally emerges. Using the public cloud, we find\nreal-world observations have excellent agreement with our model. Since the GEV\ndistribution is a limit distribution this suggests a universal property of\nparallel systems gated by the slowest communication element of some sort.\nHence, this model is applicable to a variety of processing and IO tasks in\nparallel environments. These findings have important implications, ranging from\ncharacterizing ideal performance for parallel codes to detecting degraded\nbehaviour at extreme scales.\n", "  We report total-energy calculations based on the density-functional theory\nthat clarify microscopic mechanisms of initial stage of graphene formation on\nthe SiC(0001) surface. We explore favorable reactions for desorption of either\nSi or C atoms from the stepped surface by determining the desorption and the\nsubsequent migration pathways and calculating the corresponding energy barriers\nfor the first time. We find that the energy barrier for the desorption of an Si\natom at the step edge and the subsequent migration toward stable terrace sites\nare lower than that of a C atom by 0.75 eV, indicative of the selective\ndesorption of Si from the SiC surface. We also find that the subsequent Si\ndesorption is an exothermic reaction. This exothermicity comes from the energy\ngain due to the bond formation of C atoms being left near the step edges. This\nis certainly a seed of graphene flakes.\n", "  A possibility of the condensation of excitations with a non-zero momentum in\nrectilinearly moving and rotating superfluid bosonic and fermionic (with Cooper\npairing) media is considered in terms of a phenomenological order-parameter\nfunctional at zero and non-zero temperature. The results might be applicable to\nthe description of bosonic systems like superfluid $^4$He, ultracold atomic\nBose gases, charged pion and kaon condensates in rotating neutron stars, and\nvarious superconducting fermionic systems with pairing, like proton and\ncolor-superconducting components in compact stars, metallic superconductors,\nand neutral fermionic systems with pairing, like the neutron component in\ncompact stars and ultracold atomic Fermi gases. Order parameters of the\n\"mother\" condensate in the superfluid and the new condensate of excitations,\ncorresponding energy gains, critical temperatures and critical velocities are\nfound.\n", "  Current technologies for X-ray detection rely on scintillation from expensive\ninorganic crystals grown at high-temperature, which so far has hindered the\ndevelopment of large-area scintillator arrays. Thanks to the presence of heavy\natoms, solution-grown hybrid lead halide perovskite single crystals exhibit\nshort X-ray absorption length and excellent detection efficiency. Here we\ncompare X-ray scintillator characteristics of three-dimensional (3D) MAPbI3 and\nMAPbBr3 and two-dimensional (2D) (EDBE)PbCl4 hybrid perovskite crystals. X-ray\nexcited thermoluminescence measurements indicate the absence of deep traps and\na very small density of shallow trap states, which lessens after-glow effects.\nAll perovskite single crystals exhibit high X-ray excited luminescence yields\nof >120,000 photons/MeV at low temperature. Although thermal quenching is\nsignificant at room temperature, the large exciton binding energy of 2D\n(EDBE)PbCl4 significantly reduces thermal effects compared to 3D perovskites,\nand moderate light yield of 9,000 photons/MeV can be achieved even at room\ntemperature. This highlights the potential of 2D metal halide perovskites for\nlarge-area and low-cost scintillator devices for medical, security and\nscientific applications.\n", "  The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) is an experiment that utilizes the\nconcept of resonant enhancement to improve on the sensitivity of traditional\nlight shining through a wall style experiments. These experiments attempt to\ndetect photons passing through an opaque wall by converting to relativistic\nweakly interacting sub-eV particles and then reconverting back to photons. ALPS\nII at DESY in Hamburg, Germany will use dually resonant optical cavities before\nand after the wall to increase the probability of this interaction occurring.\nThis paper gives a technical overview and status report of the experiment.\n", "  The velocity of neutrons from a pulsed neutron source is well-defined as a\nfunction of their arrival time. Electromagnetic neutron accelerator/decelerator\nsynchronized with the neutron time-of-flight is capable of selectively changing\nthe neutron velocity and concentrating the velocity distribution. Possible\nenhancement of the neutron intensity at a specific neutron velocity by orders\nof magnitude is discussed together with an experimental design.\n", "  We obtained two astronomical values, the Earth-Venus distance and Venus\ndiameter, by means of a geometrical treatment of photos taken of Venus transit\nin June of 2012. Here we presented the static and translational modelsthat were\nelaborated taking into account the Earth and Venus orbital movements. An\nadditional correction was also added by considering the Earth rotation\nmovement. The results obtained were compared with the values of reference from\nliterature, showing very good concordance.\n", "  We propose a system of real-space envelope function equations without fitting\nparameters for modeling the electronic spectrum and wave functions of a\nphosphorus donor atom embedded in silicon. The approach relies on the\nBurt-Foreman envelope function representation and leads to coupled\neffective-mass Schroedinger equations containing smooth effective potentials.\nThese potentials result from the spatial filtering imposed on the exact\npotential energy matrix elements in the envelope function representation. The\ncorresponding filter function is determined from the definition of the envelope\nfunction. The resulting effective potentials and the system of envelope\nfunctions jointly reproduce the valley-orbit coupling effect in the doped\nsilicon. Including the valley-orbit coupling not only of the 1s, but also for\n2s atomic orbitals, as well as static dielectric screening is found crucial to\naccurately reproduce experimental data. The measured binding energies are\nrecovered with a maximum relative error of 1.53 %. The computed wave functions\nare in a good agreement with experimental measurements of the electron density\nprovided by scanning tunneling microscopy.\n", "  The Arizona-NOAO Temporal Analysis and Response to Events System (ANTARES) is\na joint effort of NOAO and the Department of Computer Science at the University\nof Arizona to build prototype software to process alerts from time-domain\nsurveys, especially LSST, to identify those alerts that must be followed up\nimmediately. Value is added by annotating incoming alerts with existing\ninformation from previous surveys and compilations across the electromagnetic\nspectrum and from the history of past alerts. Comparison against a knowledge\nrepository of properties and features of known or predicted kinds of variable\nphenomena is used for categorization. The architecture and algorithms being\nemployed are described.\n", "  The inverse problem of recovering a smooth simply connected multisheet planar\ndomain from its Steklov spectrum is equivalent to the problem of determination,\nup to a gauge transform, of a smooth positive function $a$ on the unit circle\nfrom the spectrum of the operator $a\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ is the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator of the unit disk. Zeta-invariants are defined by\n$Z_m(a)={\\rm Tr}[(a\\Lambda)^{2m}-(aD)^{2m}]$ for every smooth function $a$. In\nthe case of a positive $a$, zeta-invariants are determined by the Steklov\nspectrum. We obtain some estimate from below for $Z_m(a)$ in the case of a real\nfunction $a$. On using the estimate, we prove the compactness of a Steklov\nisospectral family of planar domains in the $C^\\infty$-topology. We also\ndescribe all real functions $a$ satisfying $Z_m(a)=0$.\n", "  The effects of temperature and humidity on the estimation of air pollution by\nbenzene by using the piezoelectric crystal gas sensor were studied.\nPolyvinylchloride films were used as substrate for the immobilization of\npolymethylphenylsiloxane onto the electrode surface of the piezoelectric\ncrystal. The sensing layer consisting of polymethylphenylsiloxane and\npolyvinylchloride was used for real-time monitoring of benzene, one of the\natmospheric pollutants. According to the humidity from 35% to 75%, the upper\nlimit of detection by this sensor was decreased and the response time and\nfrequency recovery time for detecting benzene were long. On the other hand, as\nincreasing the temperature, the response time and the frequency recovery time\nof the sensor were short, but its sensitivity got worse. The models for the\ncorrelation between the benzene concentration and temperature (or humidity)\nwere presented.\n", "  In this paper, first we introduce a quantity called a partition function for\na quiver mutation sequence. The partition function is a generating function\nwhose weight is a $q$-binomial associated with each mutation. Then, we show\nthat the partition function can be expressed as a ratio of products of quantum\ndilogarithms. This provides a systematic way of constructing various\n$q$-binomial multisum identities.\n", "  A combination of analytical calculations and vectormagnetogram data are\nutilized to develop a non-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field and asses\nits viability in describing solar active regions. For the purpose, we construct\na local spherical shell where a planar surface, tangential to the inner sphere,\nrepresents a Cartesian cutout of an active region. The magnetic field defined\non the surface is then correlated with magnetograms. The analysis finds the\nnon-axisymmetric non-force-free magnetic field, obtained by a superposition of\ntwo linear-force-free fields, correlates reasonably well with magnetograms.\n", "  At low concentrations of methanol in ethanol-methanol binary system, the\nmolecular interactions are seen to be uniquely complex. It is observed that the\nethanol aggregates are not strictly hydrogen-bonded complexes; dispersion\nforces also play a dominant role in the self- association of ethanol molecules.\nOn the addition of small amount of methanol to ethanol, the dipolar association\nof ethanol is destroyed. The repulsive forces between the two moieties dominate\nthe behavior of the binary system at lower concentration of methanol. At higher\nconcentration of methanol (> 30%), the strength and extent (number) of\nformation of hydrogen bonds between ethanol and methanol increases. The\ngeometry of molecular structure at high concentration favors the fitting of\ncomponent molecules with each other. Intermolecular interactions in the\nethanol-methanol binary system over the entire concentration range were\ninvestigated in detail using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, FTIR, surface\ntension and refractive index studies. Molecular Dynamics simulations show that\nthe hydrogen bond density is a direct function of the number of methanol\nmolecules present, as the ethanol aggregates are not strictly hydrogen-bond\nconstructed which is in agreement with the experimental results.\n", "  The magnetic phase diagram of the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ has been\ninvestigated by dc magnetisation and ac susceptibility over a very large\nfrequency range from 0.1 Hz up to 1 kHz and temperatures below 50 K.\nQualitatively different phase diagrams have been obtained by applying the\nmagnetic field along the easy $\\langle100\\rangle$ or the hard\n$\\langle110\\rangle$ crystallographic directions. Strong $\\chi\"$ appears close\nto $B_{c2}$, but only below 30 K and is more pronounced when $B$ is applied\nalong $\\langle100\\rangle$. In addition, the transition from the helical to the\nconical phase leads to two adjacent $B_{c1}$ lines below 50 K. The frequency\ndependence of $\\chi\"$ indicates the existence of very broad distributions of\nrelaxation times both at $B_{c1}$ and $B_{c2}$. The associated very long\ncharacteristic times eventually prevent the system from reaching thermal\nequilibrium at low temperatures and lead to thermal hysteresis.\n", "  The size of astronomical observational data is increasing yearly. For\nexample, while Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array is expected to\ngenerate 200 TB raw data every year, Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is\nestimated to produce 15 TB raw data every night. Since the increasing rate of\ncomputing is much lower than that of astronomical data, to provide high\nperformance computing (HPC) resources together with scientific data will be\ncommon in the next decade. However, the installation and maintenance costs of a\nHPC system can be burdensome for the provider. I note public cloud computing\nfor an alternative way to get sufficient computing resources inexpensively. I\nbuild Hadoop and Hive clusters by utilizing a virtual private server (VPS)\nservice and Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR), and measure their performances. The\nVPS cluster behaves differently day by day, while the EMR clusters are\nrelatively stable. Since partitioning is essential for Hive, several\npartitioning algorithms are evaluated. In this paper, I report the results of\nthe benchmarks and the performance optimizations in cloud computing\nenvironment.\n", "  B[e] supergiants and yellow hypergiants share a number of common properties\nregarding their circumstellar environments. Using the forbidden [O I] and [Ca\nII] lines as disk tracers, we suggest the presence of a Keplerian disk or ring\naround the yellow hypergiant V509 Cas and confirm the pole-on inner disk around\nV1302 Aql. These findings indicate a change in mass-loss behavior from\nspherical in cooler yellow hypergiants to axisymmetric in the hotter ones\nduring the passage through the Yellow Void. The accumulation of material in the\nequatorial plane reminds of the disks of B[e] supergiants, supporting the\nsuggestion that yellow hypergiants might appear as B[e] supergiants after they\nreach the blue edge of the yellow instability domain.\n", "  In human relations individuals' gender and age play a key role in the\nstructures and dynamics of their social arrangements. In order to analyze the\ngender preferences of individuals in interaction with others at different\nstages of their lives we study a large mobile phone dataset. To do this we\nconsider four fundamental gender-related caller and callee combinations of\nhuman interactions, namely male to male, male to female, female to male, and\nfemale to female, which together with age, kinship, and different levels of\nfriendship give rise to a wide scope of human sociality. Here we analyse the\nrelative strength of these four types of interaction using a large dataset of\nmobile phone communication records. Our analysis suggests strong age dependence\nfor an ego of one gender choosing to call an individual of either gender. We\nobserve a strong opposite sex bonding across most of their reproductive age.\nHowever, older women show a strong tendency to connect to another female that\nis one generation younger in a way that is suggestive of the\n\\emph{grandmothering effect}. We also find that the relative strength among the\nfour possible interactions depends on phone call duration. For calls of medium\nand long duration, opposite gender interactions are significantly more probable\nthan same gender interactions during the reproductive years, suggesting\npotential emotional exchange between spouses. By measuring the fraction of\ncalls to other generations we find that mothers tend to make calls more to\ntheir daughters than to their sons, whereas fathers make calls more to their\nsons than to their daughters. For younger people, most of their calls go to\nsame generation alters, while older people call the younger people more\nfrequently, which supports the suggestion that \\emph{affection flows downward}.\n", "  Conjugated polymers are complex multi-chromophore systems, with emission\nproperties strongly dependent on the electronic energy transfer through active\nsub-units. Although the packing of the conjugated chains in the solid state is\nknown to be a key factor to tailor the electronic energy transfer and the\nresulting optical properties, most of the current solution-based processing\nmethods do not allow for effectively controlling the molecular order, thus\nmaking the full unveiling of energy transfer mechanisms very complex. Here we\nreport on conjugated polymer fibers with tailored internal molecular order,\nleading to a significant enhancement of the emission quantum yield. Steady\nstate and femtosecond time-resolved polarized spectroscopies evidence that\nexcitation is directed toward those chromophores oriented along the fiber axis,\non a typical timescale of picoseconds. These aligned and more extended\nchromophores, resulting from the high stretching rate and electric field\napplied during the fiber spinning process, lead to improved emission\nproperties. Conjugated polymer fibers are relevant to develop optoelectronic\nplastic devices with enhanced and anisotropic properties.\n", "  Solar photosphere and chromosphere are composed of weakly ionized plasma for\nwhich collisional coupling decreases with height. This implies a breakdown of\nsome hypotheses underlying magnetohydrodynamics at low altitudes and gives rise\nto non-ideal MHD effects such as ambipolar diffusion, Hall effect, etc.\nRecently, there has been progress in understanding the role of these effects\nfor the dynamics and energetics of the solar atmosphere. There are evidences\nthat such phenomena as wave propagation and damping, magnetic reconnection,\nformation of stable magnetic field concentrations, magnetic flux emergence,\netc. can be affected. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art of\nmulti-fluid MHD modeling of the coupled solar atmosphere.\n", "  In this talk we discuss a number of ChPT calculations relevant for lattice\nQCD. These include the finite volume corrections at two-loop order for masses\nand decay constants. The second part is about hadronic vacuum polarization\nwhere we present the two-loop ChPT estimate for the disconnected and strange\nquark contributions. We also present the finite volume corrections at two-loop\norder. The final part is the one-loop finite volume with twisted boundary\nconditions contribution to $f_+(q^2)$ and the full $K_{\\ell3}$ amplitude\n", "  Many real-world networks display a community structure. We study two random\ngraph models that create a network with similar community structure as a given\nnetwork. One model preserves the exact community structure of the original\nnetwork, while the other model only preserves the set of communities and the\nvertex degrees. These models show that community structure is an important\ndeterminant of the behavior of percolation processes on networks, such as\ninformation diffusion or virus spreading: the community structure can both\n\\textit{enforce} as well as \\textit{inhibit} diffusion processes. Our models\nfurther show that it is the mesoscopic set of communities that matters. The\nexact internal structures of communities barely influence the behavior of\npercolation processes across networks. This insensitivity is likely due to the\nrelative denseness of the communities.\n", "  We make use of the formalism described in a previous paper [Martins {\\it et\nal.} Phys. Rev. D90 (2014) 043518] to address general features of wiggly cosmic\nstring evolution. In particular, we highlight the important role played by\npoorly understood energy loss mechanisms and propose a simple ansatz which\ntackles this problem in the context of an extended velocity-dependent one-scale\nmodel. We find a general procedure to determine all the scaling solutions\nadmitted by a specific string model and study their stability, enabling a\ndetailed comparison with future numerical simulations. A simpler comparison\nwith previous Goto-Nambu simulations supports earlier evidence that scaling is\neasier to achieve in the matter era than in the radiation era. In addition, we\nalso find that the requirement that a scaling regime be stable seems to notably\nconstrain the allowed range of energy loss parameters.\n", "  The accuracy of long distance measurement in air is limited by the\nfluctuation of refractive index. In this paper, we propose a technique which\nallows us to measure an absolute distance in air without the knowledge of air\nturbulence. The technique is based on a femtosecond frequency comb. The\nfluctuation of the environmental conditions is monitored by two independently\noperating reference interferometers. The deviations of optical path lengths,\ncaused by the fluctuation of air refractive index, is compensated by feedbacks\nfrom the reference interferometers. The measured optical path length is then\nlocked to certain environmental conditions, determined at an optimized moment\nbefore the measurement process.\n", "  We analyse a relativistic scalar particle with a position-dependent mass in a\nspacetime with a space-like dislocation by showing that relativistic bound\nstates solutions can be achieved. Further, we consider the presence of the\nCoulomb potential and analyse the relativistic position-dependent mass system\nsubject to the Coulomb potential in the spacetime with a space-like\ndislocation. We also show that a new set of relativistic bound states solutions\ncan be obtained, where there also exists the influence of torsion of the\nrelativistic energy levels. Finally, we investigate an analogue of the\nAharonov-Bohm effect for bound states in this position-dependent mass in a\nspacetime with a space-like dislocation.\n", "  We present experimental observations of an anomaly in the coupled response of\nauto-parametrically excited microelectromechanical beams. When one of the two\ncoupled beams is driven at elevated amplitudes, the excitation of dominant and\nrecessive modes is observed in the driven and non-driven beams respectively.\nThis anomalous nature of auto-parametric excitation has been unexplored by both\ntheory and experiments and falls outside the scope of the conventional\ndescription of parametric resonance.\n", "  Neural network models have been used to construct energy landscapes for\nmodeling biological phenomena, in which the minima of the landscape correspond\nto memory patterns stored by the network. Here, we show that dynamic properties\nof those landscapes, such as the sizes of the basins of attraction and the\ndensity of stable and metastable states, depend strongly on the correlations\nbetween the memory patterns and can be altered by introducing hierarchical\nstructures. Our findings suggest dynamic features of energy landscapes can be\ncontrolled by choosing the correlations between patterns\n", "  The interaction of water with TiO2 is crucial to many of its practical\napplications, including photocatalytic water splitting. Following the first\ndemonstration of this phenomenon 40 years ago there have been numerous studies\nof the rutile single-crystal TiO2(110) interface with water. This has provided\nan atomic-level understanding of the water-TiO2 interaction. However, nearly\nall of the previous studies of water/TiO2 interfaces involve water in the\nvapour phase. Here, we explore the interfacial structure between liquid water\nand a rutile TiO2(110) surface pre-characterized at the atomic level. Scanning\ntunnelling microscopy and surface X-ray diffraction are used to determine the\nstructure, which is comprised of an ordered array of hydroxyl molecules with\nmolecular water in the second layer. Static and dynamic density functional\ntheory calculations suggest that a possible mechanism for formation of the\nhydroxyl overlayer involves the mixed adsorption of O2 and H2O on a partially\ndefected surface. The quantitative structural properties derived here provide a\nbasis with which to explore the atomistic properties and hence mechanisms\ninvolved in TiO2 photocatalysis.\n", "  Determining the mechanisms responsible for the heating of the coronal plasma\nand maintaining and accelerating the solar wind are long standing goals in\nsolar physics. There is a clear need to constrain the energy, mass and momentum\nflux through the solar corona and advance our knowledge of the physical process\ncontributing to these fluxes. Furthermore, the accurate forecasting of Space\nWeather conditions at the near-Earth environment and, more generally, the\nplasma conditions of the solar wind throughout the heliosphere, require\ndetailed knowledge of these fluxes in the near-Sun corona. Here we present a\nshort case for a space-based imaging-spectrometer coronagraph, which will have\nthe ability to provide synoptic information on the coronal environment and\nprovide strict constraints on the mass, energy, and momentum flux through the\ncorona. The instrument would ideally achieve cadences of $\\sim10$~s, spatial\nresolution of 1\" and observe the corona out to 2~$R_{\\sun}$. Such an instrument\nwill enable significant progress in our understanding of MHD waves throughout\ncomplex plasmas, as well as potentially providing routine data products to aid\nSpace Weather forecasting.\n", "  Several modes of electroweak radioactive decay require an interaction between\nthe nucleus and bound electrons within the constituent atom. Thus, the\nprobabilities of the respective decays are not only influenced by the structure\nof the initial and final states in the nucleus, but can also depend strongly on\nthe atomic charge. Conditions suitable for the partial or complete ionization\nof these rare isotopes occur naturally in hot, dense astrophysical\nenvironments, but can also be artificially generated in the laboratory to\nselectively block certain radioactive decay modes. Direct experimental studies\non such scenarios are extremely difficult due to the laboratory conditions\nrequired to generate and store radioactive ions at high charge states. A new\nelectron-beam ion trap (EBIT) decay setup with the TITAN experiment at TRIUMF\nhas successfully demonstrated such techniques for performing spectroscopy on\nthe radioactive decay of highly charged ions.\n", "  We present a finite-difference micromagnetic approach for determining the\nnormal modes of spin-waves propagating in extended magnetic films and strips,\nwhich is based on the linearized Landau-Lifshitz equation and uses the dynamic\nmatrix method. The model takes into account both short range exchange\ninteractions and long range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter are\naccounted for through plane-wave dynamic demagnetization factors, which depend\nnot only on the geometry and relative positions of the magnetic cells, as usual\ndemagnetization factors do, but also on the wave vector of the propagating\nwaves. Such a numerical model is most relevant when the spin-wave medium is\nspatially inhomogeneous perpendicular to the direction of propagation, either\nin its magnetic properties or in its equilibrium magnetic configuration. We\nillustrate this point by studying surface spin-waves in magnetic bilayer films\nand spin-waves channelized along magnetic domain walls in perpendicularly\nmagnetized strips. In both cases, dynamic dipolar interactions produce\nnon-reciprocity effects, where counter-propagative spin-waves have different\nfrequencies.\n", "  Long, flexible physical filaments are naturally tangled and knotted, from\nmacroscopic string down to long-chain molecules. The existence of knotting in a\nfilament naturally affects its configuration and properties, and may be very\nstable or disappear rapidly under manipulation and interaction. Knotting has\nbeen previously identified in protein backbone chains, for which these\nmechanical constraints are of fundamental importance to their molecular\nfunctionality, despite their being open curves in which the knots are not\nmathematically well defined; knotting can only be identified by closing the\ntermini of the chain somehow. We introduce a new method for resolving knotting\nin open curves using virtual knots, a wider class of topological objects that\ndo not require a classical closure and so naturally capture the topological\nambiguity inherent in open curves. We describe the results of analysing\nproteins in the Protein Data Bank by this new scheme, recovering and extending\nprevious knotting results, and identifying topological interest in some new\ncases. The statistics of virtual knots in protein chains are compared with\nthose of open random walks and Hamiltonian subchains on cubic lattices,\nidentifying a regime of open curves in which the virtual knotting description\nis likely to be important.\n", "  The most dramatic \"Sommerfeld enhancements\" of neutral-wino-pair annihilation\noccur when the wino mass is tuned to near critical values where there is a\nzero-energy S-wave resonance at the neutral-wino-pair threshold. If the wino\nmass is larger than the critical value, the resonance is a wino-pair bound\nstate. If the wino mass is near a critical value, low-energy winos can be\ndescribed by a zero-range effective field theory in which the winos interact\nnonperturbatively through a contact interaction. The parameters of the\nzero-range effective field theory can be determined by matching wino scattering\namplitudes calculated by solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a\nnonrelativistic effective field theory in which the winos interact through a\npotential due to the exchange of electroweak gauge bosons. The utility of the\nzero-range effective field theory is illustrated by calculating the rate for\nformation of an S-wave bound state in the collision of two neutral winos\nthrough the emission of two soft photons.\n", "  The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) is a free online registry of\nresearch codes; it is indexed by ADS and Web of Science and has over 1300 code\nentries. Its entries are increasingly used to cite software; citations have\nbeen doubling each year since 2012 and every major astronomy journal accepts\ncitations to the ASCL. Codes in the resource cover all aspects of astrophysics\nresearch and many programming languages are represented. In the past year, the\nASCL added dashboards for users and administrators, started minting Digital\nObjective Identifiers (DOIs) for software it houses, and added metadata fields\nrequested by users. This presentation covers the ASCL's growth in the past year\nand the opportunities afforded it as one of the few domain libraries for\nscience research codes.\n", "  Exact equations are derived that relate velocity structure functions of\narbitrary order with other statistics. \"Exact\" means that no approximations are\nused except that the Navier-Stokes equation and incompressibility condition are\nassumed to be accurate. The exact equations are used to determine the\nstructure-function equations of all orders for locally homogeneous but\nanisotropic turbulence as well as for the locally isotropic case. These\nequations can be used for investigating the approach to local homogeneity and\nto local isotropy as well as the balance of the equations and identification of\nscaling ranges.\n", "  I discuss generalized spin-1/2 equations for neutrinos. They have been\nobtained by means of the Gersten's method for derivation of arbitrary-spin\nrelativistic equations. Possible physical consequences are discussed.\n"]}
