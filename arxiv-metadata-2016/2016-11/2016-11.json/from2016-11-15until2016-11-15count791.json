the role of rotational instabilities in the context of black\nhole formation in relativistic stars. In addition to the standard scenario - an\naxially symmetric dynamical instability forming a horizon at the star's center\n- the recently found low-$T/|W|$ instabilities are shown to lead to\nfragmentation and off-center horizon formation in differentially rotating\nstars. This process might be an alternative pathway to produce SMBHs from\nsupermassive stars with inefficient angular momentum transport.\n", "  The historical significance of the problem of relativistic rigid rotation is\nreviewed in light of recently published correspondence between Einstein and the\nmathematician Vladimir Varicak from the years 1909 to 1913.\n", "  A possible equivalence of scalar dark matter, the inflaton, and modified\ngravity is analyzed. After a conformal mapping, the dependence of the effective\nLagrangian on the curvature is not only singular but also bifurcates into\nseveral almost Einsteinian spaces, distinguished only by a different effective\ngravitational strength and cosmological constant. A swallow tail catastrophe in\nthe bifurcation set indicates the possibility for the coexistence of different\nEinsteinian domains in our Universe. This `triple unification' may shed new\nlight on the nature and large scale distribution not only of dark matter but\nalso on `dark energy', regarded as an effective cosmological constant, and\ninflation.\n", "  We review the recently discovered interplay between chaos and symmetry in the\ngeneral inhomogeneous solution of many string-related Einstein-matter systems\nin the vicinity of a cosmological singularity. The\nBelinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz-type chaotic behaviour is found, for many\nEinstein-matter models (notably those related to the low-energy limit of\nsuperstring theory and M-theory), to be connected with certain\n(infinite-dimensional) hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras. In particular, the\nbilliard chambers describing the asymptotic cosmological behaviour of pure\nEinstein gravity in spacetime dimension d+1, or the metric-three-form system of\n11-dimensional supergravity, are found to be identical to the Weyl chambers of\nthe Lorentzian Kac-Moody algebras AE_d, or E_{10}, respectively. This suggests\nthat these Kac-Moody algebras are hidden symmetries of the corresponding\nmodels. There even exists some evidence of a hidden equivalence between the\ngeneral solution of the Einstein-three-form system and a null geodesic in the\ninfinite dimensional coset space E_{10} / K(E_{10}), where K(E_{10}) is the\nmaximal compact subgroup of E_{10}.\n", "  We discuss different arguments that have been raised against the viability of\nthe big trip process, reaching the conclusions that this process can actually\noccur by accretion of phantom energy onto the wormholes and that it is stable\nand might occur in the global context of a multiverse model. We finally argue\nthat the big trip does not contradict any holographic bounds on entropy and\ninformation.\n", "  A brief summary is presented of recent work examining the fate of the\nNambu-Goldstone modes in gravitational theories with spontaneous Lorentz\nviolation.\n", "  Adding 3 right-handed (sterile) neutrino to the Standard Model (SM) can solve\nseveral \"beyond the Standard Model\" problems within one consistent framework:\nexplain neutrino oscillations and baryon asymmetry of the Universe and provide\na dark matter (DM) candidate. In this talk I will present current status of\nastrophysical searches for the DM sterile neutrino.\n", "  In this short talk we review our results from the paper hep-th/0604075 with\nthe main stress on the issues of causality and acoustic metric in eikonal\napproximation. In addition we correct the formula for the redshift of sound\nsignals from our original work. We show that, if there exists a special kind of\nBorn-Infeld type scalar field, then one can send information from inside a\nblack hole. This information is encoded in perturbations of the field\npropagating in non-trivial scalar field backgrounds, which serve as a \"new\nether\". Although the action of the theory is manifestly Lorentz-invariant the\nnon-trivial solutions break this symmetry spontaneously, allowing, the\nsuperluminal propagation of perturbations with respect to this \"new ether\". We\nfound the stationary solution for background, which describes the accretion of\nthe scalar field onto a black hole. Examining the propagation of small\nperturbations around this solution we show that the signals emitted inside the\nSchwarzschild horizon can reach an observer located outside the black hole.\nThus the accreting field forms a hydrodynamical analog of a black hole whose\nhorizon is inside of the gravitational black hole drawing in the scalar field.\n", "  In the present work, an alternative interpretation of the source of\naccelerated expansion of the Universe is suggested. A probable candidate is the\ninteraction between the quantum spin of a moving particle and the torsion of\nspace-time, produced by the background gravitational field of the Universe.\nThis interaction has been suggested by the author in a previous work, with some\nexperimental and observational evidences for its existence. It has been shown\nthat this interaction gives rise to a repulsive force. The accelerated\nexpansion of the Universe may give a further evidence on the existence of this\ninteraction on the cosmological scale.\n", "  We discuss possible origins for discrepancies observed in the radiated\nenergies in head-on collisions of non-spinning binaries starting from\nBrill-Lindquist and superposed Kerr-Schild data. For this purpose, we discuss\nthe impact of different choices of gauge parameters and a small initial boost\nof the black holes.\n", "  As per organizers' request, my talk at the 11th Marcel Grossmann Conference\nconsisted of two parts. In the first, I illustrated recent advances in loop\nquantum gravity through examples. In the second, I presented an overall\nassessment of the status of the program by addressing some frequently asked\nquestions. This account is addressed primarily to researchers outside the loop\nquantum gravity community.\n", "  The Bonami-Beckner hypercontractive inequality is a powerful tool in Fourier\nanalysis of real-valued functions on the Boolean cube. In this paper we present\na version of this inequality for matrix-valued functions on the Boolean cube.\nIts proof is based on a powerful inequality by Ball, Carlen, and Lieb. We also\npresent a number of applications. First, we analyze maps that encode $n$\nclassical bits into $m$ qubits, in such a way that each set of $k$ bits can be\nrecovered with some probability by an appropriate measurement on the quantum\nencoding; we show that if $m<0.7 n$, then the success probability is\nexponentially small in $k$. This result may be viewed as a direct product\nversion of Nayak's quantum random access code bound. It in turn implies strong\ndirect product theorems for the one-way quantum communication complexity of\nDisjointness and other problems. Second, we prove that error-correcting codes\nthat are locally decodable with 2 queries require length exponential in the\nlength of the encoded string. This gives what is arguably the first\n``non-quantum'' proof of a result originally derived by Kerenidis and de Wolf\nusing quantum information theory, and answers a question by Trevisan.\n", "  The existence of a singularity by definition implies a preferred scale--the\naffine parameter distance from/to the singularity of a causal geodesic that is\nused to define it. However, this variable scale is also captured by the\nexpansion along the geodesic, and this can be used to obtain a regularized\nstate space picture by means of a conformal transformation that factors out the\nexpansion. This leads to the conformal `Hubble-normalized' orthonormal frame\napproach which allows one to translate methods and results concerning spatially\nhomogeneous models into the generic inhomogeneous context, which in turn\nenables one to derive the dynamical nature of generic cosmological\nsingularities. Here we describe this approach and outline the derivation of the\n`cosmological billiard attractor,' which describes the generic dynamical\nasymptotic behavior towards a generic spacelike singularity. We also compare\nthe `dynamical systems picture' resulting from this approach with other work on\ngeneric spacelike singularities: the metric approach of Belinskii, Lifschitz,\nand Khalatnikov, and the recent Iwasawa based Hamiltonian method used by\nDamour, Henneaux, and Nicolai; in particular we show that the cosmological\nbilliards obtained by the latter and the cosmological billiard attractor form\ncomplementary `dual' descriptions of the generic asymptotic dynamics of generic\nspacelike singularities.\n", "  We apply the replica method to analyze vector precoding, a method to reduce\ntransmit power in antenna array communications. The analysis applies to a very\ngeneral class of channel matrices. The statistics of the channel matrix enter\nthe transmitted energy per symbol via its R-transform. We find that vector\nprecoding performs much better for complex than for real alphabets. As a\nbyproduct, we find a nonlinear precoding method with polynomial complexity that\noutperforms NP-hard Tomlinson-Harashima precoding for binary modulation on\ncomplex channels if the number of transmit antennas is slightly larger than\ntwice the number of receive antennas.\n", "  A model of topological field theory is presented in which the vacuum coupling\nconstants are topological invariants of the four-dimensional spacetime. Thus\nthe coupling constants are theoretically computable, and they indicate the\ntopological structure of our universe.\n", "  n scalar-tensor theories of gravity with torsion, the gravitational field is\ndescribed in terms of a symmetric metric tensor $g$, a metric-compatible\nconnection $\\nabla$ with torsion, and a scalar field $\\phi$. The main aim is to\nexplore an interaction of a charged perfect fluid and a scalar field $\\phi$ in\na background electromagnetic and gravitational field described by \\{$g$,\n$\\nabla$, $\\phi$\\}. The interaction is based on an action functional $S_C$ of a\ncharged perfect fluid that is invariant under global conformal rescalings.\nUsing a variational principle, we obtain equations of motion for the charged\nperfect fluid. Moreover, we verify that these equations of motion are\nequivalent to the gauge identities obtained from the invariance of an action\nfunctional under spacetime dffeomorphisms and a local U(1) gauge group.\n", "  We study the properties of the shock waves for a viscous accretion flow\nhaving low angular momentum in presence of synchrotron cooling. We present all\npossible accretion solutions in terms of flow parameters. We identify the\nregion of the parameter space for steady and oscillating shocks and show the\neffect of various energy dissipation processes on it. We discuss the role of\nthe shock waves while explaining the observations from black hole candidates.\n", "  In this paper we describe ideas about the string landscape, and how to relate\nit to the physics of the Standard Model of particle physics. First, we give a\nshort status report about heterotic string compactifications. Then we focus on\nthe statistics of D-brane models, on the problem of moduli stabilization, and\nfinally on some attempts to derive a probability wave function in moduli space,\nwhich goes beyond the purely statistical count of string vacua.\n", "  We consider fields in (D>2)-dimensional spacetime, whose potential is r-form\n(skew-symmetric tensor of rank r), the field tensor F being its exterior\nderivative and the Lagrangian, a function of the quadratic invariant I of this\ntensor. It is shown that vector field (r=1) describes electromagnetic field\nonly for D=4. In particular, for D=3 and the Lagrangean L as any function of\nthe above-mentioned invariant, the (r=1)-field has energy-momentum tensor\nidentical with that of a perfect fluid whose equation of state depends on the\nchoice of L(I).\n", "  In this communication we discuss two distinct Zeeman-type gravitomagnetic\neffects deserving attention since they can be easily characterized in their\nexact form, not via approximation procedures. Some observations are also made\non gravitoelectric effects.\n", "  We discuss the problem of wormholes from the viewpoint of gluing together two\nReissner--Nordstr\\\"om-type universes while putting between them a segment of\nthe Nariai-type world (in both cases there are also present electromagnetic\nfields as well as the cosmological constant). Such a toy wormhole represents an\nexample of one-way topological communication free from causal paradoxes, though\ninvolving a travel to next spacetime sheet since one has to cross at least a\npair of horizons through which the spacetimes' junction occurs. We also\nconsider the use of thin shells in these constructions. Such a ``material'' for\nwormholes we choose taking into account specific properties of the\nNariai--Bertotti--Robinson spacetimes.\n", "  An overview is given on those theoretical gravitational lensing results that\ncan be formulated in a spacetime setting, without assuming that the\ngravitational fields are weak and that the bending angles are small. The first\npart is devoted to analytical methods considering spacetimes in which the\nequations for light rays (lightlike geodesics) is completely integrable. This\nincludes spherically symmetric static spacetimes, the Kerr spacetime and plane\ngravitational waves. The second part is devoted to qualitative methods which\ngive some information on lensing properties without actually solving the\nequation for lightlike geodesics. This includes Morse theory, methods from\ndifferential topology and bifurcation theory.\n", "  The properties of several types of Q-stars are studied and compared with\ntheir flat space analogues, i.e. Q-balls. The analysis is based on calculating\nthe mass, global U(1) charge and binding energy for families of solutions\nparametrized by the central value of the scalar field. The two most frequently\nused Q-star models (differing by their potential term) are studied. Although\nthere are general similarities between both Q-star types, there are important\ndifferences as well as new features with respect to the non-gravitating\nsystems. We find non-solitonic solutions which do not have a flat space limit,\nin the weak (scalar) field region as well as in the opposite region of strong\ncentral scalar field for which there does not exist Q-ball solutions at all.\n", "  A highly accurate multi-domain spectral method is used to study axially\nsymmetric and stationary spacetimes containing a black hole or disc of dust\nsurrounded by a ring of matter. It is shown that the matter ring can affect the\nproperties of the central object drastically. In particular, by virtue of the\nring's frame dragging, the so-called Komar mass of the black hole or disc can\nbecome negative. A continuous transition from such discs to such black holes\ncan be found.\n", "  Analytic approximations for the stress-energy of quantized fields in the\nHartle-Hawking state in static black hole spacetimes predict divergences on the\nevent horizon of the black hole for a number of important cases. Such\ndivergences, if real, could substantially alter the spacetime geometry near the\nevent horizon, possibly preventing the black hole from existing. The results of\nthree investigations of these types of effects are presented. The first\ninvolves a new analytic approximation for conformally invariant fields in\nReissner-Nordstrom spacetimes which is finite on the horizon. The second\nfocuses on the stress-energy of massless scalar fields in Schwarzschild-de\nSitter black holes. The third focuses on the stress-energy of massless scalar\nfields in zero temperature black hole geometries that could be solutions to the\nsemiclassical backreaction equations near the event horizon of the black hole.\n", "  A brief sketch of the formulation of the monodromy transform approach and\ncorresponding integral equation methods as well as of various applications of\nthis approach for solution of integrable symmetry reductions of Einstein's\nfield equations is presented.\n", "  In this paper we present a 5-parametric family of static asymptotically flat\nsolutions for the superposed gravitational and electromagnetic fields of two\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om sources with arbitrary parameters -- masses, charges and\nseparating distance. A procedure for solving of the linear singular integral\nequation form of the electrovacuum Einstein - Maxwell equations for stationary\naxisymmetric fields is described in detail. The 4-parametric family of\nequilibrium configurations of two Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om sources (one of which\nshould be a black hole and another one -- a naked singularity) presented in our\nrecent paper \\cite{Alekseev-Belinski:2007} arises after a restriction of the\nparameters of the 5-parametric solution presented here by the equilibrium\ncondition which provides the absence in the solution of conical points on the\nsymmetry axis between the sources.\n", "  We consider the possible effects of gravitational lensing by globular\nclusters on gravitational waves from asymmetric neutron stars in our galaxy. In\nthe lensing of gravitational waves, the long wavelength, compared with the\nusual case of optical lensing, can lead to the geometrical optics approximation\nbeing invalid, in which case a wave optical solution is necessary. In general,\nwave optical solutions can only be obtained numerically. We describe a\ncomputational method that is particularly well suited to numerical wave optics.\nThis method enables us to compare the properties of several lens models for\nglobular clusters without ever calling upon the geometrical optics\napproximation, though that approximation would sometimes have been valid.\nFinally, we estimate the probability that lensing by a globular cluster will\nsignificantly affect the detection, by ground-based laser interferometer\ndetectors such as LIGO, of gravitational waves from an asymmetric neutron star\nin our galaxy, finding that the probability is insignificantly small.\n", "  We investigate the Casimir energy between two dissipative mirrors in term of\na sum over mode formula which can be interpreted by analogy to a quantum\ndissipative oscillator. We also show that metamaterials engineered at scales\nbetween the nanometer and the micron seem a promising way to achieve a\nrepulsive force.\n", "  We give a lower bound on the probability of error in quantum state\ndiscrimination. The bound is a weighted sum of the pairwise fidelities of the\nstates to be distinguished.\n", "  The relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) found\nin their cores plays a key role in the formation and evolution of both of these\nmajor constituents of the universe, as well as the evolution of the\nintergalactic medium. Neither can be fully understood on their own, and studies\nof galaxy and SMBH co-formation and co-evolution are now among the central\ntopics of research in cosmology. Yet the very origins, and the early growth\nphases of the SMBH are still not firmly established. We review our current\nunderstanding of the relevant processes and their astrophysical and\ncosmological context, with an emphasis on the observability of the SMBH growth\nmechanisms at high redshifts, and their leftover progeny at low redshifts.\n", "  This paper investigates the evolution of a void and an adjacent galaxy\nsupercluster. For this purpose the quasispherical Szekeres model is employed.\nThe Szekeres model is an exact solution of the Einstein field equations. In\nthis way investigations of the evolution of the cosmic structures presented\nhere can be freed from such assumptions as small amplitude of the density\ncontrast. Studying the evolution of a void and an adjacent supercluster results\nnot only in better understanding the evolution of cosmic structures but also in\nacquainting us with the Szekeres model.\n  The main results include the conclusion that small voids surrounded by large\noverdensities evolve slower than large, isolated voids do. On the other hand,\nlarge voids enhance the evolution of adjacent superclusters which evolve much\nfaster than isolated galaxy superclusters.\n", "  The ADM formalism for two-point-mass systems in $d$ space dimensions is\nsketched. It is pointed out that the regularization ambiguities of the 3rd\npost-Newtonian ADM Hamiltonian considered directly in $d=3$ space dimensions\ncan be cured by dimensional continuation (to complex $d$'s), which leads to a\nfinite and unique Hamiltonian as $d\\to3$. Some so far unpublished details of\nthe dimensional-continuation computation of the 3rd post-Newtonian\ntwo-point-mass ADM Hamiltonian are presented.\n", "  We here re-examine the validity of the constant-index power-law relation\nbetween the fireshell Lorentz gamma factor and its radial coordinate, usually\nadopted in the current Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) literature on the grounds of an\n\"ultrarelativistic\" approximation. Such expressions are found to be\nmathematically correct but only approximately valid in a very limited range of\nthe physical and astrophysical parameters and in an asymptotic regime which is\nreached only for a very short time, if any.\n", "  Within the \"fireshell\" model we define a \"canonical GRB\" light curve with two\nsharply different components: the Proper-GRB (P-GRB), emitted when the\noptically thick fireshell of electron-positron plasma originating the\nphenomenon reaches transparency, and the afterglow, emitted due to the\ncollision between the remaining optically thin fireshell and the CircumBurst\nMedium (CBM). We here present the consequences of such a scenario on the\ntheoretical interpretation of the nature of \"long\" and \"short\" GRBs.\n", "  We show how an emission endowed with an instantaneous thermal spectrum in the\nco-moving frame of the expanding fireshell can reproduce the time-integrated\nGRB observed non-thermal spectrum. An explicit example in the case of GRB\n031203 is presented.\n", "  (Shortened) We show by example how the uncoding of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)\noffers unprecedented possibilities to foster new knowledge in fundamental\nphysics and in astrophysics. After recalling some of the classic work on vacuum\npolarization in uniform electric fields by Klein, Sauter, Heisenberg, Euler and\nSchwinger, we summarize some of the efforts to observe these effects in heavy\nions and high energy ion collisions. We then turn to the theory of vacuum\npolarization around a Kerr-Newman black hole, leading to the extraction of the\nblackholic energy, to the concept of dyadosphere and dyadotorus, and to the\ncreation of an electron-positron-photon plasma. We then present a new\ntheoretical approach encompassing the physics of neutron stars and heavy\nnuclei. It is shown that configurations of nuclear matter in bulk with global\ncharge neutrality can exist on macroscopic scales and with electric fields\nclose to the critical value near their surfaces. These configurations may\nrepresent an initial condition for the process of gravitational collapse,\nleading to the creation of an electron-positron-photon plasma: the basic\nself-accelerating system explaining both the energetics and the high energy\nLorentz factor observed in GRBs. We then turn to recall the two basic\ninterpretational paradigms of our GRB model. [...] We then turn to the special\nrole of the baryon loading in discriminating between \"genuine\" short and long\nor \"fake\" short GRBs [...] We finally turn to the GRB-Supernova Time Sequence\n(GSTS) paradigm: the concept of induced gravitational collapse. [...] We then\npresent some general conclusions.\n", "  Based on the Thomas-Fermi approach, we describe and distinguish the electron\ndistributions around extended nuclear cores: (i) in the case that cores are\nneutral for electrons bound by protons inside cores and proton and electron\nnumbers are the same; (ii) in the case that super charged cores are bare,\nelectrons (positrons) produced by vacuum polarization are bound by (fly into)\ncores (infinity).\n", "  We show the preliminary results of the application of our \"fireshell\" model\nto GRB060124. This source is very peculiar because it is the first event for\nwhich both the prompt and the afterglow emission were observed simultaneously\nby the three Swift instruments: BAT (15-350 keV), XRT (0.2-10 keV) and UVOT\n(170-650 nm), due to the presence of a precursor ~ 570 s before the main burst.\nWe analyze GRB060124 within our \"canonical\" GRB scenario, identifying the\nprecursor with the P-GRB and the prompt emission with the afterglow peak\nemission. In this way we reproduce correctly the energetics of both these two\ncomponents. We reproduce also the observed time delay between the precursor\n(P-GRB) and the main burst. The effect of such a time delay in our model will\nbe discussed.\n", "  We introduce a stochastic model for the determination of phase noise in\noptoelectronic oscillators. After a short overview of the main results for the\nphase diffusion approach in autonomous oscillators, an extension is proposed\nfor the case of optoelectronic oscillators where the microwave is a limit-cycle\noriginated from a bifurcation induced by nonlinearity and time-delay. This\nLangevin approach based on stochastic calculus is also successfully confronted\nwith experimental measurements.\n", "  Reformulation of the Dirac equation in terms of the real Spacetime Algebra\n(STA) reveals hidden geometric structure, including a geometric role for the\nunit imaginary as generator of rotations in a spacelike plane. The STA and the\nreal Dirac equation play essential roles in a new Gauge Theory Gravity (GTG)\nversion of General Relativity (GR). Besides clarifying the conceptual\nfoundations of GR and facilitating complex computations, GTG opens up new\npossibilities for a unified gauge theory of gravity and quantum mechanics,\nincluding spacetime geometry of electroweak interactions. The Weinberg-Salam\nmodel fits perfectly into this geometric framework, and a promising variant\nthat replaces chiral states with Majorana states is formulated to incorporate\nzitterbewegung in electron states.\n", "  According to the recent astronomical data, the most part of energy in the\nUniverse is in the 'dark' form, which is effectively described by Lambda-term\nin Einstein equations. All arguments in favor of the dark energy were obtained\nso far from the observational data related to very large (intergalactic)\nscales. Is it possible to find a manifestation of the dark energy at much less\nscales (e.g. inside the Solar system)?\n", "  After a brief non technical introduction of the basic properties of strange\nquark matter (SQM) in compact stars, we consider some of the late important\nadvances in the field, and discuss some recent astrophysical observational data\nthat could shed new light on the possible presence of SQM in compact stars. We\nshow that above a threshold value of the gravitational mass a neutron star\n(pure hadronic star) is metastable to the decay (conversion) to an hybrid\nneutron star or to a strange star. We explore the consequences of the\nmetastability of \"massive\" neutron stars and of the existence of stable compact\n\"quark\" stars (hybrid neutron stars or strange stars) on the concept of\nlimiting mass of compact stars, and we give an extension of this concept with\nrespect to the \"classical\" one given in 1939 by Oppenheimer and Volkoff.\n", "  A resonant chiral tunneling (CT) across a graphene junction (GJ) induced by\nan external electromagnetic field (EF) is studied. Modulation of the electron\nand hole wavefunction phases $\\varphi$ by the external EF during the CT\nprocesses strongly impacts the CT directional diagram. Therefore the a.c.\ntransport characteristics of GJs depend on the EF polarization and frequency\nconsiderably. The GJ shows great promises for various nanoelectronic\napplications working in the THz diapason.\n", "  We here investigate the model of interacting dark energy in the context of\nfive dimensional brane cosmology. The effective equations of state of dark\nenergy are evaluated for various choices of the variable time dependent\ncosmological constant. We have found that the interacting dark energy obeys the\nphantom divide/crossing scenario in this generalized model. It is also shown\nthat interacting dark energy in this generalized model also resolves the cosmic\ncoincidence problem.\n", "  Symmetries of geometrical and physical quantities in general relativity\nprovide important information about the curvature structure of the spacetimes.\nSymmetries of the curvature and the Weyl tensors, known as curvature and Weyl\ncollineations respectively, are two of such important symmetries. Some results\non these symmetries for Bianchi type V spacetimes are discussed.\n", "  Conformal Killing vectors (CKVs) preserve the spacetime metric up to a\nfactor. Homothetic vectors and Killing vectors are special cases of CKVs.\nClassification of some classes of spacetimes on the basis of CKVs give\ninteresting results showing how homothetic and Killing vectors which form\nsubsets of the set of CKVs can be recovered as a result of the above\nclassification.\n", "  It is widely assumed that the observed reduction of the magnetic field of\nmillisecond pulsars can be connected to the accretion phase during which the\npulsar is spun up by mass accretion from a companion. A wide variety of\nreduction mechanisms have been proposed, including the burial of the field by a\nmagnetic mountain, formed when the accreted matter is confined to the poles by\nthe tension of the stellar magnetic field. A magnetic mountain effectively\nscreens the magnetic dipole moment. On the other hand, observational data\nsuggests that accreting neutron stars are sources of gravitational waves, and\nmagnetic mountains are a natural source of a time-dependent quadrupole moment.\nWe show that the emission is sufficiently strong to be detectable by current\nand next generation long-baseline interferometers. Preliminary results from\nfully three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are presented. We\nfind that the initial axisymmetric state relaxes into a nearly axisymmetric\nconfiguration via toroidal magnetic modes. A substantial quadrupole moment is\nstill present in the final state, which is stable (in ideal MHD) yet highly\ndistorted.\n", "  We present results from a detailed GEANT4 simulation of a proposed Muon\nTomography System that employs compact Micro Pattern Gas Detectors with high\nspatial resolution. A basic Point-Of-Closest-Approach algorithm is applied to\nreconstructed muon tracks for forming 3D tomographic images of interrogated\ntargets. Criteria for discriminating materials by Z and discrimination power\nachieved by the technique for simple scenarios are discussed for different\nintegration times. The simulation shows that Muon Tomography can clearly\ndistinguish high-Z material from low-Z and medium-Z material. We have studied\nvarious systematic effects that affect the performance of the MT and the\ndiscrimination power. The implications of the simulation results for the\nplanned development of a prototype MT station are discussed.\n", "  The charge and potential distributions for insulating particles approaching a\nsubstrate with regular insulating structures are studied by particle-in-cell\nnumerical simulations. An elongated particle and substrate with elongated\nstructures are considered for flowing plasmas. The role of the relative\nposition of the particle and the substrate in their interactions is\ninvestigated. It is also demonstrated that the interactions are modified by\nphotoemission due to directed UV light. The simulations are two dimensional\nwith ions and electrons treated as individual particles.\n", "  We consider the prospects for probing low-mass dark matter with the\nSuper-Kamiokande experiment. We show that upcoming analyses including\nfully-contained events with sensitivity to dark matter masses from 5 to 10 GeV\ncan test the dark matter interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal. We consider\nprospects of this analysis for two light dark matter candidates: neutralinos\nand WIMPless dark matter.\n", "  We review the phenomenology of gravitino dark matter within supergravity\nframework. Gravitino can be dark matter if it is the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, which is stable if R-parity is conserved. There are several distinct\nscenarios depending on what the next to lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP)\nis. We discuss the constraints and summarize the phenomenology of neutralino,\nstau, stop and sneutrino NLSPs.\n", "  Motivated by the recent results from the PAMELA and ATIC, we study the\ncosmic-ray electron and positron produced by the decay of gravitino dark\nmatter. We calculate the cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes and discuss\nimplications to the PAMELA and ATIC data. In this paper, we will show that the\nobserved anomalous fluxes by the PAMELA and ATIC can be explained in such a\nscenario. We will also discuss the synchrotron radiation flux from the Galactic\ncenter in such a scenario.\n", "  Recent measurements of cosmic-ray electron and positron fluxes by PAMELA and\nATIC experiments may indicate the existence of annihilating dark matter with\nlarge annihilation cross section. We discuss its possible relation to other\nastrophysical/cosmological observations : gamma-rays, neutrinos, and big-bang\nnucleosynthesis. It is shown that they give stringent constraints on some\nannihilating dark matter models.\n", "  The Elko field of Ahluwalia and Grumiller is a quantum field for massive\nspin-1/2 particles. It has been suggested as a candidate for dark matter. We\ndiscuss our attempts to interpret the Elko field as a quantum field in the\nsense of Weinberg. Our work suggests that one should investigate quantum fields\nbased on representations of the full Poincar\\'e group which belong to one of\nthe non-standard Wigner classes.\n", "  We announce the public release of the 'dark' stellar evolution code\nDarkStars. The code simultaneously solves the equations of WIMP capture and\nannihilation in a star with those of stellar evolution assuming approximate\nhydrostatic equilibrium. DarkStars includes the most extensive WIMP\nmicrophysics of any dark evolution code to date. The code employs detailed\ntreatments of the capture process from a range of WIMP velocity distributions,\nas well as composite WIMP distribution and conductive energy transport schemes\nbased on the WIMP mean-free path in the star. We give a brief description of\nthe input physics and practical usage of the code, as well as examples of its\napplication to dark stars at the Galactic centre.\n", "  We analyze some generic properties of the dark energy (DE) perturbations, in\nthe case of a self-conserved DE fluid. We also apply a simple test (the\n\"F-test\") to compare a model to the data on large scale structure (LSS) under\nthe assumption of negligible DE perturbations. We exemplify our discussions by\nmeans of the LXCDM model, showing that it provides a viable solution to the\ncosmological coincidence problem.\n", "  In a dense cloud of massive fermions interacting by exchange of a light\nscalar field, the effective mass of the fermion can become negligibly small. As\nthe cloud expands, the effective mass and the total energy density eventually\nincrease with decreasing density. In this regime, the pressure-density relation\ncan approximate that required for dark energy. We apply this phenomenon to the\nexpansion of the Universe with a very light scalar field and infer relations\nbetween the parameters available and cosmological observations. Majorana\nneutrinos at a mass that may have been recently determined, and fermions such\nas the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP) may both be consistent with\ncurrent observations of dark energy.\n", "  After summarizing the respective merits of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) paradigms in various stellar systems, we\ninvestigate the possibility that a non-standard interaction between baryonic\nand dark matter could reproduce the successes of CDM at extragalactic scales\nwhile making baryonic matter effectively obey the MOND field equation in spiral\ngalaxies.\n", "  In these proceedings, we report on the possible signatures of a light scalar\nWIMP, a dark matter candidate with M_DM ~ few GeV, which is supposed to\ninteract with the Standard Model particles through the Higgs, and which might\nbe related to the annual modulation observed by DAMA.\n", "  The fundamental security and efficiency considerations for fresh key\ngeneration will be described. It is shown that the attacker's optimal\nprobability of finding the generated key is an indispensable measure of\nsecurity and that this probability limits the possibility of privacy\namplification and the amount of fresh key that can be generated. A new approach\nto quantum cryptography to be called KCQ, keyed communication in quantum noise,\nis developed on the basis of quantum detection and communication theory for\nclassical information transmission. KCQ key generation schemes with coherent\nstates of considerable energy will be described. The possibility of fresh key\ngeneration is demonstrated for binary and N-ary detection systems under\nheterodyne attacks. The security issues of these schemes will be discussed and\ncompared with BB84. The emphasis throughout is on concrete finite bit-length\nprotocols.\n", "  The Hubble relation between distance and redshift is a purely cosmographic\nrelation that depends only on the symmetries of a FLRW spacetime, but does not\nintrinsically make any dynamical assumptions. This suggests that it should be\npossible to estimate the parameters defining the Hubble relation without making\nany dynamical assumptions. To test this idea, we perform a number of\ninter-related cosmographic fits to the legacy05 and gold06 supernova datasets,\npaying careful attention to the systematic uncertainties. Based on this\nsupernova data, the \"preponderance of evidence\" certainly suggests an\naccelerating universe. However we would argue that (unless one uses additional\ndynamical and observational information, and makes additional theoretical\nassumptions) this conclusion is not currently supported \"beyond reasonable\ndoubt\". As part of the analysis we develop two particularly transparent\ngraphical representations of the redshift-distance relation -- representations\nin which acceleration versus deceleration reduces to the question of whether\nthe relevant graph slopes up or down.\n", "  Graphene is a relatively new material (2004) made of atomic layers of carbon\narranged in a honeycomb lattice. Josephson junction devices are made from\ngraphene by depositing two parallel superconducting leads on a graphene flake.\nThese devices have hysteretic current-voltage characteristics with a\nsupercurrent branch and Shapiro steps appear when irradiated with microwaves.\nThese properties motivate us to investigate the presence of quantum metastable\nstates similar to those found in conventional current-biased Josephson\njunctions. We present work investigating the nature of these metastable states\nfor ballistic graphene Josephson junctions. We model the effective Washboard\npotential for these devices and estimate parameters, such as energy level\nspacing and critical currents, to deduce the design needed to observe\nmetastable states. We propose devices consisting of a parallel on-chip\ncapacitor and suspended graphene. The capacitor is needed to lower the energy\nlevel spacing down to the experimentally accessible range of 1-20 GHz. The\nsuspended graphene helps reduce the noise that may otherwise come from\ntwo-level states in the insulating oxide layer. Moreover, back-gate voltage\ncontrol of its critical current introduces another knob for quantum control. We\nwill also report on current experimental progress in the area of fabrication of\nthis proposed device.\n", "  A new approach to distributed cooperative beamforming in relay networks with\nfrequency selective fading is proposed. It is assumed that all the relay nodes\nare equipped with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and use a\nfilter-and-forward (FF) strategy to compensate for the transmitter-to-relay and\nrelay-to-destination channels.\n  Three relevant half-duplex distributed beamforming problems are considered.\nThe first problem amounts to minimizing the total relay transmitted power\nsubject to the destination quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In the second\nand third problems, the destination QoS is maximized subject to the total and\nindividual relay transmitted power constraints, respectively. For the first and\nsecond problems, closed-form solutions are obtained, whereas the third problem\nis solved using convex optimization. The latter convex optimization technique\ncan be also directly extended to the case when the individual and total power\nconstraints should be jointly taken into account. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that in the frequency selective fading case, the proposed FF\napproach provides substantial performance improvements as compared to the\ncommonly used amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming strategy.\n", "  This paper introduces a space-continuous force-based model for simulating\npedestrian dynamics. The main interest of this work is the quantitative\ndescription of pedestrian movement through a bottleneck. Measurements of flow\nand density will be presented and compared with empirical data. The results of\nthe proposed model show a good agreement with empirical data. Furthermore, we\nemphasize the importance of volume exclusion in force-based models.\n", "  Analytical and numerical results on equilibrium configurations of rotating\nfluid bodies within Einstein's theory of gravitation are reviewed. Particular\nemphasis is placed on continuous parametric transitions to black holes. In this\nconnection the uniqueness of extremal Kerr black holes is discussed.\n", "  This paper focuses on the analysis of the gravitational instability in\npresence of bulk viscosity both in Newtonian regime and in the\nfully-relativistic approach. The standard Jeans Mechanism and the\nQuasi-Isotropic Solution are treated expressing the bulk-viscosity coefficient\n$\\zeta$ as a power-law of the fluid energy density $\\rho$, i.e.,\n$\\zeta=\\zo\\rho^{s}$. In the Newtonian regime, the perturbation evolution is\nfounded to be damped by viscosity and the top-down mechanism of structure\nfragmentation is suppressed. The value of the Jeans Mass remains unchanged also\nin presence of viscosity. In the relativistic approach, we get a power-law\nsolution existing only in correspondence to a restricted domain of $\\zo$.\n", "  I report on some scenarios where the gravitino is the dark matter and the\nsupersymmetry breaking mediated by a gauge sector.\n", "  We discuss the capability of a third-generation ground-based detector such as\nthe Einstein Telescope to detect mergers of intermediate-mass black holes that\nmay have formed through runaway stellar collisions in globular clusters. We\nfind that detection rates of 500 events per year are plausible.\n", "  We present a brief overview of the stability analysis of the Einstein static\nuniverse in various modified theories of gravity, like f(R) gravity,\nGauss-Bonnet or f(G) gravity, and Horava-Lifshitz gravity.\n", "  We derive the higher dimensional generalization of Penrose-Tod equation\ndescribing past horizon in Robinson-Trautman spacetimes with a cosmological\nconstant and pure radiation. Results for D=4 dimensions are summarized.\nExistence of its solutions in D>4 dimensions is proved using tools for\nnonlinear elliptic partial differential equations.\n", "  We report on the high precision timing analysis of the pulsar-white dwarf\nbinary PSR J1012+5307. Using 15 years of multi-telescope data from the European\nPulsar Timing Array (EPTA) network, a significant measurement of the variation\nof the orbital period is obtained. Using this ideal strong-field gravity\nlaboratory we derive theory independent limits for both the dipole radiation\nand the variation of the gravitational constant.\n", "  The SAGACE experiment consists of a mm/sub-mm telescope with a 3-m diameter\nprimary mirror, coupled to a cryogenic multi-beam differential spectrometer.\nSAGACE explores the sky in the 100-760 GHz frequency range, using four\ndiffraction-limited bolometer arrays. The instrument is designed to perform\nspectroscopic surveys of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects of thousands of galaxy\nclusters, of the spectral energy distribution of active galactic nuclei, and of\nthe [CII] line of a thousand galaxies in the redshift desert. In 2008 a full\nphase-A study for a national small mission was completed and delivered to the\nItalian Space Agency (ASI). We have shown that taking advantage of the\ndifferential operation of the Fourier Transform Spectrometer, this ambitious\ninstrument can operate from a Molniya orbit, and can be built and operated\nwithin the tight budget of a small mission.\n", "  The lack of structure greater than 10 Gpc/h in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) favours\ncompact Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models of the Universe. The\npresent best candidates based on observations are the Poincare dodecahedral\nspace S^3/I^* and the 3-torus T^3. The residual gravity effect favours the\nPoincare space, while a measure space argument where the density parameter is a\nderived parameter favours flat spaces almost surely.\n", "  Solutions of the Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmological equations of general\nrelativity have been found with finite-time singularities that are everywhere\nregular, have regular Hubble expansion rate, and obey the strong-energy\nconditions but possess pressure and acceleration singularities at finite time\nthat are not associated with geodesic incompleteness. We show how these\nsolutions with sudden singularities can be constructed using fractional series\nmethods and find the limiting form of the equation of state on approach to the\nsingularity.\n", "  Since 1908, when Mie reported analytical expressions for the fields scattered\nby a spherical particle upon incidence of an electromagnetic plane-wave,\ngeneralizing his analysis to the case of an arbitrary incident wave has proved\nelusive. This is due to the presence of certain radially-dependent terms in the\nequation for the beam-shape coefficients of the expansion of the\nelectromagnetic fields in terms of vector spherical wave functions. Here we\nshow for the first time how these terms can be canceled out, allowing\nanalytical expressions for the beam shape coefficients to be found for a\ncompletely arbitrary incident field. We give several examples of how this new\nmethod, which is well suited to numerical calculation, can be used. Analytical\nexpressions are found for Bessel beams and the modes of rectangular and\ncylindrical metallic waveguides. The results are highly relevant for speeding\nup calculation of the radiation forces acting on small spherical particles\nplaced in an arbitrary electromagnetic field, for example in optical tweezers.\n", "  The Large Area Telescope on the Fermi gamma-ray Space Telescope provides\nunprecedented sensitivity for all-sky monitoring of gamma-ray activity. It has\ndetected a few Galactic sources, including 2 gamma-ray binaries and a\nmicroquasar. In addition, it is an adequate telescope to detect other transient\nsources. The observatory scans the entire sky every three hours and allows a\ngeneral search for flaring activity on daily timescales. This search is\nconducted automatically as part of the ground processing of the data and allows\na fast response to transient events, typically less than a day. Most of the\noutbursts detected are spatially associated with known blazars, but in several\ncases during the first years of observations, gamma-ray flares occurring near\nthe Galactic plane did not reveal any initially compelling counterparts. This\nprompted follow-up observations in X-ray, optical, and radio to attempt to\nidentify the origin of the emission and probe the possible existence of a class\nof transient gamma-ray sources in the Galaxy. Here we report on these LAT\nevents and the results of the multiwavelength counterpart searches.\n", "  We study the gravitational dynamics in the early inspiral phase of coalescing\ncompact binaries using Non-Relativistic General Relativity (NRGR) - an\neffective field theory formalism based on the post-newtonian expansion, but\nwhich provides a consistent lagrangian framework and a systematic way in which\nto study binary dynamics and gravitational wave emission. We calculate in this\nframework the spin-orbit correction to the newtonian potential at 2.5 PN.\n", "  The proliferation of commercial cloud computing providers has generated\nsignificant interest in the scientific computing community. Much recent\nresearch has attempted to determine the benefits and drawbacks of cloud\ncomputing for scientific applications. Although clouds have many attractive\nfeatures, such as virtualization, on-demand provisioning, and \"pay as you go\"\nusage-based pricing, it is not clear whether they are able to deliver the\nperformance required for scientific applications at a reasonable price. In this\npaper we examine the performance and cost of clouds from the perspective of\nscientific workflow applications. We use three characteristic workflows to\ncompare the performance of a commercial cloud with that of a typical HPC\nsystem, and we analyze the various costs associated with running those\nworkflows in the cloud. We find that the performance of clouds is not\nunreasonable given the hardware resources provided, and that performance\ncomparable to HPC systems can be achieved given similar resources. We also find\nthat the cost of running workflows on a commercial cloud can be reduced by\nstoring data in the cloud rather than transferring it from outside.\n", "  Nuclear double beta decay, an extremely rare radioactive decay process, is -\nin one of its variants - one of the most exciting means of research into\nparticle physics beyond the standard model. The large progress in sensitivity\nof experiments searching for neutrinoless double beta decay in the last two\ndecades - based largely on the use of large amounts of enriched source material\nin \"active source experiments\" - has lead to the observation of the occurrence\nof this process in nature (on a 6.4 sigma level), with the largest half-life\never observed for a nuclear decay process (2.2 x 10^{25} y). This has\nfundamental consequences for particle physics - violation of lepton number,\nMajorana nature of the neutrino. These results are independent of any\ninformation on nuclear matrix elements (NME)*. It further leads to sharp\nrestrictions for SUSY theories, sneutrino mass, right-handed W-boson mass,\nsuperheavy neutrino masses, compositeness, leptoquarks, violation of Lorentz\ninvariance and equivalence principle in the neutrino sector. The masses of\nlight-neutrinos are found to be degenerate, and to be at least 0.22 +- 0.02 eV.\nThis fixes the contribution of neutrinos as hot dark matter to >=4.7% of the\ntotal observed dark matter. The neutrino mass determined might solve also the\ndark energy puzzle. *(It is briefly discussed how important NME for 0nubb decay\nreally are.)\n", "  Inspired by biological communication systems, molecular communication has\nbeen proposed as a viable scheme to communicate between nano-sized devices\nseparated by a very short distance. Here, molecules are released by the\ntransmitter into the medium, which are then sensed by the receiver. This paper\ndevelops a preliminary version of such a communication system focusing on the\nrelease of either one or two molecules into a fluid medium with drift. We\nanalyze the mutual information between transmitter and the receiver when\ninformation is encoded in the time of release of the molecule. Simplifying\nassumptions are required in order to calculate the mutual information, and\ntheoretical results are provided to show that these calculations are upper\nbounds on the true mutual information. Furthermore, optimized degree\ndistributions are provided, which suggest transmission strategies for a variety\nof drift velocities.\n", "  In this paper, we consider quantum error correction over depolarizing\nchannels with non-binary low-density parity-check codes defined over Galois\nfield of size $2^p$ . The proposed quantum error correcting codes are based on\nthe binary quasi-cyclic CSS (Calderbank, Shor and Steane) codes. The resulting\nquantum codes outperform the best known quantum codes and surpass the\nperformance limit of the bounded distance decoder. By increasing the size of\nthe underlying Galois field, i.e., $2^p$, the error floors are considerably\nimproved.\n", "  We draw relationships between the generalized data processing theorems of\nZakai and Ziv (1973 and 1975) and the dynamical version of the second law of\nthermodynamics, a.k.a. the Boltzmann H-Theorem, which asserts that the Shannon\nentropy, $H(X_t)$, pertaining to a finite--state Markov process $\\{X_t\\}$, is\nmonotonically non-decreasing as a function of time $t$, provided that the\nsteady-state distribution of this process is uniform across the state space\n(which is the case when the process designates an isolated system). It turns\nout that both the generalized data processing theorems and the Boltzmann\nH-Theorem can be viewed as special cases of a more general principle concerning\nthe monotonicity (in time) of a certain generalized information measure applied\nto a Markov process. This gives rise to a new look at the generalized data\nprocessing theorem, which suggests to exploit certain degrees of freedom that\nmay lead to better bounds, for a given choice of the convex function that\ndefines the generalized mutual information.\n", "  Cosmologists are just beginning to probe the properties of the cosmic vacuum\nand its role in reversing the attractive pull of gravity to cause an\nacceleration in the expansion of the cosmos. The cause of this acceleration is\ngiven the generic name of dark energy, whether it is due to a true vacuum, a\nfalse, temporary vacuum, or a new relation between the vacuum and the force of\ngravity. Despite the common name, the distinction between these origins is of\nutmost interest and physicists are actively engaged in finding ways to use\ncosmological observations to distinguish which is the true, new physics. Here\nwe will discuss how to relate the theoretical ideas to the experimental\nconstraints, how to understand the influences of dark energy on the expansion\nand structure in the universe, and what frontiers of new physics are being\nilluminated by current and near-term data.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of recently proposed holographic models of\ninflation, in which the very early universe is non-geometric and is described\nby a dual three-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT). We analyze models\ndetermined by a specific class of dual QFTs and show that they have the\nfollowing universal properties: (i) they have a nearly scale invariant spectrum\nof small amplitude primordial fluctuations, (ii) the scalar spectral index runs\nas alpha_s = -(n_s-1), (iii) the three-point function of primordial scalar\nperturbations is of exactly the factorizable equilateral form with\nf_nl^eq=5/36. These properties hold irrespective of the details (e.g. field\ncontent, strength of interactions, etc.) of the dual QFT within the class of\ntheories we analyze. The ratio of tensors-to-scalars is determined by the field\ncontent of the dual QFT and does not satisfy the slow-roll consistency\nrelations. Observations from the Planck satellite should be able to confirm or\nexclude these models.\n", "  In this article we review the discovery of the accelerating universe using\ntype Ia supernovae. We then outline ways in which dark energy - component that\ncauses the acceleration - is phenomenologically described. We finally describe\nprincipal cosmological techniques to measure large-scale properties of dark\nenergy. This chapter complements other articles in this book that describe\ntheoretical understanding (or lack thereof) of the cause for the accelerating\nuniverse.\n", "  Bayesian Model Calibration is used to revisit the problem of scaling factor\ncalibration for semi-empirical correction of ab initio harmonic properties\n(e.g. vibrational frequencies and zero-point energies). A particular attention\nis devoted to the evaluation of scaling factor uncertainty, and to its effect\non the accuracy of scaled properties. We argue that in most cases of interest\nthe standard calibration model is not statistically valid, in the sense that it\nis not able to fit experimental calibration data within their uncertainty\nlimits. This impairs any attempt to use the results of the standard model for\nuncertainty analysis and/or uncertainty propagation. We propose to include a\nstochastic term in the calibration model to account for model inadequacy. This\nnew model is validated in the Bayesian Model Calibration framework. We provide\nexplicit formulae for prediction uncertainty in typical limit cases: large and\nsmall calibration sets of data with negligible measurement uncertainty, and\ndatasets with large measurement uncertainties.\n", "  Malicious mobile phone worms spread between devices via short-range Bluetooth\ncontacts, similar to the propagation of human and other biological viruses.\nRecent work has employed models from epidemiology and complex networks to\nanalyse the spread of malware and the effect of patching specific nodes. These\napproaches have adopted a static view of the mobile networks, i.e., by\naggregating all the edges that appear over time, which leads to an approximate\nrepresentation of the real interactions: instead, these networks are inherently\ndynamic and the edge appearance and disappearance is highly influenced by the\nordering of the human contacts, something which is not captured at all by\nexisting complex network measures. In this paper we first study how the\nblocking of malware propagation through immunisation of key nodes (even if\ncarefully chosen through static or temporal betweenness centrality metrics) is\nineffective: this is due to the richness of alternative paths in these\nnetworks. Then we introduce a time-aware containment strategy that spreads a\npatch message starting from nodes with high temporal closeness centrality and\nshow its effectiveness using three real-world datasets. Temporal closeness\nallows the identification of nodes able to reach most nodes quickly: we show\nthat this scheme can reduce the cellular network resource consumption and\nassociated costs, achieving, at the same time, a complete containment of the\nmalware in a limited amount of time.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) from a quantum chemical\nperspective. Dynamical mean-field theory offers a formalism to extend quantum\nchemical methods for finite systems to infinite periodic problems within a\nlocal correlation approximation. In addition, quantum chemical techniques can\nbe used to construct new ab-initio Hamiltonians and impurity solvers for DMFT.\nHere we explore some ways in which these things may be achieved. First, we\npresent an informal overview of dynamical mean-field theory to connect to\nquantum chemical language. Next we describe an implementation of dynamical\nmean-field theory where we start from an ab-initio Hartree- Fock Hamiltonian\nthat avoids double counting issues present in many applications of DMFT. We\nthen explore the use of the configuration interaction hierarchy in DMFT as an\napproximate solver for the impurity problem. We also investigate some numerical\nissues of convergence within DMFT. Our studies are carried out in the context\nof the cubic hydrogen model, a simple but challenging test for correlation\nmethods. Finally we finish with some conclusions for future directions.\n", "  The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) underpins the solution to many inverse\nproblems commonly possessing missing or un-measured frequency information. This\nincomplete coverage of Fourier space always produces systematic artefacts\ncalled Ghosts. In this paper, a fast and exact method for de-convolving cyclic\nartefacts caused by missing slices of the DFT is presented. The slices\ndiscussed here originate from the exact partitioning of DFT space, under the\nprojective Discrete Radon Transform, called the Discrete Fourier Slice Theorem.\nThe method has a computational complexity of O(n log2 n) (where n = N^2) and is\nconstructed from a new Finite Ghost theory. This theory is also shown to unify\nseveral aspects of work done on Ghosts over the past three decades. The paper\nconcludes with a significant application to fast, exact, non-iterative image\nreconstruction from sets of discrete slices obtained for a limited range of\nprojection angles.\n", "  The Saratoga transfer protocol was developed by Surrey Satellite Technology\nLtd (SSTL) for its Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) satellites. In over\nseven years of operation, Saratoga has provided efficient delivery of\nremote-sensing Earth observation imagery, across private wireless links, from\nthese seven low-orbit satellites to ground stations, using the Internet\nProtocol (IP). Saratoga is designed to cope with high bandwidth-delay products,\nconstrained acknowledgement channels, and high loss while streaming or\ndelivering extremely large files. An implementation of this protocol has now\nbeen developed at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial\nResearch Organisation (CSIRO) for wider use and testing. This is intended to\nprototype delivery of data across dedicated astronomy radio telescope networks\non the ground, where networked sensors in Very Long Baseline Interferometer\n(VLBI) instruments generate large amounts of data for processing and can send\nthat data across private IP- and Ethernet-based links at very high rates. We\ndescribe this new Saratoga implementation, its features and focus on high\nthroughput and link utilization, and lessons learned in developing this\nprotocol for sensor-network applications.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a novel S/D engineering for dual-gated Bilayer\nGraphene (BLG) Field Effect Transistor (FET) using doped semiconductors (with a\nbandgap) as source and drain to obtain unipolar complementary transistors. To\nsimulate the device, a self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF)\nsolver has been developed and validated against published experimental data.\nUsing the simulator, we predict an on-off ratio in excess of $10^4$ and a\nsubthreshold slope of ~110mV/decade with excellent scalability and current\nsaturation, for a 20nm gate length unipolar BLG FET. However, the performance\nof the proposed device is found to be strongly dependent on the S/D series\nresistance effect. The obtained results show significant improvements over\nexisting reports, marking an important step towards bilayer graphene logic\ndevices.\n", "  We model two temperature viscous accretion flows in the sub-Keplerian,\noptically thin, regime around rotating black holes including important\nradiation effects self-consistently. The model successfully explains observed\nluminosities from ultra-luminous to under-luminous sources and predicts the\nspin parameter of black holes.\n", "  The neutrino propagating in curved spacetimes, e.g. around black holes, in\nearly curved universe, violates Lorentz and then CPT symmetry, at least in the\nlocal coordinate. This occurs due to coupling of spin of the neutrino to\nbackground spin connection which modifies the underlying dispersion relation.\nThis results in the neutrino asymmetry and hence as a consequence neutrino\noscillation probability gets affected.\n", "  Rephasing in photon echoes is a fundamental mechanism of retrieving optical\ninformation stored in a collective ensemble of atoms or ions. With an extremely\nweak quantum optical data, population inversion by the rephasing process is\ninevitable resulting in serious quantum noise. Here, an inversion-free\nrephasing method in photon echoes is presented by using deshelving-based atom\nphase control. The present method makes photon echoes directly applicable to\nquantum memories with benefits of extended photon storage time and nearly\nperfect retrieval efficiency. In this revised version only the rephasing pulse\npropagation direction is corrected to make a silent echo of E1 in Fig. 1.\n", "  The paper describes the project, implementation and test of a C-band (5GHz)\nLow Noise Amplifier (LNA) using new low noise Pseudomorphic High Electron\nMobility Transistors (pHEMTS) from Avago. The amplifier was developed to be\nused as a cost effective solution in a receiver chain for Galactic Emission\nMapping (GEM-P) project in Portugal with the objective of finding affordable\nsolutions not requiring strong cryogenic operation, as is the case of massive\nprojects like the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), in Earth Sensing projects and\nother niches like microwave reflectometry. The particular application and\namplifier requirements are first introduced. Several commercially available low\nnoise devices were selected and the noise performance simulated. An ultra-low\nnoise pHEMT was used for an implementation that achieved a Noise Figure of 0.6\ndB with 13 dB gain at 5 GHz. The design, simulation and measured results of the\nprototype are presented and discussed.\n", "  By using exclusively the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and X-ray surface\nbrightness data from 25 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.023< z < 0.784\nwe access cosmic acceleration employing a kinematic description. Such result is\nfully independent on the validity of any metric gravity theory, the possible\nmatter-energy contents filling the Universe, as well as on the SNe Ia Hubble\ndiagram.\n", "  The free parameters of a flat accelerating model without dark energy are\nconstrained by using Supernovae type Ia and observational H(z) data. Instead of\nthe vacuum dominance, the present accelerating stage in this modified\nEinstein-de Sitter cosmology is a consequence of the gravitationally-induced\nparticle production of cold dark matter. The model present a transition from a\ndecelerating to an accelerating regime at low redshifts, and is also able to\nharmonize a cold dark matter picture with the latest measurements of the Hubble\nconstant H_0, the Supernovae observations (Constitution sample), and the H(z)\ndata.\n", "  An expanding spherically symmetric dust cloud is considered in a framework of\ngeneral relativity. Initial conditions leading to a shell-crossing singularity\nare chosen. The way to construct a weak solution for such a case is proposed.\nSuggested method consists in cutting off the region containing the\nshell-crossing and matching the remaining parts of space-time at a thin shell.\nJunction conditions determine the motion of that thin shell. The singular part\nof dust stress-energy tensor is nontrivial only after the shell-crossing\noccurs. Before that the solution coincides with Lemaitre - Tolman - Bondi one.\nA toy model representing an underdensed region in Universe is discussed.\n", "  This paper introduces an amendment to radio interferometric calibration of\nsources below the noise level. The main idea is to employ the information of\nthe stronger sources' measured signals as a plug-in criterion to solve for the\nweaker ones. For this purpose, we construct a number of source clusters, with\ncentroids mainly near the strongest sources, assuming that the signals of the\nsources belonging to a single cluster are corrupted by almost the same errors.\nDue to this characteristic of clusters, each cluster is calibrated as a single\nsource, using all the coherencies of its sources simultaneously. The obtained\nsolutions for every cluster are assigned to all the cluster's sources. An\nillustrative example reveals the superiority of this calibration compared to\nthe un-clustered calibration.\n", "  We propose a classical model Hamiltonian with a ground state presenting a\nspin ice structure. We analyze the introduction of metastable excitations on\nthis ground state, showing the emergence of pairs of magnetic monopoles. The\ninteraction between monopoles and dipoles in the system is studied. As a\nconsequence, we obtain an effective nonlocal interaction between monopoles and\ndipoles from a local classical spin model.\n", "  We investigate the conformal geometry of spherically symmetric spacetimes in\ngeneral without specifying the form of the matter distribution. The general\nconformal Killing symmetry is obtained subject to a number of integrability\nconditions. Previous results relating to static spacetimes are shown to be a\nspecial case of our solution. The general inheriting conformal symmetry vector,\nwhich maps fluid flow lines conformally onto fluid flow lines, is generated and\nthe integrability conditions are shown to be satisfied. We show that there\nexists a hypersurface orthogonal conformal Killing vector in an exact solution\nof Einstein's equations for a relativistic fluid which is expanding,\naccelerating and shearing.\n", "  When the Poincar\\'{e} map associated with a periodic orbit of a hybrid\ndynamical system has constant-rank iterates, we demonstrate the existence of a\nconstant-dimensional invariant subsystem near the orbit which attracts all\nnearby trajectories in finite time. This result shows that the long-term\nbehavior of a hybrid model with a large number of degrees-of-freedom may be\ngoverned by a low-dimensional smooth dynamical system. The appearance of such\nsimplified models enables the translation of analytical tools from smooth\nsystems-such as Floquet theory-to the hybrid setting and provides a bridge\nbetween the efforts of biologists and engineers studying legged locomotion.\n", "  Over the past five years, graphics processing units (GPUs) have had a\ntransformational effect on numerical lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD)\ncalculations in nuclear and particle physics. While GPUs have been applied with\ngreat success to the post-Monte Carlo \"analysis\" phase which accounts for a\nsubstantial fraction of the workload in a typical LQCD calculation, the initial\nMonte Carlo \"gauge field generation\" phase requires capability-level\nsupercomputing, corresponding to O(100) GPUs or more. Such strong scaling has\nnot been previously achieved. In this contribution, we demonstrate that using a\nmulti-dimensional parallelization strategy and a domain-decomposed\npreconditioner allows us to scale into this regime. We present results for two\npopular discretizations of the Dirac operator, Wilson-clover and improved\nstaggered, employing up to 256 GPUs on the Edge cluster at Lawrence Livermore\nNational Laboratory.\n", "  Forty years ago, Wiesner proposed using quantum states to create money that\nis physically impossible to counterfeit, something that cannot be done in the\nclassical world. However, Wiesner's scheme required a central bank to verify\nthe money, and the question of whether there can be unclonable quantum money\nthat anyone can verify has remained open since. One can also ask a related\nquestion, which seems to be new: can quantum states be used as copy-protected\nprograms, which let the user evaluate some function f, but not create more\nprograms for f? This paper tackles both questions using the arsenal of modern\ncomputational complexity. Our main result is that there exist quantum oracles\nrelative to which publicly-verifiable quantum money is possible, and any family\nof functions that cannot be efficiently learned from its input-output behavior\ncan be quantumly copy-protected. This provides the first formal evidence that\nthese tasks are achievable. The technical core of our result is a\n\"Complexity-Theoretic No-Cloning Theorem,\" which generalizes both the standard\nNo-Cloning Theorem and the optimality of Grover search, and might be of\nindependent interest. Our security argument also requires explicit\nconstructions of quantum t-designs. Moving beyond the oracle world, we also\npresent an explicit candidate scheme for publicly-verifiable quantum money,\nbased on random stabilizer states; as well as two explicit schemes for\ncopy-protecting the family of point functions. We do not know how to base the\nsecurity of these schemes on any existing cryptographic assumption. (Note that\nwithout an oracle, we can only hope for security under some computational\nassumption.)\n", "  Radio interferometry is a powerful technique for astronomical imaging. The\ntheory of Compressed Sensing (CS) has been applied recently to the ill-posed\ninverse problem of recovering images from the measurements taken by radio\ninterferometric telescopes. We review novel CS radio interferometric imaging\ntechniques, both at the level of acquisition and reconstruction, and discuss\ntheir superior performance relative to traditional approaches. In order to\nremain as close to the theory of CS as possible, these techniques necessarily\nconsider idealised interferometric configurations. To realise the enhancement\nin quality provided by these novel techniques on real radio interferometric\nobservations, their extension to realistic interferometric configurations is\nnow of considerable importance. We also chart the future direction of research\nrequired to achieve this goal.\n", "  We revisit the asymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetimes in three dimensions.\nUsing the conformal-completion technique, we formulate the boundary conditions\nin a covariant fashion and construct the global charges associated with the\nasymptotic symmetries. The charges so constructed are conserved for the\nasymptotic Killing vectors fields but are not conserved for the asymptotic\nconformal Killing vector fields. The quantity integrated to obtain the global\ncharge is interpreted as the Brown-York boundary stress-energy tensor and it is\nfound not to be traceless. The trace is interpreted as the trace anomaly and it\nturns out to be the same as the Brown-Henneaux central charge.\n", "  A factor-graph representation of quantum-mechanical probabilities is\nproposed. Unlike standard statistical models, the proposed representation uses\nauxiliary variables (state variables) that are not random variables.\n", "  The Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) is located on top of Mauna Kea,\nHawaii, at an altitude of 4.2 km. The existing suite of facility heterodyne\nreceivers covering the submillimeter band is rapidly aging and in need of\nreplacement. To facilitate deep integrations and automated spectral line\nsurveys, a family of remote programmable, synthesized, dual-frequency balanced\nreceivers covering the astronomical important 180 - 720 GHz atmospheric windows\nis in an advanced stage of development. Installation of the first set of\nreceivers is expected in the spring of 2012.\n  Dual-frequency observation will be an important mode of operation offered by\nthe new facility instrumentation. Two band observations are accomplished by\nseparating the H and V polarizations of the incoming signal and routing them\nvia folded optics to the appropriate polarization sensitive balanced mixer.\nScientifically this observation mode facilitates pointing for the higher\nreceiver band under mediocre weather conditions and a doubling of scientific\nthroughput (2 x 4 GHz) under good weather conditions.\n", "  The geometrical structure of a real four-dimensional space-time has been\nextended via the Conservation group with basic field variable being the\northonormal tetrad. Field equations were obtained from a variational principle\nwhich is invariant under the conservation group. Recently, symmetric solutions\nof the field equations have been developed. In this note, the free-field\nsolution is investigated in terms of the value of the scalar curvature. The\nresulting asymptotic value is approximately the negative of the currently\naccepted value of $\\Lambda$, i.e. $R\\approx - 10^{-120}$. This may add further\nsupport to the conclusion that the theory developed by Pandres unifies the\nfields.\n", "  Tidal effects on clumps of material during random non-stationary accretion\nonto a black hole produce phenomena with distinct temporal characteristics in\nobserved light-curves. During such non-stationary accretion events, the shape\nof the accreting object evolves in time, and observable quasi-periodic\nphenomena with variable quasi-periods are produced. A number of characteristic\nlight-curves, obtained with numerical simulations, will be shown. Their\nrelevance to observed phenomena will be briefly discussed.\n", "  We present an exact electrovacuum solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations with\ninfinite sets of multipole moments which can be used to describe the exterior\ngravitational field of a rotating charged mass distribution. We show that in\nthe special case of a slowly rotating and slightly deformed body, the exterior\nsolution can be matched to an interior solution belonging to the Hartle-Thorne\nfamily of approximate solutions. To search for exact interior solutions, we\npropose to use the derivatives of the curvature eigenvalues to formulate a\n$C^3-$matching condition from which the minimum radius can be derived at which\nthe matching of interior and exterior spacetimes can be carried out. We prove\nthe validity of the $C^3-$matching in the particular case of a static mass with\na quadrupole moment. The corresponding interior solution is obtained\nnumerically and the matching with the exterior solution gives as a result the\nminimum radius of the mass configuration.\n", "  How far and how fast does information spread in social media? Researchers\nhave recently examined a number of factors that affect information diffusion in\nonline social networks, including: the novelty of information, users' activity\nlevels, who they pay attention to, and how they respond to friends'\nrecommendations. Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed\nstudy of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the\nTwitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an\nincoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that\n%retweeting behavior is constrained by a few simple principles. the \"principle\nof least effort\" combined with limited attention plays a dominant role in\nretweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information\nwhen it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter stream.\nMoreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided\namong incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected\nindividuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet. Our study\nindicates that the finite ability to process incoming information constrains\nsocial contagion, and we conclude that rapid decay of visibility is the primary\nbarrier to information propagation online.\n", "  The development of practical methods for synthesis and verification of\ncomplex photonic circuits presents a grand challenge for the nascent field of\nquantum engineering. Of course, classical electrical engineering provides\nessential foundations and serves to illustrate the degree of sophistication\nthat can be achieved in automated circuit design. In this paper we explore the\nutility of term rewriting approaches to the transformation of quantum circuit\nmodels, specifically applying rewrite rules for both reduction/verification and\nrobustness analysis of photonic circuits for autonomous quantum error\ncorrection. We outline a workflow for quantum photonic circuit analysis that\nleverages the Modelica framework for multi-domain physical modeling, which\nparallels a previously described approach based on VHSIC Hardware Description\nLanguage (VHDL).\n", "  In this work we present an ultra low energy, 'on-sensor' image processing\narchitecture, based on cellular array of spin based neurons. The 'neuron'\nconstitutes of a lateral spin valve (LSV) with multiple input magnets,\nconnected to an output magnet, using metal channels. The low resistance,\nmagneto-metallic neurons operate at a small terminal voltage of ~20mV, while\nperforming analog computation upon photo sensor inputs. The static current-flow\nacross the device terminals is limited to small periods, corresponding to\nmagnet switching time, and, is determined by a low duty-cycle system-clock.\nThus, the energy-cost of analog-mode processing, inevitable in most image\nsensing applications, is reduced and made comparable to that of dynamic and\nleakage power consumption in peripheral CMOS units. Performance of the proposed\narchitecture for some common image sensing and processing applications like,\nfeature extraction, halftone compression and digitization, have been obtained\nthrough physics based device simulation framework, coupled with SPICE. Results\nindicate that the proposed design scheme can achieve more than two orders of\nmagnitude reduction in computation energy, as compared to the state of art CMOS\ndesigns, that are based on conventional mixed-signal image acquisition and\nprocessing schemes. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first work\nwhere application of nano magnets (in LSV's) in analog signal processing has\nbeen proposed.\n", "  Directional detection is a promising Dark Matter search strategy. Taking\nadvantage on the rotation of the Solar system around the galactic center\nthrough the Dark Matter halo, it allows to show a direction dependence of WIMP\nevents that may be a powerful tool to identify genuine WIMP events as such.\nDirectional detection strategy requires the simultaneous measurement of the\nenergy and the 3D track of low energy recoils, which is a common challenge for\nall current projects of directional detectors.\n", "  This paper discusses a connection between the relativistic number counts of\ncosmological sources and the observed galaxy luminosity function (LF).\nObservational differential number densities are defined and obtained from\npublished LF data using such connection. We observe a distortion in the\nobservational quantities that increases with higher redshift values as compared\nto the theoretical predictions. The use of different cosmological distance\nmeasures plays a role in such a distortion\n", "  The objective of this article is to introduce the tools to analyze the\ncontrast imaging problem in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Optimal trajectories\ncan be selected among extremal solutions of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle\napplied to this Mayer type optimal problem. Such trajectories are associated to\nthe question of extremizing the transfer time. Hence the optimal problem is\nreduced to the analysis of the Hamiltonian dynamics related to singular\nextremals and their optimality status. This is illustrated by using the\nexamples of cerebrospinal fluid / water and grey / white matter of cerebrum.\n", "  The discovery of cosmic rays, a milestone in science, was based on the work\nby scientists in Europe and the New World and took place during a period\ncharacterised by nationalism and lack of communication. Many scientists that\ntook part in this research a century ago were intrigued by the penetrating\nradiation and tried to understand the origin of it. Several important\ncontributions to the discovery of the origin of cosmic rays have been\nforgotten; historical, political and personal facts might have contributed to\ntheir substantial disappearance from the history of science.\n", "  For a generic $f(R)$ which admits a polynomial expansion of at least third\norder (i.e. $\\frac{d^{3}f}{dR^{3}}\\neq 0$) we find the near-throat wormhole\nsolution. Necessary conditions for the existence of wormholes in such $f(R)$\ntheories are derived for both zero and non-zero matter sources. A particular\nchoice of energy-momentum reveals that the wormhole geometry satisfies the weak\nenergy condition (WEC). For a range of parameters even the strong energy\ncondition (SEC) is shown to be satisfied.\n", "  We consider a linear feeder connecting multiple distributed loads and\ngenerators to the sub-station. Voltage is controlled directly at the\nsub-station, however, voltage down the line shifts up or down, in particular\ndepending on if the feeder operates in the power export regime or power import\nregime. Starting from this finite element description of the feeder, assuming\nthat the consumption/generation is distributed heterogeneously along the\nfeeder, and following the asymptotic homogenization approach, we derive simple\nlow-parametric ODE model of the feeder. We also explain how the homogeneous ODE\nmodeling is generalized to account for other distributed effects, e.g. for\ninverter based and voltage dependent control of reactive power. The resulting\nsystem of the DistFlow-ODEs, relating homogenized voltage to flows of real and\nreactive power along the lines, admits computationally efficient analysis in\nterms of the minimal number of the feeder line \"media\" parameters, such as the\nratio of the inductance-to-resistance densities. Exploring the space of the\nmedia and control parameters allows us to test and juxtapose different measures\nof the system performance, in particular expressed in terms of the voltage drop\nalong the feeder, power import/export from the feeder line as the whole, power\nlosses within the feeder, and critical (with respect to possible voltage\ncollapse) length of the feeder. Our most surprising funding relates to\nperformance of a feeder rich on PhotoVoltaic (PV) systems during a sunny day.\nWe observe that if the feeder is sufficiently long the DistFlow-ODEs may have\nmultiple stable solutions. The multiplicity may mean troubles for successful\nrecovery of the feeder after a very short, few periods long, fault at the head\nof the line.\n", "  Pulsars in close binary systems have provided some of the most stringent\ntests of strong-field gravity to date. The pulsar--white-dwarf binary system\nJ1141-6545 is specifically interesting due to its gravitational asymmetry which\nmakes it one of the most powerful probes of tensor-scalar theories of gravity.\nWe give an overview of current gravitational tests provided by the J1141-6545\nbinary system and comment on how anomalous accelerations, geodetic precession\nand timing instabilities may be prevented from limiting future tests of gravity\nto come from this system.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the risks of friends in social networks caused by\ntheir friendship patterns, by using real life social network data and starting\nfrom a previously defined risk model. Particularly, we observe that risks of\nfriendships can be mined by analyzing users' attitude towards friends of\nfriends. This allows us to give new insights into friendship and risk dynamics\non social networks.\n", "  Scintillating ceramics are a promising, new development for various\napplications in science and industry. Their application in calorimetry for\nparticle physics experiments is expected to involve an exposure to high levels\nof ionizing radiation. In this paper, changes in performance have been measured\nfor scintillating ceramic samples of different composition after exposure to\npenetrating ionizing radiation up to a dose of 38 kGy.\n", "  PoGOLite is a hard X-ray polarimeter operating in the 25-100 keV energy band.\nThe instrument design is optimised for the observation of compact astrophysical\nsources. Observations are conducted from a stabilised stratospheric balloon\nplatform at an altitude of approximately 40 km. The primary targets for first\nballoon flights of a reduced effective area instrument are the Crab and\nCygnus-X1. The polarisation of incoming photons is determined using coincident\nCompton scattering and photo-absorption events reconstructed in an array of\nplastic scintillator detector cells surrounded by a bismuth germanate oxide\n(BGO) side anticoincidence shield and a polyethylene neutron shield. A custom\nattitude control system keeps the polarimeter field-of-view aligned to targets\nof interest, compensating for sidereal motion and perturbations such as\ntorsional forces in the balloon rigging. An overview of the PoGOLite project is\npresented and the outcome of the ill-fated maiden balloon flight is discussed.\n", "  This paper applies recent results on the robust stability of nonlinear\nquantum systems to the case of a Josephson junction in a resonant cavity. The\nJosephson junction is characterized by a Hamiltonian operator which contains a\nnon-quadratic term involving a cosine function. This leads to a sector bounded\nnonlinearity which enables the previously developed theory to be applied to\nthis system in order to analyze its stability.\n", "  We describe the main components of the ATLAS Forward Physics project, namely\nthe movable beam pipe, the tracking and timing detectors which allow to detect\nintact protons in the final state at the LHC. The position detector is composed\non 6 layers of 3D silicon detectors readout by FE-I4 chips developped for\nATLAS. The fast timing detector is built from a quartz-based Cerenkov detector\ncoupled to a microchannel plate photomultiplier tube, followed by the\nelectronic elements that amplify, measure, and record the time of the event\nalong with a stabilized reference clock signal, ensuring a time resolution of\n10-15 picoseconds.\n", "  In order to cope with the increased data volumes generated by modern radio\ninterferometers such as LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) or SKA (Square Kilometre\nArray), fast and efficient calibration algorithms are essential. Traditional\nradio interferometric calibration is performed using nonlinear optimization\ntechniques such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in Euclidean space. In\nthis paper, we reformulate radio interferometric calibration as a nonlinear\noptimization problem on a Riemannian manifold. The reformulated calibration\nproblem is solved using the Riemannian trust-region method. We show that\ncalibration on a Riemannian manifold has faster convergence with reduced\ncomputational cost compared to conventional calibration in Euclidean space.\n", "  The quantum capacity of degradable quantum channels has been proven to be\nadditive. On the other hand, there is no general rule for the behavior of\nquantum capacity for non-degradable quantum channels. We introduce the set of\npartially degradable (PD) quantum channels to answer the question of additivity\nof quantum capacity for a well-separable subset of non-degradable channels. A\nquantum channel is partially degradable if the channel output can be used to\nsimulate the degraded environment state. PD channels could exist both in the\ndegradable, non-degradable and conjugate degradable family. We define the term\npartial simulation, which is a clear benefit that arises from the structure of\nthe complementary channel of a PD channel. We prove that the quantum capacity\nof an arbitrary dimensional PD channel is additive. We also demonstrate that\nbetter quantum data rates can be achieved over a PD channel in comparison to\nstandard (non-PD) channels. Our results indicate that the partial degradability\nproperty can be exploited and yet still hold many benefits for quantum\ncommunications.\n", "  Predicting the future direction of community evolution is a problem with high\ntheoretical and practical significance. It allows to determine which\ncharacteristics describing communities have importance from the point of view\nof their future behaviour. Knowledge about the probable future career of the\ncommunity aids in the decision concerning investing in contact with members of\na given community and carrying out actions to achieve a key position in it. It\nalso allows to determine effective ways of forming opinions or to protect group\nparticipants against such activities. In the paper, a new approach to group\nidentification and prediction of future events is presented together with the\ncomparison to existing method. Performed experiments prove a high quality of\nprediction results. Comparison to previous studies shows that using many\nmeasures to describe the group profile, and in consequence as a classifier\ninput, can improve predictions.\n", "  LWA1 is a new large radio telescope array operating in the frequency range\n10-88 MHz, located in central New Mexico. The telescope consists of 260 pairs\nof dipole-type antennas whose outputs are individually digitized and formed\ninto beams. Simultaneously, signals from all dipoles can be recorded using one\nof the telescope's \"all dipoles\" modes, facilitating all-sky imaging. Notable\nfeatures of the instrument include four independently-steerable beams utilizing\ndigital \"true time delay\" beamforming, high intrinsic sensitivity (about 6 kJy\nzenith system equivalent flux density), large instantaneous bandwidth (up to 78\nMHz), and large field of view (about 3-10 degrees, depending on frequency and\nzenith angle of pointing). This paper summarizes the design of LWA1, its\nperformance as determined in commissioning experiments, and results from early\nscience observations demonstrating the capabilities of the instrument.\n", "  Strongly correlated Kondo insulator SmB6 is known for its peculiar low\ntemperature residual conduction, which has recently been demonstrated to arise\nfrom a robust metallic surface state, as predicted by the theory of topological\nKondo insulator (TKI). Photoemission, quantum oscillation and magnetic doping\nexperiments have provided evidence for the Dirac-like dispersion and\ntopological protection. Questions arise as whether signatures of spin-momentum\nlocking and electron interaction could be resolved in transport measurements.\nHere we report metallic conduction of surface state down to mK temperatures\nwith saturation behaviors suggestive of Kondo effect. We observe in the surface\nstate the weak-antilocalization (WAL) effect that is in agreement with a\nspin-momentum locked metallic surface. At larger perpendicular magnetic fields,\nthe surface state exhibits an unusual linear magnetoresistance similar to those\nfound in Bi-based topological insulators and in graphene. (Correspondence to:\nxia.jing@uci.edu)\n", "  Cooperative behaviors arising from bacterial cell-to-cell communication can\nbe modeled by reaction-diffusion equations having only a single diffusible\ncomponent. This paper presents the following three contributions for the\nsystematic analysis of Turing instability in such reaction-diffusion systems.\n(i) We first introduce a unified framework to formulate the reaction-diffusion\nsystem as an interconnected multi-agent dynamical system. (ii) Then, we\nmathematically classify biologically plausible and implausible Turing\ninstabilities and characterize them by the root locus of each agent's dynamics,\nor the local reaction dynamics. (iii) Using this characterization, we derive\nanalytic conditions for biologically plausible Turing instability, which\nprovide useful guidance for the design and the analysis of biological networks.\nThese results are demonstrated on an extended Gray-Scott model with a single\ndiffuser.\n", "  We show that Weyl-invariant dilaton gravity provides a description of black\nholes without classical spacetime singularities. Singularities appear due to\nill-behaviour of gauge fixing conditions, one example being the gauge in which\ntheory is classically equivalent to standard General Relativity. The main\nconclusions of our analysis are: (1) singularities signal a phase transition\nfrom broken to unbroken phase of Weyl symmetry, (2) instead of a singularity\nthere is a \"baby-universe\" or a white hole inside a black hole, (3) in the baby\nuniverse scenario there is a critical mass after which reducing mass makes\nblack hole larger as viewed by outside observers, (4) if a black hole could be\nconnected with white hole through the \"singularity\", this would require\nbreakdown of (classical) geometric description, (5) the singularity of\nSchwarzschild BH solution is non-generic and so it is dangerous to rely on it\nin deriving general results. Our results may have important consequences for\nresolving issues related to information-loss puzzle. The theory we use is\nbasically a completion of General Relativity, containing neither additional\nphysical excitations nor higher-derivative terms, but requires physical scalar\nfield such as Higgs field of Standard Model. Though quantum effects are still\ncrucial and may change the proposed classical picture, a position of building\nquantum theory around essentially regular classical solutions normally provides\na much better starting point.\n", "  In this article we review the basic theoretical properties of a hybrid\nsuperconducting interferometer which exploits the phase dependence of the\ndensity of states of a metallic nanowire placed in good electric contact with a\nsuperconductor to achieve high sensitivity to magnetic flux. The operation of a\nprototype structure based on this principle, the superconducting quantum\ninterference proximity transistor (SQUIPT), has been recently reported. Limited\npower dissipation joined with the opportunity to access single-spin detection\nmake this interferometer attractive for the investigation of the switching\ndynamics of individual magnetic nanoparticles. The noise behavior of the device\nis presented as well, where the feasibility of this structure as a single-spin\ndetector is also briefly addressed. In the final part we present the response\nof a real SQUIPT device.\n", "  We perform a joint numerical and experimental study to sistematically\ncharacterize the motion of drops sliding over a periodic array of alternating\nhydrophobic and hydrophilic stripes with large wettability contrast, and\ntypical width of hundreds of $\\mu \\textrm{m}$. The fraction of the hydrophobic\nstripes has been varied from about 20% to 80%. The effects of the heterogeneous\npatterning can be described by a renormalized value of the critical Bond\nnumber, i.e. the critical dimensionless force needed to depin the drop before\nit starts to move. Close to the critical Bond number we observe a jerkily\nmotion characterized by an evident stick-slip dynamics. As a result,\ndissipation is strongly localized in time, and the mean velocity of the drops\ncan easily decrease by an order of magnitude compared to the sliding on\nhomogeneous surface. Lattice Boltzmann (LB) numerical simulations are crucial\nfor disclosing to what extent the sliding dynamics can be deduced from the\ncomputed balance of capillary, viscous and body forces at varying the Bond\nnumber, the surface composition and the liquid viscosity. Away from the\ncritical Bond number, we characterize both experimentally and numerically the\ndissipation inside the droplet by studying the relation between the average\nvelocity and the applied volume forces.\n", "  Matter falling onto a black hole is trans-relativistic, transonic, and close\nto the horizon it is sub-Keplerian. Such a flow shows the existence of multiple\ncritical point, shocks etc. Employing relativistic equation of state and\nrealistic composition, it has been shown that the solution strongly depend on\nthe composition of the fluid. Electron-positron fluid is the least\nrelativistic, to the extent that multiple critical points, shocks etc do not\nform. The most relativistic fluid is the one whose ratio of proton to electron\nnumber density is ~ 0.2. Since the solution strongly depend on composition, the\nemitted radiation should strongly depend on the composition too.\n", "  We prove an Eyring-Kramers law for the small eigenvalues and mean\nfirst-passage times of a metastable Markovian jump process which is invariant\nunder a group of symmetries. Our results show that the usual Eyring-Kramers law\nfor asymmetric processes has to be corrected by a factor computable in terms of\nstabilisers of group orbits. Furthermore, the symmetry can produce additional\nArrhenius exponents and modify the spectral gap. The results are based on\nrepresentation theory of finite groups.\n", "  Just as there are frictional losses associated with moving masses on a\nsurface, what if there were frictional losses associated with moving\ninformation on a substrate? Indeed, many modes of communication suffer from\nsuch frictional losses. We propose to model these losses as proportional to\n\"bit-meters,\" i.e., the product of mass of information (i.e., the number of\nbits) and the distance of information transport. We use this \"information-\nfriction\" model to understand fundamental energy requirements on encoding and\ndecoding in communication circuitry. First, for communication across a binary\ninput AWGN channel, we arrive at fundamental limits on bit-meters (and thus\nenergy consumption) for decoding implementations that have a predetermined\ninput-independent length of messages. For encoding, we relax the fixed-length\nassumption and derive bounds for flexible-message- length implementations.\nUsing these lower bounds we show that the total (transmit + encoding +\ndecoding) energy-per-bit must diverge to infinity as the target error\nprobability is lowered to zero. Further, the closer the communication rate is\nmaintained to the channel capacity (as the target error-probability is lowered\nto zero), the faster the required decoding energy diverges to infinity.\n", "  Community detection algorithms are fundamental tools that allow us to uncover\norganizational principles in networks. When detecting communities, there are\ntwo possible sources of information one can use: the network structure, and the\nfeatures and attributes of nodes. Even though communities form around nodes\nthat have common edges and common attributes, typically, algorithms have only\nfocused on one of these two data modalities: community detection algorithms\ntraditionally focus only on the network structure, while clustering algorithms\nmostly consider only node attributes. In this paper, we develop Communities\nfrom Edge Structure and Node Attributes (CESNA), an accurate and scalable\nalgorithm for detecting overlapping communities in networks with node\nattributes. CESNA statistically models the interaction between the network\nstructure and the node attributes, which leads to more accurate community\ndetection as well as improved robustness in the presence of noise in the\nnetwork structure. CESNA has a linear runtime in the network size and is able\nto process networks an order of magnitude larger than comparable approaches.\nLast, CESNA also helps with the interpretation of detected communities by\nfinding relevant node attributes for each community.\n", "  We present a set of independent formulae to extract the gluon distribution\nand singlet structure function from its derivatives with respect to $lnQ^{2}$\nin the next- to- leading order of perturbation theory at low-$x$ based on a\nhard pomeron exchange. In this approach, both singlet quarks and gluons have\nthe same high-energy behavior at small $x$. This approach needs the QCD input\nparameterizations for a independent DGLAP evolutions that we calculated\nnumerically and compared with MRST, GRV and DL model- the Pomeron has a hard\nnature. Its evolution gives a good fit to the experimental data. The obtained\nvalues are in the range\n$10^{-4}\\hspace{0.1cm}{\\leq}\\hspace{0.1cm}x\\hspace{0.1cm}{\\leq}10^{-2}$ at\n$Q^{2}=20 \\hspace{0.1cm}GeV^{2}$.\n", "  We show that the nonlinear corrections to the longitudinal structure function\ncan be tamed the singularity behavior at low x values, with respect to GLR-MQ\nequations. This approach can determined the shadowing longitudinal structure\nfunction based on the shadowing corrections to the gluon and singlet quark\nstructure functions. Comparing our results with HERA data show that at very low\nx this behavior completely tamed by these corrections.\n", "  High luminosity conditions at the LHC pose many unique challenges for\npotential silicon based track trigger systems. One of the major challenges is\ndata formatting, where hits from thousands of silicon modules must first be\nshared and organized into overlapping eta-phi trigger towers. Communication\nbetween nodes requires high bandwidth, low latency, and flexible real time data\nsharing, for which a full mesh backplane is a natural solution. A custom\nAdvanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture data processing board is\ndesigned with the goal of creating a scalable architecture abundant in\nflexible, non-blocking, high bandwidth board to board communication channels\nwhile keeping the design as simple as possible. We have performed the first\nprototype board testing and our first attempt at designing the prototype system\nhas proven to be successful. Leveraging the experience we gained through\ndesigning, building and testing the prototype board system we are in the final\nstages of laying out the next generation board, which will be used in the ATLAS\nLevel-2 Fast TracKer as Data Formatter, as well as in the CMS Level-1 tracking\ntrigger R&D for early technical demonstrations.\n", "  In this paper, we propose and study a master-equation based approach to drive\na quantum network with $n$ qubits to a consensus (symmetric) state introduced\nby Mazzarella et al. The state evolution of the quantum network is described by\na Lindblad master equation with the Lindblad terms generated by continuous-time\nswapping operators, which also introduce an underlying interaction graph. We\nestablish a graphical method that bridges the proposed quantum consensus scheme\nand classical consensus dynamics by studying an induced graph (with $2^{2n}$\nnodes) of the quantum interaction graph (with $n$ qubits). A fundamental\nconnection is then shown that quantum consensus over the quantum graph is\nequivalent to componentwise classical consensus over the induced graph, which\nallows various existing works on classical consensus to be applicable to the\nquantum setting. Some basic scaling and structural properties of the quantum\ninduced graph are established via combinatorial analysis. Necessary and\nsufficient conditions for exponential and asymptotic quantum consensus are\nobtained, respectively, for switching quantum interaction graphs. As a quantum\nanalogue of classical synchronization of coupled oscillators, quantum\nsynchronization conditions are also presented, in which the reduced states of\nall qubits tend to a common trajectory.\n", "  We present the generation and characterization of the class of bracket\nstates, namely phase-sensitive mixtures of coherent states exhibiting symmetry\nproperties in the phase-space description. A bracket state can be seen as the\nstatistical ensemble arriving at a receiver in a typical coherent-state-based\ncommunication channel. We show that when a bracket state is mixed at a beam\nsplitter with a local oscillator, both the emerging beams exhibit a Fano factor\nlarger than 1 and dependent on the relative phase between the input state and\nthe local oscillator. We discuss the possibility to exploit this dependence to\nmonitor the phase difference for the enhancement of the performances of a\nsimple communication scheme based on direct detection. Our experimental setup\ninvolves linear optical elements and a pair of photon-number-resolving\ndetectors operated in the mesoscopic photon-number domain.\n", "  It was found in [Europhysics Letters {\\bf 104}, (2013), 60003] that classical\nTsallis theory exhibits poles in the partition function ${\\cal Z}$ and the mean\nenergy $<{\\cal U}>$. These occur at a countably set of the q-line. We give\nhere, via a simple procedure, a mathematical account of them. Further, by\nfocusing attention upon the pole-physics, we encounter interesting effects. In\nparticular, for the specific heat, we uncover hidden gravitational effects.\n", "  First, we derive an explicit formula for the Poisson bracket of the classical\nfinite W-algebra W^{fin}(g,f), the algebra of polynomial functions on the\nSlodowy slice associated to a simple Lie algebra g and its nilpotent element f.\nOn the other hand, we produce an explicit set of generators and we derive an\nexplicit formula for the Poisson vertex algebra structure of the classical\naffine W-algebra W(g,f). As an immediate consequence, we obtain a Poisson\nalgebra isomorphism between W^{fin}(g,f) and the Zhu algebra of W(g,f). We also\nstudy the generalized Miura map for classical W-algebras.\n", "  We report an implementation of self-consistent Green's function many-body\ntheory within a second-order approximation (GF2) for application with molecular\nsystems. This is done by iterative solution of the Dyson equation expressed in\nmatrix form in an atomic orbital basis, where the Green's function and\nself-energy are built on the imaginary frequency and imaginary time domain\nrespectively, and fast Fourier transform is used to efficiently transform these\nquantities as needed. We apply this method to several archetypical examples of\nstrong correlation, such as a H$_{32}$ finite lattice that displays a highly\nmultireference electronic ground state even at equilibrium lattice spacing. In\nall cases GF2 gives a physically meaningful description of the metal to\ninsulator transition in these systems, without resorting to spin-symmetry\nbreaking. Our results show that self-consistent Green's function many-body\ntheory offers a viable route to describing strong correlations while remaining\nwithin a computationally tractable single-particle formalism.\n", "  In recent works, compressed sensing (CS) and convex optimization techniques\nhave been applied to radio-interferometric imaging showing the potential to\noutperform state-of-the-art imaging algorithms in the field. We review our\nlatest contributions, which leverage the versatility of convex optimization to\nboth handle realistic continuous visibilities and offer a highly parallelizable\nstructure paving the way to significant acceleration of the reconstruction and\nhigh-dimensional data scalability. The new algorithmic structure promoted in a\nnew software PURIFY (beta version) relies on the simultaneous-direction method\nof multipliers (SDMM). The performance of various sparsity priors is evaluated\nthrough simulations in the continuous visibility setting, confirming the\nsuperiority of our recent average sparsity approach SARA.\n", "  The deformation and break-up of Newtonian/viscoelastic droplets are studied\nin confined shear flow. Our numerical approach is based on a combination of\nLattice-Boltzmann models (LBM) and finite difference schemes, the former used\nto model two immiscible fluids with variable viscous ratio, and the latter used\nto model the polymer dynamics. The kinetics of the polymers is introduced using\nconstitutive equations for viscoelastic fluids with finitely extensible\nnon-linear elastic dumbbells with Peterlin's closure (FENE-P). We quantify the\ndroplet response by changing the polymer relaxation time $\\tau_P$, the maximum\nextensibility $L$ of the polymers, and the degree of confinement, i.e. the\nratio of the droplet diameter to gap spacing. In unconfined shear flow, the\neffects of droplet viscoelasticity on the critical Capillary number\n$\\mbox{Ca}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{cr}}}$ for break-up are moderate in all cases studied.\nHowever, in confined conditions a different behaviour is observed: the critical\nCapillary number of a viscoelastic droplet increases or decreases, depending on\nthe maximum elongation of the polymers, the latter affecting the extensional\nviscosity of the polymeric solution. Force balance is monitored in the\nnumerical simulations to validate the physical picture.\n", "  We consider a gas of point particles moving in a one-dimensional channel with\na hard-core inter-particle interaction that prevents particle crossings ---\nthis is called single-file motion. Starting from equilibrium initial conditions\nwe observe the motion of a tagged particle. It is well known that if the\nindividual particle dynamics is diffusive, then the tagged particle motion is\nsub-diffusive, while for ballistic particle dynamics, the tagged particle\nmotion is diffusive. Here we compute exactly the large deviation function for\nthe tagged particle displacement and show that this is universal, independent\nof the individual dynamics.\n", "  The Kennedy-like receiver is a quasi-optimal receiver employed in binary\nphase-shift-keyed communication schemes with coherent states. It is based on\nthe interference of the two signals encoding the message with a reference local\noscillator and on/off photodetection. We show both theoretically and\nexperimentally that it is possible to extract useful information about the\nphase reference by Bayesian processing of the very same data sample used to\ndiscriminate the signals shot by shot. We demonstrate that the minimum\nuncertainty in phase estimation, given by the inverse of the Fisher information\nassociated with the statistics of the collected data, can be achieved. We also\nnumerically and experimentally investigate the performances of our\nphase-estimation method in the presence of phase noise, when either on/off or\nphoton-number resolving detectors are employed.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum\nobserver for a closed linear quantum system. The proposed observer is shown to\nbe able to estimate some but not all of the plant variables in a time averaged\nsense. A simple example and simulations are included to illustrate the\nproperties of the observer.\n", "  We have observed the occurrence of dendritic flux avalanches in an amorphous\nfilm of Mo$_{84}$Si$_{16}$. These events are understood to have a\nthermomagnetic origin and involve the abrupt penetration of bursts of magnetic\nflux taking place within a limited window of temperatures and magnetic fields.\nWhile dc-magnetometry allows one to determine the threshold fields for the\noccurrence of the thermomagnetic instabilities, magneto-optical imaging reveals\nthe spatial distribution of magnetic flux throughout the sample. Conducting\nappropriate experiments, typical for this goal, avalanches were confirmed to be\na characteristic of this material, ruling out the otherwise admissible\npossibility of an experimental artifact or a feature related to defects in the\nfilm. After the present observation, a-MoSi can be included in the gallery of\nsuperconducting materials exhibiting flux avalanches when in the form of thin\nfilms, a characteristic that must be carefully taken into consideration when\none plans to employ films of those materials in applications.\n", "  Embedding calculations that find approximate solutions to the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for large molecules and realistic solids are performed commonly in a\nthree step procedure involving (i) construction of a model system with\neffective interactions approximating the low energy physics of the initial\nrealistic system, (ii) mapping the model system onto an impurity Hamiltonian,\nand (iii) solving the impurity problem. We have developed a novel procedure for\nparametrizing the impurity Hamiltonian that avoids the mathematically\nuncontrolled step of constructing the low energy model system. Instead, the\nimpurity Hamiltonian is immediately parametrized to recover the self-energy of\nthe realistic system in the limit of high frequencies or short time. The\neffective interactions parametrizing the fictitious impurity Hamiltonian are\nlocal to the embedded regions, and include all the non-local interactions\npresent in the original realistic Hamiltonian in an implicit way. We show that\nthis impurity Hamiltonian can lead to excellent total energies and\nself-energies that approximate the quantities of the initial realistic system\nvery well. Moreover, we show that as long as the effective impurity Hamiltonian\nparametrization is designed to recover the self-energy of the initial realistic\nsystem for high frequencies, we can expect a good total energy and self-energy.\nFinally, we propose two practical ways of evaluating effective integrals for\nparametrizing impurity models.\n", "  Random intersection graphs have received much attention for nearly two\ndecades, and currently have a wide range of applications ranging from key\npredistribution in wireless sensor networks to modeling social networks. In\nthis paper, we investigate the strengths of connectivity and robustness in a\ngeneral random intersection graph model. Specifically, we establish sharp\nasymptotic zero-one laws for $k$-connectivity and $k$-robustness, as well as\nthe asymptotically exact probability of $k$-connectivity, for any positive\ninteger $k$. The $k$-connectivity property quantifies how resilient is the\nconnectivity of a graph against node or edge failures. On the other hand,\n$k$-robustness measures the effectiveness of local diffusion strategies (that\ndo not use global graph topology information) in spreading information over the\ngraph in the presence of misbehaving nodes. In addition to presenting the\nresults under the general random intersection graph model, we consider two\nspecial cases of the general model, a binomial random intersection graph and a\nuniform random intersection graph, which both have numerous applications as\nwell. For these two specialized graphs, our results on asymptotically exact\nprobabilities of $k$-connectivity and asymptotic zero-one laws for\n$k$-robustness are also novel in the literature.\n", "  Stemming from the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld surface integral, the addition theorems\nfor the spherical wave and Legendre functions, and a weighing function\ndescribing the behavior of the radial component of the normal velocity at the\nsurface of a finite circular radiating source, partial-wave series expansions\nare derived for the incident field of acoustic spiraling (vortex) beams in a\nspherical coordinate system centered on the axis of wave propagation. Examples\nfor vortex beams, comprising \\rho-vortex, zeroth-order and higher-order\nBessel-Gauss and Bessel, truncated Neumann-Gauss and Hankel-Gauss,\nLaguerre-Gauss, and other Gaussian-type vortex beams are considered. The\nmathematical expressions are exact solutions of the Helmholtz equation. The\nresults presented here are particularly useful to accurately evaluate\nanalytically and compute numerically the acoustic scattering and other\nmechanical effects of finite vortex beams, such as the axial and 3D acoustic\nradiation force and torque components on a sphere of any (isotropic,\nanisotropic etc.) material (fluid, elastic, viscoelastic etc.). Numerical\npredictions allow optimal design of parameters in applications including but\nnot limited to acoustical tweezers, acousto-fluidics, beam-forming design and\nimaging to name a few.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of the quantum Rabi model for two qubits interacting\nthrough a common bosonic field mode (resonator), focusing on the generation and\ndetection of maximally entangled Bell states. We obtain analytical results for\nthe unitary dynamics of this system in the slow-qubit (or degenerate) regime,\nconsidering ultra-strong coupling between qubits and resonator mode, for which\nthe rotating wave approximation is no longer applicable. We also numerically\ninvestigate the dynamics beyond the slow-qubit condition in order to study the\nvalidity of the model in the presence of less strict conditions.\n", "  We present a study of single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (smRTI) with\na modified Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (mDSMC) code in two dimensions. The\nmDSMC code is aimed to capture the dynamics of matter for a large range of\nKnudsen numbers within one approach. Our method combines the traditional Monte\nCarlo technique to efficiently propagate particles and the\nPoint-of-Closest-Approach method for high spatial resolution. Simulations are\nperformed using different particle mean-free-paths and we compare the results\nto linear theory predictions for the growth rate including diffusion and\nviscosity. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and\nsimulations and, at late times, observe the development of secondary\ninstabilities, similar to hydrodynamic simulations and experiments. Large\nmean-free-paths favor particle diffusion, reduce the occurrence of secondary\ninstabilities and approach the non-interacting gas limit.\n", "  The Kerr-Newman metric describes a very special rotating, charged mass and is\nthe most general of the asymptotically flat stationary 'black hole' solutions\nto the Einstein-Maxwell equations of general relativity. We review the\nderivation of this metric from the Reissner-Nordstrom solution by means of a\ncomplex transformation algorithm and provide a brief overview of its basic\ngeometric properties. We also include some discussion of interpretive issues,\nrelated metrics, and higher-dimensional analogues.\n", "  An inertial mass measurement project, which is expected to precisely measure\nthe Planck constant, $h$, for possible comparisons with known gravitational\nmass measurement projects, e.g., the watt balance and the Avogadro project, is\nbeing carried out at the National Institute of Metrology, China. The principle,\napparatus, and experimental investigations of the inertial mass measurement are\npresented. The prototype of the experiment and the Planck constant with\nrelative uncertainty of several parts in $10^{4}$ have been achieved for\nprinciple testing.\n", "  We investigate the break-up of Newtonian/viscoelastic droplets in a\nviscoelastic/Newtonian matrix under the hydrodynamic conditions of a confined\nshear flow. Our numerical approach is based on a combination of\nLattice-Boltzmann models (LBM) and Finite Difference (FD) schemes. LBM are used\nto model two immiscible fluids with variable viscosity ratio (i.e. the ratio of\nthe droplet to matrix viscosity); FD schemes are used to model viscoelasticity,\nand the kinetics of the polymers is introduced using constitutive equations for\nviscoelastic fluids with finitely extensible non-linear elastic dumbbells with\nPeterlin's closure (FENE-P). We study both strongly and weakly confined cases\nto highlight the role of matrix and droplet viscoelasticity in changing the\ndroplet dynamics after the startup of a shear flow. Simulations provide easy\naccess to quantities such as droplet deformation and orientation and will be\nused to quantitatively predict the critical Capillary number at which the\ndroplet breaks, the latter being strongly correlated to the formation of\nmultiple neckings at break-up. This study complements our previous\ninvestigation on the role of droplet viscoelasticity (A. Gupta \\& M.\nSbragaglia, {\\it Phys. Rev. E} {\\bf 90}, 023305 (2014)), and is here further\nextended to the case of matrix viscoelasticity.\n", "  The theory of natural selection has two forms. Deductive theory describes how\npopulations change over time. One starts with an initial population and some\nrules for change. From those assumptions, one calculates the future state of\nthe population. Deductive theory predicts how populations adapt to\nenvironmental challenge. Inductive theory describes the causes of change in\npopulations. One starts with a given amount of change. One then assigns\ndifferent parts of the total change to particular causes. Inductive theory\nanalyzes alternative causal models for how populations have adapted to\nenvironmental challenge. This chapter emphasizes the inductive analysis of\ncause.\n", "  Here we present practical methods for simulation and reconstruction of\nin-line digital holograms recorded with plane and spherical waves. The\nalgorithms described here are applicable to holographic imaging of an object\nexhibiting absorption as well as phase shifting properties. Optimal parameters,\nrelated to distances, sampling rate, and other factors for successful\nsimulation and reconstruction of holograms are evaluated and criteria for the\nachievable resolution are worked out. Moreover, we show that the numerical\nprocedures for the reconstruction of holograms recorded with plane and\nspherical waves are identical under certain conditions. Experimental examples\nof holograms and their reconstructions are also discussed.\n", "  In order to compute the Schmidt decomposition of $A\\in M_k\\otimes M_m$, we\nmust consider an associated self-adjoint map. Here, we show that if $A$ is\npositive under partial transposition (PPT) or symmetric with positive\ncoefficients (SPC) or invariant under realignment then its associated\nself-adjoint map is completely reducible. We give applications of this fact in\nQuantum Information Theory. We recover some theorems recently proved for PPT\nand SPC matrices and we prove these theorems for matrices invariant under\nrealignment using theorems of Perron-Frobenius theory. We also provide a new\nproof of the fact that if $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$ contains $k$ mutually unbiased bases\nthen $\\mathbb{C}^{k}$ contains $k+1$. We search for other types of matrices\nthat could have the same property. We consider a group of linear\ntransformations acting on $M_k\\otimes M_k$, which contains the partial\ntranspositions and the realignment map. For each element of this group, we\nconsider the set of matrices in $M_k\\otimes M_k\\simeq M_{k^2}$ that are\npositive and remain positive, or invariant, under the action of this element.\nWithin this family of sets, we have the set of PPT matrices, the set of SPC\nmatrices and the set of matrices invariant under realignment. We show that\nthese three sets are the only sets of this family such that the associated\nself-adjoint map of each matrix is completely reducible. We also show that\nevery matrix invariant under realignment is PPT in $M_2\\otimes M_2$ and we\npresent a counterexample in $M_k\\otimes M_k$, $k\\geq 3$.\n", "  A new watt balance is being constructed at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) in preparation for the redefinition of the\nInternational System of Units and the realization of mass through an exact\nvalue of the Planck constant. The total relative uncertainty goal for this\ninstrument of a few parts in $10^{8}$ requires that the local acceleration due\nto gravity be known at the location of a test mass with a relative uncertainty\non the order of only a few parts in $10^{9}$. To make this determination, both\nthe horizontal and vertical gradients of gravity must be known such that\ngravity may be tied from an absolute reference in the laboratory to the precise\nmass location. We describe the procedures used to model and measure gravity\nvariations throughout the laboratory and give our results.\n", "  The majority of discovered exoplanetary systems harbour a new class of\nplanets, bodies typically several times more massive than Earth but orbiting\ntheir host stars well inside the orbit of Mercury. The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN. In both cases, final assembly of the planets occurs by giant impacts\n(GIs). Here we test the viability of these scenarios. We show that atmospheres\naccreted by isolation masses are small ($10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ the core mass) and\nthat atmospheric mass-loss during GIs is significant, with typical post-GI\natmospheres that are $8 \\times 10^{-4}$ the core mass. Such values are\nconsistent with terrestrial planet atmospheres but more than an order of\nmagnitude below atmospheric masses of $1-10\\%$ inferred for many close-in\nexoplanets. In the most optimistic scenario with no core luminosity, post-GI\nenvelope accretion from a depleted gas disc yields atmospheric masses that are\nseveral per cent the core mass. If the gravitational potential energy due to\nthe last mass doubling of the planet by GIs is released over the disc\ndissipation time-scale as core luminosity, then envelope masses are reduced by\nabout an order of magnitude. Finally we show that radial drift time-scales due\nto gas drag for many isolation masses are shorter than typical disc lifetimes.\nGiven these challenges, we conclude that most observed close-in planets with\nenvelopes larger than several per cent likely formed at larger separations from\ntheir host stars.\n", "  The primary objective is to enhance muon-tomographic image reconstruction\ncapability by providing distinctive information in terms of deciding on the\nproperties of regions or voxels within a probed volume \"V\" during any point of\nscanning: threat type, non-threat type, or not-sufficient data. An algorithm\n(MTclear) is being developed to ray-trace muon tracks and count how many\nstraight tracks are passing through a voxel. If a voxel \"v\" has sufficient\nnumber of straight tracks (t), then \"v\" is a non-threat type voxel, unless\nthere are sufficient number of scattering points (p) in \"v\" that will make it a\nthreat-type voxel. The algorithm also keeps track of voxels for which not\nenough information is known: where p and v both fall below their respective\nthreshold parameters. We present preliminary results showing how the algorithm\nworks on data collected with a Muon Tomography station based on gas electron\nmultipliers operated by our group. The MTclear algorithm provides more\ncomprehensive information to a human operator or to a decision algorithm than\nthat provided by conventional muon-tomographic reconstruction algorithms, in\nterms of qualitatively determining the threat possibility from a probed volume.\nThis is quite important because only low numbers of cosmic ray source muons are\ntypically available in nature for tomography, while a quick determination of\nthreats is essential.\n", "  We report measurements of the primary charged particle pseudorapidity density\nand transverse momentum distributions in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$\n= 5.02 TeV, and investigate their correlation with experimental observables\nsensitive to the centrality of the collision. Centrality classes are defined\nusing different event activity estimators, i.e. charged particle multiplicities\nmeasured in three disjunct pseudorapidity regions as well as the energy\nmeasured at beam rapidity (zero-degree). The procedures to determine the\ncentrality, quantified by the number of participants ($N_{\\rm part}$), or the\nnumber of nucleon-nucleon binary collisions ($N_{\\rm coll}$), are described. We\nshow that, in contrast to Pb-Pb collisions, in p-Pb collisions large\nmultiplicity fluctuations together with the small range of participants\navailable, generate a dynamical bias in centrality classes based on particle\nmultiplicity. We propose to use the zero-degree energy, which we expect not to\nintroduce a dynamical bias, as an alternative event-centrality estimator. Based\non zero-degree energy centrality classes, the $N_{\\rm part}$ dependence of\nparticle production is studied. Under the assumption that the multiplicity\nmeasured in the Pb-going rapidity region scales with the number of\nPb-participants, an approximate independence of the multiplicity per\nparticipating nucleon measured at mid-rapitity of the number of participating\nnucleons is observed. Furthermore, at high-$p_{\\rm T}$ the p-Pb spectra are\nfound to be consistent with the pp spectra scaled by $N_{\\rm coll}$ for all\ncentrality classes. Our results represent valuable input for the study of the\nevent activity dependence of hard probes in p-Pb collision and, hence, help to\nestablish baselines for the interpretation of the Pb-Pb data.\n", "  Locating the source that triggers a dynamical process is a fundamental but\nchallenging problem in complex networks, ranging from epidemic spreading in\nsociety and on the Internet to cancer metastasis in the human body. An accurate\nlocalization of the source is inherently limited by our ability to\nsimultaneously access the information of all nodes in a large-scale complex\nnetwork. This thus raises two critical questions: how do we locate the source\nfrom incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of sources at\nany possible location from a given set of observable nodes. Here we develop a\ntime-reversal backward spreading algorithm to locate the source of a\ndiffusion-like process efficiently and propose a general locatability\ncondition. We test the algorithm by employing epidemic spreading and consensus\ndynamics as typical dynamical processes and apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in\nChina. We find that the sources can be precisely located in arbitrary networks\ninsofar as the locatability condition is assured. Our tools greatly improve our\nability to locate the source of diffusion in complex networks based on limited\naccessibility of nodal information. Moreover, they have implications for\ncontrolling a variety of dynamical processes taking place on complex networks,\nsuch as inhibiting epidemics, slowing the spread of rumors, pollution control\nand environmental protection.\n", "  It is important to understand the strong external magnetic field generated at\nthe very beginning of high energy nuclear collisions. We study the effect of\nthe magnetic field on the charmonium yield and anisotropic distribution in\nPb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy. The time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nis employed to describe the motion of $c\\bar{c}$ pairs. We compare our model\nprediction of non- collective anisotropic parameter $v_2$ of $J/\\psi$s with CMS\ndata at high transverse momentum. This is the first attempt to measure the\nmagnetic field in high energy nuclear collisions.\n", "  We have developed a method to accurately and efficiently determine the\nvibrational free energy as a function of temperature and volume for\nsubstitutional alloys from first principles. Taking Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N alloy as\na model system, we calculate the isostructural phase diagram by finding the\nglobal minimum of the free energy, corresponding to the true equilibrium state\nof the system. We demonstrate that the anharmonic contribution and temperature\ndependence of the mixing enthalpy have a decisive impact on the calculated\nphase diagram of a Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N alloy, lowering the maximum temperature\nfor the miscibility gap from 6560 K to 2860 K. Our local chemical composition\nmeasurements on thermally aged Ti$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$N alloys agree with the\ncalculated phase diagram.\n", "  We examine fractional charge and spin errors in self-consistent Green's\nfunction theory within a second-order approximation (GF2). For GF2 it is known\nthat the summation of diagrams resulting from the self-consistent solution of\nthe Dyson equation removes the divergences pathological to second-order\nMoller-Plesset theory (MP2) for strong correlations. In the language often used\nin density functional theory contexts, this means GF2 has a greatly reduced\nfractional spin error relative to MP2. The natural question then is what\neffect, if any, does the Dyson summation have on the fractional charge error in\nGF2? To this end we generalize our previous implementation of GF2 to open-shell\nsystems and analyze its fractional spin and charge errors. We find that like\nMP2, GF2 possesses only a very small fractional charge error, and consequently\nlittle many electron self-interaction error. This shows that GF2 improves on\nthe critical failings of MP2, but without altering the positive features that\nmake it desirable. Furthermore, we find that GF2 has both less fractional\ncharge and fractional spin errors than typical hybrid density functionals as\nwell as random phase approximation with exchange.\n", "  In early 2014, construction of a new watt balance, named NIST-4, has started\nat the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In a watt\nbalance, the gravitational force of an unknown mass is compensated by an\nelectromagnetic force produced by a coil in a magnet system. The\nelectromagnetic force depends on the current in the coil and the magnetic flux\nintegral. Most watt balances feature an additional calibration mode, referred\nto as velocity mode, which allows one to measure the magnetic flux integral to\nhigh precision. In this article we describe first measurements of the flux\nintegral in the new watt balance. We introduce measurement and data analysis\ntechniques to assess the quality of the measurements and the adverse effects of\nvibrations on the instrument.\n", "  In systems with broken inversion symmetry spin-orbit coupling (SOC) yields a\nRashba-type spin splitting of electronic states, manifested in a k-dependent\nsplitting of the bands. While most research had previously focused on 2D\nelectron systems, recently a three-dimensional (3D) form of such Rashba-effect\nwas found in a series of bismuth tellurohalides. Whereas these materials\nexhibit a very large spin-splitting, they lack an important property concerning\nfunctionalization, namely the possibility to switch or tune the spin texture.\nThis limitation can be overcome in a new class of functional materials\ndisplaying Rashba-splitting coupled to ferroelectricity: the ferroelectric\nRashba semiconductors (FERS). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (SARPES) we show that GeTe(111) forms a prime member of this\nclass, displaying a complex spin-texture for the Rashba-split surface and bulk\nbands arising from the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking caused by the\nferroelectric polarization of the bulk (FE). Apart from pure surface and bulk\nstates we find surface-bulk resonant states (SBR) whose wavefunctions entangle\nthe spinors from the bulk and surface contributions. At the Fermi level their\nhybridization results in unconventional spin topologies with cochiral\nhelicities and concomitant gap opening. The GeTe(111) surface and SBR states\nmake the semiconductor surface conducting. At the same time our SARPES data\nconfirm that GeTe is a narrow-gap semiconductor, suggesting that GeTe(111)\nelectronic states are endowed with spin properties that are theoretically\nchallenging to anticipate. As the helicity of the spins in Rashba bands is\nconnected to the direction of the FE polarization, this work paves the way to\nall-electric non-volatile control of spin-transport properties in\nsemiconductors.\n", "  Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice\nwith remarkable mechanical, electrical and optical properties. For the first\ntime graphene layers suspended on copper meshes were installed into a gas\ndetector equipped with a gaseous electron multiplier. Measurements of low\nenergy electron and ion transfer through graphene were conducted. In this paper\nwe describe the sample preparation for suspended graphene layers, the testing\nprocedures and we discuss the preliminary results followed by a prospect of\nfurther applications.\n", "  We investigate the application of the BCFW recursion relation to scattering\namplitudes with one off-shell particle in a Yang-Mills theory with fermions. We\nprovide a set of conditions of applicability of the BCFW recursion, stressing\nsome important differences with respect to the pure on-shell case. We show how\nthe formulas for Maximally-Helicity-Violating (MHV) configurations with any\nnumber of partons, which are well known in the fully on-shell case, are\ngeneralized to this kinematic regime. We also derive analytic expressions for\nall the helicity configurations of the 5-point color-stripped tree-level\namplitudes for any of the partons being off the mass shell.\n", "  This paper deals with semiclassical asymptotics of the three-dimensional\nmagnetic Laplacian in presence of magnetic confinement. Using generic\nassumptions on the geometry of the confinement, we exhibit three semiclassical\nscales and their corresponding effective quantum Hamiltonians, by means of\nthree microlocal normal forms \\`a la Birkhoff. As a consequence, when the\nmagnetic field admits a unique and non degenerate minimum, we are able to\nreduce the spectral analysis of the low-lying eigenvalues to a one-dimensional\n$\\hbar$-pseudo-differential operator whose Weyl's symbol admits an asymptotic\nexpansion in powers of $\\hbar^{\\frac1 2}$.\n", "  The layered transition metal dichalcogenides host a rich collection of charge\ndensity wave (CDW) phases in which both the conduction electrons and the atomic\nstructure display translational symmetry breaking. Manipulating these complex\nstates by purely electronic methods has been a long-sought scientific and\ntechnological goal. Here, we show how this can be achieved in 1T-TaS2 in the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) limit. We first demonstrate that the intrinsic properties\nof atomically-thin flakes are preserved by encapsulation with hexagonal boron\nnitride in inert atmosphere. We use this facile assembly method together with\nTEM and transport measurements to probe the nature of the 2D state and show\nthat its conductance is dominated by discommensurations. The discommensuration\nstructure can be precisely tuned in few-layer samples by an in-plane electric\ncurrent, allowing continuous electrical control over the\ndiscommensuration-melting transition in 2D.\n", "  There is growing experimental interest in coupling cavity photons to the\ncyclotron resonance excitations of electron liquids in high-mobility\nsemiconductor quantum wells or graphene sheets. These media offer unique\nplatforms to carry out fundamental studies of exciton-polariton condensation\nand cavity quantum electrodynamics in a regime in which electron-electron\ninteractions are expected to play a pivotal role. Focusing on graphene, we\npresent a theoretical study of the impact of electron-electron interactions on\na quantum Hall polariton fluid, that is a fluid of magneto-excitons resonantly\ncoupled to cavity photons. We show that electron-electron interactions are\nresponsible for an instability of graphene integer quantum Hall polariton\nfluids towards a modulated phase. We demonstrate that this phase can be\ndetected by measuring the collective excitation spectra, which soften at a\ncharacteristic wave vector of the order of the inverse magnetic length.\n", "  Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging computed imaging\nmodality that exploits optical contrast and ultrasonic detection principles to\nform images of the absorbed optical energy density within tissue. When the\nimaging system employs conventional piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, the\nideal photoacoustic (PA) signals are degraded by the transducers'\nacousto-electric impulse responses (EIRs) during the measurement process. If\nunaccounted for, this can degrade the accuracy of the reconstructed image. In\nprinciple, the effect of the EIRs on the measured PA signals can be ameliorated\nvia deconvolution; images can be reconstructed subsequently by application of a\nreconstruction method that assumes an idealized EIR. Alternatively, the effect\nof the EIR can be incorporated into an imaging model and implicitly compensated\nfor during reconstruction. In either case, the efficacy of the correction can\nbe limited by errors in the assumed EIRs. In this work, a joint optimization\napproach to PACT image reconstruction is proposed for mitigating errors in\nreconstructed images that are caused by use of an inaccurate EIR. The method\nexploits the bi-linear nature of the imaging model and seeks to refine the\nmeasured EIR during the process of reconstructing the sought-after absorbed\noptical energy density. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are\nconducted to investigate the numerical properties of the method and demonstrate\nits value for mitigating image distortions and enhancing the visibility of fine\nstructures.\n", "  We present global radiative transfer models for heated relativistic jets. The\nsimulations include all relevant radiative processes, starting deep in the\nopaque zone and following the evolution of radiation to and beyond the\nphotosphere of the jet. The transfer models are compared with three gamma-ray\nbursts GRB 990123, GRB 090902B, and GRB 130427A, which have well-measured and\ndifferent spectra. The models provide good fits to the observed spectra in all\nthree cases, and we obtain estimates for the jet magnetization parameter\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm B}$ and the Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$. In the small sample of\nthree bursts, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm B}$ varies between 0.01 and 0.05, and $\\Gamma$\nvaries between 400 and 1200.\n", "  We consider a gas of point particles moving on the one-dimensional line with\na hard-core inter-particle interaction that prevents particle crossings ---\nthis is usually referred to as single-file motion. The individual particle\ndynamics can be arbitrary and they only interact when they meet. Starting from\ninitial conditions such that particles are uniformly distributed, we observe\nthe displacement of a tagged particle at time $t$, with respect to the initial\nposition of another tagged particle, such that their tags differ by $r$. For\n$r=0$, this is the usual well studied problem of the tagged particle motion.\nUsing a mapping to a non-interacting particle system we compute the exact\nprobability distribution function for the two-tagged particle displacement, for\ngeneral single particle dynamics. As by-products, we compute the large\ndeviation function, various cumulants and, for the case of Hamiltonian\ndynamics, the two-particle velocity auto-correlation function.\n", "  Nonlinear analysis of the phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuits is a\nchallenging task, thus in modern engineering literature simplified mathematical\nmodels and simulation are widely used for their study. In this work the\nlimitations of numerical approach is discussed and it is shown that, e.g.\nhidden oscillations may not be found by simulation. Corresponding examples in\nSPICE and MatLab, which may lead to wrong conclusions concerning the\noperability of PLL-based circuits, are presented.\n", "  We develop a new approach to the conformal geometry of embedded hypersurfaces\nby treating them as conformal infinities of conformally compact manifolds. This\ninvolves the Loewner--Nirenberg-type problem of finding on the interior a\nmetric that is both conformally compact and of constant scalar curvature. Our\nfirst result is an asymptotic solution to all orders. This involves log terms.\nWe show that the coefficient of the first of these is a new hypersurface\nconformal invariant which generalises to higher dimensions the important\nWillmore invariant of embedded surfaces. We call this the obstruction density.\nFor even dimensional hypersurfaces it is a fundamental curvature invariant. We\nmake the latter notion precise and show that the obstruction density and the\ntrace-free second fundamental form are, in a suitable sense, the only such\ninvariants. We also show that this obstruction to smoothness is a scalar\ndensity analog of the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor for Poincare-Einstein\nmetrics; in part this is achieved by exploiting Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand\nmachinery. The solution to the constant scalar curvature problem provides a\nsmooth hypersurface defining density determined canonically by the embedding up\nto the order of the obstruction. We give two key applications: the construction\nof conformal hypersurface invariants and the construction of conformal\ndifferential operators. In particular we present an infinite family of\nconformal powers of the Laplacian determined canonically by the conformal\nembedding. In general these depend non-trivially on the embedding and, in\ncontrast to Graham-Jennes-Mason-Sparling operators intrinsic to even\ndimensional hypersurfaces, exist to all orders. These extrinsic conformal\nLaplacian powers determine an explicit holographic formula for the obstruction\ndensity.\n", "  Shifts from the expected nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of antimony\nand bismuth donors in silicon of greater than a megahertz are observed in\nelectrically detected magnetic resonance spectra. Defects created by ion\nimplantation of the donors are discussed as the source of effective electric\nfield gradients generating these shifts via quadrupole interaction with the\nnuclear spins. The experimental results are modeled quantitatively by molecular\norbital theory for a coupled pair consisting of a donor and a spin-dependent\nrecombination readout center.\n", "  We present a model for spectrophotometric calibration errors in observations\nof quasars from the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III)\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and describe the correction\nprocedure we have developed and applied to this sample. Calibration errors are\nprimarily due to atmospheric differential refraction and guiding offsets during\neach exposure. The corrections potentially reduce the systematics for any\nstudies of BOSS quasars, including the measurement of baryon acoustic\noscillations using the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest. Our model suggests that, on\naverage, the observed quasar flux in BOSS is overestimated by $\\sim 19\\%$ at\n3600 \\AA\\ and underestimated by $\\sim 24\\%$ at 10,000 \\AA. Our corrections for\nthe entire BOSS quasar sample are publicly available.\n", "  We use fully nonlinear numerical relativity techniques to study high energy\nhead-on collision of nonspinning, equal-mass black holes to estimate the\nmaximum gravitational radiation emitted by these systems. Our simulations\ninclude improvements in the construction of initial data, subsequent full\nnumerical evolutions, and the computation of waveforms at infinity. The new\ninitial data significantly reduces the spurious radiation content, allowing for\ninitial speeds much closer to the speed of light, i.e. $v\\sim0.99c$. Using\nthese new techniques, We estimate the maximum radiated energy from head-on\ncollisions to be $E_{\\text{max}}/M_{\\text{ADM}}=0.13\\pm0.01$. This value\ndiffers from the second-order perturbative $(0.164)$ and zero-frequency-limit\n$(0.17)$ analytic computations, but is close to those obtained by thermodynamic\narguments $(0.134)$ and by previous numerical estimates $(0.14\\pm0.03)$.\n", "  In recent years extensive studies on the Earth's climate system have been\ncarried out by means of advanced complex network statistics. The great majority\nof these studies, however, have been focusing on investigating correlation\nstructures within single climatic fields directly on or parallel to the Earth's\nsurface. Here, we develop a novel approach of node weighted coupled network\nmeasures to study correlations between ocean and atmosphere in the Northern\nHemisphere extratropics and construct 18 coupled climate networks, each\nconsisting of two subnetworks. In all cases, one subnetwork represents monthly\nsea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies, while the other is based on the\nmonthly geopotential height (HGT) of isobaric surfaces at different pressure\nlevels covering the troposphere as well as the lower stratosphere. The weighted\ncross-degree density proves to be consistent with the leading coupled pattern\nobtained from maximum covariance analysis. Network measures of higher order\nallow for a further analysis of the correlation structure between the two\nfields and consistently indicate that in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics\nthe ocean is correlated with the atmosphere in a hierarchical fashion such that\nlarge areas of the ocean surface correlate with multiple statistically\ndissimilar regions in the atmosphere. Ultimately we show that, this observed\nhierarchy is linked to large-scale atmospheric variability patterns, such as\nthe Pacific North American pattern, forcing the ocean on monthly time scales.\n", "  In a recent paper [arXiv:1502.06856] the authors studied numerically the\nhydrogen ground state in stochastic electrodynamics (SED) within the the\nnon-relativistic approximation. In quantum theory the leading non-relativistic\ncorrections to the ground state energy dominate the Lamb shift related to the\nphoton cloud that should cause the quantum-like behaviour of SED. The present\nwork takes these corrections into account in the numerical modelling. It is\nfound that they have little effect; the self-ionisation that occurs without\nthem remains present. It is speculated that the point-charge approximation for\nthe electron is the cause of the failure.\n", "  The case of gluon bremsstrahlung off a heavy quark in extended nuclear matter\nis revisited within the higher twist formalism. In particular, the in-medium\nmodification of \"semi-hard\" heavy quarks is studied, where the momentum of the\nheavy quark is larger but comparable to the mass of the heavy quark ($p \\gtrsim\nM$). In contrast to all prior calculations, where the gluon emission spectrum\nis entirely controlled by the transverse momentum diffusion parameter ($\\hat\nq$), both for light and heavy quarks, in this work, we demonstrate that the\ngluon emission spectrum for a heavy quark (unlike that for flavors) is also\nsensitive to $\\hat e$, which so far has been used to quantify the amount of\nlight-cone drag experienced by a parton. This mass dependent effect, due to the\nnon-light-like momentum of a semi-hard heavy-quark, leads to an additional\nenergy loss term for heavy-quarks, while resulting in a negligible modification\nof light flavor (and high energy heavy flavor) loss. This result can be used to\nestimate the value of this sub-leading non-perturbative jet transport parameter\n($\\hat e$) from heavy flavor suppression in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n", "  This paper is concerned with distributed computation of several commonly used\ncentrality measures in complex networks. In particular, we propose\ndeterministic algorithms, which converge in finite time, for the distributed\ncomputation of the degree, closeness and betweenness centrality measures in\ndirected graphs. Regarding eigenvector centrality, we consider the PageRank\nproblem as its typical variant, and design distributed randomized algorithms to\ncompute PageRank for both fixed and time-varying graphs. A key feature of the\nproposed algorithms is that they do not require to know the network size, which\ncan be simultaneously estimated at every node, and that they are clock-free. To\naddress the PageRank problem of time-varying graphs, we introduce the novel\nconcept of persistent graph, which eliminates the effect of spamming nodes.\nMoreover, we prove that these algorithms converge almost surely and in the\nsense of $L^p$. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is\nillustrated via extensive simulations using a classical benchmark.\n", "  We implement the effects of disorder on a holographic superconductor by\nintroducing a random chemical potential on the boundary. We demonstrate\nexplicitly that increasing disorder leads to the formation of islands where the\nsuperconducting order is enhanced and subsequently to the transition to a\nmetal. We study the behavior of the superfluid density and of the conductivity\nas a function of the strength of disorder. We find explanations for various\nmarked features in the conductivities in terms of hydrodynamic quasi-normal\nmodes of the holographic superconductors. These identifications plus a\nparticular disorder-dependent spectral weight shift in the conductivity point\nto a signature of the Higgs mode in the context of disordered holographic\nsuperconductors. We observe that the behavior of the order parameter close to\nthe transition is not mean-field type as in the clean case, rather we find\nrobust agreement with $\\exp(- A\\, |T-T_c|^{-\\nu})$, with $\\nu =1.03\\pm 0.02 $\nfor this disorder-driven smeared transition.\n", "  We show that Zeeman excitations of ultracold Dy atoms trapped in an optical\nlattice can be used to engineer extended Hubbard models with tunable inter-site\nand particle number-non-conserving interactions. We show that the ratio of the\nhopping amplitude and inter-site interactions in these lattice models can be\ntuned in a wide range by transferring the atoms to different Zeeman states. We\npropose to use the resulting controllable models for the study of the effects\nof direct particle interactions and particle number-non-conserving terms on\nAnderson localization.\n", "  The effects of viscoelasticity on the dynamics and break-up of fluid threads\nin microfluidic T-junctions are investigated using numerical simulations of\ndilute polymer solutions at changing the Capillary number ($\\mbox {Ca}$), i.e.\nat changing the balance between the viscous forces and the surface tension at\nthe interface, up to $\\mbox{Ca} \\approx 3 \\times 10^{-2}$. A Navier-Stokes (NS)\ndescription of the solvent based on the lattice Boltzmann models (LBM) is here\ncoupled to constitutive equations for finite extensible non-linear elastic\ndumbbells with the closure proposed by Peterlin (FENE-P model). We present the\nresults of three-dimensional simulations in a range of $\\mbox{Ca}$ which is\nbroad enough to characterize all the three characteristic mechanisms of breakup\nin the confined T-junction, i.e. ${\\it squeezing}$, ${\\it dripping}$ and ${\\it\njetting}$ regimes. The various model parameters of the FENE-P constitutive\nequations, including the polymer relaxation time $\\tau_P$ and the finite\nextensibility parameter $L^2$, are changed to provide quantitative details on\nhow the dynamics and break-up properties are affected by viscoelasticity. We\nwill analyze cases with ${\\it Droplet ~Viscoelasticity}$ (DV), where\nviscoelastic properties are confined in the dispersed (d) phase, as well as\ncases with ${\\it Matrix ~Viscoelasticity}$ (MV), where viscoelastic properties\nare confined in the continuous (c) phase. Moderate flow-rate ratios $Q \\approx\n{\\cal O}(1)$ of the two phases are considered in the present study. Overall, we\nfind that the effects are more pronounced in the case with MV, as the flow\ndriving the break-up process upstream of the emerging thread can be sensibly\nperturbed by the polymer stresses.\n", "  Based on mesoscale lattice Boltzmann (LB) numerical simulations, we\ninvestigate the effects of viscoelasticity on the break-up of liquid threads in\nmicrofluidic cross-junctions, where droplets are formed by focusing a liquid\nthread of a dispersed (d) phase into another co-flowing continuous (c)\nimmiscible phase. Working at small Capillary numbers, we investigate the\neffects of non-Newtonian phases in the transition from droplet formation at the\ncross-junction (DCJ) to droplet formation downstream of the cross-junction (DC)\n(Liu $\\&$ Zhang, ${\\it Phys. ~Fluids.}$ ${\\bf 23}$, 082101 (2011)). We will\nanalyze cases with ${\\it Droplet ~Viscoelasticity}$ (DV), where viscoelastic\nproperties are confined in the dispersed phase, as well as cases with ${\\it\nMatrix ~Viscoelasticity}$ (MV), where viscoelastic properties are confined in\nthe continuous phase. Moderate flow-rate ratios $Q \\approx {\\cal O}(1)$ of the\ntwo phases are considered in the present study. Overall, we find that the\neffects are more pronounced in the case with MV, where viscoelasticity is found\nto influence the break-up point of the threads, which moves closer to the\ncross-junction and stabilizes. This is attributed to an increase of the polymer\nfeedback stress forming in the corner flows, where the side channels of the\ndevice meet the main channel. Quantitative predictions on the break-up point of\nthe threads are provided as a function of the Deborah number, i.e. the\ndimensionless number measuring the importance of viscoelasticity with respect\nto Capillary forces.\n", "  Flash memory experiences adverse effects due to radiation. These effects can\nbe raised in terms of doping, feature size, supply voltages, layout, shielding.\nThe the operating point shift of the device forced to enter the\nlogically-undefined region and cause upset and data errors under radiation\nexposure. In this letter, the threshold voltage shift of the floating gate\ntransistor (FGT) is analyzed by a mathematical model.\n", "  Flash memory based on floating gate transistor is the most widely used memory\ntechnology in modern microelectronic applications. We recently proposed a new\nconcept of multilayer graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) and carbon nanotube (CNT)\nbased floating gate transistor design for future nanoscale flash memory\ntechnology. In this paper, we analyze the tunneling current mechanism in the\nproposed graphene-CNT floating gate transistor. We anticipate that the proposed\nfloating gate transistor would adopt Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling during its\nprogramming and erase operations. In this paper, we have investigated the\nmechanism of tunneling current and the factors that would influence this\ncurrent and the behavior of the proposed floating gate transistor. The analysis\nreveals that FN tunneling is a strong function of the high field induced by the\ncontrol gate, and the thicknesses of the control oxide and the tunnel oxide.\n", "  In this paper the proofs are given that the electric and magnetic fields are\nproperly defined vectors on the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime (the 4-vectors\nin the usual notation) and not the usual 3D fields. Furthermore, the proofs are\npresented that under the mathematically correct Lorentz transformations (LT),\ne.g., the electric field vector transforms as any other vector transforms,\ni.e., again to the electric field vector; there is no mixing with the magnetic\nfield vector B, as in the usual transformations (UT) of the 3D fields. The\nderivations of the UT from some well-known textbooks are discussed and\nobjected.\n", "  The effects of elasticity on the break-up of liquid threads in microfluidic\ncross-junctions is investigated using numerical simulations based on the\n\"lattice Boltzmann models\" (LBM). Working at small Capillary numbers, we\ninvestigate the effects of non-Newtonian phases in the transition from droplet\nformation at the cross-junction (DCJ) and droplet formation downstream of the\ncross-junction (DC) (Liu & Zhang, ${\\it Phys. Fluids.}$ ${\\bf 23}$, 082101\n(2011)). Viscoelasticity is found to influence the break-up point of the\nthreads, which moves closer to the cross-junction and stabilizes. This is\nattributed to an increase of the polymer feedback stress forming in the corner\nflows, where the side channels of the device meet the main channel.\n", "  The walking technicolor based on the ladder Schwinger-Dyson gap equation is\nstudied, with the scale-invariant coupling being an idealization of the\nCaswell-Banks-Zaks infrared fixed point in the \"anti-Veneziano limit\", such\nthat $N_C \\rightarrow \\infty$ with $N_C \\cdot \\alpha(\\mu^2)=$ fixed and\n$N_F/N_C=$ fixed ($\\gg 1$), of the $SU(N_C)$ gauge theory with massless $N_F$\nflavors near criticality. We show that the 125 GeV Higgs can be naturally\nidentified with the technidilaton (TD) predicted in the walking technicolor, a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the\napproximate scale symmetry. Ladder calculations yield the TD mass $M_\\phi$ from\nthe trace anomaly as $M_\\phi^2 F_\\phi^2= -4 \\langle \\theta_\\mu^\\mu \\rangle = -\n\\frac{\\beta(\\alpha (\\mu^2))}{\\alpha(\\mu^2)}\\, \\langle G_{\\lambda\n\\nu}^2(\\mu^2)\\rangle \\simeq N_C N_F\\frac{16}{\\pi^4} m_F^4$, independently of\nthe renormalization point $\\mu$, where $m_F$ is the dynamical mass of the\ntechnifermion, and $F_\\phi={\\cal O} (\\sqrt{N_F N_C}\\, m_F)$ the TD decay\nconstant. It reads $M_\\phi^2\\simeq (\\frac{v_{\\rm EW}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5 v_{\\rm\nEW}}{F_\\phi})^2 \\cdot [\\frac{8}{N_F}\\frac{4}{N_C}]$, ($v_{\\rm EW}=246$ GeV),\nwhich implies $F_\\phi\\simeq 5 \\,v_{\\rm EW} $ for $M_\\phi \\simeq 125\\, {\\rm\nGeV}\\simeq \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\rm EW}$ in the one-family model ($N_C=4, N_F=8$), in\ngood agreement with the current LHC Higgs data. The result reflects a generic\nscaling $ M_\\phi^2/v_{\\rm EW}^2\\sim M_\\phi^2/F_\\phi^2 \\sim m_F^2 /F_\\phi^2 \\sim\n1/(N_F N_C) \\rightarrow 0 $ as a vanishing trace anomaly, namely the TD has a\nmass vanishing in the anti-Veneziano limit, similarly to $\\eta^\\prime$ meson as\na pseudo-NG boson of the ordinary QCD with vanishing $U(1)_A$ anomaly in the\nVeneziano limit ($N_F/N_C \\ll 1$).\n", "  The response function of graphene is calculated in the presence of a constant\ncurrent across the sample. For small drift velocities and finite chemical\npotential, analytic expressions are obtained and consequences on the plasmonic\nexcitations are discussed. For general drift velocities and zero chemical\npotential, numerical results are presented and a plasmon gain region is\nidentified which is related to interband transitions.\n", "  We implement our past investigations in the quark-antiquark interaction\nthrough a non-perturbative running coupling defined in terms of a gluon mass\nfunction, similar to that used in some Schwinger-Dyson approaches. This\ncoupling leads to a quark-antiquark potential, which satisfies not only\nasymptotic freedom but also describes linear confinement correctly. From this\npotential, we calculate the bottomonium and charmonium spectra below the first\nopen flavor meson-meson thresholds and show that for a small range of values of\nthe free parameter determining the gluon mass function an excellent agreement\nwith data is attained.\n", "  We report complementary experimental, numerical and theoretical study of\nturbulent coflow, counterflow and pure superflow of superfluid He-4 in a\nchannel, resulting in a physically transparent and relatively simple model of\ndecaying quantum turbulence that accounts for interactions of coexisting\nquantum and classical components of turbulent superfluid He-. We further offer\nan analytical theory of the energy spectra of steady-state quantum turbulence\nin the counterflow and pure superflow, based on algebraic approximation for the\nenergy fluxes over scales. The resulting spectra are not of the classic\nKolmogorov form, but strongly suppressed by the mutual friction, leading to the\nenergy dissipation at all scales, enhanced by the counterflow-induced\ndecoupling of the normal- and superfluid velocity fluctuations.\n", "  The temperature-dependent Matsubara Green's function that is used to describe\ntemperature-dependent behavior is expressed on a numerical grid. While such a\ngrid usually has a couple of hundred points for low-energy model systems, for\nrealistic systems in large basis sets the size of an accurate grid can be tens\nof thousands of points, constituting a severe computational and memory\nbottleneck. In this paper, we determine efficient imaginary time grids for the\ntemperature-dependent Matsubara Green's function formalism that can be used for\ncalculations on realistic systems. We show that due to the use of orthogonal\npolynomial transform, we can restrict the imaginary time grid to few hundred\npoints and reach micro-Hartree accuracy in the electronic energy evaluation.\nMoreover, we show that only a limited number of orthogonal polynomial expansion\ncoefficients are necessary to preserve accuracy when working with a dual\nrepresentation of Green's function or self-energy and transforming between the\nimaginary time and Matsubara frequency domain.\n", "  Cracks in thin layers are influenced by what lies beneath them. From buried\ncraters to crocodile skin, crack patterns are found over an enormous range of\nlength scales. Regardless of absolute size, their substrates can dramatically\ninfluence how cracks form, guiding them in some cases, or shielding regions\nfrom them in others. Here we investigate how a substrate's shape affects the\nappearance of cracks above it, by preparing mud cracks over sinusoidally\nvarying surfaces. We find that as the thickness of the cracking layer\nincreases, the observed crack patterns change from wavy to ladder-like to\nisotropic. Two order parameters are introduced to measure the relative\nalignment of these crack networks, and, along with Fourier methods, are used to\ncharacterise the transitions between crack pattern types. Finally, we explain\nthese results with a model, based on the Griffith criteria of fracture, that\nidentifies the conditions for which straight or wavy cracks will be seen, and\npredicts how well-ordered the cracks will be. Our metrics and results can be\napplied to any situation where connected networks of cracks are expected, or\nfound.\n", "  Since the discovery of graphene, layered materials have attracted extensive\ninterests owing to their unique electronic and optical characteristics. Among\nthem, Dirac semimetal, one of the most appealing categories, has been a\nlong-sought objective in layered systems beyond graphene. Recently, layered\npentatelluride ZrTe5 was found to host signatures of Dirac semimetal. However,\nthe low Fermi level in ZrTe5 strongly hinders a comprehensive understanding of\nthe whole picture of electronic states through photoemission measurements,\nespecially in the conduction band. Here, we report the observation of Dirac\nfermions in ZrTe5 through magneto-optics and magneto-transport. By applying\nmagnetic field, we observe a square-root-B dependence of inter-Landau-level\nresonance and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with non-trivial Berry\nphase, both of which are hallmarks of Dirac fermions. The angular-dependent SdH\noscillations show a clear quasi-two-dimensional feature with highly anisotropic\nFermi surface and band topology, in stark contrast to the 3D Dirac semimetal\nsuch as Cd3As2. This is further confirmed by the angle-dependent Berry phase\nmeasurements and the observation of bulk quantum Hall plateaus. The unique band\ndispersion is theoretically understood: the system is at the critical point\nbetween a 3D Dirac semimetal and a topological insulator phase. With the\nconfined interlayer dispersion and reducible dimensionality, our work\nestablishes ZrTe5 as an ideal platform for exploring exotic physical phenomena\nof Dirac fermions.\n", "  Ideal systems like MHD and Euler flow may develop singularities in vorticity\n(w = curl v). Viscosity and resistivity are dissipative regularizations. We\npropose a minimal, local, conservative, nonlinear, dispersive regularization of\ncompressible flow and ideal MHD, in analogy with the KdV regularization of the\n1D Hopf equation. This work significantly extends earlier work on\nincompressible Euler and ideal MHD. It involves a cut-off lambda inversely\nproportional to square-root of density rho, which is like a position-dependent\nmean free path. In MHD, lambda can be taken of order the electron collisionless\nskin depth. The regularizing `twirl' term is - lambda w x curl w. Such a term\ncould be important in high speed flows with vorticity and arise in an expansion\nof kinetic equations in Knudsen number. A magnetic analogue of the twirl term -\n(B x curl B)/(rho mu_0), arises as the Lorentz force in ideal MHD. Our\nregularization preserves symmetries of the ideal systems, and with appropriate\nboundary conditions, implies associated conservation laws. Energy and enstrophy\nare subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data. A Hamiltonian and\nPoisson bracket formulation is developed and used to generalize the\nconstitutive relation to bound higher moments of w and curl w. A `swirl'\nvelocity field is shown to transport w/rho and B/rho, generalizing the\nKelvin-Helmholtz and Alfv\\'en theorems. The steady regularized equations are\nused to model a rotating vortex, MHD pinch, plane vortex sheet, channel flow,\nplane flow and propagating spherical and cylindrical vortices; solutions are\nmore regular than corresponding Eulerian ones. The proposed regularization\ncould facilitate simulations of fluid/MHD equations and provide a consistent\nstatistical mechanics of vortices/current filaments in 3D, without blowup of\nenstrophy. Implications for detailed analyses of fluid and plasma systems are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Exploiting 2D materials for spintronic applications can potentially realize\nnext-generation devices featuring low-power consumption and quantum operation\ncapability. The magnetic exchange field (MEF) induced by an adjacent magnetic\ninsulator enables efficient control of local spin generation and spin\nmodulation in 2D devices without compromising the delicate material structures.\nUsing graphene as a prototypical 2D system, we demonstrate that its coupling to\nthe model magnetic insulator (EuS) produces a substantial MEF (> 14 T) with\npotential to reach hundreds of Tesla, which leads to orders-of-magnitude\nenhancement in the spin signal originated from Zeeman spin-Hall effect.\nFurthermore, the new ferromagnetic ground state of Dirac electrons resulting\nfrom the strong MEF may give rise to quantized spin-polarized edge transport.\nThe MEF effect shown in our graphene/EuS devices therefore provides a key\nfunctionality for future spin logic and memory devices based on emerging 2D\nmaterials in classical and quantum information processing.\n", "  The dark matter in the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 is modelled as an isothermal\nsphere of neutrinos. New data on the $2d$ mass density allow an accurate\ndescription of its core and halo. The model has no \"missing baryon problem\" and\nbeyond $2.1$ Mpc the baryons have the cosmic mass abundance. Combination of\ncluster data with the cosmic dark matter fraction -- here supposed to stem from\nthe neutrinos -- leads to a solution of the dark matter riddle by left and\nright handed neutrinos with mass 1.847 +/- 0.016 eV. The thus far observed\nabsence of neutrinoless double beta decay points to (quasi-) Dirac neutrinos:\nuncharged electrons with different flavour and mass eigenbasis, as for quarks.\nThough the cosmic microwave background spectrum is matched up to some 10\\%\naccuracy only, the case is not ruled out because the plasma phase of the early\nUniverse may be turbulent.\n", "  Though widely accepted, it is not proven that supermassive compact objects\n(SMCOs) residing in galactic centers are black holes. In particular, the Milky\nWay's SMCO can be a giant nontopological soliton, Q-ball, made of a scalar\nfield: this fits perfectly all observational data. Similar but tiny Q-balls\nproduced in the early Universe may constitute, partly or fully, the dark\nmatter. This picture explains in a natural way, why our SMCO has very low\naccretion rate and why the observed angular size of the corresponding radio\nsource is much smaller than expected. Interactions between dark-matter Q-balls\nmay explain how SMCOs were seeded in galaxies and resolve well-known problems\nof standard (non-interacting) dark matter.\n", "  The development, characterization and control of $N$-photon sources are\ninstrumental for quantum technological applications. This work constitutes a\nstep forward in this direction, where we propose a cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics setup designed for the generation of photon pairs. We analyze\nit both via the scattering and master equation formalisms. From the connection\nbetween these two frameworks it naturally arises a physical criterion\ncharacterizing when weakly-driven systems behave as continuous antibunched\ntwo-photon sources. We find the optimal parameters for which our setup works as\nan efficient photon-pair source, showing also that it becomes a deterministic\ndown-converter of single photons. We provide a specific implementation based on\nstate-of-the-art superconducting circuits, showing how our proposal is within\nthe reach of current technologies.\n", "  In this paper, we consider Vannimenus model with competing nearest-neighbors\nand prolonged next-nearest-neighbors interactions on a Cayley tree. For this\nmodel we define Markov random fields with memory of length 2. By using a new\napproach, we obtain new sets of Gibbs measures of Ising-Vannimenus model on\nCayley tree of order 2. We construct the recurrence equations corresponding\nIsing-Vannimenus model. We prove the Kolmogorov consistency condition. We\ninvestigate the translation-invariant and periodic non transition-invariant\nGibbs measures for the model. We find new sets of Gibbs measures different from\nthe Gibbs measures given in the references \\cite{NHSS,FreeMA}. We show that\nsome of the measures are extreme Gibbs distributions.\n", "  In this paper we have shown that squeezed modified quantum vacua have an\neffect on the background geometry by solving the semi-classical Einstein Field\nEquations in modified vacuum. The resultant geometry is similar to (anti) de\nSitter spacetime. This geometry could explain the change of causal structure -\nspeed of light- in such vacua without violating diffeomorphism covariance or\ncausality.The superluminal propagation of photons in Casimir vacuum is deduced\nfrom the effective electromagnetic action in the resultant curved geometry.\nSingling between different vacua is shown not to violate causality as well when\nthe geometric effect on the null rays is considered, causing a refraction of\nthose rays when travelling between unbounded and modified vacua.\n", "  The self-energy embedding theory (SEET), in which the active space\nself-energy is embedded in the self-energy obtained from a perturbative method\ntreating the non-local correlation effects, was recently developed in our\ngroup. In SEET the double counting problem does not appear and the accuracy can\nbe improved either by increasing the perturbation order or by enlarging the\nactive space. This method was first calibrated for the 2D Hubbard lattice\nshowing promising results. In this paper, we report an extension of SEET to\nquantum chemical ab initio Hamiltonians for applications to molecular systems.\nThe self-consistent second-order Green's function (GF2) method is used to\ndescribe the non-local correlations, while the full configuration interaction\n(FCI) method is carried out to capture strong correlation within the active\nspace. Using few proof-of-concept examples, we show that SEET yields results of\ncomparable quality to $n-$electron valence state second-order perturbation\ntheory (NEVPT2) with the same active space, and furthermore, the full active\nspace can be split into smaller active spaces without further implementation.\nMoreover, SEET avoids intruder states and does not require any high-order\nreduced density matrices. These advantages show that SEET is a promising method\nto describe physical and chemical properties of challenging molecules requiring\nlarge active spaces.\n", "  From rhythmic physiological processes to the collective behaviors of\ntechnological and natural networks, coherent phases of interacting oscillators\nare the foundation of the events' coordination leading a system to behave\ncooperatively. We unveil the existence of a new of such states, occurring in\nglobally coupled nonidentical oscillators in the proximity of the point where\nthe transition from the system's incoherent to coherent phase converts from\nexplosive to continuous. In such a state, oscillators form quantized clusters,\nwhere they are neither phase- nor frequency-locked. Oscillators' instantaneous\nspeeds are different within the clusters, but they form a characteristic cusped\npattern and, more importantly, they behave periodically in time so that their\naverage values are the same. Given its intrinsic specular nature with respect\nto the recently introduced Chimera states, the phase is termed the {\\it\nBellerophon} state. We provide analytical and numerical description of the\nmicroscopic and macroscopic details of {\\it Bellerophon} states, thus\nfurnishing practical hints on how to seek for the new phase in a variety of\nexperimental and natural systems.\n", "  Multi-loop interaction amplitudes in the theory of the closed, oriented\nsuperstrings are obtained by the integration of local amplitudes which are\nrepresented by a sum of the spinning string local amplitudes. The last local\namplitudes are given explicitly through super-Schottky group parameters and\ninteraction vertex coordinates on the $(1|1)$ complex supermanifold. The\nintegration is ambiguous under those replacements of the integration variables\nwhich admix Grassmann variables to the boson ones. So the calculation is guided\nby a preservation of local symmetries of the superstring. The obtained\namplitudes are free from divergences and consistent with the world-sheet\nsymmetries. The vacuum amplitude and 1-, 2- and 3-point amplitudes of massless\nstates vanish once the integration over certin modular variables and\ninteraction vertex coordinates.\n", "  Despite recent advances, systematic quantitative treatment of the electron\ncorrelation problem in extended systems remains a formidable task.\nSystematically improvable Green's function methods capable of quantitatively\ndescribing weak and at least qualitatively strong correlations appear promising\ncandidates for computational treatment of periodic systems. We present a\nperiodic implementation of temperature-dependent self-consistent 2nd-order\nGreen's function method (GF2), where the self-energy is evaluated in the basis\nof atomic orbitals. Evaluating the real-space self-energy in atomic orbitals\nand solving the Dyson equation in $\\mathbf{k}$-space are the key components of\na computationally feasible algorithm. We apply this technique to the 1D\nhydrogen lattice - a prototypical crystalline system with a realistic\nHamiltonian. By analyzing the behavior of the spectral functions, natural\noccupations, and self-energies, we claim that GF2 is able to recover metallic,\nband insulating, and at least qualitatively Mott regimes. We observe that the\niterative nature of GF2 is essential to the emergence of the metallic and Mott\nphases.\n", "  We present the 3-8 keV and 8-24 keV number counts of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) identified in the NuSTAR extragalactic surveys. NuSTAR has now resolved\n33-39% of the X-ray background in the 8-24 keV band, directly identifying AGN\nwith obscuring columns up to approximately 1e25 /cm2. In the softer 3-8 keV\nband the number counts are in general agreement with those measured by\nXMM-Newton and Chandra over the flux range 5e-15 < S(3 - 8 keV)/(erg/cm2/s) <\n1e-12 probed by NuSTAR. In the hard 8-24 keV band NuSTAR probes fluxes over the\nrange 2e-14 < S(8-24 keV)/(erg/cm2/s) < 1e-12, a factor of approximately 100\nfainter than previous measurements. The 8-24 keV number counts match\npredictions from AGN population synthesis models, directly confirming the\nexistence of a population of obscured and/or hard X-ray sources inferred from\nthe shape of the integrated cosmic X-ray background. The measured NuSTAR counts\nlie significantly above simple extrapolation with a Euclidian slope to low flux\nof the Swift/BAT 15-55 keV number counts measured at higher fluxes S(15-55 keV)\n> 1e-11 erg/cm2/s, reflecting the evolution of the AGN population between the\nSwift/BAT local (z<0.1) sample and NuSTAR's z~1 sample. CXB synthesis models,\nwhich account for AGN evolution, lie above the Swift/BAT measurements,\nsuggesting that they do not fully capture the evolution of obscured AGN at low\nredshifts.\n", "  We analyze transverse momentum ($Q_T$) resummation of a colorless final\nstate, e.g. Higgs production in gluon fusion or the production of a lepton pair\nvia the Drell-Yan mechanism, in the limit where the invariant mass of the final\nstate is much less then the center-of-mass energy, i.e. $Q^2\\ll s$. We show how\nthe traditional resummation of logarithms of $Q_T/Q$ can be supplemented with\nthe resummation of the leading logarithmic contributions at small $x=Q^2/s$ and\nwe compute the necessary ingredients to perform such joint resummation.\n", "  Conventional photocells suffer a fundamental efficiency threshold imposed by\nthe principle of detailed balance, reflecting the fact that good absorbers must\nnecessarily also be fast emitters. This limitation can be overcome by `parking'\nthe energy of an absorbed photon in a dark state which neither absorbs nor\nemits light. Here we argue that suitable dark states occur naturally as a\nconsequence of the dipole-dipole interaction between two proximal optical\ndipoles for a wide range of realistic molecular dimers. We develop an intuitive\nmodel of a photocell comprising two light-absorbing molecules coupled to an\nidealised reaction centre, showing asymmetric dimers are capable of providing a\nsignificant enhancement of light-to-current conversion under ambient\nconditions. We conclude by describing a roadmap for identifying suitable\nmolecular dimers for demonstrating this effect by screening a very large set of\npossible candidate molecules.\n", "  Galaxies represent one of the preferred candidate sources to drive the\nreionization of the universe. Even as gains are made in mapping the galaxy UV\nluminosity density to z>6, significant uncertainties remain regarding the\nconversion to the implied ionizing emissivity. The relevant unknowns are the\nLyman-continuum (LyC) photon production efficiency xi_{ion} and the escape\nfraction f_{esc}. As we show here, the first of these unknowns is directly\nmeasureable in z=4-5 galaxies, based on the impact the Halpha line has on the\nobserved IRAC fluxes. By computing a LyC photon production rate from the\nimplied Halpha luminosities for a broad selection of z=4-5 galaxies and\ncomparing this against the dust-corrected UV-continuum luminosities, we provide\nthe first-ever direct estimates of the LyC photon production efficiency\nxi_{ion} for the z>~4 galaxy population. We find log_{10} xi_{ion}/[Hz/ergs] to\nhave a mean value of 25.27_{-0.03}^{+0.03} and 25.34_{-0.02}^{+0.02} for sub-L*\nz=4-5 galaxies adopting Calzetti and SMC dust laws, respectively. Reassuringly,\nboth values are consistent with standardly assumed xi_{ion}'s in reionization\nmodels, with a slight preference for higher xi_{ion}'s (by ~0.1 dex) adopting\nthe SMC dust law. A modest ~0.03-dex increase in these estimates would result\nif the escape fraction for ionizing photons is non-zero and galaxies dominate\nthe ionizing emissivity at z~4.4. High values of xi_{ion} (~25.5-25.8 dex) are\nderived for the bluest galaxies (beta<-2.3) in our samples, independent of dust\nlaw and consistent with results for a z=7.045 galaxy. Such elevated values of\nxi_{ion} would have important consequences, indicating that f_{esc} cannot be\nin excess of 13% unless the galaxy UV luminosity function does not extend down\nto -13 mag or the clumping factor is greater than 3. A low escape fraction\nwould fit well with the low rate of LyC leakage observed at z~3.\n", "  Small-diameter muon drift tube (sMDT) chambers are a cost-effective\ntechnology for high-precision muon tracking. The rate capability of the sMDT\nchambers has been extensively tested at the Gamma Irradiation Facility at CERN\nin view of expected rates at future high-energy hadron colliders. Results show\nthat it fulfills the requirements over most of the acceptance of muon\ndetectors. The optimization of the read-out electronics to further increase the\nrate capability of the detectors is discussed. Chambers of this type are under\nconstruction for upgrades of the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector at\nhigh LHC luminosities. Design and construction procedures have been optimized\nfor mass production while providing a precision of better than 10 micrometers\nin the sense wire positions and the mechanical stability required to cover\nlarge areas.\n", "  Highly selective first-level triggers are essential to exploit the full\nphysics potential of the ATLAS experiment at High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The\nconcept for a new muon trigger stage using the precision monitored drift tube\n(MDT) chambers to significantly improve the selectivity of the first-level muon\ntrigger is presented. It is based on fast track reconstruction in all three\nlayers of the existing MDT chambers, made possible by an extension of the\nfirst-level trigger latency to six microseconds and a new MDT read-out\nelectronics required for the higher overall trigger rates at the HL-LHC. Data\nfrom $pp$-collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ is used to study the\nminimal muon transverse momentum resolution that can be obtained using the MDT\nprecision chambers, and to estimate the resolution and efficiency of the\nMDT-based trigger. A resolution of better than $4.1\\%$ is found in all sectors\nunder study. With this resolution, a first-level trigger with a threshold of\n$18\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ becomes fully efficient for muons with a transverse momentum\nabove $24\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ in the barrel, and above $20\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ in the\nend-cap region.\n", "  The realization of reliable quantum channels, able to transfer a quantum\nstate with high fidelity, is a fundamental step in the construction of scalable\nquantum devices. In this paper we describe a transmission scheme based on the\ngenuinely quantum effect known as Bloch oscillations. The proposed protocol\nmakes it possible to carry quantum state over different distances with a\nminimal engineering of the transmission medium and can be implemented and\nverified on current quantum technology hardware.\n", "  This paper is concerned with stochastic SIR and SEIR epidemic models on\nrandom networks in which individuals may rewire away from infected neighbors at\nsome rate $\\omega$ (and reconnect to non-infectious individuals with\nprobability $\\alpha$ or else simply drop the edge if $\\alpha=0$), so-called\npreventive rewiring. The models are denoted SIR-$\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\omega$, and\nwe focus attention on the early stages of an outbreak, where we derive\nexpression for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and the expected degree of\nthe infectious nodes $E(D_I)$ using two different approximation approaches. The\nfirst approach approximates the early spread of an epidemic by a branching\nprocess, whereas the second one uses pair approximation. The expressions are\ncompared with the corresponding empirical means obtained from stochastic\nsimulations of SIR-$\\omega$ and SEIR-$\\omega$ epidemics on Poisson and\nscale-free networks. Without rewiring of exposed nodes, the two approaches\npredict the same epidemic threshold and the same $E(D_I)$ for both types of\nepidemics, the latter being very close to the mean degree obtained from\nsimulated epidemics over Poisson networks. Above the epidemic threshold,\npairwise models overestimate the value of $R_0$ computed from simulations,\nwhich turns out to be very close to the one predicted by the branching process\napproximation. When exposed individuals also rewire with $\\alpha > 0$ (perhaps\nunaware of being infected), the two approaches give different epidemic\nthresholds, with the branching process approximation being more in agreement\nwith simulations.\n", "  The methods for studying the epoch of cosmic reionization vary from full\nradiative transfer simulations to purely analytical models. While numerical\napproaches are computationally expensive and are not suitable for generating\nmany mock catalogs, analytical methods are based on assumptions and\napproximations. We explore the interconnection between both methods. First, we\nask how the analytical framework of excursion set formalism can be used for\nstatistical analysis of numerical simulations and visual representation of the\nmorphology of ionization fronts. Second, we explore the methods of training the\nanalytical model on a given numerical simulation. We present a new code which\nemerged from this study. Its main application is to match the analytical model\nwith a numerical simulation. Then, it allows one to generate mock reionization\ncatalogs with volumes exceeding the original simulation quickly and\ncomputationally inexpensively, meanwhile reproducing large scale statistical\nproperties. These mock catalogs are particularly useful for CMB polarization\nand 21cm experiments, where large volumes are required to simulate the observed\nsignal.\n", "  A comprehensive mapping of the spin polarization of the electronic bands in\nferroelectric a-GeTe(111) films has been performed using a time-of-flight\nmomentum microscope equipped with an imaging spin filter that enables a\nsimultaneous measurement of more than 10.000 data points (voxels). A Rashba\ntype splitting of both surface and bulk bands with opposite spin helicity of\nthe inner and outer Rashba bands is found revealing a complex spin texture at\nthe Fermi energy. The switchable inner electric field of GeTe implies new\nfunctionalities for spintronic devices.\n", "  We show that in Pr$ _{0.5} $La$ _{0.2} $Ca$ _{0.3} $MnO$ _{3} $/YBa$ _{2}\n$Cu$ _{3} $O$ _{7} $ (PLCMO/YBCO) multilayers the low temperature state of YBCO\nis very resistive and resembles the one of a granular superconductor or a\nfrustrated Josephson-junction network. Notably, a coherent superconducting\nresponse can be restored with a large magnetic field which also suppresses the\ncharge-orbital order in PLCMO. This coincidence suggests that the granular\nsuperconducting state of YBCO is induced by the charge-orbital order of PLCMO.\nThe coupling mechanism and the nature of the induced inhomogeneous state in\nYBCO remain to be understood.\n", "  We consider radiative processes of a quantum system composed by two identical\ntwo-level atoms in a black-hole background. We assume that these identical\ntwo-level atoms are placed at fixed radial distances outside a Schwarzschild\nblack hole and interacting with a quantum electromagnetic field prepared in one\nof the usual vacuum states, namely the Boulware, Unruh or the Hartle-Hawking\nvacuum states. We study the structure of the rate of variation of the atomic\nenergy. The intention is to identify in a quantitative way the contributions of\nvacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction to the entanglement generation\nbetween the atoms as well as the degradation of entangled states in the\npresence of an event horizon. We find that for a finite observation time the\natoms can become entangled for the case of the field in the Boulware vacuum\nstate, even if they are initially prepared in a separable state. In addition,\nthe rate of variation of atomic energy is not well behaved at the event horizon\ndue to the behavior of the proper accelerations of the atoms. We show that the\nthermal nature of the Hartle-Hawking and Unruh vacuum state allows the atoms to\nget entangled even if they were initially prepared in the separable ground\nstate.\n", "  Heusler compounds offer potential as spintronic devices due to their\nspin-polarization and half-metallicity properties, where electron spin-majority\n(minority) manifold exhibits states (band gap) at the electronic chemical\npotential, yielding full spin-polarization in a single manifold. Yet, Heuslers\noften exhibit intrinsic disorder that degrades its half-metallicity and\nspin-polarization. Using density-functional theory, we analyze the electronic\nand magnetic properties of equiatomic Heusler ($L$2$_{1}$) CoMnCrAl and\nCoFeCrGe alloys for effects of hydrostatic pressure and intrinsic disorder\n(thermal antisites, binary swaps, and vacancies). Under pressure, CoMnCrAl\nundergoes a metallic transition, while half-metallicity in CoFeCrGe is retained\nfor a limited range. Antisite disorder between Co-Al pairs in CoMnCrAl and\nCo-Ge pairs in CoFeCrGe is energetically the most favored, and retain\nhalf-metallic character in Co-excess samples. However, Co-deficient samples\nundergo a transition from half-metallic to metallic, with a discontinuity in\nthe saturation magnetization. For binary swaps, configurations that compete\nwith the ground state are identified and show no loss of half-metallicity;\nhowever, the minority-spin bandgap and magnetic moments vary depending on the\natoms swapped. For single binary swaps, there is a significant energy cost in\nCoMnCrAl but with no loss of half metallicity. Although a few configurations in\nCoFeCrGe energetically compete with the ground statei, however the\nminority-spin bandgap and magnetic moments vary depending on the atoms swapped.\nThese informations should help in controlling these potential spintronic\nmaterials.\n", "  The perspective of statistical state dynamics (SSD) has recently been applied\nto the study of mechanisms underlying turbulence in various physical systems.\nAn example implementation of SSD is the second order closure referred to as\nstochastic structural stability theory (S3T), which has provided insight into\nthe dynamics of wall turbulence and specifically the emergence and maintenance\nof the roll/streak structure. This closure eliminates nonlinear interactions\namong the perturbations has been removed, restricting nonlinearity in the\ndynamics to that of the mean equation and the interaction between the mean and\nperturbation covariance. Here, this quasi-linear restriction of the dynamics is\nused to study the structure and dynamics of turbulence in plane Poiseuille flow\nat moderately high Reynolds numbers in a closely related dynamical system,\nreferred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) system. RNL simulations reveal\nthat the essential features of wall-turbulence dynamics are retained.\nRemarkably, the RNL system spontaneously limits the support of its turbulence\nto a small set of streamwise Fourier components giving rise to a naturally\nminimal representation of its turbulence dynamics. Although greatly simplified,\nthis RNL turbulence exhibits natural-looking structures and statistics.\nSurprisingly, even when further truncation of the perturbation support to a\nsingle streamwise component is imposed the RNL system continues to produce\nself-sustaining turbulent structure and dynamics. RNL turbulence at the\nReynolds numbers studied is dominated by the roll/streak structure in the\nbuffer layer and similar very-large-scale structure (VLSM) in the outer layer.\nDiagnostics of the structure, spectrum and energetics of RNL and DNS turbulence\nare used to demonstrate that the roll/streak dynamics supporting the turbulence\nin the buffer and logarithmic layer is essentially similar in RNL and DNS.\n", "  We study numerically the nonlinear stage of modulational instability (MI) of\ncnoidal waves, in the framework of the focusing one-dimensional Nonlinear\nSchrodinger (NLS) equation. Cnoidal waves are the exact periodic solutions of\nthe NLS equation and can be represented as a lattice of overlapping solitons.\nMI of these lattices lead to development of \"integrable turbulence\" [Zakharov\nV.E., Stud. Appl. Math. 122, 219-234 (2009)]. We study the major\ncharacteristics of the turbulence for dn-branch of cnoidal waves and\ndemonstrate how these characteristics depend on the degree of \"overlapping\"\nbetween the solitons within the cnoidal wave.\n  Integrable turbulence, that develops from MI of dn-branch of cnoidal waves,\nasymptotically approaches to it's stationary state in oscillatory way. During\nthis process kinetic and potential energies oscillate around their asymptotic\nvalues. The amplitudes of these oscillations decay with time as t^{-a},\n1<a<1.5, the phases contain nonlinear phase shift decaying as t^{-1/2}, and the\nfrequency of the oscillations is equal to the double maximal growth rate of the\nMI, s=2g_{max}. In the asymptotic stationary state the ratio of potential to\nkinetic energy is equal to -2. The asymptotic PDF of wave amplitudes is close\nto Rayleigh distribution for cnoidal waves with strong overlapping, and is\nsignificantly non-Rayleigh one for cnoidal waves with weak overlapping of\nsolitons. In the latter case the dynamics of the system reduces to two-soliton\ncollisions, which occur with exponentially small rate and provide up to\ntwo-fold increase in amplitude compared with the original cnoidal wave.\n", "  We consider the $\\gamma$-deformed $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in the double scaling\nlimit of large imaginary twists and small coupling, which discards the gauge\nfields and retains only certain Yukawa and scalar interactions with three\narbitrary effective couplings. In the 't~Hooft limit, these 4D theories are\nintegrable, with most of the correlators being conformal such that the whole\narsenal of AdS/CFT integrability remains applicable. In particular, for one\nnon-zero effective coupling, we obtain a QFT of two complex scalars with a\nchiral, quartic interaction. The BMN vacuum anomalous dimension is dominated in\neach non-zero loop order by a single \"wheel\" graph, in principle computable by\nintegrability. Thus we also provide an explicit conjecture for the periods of\ndouble-wheel graphs with an arbitrary number of spokes.\n", "  We are concerned with the two-dimensional steady supersonic reacting Euler\nflow past Lipschitz bending walls that are small perturbations of a convex one,\nand establish the existence of global entropy solutions when the total\nvariation of both the initial data and the slope of the boundary is\nsufficiently small. The flow is governed by an ideal polytropic gas and\nundergoes a one-step exothermic chemical reaction under the reaction rate\nfunction that is Lipschtiz and has a positive lower bound. The heat released by\nthe reaction may cause the total variation of the solution to increase along\nthe flow direction. We employ the modified wave-front tracking scheme to\nconstruct approximate solutions and develop a Glimm-type functional by\nincorporating the approximate strong rarefaction waves and Lipschitz bending\nwalls to obtain the uniform bound on the total variation of the approximate\nsolutions. Then we employ this bound to prove the convergence of the\napproximate solutions to a global entropy solution that contains a strong\nrarefaction wave generated by the Lipschitz bending wall. In addition, the\nasymptotic behavior of the entropy solution in the flow direction is also\nanalyzed.\n", "  Inferior soft-tissue contrast resolution is a major limitation of current CT\nscanners. The aim of the study is to improve the contrast resolution of CT\nscanners using dual-energy acquisition. Based on dual-energy material\ndecomposition, the proposed method starts with extracting the outgoing energy\nspectrum by polychromatic forward projecting the material-selective images. The\nextracted spectrum is then reweighted to boost the soft-tissue contrast. A\nsimulated water cylinder phantom with inserts that contain a series of six\nsolutions of varying iodine concentration (range, 0-20 mg/mL) is used to\nevaluate the proposed method. Results show the root mean square error (RMSE)\nand mean energy difference between the extracted energy spectrum and the\nspectrum acquired using an energy-resolved photon counting detector(PCD), are\n0.044 and 0.01 keV, respectively. Compared to the method using the standard\nenergy-integrating detectors, dose normalized contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRD)\nfor the proposed method are improved from 1 to 2.15 and from 1 to 1.88 for the\n8 mg/mL and 16 mg/mL iodine concentration inserts, respectively. The results\nshow CT image reconstructed using the proposed method is superior to the image\nreconstructed using the standard method that using an energy-integrating\ndetector.\n", "  Nonlocal correlations arising from measurements on tripartite entangled\nstates can be classified into two groups, one genuinely $3-$way nonlocal and\nother local with respect to some bipartition. Still, whether a genuinely\ntripartite entangled quantum state can exhibit genuine $3-$way nonlocality,\nremains a challenging problem so far as measurement context is concerned. Here\nwe introduce a novel approach in this regard. We consider three tripartite\nquantum states none of which is genuinely $3-$way nonlocal in a specific Bell\nscenario (three parties, two measurements per party, two outcomes per\nmeasurement), but they can exhibit genuine $3-$way nonlocality when the initial\nstates are subjected to stochastic local operations and classical communication\n(SLOCC). So, genuine $3-$way nonlocality is a resource, which can be revealed\nby using a sequence of measurements.\n", "  We propose a novel type of ergostats and thermostats for molecular dynamics\nsimulations. A general class of active particle swarm models is considered,\nwhere any specific total energy (alternatively any specific temperature) can be\nprovided at a fixed point of the evolution of the swarm. We identify the\nextended system feedback force of the Nos\\'e - Hoover thermostat with the\n\"internal energy\" variable of active Brownian motion.\n", "  Three- and four-pion Bose-Einstein correlations are presented in pp, p-Pb,\nand Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. We compare our measured four-pion correlations\nto the expectation derived from two- and three-pion measurements. Such a\ncomparison provides a method to search for coherent pion emission. We also\npresent mixed-charge correlations in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nseveral analysis procedures such as Coulomb corrections. Same-charge four-pion\ncorrelations in pp and p-Pb appear consistent with the expectations from\nthree-pion measurements. However, the presence of non-negligible background\ncorrelations in both systems prevent a conclusive statement. In Pb-Pb\ncollisions, we observe a significant suppression of three- and four-pion\nBose-Einstein correlations compared to expectations from two-pion measurements.\nThere appears to be no centrality dependence of the suppression within the\n0-50% centrality interval. The origin of the suppression is not clear. However,\nby postulating either coherent pion emission or large multibody Coulomb\neffects, the suppression may be explained.\n", "  We have acquired Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Telescope\nnear-infrared spectra and images of supernova (SN) Refsdal after its discovery\nas an Einstein cross in Fall 2014. The HST light curve of SN Refsdal matches\nthe distinctive, slowly rising light curves of SN 1987A-like supernovae (SNe),\nand we find strong evidence for a broad H-alpha P-Cygni profile in the HST\ngrism spectrum at the redshift (z = 1.49) of the spiral host galaxy. SNe IIn,\npowered by circumstellar interaction, could provide a good match to the light\ncurve of SN Refsdal, but the spectrum of a SN IIn would not show broad and\nstrong H-alpha absorption. From the grism spectrum, we measure an H-alpha\nexpansion velocity consistent with those of SN 1987A-like SNe at a similar\nphase. The luminosity, evolution, and Gaussian profile of the H-alpha emission\nof the WFC3 and X-shooter spectra, separated by ~2.5 months in the rest frame,\nprovide additional evidence that supports the SN 1987A-like classification. In\ncomparison with other examples of SN 1987A-like SNe, SN Refsdal has a blue B-V\ncolor and a high luminosity for the assumed range of potential magnifications.\nIf SN Refsdal can be modeled as a scaled version of SN 1987A, we estimate it\nwould have an ejecta mass of 20+-5 solar masses. The evolution of the light\ncurve at late times will provide additional evidence about the potential\nexistence of any substantial circumstellar material (CSM). Using MOSFIRE and\nX-shooter spectra, we estimate a subsolar host-galaxy metallicity (8.3+-0.1 dex\nand <8.4 dex, respectively) near the explosion site.\n", "  We consider a macroscopic disordered system of free $d$-dimensional lattice\nfermions whose one-body Hamiltonian is a Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator $H$ with\nergodic potential. We assume that the Fermi energy lies in the exponentially\nlocalized part of the spectrum of $H$. We prove that if $S_\\Lambda$ is the\nentanglement entropy of a lattice cube $\\Lambda$ of side length $L$ of the\nsystem, then for any $d \\ge 1$ the expectation $\\mathbf{\nE}\\{L^{-(d-1)}S_\\Lambda\\}$ has a finite limit as $L \\to \\infty$ and we identify\nthe limit. Next, we prove that for $d=1$ the entanglement entropy admits a well\ndefined asymptotic form for all typical realizations (with probability 1) as $\nL \\to \\infty$. According to numerical results of [33] the limit is not\nselfaveraging even for an i.i.d. potential. On the other hand, we show that for\n$d \\ge 2$ and an i.i.d. random potential the variance of $L^{-(d-1)}S_\\Lambda$\ndecays polynomially as $L \\to \\infty$, i.e., the entanglement entropy is\nselfaveraging.\n", "  We analyze the effect of the Basset history force on the sedimentation of\nnearly neutrally buoyant particles, exemplified by marine snow, in a\nthree-dimensional turbulent flow. Particles are characterized by Stokes numbers\nmuch smaller than unity, and still water settling velocities, measured in units\nof the Kolmogorov velocity, of order one. The presence of the history force in\nthe Maxey-Riley equation leads to individual trajectories which differ strongly\nfrom the dynamics of both inertial particles without this force, and ideal\nsettling tracers. When considering, however, a large ensemble of particles, the\nstatistical properties of all three dynamics become more similar. The main\neffect of the history force is a rather slow, power-law type convergence to an\nasymptotic settling velocity of the center of mass, which is found numerically\nto be the settling velocity in still fluid. The spatial extension of the\nensemble grows diffusively after an initial ballistic growth lasting up to ca.\none large eddy turnover time. We demonstrate that the settling of the center of\nmass for such light aggregates is best approximated by the settling dynamics in\nstill fluid found with the history force, on top of which fluctuations appear\nwhich follow very closely those of the turbulent velocity field.\n", "  We present a dimensional reduction argument to derive the classification\nreduction of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases in the presence of\ninteractions. The dimensional reduction proceeds by relating the topological\ncharacter of a $d$-dimensional system to the number of zero-energy bound states\nlocalized at zero-dimensional topological defects present at its surface. This\ncorrespondence leads to a general condition for symmetry preserving\ninteractions that render the system topologically trivial, and allows us to\nexplicitly write a quartic interaction to this end. Our reduction shows that\nall phases with topological invariant smaller than $n$ are topologically\ndistinct, thereby reducing the non-interacting $\\mathbb{Z}$ classification to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n", "  We have extended a previous calculation of the energy of a weakly\nheterogeneous waveguide to fourth order in the density perturbation, deriving\nits general expression. For particular configurations where the second and\nthird orders both vanish, we discover that the fourth order contribution lowers\nin general the energy of the state, below the threshold of the continuum. In\nthese cases the waveguide possesses a localized state. We have applied our\ngeneral formula to a solvable model with vanishing second and third orders\nreproducing the exact expression for the fourth order.\n", "  Atom interferometers provide exquisite measurements of the properties of\nnon-inertial frames. While atomic interactions are typically detrimental to\ngood sensing, efforts to harness entanglement to improve sensitivity remain\ntantalizing. Here we explore the role of interactions in an analogy between\natomic gyroscopes and SQUIDs, motivated by recent experiments realizing ring\nshaped traps for ultracold atoms. We explore the one-dimensional limit of these\nring systems with a moving weak barrier, such as that provided by a\nblue-detuned laser beam. In this limit, we employ Luttinger liquid theory and\nfind an analogy with the superconducting phase-slip qubit, in which the\ntopological charge associated with persistent currents can be put into\nsuperposition. In particular, we find that strongly-interacting atoms in such a\nsystem could be used for precision rotation sensing. We compare the performance\nof this new sensor to an equivalent non-interacting atom interferometer, and\nfind improvements in sensitivity and bandwidth beyond the atomic shot-noise\nlimit.\n", "  Controlling magnetism with electric fields is a key challenge to develop\nfuture energy-efficient devices, however, the switching between inversion\nsymmetric states, e.g. magnetization up and down as used in current technology,\nis not straightforward, since the electric field does not break time-reversal\nsymmetry. Here, we demonstrate that local electric fields can be used to\nreversibly switch between a magnetic skyrmion and the ferromagnetic state.\nThese two states are topologically inequivalent, and we find that the direction\nof an electric field directly determines the final state. This observation\nestablishes the possibility to combine energy-efficient electric field writing\nwith the recently envisaged skyrmion racetrack-type memories.\n", "  Feynman's prescription for a quantum simulator was to find a hamitonian for a\nsystem that could serve as a computer. P\\'olya and Hilbert conjecture was to\ndemonstrate Riemann's hypothesis through the spectral decomposition of\nhermitian operators. Here we study the problem of decomposing a number into its\nprime factors, $N=xy$, using such a simulator. First, we derive the hamiltonian\nof the physical system that simulate a new arithmetic function, formulated for\nthe factorization problem, that represents the energy of the computer. This\nfunction rests alone on the primes below $\\sqrt N$. We exactly solve the\nspectrum of the quantum system without resorting to any external ad-hoc\nconditions, also showing that it obtains, for $x\\ll \\sqrt{N}$, a prediction of\nthe prime counting function that is almost identical to Riemann's $R(x)$\nfunction. It has no counterpart in analytic number theory and its derivation is\na consequence of the quantum theory of the simulator alone.\n", "  Bosonic channels are important in practice as they form a simple model for\nfree-space or fiber-optic communication. Here we consider a single-sender\ntwo-receiver pure-loss bosonic broadcast channel and determine the\nunconstrained capacity region for the distillation of bipartite entanglement\nand secret key between the sender and each receiver, whenever they are allowed\narbitrary public classical communication. We show how the state merging\nprotocol leads to achievable rates in this setting, giving an inner bound on\nthe capacity region. We also evaluate an outer bound on the region by using the\nrelative entropy of entanglement and a `reduction by teleportation' technique.\nThe outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby\nestablishing the unconstrained capacity region for such channels. Our result\ncould provide a useful benchmark for implementing a broadcasting of\nentanglement and secret key through such channels. An important open question\nrelevant to practice is to determine the capacity region in both this setting\nand the single-sender single-receiver case when there is an energy constraint\non the transmitter.\n", "  We calculate the spectrum and the total rate of created particles for a real\nmassless scalar field in $1+1$ dimensions, in the presence of a partially\ntransparent moving mirror simulated by a Dirac $\\delta-\\delta^{\\prime}$ point\ninteraction. We show that, for this model, a partially reflecting mirror can\nproduce a larger number of particles in comparison with a perfect one. In the\nlimit of a perfect mirror, our formulas recover those found in the literature\nfor the particle creation by a moving mirror with a Robin boundary condition.\n", "  We report the large polar magnetooptical Kerr effect in L10-MnxGa epitaxial\nfilms with giant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in a wide composition range.\nThe Kerr rotation was enhanced by a factor of up to 10 by decreasing Mn atomic\nconcentration, which most likely arises from the variation of the effective\nspin-orbit coupling strength, compensation effect of magnetic moments at\ndifferent Mn atom sites, and overall strain. The Kerr ellipticity and the\nmagnitude of the complex Kerr angle is found to have more complex\ncomposition-dependence that varies with the photon energy. These L10-MnxGa\nfilms show large Kerr rotation of up to 0.10o, high reflectivity of 35%-55% in\na wide wavelength range of 400~850 nm, and giant magnetic anisotropic field of\nup to 210 kOe, making them an interesting material system for emerging\nspintronics and terahertz modulator applications.\n", "  Recent reports of spin-orbit coupling enhancement in chemically modified\ngraphene have opened doors to studies of the spin Hall effect with massless\nchiral fermions. Here, we theoretically investigate the interaction and\nimpurity density dependence of the extrinsic spin Hall effect in spin-orbit\ncoupled graphene. We present a nonperturbative quantum diagrammatic calculation\nof the spin Hall response function in the strong-coupling regime that\nincorporates skew scattering and anomalous impurity density-independent\ncontributions on equal footing. The spin Hall conductivity dependence on Fermi\nenergy and electron-impurity interaction strength reveals the existence of\nexperimentally accessible regions where anomalous quantum processes dominate.\nOur findings suggest that spin-orbit-coupled graphene is an ideal model system\nfor probing the competition between semiclassical and bona fide quantum\nscattering mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect.\n", "  In this note we further develop the duality between supersymmetric gauge\ntheories in various dimensions and elliptic integrable systems such as\nRuijsenaars-Schneider model and periodic intermediate long wave hydrodynamics.\nThese models arise in instanton counting problems and are described by certain\nelliptic algebras. We discuss the correspondence between the two types of\nmodels by employing the large-n limit of the dual gauge theory. In particular\nwe provide non-Abelian generalization of our previous result on the\nintermediate long wave model.\n", "  We develop an universal method to significantly suppress probe-induced shifts\nin any types of atomic clocks using the Ramsey spectroscopy. Our approach is\nbased on adaptation of the synthetic frequency concept [V. I. Yudin, et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 107, 030801 (2011)] (previously developed for BBR shift\nsuppression) to the Ramsey spectroscopy with the use of interrogations for\ndifferent dark time intervals. Universality of the method consists in\narbitrariness of the possible Ramsey schemes. However, most extremal results\nare obtained in combination with so-called hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy [V. I.\nYudin, et al., Phys. Rev. A 82, 011804(R) (2010)]. In the latter case, the\nprobe-induced frequency shifts can be suppressed considerably below a\nfractional level of 10$^{-18}$ practically for any optical atomic clocks, where\nthis shift previously was metrologically significant. The main advantage of our\nmethod in comparison with other radical hyper-Ramsey approaches [R. Hobson, et\nal., Phys. Rev. A 93, 010501(R) (2016); T. Zanon-Willette, et al., Phys. Rev. A\n93, 042506 (2016)] consist in much greater efficiency and resistibility in the\npresence of decoherentization.\n", "  The Hubble Space Telescope has imaged the central part of M87 over a 10 week\nspan, leading to the discovery of 32 classical novae and nine fainter, likely\nvery slow and/or symbiotic novae. In this first in a series of papers we\npresent the M87 nova finder charts, and the light and color curves of the\nnovae. We demonstrate that the rise and decline times, and the colors of M87\nnovae are uncorrelated with each other and with position in the galaxy. The\nspatial distribution of the M87 novae follows the light of the galaxy,\nsuggesting that novae accreted by M87 during cannibalistic episodes are\nwell-mixed. Conservatively using only the 32 brightest classical novae we\nderive a nova rate for M87: $363_{-45}^{+33}$ novae/yr. We also derive the\nluminosity-specific classical nova rate for this galaxy, which is\n$7.88_{-2.6}^{+2.3} /yr/ 10^{10}L_\\odot,_{K}$. Both rates are 3-4 times higher\nhigher than those reported for M87 in the past, and similarly higher than those\nreported for all other galaxies. We suggest that most previous ground-based\nsurveys for novae in external galaxies, including M87, miss most faint, fast\nnovae, and almost all slow novae near the centers of galaxies.\n", "  There are different functional regions in cities such as tourist attractions,\nshopping centers, workplaces and residential places. The human mobility\npatterns for different functional regions are different, e.g., people usually\ngo to work during daytime on weekdays, and visit shopping centers after work.\nIn this paper, we analyse urban human mobility patterns and infer the functions\nof the regions in three cities. The analysis is based on three large taxi GPS\ndatasets in Rome, San Francisco and Beijing containing 21 million, 11 million\nand 17 million GPS points respectively. We categorized the city regions into\nfour kinds of places, workplaces, entertainment places, residential places and\nother places. First, we provide a new quad-tree region division method based on\nthe taxi visits. Second, we use the association rule to infer the functional\nregions in these three cities according to temporal human mobility patterns.\nThird, we show that these identified functional regions can help us deliver\ndata in network applications, such as urban Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs),\nmore efficiently. The new functional-regions-based DTNs algorithm achieves up\nto 183% improvement in terms of delivery ratio.\n", "  We study the 4-d holomorphic Spin Foam amplitude on arbitrary connected\n2-complexes and degrees of divergence. With recently developed tools and\ntruncation scheme, we derive a formula for a certain class of graphs, which\nallows us to write down the value of bulk amplitudes simply based on graph\nproperties. We then generalize the result to arbitrary connected 2-complexes\nand extract a simple expression for the degree of divergence only in terms of\ncombinatorial properties and topological invariants. The distinct behaviors of\nthe model in different regions of parameter space signal phase transitions. In\nthe regime which is of physical interest for recovering diffeomorphsim symmetry\nin the continuum limit, the most divergent configurations are melonic graphs.\nWe end with a discussion of physical implications.\n", "  The scaling of disk galaxy rotation velocity with baryonic mass (the\n\"Baryonic Tully-Fisher\" relation, BTF) has long confounded galaxy formation\nmodels. It is steeper than the M ~ V^3 scaling relating halo virial masses and\ncircular velocities and its zero point implies that galaxies comprise a very\nsmall fraction of available baryons. Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may\nin principle be explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness\nof the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter expected from such\nvigorous feedback mechanism. We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that\nthe BTF relation is well reproduced in LCDM simulations that match the size and\nnumber of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy\nrotation velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the steep\nvelocity-mass dependence results from the decline in galaxy formation\nefficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to reconcile the CDM halo mass\nfunction with the galaxy luminosity function. Despite the strong feedback, the\nscatter in the simulated BTF is smaller than observed, even when considering\nall simulated galaxies and not just rotationally-supported ones. The\nsimulations predict that the BTF should become increasingly steep at the faint\nend, although the velocity scatter at fixed mass should remain small. Observed\ngalaxies with rotation speeds below ~40 km/s seem to deviate from this\nprediction. We discuss observational biases and modeling uncertainties that may\nhelp to explain this disagreement in the context of LCDM models of dwarf galaxy\nformation.\n", "  The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR) is a valuable observational tool\nand a critical test of galaxy formation theory. We explore the systematic\nuncertainty in the slope and the scatter of the observed line width BTFR\nutilizing homogeneously measured, unresolved HI observations for 930 isolated\ngalaxies. We measure a fiducial relation of $\\log_{10}{M_{\\rm baryon}} =\n3.24\\log_{10}{V_{\\rm rot}}+3.21$ with observed scatter of 0.25 dex with\n$10^{7.4} < M_{\\rm baryon} < 10^{11.3}M_{\\odot}$ where $V_{\\rm rot}$ is\nmeasured from 20\\% HI line widths. We vary the definitions of $M_{\\rm baryon}$\nand $V_{\\rm rot}$, the sample selection, and the linear fitting algorithm. We\nobtain slopes ranging from 2.64 to 3.53 and scatter measurements ranging from\n0.14 to 0.41~dex, indicating a systematic uncertainty of 0.25 in the BTFR slope\nderived from unresolved HI line widths. We compare our fiducial slope to\nliterature measurements, where reported slopes range from 3.0 to 4.3 and\nscatter is either unmeasured, immeasurable or as large as 0.4~dex. Measurements\nderived from unresolved HI line widths tend to produce slopes of 3.3, while\nmeasurements derived from asymptotic rotation curves tend to produce slopes of\n3.9. The largest factor affecting the BTFR slope is the definition of $V_{\\rm\nrot}$. The sample definition, the mass range, and the linear fitting algorithm\nalso significantly affect the measured BTFR. We find that galaxies in our\nsample with $V_{\\rm rot} < 100~\\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ are consistent with the line\nwidth BTFR of more massive galaxies, but these galaxies drive most of the\nobserved scatter. It is critical when comparing predictions to an observed BTFR\nthat the $V_{\\rm rot}$ definition, the sample selection and the fitting\nalgorithm are similarly defined. We recommend direct statistical comparisons\nbetween data sets with commensurable properties as opposed to comparing BTFR\npower-law fits.\n", "  Anti-de Sitter (AdS) is conjectured to be nonlinear unstable to a weakly\nturbulent mechanism that develops a cascade towards high frequencies, leading\nto black hole formation [1,2]. We give evidence that the gravitational sector\nof perturbations behaves differently from the scalar one studied in [2]. In\ncontrast with [2], we find that not all gravitational normal modes of AdS can\nbe nonlinearly extended into periodic horizonless smooth solutions of the\nEinstein equation. In particular, we show that even seeds with a single normal\nmode can develop secular resonances, unlike the spherically symmetric scalar\nfield collapse studied in [2]. Moreover, if the seed has two normal modes, more\nthan one resonance can be generated at third order, unlike the spherical\ncollapse of [2]. We also show that weak turbulent perturbative theory predicts\nthe existence of direct and inverse cascades, with the former dominating the\nlatter for equal energy two-mode seeds.\n", "  Employing a combination of many-body configuration interaction method\ndescribed by extended Hubbard model along with first principle calculations we\npredict the emergence of high oscillator strength at near-IR region which\noriginates from the Davydov type of splitting in doped graphene quantum dots\n(GQD). Incorporation of strain in GQD promotes closely spaced bright states\ninciting for coherent excitation. Controlling the destructive interference of\nthe functionalized nano graphene quantum states, the dark states can be tuned\ntowards red end ensuing the system as a good candidate for photocell whereas\ncoherent states can be tailored to concentrate the light at very high intensity\nresulting an opportunity for photonic device\n", "  We review the method NAV (New Algol Variable) first introduced in\n2012Ap.....55..536A, which uses the locally-dependent shapes of eclipses in an\naddition to the trigonometric polynomial of the second order (which typically\ndescribes the \"out-of-eclipse\" part of the light curve with effects of\nreflection, ellipticity and O'Connell). Eclipsing binary stars are believed to\nshow distinct eclipses only if belonging to the EA type. With a decreasing\neclipse width, the statistically optimal value of the trigonometric polynomial\ns (2003ASPC..292..391A) drastically increases from ~2 for elliptic (EL)\nvariables without eclipses, ~6-8 for EW and up to ~30-50 for some EA with\nnarrow eclipses. In this case of large number of parameters, the smoothing\ncurve becomes very noisy and apparent waves (the Gibbs phenomenon) may be seen.\nThe NAV set of the parameters may be used for classification in the GCVS, VSX\nand similar catalogs. The maximal number of parameters is m=12, which\ncorresponds to s=5, if correcting both the period and the initial epoch. We\nhave applied the method to few stars, also in a case of multi-color photometry\n(2015JASS...32..127A), when it is possible to use the phenomenological\nparameters from the NAV fit to estimate physical parameters using statistical\ndependencies. We conclude that the NAV approximation is better than the TP one\neven for the case of EW-type stars with much wider eclipses. It may also be\nused to determine timings (see 2005ASPC..335...37A for a review of methods) or\nto determine parameters in the case of variable period, using a complete light\ncurve modeling the phase variations. The method is illustrated on 2MASS\nJ11080447-6143290 (EA-type), USNO-B1.0 1265-0306001 and USNO-B1.0 1266-0313413\n(EW-type) and compared to various other methods from the literature.\n", "  We demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, that it is possible to\ngenerate two photons from one and only one photon. We characterize the output\ntwo photon field and make our calculations close to reality by including\nlosses. Our proposal relies on real or artificial three-level atoms with a\ncyclic transition strongly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. We show that\nclose to perfect downconversion with efficiency over 99% is reachable using\nstate-of-the-art Waveguide QED architectures such as photonic crystals or\nsuperconducting circuits. In particular, we sketch an implementation in circuit\nQED, where the three level atom is a transmon.\n", "  The popular, stable, robust and computationally inexpensive cubic spline\ninterpolation algorithm is adopted and used for finite temperature Green's\nfunction calculations of realistic systems. We demonstrate that with\nappropriate modifications the temperature dependence can be preserved while the\nGreen's function grid size can be reduced by about two orders of magnitude by\nreplacing the standard Matsubara frequency grid with a sparser grid and a set\nof interpolation coefficients. We benchmarked the accuracy of our algorithm as\na function of a single parameter sensitive to the shape of the Green's\nfunction. Through numerous examples, we confirmed that our algorithm can be\nutilized in a systematically improvable, controlled, and black-box manner and\nhighly accurate one- and two-body energies and one-particle density matrices\ncan be obtained using only around 5% of the original grid points. Additionally,\nwe established that to improve accuracy by an order of magnitude, the number of\ngrid points needs to be doubled, whereas for the Matsubara frequency grid an\norder of magnitude more grid points must be used. This suggests that realistic\ncalculations with large basis sets that were previously out of reach because\nthey required enormous grid sizes may now become feasible.\n", "  Dense cold atomic clouds have been shown to be similar to plasmas. Previous\nstudies showed that such clouds exhibit instabilities induced by long-range\ninteractions. However they did not describe the spatial properties of the\ndynamics. In this Letter, we study experimentally the spatial nature of\nstochastic instabilities and find out that the dynamics is localized. Data are\nanalyzed both in the spectral domain and in the spatial domain (principal\ncomponent analysis). Both methods fail to describe the dynamics in terms of\neigenmodes, showing that space and time are not separable.\n", "  We use time-domain electromagnetic simulations to determine the spectral\ncharacteristics of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) antenna.\nThese simulations are part of a multi-faceted campaign to determine the\neffectiveness of the dish's design for obtaining a detection of redshifted 21\ncm emission from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations show the existence\nof reflections between HERA's suspended feed and its parabolic dish reflector\nthat fall below -40 dB at 150 ns and, for reasonable impedance matches, have a\nnegligible impact on HERA's ability to constrain EoR parameters. It follows\nthat despite the reflections they introduce, dishes are effective for\nincreasing the sensitivity of EoR experiments at relatively low cost. We find\nthat electromagnetic resonances in the HERA feed's cylindrical skirt, which is\nintended to reduce cross coupling and beam ellipticity, introduces significant\npower at large delays ($-40$ dB at 200 ns) which can lead to some loss of\nmeasurable Fourier modes and a modest reduction in sensitivity. Even in the\npresence of this structure, we find that the spectral response of the antenna\nis sufficiently smooth for delay filtering to contain foreground emission at\nline-of-sight wave numbers below $k_\\parallel \\lesssim 0.2$ $h$Mpc$^{-1}$, in\nthe region where the current PAPER experiment operates. Incorporating these\nresults into a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that the spectral structure\nobserved in our simulations has only a small effect on the tight constraints\nHERA can achieve on parameters associated with the astrophysics of\nreionization.\n", "  Phenomenological nonequilibrium thermodynamics describes how fluxes of\nconserved quantities such as matter, energy and charge flow from outer\nreservoirs across a system, and how they irreversibly degrade from one form to\nanother. Stochastic thermodynamics is formulated in terms of probability fluxes\ncirculating in the system's configuration space. The consistency of the two\nframeworks is granted by the condition of local detailed balance, which\nspecifies the amount of physical quantities exchanged with the reservoirs\nduring single transitions between configurations. We demonstrate that the\ntopology of the configuration space crucially determines the number of\nindependent thermodynamic affinities (forces) that the reservoirs generate\nacross the system, and provide a general algorithm that produces the\nfundamental affinities and their conjugate currents contributing to the total\ndissipation, based on the interplay between macroscopic conservations laws for\nthe currents and microscopic symmetries of the affinities.\n", "  I investigate the volume corrections on cumulants of total charge\ndistributions and net proton distributions. The required volume information is\ngenerated by an optical Glauber model. I find that the corrected statistical\nexpectations of multiplicity distributions mimic the negative binomial\ndistributions at non-central collisions, and they tend to approach the Poisson\nones at most-central collisions due to the \"boundary effects,\" which suppress\nthe volume corrections. However, net proton distributions and reference\nmultiplicity distributions are sensitive to the external volume fluctuations at\nmost-central collisions, which imply that one has to consider the details of\nvolume distributions in event-by-event multiplicity fluctuation studies.\n", "  We extend to three dimensions the Concentric Maclaurin Spheroid method for\nobtaining the self-consistent shape and gravitational field of a rotating\nliquid planet, to include a tidal potential from a satellite. We exhibit, for\nthe first time, the important effect of the planetary rotation rate on tidal\nresponse of gas giants. Simulations of planets with fast rotation rates like\nthose of Jupiter and Saturn, exhibit significant changes in calculated tidal\nlove numbers $k_{nm}$ when compared with non-rotating bodies. A test model of\nSaturn fitted to observed zonal gravitational multipole harmonics yields\n$k_2=0.413$, consistent with a recent observational determination from Cassini\nastrometry data (Lainey et al., 2016). The calculated love number is robust\nunder reasonable assumptions of interior rotation rate, satellite parameters,\nand details of Saturn's interior structure. The method is benchmarked against\nseveral published test cases.\n", "  We develop a finite-temperature hydrodynamic approach for a harmonically\ntrapped one-dimensional quasicondensate and apply it to describe the phenomenon\nof frequency doubling in the breathing-mode oscillations of its momentum\ndistribution. The doubling here refers to the oscillation frequency relative to\nthe oscillations of the real-space density distribution, invoked by a sudden\nconfinement quench. We find that the frequency doubling is governed by the\nquench strength and the initial temperature, rather than by the crossover from\nthe ideal Bose gas to the quasicondensate regime. The hydrodynamic predictions\nare supported by the results of numerical simulations based on a\nfinite-temperature c-field approach, and extend the utility of the hydrodynamic\ntheory for low-dimensional quantum gases to the description of\nfinite-temperature systems and their dynamics in momentum space.\n", "  This paper is concerned with a filtering problem for a class of nonlinear\nquantum stochastic systems with multichannel nondemolition measurements. The\nsystem-observation dynamics are governed by a Markovian Hudson-Parthasarathy\nquantum stochastic differential equation driven by quantum Wiener processes of\nbosonic fields in vacuum state. The Hamiltonian and system-field coupling\noperators, as functions of the system variables, are represented in a Weyl\nquantization form. Using the Wigner-Moyal phase-space framework, we obtain a\nstochastic integro-differential equation for the posterior quasi-characteristic\nfunction (QCF) of the system conditioned on the measurements. This equation is\na spatial Fourier domain representation of the Belavkin-Kushner-Stratonovich\nstochastic master equation driven by the innovation process associated with the\nmeasurements. We also discuss a more specific form of the posterior QCF\ndynamics in the case of linear system-field coupling and outline a Gaussian\napproximation of the posterior quantum state.\n", "  Populations of oscillators can display a variety of synchronization patterns\ndepending on the oscillators' intrinsic coupling and the coupling between them.\nWe consider two coupled, symmetric (sub)populations with unimodal frequency\ndistributions and show that the resulting synchronization patterns may resemble\nthose of a single population with bimodally distributed frequencies. Our proof\nof the equivalence of their stability, dynamics, and bifurcations, is based on\nan Ott-Antonsen ansatz. The generalization to networks consisting of multiple\n(sub)populations vis-\\`a-vis networks with multimodal frequency distributions,\nhowever, appears impossible.\n", "  The classification of materials into insulators and conductors has been\nshaken up by the discovery of topological insulators that conduct robustly at\nthe edge but not in the bulk. In mechanics, designating a material as\ninsulating or conducting amounts to asking if it is rigid or floppy. Although\nmechanical structures that display topological floppy modes have been proposed,\nthey are all vulnerable to global collapse. Here, we design and build\nmechanical metamaterials that are stable and yet capable of harboring protected\nedge and bulk modes, analogous to those in electronic topological insulators\nand Weyl semimetals. To do so, we exploit gear assemblies that, unlike point\nmasses connected by springs, incorporate both translational and rotational\ndegrees of freedom. Global structural stability is achieved by eliminating\ngeometrical frustration of collective gear rotations extending through the\nassembly. The topological robustness of the mechanical modes makes them\nappealing across scales from engineered macrostructures to networks of toothed\nmicrorotors of potential use in micro-machines.\n", "  We present a strong and weak gravitational lens model of the galaxy cluster\nMACSJ0416.1-2403, constrained using spectroscopy from the Grism Lens-Amplified\nSurvey from Space (GLASS) and Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) imaging data. We\nsearch for emission lines in known multiply imaged sources in the GLASS\nspectra, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts of 31 multiple images\nbelonging to 16 distinct source galaxies. The GLASS spectra provide the first\nspectroscopic measurements for 6 of the source galaxies. The weak lensing\nsignal is acquired from 884 galaxies in the F606W HFF image. By combining the\nweak lensing constraints with 15 multiple image systems with spectroscopic\nredshifts and 9 multiple image systems with photometric redshifts, we\nreconstruct the gravitational potential of the cluster on an adaptive grid. The\nresulting total mass density map is compared with a stellar mass density map\nobtained from the deep Spitzer Frontier Fields imaging data to study the\nrelative distribution of stellar and total mass in the cluster. We find that\nthe projected stellar mass to total mass ratio, $f_{\\star}$, varies\nconsiderably with the stellar surface mass density. The mean projected stellar\nmass to total mass ratio is $\\langle f_{\\star} \\rangle= 0.009 \\pm 0.003 $\n(stat.), but with a systematic error as large as $0.004-0.005$, dominated by\nthe choice of the IMF. We find agreement with several recent measurements of\n$f_{\\star}$ in massive cluster environments. The lensing maps of convergence,\nshear, and magnification are made available to the broader community in the\nstandard HFF format.\n", "  An accretion outburst onto a neutron star deposits hydrogen-rich and/or\nhelium-rich material into the neutron star's envelope. Thermonuclear burning of\naccreted material robustly produces Urca pairs\\textrm{---}pairs of nuclei that\nundergo cycles of $e^-$-capture and $\\beta ^-$-decay. The strong $T^5$\ndependence of the Urca cooling neutrino luminosity means that Urca pairs in the\nneutron star interior potentially remove heat from accretion-driven nuclear\nreactions. In this study, we identify Urca pairs in the neutron star's ocean\n\\textrm{---} a plasma of ions and electrons overlaying the neutron star crust\n\\textrm{---} and demonstrate that Urca cooling occurs at all depths in the\nocean. We find that Urca pairs in the ocean and crust lower the ocean's\nsteady-state temperature during an accretion outburst and that unstable carbon\nignition, which is thought to trigger superbursts, occurs deeper than it would\notherwise. Cooling superburst light curves, however, are only marginally\nimpacted by cooling from Urca pairs because the superburst peak radiative\nluminosity $L_{\\rm peak}$ is always much greater than the Urca pair neutrino\nluminosity $L_{\\nu}$ in the hot post-superburst ocean.\n", "  We study the two dimensional massless Coulomb-Dirac operator restricted to\nits positive spectral subspace and prove estimates on the negative eigenvalues\ncreated by electromagnetic perturbations.\n", "  We present Chandra ACIS-S sub-array observations of the quiescent neutron\nstar low-mass X-ray binaries X7 and X5 in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. The\nlarge reduction in photon pile-up compared to previous deep exposures enables a\nsubstantial improvement in the spectroscopic determination of the neutron star\nradius and mass of these neutron stars. Modeling the thermal emission from the\nneutron star surface with a non-magnetized hydrogen atmosphere and accounting\nfor numerous sources of uncertainties, we obtain for the neutron star in X7 a\nradius of $R=11.1^{+0.8}_{-0.7}$ km for an assumed stellar mass of $M=1.4$\nM$_{\\odot}$ (68% C.L.). We argue, based on astrophysical grounds, that the\npresence of a He atmosphere is unlikely for this source. Due to eclipses and\nvariable absorption, the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary X5 provides less\nstringent constraints, leading to a radius of $R=9.6^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ km,\nassuming a hydrogen atmosphere and a mass of $M=1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$. When combined\nwith all other existing spectroscopic radius measurements, these measurements\nstrongly favor radii in the 9.9-11.2 km range for a ~1.5 M$_{\\odot}$ neutron\nstar and point to a dense matter equation of state that is somewhat softer than\nthe nucleonic ones that are consistent with laboratory experiments at low\ndensities.\n", "  Interfacial spin-flip scattering plays an important role in magnetoelectronic\ndevices. Spin loss at metallic interfaces is usually quantified by matching the\nmagnetoresistance data for multilayers to the Valet-Fert model, while treating\neach interface as a fictitious bulk layer whose thickness is $\\delta$ times the\nspin-diffusion length. By employing the properly generalized circuit theory and\nthe scattering matrix approaches, we derive the relation of the parameter\n$\\delta$ to the spin-flip transmission and reflection probabilities at an\nindividual interface. It is found that $\\delta$ is proportional to the square\nroot of the probability of spin-flip scattering. We calculate the spin-flip\ntransmission probability for flat and rough Cu/Pd interfaces using the\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker method based on the first-principles electronic structure\nand find $\\delta$ in reasonable agreement with experiment.\n", "  The lifting of $d_{xz}$-$d_{yz}$ orbital degeneracy is often considered a\nhallmark of the nematic phase of Fe-based superconductors, including FeSe, but\nits origin is not yet understood. Here we report a high resolution\nAngle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy study of single crystals of FeSe,\naccounting for the photon-energy dependence and making a detailed analysis of\nthe temperature dependence. We find that the hole pocket undergoes a\nfourfold-symmetry-breaking distortion in the nematic phase below 90~K, but in\ncontrast the changes to the electron pockets do not require fourfold\nsymmetry-breaking. Instead, there is an additional separation of the existing\n$d_{xy}$ and $d_{xz/yz}$ bands - which themselves are not split within\nresolution. These observations lead us to propose a new scenario of\n\"unidirectional nematic bond ordering\" to describe the low-temperature\nelectronic structure of FeSe, supported by a good agreement with 10-orbital\ntight binding model calculations.\n", "  We present a new extension of the weak lensing formalism capable of\ndescribing strongly lensed images. This paper accompanies Paper I,\narXiv:1603.04698 where we provided a condensed overview of the approach and\nillustrated how it works. Here we give all the necessary details, together with\nsome more explicit examples. We solve the non-linear geodesic deviation\nequation order-by-order, keeping the leading derivatives of the optical tidal\nmatrix, giving rise to a series of maps from which a complete strongly lensed\nimage is formed. The family of maps are decomposed by separating the trace and\ntrace-free parts of each map. Each trace-free tensor represents an independent\nspin mode, which distort circles into a variety of roulettes in the\nscreen-space. It is shown how summing this series expansion allows us to create\nlarge strongly lensed images in regions where convergence, shear and flexion\nare not sufficient. This paper is a detailed exposition of Paper I which\npresents the key elements of the subject matter in a wider context.\n", "  We detect in real time inter-dot tunneling events in a weakly coupled two\nelectron double quantum dot in GaAs. At finite magnetic fields, we observe two\ncharacteristic tunneling times, T_d and T_b, belonging to, respectively, a\ndirect and a blocked (spin-flip-assisted) tunneling. The latter corresponds to\nlifting of a Pauli spin blockade and the tunneling times ratio eta=T_b/T_d\ncharacterizes the blockade efficiency. We find pronounced changes in the\nbehavior of eta upon increasing the magnetic field, with eta increasing,\nsaturating and increasing again. We explain this behavior as due to the\ncrossover of the dominant blockade lifting mechanism from the hyperfine to\nspin-orbit interactions and due to a change in the contribution of the charge\ndecoherence.\n", "  We announce the discovery of the transiting hot Jupiter WASP-157b in a 3.95-d\norbit around a V = 12.9 G2 main-sequence star. This moderately inflated planet\nhas a Saturn-like density with a mass of $0.57 \\pm 0.10$ M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and a\nradius of $1.06 \\pm 0.05$ R$_{\\rm Jup}$. We do not detect any rotational or\nphase-curve modulations, nor the secondary eclipse, with conservative\nsemi-amplitude upper limits of 250 and 20 ppm, respectively.\n", "  Sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets represent one of the most common types of\nplanets in the Milky Way, yet many of their properties are unknown. Here, we\npresent a prescription to adapt the capabilities of the stellar evolution\ntoolkit Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to model\nsub-Neptune mass planets with H/He envelopes. With the addition of routines\ntreating the planet core luminosity, heavy element enrichment, atmospheric\nboundary condition, and mass loss due to hydrodynamic winds, the evolutionary\npathways of planets with diverse starting conditions are more accurately\nconstrained. Using these dynamical models, we construct mass-composition\nrelationships of planets from 1 to 400 $M_{\\oplus}$ and investigate how\nmass-loss impacts their composition and evolution history. We demonstrate that\nplanet radii are typically insensitive to the evolution pathway that brought\nthe planet to its instantaneous mass, composition and age, with variations from\nhysteresis. We find that planet envelope mass loss timescales, $\\tau_{\\rm\nenv}$, vary non-monotonically with H/He envelope mass fractions (at fixed\nplanet mass). In our simulations of young (100~Myr) low-mass\n($M_p\\lesssim10~M_\\oplus$) planets with rocky cores, $\\tau_{\\rm env}$ is\nmaximized at $M_{\\rm env}/M_p=1\\%$ to $3\\%$. The resulting convergent mass loss\nevolution could potentially imprint itself on the close-in planet population as\na preferred H/He mass fraction of ${\\sim}1\\%$. Looking ahead, we anticipate\nthat this numerical code will see widespread applications complementing both\n3-D models and observational exoplanet surveys.\n", "  The typical optical-UV continuum slopes observed in many type 1 AGN are\nredder than expected from thin accretion disk models. A possible resolution to\nthis conundrum is that many AGN are reddened by dust along the line of sight.\nTo explore this possibility, we stack 5000 SDSS AGN with luminosity\nL~10^45erg/s and redshift z~0.4 in bins of optical continuum slope alpha_opt\nand width of the broad H$\\beta$ emission line. We measure the EW of the NaID\nabsorption feature in each stacked spectrum. We find a linear relation between\nalpha_opt and EW(NaID), such that EW(NaID) increases as alpha_opt becomes\nredder. In the bin with the smallest H$\\beta$ width, objects with the bluest\nslopes that are similar to accretion disk predictions are found to have\nEW(NaID)=0, supporting the line-of-sight dust hypothesis. This conclusion is\nalso supported by the dependence of the $H\\alpha/H\\beta$ line ratio on\nalpha_opt. The implied relationship between alpha_opt and dust reddening is\ngiven by E(B-V)~0.2(-0.1-alpha_opt), and the implied reddening of a typical\ntype 1 AGN with alpha_opt=-0.5 is E(B-V)~0.08mag. Photoionization calculations\nshow that the dusty gas responsible for reddening is too ionized to produce the\nobserved features. Therefore, we argue that the sodium absorption arises in\nregions of the host ISM which are shielded from the AGN radiation, and the\ncorrelation with alpha_opt arises since ISM columns along shielded and\nnon-shielded sightlines are correlated. This scenario is supported by the\nsimilarity of the E(B-V)-NaID relation implied by our results with the relation\nin the Milky-Way found by previous studies.\n", "  An understanding of the post-impact dynamics of ejecta clouds are crucial to\nthe planning of a kinetic impact mission to an asteroid, and also has great\nimplications for the history of planetary formation. The purpose of this\narticle to track the evolution of ejecta produced by AIDA mission, which\ntargets for kinetic impact the secondary of near-Earth binary asteroid 65803\nDidymos on 2022, and to feedback essential informations to AIDA's ongoing\nphase-A study. We present a detailed dynamic model for the simulation of an\nejecta cloud from a binary asteroid that synthesizes all relevant forces based\non a previous analysis of the mechanical environment. We apply our method to\ngain insight into the expected response of Didymos to the AIDA impact,\nincluding the subsequent evolution of debris and dust. The crater scaling\nrelations from laboratory experiments are employed to approximate the\ndistributions of ejecta mass and launching speed. The size composition of\nfragments is modeled with a power law fitted from observations of real asteroid\nsurface. A full-scale demonstration is simulated using parameters specified by\nthe mission. We report the results of the simulation, which include the\ncomputed spread of the ejecta cloud and the recorded history of ejecta\naccretion and escape. The violent period of the ejecta evolution is found to be\nshort, and is followed by a stage where the remaining ejecta is gradually\ncleared. Solar radiation pressure proves to be efficient in cleaning dust-size\nejecta, and the simulation results after two weeks shows that large debris on\npolar orbits (perpendicular to the binary orbital plane) has a survival\nadvantage over smaller ejecta and ejecta that keep to low latitudes.\n", "  Quantum walks (QWs) describe particles evolving coherently on a lattice. The\ninternal degree of freedom corresponds to a Hilbert space, called coin system.\nWe consider QWs on Cayley graphs of some group $G$. In the literature,\ninvestigations concerning infinite $G$ have been focused on graphs\ncorresponding to $G=\\mathbb{Z}^d$ with coin system of dimension 2, whereas for\none-dimensional coin (so called scalar QWs) only the case of finite $G$ has\nbeen studied. Here we prove that the evolution of a scalar QW with $G$ infinite\nAbelian is trivial, providing a thorough classification of this kind of walks.\nThen we consider the infinite dihedral group $D_\\infty$, that is the unique\nnon-Abelian group $G$ containing a subgroup $H\\cong\\mathbb{Z}$ with two cosets.\nWe characterize the class of QWs on the Cayley graphs of $D_\\infty$ and, via a\ncoarse-graining technique, we show that it coincides with the class of\nspinorial walks on $\\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfies parity symmetry. This class of\nQWs includes the Weyl and the Dirac QWs. Remarkably, there exist also spinorial\nwalks that are not coarse-graining of a scalar QW, such as the Hadamard walk.\n", "  General covariance is the cornerstone of Einstein's General Relativity (GR)\nand implies that any two metrics related by diffeomorphisms are physically\nequivalent. There are, however, many examples pointing to the fact that this\nstrict statement of general covariance needs refinement. There are a very\nspecial (measure-zero) subset of diffeomorphisms, the residual diffeomrphisms,\nto which one can associate well-defined conserved charges. This would hence\nrender these diffeomorphic geometries physically distinct. We discuss that\nthese symmetries may be appropriately called \"symplectic symmetries\". Existence\nof residual diffeomorphisms and sympelctic symmetries can be a quite general\nfeature and not limited to the examples discussed so far in the literature. We\npropose that, in the context of black holes, these diffeomorphic, but distinct,\ngeometries may be viewed as \"symplectic soft hair\" on black holes. We comment\non how this may remedy black hole microstate problem, which in this context are\ndubbed as \"horizon fluffs\".\n", "  We investigate the role of excited states in High-order Harmonic Generation\nby studying the spectral, spatial and temporal characteristics of the radiation\nproduced near the ionization threshold of argon by few-cycle laser pulses. We\nshow that the population of excited states can lead either to direct XUV\nemission through Free Induction Decay or to the generation of high-order\nharmonics through ionization from these states and recombination to the ground\nstate. By using the attosecond lighthouse technique, we demonstrate that the\nhigh-harmonic emission from excited states is temporally delayed by a few\nfemtoseconds compared to the usual harmonics, leading to a strong nonadiabatic\nspectral redshift.\n", "  A new generation of cryogenic light detectors exploiting Neganov-Luke effect\nto enhance the thermal signal has been used to detect the Cherenkov light\nemitted by the electrons interacting in TeO$_{2}$ crystals. With this mechanism\na high significance event-by-event discrimination between alpha and beta/gamma\ninteractions at the $^{130}$Te neutrino-less double beta decay Q-value -\n(2527.515 $\\pm$ 0.013) keV - has been demonstrated. This measurement opens the\npossibility of drastically reducing the background in cryogenic experiments\nbased on TeO$_{2}$.\n", "  We revisit Weyl's metrication (geometrization) of electromagnetism. We show\nthat by making Weyl's proposed geometric connection be pure imaginary, not only\nare we able to metricate electromagnetism, an underlying local conformal\ninvariance makes the geometry be strictly Riemannian and prevents observational\ngravity from being complex. Via torsion we achieve an analogous metrication for\naxial-vector fields. We generalize our procedure to Yang-Mills theories, and\nachieve a metrication of all the fundamental forces. Only in the gravity sector\ndoes our approach differ from the standard picture of fundamental forces, with\nour approach requiring that standard Einstein gravity be replaced by conformal\ngravity. We show that quantum conformal gravity is a consistent and unitary\nquantum gravitational theory, one that, unlike string theory, only requires\nfour spacetime dimensions.\n", "  Bayesian graphical models are an efficient tool for modelling complex data\nand derive self-consistent expressions of the posterior distribution of model\nparameters. We apply Bayesian graphs to perform statistical analyses of Type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) luminosity distance measurements from the joint light-curve\nanalysis (JLA) data set. In contrast to the $\\chi^2$ approach used in previous\nstudies, the Bayesian inference allows us to fully account for the\nstandard-candle parameter dependence of the data covariance matrix. Comparing\nwith $\\chi^2$ analysis results, we find a systematic offset of the marginal\nmodel parameter bounds. We demonstrate that the bias is statistically\nsignificant in the case of the SN Ia standardization parameters with a maximal\n6 $\\sigma$ shift of the SN light-curve colour correction. In addition, we find\nthat the evidence for a host galaxy correction is now only 2.4 $\\sigma$.\nSystematic offsets on the cosmological parameters remain small, but may\nincrease by combining constraints from complementary cosmological probes. The\nbias of the $\\chi^2$ analysis is due to neglecting the parameter-dependent\nlog-determinant of the data covariance, which gives more statistical weight to\nlarger values of the standardization parameters. We find a similar effect on\ncompressed distance modulus data. To this end, we implement a fully consistent\ncompression method of the JLA data set that uses a Gaussian approximation of\nthe posterior distribution for fast generation of compressed data. Overall, the\nresults of our analysis emphasize the need for a fully consistent Bayesian\nstatistical approach in the analysis of future large SN Ia data sets.\n", "  We present a new DNS data set for a statistically axisymmetric turbulent jet,\nplume and forced plume in a domain of size $40 r_0 \\times 40 r_0 \\times 60\nr_0$, where $r_0$ is the source diameter. The data set provides evidence of the\nvalidity of the Priestley and Ball entrainment model in unstratified\nenvironments (excluding the region near the source), which is corroborated\nfurther by the Wang and Law and Ezzamel \\emph{et al.} experimental data sets,\nthe latter being corrected for a small but influential co-flow that affected\nthe statistics. We show that the turbulence in the core region of the jet and\nthe plume are practically indistinguishable, although the invariants of the\nanisotropy tensor reveal a significant change in the turbulence near the plume\nedge. The DNS data indicates that the turbulent Prandtl number is about 0.7 for\nboth jets and plumes. For plumes, this value is a result of the difference in\nthe ratio of the radial turbulent transport of radial momentum and buoyancy.\nFor jets however, the value originates from a different spread of the buoyancy\nand velocity profiles, in spite of the fact that the ratio of radial turbulent\ntransport terms is approximately unity. The DNS data does not show any evidence\nof similarity drift associated with gradual variations in the ratio of buoyancy\nprofile to velocity profile widths.\n", "  We present new wind models for {\\tau} Bo\\\"otis ({\\tau} Boo), a\nhot-Jupiter-host-star whose observable magnetic cycles makes it a uniquely\nuseful target for our goal of monitoring the temporal variability of stellar\nwinds and their exoplanetary impacts. Using spectropolarimetric observations\nfrom May 2009 to January 2015, the most extensive information of this type yet\navailable, to reconstruct the stellar magnetic field, we produce multiple 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic stellar wind models. Our results show that characteristic\nchanges in the large-scale magnetic field as the star undergoes magnetic cycles\nproduce changes in the wind properties, both globally and locally at the\nposition of the orbiting planet. Whilst the mass loss rate of the star varies\nby only a minimal amount ($\\sim$ 4 percent), the rates of angular momentum loss\nand associated spin-down timescales are seen to vary widely (up to $\\sim$ 140\npercent), findings consistent with and extending previous research. In\naddition, we find that temporal variation in the global wind is governed mainly\nby changes in total magnetic flux rather than changes in wind plasma\nproperties. The magnetic pressure varies with time and location and dominates\nthe stellar wind pressure at the planetary orbit. By assuming a Jovian\nplanetary magnetic field for {\\tau} Boo b, we nevertheless conclude that the\nplanetary magnetosphere can remain stable in size for all observed stellar\ncycle epochs, despite significant changes in the stellar field and the\nresulting local space weather environment.\n", "  Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are among the most luminous dusty galaxies in\nthe Universe, but their true nature remains unclear; are SMGs the progenitors\nof the massive elliptical galaxies we see in the local Universe, or are they\njust a short-lived phase among more typical star-forming galaxies? To explore\nthis problem further, we investigate the clustering of SMGs identified in the\nSCUBA-2 Cosmology Legacy Survey. We use a catalogue of submillimetre\n($850\\mu$m) source identifications derived using a combination of radio\ncounterparts and colour/IR selection to analyse a sample of 914 SMGs in the\nUKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), making this the largest high redshift sample of\nthese galaxies to date. Using angular cross-correlation techniques, we estimate\nthe halo masses for this large sample of SMGs and compare them with passive and\nstar-forming galaxies selected in the same field. We find that SMGs, on\naverage, occupy high-mass dark matter halos (M$_{\\text{halo}}\n>10^{13}$M$_{\\odot}$) at redshifts $z > 2.5$, consistent with being the\nprogenitors of massive quiescent galaxies in present-day galaxy clusters. We\nalso find evidence of downsizing, in which SMG activity shifts to lower mass\nhalos at lower redshifts. In terms of their clustering and halo masses, SMGs\nappear to be consistent with other star-forming galaxies at a given redshift.\n", "  We show that the closed-loop control obtained by feeding back the derivative\nof the signal from the homodyne measurement of one mode of the light exiting a\ntwo-mode optical cavity interacting with a mechanical resonator permits to\ncontrol and increase optical output entanglement. In particular, the proposed\nfeedback-enhanced setup allows to achieve a fidelity of coherent state\nteleportation greater than the threshold value of 2/3 for secure teleportation,\nand two-way steering between the two cavity's output modes down the line in\npresence of loss, which otherwise would not be possible without feedback\n", "  We propose a new method of constraining the redshifts of individual\nextragalactic sources based on celestial coordinates and their ensemble\nstatistics. Techniques from integer linear programming are utilized to optimize\nsimultaneously for the angular two-point cross- and autocorrelation functions.\nOur novel formalism introduced here not only transforms the otherwise\nhopelessly expensive, brute-force combinatorial search into a linear system\nwith integer constraints but also is readily implementable in off-the-shelf\nsolvers. We adopt Gurobi, a commercial optimization solver, and use Python to\nbuild the cost function dynamically. The preliminary results on simulated data\nshow potential for future applications to sky surveys by complementing and\nenhancing photometric redshift estimators. Our approach is the first\napplication of integer linear programming to astronomical analysis.\n", "  We address the question of the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild black hole by\nconsidering the following question: How many meaningful solutions of the\nEinstein equations exist that agree with the Schwarzschild solution (with a\nfixed mass m) everywhere except maybe on a codimension one hypersurface? The\nperhaps surprising answer is that the solution is unique (and uniquely the\nSchwarzschild solution everywhere in spacetime) *unless* the hypersurface is\nthe event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole, in which case there are\nactually an infinite number of distinct solutions. We explain this result and\ncomment on some of the possible implications for black hole physics.\n", "  Direct numerical solution of the coordinate-space integral-equation version\nof the two-particle Lippmann Schwinger (LS) equation is considered as a means\nof avoiding the shortcomings of partial-wave expansion at high energies and in\nthe context of few-body problems. Upon the regularization of the singular\nkernel of the three-dimensional LS equation by a subtraction technique, a\nthree-variate quadrature rule is used to solve the resulting nonsingular\nintegral equation. To avoid the computational burden of discretizing three\nvariables, advantage is taken of the fact that, for central potentials,\nazimuthal angle can be integrated out leaving a two-variable reduced integral\nequation. Although the singularity in the the kernel of the two-variable\nintegral equation is weaker than that of the three-dimensional equation, it\nnevertheless requires careful handling for quadrature discretization to be\napplicable. A regularization method for the kernel of the two-variable integral\nequation is derived from the treatment of the singularity in the\nthree-dimensional equation. A quadrature rule constructed as the direct-product\nof single-variable quadrature rules for radial distance and polar angle is used\nto discretize the two-variable integral equation. These two- and three-variable\nmethods are tested on a model nucleon-nucleon potential. The results show that\nNystrom method for the coordinate-space LS equation compares favorably in terms\nof its ease of implementation and effectiveness with the Nystrom method for the\nmomentum-space version of the LS equation .\n", "  We introduce a new type of gamma-ray spectral feature, which we denominate\ngamma-ray triangle. This spectral feature arises in scenarios where dark matter\nself-annihilates via a chiral interaction into two Dirac fermions, which\nsubsequently decay in flight into another fermion and a photon. The resulting\nphoton spectrum resembles a sharp triangle and can be readily searched for in\nthe gamma-ray sky. Using data from the Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. instruments, we\nfind no evidence for such spectral feature and therefore set strong upper\nbounds on the corresponding annihilation cross section. A concrete realization\nof a scenario yielding gamma-ray triangles consists of an asymmetric dark\nmatter model where the dark matter particle carries lepton number. We show\nexplicitly that this class of models can lead to intense gamma-ray spectral\nfeatures, potentially at the reach of upcoming gamma-ray telescopes, opening a\nnew window to explore asymmetric dark matter through indirect searches.\n", "  A phenomenologically viable theory of quantum gravity must accommodate all\nobserved matter degrees of freedom and their properties. Here, we explore\nwhether a toy model of the Higgs-Yukawa sector of the Standard Model is\ncompatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity. We discuss the\nphenomenological implications of our result in the context of the Standard\nModel. We analyze the quantum scaling dimension of the system, and find an\nirrelevant Yukawa coupling at a joint gravity-matter fixed point. Further, we\nexplore the impact of gravity-induced couplings between scalars and fermions,\nwhich are non-vanishing in asymptotically safe gravity.\n", "  We determine the anomalous dimensions of baryon operators for the three color\ntheory as function of the number of massless flavours within the conformal\nwindow to the maximum known order in perturbation theory. We show that the\nanomalous dimension of the baryon is controllably small, within the\n$\\delta$-expansion, for a wide range of number of flavours. We also find that\nthis is always smaller than the anomalous dimension of the fermion mass\noperator. These findings challenge the partial compositeness paradigm.\n", "  Due to the axioms of quantum mechanics, perfect cloning of an unknown quantum\nstate is impossible. But since imperfect cloning is still possible, a question\narises: \"Is there an optimal quantum cloning machine?\" Buzek and Hillery answer\nto this question and construct their famous B-H quantum cloning machine. The\nB-H machine clones state of an arbitrary single qubit in optimal manner and\nhence it is universal. Generalizing this machine for two-qubit system is\nstraightforward, but this procedure does not preserve quantum correlation\nexisting in bipartite state in optimal manner and also, during this procedure,\nthis machine loses its universality and becomes a state-dependent cloning\nmachine. In this paper we propose an optimal universal local quantum state\ncloner for two qubit systems. Also we present two classes of state-dependent\nlocal quantum copying machine. Furthermore, we investigate local broadcasting\nof two aspects of quantum correlations, i.e., quantum entanglement and quantum\ndiscord defined, respectively, within the entanglement-separability paradigm\nand from an information-theoretic perspective. The results show that although\nquantum correlation is in general very fragile during broadcasting procedure,\nquantum discord is broadcasted more robustly than quantum entanglement.\n", "  Host galaxy identification is a crucial step for modern supernova (SN)\nsurveys such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Large Synoptic Survey\nTelescope (LSST), which will discover SNe by the thousands. Spectroscopic\nresources are limited, so in the absence of real-time SN spectra these surveys\nmust rely on host galaxy spectra to obtain accurate redshifts for the Hubble\ndiagram and to improve photometric classification of SNe. In addition, SN\nluminosities are known to correlate with host-galaxy properties. Therefore,\nreliable identification of host galaxies is essential for cosmology and SN\nscience. We simulate SN events and their locations within their host galaxies\nto develop and test methods for matching SNe to their hosts. We use both real\nand simulated galaxy catalog data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys General\nCatalog and MICECATv2.0, respectively. We also incorporate \"hostless\" SNe\nresiding in undetected faint hosts into our analysis, with an assumed hostless\nrate of 5%. Our fully automated algorithm is run on catalog data and matches\nSNe to their hosts with 91% accuracy. We find that including a machine learning\ncomponent, run after the initial matching algorithm, improves the accuracy\n(purity) of the matching to 97% with a 2% cost in efficiency (true positive\nrate). Although the exact results are dependent on the details of the survey\nand the galaxy catalogs used, the method of identifying host galaxies we\noutline here can be applied to any transient survey.\n", "  The self-organization of turbulence into regular zonal flows can be\nfruitfully investigated with quasilinear methods and statistical descriptions.\nA wave kinetic equation that assumes asymptotically large-scale zonal flows is\npathological. From an exact description of quasilinear dynamics emerges two\nbetter geometrical optics approximations. These involve not only the mean flow\nshear but also the second and third derivative of the mean flow. One\napproximation takes the form of a new wave kinetic equation, but is only valid\nwhen the zonal flow is quasi-static and wave action is conserved.\n", "  We study embeddings of the unit sphere of complex Hilbert spaces of dimension\na power $2^n$ into the corresponding groups of non-singular linear\ntransformations. For the case of $n=1$, the sphere $S_2$ of qubits is\nidentified with $\\mbox{SU}(2)$ and the algebraic structure of this last group\nis carried into $S_2$. Hence it is natural to analyse whether is it possible,\nfor $n\\geq 2$, to carry the structure of the symmetry group $\\mbox{SU}(2^n)$\ninto the unit sphere $S_{2^n}$. For $n=2$ the embeddings of $S_{2^2}$ into\n$\\mbox{GL}(2^2)$, obtained as tensor products of the above embedding, fails to\ndetermine a bijection between $S_{2^2}$ and $\\mbox{SU}(2^2)$, but they\ndetermine entanglement measures consistent with von Neumann entropy.\n", "  We explore a model based on the classically-scale invariant standard model\n(SM) with a strongly coupled vector-like dynamics, which is called hypercolor\n(HC). The scale symmetry is dynamically broken by the vector-like condensation\nat the TeV scale, so that the SM Higgs acquires the negative mass-squared by\nthe bosonic seesaw mechanism to realize the electroweak symmetry breaking. An\nelementary pseudoscalar $S$ is introduced to give masses for the composite\nNambu-Goldstone bosons (HC pions): the HC pion can be a good target to explore\nthrough a diphoton channel at the LHC. As the consequence of the bosonic\nseesaw, the fluctuating mode of $S$, which we call $s$, develops tiny couplings\nto the SM particles and is predicted to be very light. The $s$ predominantly\ndecays to diphoton and can behave as an invisible axion-like dark matter. The\nmass of the $s$-dark matter is constrained by currently available cosmological\nand astrophysical limits to be $10^{-4} {\\rm eV} \\lesssim m_s \\lesssim 1 \\,{\\rm\neV}$. We find that the sufficient amount of relic abundance for the $s$-dark\nmatter can be accumulated via the coherent oscillation. The detection potential\nin microwave cavity experiments is also addressed.\n", "  Extended dynamical mean-field theory (EDMFT) is insufficient to describe\nnon-local effects in strongly correlated systems, since corrections to the\nmean-field solution are generally large. We present an efficient scheme for the\nconstruction of diagrammatic extensions of EDMFT that avoids usual double\ncounting problem by using an exact change of variables (the dual boson\nformalism) to distinguish the correlations included in the mean-field solution\nand those beyond. With a computational efficiency comparable to EDMFT+GW\napproach, our scheme significantly improves on the charge order transition\nphase boundary in the extended Hubbard model.\n", "  It has recently been established that two-dimensional massless graphene-like\nsystems and three-dimensional line-node topological semimetals comprise a\nspecial class of centrosymmetric materials where edge/surface states of\ntopological nature inevitably appear in some k-regions. We show that the phases\nof solid hydrogen produced at megabar pressures can be line-node topological\nsemimetals. In such phases, the material exhibits topological surface states\nand therefore can be a poor bulk metal but good surface conductor. The results\nmay help to explain discrepant high-pressure experimental data reported for\ndense hydrogen as well as provide predictions for future measurements,\nincluding possible surface superconductivity in hydrogen. Related topological\nbehavior may be expected in high-pressure phases formed in other elements\nincluding simple metals.\n", "  Nonperturbative coupling of light with condensed matter in an optical cavity\nis expected to reveal a host of coherent many-body phenomena and states. In\naddition, strong coherent light-matter interaction in a solid-state environment\nis of great interest to emerging quantum-based technologies. However, creating\na system that combines a long electronic coherence time, a large dipole moment,\nand a high cavity quality ($Q$) factor has been a challenging goal. Here, we\nreport collective ultrastrong light-matter coupling in an ultrahigh-mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron gas in a high-$Q$ terahertz photonic-crystal cavity in\na quantizing magnetic field, demonstrating a cooperativity of $\\sim$360. The\nsplitting of cyclotron resonance (CR) into the lower and upper polariton\nbranches exhibited a $\\sqrt{n_\\mathrm{e}}$-dependence on the electron density\n($n_\\mathrm{e}$), a hallmark of collective vacuum Rabi splitting. Furthermore,\na small but definite blue shift was observed for the polariton frequencies due\nto the normally negligible $A^2$ term in the light-matter interaction\nHamiltonian. Finally, the high-$Q$ cavity suppressed the superradiant decay of\ncoherent CR, which resulted in an unprecedentedly narrow intrinsic CR linewidth\nof 5.6 GHz at 2 K. These results open up a variety of new possibilities to\ncombine the traditional disciplines of many-body condensed matter physics and\ncavity-based quantum optics.\n", "  We introduce a classification scheme for symmetry protected topological\nphases applicable to stationary states of open systems based on a\ngeneralization of the many-body polarization. The polarization can be used to\nprobe the topological properties of non-interacting and interacting closed and\nopen systems as well and remains a meaningful quantity even in the presence of\nmoderate particle-number fluctuations. As examples, we discuss two open-system\nversions of a topological Thouless pump in the steady state of one-dimensional\nlattices driven by Markovian reservoirs. In the analogous unitary system, the\nRice-Mele model, symmetries enforce topological properties which lead to a\nnon-trivial winding of the geometric Zak phase upon cyclic variations of model\nparameters. Associated with this is a winding of the many-body polarization,\ncorresponding to a quantized transport in the bulk (Thouless pump). We here\nshow that in the open system, where the Zak phase looses its meaning, the same\nsymmetries enforce a winding of the generalized many- body polarization. This\nwinding is shown to be robust against Hamiltonian perturbations as well as\nhomogeneous dephasing and particle losses..\n", "  We study the dynamics of a starving random walk in general spatial dimension\n$d$. This model represents an idealized description for the fate of an unaware\nforager whose motion is not affected by the presence or absence of resources.\nThe forager depletes its environment by consuming resources and dies if it\nwanders too long without finding food. In the exactly-solvable case of one\ndimension, we explicitly derive the average lifetime of the walk and the\ndistribution for the number of distinct sites visited by the walk at the\ninstant of starvation. We also give a heuristic derivation for the averages of\nthese two quantities. We tackle the complex but ecologically-relevant case of\ntwo dimensions by an approximation in which the depleted zone is assumed to\nalways be circular and which grows incrementally each time the walk reaches the\nedge of this zone. Within this framework, we derive a lower bound for the\nscaling of the average lifetime and number of distinct sites visited at\nstarvation. We also determine the asymptotic distribution of the number of\ndistinct sites visited at starvation. Finally, we solve the case of high\nspatial dimensions within a mean-field approach.\n", "  We investigate the quantum melting of one dimensional crystals that are\nrealized in an atomic lattice in which ground state atoms are laser excited to\ntwo Rydberg states. We focus on a regime where both, intra- and inter-state\ndensity-density interactions as well as coherent exchange interactions\ncontribute. We determine stable crystalline phases in the classical limit and\nexplore their melting under quantum fluctuations introduced by the excitation\nlaser as well as two-body exchange. We find that within a specific parameter\nrange quantum fluctuations introduced by the laser can give rise to a devil's\nstaircase structure which one might associate with transitions in the classical\nlimit. The melting through exchange interactions is shown to also proceed in a\nstep-like fashion, in case of small crystals, due to the proliferation of\nRydberg spinwaves.\n", "  The dynamics of many-body systems spanning condensed matter, cosmology, and\nbeyond is hypothesized to be universal when the systems cross continuous phase\ntransitions. The universal dynamics is expected to satisfy a scaling symmetry\nof space and time with the crossing rate, inspired by the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism. We test this symmetry based on Bose condensates in a shaken optical\nlattice. Shaking the lattice drives condensates across an effectively\nferromagnetic quantum phase transition. After crossing the critical point, the\ncondensates manifest delayed growth of spin fluctuations and develop\nanti-ferromagnetic spatial correlations resulting from sub-Poisson generation\nof topological defects. The characteristic times and lengths scale as\npower-laws of the crossing rate, yielding the temporal exponent 0.50(2) and the\nspatial exponent 0.26(2), consistent with theory. Furthermore, the fluctuations\nand correlations are invariant in scaled space-time coordinates, in support of\nthe scaling symmetry of quantum critical dynamics.\n", "  We provide a non-linear realisation of composite Higgs models in the context\nof the SU(4)/Sp(4) symmetry breaking pattern, where the effective Lagrangian of\nthe spin-0 and spin-1 resonances is constructed via the CCWZ prescription using\nthe Hidden Symmetry formalism. We investigate the EWPT constraints by\naccounting the effects from reduced Higgs couplings and integrating out heavy\nspin-1 resonances. This theory emerges from an underlying theory of gauge\ninteractions with fermions, thus first principle lattice results predict the\nmassive spectrum in composite Higgs models. This model can be used as a\ntemplate for the phenomenology of composite Higgs models at the LHC and at\nfuture 100 TeV colliders, as well as for other application. In this work, we\nfocus on the formalism for spin-1 resonances and their bounds from di-lepton\nand di-boson searches at the LHC.\n", "  Direct Ly $\\alpha$ imaging of intergalactic gas at $z\\sim2$ has recently\nrevealed giant cosmological structures around quasars, e.g. the Slug Nebula\n(Cantalupo et al. 2014). Despite their high luminosity, the detection rate of\nsuch systems in narrow-band and spectroscopic surveys is less than 10%,\npossibly encoding crucial information on the distribution of gas around quasars\nand the quasar emission properties. In this study, we use the MUSE\nintegral-field instrument to perform a blind survey for giant Ly $\\alpha$\nnebulae around 17 bright radio-quiet quasars at $3<z<4$ that does not suffer\nfrom most of the limitations of previous surveys. After data reduction and\nanalysis performed with specifically developed tools, we found that each quasar\nis surrounded by giant Ly $\\alpha$ nebulae with projected sizes larger than 100\nphysical kpc and, in some cases, extending up to 320 kpc. The circularly\naveraged surface brightness profiles of the nebulae appear very similar to each\nother despite their different morphologies and are consistent with power laws\nwith slopes $\\approx-1.8$. The similarity between the properties of all these\nnebulae and the Slug Nebula suggests a similar origin for all systems and that\na large fraction of gas around bright quasars could be in a relatively \"cold\"\n(T$\\sim$10$^4$K) and dense phase. In addition, our results imply that such gas\nis ubiquitous within at least 50 kpc from bright quasars at $3<z<4$\nindependently of the quasar emission opening angle, or extending up to 200 kpc\nfor quasar isotropic emission.\n", "  In the present paper, we have considered the three parameters: mass, charge\nand rotation to discuss their combined effect on frame dragging for a charged\nrotating body. If we consider the ray of light which is emitted radially\noutward from a rotating body then the frame dragging shows a periodic nature\nwith respect to coordinate $\\phi$ (azimuthal angle). It has been found that the\nvalue of frame dragging obtains a maximum at, $ \\phi =\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and a\nminimum at $ \\phi =\\frac{3 \\pi}{2}$.\n", "  The radiative torque (RAT) alignment of interstellar grains with ordinary\nparamagnetic susceptibilities has been supported by earlier studies. The\nalignment of such grains depends on the so-called RAT parameter $q^{\\max}$ that\nis determined by the grain shape. In this paper, we elaborate our model of RAT\nalignment for grains with enhanced magnetic susceptibility due to iron\ninclusions, such that RAT alignment is magnetically enhanced for which we term\nMRAT mechanism. Such grains can get aligned with high angular momentum at the\nso-called high-J attractor points, achieving a high degree of alignment. Using\nour analytical model of RATs we derive the critical value of the magnetic\nrelaxation parameter $\\delta_{m}$ to produce high-J attractor points as\nfunctions of $q^{\\max}$ and the anisotropic radiation angle relative to the\nmagnetic field $\\psi$. We find that if about $10\\%$ of total iron abundance\npresent in silicate grains are forming iron clusters, it is sufficient to\nproduce high-J attractor points for all reasonable values of $q^{\\max}$. To\ncalculate the degree of grain alignment, we carry out numerical simulations of\nMRAT alignment by including stochastic excitations from gas collisions and\nmagnetic fluctuations. We show that large grains can achieve perfect alignment\nwhen the high-J attractor point is present, regardless of the values of\n$q^{\\max}$. Our obtained results pave the way for physical modeling of\npolarized thermal dust emission as well as magnetic dipole emission. We also\nfind that millimeter-sized grains in accretion disks may be aligned with the\nmagnetic field if they are incorporated with iron nanoparticles.\n", "  Angular resolved measurements of the exchange bias field and the coercive\nfield are a powerful tool to distinguish between different competing magnetic\nanisotropies in polycrystalline exchange bias layer systems. No simple\nanalytical model is as yet available, which considers time dependent effects\nlike enhanced coercivity arising from the grain size distribution of the\nantiferromagnet. In this work we expand an existing model class describing\npolycrystalline exchange bias systems by a rotatable magnetic anisotropy term\nto describe grain size correlated effects. Additionally, we performed angular\nresolved magnetization curve measurements using vectorial magnetooptic Kerr\nmagnetometry. Comparison of the experimental data with the proposed model shows\nexcellent agreement and reveals the ferromagnetic anisotropy and properties\nconnected to the grain size distribution of the antiferromagnet. Therefore, a\ndistinction between the different influences on coercivity and anisotropy\nbecomes available.\n", "  We have carried out a detailed study to understand the observed energy\nspectrum and composition of cosmic rays with energies up to ~10^18 eV. Our\nstudy shows that a single Galactic component with subsequent energy cut-offs in\nthe individual spectra of different elements, optimised to explain the observed\nspectra below ~10^14 eV and the knee in the all-particle spectrum, cannot\nexplain the observed all-particle spectrum above ~2x10^16 eV. We discuss two\napproaches for a second component of Galactic cosmic rays -- re-acceleration at\na Galactic wind termination shock, and supernova explosions of Wolf-Rayet\nstars, and show that the latter scenario can explain almost all observed\nfeatures in the all-particle spectrum and the composition up to ~10^18 eV, when\ncombined with a canonical extra-galactic spectrum expected from strong radio\ngalaxies or a source population with similar cosmological evolution. In this\ntwo-component Galactic model, the knee at ~ 3x10^15 eV and the second knee at\n~10^17 eV in the all-particle spectrum are due to the cut-offs in the first and\nsecond components, respectively. We also discuss several variations of the\nextra-galactic component, from a minimal contribution to scenarios with a\nsignificant component below the ankle (at ~4x10^18 eV), and find that\nextra-galactic contributions in excess of regular source evolution are neither\nindicated nor in conflict with the existing data. Our main result is that the\nsecond Galactic component predicts a composition of Galactic cosmic rays at and\nabove the second knee that largely consists of helium or a mixture of helium\nand CNO nuclei, with a weak or essentially vanishing iron fraction, in contrast\nto most common assumptions. This prediction is in agreement with new\nmeasurements from LOFAR and the Pierre Auger Observatory which indicate a\nstrong light component and a rather low iron fraction between ~10^17 and 10^18\neV.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that proximity-induced superconductivity in\nsilicene offers the possibility to exert strong quantum ground state control.\nWe show that electrically controlled $0$-$\\pi$ transitions occur in Josephson\njunctions in the presence of an exchange field due to the buckling of the\nsilicene lattice. We also discover that zigzag-oriented interfaces, featuring\nintervalley scattering, cause a $\\varphi_0$ state with an applied electric\nfield. Finally, we demonstrate that Majorana bound states along the silicene\nedge are tunable via the edge orientation, electric, and in-plane spin exchange\nfields.\n", "  Quantum squeezing and entanglement of spins can be used to improve the\nsensitivity in quantum metrology. Here we propose a scheme to create collective\ncoupling of an ensemble of spins to mechanical vibrational mode actuated by an\nexternal magnetic field. We find an evolution time where the mechanical motion\ndecouples from the spins, and the accumulated geometric phase yields a\nsqueezing of $5.9~\\text{dB}$ for $20$ spins. We also show the creation of a\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger spin state for $20$ spins with a fidelity of $\\sim\n0.62$ at cryogenic temperature. The numerical simulations show that the\ngeometric-phase based scheme is mostly immune to thermal mechanical noise.\n", "  The chiral and deconfinement phase transitions are investigated within the\nvariational Hamiltonian approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge. The temperature\n$\\beta^{- 1}$ is introduced by compactifying a spatial dimension. Thereby the\nwhole temperature dependence is encoded in the vacuum state on the spatial\nmanifold $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times S^1 (\\beta)$. The chiral quark condensate and the\ndual quark condensate (dressed Polyakov loop) are calculated as function of the\ntemperature. From their inflection points the pseudo-critical temperatures for\nthe chiral and deconfinement crossover transitions are determined. Using the\nzero-temperature quark and gluon propagators obtained within the variational\napproach as input, we find $168 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$ and $196 \\, \\mathrm{MeV}$,\nrespectively, for the chiral and deconfinement transition.\n", "  We present a new method for interferometric imaging that is ideal for the\nlarge fields of view and compact arrays common in 21 cm cosmology. We first\ndemonstrate the method with simulations for two very different low frequency\ninterferometers, the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) and the MIT Epoch of\nReionization (MITEoR) Experiment. We then apply the method to the MITEoR data\nset collected in July 2013 to obtain the first northern sky map from 128 MHz to\n175 MHz at about 2 degree resolution, and find an overall spectral index of\n-2.73+/-0.11. The success of this imaging method bodes well for upcoming\ncompact redundant low-frequency arrays such as HERA. Both the MITEoR\ninterferometric data and the 150 MHz sky map are publicly available at\nhttp://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/omniscope.html.\n", "  We consider Bayesian estimate of static magnetic field, characterized by a\nprior Gaussian probability distribution, in systems of a few electron quantum\ndot spins interacting with infinite temperature spin environment via hyperfine\ninteraction. Sudden transitions among optimal states and measurements are\nobserved. Usefulness of measuring occupation levels is shown for all times of\nthe evolution, together with the role of entanglement in the optimal scenario.\nFor low values of magnetic field, memory effects stemming from the interaction\nwith environment provide limited metrological advantage.\n", "  We present magnetometry and muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR) measurements of the\nsuperconducting dichalcogenide Ir$_{0.95}$Pt$_{0.05}$Te$_2$. From both sets of\nmeasurements we calculate the penetration depth and thence superfluid density\nas a function of temperature. The temperature dependence of the superfluid\ndensities from both sets of data indicate fully gapped superconductivity that\ncan be fit to a conventional s-wave model and yiel fitting parameters\nconsistent with a BCS weak coupling superconductor. We therefore see no\nevidence for exotic superconductivity in Ir$_{0.95}$Pt$_{0.05}$Te$_2$.\n", "  We propose a theoretical approach based on an interferometer composed by two\nquantum dots asymmetrically coupled to isolated Majorana quasiparticles (MQPs),\nlying on the edges of two topological Kitaev chains, respectively via couplings\n$(t+\\Delta)$ and $(\\Delta-t)$. This setup enables us to probe MQPs in a quite\ndistinct way from the zero-bias peak feature. Most importantly, the system\nbehaves as a current switch made by two distinct paths: (i) for the upper dot\nconnected to both chains, the device perceives both MQPs as an ordinary fermion\nand the current crosses solely the lower dot, since current in the upper dot is\nprevented due to the presence of the superconducting gap; and (ii) by\nsuppressing slightly the hybridization of the upper dot with one chain, the\ncurrent is abruptly switched to flow through this dot, once a trapped electron\nas a bound state in the continuum (BIC) (Phys. Rev. B 93, 165116 (2016))\nappears in the lower dot. Such a current switch between upper and lower dots\ncharacterizes the Quantum Phase Transition (QPT) proposed here, being the ratio\n$t/\\Delta$ the control parameter of the transition. This QPT is associated with\na change from an ordinary fermionic excitation regime to a MQP in the\ninterferometer, which enables not only the fundamental revealing of MQPs, but\nalso yields a current switch assisted by them.\n", "  The experimental existence and stability of the quantum criticality point of\nthe two-channel Kondo (2CK) effect displaying exotic non-Fermi liquid physics\nhas been buried in persistent confusion despite the intensive theoretical and\nexperimental efforts in past three decades. Here we report an experimental\nrealization of the two-level system scattering-induced orbital 2CK effect in a\nferromagnetic L10-MnGa film, which is signified by a magnetic field-independent\nresistivity upturn that has a logarithmic and square-root temperature\ndependence beyond and below the Kondo temperature of ~14.5 K, respectively. Our\nresult not only evidences the robust existence of orbital 2CK effect even in\nthe presence of strong magnetic fields and long-range ferromagnetic ordering\nbut also extends the scope of 2CK host materials from nonmagnetic nanoscale\npoint contacts to diffusive conductors of disordered alloys.\n", "  We consider Parker particle production in the Ekpyrotic scenario (in\nparticular in the New Ekpyrotic model) and show that the density of particles\nproduced by the end of the phase of Ekpyrotic contraction is sufficient to lead\nto a hot state of matter after the bounce. Hence, no separate reheating\nmechanism is necessary.\n", "  Using a bottom up phenomenological approach we constructed a simple doubly\ncharged vector lepton $E^{\\pm\\pm}$ model for the possible 750 GeV diphoton\nresonance $\\Phi$ at the LHC assuming it to be a scalar particle. Since no\nstable doubly charged leptons are seen, to facilitate their decays we complete\nthe model by adding a charged SM electroweak scalar $S^\\pm$. $\\Phi$ is a SM\nsinglet and can be either an inert scalar or a Higgs field. In the inert case\nmore than one vector lepton are required to account for the photon fusion\nproduction of the resonance if the model is to remain perturbative. For a\nHiggssed case $S^\\pm$ can assist the production mechanism without using more\nthan one such lepton. We also found that precision measurements constrain the\ncouplings of $E^{\\pm\\pm}$ and $S^\\pm$ to SM particles to be small. This raises\nthe possibility that they can be fairly long lived and can give rise to\ndisplaced vertices if produced at the LHC.\n", "  More than three decades ago quadratic gravity was found to present a\nperturbative, renormalizable and asymptotically free theory of quantum gravity.\nUnfortunately the theory appeared to have problems with a spin-2 ghost. In this\nessay we revisit quadratic gravity in a different light by considering the case\nthat the asymptotically free interaction flows to a strongly interacting\nregime. This occurs when the coefficient of the Einstein-Hilbert term is\nsmaller than the scale $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{QG}}$ where the quadratic couplings\ngrow strong. Here QCD provides some useful insights. By pushing the analogy\nwith QCD, we conjecture that the nonperturbative effects can remove the naive\nspin-2 ghost and lead to the emergence of general relativity in the IR.\n", "  We argue in this essay that for classical configurations of gravity in the\nAdS/CFT setup, it is in general impossible to reconstruct the bulk geometry\nfrom the leading asymptotic behavior of the classical fields in gravity alone.\nThis is possible sufficiently near the vacuum, but not more generally. We argue\nthis by using a counter-example that utilizes the supersymmetric geometries\nconstructed by Lin, Lunin, and Maldacena. In the dual quantum field theory, the\nadditional data required to complete the geometry is encoded in modes that near\nthe vacuum geometry lie beyond the Planck scale.\n", "  Common features of known quantum gravity theories may hint at the general\nnature of quantum gravity. The absence of continuous global symmetries is one\nsuch feature. This inspired the Weak Gravity Conjecture, which bounds masses of\ncharged particles. We propose the Lattice Weak Gravity Conjecture, which\nfurther requires the existence of an infinite tower of particles of all\npossible charges under both abelian and nonabelian gauge groups and directly\nimplies a cutoff for quantum field theory. It holds in a wide variety of string\ntheory examples and has testable consequences for the real world and for pure\nmathematics. We sketch some implications of these ideas for models of\ninflation, for the QCD axion (and LIGO), for conformal field theory, and for\nalgebraic geometry.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the low-temperature heat capacity and\nthermal expansion of single crystals of the hole-doped Ba1-xKxFe2As2 series\n(0<x<1) and the end-members RbFe2As2 and CsFe2As2. A large increase of the\nSommerfeld coefficient is observed with both decreasing band filling and\nisovalent substitution (K, Rb, Cs) revealing a strong enhancement of electron\ncorrelations and the possible proximity of these materials to a Mott insulator.\nThis trend is well reproduced theoretically by our Density-Functional Theory +\nSlave-Spin (DFT+SS) calculations, confirming that 122-iron pnictides are\neffectively Hund metals, in which sizable Hund's coupling and orbital\nselectivity are the key ingredients for tuning correlations. We also find\ndirect evidence for the existence of a coherence-incoherence crossover between\na low-temperature heavy Fermi liquid and a highly incoherent high-temperature\nregime similar to heavy fermion systems. In the superconducting state, clear\nsignatures of multiband superconductivity are observed with no evidence for\nnodes in the energy gaps, ruling out the existence of a doping-induced change\nof symmetry (from s to d-wave). We argue that the disappearance of the electron\nband in the range 0.4<x<1.0 is accompanied by a strong-to-weak coupling\ncrossover and that this shallow band remains involved in the superconducting\npairing, although its contribution to the normal state fades away. Differences\nbetween hole- and electron-doped BaFe2As2 series are emphasized and discussed\nin terms of strong pair breaking by potential scatterers beyond the Born limit.\n", "  Hints from a number of different approaches to quantum gravity point to a\nphenomenon of \"spontaneous dimensional reduction\" to two spacetime dimensions\nnear the Planck scale. I examine the physical meaning of the term \"dimension\"\nin this context, summarize the evidence for dimensional reduction, and discuss\npossible physical explanations.\n", "  Most of the main planetary satellites of our Solar System are expected to be\nin synchronous rotation, the departures from the strict synchronicity being a\nsignature of the interior. Librations have been measured for the Moon, Phobos,\nand some satellites of Saturn. I here revisit the theory of the longitudinal\nlibrations in considering that part of the interior is not hydrostatic, i.e.\nhas not been shaped by the rotational and tidal deformations, but is fossil.\nThis consideration affects the rotational behavior. For that, I derive the\ntensor of inertia of the satellite in splitting these two parts, before\nproposing an analytical solution that I validate with numerical simulations. I\napply this new theory on Mimas and Epimetheus, for which librations have been\nmeasured from Cassini data. I show that the large measured libration amplitude\nof these bodies can be explained by an excess of triaxiality that would not\nresult from the hydrostatic theory. This theory cannot explain the phase shift\nwhich has been measured in the diurnal librations of Mimas. This speaks against\na solid structure for Mimas, i.e. Mimas could have a global internal ocean.\n", "  One of the most promising frameworks for understanding the anomalies of cold\nand especially supercooled water is that of two-structure thermodynamics, in\nwhich water is viewed as a non-ideal mixture of two interconvertible local\nstructures. The non-ideality of this mixture may give rise, at very low\ntemperatures, to a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a liquid-liquid\ncritical point (LLCP), at which thermodynamic response functions diverge.\nVarious versions of the \"two-structure equation of state\" (TSEOS) based on this\nconcept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data in real\nwater and simulation results. However, recent experiments probing supercooled\nwater at negative pressures reveal the inadequacy of extrapolations of\nequations of state developed for positive pressures, and have begun to shed\nadditional light on the source of the anomalies of supercooled water. We have\nanalyzed simulation results for the TIP4P/2005 model over a broad range of\npositive and negative pressures from ambient temperature to deep supercooling.\nWe find that by explicitly incorporating a liquid-vapor spinodal into a\ntwo-structure equation of state, we are able to match the simulation data in\nTIP4P/2005 with striking accuracy. In particular, our equation of state\nreproduces the observed lines of minima and maxima in the density, isothermal\ncompressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. Contrary to scenarios in which a\nretracing spinodal accounts for the thermodynamic anomalies of water, we find\nthat the liquid-vapor spinodal in this model continues monotonically to lower\npressures as temperature is decreased, influencing but not giving rise to the\nlocus of density maxima and other thermodynamic anomalies. We explain the\nbehavior of TIP4P/2005 in terms of two phenomena: the competition between two\nlocal structures and a monotonic liquid-vapor spinodal.\n", "  Quantum non-local correlations and the acausal, spooky action at a distance\nsuggest a discord between quantum theory and special relativity. We propose a\nresolution for this discord by first observing that there is a problem of time\nin quantum theory. There should exist a reformulation of quantum theory which\ndoes not refer to classical time. Such a reformulation is obtained by\nsuggesting that space-time is fundamentally non-commutative. Quantum theory\nwithout classical time is the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of the\nunderlying non-commutative relativity. Stochastic fluctuations about\nequilibrium give rise to the classical limit and ordinary space-time geometry.\nHowever, measurement on an entangled state can be correctly described only in\nthe underlying non-commutative space-time, where there is no causality\nviolation, nor a spooky action at a distance.\n", "  We study the mutual percolation of two interdependent lattice networks\nranging from two to seven dimensions, denoted as $D$. We impose that the length\nof interdependent links connecting nodes in the two lattices be less than or\nequal to a certain value, $r$. For each value of $D$ and $r$, we find the\nmutual percolation threshold, $p_c[D,r]$ below which the system completely\ncollapses through a cascade of failures following an initial destruction of a\nfraction $ (1-p)$ of the nodes in one of the lattices. We find that for each\ndimension, $D<6$, there is a value of $r=r_I>1$ such that for $r\\geq r_I$ the\ncascading failures occur as a discontinuous first order transition, while for\n$r<r_I$ the system undergoes a continuous second order transition, as in the\nclassical percolation theory. Remarkably, for $D=6$, $r_I=1$ which is the same\nas in random regular (RR) graphs with the same degree (coordination number) of\nnodes. We also find that in all dimensions, the interdependent lattices reach\nmaximal vulnerability (maximal $p_c[D,r]$) at a distance $r=r_{max}>r_I$, and\nfor $r>r_{max}$ the vulnerability starts to decrease as $r\\to\\infty$. However\nthe decrease becomes less significant as $D$ increases and\n$p_c[D,r_{max}]-p_c[D,\\infty]$ decreases exponentially with $D$. We also\ninvestigate the dependence of $p_c[D,r]$ on the system size as well as how the\nnature of the transition changes as the number of lattice sites, $N\\to\\infty$.\n", "  We present updated constraints on dark matter models with momentum-dependent\nor velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei, based on direct detection and\nsolar physics. We improve our previous treatment of energy transport in the\nsolar interior by dark matter scattering, leading to significant changes in\nfits to many observables. Based on solar physics alone, DM with a\nspin-independent $q^{4}$ coupling provides the best fit to data, and a\nstatistically satisfactory solution to the solar abundance problem. Once direct\ndetection limits are accounted for however, the best solution is spin-dependent\n$v^2$ scattering with a reference cross-section of 10$^{-35}$ cm$^2$ (at a\nreference velocity of $v_0=220$ km s$^{-1}$), and a dark matter mass of about 5\nGeV.\n", "  The intrinsic escape fraction of ionizing Lyman continuum photons ($f_{esc}$)\nis crucial to understand whether galaxies are capable of reionizing the neutral\nhydrogen in the early universe at z>6. Unfortunately, it is not possible to\naccess $f_{esc}$ at z>4 with direct observations and the handful of\nmeasurements from low redshift galaxies consistently find $f_{esc}$ < 10%,\nwhile at least $f_{esc}$ ~ 10% is necessary for galaxies dominate reionization.\nHere, we present the first empirical prediction of $f_{esc}$ at z>6 by\ncombining the (sparsely populated) relation between [OIII]/[OII] and $f_{esc}$\nwith the redshift evolution of [OIII]/[OII] as predicted from local high-z\nanalogs selected by their H$\\alpha$ equivalent-width. We find $f_{esc}$ =\n$5.7_{-3.3}^{+8.3}$% at z=6 and $f_{esc}$ = $10.4_{-6.3}^{+15.5}$% at z=9 for\ngalaxies with log(M/M$_{sun}$) ~ 9.0 (errors given as 1$\\sigma$). However,\nthere is a negative correlation with stellar mass and we find up to 50% larger\n$f_{esc}$ per 0.5 dex decrease in stellar mass. The population averaged escape\nfraction increases according to $f_{esc}$ = $f_{esc,0} ((1+z)/3)^a$, with\n$f_{esc,0} = 2.3 \\pm 0.05$% and $a=1.17 \\pm 0.02$ at z > 2 for log(M/M$_{sun}$)\n~ 9.0. With our empirical prediction of $f_{esc}$ (thus fixing an important\npreviously unknown variable) and further reasonable assumption on clumping\nfactor and the production efficiency of Lyman continuum photons, we conclude\nthat the average population of galaxies is just capable to reionize the\nuniverse by z ~ 6.\n", "  Semileptonic and purely leptonic decays of B meson to $\\tau$, such as $B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ and $B\\to\\tau\\nu_\\tau$ are studied. Recognizing that\nthere already were some weak hints of possible deviations from the SM in the\nmeasurements of $\\mathcal{B}(B\\to\\tau\\nu_\\tau)$ by \\Babar~and Belle and the\nfact that detection of the $\\tau$ also occurs in the measurements of $B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$, we stress the importance of joint studies of these\nprocesses, whenever possible. For this purpose, as an illustration, we\nintroduce the observable, $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\\mathcal{B}(B\\to\\tau\\nu_\\tau)$\nwhere, for one thing, the unknown systematics due to $\\tau$ identification are\nexpected to largely cancel. We show that all measurements of this observable\nare consistent with the existing data, within somewhat largish experimental\nerrors, with the predictions of the SM. We stress that precise experimental\nmeasurement and comparison with theory of the branching ratio for $B \\to \\tau\n\\nu_\\tau$ is extremely important for a reliable search of new physics.\nFurthermore, in view of the anticipated improved precision in experiments in\nthe next few years, in addition to $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$, host of other ratios\nanalogous to $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})/\\mathcal{B}(B \\to \\tau \\nu_{\\tau})$ in the\nSM are suggested for lattice calculations as well, so that for more stringent\ntests of the SM, correlations in lattice calculations can be properly taken\ninto account to enhance precision.\n", "  We study the ionization of atomic hydrogen in the direction of polarization\ndue to a linearly polarized XUV pulse in the presence a strong field IR. We\ndescribe the photoelectron spectra as an interference problem in the time\ndomain. Electron trajectories steming from different optical laser cycles give\nrise to intercycle interference energy peaks known as sidebands. These\nsidebands are modulated by a grosser structure coming from the intracycle\ninterference of the two electron trajectories born during the same optical\ncycle. We make use of a simple semiclassical model which offers the possibility\nto establish a connection between emission times and the photoelectron kinetic\nenergy. We compare the semiclassical predictions with the continuum-distorted\nwave strong field approximation and the ab initio solution of the time\ndependent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We analyze such interference pattern as a\nfunction of the time delay between the IR and XUV pulse and also as a function\nof the laser intensity.\n", "  \"Exotic quarks\" in the title refers to a modification of quark periodicity\ncondition on the thermal circle by introduction of some phases -- known also as\n\"flavor holonomies\" -- different quark flavors. These phases provide a valuable\ntool, to be used for better understanding of deconfinement and chiral\nrestoration phase transitions: by changing them one can dramatically modify\nboth phase transitions. In the language of instanton constituents --\ninstanton-dyons or monopoles -- it has a very direct explanation: the interplay\nof flavor and color holonomies can switch topological zero modes between\nvarious dyon types. The model we will study in detail, the so called\n$Z_{N_c}$-symmetric QCD model with equal number of colors and flavors\n$N_c=N_f=2$ and special arrangement of flavor and color holonomies, ensure\n\"most democratic\" setting, in which each quark flavor and each dyon type are in\none-to-one correspondence. The usual QCD has the opposite \"most exclusive\"\narrangement: all quarks are antiperiodic and thus all zero modes fall on only\none -- twisted or $L$ -- dyon type. As we show by ensemble simulation,\ndeconfinement and chiral restoration phase transitions in these two models are\ndramatically different. In the usual QCD both are smooth crossovers: but in the\ncase of $Z_2$-symmetric model deconfinement becomes strong first order\ntransition, while chiral symmetry remains broken for all dyon densities\nstudied. These results are in good correspondence with those from recent\nlattice simulations.\n", "  We classify all the solutions to the elliptic Toda system associated to a\ngeneral simple Lie algebra with singular sources at the origin and with finite\nenergy. The solution space is shown to be parametrized by a subgroup of the\ncorresponding complex Lie group. We also show the quantization result for the\nfinite integrals. This work generalizes the previous works in [Lin, Wei, Ye]\nand [Nie] for Toda systems of types $A$ and $B, C$. However, a more\nLie-theoretic method is needed here for the general case, and the method relies\nheavily on the structure theories of the local solutions and of the\n$W$-invariants for the Toda system. This work will have applications to\nnonabelian Chern-Simons-Higgs gauge theory and to the mean field equations of\nToda type.\n", "  The atmosphere of the exoplanet HD 209458b is undergoing sustained mass loss,\nbelieved to be caused by X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation from\nits star. The majority of this flux is not directly observable due to\ninterstellar absorption, but is required in order to correctly model the\nphoto-evaporation of the planet and photo-ionisation of the outflow. We present\na recovered high energy spectrum for HD\\,209458 using a Differential Emission\nMeasure (DEM) retrieval technique. We construct a model of the stellar corona\nand transition region for temperatures between 10$^{4.1}$ and 10$^{8}$ K which\nis constrained jointly by ultraviolet line strengths measured with the Cosmic\nOrigins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and X-ray flux\nmeasurements from XMM-Newton. The total hydrogen ionising luminosity ($\\lambda\n< 912$ \\AA) is found to be 10$^{28.26}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is similar to the\nvalue for the mean activity level of the Sun. This luminosity is incompatible\nwith energy limited mass loss rates estimated from the same COS dataset, even\nthe lower bound requires an uncomfortably high energetic efficiency of >40%.\nHowever, our luminosity is compatible with early estimates of the mass loss\nrate of HD 209458b based on results from the HST Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph (STIS). Precisely reconstructed XUV irradiation is a key input to\ndetermining mass loss rates and efficiencies for exoplanet atmospheres.\n", "  Dozens of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been identified at\noptical, UV and X-ray wavelengths. A small fraction of these, most notably\nSwift J1644+57, produce radio synchrotron emission, consistent with a powerful,\nrelativistic jet shocking the surrounding circumnuclear gas. The dearth of\nsimilar non-thermal radio emission in the majority of TDEs may imply that\npowerful jet formation is intrinsically rare, or that the conditions in\ngalactic nuclei are typically unfavorable for producing a detectable signal.\nHere we explore the latter possibility by constraining the radial profile of\nthe gas density encountered by a TDE jet using a one-dimensional model for the\ncircumnuclear medium which includes mass and energy input from a stellar\npopulation. Near the jet Sedov radius of 10$^{18}$ cm, we find gas densities in\nthe range of $n_{18} \\sim$ 0.1$-$1000 cm$^{-3}$ across a wide range of\nplausible star formation histories. Using one- and two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamical simulations, we calculate the synchrotron radio light curves of\nTDE jets (as viewed both on and off-axis) across the allowed range of density\nprofiles. We find that bright radio emission would be produced across the\nplausible range of nuclear gas densities by jets as powerful as Swift J1644+57,\nand we quantify the relationship between the radio luminosity and jet energy.\nWe use existing radio detections and upper limits to constrain the energy\ndistribution of TDE jets. Radio follow up observations several months to\nseveral years after the TDE candidate will strongly constrain the energetics of\nany relativistic flow.\n", "  The linear birefringence of uniaxial crystal plates is known since the 17th\ncentury, and it is widely used in numerous optical setups and devices. Here we\ndemonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, a fine lateral circular\nbirefringence of such crystal plates. This effect is a novel example of the\nspin-Hall effect of light, i.e., a transverse spin-dependent shift of the\nparaxial light beam transmitted through the plate. The well-known linear\nbirefringence and the new circular birefringence form an interesting analogy\nwith the Goos-H\\\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov beam shifts that appear in the light\nreflection at a dielectric interface. We report the experimental observation of\nthe effect in a remarkably simple system of a tilted half-wave plate and\npolarizers using polarimetric and quantum-weak-measurement techniques for the\nbeam-shift measurements. In view of great recent interest in spin-orbit\ninteraction phenomena, our results could find applications in modern\npolarization optics and nano-photonics.\n", "  The Thomson scattering spectra by an electron moving in the laser-magnetic\nresonance acceleration regime are computed numerically and analytically. The\ndependence of fundamental frequency on the laser intensity and magnetic\nresonance parameter is examined carefully. By calculating the emission of a\nsingle electron in a circularly polarized plane-wave laser field and constant\nexternal magnetic field, the scale invariance of the radiation spectra is\nevident in terms of harmonic orders. The scaling law of backscattered spectra\nare exhibited remarkably for the laser intensity as well for the initial axial\nmomentum of the electron when the cyclotron frequency of the electron\napproaches the laser frequency. The results indicate that the magnetic\nresonance parameter plays an important role on the strength of emission. And\nthe rich features of scattering spectra found may be applicable to the\nradiation source tunability.\n", "  The integration of the spin degree of freedom in charge-based electronic\ndevices has revolutionised both sensing and memory capability in\nmicroelectronics. Further development in spintronic devices requires electrical\nmanipulation of spin current for logic operations. The approach followed so\nfar, inspired by the seminal proposal of the Datta and Das spin modulator, has\nrelied on the spin-orbit field as a medium for electrical control of the spin\nstate. However, the still standing challenge is to find a material whose\nspin-orbit-coupling (SOC) is weak enough to transport spins over long\ndistances, while also being strong enough to allow their electrical\nmanipulation. Here we demonstrate a radically different approach by engineering\na heterostructure from atomically thin crystals, which are \"glued\" by weak van\nder Waals (vdW) forces and which combine the superior spin transport properties\nof graphene with the strong SOC of the semiconducting MoS$_{2}$. The spin\ntransport in the graphene channel is modulated between ON and OFF states by\ntuning the spin absorption into the MoS$_{2}$ layer with a gate electrode. Our\ndemonstration of a spin field-effect transistor using two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials identifies a new route towards spin logic operations for beyond CMOS\ntechnology.\n", "  Primordial features are one of the most important extensions of the Standard\nModel of cosmology, providing a wealth of information on the primordial\nuniverse, ranging from discrimination between inflation and alternative\nscenarios, new particle detection, to fine structures in the inflationary\npotential. We study the prospects of future large-scale structure (LSS) surveys\non the detection and constraints of these features. We classify primordial\nfeature models into several classes, and for each class we present a simple\ntemplate of power spectrum that encodes the essential physics. We study how\nwell the most ambitious LSS surveys proposed to date, including both\nspectroscopic and photometric surveys, will be able to improve the constraints\nwith respect to the current Planck data. We find that these LSS surveys will\nsignificantly improve the experimental sensitivity on features signals that are\noscillatory in scales, due to the 3D information. For a broad range of models,\nthese surveys will be able to reduce the errors of the amplitudes of the\nfeatures by a factor of 5 or more, including several interesting candidates\nidentified in the recent Planck data. Therefore, LSS surveys offer an\nimpressive opportunity for primordial feature discovery in the next decade or\ntwo. We also compare the advantages of both types of surveys.\n", "  Mergers of binary neutron stars and black hole-neutron star binaries produce\ngravitational-wave (GW) emission and outflows with significant kinetic\nenergies. These outflows result in radio emissions through synchrotron\nradiation. We explore the detectability of these synchrotron generated radio\nsignals by follow-up observations of GW merger events lacking a detection of\nelectromagnetic counterparts in other wavelengths. We model radio light curves\narising from (i) sub-relativistic merger ejecta and (ii) ultra-relativistic\njets. The former produces radio remnants on timescales of a few years and the\nlatter produces $\\gamma$-ray bursts in the direction of the jet and\norphan-radio afterglows extending over wider angles on timescales of weeks.\nBased on the derived light curves, we suggest an optimized survey at $1.4$ GHz\nwith five epochs separated by a logarithmic time interval. We estimate the\ndetectability of the radio counterparts of simulated GW-merger events to be\ndetected by advanced LIGO and Virgo by current and future radio facilities. The\ndetectable distances for these GW merger events could be as high as 1 Gpc.\n$20$--$60\\%$ of the long-lasting radio remnants will be detectable in the case\nof the moderate kinetic energy of $3\\cdot 10^{50}$ erg and a circum-merger\ndensity of $0.1 {\\rm cm^{-3}}$ or larger, while $5$--$20\\%$ of the orphan radio\nafterglows with kinetic energy of $10^{48}$ erg will be detectable. The\ndetection likelihood increases if one focuses on the well-localizable GW\nevents. We discuss the background noise due to radio fluxes of host galaxies\nand false positives arising from extragalactic radio transients and variable\nActive Galactic Nuclei and we show that the quiet radio transient sky is of\ngreat advantage when searching for the radio counterparts.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators (TIs), a new state of quantum\nmatter, are promising for achieving the low-power-consuming electronic devices\nowning to the remarkable robustness of their conducting edge states against\nbackscattering. Currently, the major challenge to further studies and possible\napplications is the lack of suitable materials, which should be with high\nfeasibility of fabrication and sizeable nontrivial gaps. Here, we demonstrate\nthrough first-principles calculations that SiTe 2D crystal is a promising 2D TI\nwith a sizeable nontrivial gap of 0.220 eV. This material is dynamically and\nthermally stable. Most importantly, it could be easily exfoliated from its\nthree-dimensional superlattice due to the weakly bonded layered structure.\nMoreover, strain engineering can effectively control its nontrivial gap and\neven induce a topological phase transition. Our results provide a realistic\ncandidate for experimental explorations and potential applications of 2D TIs.\n", "  We introduce a new, resummed, analytical form of the post-Newtonian (PN),\nfactorized, multipolar amplitude corrections $f_{\\ell m}$ of the\neffective-one-body (EOB) gravitational waveform of spinning, nonprecessing,\ncircularized, coalescing black hole binaries (BBHs). This stems from the\nfollowing two-step paradigm: (i) the factorization of the orbital\n(spin-independent) terms in $f_{\\ell m}$; (ii) the resummation of the residual\nspin (or orbital) factors. We find that resumming the residual spin factor by\ntaking its inverse resummed (iResum) is an efficient way to obtain amplitudes\nthat are more accurate in the strong-field, fast-velocity regime. The\nperformance of the method is illustrated on the $\\ell=2$ and $m=(1,2)$ waveform\nmultipoles, both for a test-mass orbiting around a Kerr black hole and for\ncomparable-mass BBHs. In the first case, the iResum $f_{\\ell m}$'s are much\ncloser to the corresponding \"exact\" functions (obtained solving numerically the\nTeukolsky equation) up to the light-ring, than the nonresummed ones, especially\nwhen the black-hole spin is nearly extremal. The iResum paradigm is also more\nefficient than including higher post-Newtonian terms (up to 20PN order): the\nresummed 5PN information yields per se a rather good numerical/analytical\nagreement at the last-stable-orbit, and a well-controlled behavior up to the\nlight-ring. For comparable mass binaries (including the highest PN-order\ninformation available, 3.5PN), comparing EOB with Numerical Relativity (NR)\ndata shows that the analytical/numerical fractional disagreement at merger,\nwithout NR-calibration of the EOB waveform, is generically reduced by iResum,\nfrom a $40\\%$ of the usual approach to just a few percents. This suggests that\nEOBNR waveform models for coalescing BBHs may be improved using iResum\namplitudes.\n", "  The memory effect is a prediction of general relativity on the same footing\nas the existence of gravitational waves. The memory effect is understood at\nfuture null infinity as a transition induced by null radiation from a\nPoincar\\'e vacuum to another vacuum. Those are related by a supertranslation,\nwhich is a fundamental symmetry of asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this\nessay, I argue that finite supertranslation diffeomorphisms should be extended\ninto the bulk spacetime consistently with canonical charge conservation. It\nthen leads to fascinating geometrical features of gravitational Poincar\\'e\nvacua. I then argue that in the process of black hole merger or gravitational\ncollapse, dramatic but computable memory effects occur. They lead to a final\nstationary metric which qualitatively deviates from the Schwarzschild metric.\n", "  We investigate the equilibrium phase-coherence properties of Bose-condensed\nparticle systems, focusing on their shape dependence and finite-size scaling\n(FSS). We consider three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous systems confined to\nanisotropic L x L x L_a boxes, below the BEC transition temperature $T_c$. We\nshow that the phase correlations develop peculiar anisotropic FSS for any\n$T<T_c$, in the large-$L$ limit keeping the ratio \\lambda = L_a/L^2 fixed. This\nphenomenon is effectively described by the 3D spin-wave (SW) theory. Its\nuniversality is confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the 3D\nBose-Hubbard model in the BEC phase. The phase-coherence properties of very\nelongated BEC systems, \\lambda>>1, are characterized by a coherence length\n\\xi_a \\sim A_t \\rho_s/T where A_t is the transverse area and \\rho_s is the\nsuperfluid density.\n", "  We study finite temperature properties of metals close to an Ising-nematic\nquantum critical point in two spatial dimensions. In particular we show that at\nany finite temperature there is a regime where order parameter fluctuations are\ncharacterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z=2$, in contrast to $z=3$\nfound at zero temperature. Our results are based on a simple Eliashberg-type\napproach, which gives rise to a boson self-energy proportional to\n$\\Omega/\\gamma(T)$ at small momenta, where $\\gamma(T)$ is the temperature\ndependent fermion scattering rate. These findings might shed some light on\nrecent Monte-Carlo simulations at finite temperature, where results consistent\nwith $z=2$ were found.\n", "  Thin films of the iron-based superconductor BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 (Ba122:P) were\nfabricated on polycrystalline metal-tape substrates with two kinds of in-plane\ngrain boundary alignments (well aligned (4 deg.) and poorly aligned (8 deg.))\nby pulsed laser deposition. The poorly aligned substrate is not applicable to\ncuprate-coated conductors because the in-plane alignment >4 deg. results in\nexponential decay of the critical current density (Jc). The Ba122:P film\nexhibited higher Jc at 4 K when grown on the poorly aligned substrate than on\nthe well-aligned substrate even though the crystallinity was poorer. It was\nrevealed that the misorientation angles of the poorly aligned samples were less\nthan 6 deg., which are less than the critical angle of an iron-based\nsuperconductor, cobalt-doped BaFe2As2 (~9 deg.), and the observed strong\npinning in the Ba122:P is attributed to the high-density grain boundaries with\nthe misorientation angles smaller than the critical angle. This result reveals\na distinct advantage over cuprate-coated conductors because well-aligned\nmetal-tape substrates are not necessary for practical applications of the\niron-based superconductors.\n", "  We describe an atom interferometric gravitational wave detector design that\ncan operate in a resonant mode for increased sensitivity. By oscillating the\npositions of the atomic wavepackets, this resonant detection mode allows for\ncoherently enhanced, narrow-band sensitivity at target frequencies. The\nproposed detector is flexible and can be rapidly switched between broadband and\nnarrow-band detection modes. For instance, a binary discovered in broadband\nmode can subsequently be studied further as the inspiral evolves by using a\ntailored narrow-band detector response. In addition to functioning like a\nlock-in amplifier for astrophysical events, the enhanced sensitivity of the\nresonant approach also opens up the possibility of searching for important\ncosmological signals, including the stochastic gravitational wave background\nproduced by inflation. We give an example of detector parameters which would\nallow detection of inflationary gravitational waves down to $\\Omega_\\text{GW}\n\\sim 10^{-14}$ for a two satellite space-based detector.\n", "  Simultaneous observations of microlensing events from multiple locations\nallow for the breaking of degeneracies between the physical properties of the\nlensing system, specifically by exploring different regions of the lens plane\nand by directly measuring the \"microlens parallax\". We report the discovery of\na 30-55$M_J$ brown dwarf orbiting a K dwarf in microlensing event\nOGLE-2015-BLG-1319. The system is located at a distance of $\\sim$5 kpc toward\nthe Galactic bulge. The event was observed by several ground-based groups as\nwell as by $Spitzer$ and $Swift$, allowing the measurement of the physical\nproperties. However, the event is still subject to an 8-fold degeneracy, in\nparticular the well-known close-wide degeneracy, and thus the projected\nseparation between the two lens components is either $\\sim$0.25 AU or $\\sim$45\nAU. This is the first microlensing event observed by $Swift$, with the UVOT\ncamera. We study the region of microlensing parameter space to which $Swift$ is\nsensitive, finding that while for this event $Swift$ could not measure the\nmicrolens parallax with respect to ground-based observations, it can be\nimportant for other events. Specifically, for detecting nearby brown dwarfs and\nfree-floating planets in high magnification events.\n", "  Due to strong mode-confinement, long propagation-distance, and unique\ntunability, graphene plasmons have been widely explored in the mid-infrared and\nterahertz windows. However, it remains a big challenge to push graphene\nplasmons to shorter wavelengths in order to integrate graphene plasmon concepts\nwith existing mature technologies in the near-infrared region. We investigate\nlocalized graphene plasmons supported by graphene nanodisks and experimentally\ndemonstrated graphene plasmon working at 2 {\\mu}m with the aid of a fully\nscalable block copolymer self-assembly method. Our results show a promising way\nto promote graphene plasmons for both fundamental studies and potential\napplications in the near-infrared window.\n", "  Assuming that the early universe had (i) a description using perturbative\nstring theory and its field theory limit (ii) an epoch of slow-roll inflation\nwithin a four-dimensional effective field theory and a hierarchy of scales\n$M_{inf} < m_{kk} < m_s \\lesssim M_{pl}$ that keeps the latter under control,\nwe derive an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves.\nThe bound is very sensitive to mild changes in numerical coefficients and the\nexpansion parameters. For example, allowing couplings and mass-squared\nhierarchies $\\lesssim 0.2$, implies $r \\lesssim 0.05$, but asking more safely\nfor hierarchies $\\lesssim 0.1$, the bound becomes $r \\lesssim 10^{-6}$.\nMoreover, large volumes -- typically used in string models to keep backreaction\nand moduli stabilisation under control -- drive $r$ down. Consequently, any\ndetection of inflationary gravitational waves would present an interesting but\ndifficult challenge for string theory.\n", "  We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical analysis of a number\nof measured ground-state-to-ground-state single $\\beta^+$/electron-capture and\n$\\beta^-$ decays in the nuclear mass range A = 62 - 142. The corresponding\nexperimental comparative half-lives (log ft values) are compared with the\ntheoretical ones obtained by the use of the proton-neutron quasiparticle\nrandom-phase approximation (pnQRPA) with G-matrix based effective interactions.\nThe MCMC analysis is performed separately for 47 isobaric triplets and 28 more\nextended isobaric chains of nuclei to extract values and uncertainties for the\neffective axial-vector coupling constant g_A in nuclear-structure calculations\nperformed in the pnQRPA framework. As far as available, measured half-lives for\ntwo-neutrino double beta-minus decays occurring in the studied isobaric chains\nare analyzed as well.\n", "  Though the main applications of computer simulations in relativity are to\nastrophysical systems such as black holes and neutron stars, nonetheless there\nare important applications of numerical methods to the investigation of general\nrelativity as a fundamental theory of the nature of space and time. This paper\ngives an overview of some of these applications. In particular we cover (i)\ninvestigations of the properties of spacetime singularities such as those that\noccur in the interior of black holes and in big bang cosmology. (ii)\ninvestigations of critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation in\ngravitational collapse. (iii) investigations inspired by string theory, in\nparticular analogs of black holes in more than 4 spacetime dimensions and\ngravitational collapse in spacetimes with a negative cosmological constant.\n", "  To date, reflectance spectra of Jupiter Trojan asteroids have revealed no\ndistinctive absorption features. For this reason, the surface composition of\nthese objects remains a subject of speculation. Spectra have revealed, however,\nthat the Jupiter Trojan asteroids consist of two distinct sub-populations which\ndiffer in the optical to near-infrared colors. The origins and compositional\ndifferences between the two sub-populations remain unclear. Here we report the\nresults from a 2.2-3.8 $\\mu$m spectral survey of a collection of 16 Jupiter\nTrojan asteroids, divided equally between the two sub-populations. We find\nclear spectral absorption features centered around 3.1 $\\mu$m in the less red\npopulation. Additional absorption consistent with expected from organic\nmaterials might also be present. No such features are see in the red\npopulation. A strong correlation exists between the strength of the 3.1 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature and the optical to near-infrared color of the objects. While\ntraditionally absorptions such as these in dark asteroids are modeled as being\ndue to fine-grain water frost, we find it physically implausible that the\nspecial circumstances required to create such fine-grained frost would exist on\na substantial fraction of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. We suggest, instead,\nthat the 3.1 $\\mu$m absorption on Trojans and other dark asteroids could be due\nto N-H stretch features. Additionally, we point out that reflectivities derived\nfrom WISE observations show a strong absorption beyond 4$\\mu$m for both\npopulations. The continuum of 3.1 $\\mu$m features and the common absorption\nbeyond 4 $\\mu$m might suggest that both sub-populations of Jupiter Trojan\nasteroids formed in the same general region of the early solar system.\n", "  Investigations of strain correlations at the glass transition reveal\nunexpected phenomena. The shear strain fluctuations show an Eshelby-strain\npattern ($\\,\\sim \\cos{(4\\theta)}/r^2\\,$), characteristic for elastic response,\neven in liquids at long times [1]. We address this using a mode-coupling theory\nfor the strain fluctuations in supercooled liquids and data from both, video\nmicroscopy of a two-dimensional colloidal glass former and simulations of\nBrownian hard disks. We show that long-ranged and long-lived strain-signatures\nfollow a scaling law valid close to the glass transition. For large enough\nviscosities, the Eshelby-strain pattern is visible even on time scales longer\nthan the structural relaxation time $\\tau$ and after the shear modulus has\nrelaxed to zero.\n", "  We investigate the effect of self-propulsion on a mean-field order-disorder\ntransition. Starting from a $\\varphi^4$ scalar field theory subject to an\nexponentially correlated noise, we exploit the Unified Colored Noise\nApproximation to map the non-equilibrium active dynamics onto an effective\nequilibrium one. This allows us to follow the evolution of the second-order\ncritical point as a function of the noise parameters: the correlation time\n$\\tau$ and the noise strength $D$. Our results suggest that $\\tau$ is a crucial\ningredient that changes the location of the critical point but, remarkably, not\nthe universality class of the model. We also estimate the effect of Gaussian\nfluctuations on the mean-field approximation finding an Ornstein-Zernike like\nexpression for the static structure factor at long wave lengths. Finally, to\nassess the validity of our predictions, we compare the mean-field theoretical\nresults with numerical simulations of active Lennard-Jones particles in two and\nthree dimensions, finding a good qualitative agreement at small $\\tau$ values.\n", "  It is generally believed that free-standing graphene does not demonstrate any\nferroic properties. In the present work we revise this statement and show that\nsingle graphene sheet with a pair of magnetic adatoms can be driven into\nferroelectric (FE) and multiferroic (MF) phases by tuning the Dirac cones\nslope. The transition into the FE phase occurs gradually, but an anomalous MF\nphase appears abruptly by means of a Quantum Phase Transition. Our findings\nsuggest that such features should exist in graphene recently investigated by\nScanning Tunneling Microscopy (Science 352, 437 (2016)).\n", "  Motivated by the recent detection of gravitational waves from the black hole\nbinary merger GW150914, we study the dynamical evolution of black holes in\ngalactic nuclei where massive star clusters reside. With masses of ~10^7M_Sun\nand sizes of only a few parsecs, nuclear star clusters are the densest stellar\nsystems observed in the local universe and represent a robust environment where\n(stellar mass) black hole binaries can dynamically form, harden and merge. We\nshow that due to their large escape speeds, nuclear star clusters can keep a\nlarge fraction of their merger remnants while also evolving rapidly enough that\nthe holes can sink back to the central regions where they can swap in new\nbinaries that can subsequently harden and merge. This process can repeat\nseveral times and produce black hole mergers of several tens of solar masses\nsimilar to GW150914 and up to a few hundreds of solar masses, without the need\nof invoking extremely low metallicity environments or implausible initial\nconditions. We use a semi-analytical approach to describe the formation and\ndynamics of black holes in massive star clusters. We find a black hole binary\nmerger rate per volume from nuclear star clusters of ~1.5 Gpc^-3 yr^-1,\nimplying up to a few tens of possible detections per year with Advanced LIGO.\nOur models suggest a local merger rate of 0.3- 1 Gpc^-3 yr^-1 for high mass\nblack hole binaries similar to GW150914 (total mass >~ 50 M_Sun, redshift z<\n0.3); a merger rate comparable to that of high mass black hole binaries that\nare dynamically assembled in globular clusters. Finally, we show that if all\nblack holes receive high natal kicks, >~50km s^-1, then nuclear star clusters\ncould dominate the local merger rate of binary black holes compared to the\nmerger rate of similar binaries produced in either globular clusters or through\nisolated binary evolution.\n", "  The fraction of ionizing photons escaping from high-redshift star-forming\ngalaxies remains a key obstacle in evaluating whether galaxies were the primary\nagents of cosmic reionization. We previously proposed using the covering\nfraction of low-ionization gas, measured via deep absorption line spectroscopy,\nas a proxy. We now present a significant update, sampling seven\ngravitationally-lensed sources at $4<z<5$. We show that the absorbing gas in\nour sources is spatially inhomogeneous with a median covering fraction of 66\\%.\nCorrecting for reddening according to a dust-in-cloud model, this implies an\nestimated absolute escape fraction of $\\simeq19\\pm6$\\%. With possible biases\nand uncertainties, collectively we find the average escape fraction could be\nreduced to no less than 11\\%, excluding the effect of spatial variations. For\none of our lensed sources, we have sufficient signal/noise to demonstrate the\npresence of such spatial variations and scatter in its dependence on the\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent width, consistent with recent simulations. If this source\nis typical, our lower limit to the escape fraction could be reduced by a\nfurther factor $\\simeq$2. Across our sample, we find a modest anti-correlation\nbetween the inferred escape fraction and the local star formation rate,\nconsistent with a time delay between a burst and leaking Lyman continuum\nphotons. Our analysis demonstrates considerable variations in the escape\nfraction consistent with being governed by the small-scale behavior of\nstar-forming regions, whose activities fluctuate over short timescales. This\nsupports the suggestion that the escape fraction may increase toward the\nreionization era when star formation becomes more energetic and burst-like.\n", "  Phenomenological functions $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$ (also known as $G_{\\rm\nlight}/G$ and $G_{\\rm matter}/G$) are commonly used to parameterize possible\nmodifications of the Poisson equation relating the matter density contrast to\nthe lensing and the Newtonian potentials, respectively. They will be well\nconstrained by future surveys of large scale structure. But what would the\nimplications of measuring particular values of these functions be for modified\ngravity theories? We ask this question in the context of general Horndeski\nclass of single field scalar-tensor theories with second order equations of\nmotion. We find several consistency conditions that make it possible to rule\nout broad classes of theories based on measurements of $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$ that\nare independent of their parametric forms. For instance, a measurement of\n$\\Sigma \\ne 1$ would rule out all models with a canonical form of kinetic\nenergy, while finding $\\Sigma-1$ and $\\mu-1$ to be of opposite sign would\nstrongly disfavour the entire class of Horndeski models. We separately examine\nthe large and the small scale limits, the possibility of scale-dependence, and\nthe consistency with bounds on the speed of gravitational waves. We identify\nsub-classes of Horndeski theories that can be ruled out based on the measured\ndifference between $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$.\n", "  A classical way for exploring the scattering behavior of a small sphere is to\napproximate Mie coefficients with a Taylor series expansion. This ansatz\ndelivered a plethora of insightful results, mostly for small spheres supporting\nlocalized plasmonic resonances. However, many scattering aspects are still\nuncharted, especially with regards to magnetic resonances. Here, an alternative\nsystem ansatz is proposed based on the Pad\\'e approximants for the Mie\ncoefficients. The result reveal the existence of a self-regulating radiative\ndamping mechanism for the first magnetic resonance and new general resonating\naspects for the higher order multipoles. Hence, a systematic way of exploring\nthe scattering behavior is introduced, sharpening our understanding about the\nsphere's scattering behavior and its emergent functionalities.\n", "  After identifying the nuclei in the regions near A =80 and A = 160 for which\nbeta-decay rates have the greatest effect on weak and main r-process abundance\npatterns, we apply the finite-amplitude method (FAM) with Skyrme energy-density\nfunctionals (EDFs) to calculate beta-decay half-lives of those nuclei in the\nquasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA). We use the equal filling\napproximation to extend our implementation of the charge-changing FAM, which\nincorporates pairing correlations and allows axially symmetric deformation, to\nodd-A and odd-odd nuclei. Within this framework we find differences of up to a\nfactor of seven between our calculated beta-decay half-lives and those of\nprevious efforts. Repeated calculations with nuclei near A = 160 and multiple\nEDFs show a spread of two to four in beta-decay half-lives, with differences in\ncalculated Q values playing an important role. We investigate the implications\nof these results for r-process simulations.\n", "  In the last decade, the quantum chemical version of the density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) method has established itself as the method of\nchoice for calculations of strongly correlated molecular systems. Despite its\nfavourable scaling, it is in practice not suitable for computations of dynamic\ncorrelation. We present a novel method for accurate \"post-DMRG\" treatment of\ndynamic correlation based on the tailored coupled cluster (CC) theory in which\nthe DMRG method is responsible for the proper description of non-dynamic\ncorrelation, whereas dynamic correlation is incorporated through the framework\nof the CC theory. We illustrate the potential of this method on prominent\nmultireference systems, in particular N$_2$, Cr$_2$ molecules and also\noxo-Mn(Salen) for which we have performed the first \"post-DMRG\" computations in\norder to shed light on the energy ordering of the lowest spin states.\n", "  We present a new method for simulating cosmologies that contain massive\nparticles with thermal free streaming motion, such as massive neutrinos or\nwarm/hot dark matter. This method combines particle and fluid descriptions of\nthe thermal species to eliminate the shot noise known to plague conventional\nN-body simulations. We describe this method in detail, along with results for a\nnumber of test cases to validate our method, and check its range of\napplicability. Using this method, we demonstrate that massive neutrinos can\nproduce a significant scale-dependence in the large-scale biasing of deep voids\nin the matter field. We show that this scale-dependence may be quantitatively\nunderstood using an extremely simple spherical expansion model which reproduces\nthe behavior of the void bias for different neutrino parameters.\n", "  In color SU(2) lattice QCD, we investigate colored-diquark distributions in\ntwo-hadron scatterings by means of Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes on the lattice.\nWith colored-diquark operators in the Coulomb gauge, we measure components of\ntwo colored diquarks realized as intermediate states via one gluon exchange\n(OGE) processes in hadron scattering. From the colored-diquark distributions,\nwe estimate the dominant range of gluon (color) exchanges between closely\nlocated two hadrons. We find that the colored-diquark components are enhanced\nat the short range ($\\leq$0.2 fm) and their tails show the single-exponential\ndamping. In order to distinguish the genuine colored-diquark components\noriginating in the color exchange processes from trivial colored two-quark\ncomponents contained in two color-singlet hadrons as a result of simple\ntransformation of hadronic basis, we repeat the analyses on the artificially\nconstructed gauge fields, where low- and high-momentum gluon components are\ndecoupled and only restricted pair of quarks can share and exchange\nlow-momentum gluons. We observe qualitatively the same behaviors and confirm\nthat the short-range enhancement of the colored-diquark distributions is the\ngenuine OGE-origin color excitation in hadron scattering.\n", "  We use a relativistic model of meson-exchange currents to compute the\nproton-neutron and proton-proton yields in $(e,e')$ scattering from $^{12}$C in\nthe 2p-2h channel. We compute the response functions and cross section with the\nrelativistic Fermi gas model for a range of kinematics from intermediate to\nhigh momentum transfers. We find a large contribution of neutron-proton\nconfigurations in the initial state, as compared to proton-proton pairs. The\ndifferent emission probabilities of distinct species of nucleon pairs are\nproduced in our model only by meson-exchange currents, mainly by the $\\Delta$\nisobar current. We also analyze the effect of the exchange contribution and\nshow that the direct/exchange interference strongly affects the determination\nof the np/pp ratio.\n", "  Spontaneous charge ordering occurring in correlated systems may be considered\nas a possible route to generate effective lattice structures with\nunconventional couplings. For this purpose we investigate the phase diagram of\ndoped extended Hubbard models on two lattices: (i) the honeycomb lattice with\non-site $U$ and nearest-neighbor $V$ Coulomb interactions at $3/4$ filling\n($n=3/2$) and (ii) the triangular lattice with on-site $U$, nearest-neighbor\n$V$, and next-nearest-neighbor $V'$ Coulomb interactions at $3/8$ filling\n($n=3/4$). We consider various approaches including mean-field approximations,\nperturbation theory, and variational Monte Carlo. For the honeycomb case (i),\ncharge order induces an effective triangular lattice at large values of $U/t$\nand $V/t$, where $t$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping integral. The\nnearest-neighbor spin exchange interactions on this effective triangular\nlattice are antiferromagnetic in most of the phase diagram, while they become\nferromagnetic when $U$ is much larger than $V$. At $U/t\\sim (V/t)^3$,\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions nearly cancel out,\nleading to a system with four-spin ring-exchange interactions. On the other\nhand, for the triangular case (ii) at large $U$ and finite $V'$, we find no\ncharge order for small $V$, an effective kagome lattice for intermediate $V$,\nand one-dimensional charge order for large $V$. These results indicate that\nCoulomb interactions induce [case (i)] or enhance [case(ii)] emergent\ngeometrical frustration of the spin degrees of freedom in the system, by\nforming charge order.\n", "  Kepler observations have uncovered the existence of a large number of\nclose-in exoplanets and serendipitously of stellar superflares with emissions\nseveral orders of magnitude higher than those observed on the Sun. The\ninteraction between the two and its implications on planetary habitability is\nof great interest to the community. Stellar Proton Events interact with\nplanetary atmospheres, generate secondary particles and increase the radiation\ndose on the surface. This effect is amplified for close-in exoplanets and can\nbe a serious threat to potential planetary life. Monte Carlo simulations are\nused to model the SPE-induced particle radiation dose on the surface of such\nexoplanets. The results show a wide range of surface radiation doses on planets\nin close-in configurations with varying atmospheric column depths, magnetic\nmoments and orbital radii. It can be concluded that for close-in exoplanets\nwith sizable atmospheres and magnetospheres, the radiation dose contributed by\nstellar superflares may not be high enough to sterilize a planet (for life as\nwe know it) but can result in frequent extinction level events. In light of\nrecent reports, the interaction of hard-spectrum SPEs with the atmosphere of\nProxima Centauri b is modeled and implications on its habitability is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We may call \"alien particles\" those particles belonging to the matter/field\ncontent of a $d$-dimensional brane other than the $3$-brane (or stack of\nbranes) sweeping the space-time in which we live. They can appear in our\nspace-time at the regions of intersection between our and their brane. They can\nbe identified (or not) as alien matter depending on their properties, on the\nphysical laws governing their evolution in the \"homeland\" brane, and on the\ndetails of our detection techniques.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of self-energy embedding theory (SEET) which\nis a quantum embedding scheme allowing us to describe a chosen subsystem very\naccurately while keeping the description of the environment at a lower cost. We\napply SEET to molecular examples where commonly our chosen subsystem is made\nout of a set of strongly correlated orbitals while the weakly correlated\norbitals constitute an environment. Such a self-energy separation is very\ngeneral and to make this procedure applicable to multiple systems a detailed\nand practical procedure for the evaluation of the system and environment\nself-energy is necessary. We list all the intricacies for one of the possible\nprocedures while focusing our discussion on many practical implementation\naspects such as the choice of best orbital basis, impurity solver, and many\nsteps necessary to reach chemical accuracy. Finally, on a set of carefully\nchosen molecular examples, we demonstrate that SEET which is a controlled,\nsystematically improvable Green's function method can be as accurate as\nestablished wavefunction quantum chemistry methods.\n", "  Hyper-luminous infrared galaxies (HyLIRGs) lie at the extreme luminosity end\nof the IR galaxy population with $L_{\\rm IR}>10^{13}$L$_\\odot$. They are\nthought to be closer counterparts of the more distant sub-mm galaxies, and\nshould therefore be optimal targets to study the most massive systems in\nformation. We present deep $Chandra$ observations of IRAS~F15307+3252 (100ks),\na classical HyLIRG located at $z=$0.93 and hosting a radio-loud AGN ($L_{\\rm\n1.4 GHz}\\sim3.5\\times10^{25}$ W/Hz). The $Chandra$ images reveal the presence\nof extended ($r=160$ kpc), asymmetric X-ray emission in the soft 0.3-2.0 keV\nband that has no radio counterpart. We therefore argue that the emission is of\nthermal origin originating from a hot intragroup or intracluster medium\nvirializing in the potential. We find that the temperature ($\\sim2$ keV) and\nbolometric X-ray luminosity ($\\sim3\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the gas\nfollow the expected $L_{\\rm X-ray}-T$ correlation for groups and clusters, and\nthat the gas has a remarkably short cooling time of $1.2$ Gyrs. In addition,\nVLA radio observations reveal that the galaxy hosts an unresolved compact\nsteep-spectrum (CSS) source, most likely indicating the presence of a young\nradio source similar to 3C186. We also confirm that the nucleus is dominated by\na redshifted 6.4 keV Fe K$\\alpha$ line, strongly suggesting that the AGN is\nCompton-thick. Finally, Hubble images reveal an over-density of galaxies and\nsub-structure in the galaxy that correlates with soft X-ray emission. This\ncould be a snapshot view of on-going groupings expected in a growing cluster\nenvironment. IRAS~F15307+3252 might therefore be a rare example of a group in\nthe process of transforming into a cluster.\n", "  We re-examine the determination of $|V_{cb}|$ from $B\\to D \\ell \\nu$ in view\nof recent experimental and theoretical progress, discussing the\nparameterization of the form factors and studying the role played by the\nunitarity constraints. Our fit to experimental and lattice results for $B\\to D\n\\ell \\nu$ gives $|V_{cb}|=40.49(97)\\ 10^{-3}$ and to $R(D)= 0.299(3)$.\n", "  We study inelastic resonant scattering of a Gaussian wave packet with the\nparameters close to a zero of the complex scattering coefficient. We\ndemonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that such near-zero\nscattering can result in anomalously-large time delays and frequency shifts of\nthe scattered wave packet. Furthermore, we reveal a close analogy of these\nanomalous shifts with the spatial and angular Goos-H\\\"anchen optical beam\nshifts, which are amplified via quantum weak measurements. However, in contrast\nto other beam-shift and weak-measurement systems, we deal with a\none-dimensional scalar wave without any intrinsic degrees of freedom. It is the\nnon-Hermitian nature of the system that produces its rich and non-trivial\nbehaviour. Our results are generic for any scattering problem, either quantum\nor classical. As an example, we consider the transmission of an optical pulse\nthrough a nano-fiber with a side-coupled toroidal micro-resonator. The zero of\nthe transmission coefficient corresponds to the critical coupling conditions.\nExperimental measurements of the time delays near the critical-coupling\nparameters verify our weak-measurement theory and demonstrate amplification of\nthe time delay from the typical inverse resonator linewidth scale to the pulse\nduration scale.\n", "  We have employed spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and Monte-Carlo\nsimulations to investigate the effect of lateral confinement onto the\nnanoskyrmion lattice in Fe/Ir(111). We find a strong coupling of one diagonal\nof the square magnetic unit cell to the close-packed edges of Fe\nnanostructures. In triangular islands this coupling in combination with the\nmismatching symmetries of the islands and of the square nanoskyrmion lattice\nleads to frustration and triple-domain states. In direct vicinity to\nferromagnetic NiFe islands, the surrounding skyrmion lattice forms additional\ndomains. In this case a side of the square magnetic unit cell prefers a\nparallel orientation to the ferromagnetic edge. These experimental findings can\nbe reproduced and explained by Monte-Carlo simulations. Here, the single-domain\nstate of a triangular island is lower in energy, but nevertheless multi-domain\nstates occur due to the combined effect of entropy and an intrinsic domain wall\npinning arising from the skyrmionic character of the spin texture.\n", "  We have performed time-resolved terahertz absorption measurements on\nphotoexcited electron-hole pairs in undoped GaAs quantum wells in magnetic\nfields. We probed both unbound- and bound-carrier responses via cyclotron\nresonance and intraexciton resonance, respectively. The stability of excitons,\nmonitored as the pair density was systematically increased, was found to\ndramatically increase with increasing magnetic field. Specifically, the\n1$s$-2$p_-$ intraexciton transition at 9 T persisted up to the highest density,\nwhereas the 1$s$-2$p$ feature at 0 T was quickly replaced by a free-carrier\nDrude response. Interestingly, at 9 T, the 1$s$-2$p_-$ peak was replaced by\nfree-hole cyclotron resonance at high temperatures, indicating that 2D\nmagnetoexcitons do dissociate under thermal excitation, even though they are\nstable against a density-driven Mott transition.\n", "  What is the role of coherence in determining the distribution of work done on\na quantum system? We approach this question from an operational perspective and\nconsider a setup in which the internal energy of a closed system is recorded by\na quantum detector before and after the system is acted upon by an external\ndrive. We find that the resulting work distribution depends on the initial\nstate of the detector as well as on the choice of the final measurement. We\nconsider two complementary measurement schemes, both of which show clear\nsignatures of quantum interference. We specifically discuss how to implement\nthese schemes in the circuit QED architecture, using an artificial atom as the\nsystem and a quantized mode of the electromagnetic field as the detector.\nDifferent measurement schemes can be realized by preparing the field either in\na superposition of Fock states or in a coherent state and exploiting\nstate-of-the art techniques for the characterization of microwave radiation at\nthe quantum level. More generally, the single bosonic mode we utilize is\narguably the minimal quantum detector capable of capturing the complementary\naspects of the work distribution discussed here.\n", "  We present results from cross-correlating Planck CMB lensing maps with the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy lensing shape catalog and BOSS galaxy\ncatalogs. For galaxy position vs. CMB lensing cross-correlations, we measure\nthe convergence signal around the galaxies in configuration space, using the\nBOSS LOWZ ($z\\sim0.30$) and CMASS ($z\\sim0.57$) samples. With fixed Planck 2015\ncosmology, doing a joint fit with the galaxy clustering measurement, for the\nLOWZ (CMASS) sample we find a galaxy bias $b_g=1.75\\pm0.04$ ($1.95\\pm 0.02$)\nand galaxy-matter cross-correlation coefficient $r_{cc}=1.0\\pm0.2$ ($0.8\\pm\n0.1$) using $20<r_p<70h^{-1}$Mpc, consistent with results from galaxy-galaxy\nlensing. Using the same scales and including the galaxy-galaxy lensing\nmeasurements, we constrain $\\Omega_m=0.284\\pm0.024$ and relative calibration\nbias between the CMB lensing and galaxy lensing to be\n$b_\\gamma=0.82^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$. The combination of galaxy lensing and CMB\nlensing also allows us to measure the cosmological distance ratios (with\n$z_l\\sim0.3$, $z_s\\sim0.5$) $\\mathcal R=\\frac{D_s D_{l,*}}{D_*\nD_{l,s}}=2.68\\pm0.29$, consistent with predictions from the Planck 2015\ncosmology ($\\mathcal R=2.35$). We detect the galaxy position-CMB convergence\ncross-correlation at small scales, $r_p<1h^{-1}$Mpc, and find consistency with\nlensing by NFW halos of mass $M_h\\sim10^{13}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. Finally, we measure\nthe CMB lensing-galaxy shear cross-correlation, finding an amplitude of\n$A=0.76\\pm0.23$ ($z_\\text{eff}=0.35$, $\\theta<2^\\circ$) with respect to Planck\n2015 $\\Lambda$CDM predictions ($1\\sigma$-level consistency). We do not find\nevidence for relative systematics between the CMB and SDSS galaxy lensing.\n", "  We introduce SPARC (Spitzer Photometry & Accurate Rotation Curves): a sample\nof 175 nearby galaxies with new surface photometry at 3.6 um and high-quality\nrotation curves from previous HI/Halpha studies. SPARC spans a broad range of\nmorphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (~5 dex), and surface brightnesses (~4\ndex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of\nstellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass-HI mass relation and\nthe stellar radius-HI radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while\nthe HI mass-radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models\nand quantify the ratio of baryonic-to-observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for\ndifferent characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio\n(M/L) at [3.6]. Assuming M/L=0.5 Msun/Lsun (as suggested by stellar population\nmodels) we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total\nluminosity, (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies\nroughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars\nin line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity\nand surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly\nmaximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These\nbasic properties are lost for low values of M/L=0.2 Msun/Lsun as suggested by\nthe DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is M/L=0.7\nMsun/Lsun at [3.6]. The SPARC data are publicly available and represent an\nideal test-bed for models of galaxy formation.\n", "  A high-performance airborne UV Rayleigh lidar system was developed within the\nEuropean project DELICAT. With its forward-pointing architecture it aims at\ndemonstrating a novel detection scheme for clear air turbulence (CAT) for an\naeronautics safety application. Due to its occurrence in clear and clean air at\nhigh altitudes (aviation cruise flight level), this type of turbulence evades\nmicrowave radar techniques and in most cases coherent Doppler lidar techniques.\nThe present lidar detection technique relies on air density fluctuations\nmeasurement and is thus independent of backscatter from hydrometeors and\naerosol particles. The subtle air density fluctuations caused by the turbulent\nair flow demand exceptionally high stability of the setup and in particular of\nthe detection system. This paper describes an airborne test system for the\npurpose of demonstrating this technology and turbulence detection method: a\nhigh-power UV Rayleigh lidar system is installed on a research aircraft in a\nforward-looking configuration for use in cruise flight altitudes. Flight test\nmeasurements demonstrate this unique lidar system being able to resolve air\ndensity fluctuations occurring in light-to-moderate CAT at 5 km or moderate CAT\nat 10 km distance. A scaling of the determined stability and noise\ncharacteristics shows that such performance is adequate for an application in\ncommercial air transport.\n", "  We report the discovery of five new transiting hot Jupiter planets discovered\nby the HATSouth survey: HATS-31b through HATS-35b. These planets orbit\nmoderately bright stars with V magnitudes within the range 11.9-14.4mag while\nthe planets span a range of masses 0.88-1.22MJ, and have somewhat inflated\nradii between 1.23-1.64RJ.These planets can be classified as typical hot\nJupiters, with HATS-31b and HATS-35b being moderately inflated gas giant\nplanets with radii of $1.64 \\pm 0.22$ RJ and 1.464+0.069-0.044RJ, respectively,\nthat can be used to constrain inflation mechanisms. All five systems present a\nhigher Bayesian evidence for a fixed circular orbit model than for an eccentric\norbit. The orbital periods range from $1.8209993 \\pm 0.0000016$ day for\nHATS-35b) to $3.377960 \\pm 0.000012$ day for HATS-31b. Additionally, HATS-35b\norbits a relatively young F star with an age of $2.13 \\pm 0.51$ Gyr. We discuss\nthe analysis to derive the properties of these systems and compare them in the\ncontext of the sample of well characterized transiting hot Jupiters known to\ndate.\n", "  The anthropic principle is one of the possible explanations for the\ncosmological constant ($\\Lambda$) problem. In previous studies, a dark halo\nmass threshold comparable with our Galaxy must be assumed in galaxy formation\nto get a reasonably large probability of finding the observed small value,\n$P(<$$\\Lambda_{\\rm obs})$, though stars are found in much smaller galaxies as\nwell. Here we examine the anthropic argument by using a semi-analytic model of\ncosmological galaxy formation, which can reproduce many observations such as\ngalaxy luminosity functions. We calculate the probability distribution of\n$\\Lambda$ by running the model code for a wide range of $\\Lambda$, while other\ncosmological parameters and model parameters for baryonic processes of galaxy\nformation are kept constant. Assuming that the prior probability distribution\nis flat per unit $\\Lambda$, and that the number of observers is proportional to\nstellar mass, we find $P(<$$\\Lambda_{\\rm obs}) = 6.7 \\%$ without introducing\nany galaxy mass threshold. We also investigate the effect of metallicity; we\nfind $P(<$$\\Lambda_{\\rm obs}) = 9.0 \\%$ if observers exist only in galaxies\nwhose metallicity is higher than the solar abundance. If the number of\nobservers is proportional to metallicity, we find $P(<$$\\Lambda_{\\rm obs}) =\n9.7 \\%$. Since these probabilities are not extremely small, we conclude that\nthe anthropic argument is a viable explanation, if the value of $\\Lambda$\nobserved in our universe is determined by a probability distribution.\n", "  Recent VLBI observations have resolved Sagittarius A* at horizon scales. The\nEvent Horizon Telescope is expected to provide increasingly good images of the\nregion around the Schwarzschild radius $r_S$ of Sgr A* soon. A number of\nauthors have recently pointed out the possibility that non-perturbative quantum\ngravitational phenomena could affect the space surrounding a black hole. Here\nwe point out that the existence of a region around $\\frac76 r_S$ where these\neffects should be maximal.\n", "  The cross section for the process $e^+e^- \\to \\omega\\eta$ is measured in the\ncenter-of-mass energy range 1.34--2.00 GeV. The analysis is based on data\ncollected with the SND detector at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider. The\nmeasured $e^+e^- \\to \\omega\\eta$ cross section is the most accurate to date. A\nsignificant discrepancy is observed between our data and previous BABAR\nmeasurement.\n", "  We demonstrate an efficient cross-phase modulation (XPM) based on a\nclosed-loop double-{\\Lambda} system. The property of the double-{\\Lambda}\nmedium can be controlled by changing the phases of the applied optical fields.\nThis phase-dependent XPM scheme can achieve large phase modulations at\nlow-light intensities without requiring cavities or tightly focusing of laser\nbeams. With this scheme, we observe a {\\pi}-level phase shift with two pulses\nboth consisting of 8 photons in cold rubidium atoms. Such novel scheme provides\na simple route to generate strong interactions between photons and may have\npotential applications in all-optical quantum signal processing.\n", "  $\\theta$ Cygni is an F3 spectral-type main-sequence star with visual\nmagnitude V=4.48. This star was the brightest star observed by the original\nKepler spacecraft mission. Short-cadence (58.8 s) photometric data using a\ncustom aperture were obtained during Quarter 6 (June-September 2010) and\nsubsequently in Quarters 8 and 12-17. We present analyses of the solar-like\noscillations based on Q6 and Q8 data, identifying angular degree $l$ = 0, 1,\nand 2 oscillations in the range 1000-2700 microHz, with a large frequency\nseparation of 83.9 plus/minus 0.4 microHz, and frequency with maximum amplitude\n1829 plus/minus 54 microHz. We also present analyses of new ground-based\nspectroscopic observations, which, when combined with angular diameter\nmeasurements from interferometry and Hipparcos parallax, give T_eff = 6697\nplus/minus 78 K, radius 1.49 plus/minus 0.03 solar radii, [Fe/H] = -0.02\nplus/minus 0.06 dex, and log g = 4.23 plus/minus 0.03. We calculate stellar\nmodels matching the constraints using several methods, including using the Yale\nRotating Evolution Code and the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal. The best-fit\nmodels have masses 1.35-1.39 solar masses and ages 1.0-1.6 Gyr. theta Cyg's\nT_eff and log g place it cooler than the red edge of the gamma Doradus\ninstability region established from pre-Kepler ground-based observations, but\njust at the red edge derived from pulsation modeling. The pulsation models show\ngamma Dor gravity-mode pulsations driven by the convective-blocking mechanism,\nwith frequencies of 1 to 3 cycles/day (11 to 33 microHz). However, gravity\nmodes were not detected in the Kepler data, one signal at 1.776 cycles/day\n(20.56 microHz) may be attributable to a faint, possibly background, binary.\nAsteroseismic studies of theta Cyg and other A-F stars observed by Kepler and\nCoRoT, will help to improve stellar model physics and to test pulsation driving\nmechanisms.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength investigation of star formation activity towards\nthe southern H II regions associated with IRAS 17160-3707, located at a\ndistance of 6.2 kpc with a bolometric luminosity of 830000 Lsun.The ionised gas\ndistribution and dust clumps in the parental molecular cloud are examined in\ndetail using measurements at infrared, submillimeter and radio wavelengths.The\nradio continuum images at 1280 and 610 MHz obtained using Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope reveal the presence of multiple compact sources as well as nebulous\nemission.At submillimeter wavelengths, we identify seven dust clumps and\nestimate their physical properties like temperature: 24 - 30 K, mass: 300 -\n4800 Msun and luminosity: 900 - 31700 Lsun using modified blackbody fits to the\nspectral energy distributions between 70 and 870 um.We find 24 young stellar\nobjects in the mid-infrared, with few of them coincident with the compact radio\nsources.The spectral energy distributions of young stellar objects have been\nfitted by the Robitaille models and the results indicate that those having\nradio compact sources as counterparts host massive objects in early\nevolutionary stages with best fit age <= 0.2 Myr.We compare the relative\nevolutionary stages of clumps using various signposts such as masers, ionised\ngas, presence of young stellar objects and infrared nebulosity and find six\nmassive star forming clumps and one quiescent clump.Of the former, five are in\na relatively advanced stage and one in an earlier stage.\n", "  We report dynamical mass measurements for the components of the previously\nknown double-lined spectroscopic subdwarfs G 006-026 B and C using the Fine\nGuidance Sensors (FGS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. To build the empirical\nmass-luminosity relation for low metallicity subdwarfs, we collect four other\nsubdwarf systems with dynamical masses that we compare to theoretical models\nfor various metallicities on the mass-luminosity relation. For most stars, they\nfall in the regions where the models predict to be low metallicity. This effort\nhighlights the scarcity of dynamical masses for subdwarfs and that much work\nremains to be done to improve the mass errors and metallicity measurements of\nlow mass subdwarfs in our Galaxy.\n", "  The equivalence principle is the conceptual basis for general relativity. In\ncontrast Mach's principle, although said to have been influential on Einstein\nin his formulation of general relativity, has not been shown to be central to\nthe structure of general relativity. In this essay we suggest that the quantum\neffects of Hawking and Unruh radiation are a manifestation of a {\\it thermal}\nMach's principle, where the local thermodynamic properties of the system are\ndetermined by the non-local structure of the quantum fields which determine the\nvacuum of a given spacetime. By comparing Hawking and Unruh temperatures for\nthe same local acceleration we find a violation of the Einstein elevator\nversion of the equivalence principle, which vanishes in the limit that the\nhorizon is approached.\n", "  We use neutron scattering to compare the magnetic excitations in the hidden\norder (HO) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases in URu2-xFexSi2 as a function of\nFe concentration. The magnetic excitation spectra change significantly between\nx = 0.05 and x = 0.10, following the enhancement of the AFM ordered moment, in\ngood analogy to the behavior of the parent compound under applied pressure.\nProminent lattice-commensurate low-energy excitations characteristic of the HO\nphase vanish in the AFM phase. The magnetic scattering is dominated by strong\nexcitations along the Brillouin zone edges, underscoring the important role of\nelectron hybridization to both HO and AFM phases, and the similarity of the\nunderlying electronic structure. The stability of the AFM phase is correlated\nwith enhanced local-itinerant electron hybridization.\n", "  We study the pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnet with additional positive\nbiquadratic interaction in the semiclassical limit. The classical ground state\nmanifold of the model contains an extensively large family of non-coplanar spin\nstates known as \"color ice states\". Starting from a color ice state, a subset\nof spins may rotate collectively at no energy cost. Such excitation may be\nviewed in this three-dimensional system as a \"membrane-like\" analog of the\nwell-known weathervane modes in the classical kagome Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet. We investigate the weathervane modes in detail and elucidate\ntheir physical properties. Furthermore, we study the order by disorder\nphenomenon in this model, focusing on the role of harmonic fluctuations. Our\ncomputationally-limited phase space search suggests that quantum fluctuations\nselect three different states as the magnitude of the biquadratic interaction\nincreases relative to the bilinear interaction, implying a sequence of phase\ntransitions solely driven by fluctuations.\n", "  We derive a $c-$number Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) describing the\nevolution of the expectation values $\\left\\langle x_{i}\\right\\rangle_{t}$ of\nthe atomic position operators $x_{i}$ of an open system. The latter is coupled\nlinearly to a harmonic bath kept at a fixed temperature. The equations of\nmotion contain a non-Markovian friction term with the classical kernel {[}L.\nKantorovich - PRB 78, 094304 (2008){]} and a zero mean \\emph{non-Gaussian}\nrandom force with correlation functions that depend on the initial preparation\nof the open system. We used a density operator formalism without assuming that\ninitially the combined system was decoupled. The only approximation made in\nderiving quantum GLE consists in assuming that the Hamiltonian of the open\nsystem at time $t$ can be expanded up to the second order with respect to\noperators of atomic displacements $u_{i}=x_{i}-\\left\\langle\nx_{i}\\right\\rangle_{t}$ in the open system around their exact atomic positions\n$\\left\\langle x_{i}\\right\\rangle_{t}$ (the \"harmonisation\" approximation). The\nnoise is introduced to ensure that sampling many quantum GLE trajectories\nyields exactly the average one. An explicit expression for the pair correlation\nfunction of the noise, consistent with the classical limit, is also proposed.\nUnlike the usually considered quantum operator GLE, the proposed $c-$number\nquantum GLE can be used in direct molecular dynamic simulations of open systems\nunder general equilibrium or non-equilibrium conditions.\n", "  We describe a modular multi-channel data acquisition system based on the 5-15\nGigasample-per-second waveform-recording PSEC4 chip. The system architecture\nincorporates two levels of hardware with FPGA-embedded system control and\nin-line data processing. The front-end unit is a 30-channel circuit board that\nholds five PSEC4 ASICs, a clock jitter cleaner, and a control FPGA. The analog\nbandwidth of the front-end signal path is 1.5 GHz. Each channel has an on-chip\nthreshold-level discriminator that is monitored in the FPGA, from which a\nflexible on-board trigger decision can be formed. To instrument larger channel\ncounts, a `back-end' 6U VME32 control card has been designed. Called the\n'Central Card', it incorporates an Altera Arria-V FPGA that manages up to 8\nfront-end cards using one or two CAT5 network cables per board, which transmits\nthe clock and communicates data packets over a custom serial protocol. Data can\nbe read from the Central Card via USB, Ethernet, or dual SFP links, in addition\nto the VME interface. The Central Card can be configured as either Master or\nSlave, allowing one Master to receive data from up to 8 Slaves, with each Slave\nmanaging 8 30-channel front-end cards, allowing a single VME crate to control\nup to 1920 channels of the PSEC4 chip.\n", "  According to Landauer's principle, erasing a memory requires an average work\nof at least $kT\\ln2$ per bit. Recent experiments have confirmed this prediction\nfor a one-bit memory represented by a symmetric double-well potential. Here, we\npresent an experimental study of erasure for a memory encoded in an asymmetric\ndouble-well potential. Using a feedback trap, we find that the average work to\nerase can be less than $kT\\ln2$. Surprisingly, erasure protocols that differ\nsubtly give measurably different values for the asymptotic work, a result we\nexplain by showing that one protocol is symmetric with the respect to time\nreversal, while the other is not. The differences between the protocols help\nclarify the distinctions between thermodynamic and logical reversibility.\n", "  Understanding properties of the first sources in the Universe using the\nredshifted \\HI ~21-cm signal is one of the major aims of present and upcoming\nlow-frequency experiments. We investigate the possibility of imaging the\nredshifted 21-cm pattern around the first sources during the cosmic dawn using\nthe SKA1-low. We model the \\HI ~21-cm image maps, appropriate for the SKA1-low,\naround the first sources consisting of stars and X-ray sources within galaxies.\nIn addition to the system noise, we account also for the astrophysical\nforegrounds by adding them to the signal maps. We find that after subtracting\nthe foregrounds using a polynomial fit and suppressing the noise by smoothing\nthe maps over $10^{'} - 30^{'}$ angular scale, the isolated sources at $z \\sim\n15$ are detectable with $\\sim 4 - 9 \\, \\sigma$ confidence level in 2000 h of\nobservation with the SKA1-low. Although the 21-cm profiles around the sources\nget altered because of the Gaussian smoothing, the images can still be used to\nextract some of the source properties. We account for overlaps in the patterns\nof the individual sources by generating realistic \\HI ~21-cm maps of the cosmic\ndawn that are based on $N$-body simulations and a one-dimensional radiative\ntransfer code. We find that these sources should be detectable in the SKA1-low\nimages at $z = 15$ with an SNR of $\\sim 14 (4)$ in 2000 (200) h of\nobservations. One possible observational strategy thus could be to observe\nmultiple fields for shorter observation times, identify fields with SNR\n$\\gtrsim 3$ and observe these fields for much longer duration. Such\nobservations are expected to be useful in constraining the parameters related\nto the first sources.\n", "  To investigate galaxy properties as a function of their total stellar mass,\nwe obtained 21cm HI line observations at the 100-m class Nan\\c{c}ay Radio\nTelescope of 2839 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in the\nLocal Volume (900<cz<12,000 km/s), dubbed the Nan\\c{c}ay Interstellar Baryons\nLegacy Extragalactic Survey (NIBLES) sample. They were selected evenly over\ntheir entire range of absolute SDSS z-band magnitudes (-13.5 to -24 mag), which\nwere used as a proxy for their stellar masses. Here, a first, global\npresentation of the observations and basic results is given, their further\nanalysis will be presented in other papers in this series. The galaxies were\nselected based on their properties, as listed in SDSS DR5. Comparing this\nphotometry to their total HI masses, we noted that, for a few percent, the SDSS\nmagnitudes appeared severely misunderestimated, as confirmed by our\nre-measurements for selected objects. Although using the later DR9 results\neliminated this problem in most cases, 384 still required manual photometric\nsource selection. Usable HI spectra were obtained for 2600 galaxies, of which\n1733 (67%) were clearly detected and 174 (7%) marginally. The spectra for 241\nother observed galaxies could not be used for further analysis owing to\nproblems with either the HI or the SDSS data. We reached the target number of\nabout 150 sources per half-magnitude bin over the Mz range -16.5 to -23 mag.\nDown to -21 mag the overall detection rate is rather constant at the ~75% level\nbut it starts to decline steadily towards the 30% level at -23 mag. Making\nregression fits by comparing total HI and stellar masses for our sample,\nincluding our conservatively estimated HI upper limits for non-detections, we\nfind the relationship log(M_HI/M*) = -0.59 log(M*) + 5.05, which lies\nsignificantly below the relationship found in the M_HI/M* - M* plane when only\nusing HI detections.\n", "  The partial transpose $\\rho_A^{T_2}$ of the reduced density matrix $\\rho_A$\nis the key object to quantify the entanglement in mixed states, in particular\nthrough the presence of negative eigenvalues in its spectrum. Here we derive\nanalytically the distribution of the eigenvalues of $\\rho_A^{T_2}$, that we dub\nnegativity spectrum, in the ground sate of gapless one-dimensional systems\ndescribed by a Conformal Field Theory (CFT), focusing on the case of two\nadjacent intervals. We show that the negativity spectrum is universal and\ndepends only on the central charge of the CFT, similarly to the entanglement\nspectrum. The precise form of the negativity spectrum depends on whether the\ntwo intervals are in a pure or mixed state, and in both cases, a dependence on\nthe sign of the eigenvalues is found. This dependence is weak for bulk\neigenvalues, whereas it is strong at the spectrum edges. We also investigate\nthe scaling of the smallest (negative) and largest (positive) eigenvalues of\n$\\rho_A^{T_2}$. We check our results against DMRG simulations for the critical\nIsing and Heisenberg chains, and against exact results for the harmonic chain,\nfinding good agreement for the spectrum, but showing that the smallest\neigenvalue is affected by very large scaling corrections.\n", "  F-theory attempts to include all U-dualities manifestly. Unlike its T-dual\nmanifest partner, which is based on string current algebra, F-theory is based\non higher dimensional brane current algebra. Like the T-dual manifest theory,\nwhich has $O(D-1,1)^2$ unbroken symmetry, the F-theory vacuum also enjoys\ncertain symmetries (\"$H$\"). One of its important and exotic properties is that\nworldvolume indices are also spacetime indices. This makes the global brane\ncurrent algebra incompatible with $H$ symmetry currents. The solution is to\nintroduce worldvolume covariant derivatives, which depend on the $H$\ncoordinates even in a \"flat\" background. We will also give as an explicit\nexample the 5-brane case.\n", "  Proxima Centauri is an M dwarf approximately 15,000 AU from the Alpha\nCentauri binary, comoving and likely in a loosely bound orbit. Dynamic\nsimulations show this configuration can form from a more tightly bound triple\nsystem. As our nearest neighbors, these stars command great interest as\npotential planet hosts, and the dynamics of the stars govern the formation of\nany planets within the system. Here we present a scenario for the evolution of\nAlpha Centauri A and B and Proxima Centauri as a triple system. Based on N-body\nsimulations, we determine this pathway to formation is plausible, and we\nquantify the implications for planet formation in the Alpha Centauri binary. We\nexpect this formation scenario may have truncated the circumstellar disk\nslightly more than a system that formed in the current configuration, but that\nit most likely does not prevent terrestrial planet formation. We simulate\nplanet formation in this system and find that in most scenarios, two or more\nterrestrial planets can be expected around either Alpha Centauri A or B,\norbiting in a region out to approximately 2 AU, assuming planetesimals and\nplanetary embryos are able to first form in the system. Additionally,\nterrestrial planet formation and stability in Proxima Centauri's habitable zone\nis also plausible. However, an absence of planets around these stars may be\nindicative of highly disruptive stellar dynamics in the past.\n", "  The cosmological information contained in anisotropic galaxy clustering\nmeasurements can often be compressed into a small number of parameters whose\nposterior distribution is well described by a Gaussian. We present a general\nmethodology to combine these estimates into a single set of consensus\nconstraints that encode the total information of the individual measurements,\ntaking into account the full covariance between the different methods. We\nillustrate this technique by applying it to combine the results obtained from\ndifferent clustering analyses, including measurements of the signature of\nbaryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift-space distortions (RSD), based\non a set of mock catalogues of the final SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our results show that the region of the parameter\nspace allowed by the consensus constraints is smaller than that of the\nindividual methods, highlighting the importance of performing multiple analyses\non galaxy surveys even when the measurements are highly correlated. This paper\nis part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS.\nThe methodology presented here is used in Alam et al. (2016) to produce the\nfinal cosmological constraints from BOSS.\n", "  We explore the cosmological implications of anisotropic clustering\nmeasurements in configuration space of the final galaxy samples from Data\nRelease 12 of the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We\nimplement a new detailed modelling of the effects of non-linearities, galaxy\nbias and redshift-space distortions that can be used to extract unbiased\ncosmological information from our measurements for scales $s \\gtrsim\n20\\,h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$. We combined the galaxy clustering information from BOSS\nwith the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and Type Ia\nsupernovae samples and found no significant evidence for a deviation from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. In particular, these data sets can constrain\nthe dark energy equation of state parameter to $w_{\\rm DE}=-0.996\\pm0.042$ when\nassumed time-independent, the curvature of the Universe to\n$\\Omega_{k}=-0.0007\\pm 0.0030$ and the sum of the neutrino masses to $\\sum\nm_{\\nu} < 0.25\\,{\\rm eV}$ at 95 per cent CL. We explore the constraints on the\ngrowth rate of cosmic structures assuming $f(z)=\\Omega_{\\rm m}(z)^\\gamma$ and\nobtain $\\gamma = 0.609\\pm 0.079$, in good agreement with the predictions of\ngeneral relativity of $\\gamma=0.55$. We compress the information of our\nclustering measurements into constraints on the parameter combinations $D_{\\rm\nV}(z)/r_{\\rm d}$, $F_{\\rm AP}(z)$ and $f\\sigma_8(z)$ at the effective redshifts\nof $z=0.38$, $0.51$ and $0.61$ with their respective covariance matrices and\nfind good agreement with the predictions for these parameters obtained from the\nbest-fitting $\\Lambda$CDM model to the CMB data from the Planck satellite. This\npaper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from\nBOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others\nin Alam et al. (2016) to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.\n", "  In beyond-generalized Proca theories including the extension to theories\nhigher than second order, we study the role of a spatial component $v$ of a\nmassive vector field on the anisotropic cosmological background. We show that,\nas in the case of the isotropic cosmological background, there is no additional\nghostly degrees of freedom associated with the Ostrogradski instability. In\nsecond-order generalized Proca theories we find the existence of anisotropic\nsolutions on which the ratio between the anisotropic expansion rate $\\Sigma$\nand the isotropic expansion rate $H$ remains nearly constant in the\nradiation-dominated epoch. In the regime where $\\Sigma/H$ is constant, the\nspatial vector component $v$ works as a dark radiation with the equation of\nstate close to $1/3$. During the matter era, the ratio $\\Sigma/H$ decreases\nwith the decrease of $v$. As long as the conditions $|\\Sigma| \\ll H$ and $v^2\n\\ll \\phi^2$ are satisfied around the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration,\nwhere $\\phi$ is the temporal vector component, we find that the solutions\napproach the isotropic de Sitter fixed point ($\\Sigma=0=v$) in accordance with\nthe cosmic no-hair conjecture. In the presence of $v$ and $\\Sigma$ the early\nevolution of the dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm DE}$ in the radiation\nera is different from that in the isotropic case, but the approach to the\nisotropic value $w_{\\rm DE}^{{\\rm (iso)}}$ typically occurs at redshifts $z$\nmuch larger than 1. Thus, apart from the existence of dark radiation, the\nanisotropic cosmological dynamics at low redshifts is similar to that in\nisotropic generalized Proca theories. In beyond-generalized Proca theories the\nonly consistent solution to avoid the divergence of a determinant of the\ndynamical system corresponds to $v=0$, so $\\Sigma$ always decreases in time.\n", "  We construct rapidly rotating neutron star models in scalar-tensor theories\nwith a massive scalar field. The fact that the scalar field has nonzero mass\nleads to very interesting results since the allowed range of values of the\ncoupling parameters is significantly broadened. These deviations from pure\ngeneral relativity can be very large for values of the parameters that are in\nagreement with the observations. The rapid rotation can magnify the differences\nseveral times compared to the static case. The universal relations between the\nnormalized moment of inertia and quadrupole moment are also investigated both\nfor the slowly and rapidly rotating cases. The results show that these\nrelations are still EOS independent up to a large extend and the deviations\nfrom pure general relativity can be large. This places the massive\nscalar-tensor theories amongst the few alternative theories of gravity that can\nbe tested via the universal $I$-Love-$Q$ relations.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the evolution of the population-averaged size of\nquenched galaxies (QGs) through a spectroscopic analysis of their stellar ages.\nThe two most favoured scenarios for this evolution are either the size growth\nof individual galaxies through a sequence of dry minor merger events, or the\naddition of larger, newly quenched galaxies to the pre-existing population\n(i.e., a progenitor bias effect). We use the 20k zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic\nsurvey to select bona fide quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. We stack their\nspectra in bins of redshift, stellar mass and size to compute stellar\npopulation parameters in these bins through fits to the rest-frame optical\nspectra and through Lick spectral indices. We confirm a change of behaviour in\nthe size-age relation below and above the ~10^11 MSun stellar mass scale: In\nour 10.5 < log M*/MSun < 11 mass bin, over the entire redshift window, the\nstellar populations of the largest galaxies are systematically younger than\nthose of the smaller counterparts, pointing at progenitor bias as the main\ndriver of the observed average size evolution at sub-10^11 MSun masses. In\ncontrast, at higher masses, there is no clear trend in age as a function of\ngalaxy size, supporting a substantial role of dry mergers in increasing the\nsizes of these most massive QGs with cosmic time. Within the errors, the\n[alpha/Fe] abundance ratios of QGs are (i) above-solar over the entire redshift\nrange of our analysis, hinting at universally short timescales for the buildup\nof the stellar populations of QGs, and (ii) similar at all masses and sizes,\nsuggesting similar (short) timescales for the whole QG population and\nstrengthening the role of mergers in the buildup of the most massive QGs in the\nUniverse.\n", "  We present the first detection of a correlation between the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing. For each Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest in SDSS-III/BOSS DR12, we correlate the one-dimensional power spectrum\nwith the CMB lensing convergence on the same line of sight from Planck. This\nmeasurement constitutes a position-dependent power spectrum, or a squeezed\nbispectrum, and quantifies the non-linear response of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\npower spectrum to a large-scale overdensity. The signal is measured at\n5~$\\sigma$ and is consistent with the $\\Lambda$CDM expectation. We measure the\nlinear bias of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest with respect to the dark matter\ndistribution, and constrain a combination of non-linear terms including the\nnon-linear bias. This new observable provides a consistency check for the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest as a large-scale structure probe and tests our\nunderstanding of the relation between intergalactic gas and dark matter. In the\nfuture, it could be used to test hydrodynamical simulations and calibrate the\nrelation between the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and dark matter.\n", "  We study the impact of a time-dependent external driving of the lattice\nphonons in a minimal model of a BCS superconductor. Upon evaluating the\ndriving-induced vertex corrections of the phonon-mediated electron-electron\ninteraction, we show that parametric phonon driving can be used to elevate the\ncritical temperature $T_c$, while a dipolar phonon drive has no effect. We\nprovide simple analytic expressions for the enhancement factor of $T_c$.\nFurthermore, a mean-field analysis of a nonlinear phonon-phonon interaction\nalso shows that phonon anharmonicities further amplify $T_c$. Our results hold\nuniversally for the large class of normal BCS superconductors.\n", "  Modeling of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole inspiral brings\ntogether early post-Newtonian waveforms and late quasinormal ringing waveforms.\nAttempts to bridge the two limits without recourse to numerical relativity\ninvolve predicting the time of the peak GW amplitude. This prediction will\nrequire solving the question of why the peak of the \"source,\" i.e., the peak of\nthe binary angular velocity, does not correspond to the peak of the GW\namplitude. We show here that this offset can be understood as due to the\nexistence two distinct components of the radiation: the \"direct\" radiation\nanalogous to that in flat spacetime, and \"scattered\" radiation associated with\ncurved spacetime. The time dependence of these two components, and of their\nrelative phases determines the location of the peak amplitude. We use a highly\nsimplified model to clarify the twocomponent nature of the source, then\ndemonstrate that the explanation is valid also for an extreme mass ratio binary\ninspiral.\n", "  In this paper, the first in a series on galaxy formation before reionization,\nwe focus on understanding what determines the size and morphology of stellar\nobjects in the first low mass galaxies, using parsec- scale cosmological\nsimulations performed with an adaptive mesh hydrodynamics code. Although the\ndense gas in which stars are formed tends to have a disk structure, stars are\nfound in spheroids with little rotation. Halos with masses between 10^6 M_sun\nand 5x10^8 M_sun form stars stochastically, with stellar masses in the range\n10^4 M_sun to 2x10^6 M_sun. Nearly independent of stellar mass, we observe a\nlarge range of half-light radii for the stars, from a few parsecs to a few\nhundred parsecs and surface brightnesses and mass-to-light ratios ranging from\nthose typical of globular clusters to ultra-faint dwarfs. In our simulations,\nstars form in dense stellar clusters with high gas-to-star conversion\nefficiencies and rather uniform metallicities. A fraction of these clusters\nremain bound after the gas is removed by feedback, but others are destroyed,\nand their stars, which typically have velocity dispersions of 20 to 40 km/s,\nexpand until they become bound by the dark matter halo. We thus speculate that\nthe stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies may show kinematic and chemical\nsignatures consistent with their origin in a few distinct stellar clusters. On\nthe other hand, some globular clusters may form at the center of primordial\ndwarf galaxies and may contain dark matter, perhaps detectable in the outer\nparts.\n", "  We present a systematic study of vertex corrections in the homogeneous\nelectron gas at metallic densities. The vertex diagrams are built using a\nrecently proposed positive-definite diagrammatic expansion for the spectral\nfunction. The vertex function not only provides corrections to the well known\nplasmon and particle-hole scatterings, but also gives rise to new physical\nprocesses such as generation of two plasmon excitations or the decay of the\none-particle state into a two-particles-one-hole state. By an efficient Monte\nCarlo momentum integration we are able to show that the additional scattering\nchannels are responsible for the bandwidth reduction observed in photoemission\nexperiments on bulk sodium, appearance of the secondary plasmon satellite below\nthe Fermi level, and a substantial redistribution of spectral weights. The\nfeasibility of the approach for first-principles band-structure calculations is\nalso discussed.\n", "  We present a method to identify the coupled, normal modes of a\nsuperconducting transmission-line with an embedded lumped element circuit. We\nevaluate the effective transmission-line non-linearities in the case of\nKerr-like Josephson interactions in the circuit and in the case where the\nembedded circuit constitutes a qubit degree of freedom, which is Rabi coupled\nto the field in the transmission-line. Our theory quantitatively accounts for\nthe very high and positive Kerr non-linearities observed in a recent experiment\n[M. Reh\\'ak et.al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 104, 162604], and we can evaluate the\naccomplishments of modified versions of the experimental circuit.\n", "  The Matter-Neutrino Resonance (MNR) phenomenon has the potential to\nsignificantly alter the flavor content of neutrinos emitted from compact object\nmergers. We present the first calculations of MNR transitions using neutrino\nself interaction potentials and matter potentials generated selfconsistently\nfrom a dynamical model of a three-dimensional neutron star merger. In the\ncontext of the single angle approximation, we find that Symmetric and Standard\nMNR transitions occur in both normal and inverted hierarchy scenarios. We\nexamine the spatial regions above the merger remnant where propagating\nneutrinos will encounter the matter neutrino resonance and find that a\nsignificant fraction of the neutrinos are likely to undergo MNR transitions.\n", "  We report the engineering of the polar magnetooptical (MO) Kerr effect in\nperpendicularly magnetized L10-MnAl epitaxial films with remarkably tuned\nmagnetization, strain, and structural disorder by varying substrate temperature\n(Ts) during molecular-beam epitaxy growth. The Kerr rotation was enhanced by a\nfactor of up to 5 with Ts increasing from 150 to 350 oC as a direct consequence\nof the improvement of the magnetization. A similar remarkable tuning effect was\nalso observed on the Kerr ellipticity and the magnitude of the complex Kerr\nangle, while the phase of the complex Kerr angle appears to be independent of\nthe magnetization. The combination of the good semiconductor compatibility, the\nmoderate coercivity of 0.3-8.2 kOe, the tunable polar MO Kerr effect of up to\n~0.034o, and giant spin procession frequencies of up to ~180 GHz makes L10-MnAl\nfilms a very interesting MO material. Our results give insights on both the\nmicroscopic mechanisms of the MO Kerr effect in L10-MnAl alloys and their\nscientific and technological application potential in the emerging spintronics\nand ultrafast MO modulators.\n", "  Doping a Mott-insulating $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid can lead to a\nfractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*). Such a phase has several favorable features\nthat make it a candidate for the pseudogap metal for the underdoped cuprates.\nWe focus on a particular, simple $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-FL* state which can undergo a\nconfinement transition to a spatially uniform superconductor which is smoothly\nconnected to the `plain vanilla' BCS superconductor with $d$-wave pairing. Such\na transition occurs by the condensation of bosonic particles carrying $+e$\ncharge but no spin (`chargons'). We show that modifying the dispersion of the\nbosonic chargons can lead to confinement transitions with charge density waves\nand pair density waves at the same wave-vector $\\mathbf{K}$, co-existing with\n$d$-wave superconductivity. We also compute the evolution of the Hall number in\nthe normal state during the transition from the plain vanilla FL* state to a\nFermi liquid, and argue, following Coleman, Marston, and Schofield [Phys. Rev.\nB 72, 245111 (2005)], that it exhibits a discontinuous jump near optimal\ndoping. We note the distinction between these results and those obtained from\nmodels of the pseudogap with fermionic chargons.\n", "  Singular sectors $\\mathcal{Z}_{\\mathrm{sing}}$ (loci of zeros) for\nreal-valued non-positively defined partition functions $\\mathcal{Z}$ of $n$\nvariables are studied. It is shown that $\\mathcal{Z}_{\\mathrm{sing}}$ have a\nstratified structure and each stratum is a set of certain hypersurfaces in\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$. The concept of statistical amoebas is introduced and their\nproperties are studied. Relation with algebraic amoebas is discussed. Tropical\nlimit of statistical amoebas is considered too.\n", "  This study examines the relationship between magnetic field complexity and\nmass and angular momentum losses. Observations of open clusters have revealed a\nbimodal distribution of the rotation periods of solar-like stars that has\nproven difficult to explain under the existing rubric of magnetic braking.\nRecent studies suggest that magnetic complexity can play an important role in\ncontrolling stellar spin-down rates. However, magnetic morphology is still\nneglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly\naccounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. Using\nstate-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the\neffect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of\ngeometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates. Angular\nmomentum loss rates depend strongly on the level of complexity of the field but\nare independent of the way this complexity is distributed. We deduce the\nanalytical terms representing the magnetic field morphology dependence of mass\nand angular momentum loss rates. We also define a parameter that best\nrepresents complexity for real stars. As a test, we use these analytical\nmethods to estimate mass and angular momentum loss rates for $8$ stars with\nobserved magnetograms and compare them to the simulated results. Magnetic field\ncomplexity provides a natural physical basis for stellar rotation evolution\nmodels requiring a rapid transition between weak and strong spin-down modes.\n", "  We estimate the conventional astrophysical emission from dwarf spheroidal\nsatellite galaxies (dSphs) of the Milky Way, focusing on millisecond pulsars\n(MSPs), and evaluate the potential for confusion with dark matter (DM)\nannihilation signatures at GeV energies. In low-density stellar environments,\nsuch as dSphs, the abundance of MSPs is expected to be proportional to stellar\nmass. Accordingly, we construct the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity function of MSPs in\nthe Milky Way disk, where $>90$ individual MSPs have been detected with the\n$\\textit{Fermi}$ Large Area Telescope (LAT), and scale this luminosity function\nto the stellar masses of 30 dSphs to estimate the cumulative emission from\ntheir MSP populations. We predict that MSPs within the highest stellar mass\ndSphs, Fornax and Sculptor, produce a $\\gamma$-ray flux $>500$~MeV of\n$\\sim10^{-11}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, which is a factor $\\sim10$ below the\ncurrent LAT sensitivity at high Galactic latitudes. The MSP emission in\nultra-faint dSphs, including targets with the largest J-factors, is typically\nseveral orders of magnitude lower, suggesting that these targets will remain\nclean targets for indirect DM searches in the foreseeable future. For a DM\nparticle of mass 25~GeV annihilating to $b$ quarks at the thermal relic cross\nsection (consistent with DM interpretations of the Galactic Center excess), we\nfind that the expected $\\gamma$-ray emission due to DM exceeds that of MSPs in\nall of the target dSphs. Using the same Milky Way MSP population model, we also\nestimate the Galactic foreground MSP coincidence probability along the same\nsightlines to the dSphs.\n", "  In this work we investigate the classical constraints imposed on the\nsupergravity and super Yang-Mills backgrounds in the $\\alpha'\\to 0$ limit of\nthe heterotic string using the pure spinor formalism. Guided by the recently\nobserved sectorization of the model, we show that all the ten-dimensional\nconstraints are elegantly obtained from the single condition of nilpotency of\nthe BRST charge.\n", "  Molecular vibrational transitions are prime candidates for model-independent\nsearches for variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio. Searches for\npresent-day variation achieve highest sensitivity with deep molecular\npotentials. We identify several high-sensitivity transitions in the deeply\nbound ${\\rm O}_2^+$ molecular ion. These transitions are electric-dipole\nforbidden and thus have narrow linewidths. The most sensitive transitions take\nadvantage of an accidental degeneracy between vibrational states in different\nelectronic potentials. We suggest experimentally feasible routes to a\nmeasurement with uncertainty exceeding current limits on present-day variation\nin $m_p/m_e$.\n", "  We compute the angular dynamics of a neutrally buoyant nearly spherical\nparticle immersed in an unsteady fluid. We assume that the particle is small,\nthat its translational slip velocity is negligible, and that unsteady and\nconvective inertia are small perturbations. We derive an approximation for the\ntorque on the particle that determines the first inertial corrections to\nJeffery's equation. These corrections arise as a consequence of local vortex\nstretching, and can be substantial in turbulence where local vortex stretching\nis strong and closely linked to the irreversibility of turbulence.\n", "  We explore analytically the oscillation quenching phenomena (amplitude death\nand oscillation death) in a coupled third order phase locked loop (PLL) both in\nperiodic and chaotic mode. The phase locked loops are coupled through mean\nfield diffusive coupling. The lower and upper limits of the quenched state are\nidentified in the parameter space of the coupled PLL using Routh-Hurwitz\ntechnique. We further observe that the ability of convergence to the quenched\nstate of coupled PLLs depends on the design parameters. For identical system\nboth the system converges to homogeneous steady state whereas for non-identical\nparameter values they converge to inhomogeneous steady state. It is also\nobserved that for identical systems the quenched state is wider than\nnon-identical case. When the systems parameters are so chosen that each\nisolated loops are chaotic in nature, in that case we observe the quenched\nstate is relatively narrow. All these phenomena are also demonstrated through\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  Strongly interacting systems of dipolar bosons in three dimensions confined\nby harmonic traps are analyzed using the exact Path Integral Ground State Monte\nCarlo method. By adding a repulsive two-body potential, we find a narrow window\nof interaction parameters leading to stable ground- state configurations of\ndroplets in a crystalline arrangement. We find that this effect is entirely due\nto the interaction present in the Hamiltonian without resorting to additional\nstabilizing mechanisms or specific three-body forces. We analyze the number of\ndroplets formed in terms of the Hamiltonian parameters, relate them to the\ncorresponding s-wave scattering length, and discuss a simple scaling model for\nthe density profiles. Our results are in qualitative agreement with recent\nexperiments showing a quantum Rosensweig instability in trapped Dy atoms.\n", "  Measurements of normalized differential cross-sections of top quark pair\n($t\\bar t$) production are presented as a function of the mass, the transverse\nmomentum and the rapidity of the $t\\bar t$ system in proton-proton collisions\nat center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The dataset\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ at 7 TeV and 20.2\nfb$^{-1}$ at 8 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Events with top quark pair signatures are selected in the dilepton\nfinal state, requiring exactly two charged leptons and at least two jets with\nat least one of the jets identified as likely to contain a $b$-hadron. The\nmeasured distributions are corrected for detector effects and selection\nefficiency to cross-sections at the parton level. The differential\ncross-sections are compared with different Monte Carlo generators and\ntheoretical calculations of $t\\bar t$ production. The results are consistent\nwith the majority of predictions in a wide kinematic range.\n", "  We describe the design and performance of the hardware system at the Bleien\nObservatory. The system is designed to deliver a map of the Galaxy for studying\nthe foreground contamination of low-redshift (z=0.13--0.43) H$_{\\rm I}$\nintensity mapping experiments as well as other astronomical Galactic studies.\nThis hardware system is composed of a 7m parabolic dish, a dual-polarization\ncorrugated horn feed, a pseudo correlation receiver, a Fast Fourier Transform\nspectrometer, and an integrated control system that controls and monitors the\nprogress of the data collection. The main innovative designs in the hardware\nare (1) the pseudo correlation receiver and the cold reference source within\n(2) the high dynamic range, high frequency resolution spectrometer and (3) the\nphase-switch implementation of the system. This is the first time these\ntechnologies are used together for a L-band radio telescope to achieve an\nelectronically stable system, which is an essential first step for wide-field\ncosmological measurements. This work demonstrates the prospects and challenges\nfor future H$_{\\rm I}$ intensity mapping experiments.\n", "  We report on high-efficiency superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors\nbased on amorphous WSi and optimized at 1064 nm. At an operating temperature of\n1.8 K, we demonstrated a 93% system detection efficiency at this wavelength\nwith a dark noise of a few counts per second. Combined with cavity-enhanced\nspontaneous parametric down-conversion, this fiber-coupled detector enabled us\nto generate narrowband single photons with a heralding efficiency greater than\n90% and a high spectral brightness of $0.6\\times10^4$\nphotons/(s$\\cdot$mW$\\cdot$MHz). Beyond single-photon generation at large rate,\nsuch high-efficiency detectors open the path to efficient multiple-photon\nheralding and complex quantum state engineering.\n", "  Alternative exact expressions are derived for the minimum error probability\nof a hypothesis test discriminating among $M$ quantum states. The first\nexpression corresponds to the error probability of a binary hypothesis test\nwith certain parameters; the second involves the optimization of a given\ninformation-spectrum measure. Particularized in the classical-quantum channel\ncoding setting, this characterization implies the tightness of two existing\nconverse bounds; one derived by Matthews and Wehner using hypothesis-testing,\nand one obtained by Hayashi and Nagaoka via an information-spectrum approach.\n", "  Non-equilibrium systems lack an explicit characterisation of their steady\nstate like the Boltzmann distribution for equilibrium systems. This has drastic\nconsequences for the inference of parameters of a model when its dynamics lacks\ndetailed balance. Such non-equilibrium systems occur naturally in applications\nlike neural networks or gene regulatory networks. Here, we focus on the\nparadigmatic asymmetric Ising model and show that we can learn its parameters\nfrom independent samples of the non-equilibrium steady state. We present both\nan exact inference algorithm and a computationally more efficient, approximate\nalgorithm for weak interactions based on a systematic expansion around\nmean-field theory. Obtaining expressions for magnetisations, two- and\nthree-point spin correlations, we establish that these observables are\nsufficient to infer the model parameters. Further, we discuss the symmetries\ncharacterising the different orders of the expansion around the mean field and\nshow how different types of dynamics can be distinguished on the basis of\nsamples from the non-equilibrium steady state.\n", "  We investigate the expected cosmological constraints from a combination of\nweak lensing and large-scale galaxy clustering using realistic redshift\ndistributions. Introducing a systematic bias in the weak lensing redshift\ndistributions (of 0.05 in redshift) produces a $>2\\sigma$ bias in the recovered\nmatter power spectrum amplitude and dark energy equation of state, for\npreliminary Stage III surveys. We demonstrate that these cosmological errors\ncan be largely removed by marginalising over unknown biases in the assumed weak\nlensing redshift distributions, if we assume high quality redshift information\nfor the galaxy clustering sample. Furthermore the cosmological constraining\npower is mostly retained despite removing much of the information on the weak\nlensing redshift distribution biases. We show that this comes from\ncomplementary degeneracy directions between cosmic shear and the combination of\ngalaxy clustering with cross-correlation between shear and galaxy number\ndensity. Finally we examine how the self-calibration performs when the assumed\ndistributions differ from the true distributions by more than a simple uniform\nbias. We find that the effectiveness of this self-calibration method will\ndepend on the details of a given experiment and the nature of the uncertainties\non the estimated redshift distributions.\n", "  We investigate the static $Q\\bar{Q}$ potential at zero and finite temperature\nin the presence of a constant and uniform external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$,\nfor several values of the lattice spacing and for different orientations with\nrespect to $\\vec{B}$. As a byproduct, we provide continuum limit extrapolated\nresults for the string tension, the Coulomb coupling and the Sommer parameter\nat $T = 0$ and $B = 0$. We confirm the presence in the continuum of a\n$B$-induced anisotropy, regarding essentially the string tension, for which it\nis of the order of 15\\% at $|e| B \\sim 1~{\\rm GeV}^2$ and would suggest, if\nextrapolated to larger fields, a vanishing string tension along the magnetic\nfield for $|e| B \\gtrsim 4$ GeV$^2$. The angular dependence for $|e| B \\lesssim\n1$ GeV$^2$ can be nicely parametrized by the first allowed term in an angular\nFourier expansion, corresponding to a quadrupole deformation. Finally, for $T\n\\neq 0$, the main effect of the magnetic field is a general suppression of the\nstring tension, leading to a precocious loss of the confining properties: this\nhappens even before the appearance of inverse magnetic catalysis in the chiral\ncondensate, supporting the idea that the influence of the magnetic field on the\nconfining properties is the leading effect originating the decrease of $T_c$ as\na function of $B$.\n", "  We describe the dynamical evolution of a unique type of dark star cluster\nmodel in which the majority of the cluster mass at Hubble time is dominated by\nan intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). We analyzed results from about 2000\nstar cluster models (Survey Database I) simulated using the Monte-Carlo code\nMOCCA and identified these dark star cluster models. Taking one of these\nmodels, we apply the method of simulating realistic \"mock observations\" by\nutilizing the COCOA and SISCO codes to obtain the photometric and kinematic\nobservational properties of the dark star cluster model at 12 Gyr. We find that\nthe perplexing Galactic globular cluster NGC 6535 closely matches the\nobservational photometric and kinematic properties of the dark star cluster\nmodel presented in this paper. Based on our analysis and currently observed\nproperties of NGC 6535, we suggest that this globular cluster could potentially\nharbour an IMBH. If it exists, the presence of this IMBH can be detected\nrobustly with proposed kinematic observations of NGC 6535.\n", "  This paper presents the first major data release and survey description for\nthe ANU WiFeS SuperNovA Program (AWSNAP). AWSNAP is an ongoing supernova\nspectroscopy campaign utilising the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the\nAustralian National University (ANU) 2.3m telescope. The first and primary data\nrelease of this program (AWSNAP-DR1) releases 357 spectra of 175 unique objects\ncollected over 82 equivalent full nights of observing from July 2012 to August\n2015. These spectra have been made publicly available via the WISeREP supernova\nspectroscopy repository. We analyse the AWSNAP sample of Type Ia supernova\nspectra, including measurements of narrow sodium absorption features afforded\nby the high spectral resolution of the WiFeS instrument. In some cases we were\nable to use the integral-field nature of the WiFeS instrument to measure the\nrotation velocity of the SN host galaxy near the SN location in order to obtain\nprecision sodium absorption velocities. We also present an extensive time\nseries of SN 2012dn, including a near-nebular spectrum which both confirms its\n\"super-Chandrasekhar\" status and enables measurement of the sub-solar host\nmetallicity at the SN site.\n", "  We investigate how observations of the lepton flavor violating decay of the\nHiggs boson ($h \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime$) can narrow down models of neutrino mass\ngeneration mechanisms, which were systematically studied in Refs. [1,2] by\nfocusing on the combination of new Yukawa coupling matrices with leptons. We\nfind that a wide class of models for neutrino masses can be excluded if\nevidence for $h \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime$ is really obtained in the current or\nfuture collider experiments. In particular, simple models of Majorana neutrino\nmasses cannot be compatible with the observation of $h \\to \\ell\\ell^\\prime$. It\nis also found that some of the simple models to generate masses of Dirac\nneutrinos radiatively can be compatible with a significant rate of the $h \\to\n\\ell\\ell^\\prime$ process.\n", "  Previous literature suggests that the densest structures in the interstellar\nmedium form through colliding flows, but patent evidence of this process is\nstill missing. Recent literature proposes using SiO line emission to trace\nlow-velocity shocks associated with cloud formation through collision. In this\npaper we investigate the bright and extended SiO(2-1) emission observed along\nthe ~5 pc-long W43-MM1 ridge to determine its origin. We used high angular\nresolution images of the SiO(2-1) and HCN(1-0) emission lines obtained with the\nIRAM plateau de Bure (PdBI) interferometer and combined with data from the IRAM\n30 m radiotelescope. These data were complemented by a Herschel column density\nmap of the region. We performed spectral analysis of SiO and HCN emission line\nprofiles to identify protostellar outflows and spatially disentangle two\nvelocity components associated with low- and high-velocity shocks. Then, we\ncompared the low-velocity shock component to a dedicated grid of\none-dimensional (1D) radiative shock models. We find that the SiO emission\noriginates from a mixture of high-velocity shocks caused by bipolar outflows\nand low-velocity shocks. Using SiO and HCN emission lines, we extract seven\nbipolar outflows associated with massive dense cores previously identified\nwithin the W43-MM1 mini-starburst cluster. Comparing observations with\ndedicated Paris-Durham shock models constrains the velocity of the low-velocity\nshock component from 7 to 12km/s. The SiO arising from low-velocity shocks\nspreads along the complete length of the ridge. Its contribution represents at\nleast 45% and up to 100% of the total SiO emission depending on the area\nconsidered. The low-velocity component of SiO is most likely associated with\nthe ridge formation through colliding flows or cloud-cloud collision.\n", "  The inner regions of the envelopes surrounding young protostars are\ncharacterised by a complex chemistry, with prebiotic molecules present on the\nscales where protoplanetary disks eventually may form. This paper introduces a\nsystematic survey, \"Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS)\" of the\nClass 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The survey covers the full frequency\nrange from 329 to 363 GHz (0.8 mm) with additional targeted observations at 3.0\nand 1.3 mm. More than 10,000 features are detected toward one component in the\nprotostellar binary. Glycolaldehyde, its isomers, methyl formate and acetic\nacid, and its reduced alcohol, ethylene glycol, are clearly detected. For\nethylene glycol both lowest state conformers, aGg' and gGg', are detected, the\nlatter for the first time in the ISM. The abundance of glycolaldehyde is\ncomparable to or slightly larger than that of ethylene glycol. In comparison to\nthe Galactic Center, these two species are over-abundant relative to methanol,\npossibly an indication of formation at low temperatures in CO-rich ices. Both\n13C and deuterated isotopologues of glycolaldehyde are detected, also for the\nfirst time ever in the ISM. For the deuterated species, a D/H ratio of\napproximately 5% is found with no differences between the deuteration in the\ndifferent functional groups of glycolaldehyde. Measurements of the 13C-species\nlead to a 12C:13C ratio of approximately 30, lower than the typical ISM value.\nThis low ratio may reflect an enhancement of 13CO in the ice due to either\nion-molecule reactions in the gas before freeze-out or differences in the\ntemperatures where 12CO and 13CO ices sublimate. The results reinforce the\nimportance of low-temperature grain surface chemistry for the formation of\nprebiotic molecules seen here in the gas after sublimation of the entire ice\nmantle.\n", "  The bandstructure of bulk silicon has a six-fold valley degeneracy. Strain in\nthe Si/SiGe quantum well system partially lifts the valley degeneracy, but the\nmaterials factors that set the splitting of the two lowest lying valleys are\nstill under intense investigation. We propose a method for accurately\ndetermining the valley splitting in Si/SiGe double quantum dots embedded into a\nsuperconducting microwave resonator. We show that low lying valley states in\nthe double quantum dot energy level spectrum lead to readily observable\nfeatures in the cavity transmission. These features generate a \"fingerprint\" of\nthe microscopic energy level structure of a semiconductor double quantum dot,\nproviding useful information on valley splittings and intervalley coupling\nrates.\n", "  We investigated optical spin orientation and dynamic nuclear polarization\n(DNP) in individual self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) doped by a\nsingle Mn atom, a magnetic impurity providing a neutral acceptor A$^0$ with an\neffective spin $J=1$. We find that the spin of an electron photo-created in\nsuch a quantum dot can be efficiently oriented by a quasi-resonant\ncircularly-polarized excitation. For the electron spin levels which are made\nquasi-degenerate by a magnetic field compensating the exchange interaction\n$\\Delta_e$ with A$^0$, there is however a full depolarization due the\nanisotropic part of the exchange. Still, in most studied QDs, the spin\npolarized photo-electrons give rise to a pronounced DNP which grows with a\nlongitudinal magnetic field until a critical field where it abruptly vanishes.\nFor some QDs, several replica of such DNP sequence are observed at different\nmagnetic fields. This striking behavior is qualitatively discussed as a\nconsequence of different exchange interactions experienced by the electron,\ndriving the DNP rate via the energy cost of electron-nucleus spin flip-flops.\n", "  We propose a novel mechanism for production of baryonic asymmetry in the\nearly Universe. The mechanism takes advantage of the strong first order phase\ntransition that produces runaway bubbles in the hidden sector that propagate\nalmost without friction with ultra-relativistic velocities. Collisions of such\nbubbles can non-thermally produce heavy particles that further decay\nout-of-equilibrium into the SM and produce the observed baryonic asymmetry.\nThis process can proceed at the very low temperatures, providing a new\nmechanism of post-sphaleron baryogenesis. In this paper we present a fully\ncalculable model which produces the baryonic asymmetry along these lines as\nwell as evades all the existing cosmological constraints. We emphasize that the\nGravitational Waves signal from the first order phase transition is completely\ngeneric and can potentially be detected by the future eLISA interferometer. We\nalso discuss other potential signals, which are more model dependent, and point\nout the unresolved theoretical questions related to our proposal.\n", "  The effect of thermal fluctuations near a contact line of a liquid interface\npartially wetting an impenetrable substrate is studied analytically and\nnumerically. Promoting both the interface profile and the contact line position\nto random variables, we explore the equilibrium properties of the corresponding\nfluctuating contact line problem based on an interfacial Hamiltonian involving\na \"contact\" binding potential. To facilitate an analytical treatment we\nconsider the case of a one-dimensional interface. The effective boundary\ncondition at the contact line is determined by a dimensionless parameter that\nencodes the relative importance of thermal energy and substrate energy at the\nmicroscopic scale. We find that this parameter controls the transition from a\npartially wetting to a pseudo-partial wetting state, the latter being\ncharacterized by a thin prewetting film of fixed thickness. In the partial\nwetting regime, instead, the profile typically approaches the substrate via an\nexponentially thinning prewetting film. We show that, independently of the\nphysics at the microscopic scale, Young's angle is recovered sufficiently far\nfrom the substrate. The fluctuations of the interface and of the contact line\ngive rise to an effective disjoining pressure, exponentially decreasing with\nheight. Fluctuations therefore provide a regularization of the singular contact\nforces occurring in the corresponding deterministic problem.\n", "  We present results derived from the first multi-chord stellar occultation by\nthe trans-Neptunian object (229762) 2007 UK$_{126}$, observed on 2014 November\n15. The event was observed by the Research and Education Collaborative\nOccultation Network (RECON) project and International Occultation Timing\nAssociation (IOTA) collaborators throughout the United States. Use of two\ndifferent data analysis methods obtain a satisfactory fit to seven chords,\nyelding an elliptical fit to the chords with an equatorial radius of\n$R=338_{-10} ^{+15}$ km and equivalent radius of $R_{eq}=319_{-7} ^{+14}$ km. A\ncircular fit also gives a radius of $R=324_{-23} ^{+30}$ km. Assuming that the\nobject is a Maclaurin spheroid with indeterminate aspect angle, and using two\npublished absolute magnitudes for the body, we derive possible ranges for\ngeometric albedo between $p_{V}=0.159_{-0.013} ^{+0.007}$ and\n$p_{R}=0.189_{-0.015}^{+0.009}$, and for the body oblateness between\n$\\epsilon=0.105_{-0.040} ^{+0.050}$ and $\\epsilon=0.118_{-0.048} ^{+0.055}$.\nFor a nominal rotational period of 11.05 h, an upper limit for density of\n$\\rho=1740$ kg~m$^{-3}$ is estimated for the body.\n", "  We present a geomorphologic map of Titan's polar terrains. The map was\ngenerated from a combination of Cassini Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and\nImaging Science Subsystem imaging products, as well as altimetry, SARTopo and\nradargrammetry topographic datasets. In combining imagery with topographic\ndata, our geomorphologic map reveals a stratigraphic sequence from which we\ninfer process interactions between units. In mapping both polar regions with\nthe same geomorphologic units, we conclude that processes that formed the\nterrains of the north polar region also acted to form the landscape we observe\nat the south. Uniform, SAR-dark plains are interpreted as sedimentary deposits,\nand are bounded by moderately dissected uplands. These plains contain the\nhighest density of filled and empty lake depressions, and canyons. These units\nunconformably overlay a basement rock that outcrops as mountains and SAR-bright\ndissected terrains at various elevations across both poles. All these units are\nthen superposed by surficial units that slope towards the seas, suggestive of\nsubsequent overland transport of sediment. From estimates of the depths of the\nembedded empty depressions and canyons that drain into the seas, the SAR-dark\nplains must be >600 m thick in places, though the thickness may vary across the\npoles. At the lowest elevations of each polar region, there are large seas,\nwhich are currently liquid methane/ethane filled at the north and empty at the\nsouth. The large plains deposits and the surrounding hillslopes may represent\nremnant landforms that are a result of previously vast polar oceans, where\nlarger liquid bodies may have allowed for a sustained accumulation of soluble\nand insoluble sediments, potentially forming layered sedimentary deposits.\nCoupled with vertical crustal movements, the resulting layers would be of\nvarying solubilities and erosional resistances.\n", "  We report a new energy conservation law for time-harmonic electromagnetic\nfields, which is valid for an arbitrary medium. In contrast to the\nwell-established Poynting theorem for time-harmonic fields, the real part of\nthe new energy conservation law gives an equation for the sum of stored\nelectric and magnetic field energies and the imaginary part involves an\nequation related to the difference between the dissipated electric and magnetic\nenergies. Universally applicable expressions for both the electric and magnetic\nfield energies have been obtained and demonstrated to be valuable in\ncharacterizing the energy storage and transport properties in complex media.\nFor a lossless isotropic and homogeneous medium, the new energy conservation\nlaw implies that the stored electromagnetic field energy of a radiating system\nenclosed by a surface is equal to the total field energy inside the surface\nsubtracted by the energy flowing out of the surface.\n", "  A method we developed recently for the reconstruction of the initial density\nfield in the nearby Universe is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 7. A high-resolution N-body constrained simulation (CS) of the\nreconstructed initial condition, with $3072^3$ particles evolved in a 500 Mpc/h\nbox, is carried out and analyzed in terms of the statistical properties of the\nfinal density field and its relation with the distribution of SDSS galaxies. We\nfind that the statistical properties of the cosmic web and the halo populations\nare accurately reproduced in the CS. The galaxy density field is strongly\ncorrelated with the CS density field, with a bias that depend on both galaxy\nluminosity and color. Our further investigations show that the CS provides\nrobust quantities describing the environments within which the observed\ngalaxies and galaxy systems reside. Cosmic variance is greatly reduced in the\nCS so that the statistical uncertainties can be controlled effectively even for\nsamples of small volumes.\n", "  The $1s$ level shift in kaonic deuterium was calculated using Coulomb\nSturmian expansion of Faddeev equations. The convergence of the method yields\nan $\\sim\\ 1\\ eV$ accuracy for the level shifts. We used three different,\nrealistic, multichannel $\\bar{K}N$ interactions reproducing all known\nexperimental two-body $\\bar{K}N$ data. The different results suggest, that the\nlevel shift should be in the range $\\Delta E\\sim(800\\pm30)-(480\\pm20){\\rm i}\\ \\\neV$. The (almost) exact level shifts were compared with values, given by the\ncommonly used approximations.\n", "  In the year 2013, Danan et al. published a paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n240402 (2013)] demonstrating a counterintuitive behavior of photons in nested\nMach-Zehnder interferometers. The authors then proposed an explanation based on\nthe two-state vector formalism. This experiment and the authors' explanation\nraised a vivid debate within the scientific community. In this paper, we\ncontribute to the ongoing debate by presenting an alternative experimental\nimplementation of the Danan et al. scheme. We show that no counterintuitive\nbehavior is observed when performing direct spectrally-resolved detection.\n", "  A computationally quick and conceptually simple method to recover time delay\nof the chaotic system from scalar time series is developed in this paper. We\nshow that the orbits in the incomplete two-dimensional reconstructed\nphase-space will show local clustering phenomenon after the component\npermutation procedure proposed in this work. We find that information captured\nby the incomplete two-dimensional reconstructed phase-space, is related to the\ntime delay ${\\tau _0}$ present in the system, and will be transferred to the\npermutation component by the procedure of component permutation. We then\npropose the segmented mean-variance (SMV) from the permutation component to\nidentify the time delay ${\\tau _0}$ of the system. The proposed SMV shows clear\nmaximum when the embedding delay $\\tau $ of the incomplete reconstruction\nmatches the time delay ${\\tau _0}$ of the chaotic system. Numerical data\ngenerated by a time-delay system based on the Mackey-Glass equation operating\nin the chaotic regime are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nSMV. Experimental results show that the proposed SMV is robust to additive\nobservational noise and is able to recover the time delay of the chaotic system\neven though the amount of data is relatively small and the feedback strength is\nweak. Moreover, the time complexity of the proposed method is quite low.\n", "  ALMA observations in the CO 1 - 0 line of the interacting galaxies IC 2163\nand NGC 2207 at 2\" x 1.5\" resolution reveal how the encounter drives gas to\npile up in narrow, ~ 1 kpc wide, \"eyelids\" in IC 2163. IC 2163 and NGC 2207 are\ninvolved in a grazing encounter, which has led to development in IC 2163 of an\neye-shaped (ocular) structure at mid-radius and two tidal arms. The CO data\nshow that there are large velocity gradients across the width of each eyelid,\nwith a mixture of radial and azimuthal streaming of gas at the outer edge of\nthe eyelid relative to its inner edge. The sense of the radial streaming in the\neyelids is consistent with the idea that gas from the outer part of IC 2163\nflows inward until its radial streaming slows down abruptly and the gas piles\nup in the eyelids. The radial compression at the eyelids causes an increase in\nthe gas column density by direct radial impact and also leads to a high rate of\nshear. We find a strong correlation between the molecular column densities and\nthe magnitude of dv/dR across the width of the eyelid at fixed values of\nazimuth. Substantial portions of the eyelids have high velocity dispersion in\nCO, indicative of elevated turbulence there.\n", "  We report the first measurements of the effect of pressure on vibrational\nmodes in emulsions, which serve as a model for soft frictionless spheres at\nzero temperature. As a function of the applied pressure, we find that the\ndensity of states D(omega) exhibits a low-frequency cutoff omega*, which scales\nlinearly with the number of extra contacts per particle dz. Moreover, for\nomega<omega*, D(omega)~ omega^2/omega*^2; a quadratic behavior whose prefactor\nis larger than what is expected from Debye theory. This surprising result\nagrees with recent theoretical findings. Finally, the degree of localization of\nthe softest low frequency modes increases with compression, as shown by the\nparticipation ratio as well as their spatial configurations. Overall, our\nobservations show that emulsions are marginally stable and display\nnon-plane-wave modes up to vanishing frequencies.\n", "  We present analytic results for the three-loop static potential of two heavy\nquarks. The analytic calculation of the missing ingredients is outlined and\nresults for the singlet and octet potential are provided.\n", "  We investigate potential for measuring CP state of the Higgs boson in the H\nto tau tau$ decay with consecutive tau-lepton decays in channels: tau^+- to\nrho^+- nu_tau and tau^+- to a1^+- nu_tau combined. Subsequent decays rho^+- to\npi^+- pi^0, a1^+- to rho^0 pi^+- and rho^0 to pi^+ pi^- are taken into account.\nWe will explore extensions of the method, where acoplanarity angle for the\nplanes build on the visible decay products, pi^+- pi^0 of tau^+- to pi^pm pi^0\nnu_tau, was used. The angle is sensitive to transverse spin correlations, thus\nto parity.\n  We show, that in the case of the cascade decays of tau to a1 nu, information\non the CP state of Higgs can be extracted from the acoplanarity angles as well.\nBecause in the cascade decay a1^+- to rho^0 pi^pm,rho^0 to pi^+ pi^- up to four\nplanes can be defined, up to 16 distinct acoplanarity angles are available for\nH \\to tau tau to a1^+ a1^- nu nu decays. These acoplanarities carry in part\nsupplementary but also correlated information. It is thus cumbersome to\nevaluate an overall sensitivity.\n  We investigate sensitivity potential of such analysis, by developing and\nimplementing model in the Machine Learning (ML) techniques. We quantify\npossible improvements when multi-dimensional phase-space of outgoing decay\nproducts directions is used, instead of 1-dimensional projections i.e. the\nacoplanarity angles.\n  We do not take into account ambiguities resulting from detector uncertainties\nor background contamination, we concentrate on usefulness of ML methods and tau\nto 3pi nu decays for Higgs boson parity measurement.\n", "  For a massive quantum fermionic field, we investigate the vacuum expectation\nvalues (VEVs) of the charge and current densities induced by an external\nmagnetic flux in a two-dimensional circular ring. Both the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra. We show that, unlike the VEVs in the boundary-free geometry, the\nvacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the\nmagnetic flux and vanish for half-odd integer values of the flux in units of\nthe flux quantum. Combining the results for two irreducible representations, we\nalso investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time-reversal\nsymmetric models. The corresponding results are applied to graphene rings with\nthe electronic subsystem described in terms of the effective Dirac theory with\nthe energy gap. If the energy gaps for two valleys of the graphene hexagonal\nlattice are the same, the charge densities corresponding to the separate\nvalleys cancel each other, whereas the azimuthal current is doubled.\n", "  The total spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter in the presence of\nan infinite MoS\\textsubscript{2} monolayer is enhanced by several orders of\nmagnitude, compared to its free-space value, due to the excitation of surface\nexciton polariton modes and lossy modes. The spectral and distance dependence\nof the spontaneous emission rate are analyzed and the lossy-surface-wave,\nsurface exciton polariton mode and radiative contributions are identified. The\ntransverse magnetic and transverse electric exciton polariton modes can be\nexcited for different emission frequencies of the quantum emitter, and their\ncontributions to the total spontaneous emission rate are different. To\ncalculate these different decay rates, we use the non-Hermitian description of\nlight-matter interactions, employing a Green's tensor formalism. The distance\ndependence follows different trends depending on the emission energy of quantum\nemitter. For the case of the lossy surface waves, the distance dependence\nfollows a $z^{-n}$, $n=2,3,4$, trend. When transverse magnetic exciton\npolariton modes are excited, they dominate and characterize the distance\ndependence of the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter in the\npresence of the MoS\\textsubscript{2} layers. The interaction between a quantum\nemitter and a MoS\\textsubscript{2} superlattice is investigated and we observe\na splitting of the modes supported by the superlattice. Moreover, a blue shift\nof the peak values of the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter is\nobserved as the number of layers is increased. The field distribution profiles,\ncreated by a quantum emitter, are used to explain this behavior.\n", "  We present far-infrared images of the Galactic oxygen-rich supernova remnant\n(SNR) G292.0+1.8, acquired with the PACS and SPIRE instruments of the Herschel\nSpace Observatory. We find that the SNR shell is detected in the PACS blue (100\nmicron) band, but not in the red (160 micron) band, broadly consistent with\nresults from AKARI observations. There is no discernible emission from\nG292.0+1.8 in SPIRE imagery at 250, 350 and 500 micron. Comparing the 100\nmicron emission to that observed with Spitzer, at 24 and 70 micron, we find a\nvery similar appearance for G292.0+1.8 at all three wavelengths. The IR\nemission is dominated by dust from non-radiative circumstellar shocks. In\naddition, the radiatively shocked O-rich clump known as the 'Spur' on the\neastern side of G292.0+1.8, is clearly detected in the PACS blueimages, with\nmarginal detection in the red. Fitting the existing 14-40 micron IRS spectra of\nthe Spur together with photometric measurements from 70 micron MIPS and 100\nmicron PACS photometry, we place an upper limit of <~ 0.04 solar masses, of\nejecta dust mass in the Spur, under the most conservative assumption that the\nejecta dust has a temperature of 15 K. Modeling the dust continuum in the IRS\nspectra at four positions around the rim, we estimate postshock densities\nranging from n_p = 3.5 cm^-3 to 11 cm^-3. The integrated spectrum of the entire\nSNR, dominated by swept up circumstellar dust, can be fit with a two-component\ndust model with a silicate component at 62 K and graphite component at 40 K for\na total dust mass of 0.023 solar masses.\n", "  Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are classified into long and short categories based\non their durations. Broad band studies suggest that these two categories of\nobjects roughly correspond to two different classes of progenitor systems, i.e.\ncompact star mergers (Type I) vs. massive star core collapse (Type II).\nHowever, the duration criterion sometimes leads to mis-identification of the\nprogenitor systems. We perform a comprehensive multi-wavelength comparative\nstudy between duration-defined long GRBs and short GRBs as well as the\nso-called \"consensus\" long GRBs and short GRBs (which are believed to be more\nclosely related to the two types of progenitor systems). The parameters we\nstudy include two parts: the prompt emission properties including duration\n($T_{90}$), spectral peak energy ($E_{\\rm p}$), low energy photon index\n($\\alpha$), isotropic $\\gamma$-ray energy ($E_{\\rm \\gamma, iso}$), isotropic\npeak luminosity ($L_{\\rm p,iso}$), and the amplitude parameters ($f$ and\n$f_{\\rm eff}$); and the host galaxy properties including stellar mass ($M_*$),\nstar formation rate (SFR), metallicity ([X/H]), half light radius ($R_{50}$),\nangular and physical ($R_{\\rm off}$) offset of the afterglow from the center of\nthe host galaxy, the normalized offset ($r_{\\rm off}=R_{\\rm off}/R_{50}$), and\nthe brightness fraction $F_{\\rm light}$. For most parameters, we find\ninteresting overlapping properties between the two populations in both 1D and\n2D distribution plots. The three best parameters for the classification purpose\nare $T_{90}$, $f_{\\rm eff}$, and $F_{\\rm light}$. However, no single parameter\nalone is good enough to place a particular burst into the right physical\ncategory, suggesting a need of multiple criteria for physical classification.\n", "  In this paper we proceed with the study of the Pomeron spectrum, by solving\nnumerically the BFKL equation with massive gluons and running coupling. The\nspectrum of Regge singularities is discrete and the leading Pomeron has a\nconsiderable dependence on nonperturbative effects, for which we use Higgs\nmechanism as a model. We cross-checked this result with variational method and\nconfirmed the infrared sensitivity of leading Pomeron. This fact is related to\nthe infrared instability of the BFKL equation in QCD, with a running coupling.\nThe subleading poles have a mild sensitivity to the soft physics, and are well\ndescribed by known semiclassical methods. We also discuss the dependence on\nvarious prescriptions of the running coupling arguments.\n", "  Ponderomotive acceleration has been asserted to be a cause of the First\nIonization Potential (FIP) effect, the by now well known enhancement in\nabundance by a factor of 3-4 over photospheric values of elements in the solar\ncorona with FIP less than about 10 eV. It is shown here by means of numerical\nsimulations that ponderomotive acceleration occurs in solar coronal loops, with\nthe appropriate magnitude and direction, as a \"byproduct\" of coronal heating.\nThe numerical simulations are performed with the HYPERION code, which solves\nthe fully compressible three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations\nincluding nonlinear thermal conduction and optically thin radiation. Numerical\nsimulations of a coronal loops with an axial magnetic field from 0.005 Teslas\nto 0.02 Teslas and lengths from 25000 km to 75000 km are presented. In the\nsimulations the footpoints of the axial loop magnetic field are convected by\nrandom, large-scale motions. There is a continuous formation and dissipation of\nfield-aligned current sheets which act to heat the loop. As a consequence of\ncoronal magnetic reconnection, small scale, high speed jets form. The familiar\nvortex quadrupoles form at reconnection sites. Between the magnetic footpoints\nand the corona the reconnection flow merges with the boundary flow. It is in\nthis region that the ponderomotive acceleration occurs. Mirroring the character\nof the coronal reconnection, the ponderomotive acceleration is also found to be\nintermittent.\n", "  Coronal loops trace out bipolar, arch-like magnetic fields above the Sun's\nsurface. Recent measurements that combine rotational tomography, extreme\nultraviolet imaging, and potential-field extrapolation have shown the existence\nof large loops with inverted temperature profiles; i.e., loops for which the\napex temperature is a local minimum, not a maximum. These \"down loops\" appear\nto exist primarily in equatorial quiet regions near solar minimum. We simulate\nboth these and the more prevalent large-scale \"up loops\" by modeling coronal\nheating as a time-steady superposition of: (1) dissipation of incompressible\nAlfven-wave turbulence, and (2) dissipation of compressive waves formed by mode\nconversion from the initial population of Alfven waves. We found that when a\nlarge percentage (> 99%) of the Alfven waves undergo this conversion, heating\nis greatly concentrated at the footpoints and stable \"down loops\" are created.\nIn some cases we found loops with three maxima that are also gravitationally\nstable. Models that agree with the tomographic temperature data exhibit higher\ngas pressures for \"down loops\" than for \"up loops,\" which is consistent with\nobservations. These models also show a narrow range of Alfven wave amplitudes:\n3 to 6 km/s at the coronal base. This is low in comparison to typical observed\namplitudes of 20 to 30 km/s in bright X-ray loops. However, the large-scale\nloops we model are believed to comprise a weaker diffuse background that fills\nmuch of the volume of the corona. By constraining the physics of loops that\nunderlie quiescent streamers, we hope to better understand the formation of the\nslow solar wind.\n", "  We discuss 6 GHz JVLA observations covering a volume-limited sample of 178\nlow redshift ($0.2 < z < 0.3$) optically selected QSOs. Our 176 radio\ndetections fall into two clear categories: (1) About $20$\\% are radio-loud QSOs\n(RLQs) having spectral luminosities $L_6 \\gtrsim 10^{\\,23.2}\n\\mathrm{~W~Hz}^{-1}$ primarily generated in the active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nresponsible for the excess optical luminosity that defines a \\emph{bona fide}\nQSO. (2) The radio-quiet QSOs (RQQs) have $10^{\\,21} \\lesssim L_6 \\lesssim\n10^{\\,23.2} \\mathrm{~W~Hz}^{-1}$ and radio sizes $\\lesssim 10 \\mathrm{~kpc}$,\nand we suggest that the bulk of their radio emission is powered by star\nformation in their host galaxies. \"Radio silent\" QSOs ($L_6 \\lesssim 10^{\\,21}\n\\mathrm{~W~Hz}^{-1}$) are rare, so most RQQ host galaxies form stars faster\nthan the Milky Way; they are not \"red and dead\" ellipticals. Earlier radio\nobservations did not have the luminosity sensitivity $L_6 \\lesssim 10^{\\,21}\n\\mathrm{~W~Hz}^{-1}$ needed to distinguish between such RLQs and RQQs. Strong,\ngenerally double-sided, radio emission spanning $\\gg 10 \\mathrm{~kpc}$ was\nfound associated with 13 of the 18 RLQ cores having peak flux densities\n$S_\\mathrm{p} > 5 \\mathrm{~mJy~beam}^{-1}$ ($log(L) \\gtrsim 24$). The radio\nluminosity function of optically selected QSOs and the extended radio emission\nassociated with RLQs are both inconsistent with simple \"unified\" models that\ninvoke relativistic beaming from randomly oriented QSOs to explain the\ndifference between RLQs and RQQs. Some intrinsic property of the AGNs or their\nhost galaxies must also determine whether or not a QSO appears radio loud.\n", "  We study the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of massless scalar\nmatter field in asymptotic flat spacetime in $f(R)$ gravity. In the Einstein\nframe of $f(R)$ gravity, an additional scalar field arises due to the conformal\ntransformation. We find that besides the usual competition between\ngravitational energy and kinetic energy in the process of gravitational\ncollapse, the new scalar field brought by the conformal transformation adds one\nmore competing force in the dynamical system. The dynamical competition can be\ncontrolled by tuning the amplitudes of the initial perturbations of the new\nscalar field and the matter field. To understand the physical reasons behind\nthese phenomena, we analyze the gravitational potential behavior and calculate\nthe Ricci scalar at center with the change of initial amplitudes of\nperturbations. We find rich physics on the formation of black holes through\ngravitational collapse in $f(R)$ gravity.\n", "  To understand the recently observed high temperature superconductivity in the\nmonolayer CuO$_2$ grown on the Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ substrates,\nwe propose a two band model of the hybridized oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals\nwith the proximity effect of the substrate. We demonstrate that both the nodal\nand nodeless d-wave superconducting states can be induced by the proximity\neffect, depending on the strengths of the pairing parameters.\n", "  We review the recently proposed Dirac composite fermion theory of the\nhalf-filled Landau level. This paper is based on a talk given at the Nambu\nSymposium at University of Chicago, March 11-13, 2016.\n", "  We present a reconstruction of the studies on the Foundations of Quantum\nMechanics (FQM) carried out in Italy at the turn of the 1960s. Actually, they\npreceded the revival of the interest of the American physicists towards the FQM\naround mid-1970s, recently reconstructed by David Kaiser in a book of 2011. An\nelement common to both cases is the role played by the young generation, even\nthough the respective motivations were quite different. In the US they reacted\nto research cuts after the war in Vietnam, and were inspired by the New Age\nmood. In Italy the dissatisfaction of the young generations was rooted in the\nstudent protests of 1968 and the subsequent labour and social fights, which\nchallenged the role of scientists. The young generations of physicists searched\nfor new scientific approaches and challenged their own scientific knowledge and\nrole. The criticism to the FQM and the perspectives of submitting them to\nexperimental tests were perceived as an innovative research field and this\nattitude was directly linked to the search for an innovative and radical\napproach in the history of science. All these initiatives gave rise to booming\nactivity throughout the 1970s, contributing to influence the scientific\nattitude and the teaching approach.\n", "  A comparative study of fission of actinides specially $^{238}$U, by proton\nand bremsstrahlung photon is performed. Relative mass distribution of $^{238}$U\nfission fragments have been explored theoretically for both proton and photon\ninduced fission. The integrated yield along with charge distribution of the\nproducts are calculated to find out the neutron richness in comparison to the\nnuclei produced by r-process in nucleosynthesis. Some r-process nuclei in\nintermediate mass range for symmetric fission mode are found to be produced\nalmost two order of magnitude more for proton induced fission than\nphotofission, although rest of the neutron rich nuclei in the asymmetric mode\nare produced in comparable proportion for both the processes.\n", "  We give a detailed account of the properties of spinning Ellis wormholes,\nsupported by a phantom field. The general set of solutions depends on three\nparameters, associated with the size of the throat, the rotation and the\nsymmetry of the solutions. For symmetric wormholes the global charges possess\nthe same values in both asymptotic regions, while this is no longer the case\nfor non-symmetric wormholes. We present mass formulae for these wormholes,\nstudy their quadrupole moments, and discuss the geometry of their throat and\ntheir ergoregion. We demonstrate, that these wormholes possess limiting\nconfigurations corresponding to an extremal Kerr black hole. Moreover, we\nanalyze the geodesics of these wormholes, and show that they possess bound\norbits.\n", "  Observations of the INTEGRAL satellite revealed the presence of yet\nunexplained excess in the central region of the Galaxy at the energies around\n511 keV. These gamma-rays are produced in the process of positron annihilation,\nthe needed rate is around $10^{42}~\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. In this short paper it is\nshown that \\pos -emitting isotopes that are formed in interactions of\nsubrelativistic cosmic rays (CRs) with light nuclei (CNONe) can account for a\nconsiderable fraction -- up to several tens of percent -- of $e^{+}$ production\nrate in the central region.\n", "  Recent Advanced LIGO detections of binary black hole mergers have prompted\nmultiple studies investigating the possibility that the heavy GW150914 binary\nsystem was of primordial origin, and hence could be evidence for dark matter in\nthe form of black holes. We compute the stochastic background arising from the\nincoherent superposition of such primordial binary black hole systems in the\nuniverse and compare it to the similar background spectrum due to binary black\nhole systems of stellar origin. We investigate the possibility of detecting\nthis background with future gravitational wave detectors, and discuss the\npossibility of using the stochastic gravitational-wave background measurement\nto constrain the dark matter component in the form of black holes.\n", "  Second-order self-force computations, which will be essential in modeling\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals, involve two major new difficulties that were not\npresent at first order. One is the problem of large scales, discussed in [Phys.\nRev. D 92, 104047 (2015)]. Here we discuss the second difficulty, which occurs\ninstead on small scales: if we expand the field equations in spherical\nharmonics, then because the first-order field contains a singularity, we\nrequire an arbitrarily large number of first-order modes to accurately compute\neven a single second-order mode. This is a generic feature of nonlinear field\nequations containing singularities, allowing us to study it in the simple\ncontext of a scalar toy model in flat space. Using that model, we illustrate\nthe problem and demonstrate a robust strategy for overcoming it.\n", "  Using Keck/HIRES spectra {\\Delta}v ~ 7 km/s, we analyze forbidden lines of [O\nI] 6300 {\\AA}, [O I] 5577 {\\AA} and [S II] 6731 {\\AA} from 33 T Tauri stars\ncovering a range of disk evolutionary stages. After removing a high velocity\ncomponent (HVC) associated with microjets, we study the properties of the low\nvelocity component (LVC). The LVC can be attributed to slow disk winds that\ncould be magnetically (MHD) or thermally (photoevaporative) driven. Both of\nthese winds play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of\nprotoplanetary material.\n  LVC emission is seen in all 30 stars with detected [O I] but only in 2 out of\neight with detected [S II] , so our analysis is largely based on the properties\nof the [O I] LVC. The LVC itself is resolved into broad (BC) and narrow (NC)\nkinematic components. Both components are found over a wide range of accretion\nrates and their luminosity is correlated with the accretion luminosity, but the\nNC is proportionately stronger than the BC in transition disks.\n  The FWHM of both the BC and NC correlates with disk inclination, consistent\nwith Keplerian broadening from radii of 0.05 to 0.5 AU and 0.5 to 5 AU,\nrespectively. The velocity centroids of the BC suggest formation in an MHD disk\nwind, with the largest blueshifts found in sources with closer to face-on\norientations. The velocity centroids of the NC however, show no dependence on\ndisk inclination. The origin of this component is less clear and the evidence\nfor photoevaporation is not conclusive.\n", "  We present an asteroseismic analysis of 33 solar-type stars observed in short\ncadence during Campaigns (C) 1-3 of the NASA K2 mission. We were able to\nextract both average seismic parameters and individual mode frequencies for\nstars with dominant frequencies up to ~3300{\\mu}Hz, and we find that data for\nsome targets are good enough to allow for a measurement of the rotational\nsplitting. Modelling of the extracted parameters is performed by using\ngrid-based methods using average parameters and individual frequencies together\nwith spectroscopic parameters. For the target selection in C3, stars were\nchosen as in C1 and C2 to cover a wide range in parameter space to better\nunderstand the performance and noise characteristics. For C3 we still detected\noscillations in 73% of the observed stars that we proposed. Future K2 campaigns\nhold great promise for the study of nearby clusters and the chemical evolution\nand age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in the solar neighbourhood.\nWe expect oscillations to be detected in ~388 short-cadence targets if the K2\nmission continues until C18, which will greatly complement the ~500 detections\nof solar-like oscillations made for short-cadence targets during the nominal\nKepler mission. For ~30-40 of these, including several members of the Hyades\nopen cluster, we furthermore expect that inference from interferometry should\nbe possible.\n", "  Ap Librae is one out of a handful of low-frequency peaked blazars to be\ndetected at TeV $\\gamma$-rays and the only one with an identified X-ray jet.\nCombined observations of Fermi-LAT at high energies (HE) and of H.E.S.S at very\nhigh energies (VHE) revealed a striking spectral property of Ap Librae; the\npresence of a broad high-energy component that extends more than nine orders of\nmagnitude in energy and is, therefore, hard to be explained by the usual\nsingle-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We show that the superposition of\ndifferent emission components related to photohadronic interactions can explain\nthe $\\gamma$-ray emission of Ap Librae without invoking external radiation\nfields. We present two indicative model fits to the spectral energy\ndistribution of Ap Librae where the VHE emission is assumed to originate from a\ncompact, sub-pc scale region of the jet. A robust prediction of our model is\nVHE flux variability on timescales similar to those observed at X-rays and HE\n$\\gamma$-rays, which can be further used to distinguish between a sub-pc or kpc\nscale origin of the TeV emission. We thus calculate the expected variability\nsignatures at X-rays, HE and VHE $\\gamma$-rays and show that quasi-simultaneous\nflares are expected, with larger amplitude flares appearing at $\\gamma$-rays.\nWe assess the detectability of VHE variability from Ap Librae with CTA, next\ngeneration of IACTs. We show that $\\sim$hr timescale variability at\n$E_{\\gamma}>0.1$ TeV could be detectable at high significance with shorter\nexposure times than current Cherenkov telescopes.\n", "  Dating back to the first observations of the on-disk corona, there has been a\nqualitative link between the photosphere's magnetic network and enhanced\ntransition-temperature plasma emission. These observations led to the\ndevelopment of a general model that describes emission structures through the\npartitioning of the atmospheric volume with different magnetic loop geometries\nthat exhibit different energetic equilibria. Does the internetwork produce\ntransition-temperature emission? What fraction of network flux connects to the\ncorona? How does quiet sun emission compare with low-activity Sun-like stars?\nIn this work, we revisit the canonical model of the quiet sun, with\nhigh-resolution observations from IRIS and HMI in hand, to address those\nquestions. We use over 900 deep exposures of Si IV 1393A from IRIS along with\nnearly simultaneous HMI magnetograms to quantify the correlation between\ntransition-temperature emission structures and magnetic field concentrations\nthrough a number of novel statistics. Our observational results are coupled\nwith analysis of the Bifrost MHD model and a large-scale potential field model.\nOur results paint a complex portrait of the quiet sun. We measure an emission\nsignature in the distant internetwork that cannot be attributed to network\ncontribution. We find that the dimmest regions of emission are not linked to\nthe local vertical magnetic field. Using the MHD simulation, we categorize the\nemission contribution from cool mid-altitude loops and high-altitude coronal\nloops and discuss the potential emission contribution of spicules. Our results\nprovide new constraints on the coupled solar atmosphere so that we can build on\nour understanding of how dynamic thermal and magnetic structures generate the\nobserved phenomena in the transition region.\n", "  The total gas mass of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental, but poorly\ndetermined, quantity. A new technique \\citep{bergin+13} has been demonstrated\nto assess directly the bulk molecular gas reservoir of molecular hydrogen using\nthe HD J=1-0 line at 112 $\\mu$m. In this work we present a {\\it Herschel} Space\nObservatory\\footnote{Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science\ninstruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with\nimportant participation from NASA.} survey of six additional T Tauri disks in\nthe HD line. Line emission is detected at $>$3$\\sigma$ significance in two\ncases: DM Tau and GM Aur. For the other four disks, we establish upper limits\nto the line flux. Using detailed disk structure and ray tracing models, we\ncalculate the temperature structure and dust mass from modeling the observed\nspectral energy distributions, and include the effect of UV gas heating to\ndetermine the amount of gas required to fit the HD line. The range of gas\nmasses are 1.0-4.7$\\times10^{-2}$ for DM Tau and 2.5-20.4$\\times10^{-2}$ for GM\nAur. These values are larger than those found using CO for GM Aur, while the\nCO-derived gas mass for DM Tau is consistent with the lower end of our mass\nrange. This suggests a CO chemical depletion from the gas phase of up to a\nfactor of five for DM Tau and up to two orders of magnitude for GM Aur. We\ndiscuss how future analysis can narrow the mass ranges further.\n", "  A precise determination of the mass function is an important tool to verify\ncosmological predictions of the $\\Lambda$CDM model and to infer more precisely\nthe better model describing the evolution of the Universe. Galaxy clusters have\nbeen currently used to infer cosmological parameters, in particular the matter\ndensity parameter $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$, the matter power spectrum normalization\n$\\sigma_8$ and the equation of state parameter $w_{\\rm de}$ of the dark energy\nfluid. In this work, using data on massive galaxy clusters ($M>8\\times\n10^{14}~h^{-1}~M_{\\odot}$) in the redshift range $0.05\\lesssim z\\lesssim 0.83$\nwe put constraints on the parameter $\\alpha$ introduced within the formalism of\nthe extended spherical collapse model to quantify deviations from sphericity\ndue to shear and rotation. Since at the moment there is no physical model\ndescribing its functional shape, we assume it to be a logarithmic function of\nthe cluster mass. By holding $\\sigma_8$ fixed and restricting our analysis to a\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, we find, at $1-\\sigma$ confidence level, $\\Omega_{\\rm\nm}=0.284\\pm0.0064$, $h=0.678\\pm0.017$ and $\\beta=0.0019^{+0.0008}_{-0.0015}$,\nwhere $\\beta$ represents the slope of the parameter $\\alpha$. This results\ntranslates into a $9\\%$ decrement of the number of massive clusters with\nrespect to a standard $\\Lambda$CDM mass function, but better data are required\nto better constrain this quantity, since at the $2-\\sigma$ and $3-\\sigma$\nconfidence level we are only able to infer upper limits.\n", "  We present a microscopic semi-analytical theory for the description of\norganic molecules interacting strongly with a cavity mode. Exciton-vibration\ncoupling within the molecule and exciton-cavity interaction are treated on an\nequal footing by employing a temperature-dependent variational approach. The\ninterplay between strong exciton-vibration coupling and strong exciton-cavity\ncoupling gives rise to a hybrid ground state, which we refer to as the lower\npolaron polariton. Explicit expressions for the ground-state wave function, the\nzero-temperature quasiparticle weight of the lower polaron polariton, the\nphotoluminescence line strength, and the mean number of vibrational quanta are\nobtained in terms of the optimal variational parameters. The dependence of\nthese quantities upon the exciton-cavity coupling strength reveals that strong\ncavity coupling leads to an enhanced vibrational dressing of the cavity mode,\nand at the same time a vibrational decoupling of the dark excitons, which in\nturn results in a lower polaron polariton resembling a single-mode dressed bare\nlower polariton in the strong-coupling regime. Thermal effects on several\nobservables are briefly discussed.\n", "  We report on a detailed investigation of the spin-1 $J_1-J_2-J_3$ Heisenberg\nmodel, a frustrated model with nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$, next-nearest\nneighbor coupling $J_2$, and a three site interaction $J_3\\left[({\\bf\nS}_{i-1}\\cdot {\\bf S}_i)({\\bf S}_i\\cdot {\\bf S}_{i+1})+{\\mathrm H.c.}\\right]$\npreviously studied in [Phys. Rev. B 93, 241108(R) (2016)]. Using DMRG and exact\ndiagonalizations, we show that the phase boundaries between the Haldane phase,\nthe next-nearest neighbor Haldane phase and the dimerized phase can be very\naccurately determined by combining the information deduced from the\ndimerization, the ground-state energy, the entanglement spectrum and the Berry\nphase. By a careful investigation of the finite-size spectrum, we also show\nthat the transition between the next-nearest neighbor Haldane phase and the\ndimerized phase is in the Ising universality class all along the critical line.\nFurthermore, we justify the conformal embedding of the $SU(2)_2$\nWess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory in terms of a boson and an Ising\nfield, and we explicitly derive a number of consequences of this embedding for\nthe spectrum along the $SU(2)_2$ transition line between the Haldane phase and\nthe dimerized phase. We also show that the solitons along the first-order\ntransition line between the Haldane phase and the dimerized phase carry a\nspin-1/2, while those between different dimerization domains inside the\ndimerized phase carry a spin 1. Finally, we show that short-range correlations\nchange character in the Haldane and dimerized phases through disorder and\nLifshitz lines, as well as through the development of short-range dimer\ncorrelations in the Haldane phase, leading to a remarkably rich phase diagram.\n", "  At present, Babcock-Leighton flux transport solar dynamo models appear as the\nmost promising model for explaining diverse observational aspects of the\nsunspot cycle. The success of these flux transport dynamo models is largely\ndependent upon a single-cell meridional circulation with a deep equatorward\ncomponent at the base of the Sun's convection zone. However, recent\nobservations suggest that the meridional flow may in fact be very shallow\n(confined to the top 10 % of the Sun) and more complex than previously thought.\nTaken together these observations raise serious concerns on the validity of the\nflux transport paradigm. By accounting for the turbulent pumping of magnetic\nflux as evidenced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection, we\ndemonstrate that flux transport dynamo models can generate solar-like magnetic\ncycles even if the meridional flow is shallow. Solar-like periodic reversals is\nrecovered even when meridional circulation is altogether absent, however, in\nthis case the solar surface magnetic field dynamics does not extend all the way\nto the polar regions. Very importantly, our results demonstrate that the\nParker-Yoshimura sign rule for dynamo wave propagation can be circumvented in\nBabcock-Leighton dynamo models by the latitudinal component of turbulent\npumping -- which can generate equatorward propagating sunspot belts in the\nabsence of a deep, equatorward meridional flow. We also show that variations in\nturbulent pumping coefficients can modulate the solar cycle amplitude and\nperiodicity. Our results suggest the viability of an alternate magnetic flux\ntransport paradigm -- mediated via turbulent pumping -- for sustaining\nsolar-stellar dynamo action.\n", "  We apply a recently developed method (V. A. Dzuba, PRA 90, 012517 (2014); J.\nS. M. Ginges and V. A. Dzuba, PRA 91, 042505 (2015)) to calculate energy levels\nof superheavy elements Uut (Z = 113), Fl (Z = 114), and Fl+. The method\ncombines the linearized single-double coupledcluster technigue, the all-order\ncorrelation potential method and configuration interaction method. Breit and\nquantum electrodynamic corrections are included. The role of relativistic and\ncorrelation effects is discussed. Similar calculations for Tl, Pb and Pb+ are\nused to gauge the accuracy of the calculations.\n", "  Zeta Aquarii is a bright and nearby (28 pc) triple star with a 26-year\nastrometric subsystem. Almost a half of the outer 540-year visual orbit has\nbeen covered in 238 years of its observations. Both inner and outer orbits are\nrevised here taking into account recent direct resolution of the inner pair\nAa,Ab. The inner orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.87 and is inclined to the\nouter orbit by 140+-10 degrees, suggesting that Kozai-Lidov cycles take place.\nThe masses of the stars Aa, B, and Ab are 1.4, 1.4, and 0.6 solar. The age of\nthe system is about 3 Gyr, and the two main components have just left the main\nsequence. Hypothetically, this system could have formed by a dynamical capture\nof the small star Ab in the twin binary Aa,B.\n", "  Determinations of the chemical composition of red giants in a large sample of\nopen clusters show that the abundances of the heavy elements La, Ce, Nd and Sm\nbut not so obviously Y and Eu vary from one cluster to another across a sample\nall having about the solar metallicity. For La, Ce, Nd and Sm the amplitudes of\nthe variations at solar metallicity scale approximately with the main s-process\ncontribution to solar system material. Consideration of published abundances of\nfield stars suggest that such a spread in heavy element abundances is present\nfor the thin and thick disk stars of different metallicity. This new result\nprovides an opportunity to chemically tag stars by their heavy elements and to\nreconstruct dissolved open clusters from the field star population.\n", "  Carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the Galactic Halo display\nenrichments in heavy elements associated with either the s (slow) or the r\n(rapid) neutron-capture process (e.g., barium and europium respectively), and\nin some cases they display evidence of both. The abundance patterns of these\nCEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu enrichment, are particularly puzzling\nsince the s and the r processes require neutron densities that are more than\nten orders of magnitude apart, and hence are thought to occur in very different\nstellar sites with very different physical conditions. We investigate whether\nthe abundance patterns of CEMP-s/r stars can arise from the nucleosynthesis of\nthe intermediate neutron-capture process (the i process), which is\ncharacterised by neutron densities between those of the s and the r processes.\nUsing nuclear network calculations, we study neutron capture nucleosynthesis at\ndifferent constant neutron densities n ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$\ncm$^{-3}$. With respect to the classical s process resulting from neutron\ndensities on the lowest side of this range, neutron densities on the highest\nside result in abundance patterns that show an increased production of heavy\ns-process and r-process elements but similar abundances of the light s-process\nelements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars due to proton ingestion episodes. Comparison to the\nsurface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars show that our modelled i-process\nabundances successfully reproduce observed abundance patterns that could not be\npreviously explained by s-process nucleosynthesis. Because the i-process models\nfit the abundances of CEMP-s/r stars so well, we propose that this class should\nbe renamed as CEMP-i.\n", "  Entropy is a critical, but often overlooked, factor in determining the\nrelative stabilities of crystal phases. The importance of entropy is most\npronounced in softer materials, where small changes in free energy can drive\nphase transitions, which has recently been demonstrated in the case of\norganic-inorganic hybrid-formate perovskites. In this study we demonstrate the\ninterplay between composition and crystal-structure that is responsible for the\nparticularly pronounced role of entropy in determining polymorphism in hybrid\norganic-inorganic materials. Using ab initio based lattice dynamics we probe\nthe origins and effects of vibrational entropy of four archetype perovskite\n(ABX$_3$) structures. We consider a fully inorganic material (SrTiO$_3$), an\nA-site hybrid halide material (CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$), an X-site hybrid material\n(KSr(BH$_4$)$_3$) and a mixed A- and X-site hybrid-formate material\n(N$_2$H$_5$Zn(HCO$_2$)$_3$), comparing the differences in entropy between two\ncommon polymorphs. The results demonstrate the importance of low-frequency\ninter-molecular modes in determining phase stability in these materials. The\nunderstanding gained allows us to propose a general principle for the relative\nstability of different polymorphs of hybrid materials as temperature is\nincreased.\n", "  We report new spectral modeling of the accreting X-ray pulsar Hercules X- 1.\nOur radiation-dominated radiative shock model is an implementation of the\nanalytic work of Becker & Wolff on Comptonized accretion flows onto magnetic\nneutron stars. We obtain a good fit to the spin-phase averaged 4 to 78 keV\nX-ray spectrum observed by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array during a\nmain- on phase of the Her X-1 35-day accretion disk precession period. This\nmodel allows us to estimate the accretion rate, the Comptonizing temperature of\nthe radiating plasma, the radius of the magnetic polar cap, and the average\nscattering opacity parameters in the accretion column. This is in contrast to\nprevious phenomenological models that characterized the shape of the X-ray\nspectrum but could not determine the physical parameters of the accretion flow.\nWe describe the spectral fitting details and discuss the interpretation of the\naccretion flow physical parameters.\n", "  We use a combination of spatial distribution and radial velocity to search\nfor halo sub-structures in a sample of 412 RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) that covers a\n$\\sim 525$ square degrees region of the Virgo Overdensity (VOD) and spans\ndistances from the Sun from 4 to 75 kpc. With a friends-of-friends algorithm we\nidentified six high significance groups of RRLS in phase space, which we\nassociate mainly with the VOD and with the Sagittarius stream. Four other\ngroups were also flagged as less significant overdensities. Three high\nsignificance and 3 lower significance groups have distances between $\\sim 10$\nand 20 kpc, which places them with the distance range attributed by others to\nthe VOD. The largest of these is the Virgo Stellar Stream (VSS) at 19 kpc,\nwhich has 18 RRLS, a factor of 2 increase over the number known previously.\nWhile these VOD groups are distinct according to our selection cirteria, their\noverlap in position and distance, and, in a few cases, similarity in radial\nvelocity are suggestive that they may not all stem separate accretion events.\nEven so, the VOD appears to be caused by more than one overdensity. The Sgr\nstream is a very obvious feature in the background of the VOD at a mean\ndistance of 44 kpc. Two additional high significant groups were detected at\ndistances $>40$ kpc. Their radial velocities and locations differ from the\nexpected path of the Sgr debris in this part of the sky, and they are likely to\nbe remnants of other accretion events.\n", "  We present Karl G. Janksy Very Large Array (VLA) 1.3 cm, 3.6 cm, and 6 cm\ncontinuum maps of compact radio sources in the Orion Nebular Cluster. We\nmosaicked 34 square arcminutes at 1.3 cm, 70 square arcminutes at 3.6 cm and\n109 square arcminutes at 6 cm, containing 778 near-infrared detected YSOs and\n190 HST-identified proplyds (with significant overlap between those\ncharacterizations). We detected radio emission from 175 compact radio sources\nin the ONC, including 26 sources that were detected for the first time at these\nwavelengths. For each detected source we fit a simple free-free and dust\nemission model to characterize the radio emission. We extrapolate the free-free\nemission spectrum model for each source to ALMA bands to illustrate how these\nmeasurements could be used to correctly measure protoplanetary disk dust masses\nfrom sub-millimeter flux measurements. Finally, we compare the fluxes measured\nin this survey with previously measured fluxes for our targets, as well as four\nseparate epochs of 1.3 cm data, to search for and quantify variability of our\nsources.\n", "  A novel approach to the Effective One-Body description of gravitationally\ninteracting two-body systems is introduced. This approach is based on the\npost-Minkowskian approximation scheme (perturbation theory in G, without\nassuming small velocities), and employs a new dictionary focussing on the\nfunctional dependence of the scattering angle on the total energy and the total\nangular momentum of the system. Using this approach, we prove to all orders in\nv/c two results that were previously known to hold only to a limited\npost-Newtonian accuracy: (i) the relativistic gravitational dynamics of a\ntwo-body system is equivalent, at first post-Minkowskian order, to the\nrelativistic dynamics of an effective test particle moving in a Schwarzschild\nmetric; and (ii) this equivalence requires the existence of an exactly\nquadratic map between the real (relativistic) two-body energy and the\n(relativistic) energy of the effective particle. The same energy map is also\nshown to apply to the effective one-body description of two masses interacting\nvia tensor-scalar gravity.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the effect of long-ranged dipole-dipole\ninteraction (LRDDI) on a superradiant laser (SL). This effect is induced from\nthe atom-photon interaction in the dissipation process. In the bad-cavity limit\nusually performed to initiate SL, we demonstrate that cavity photon number\noscillates as an inter-particle distance of the atoms varies. Similarly the\natom-atom coherence alternates with signs, showing critical transitions\nalternatively in SL operations. This suggests a complexity of the collective\neffect emerging in a large ensemble of atoms. Therefore this effect in a SL can\nnot be simply interpreted by only a part of the whole ensemble. We numerically\nsolve for a steady state SL including the spatially-dependent LRDDI, and locate\nthe maximal cavity photon number and the minimal spectral linewidth\nrespectively at the optimal atomic separations in the setting of an equidistant\natomic array. The scaling of a finite number of atoms shows an outperformed\nsteady state SL than the one without LRDDI, which allows for probing narrow\natomic transitions and is potentially useful for precision measurements and\nnext generation optical clocks.\n", "  This work presents the first characterization of the internal structure of\noverpressured steady superfast magnetosonic relativistic jets in connection\nwith their dominant type of energy. To this aim, relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of different jet models threaded by a helical\nmagnetic field have been analyzed covering a wide region in the magnetosonic\nMach number - specific internal energy plane. The merit of this plane is that\nmodels dominated by different types of energy (internal energy: hot jets;\nrest-mass energy: kinetically dominated jets; magnetic energy: Poynting-flux\ndominated jets) occupy well separated regions. The analyzed models also cover a\nwide range of magnetizations. Models dominated by the internal energy (i.e.,\nhot models, or Poynting-flux dominated jets with magnetizations larger than but\nclose to 1) have a rich internal structure characterized by a series of\nrecollimation shocks and present the largest variations in the flow Lorentz\nfactor (and internal energy density). Conversely, in kinetically dominated\nmodels there is not much internal nor magnetic energy to be converted into\nkinetic one and the jets are featureless, with small variations in the flow\nLorentz factor. The presence of a significant toroidal magnetic field threading\nthe jet produces large gradients in the transversal profile of the internal\nenergy density. Poynting-flux dominated models with high magnetization (>10)\nare prone to be unstable against magnetic pinch modes, which sets limits to the\nexpected magnetization in parsec-scale AGN jets {and/or constrains their\nmagnetic field configuration}.\n", "  We report the results of Swift/XRT observations (2008-2015) of a\nhyper-luminous X-ray source, ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We found a strong observational\nevidence that ESO 243-49 HLX-1 underwent spectral transitions from the low/hard\nstate to the high/soft state during these observations. The spectra of ESO\n243-49 HLX-1 are well fitted by the so-{called} bulk motion Comptonization\nmodel for all spectral states. We have established the photon index Gamma\nsaturation level, Gamma_{sat}$=3.0+/-0.1, in the correlation of Gamma versus\nmass accretion rate dot M. This Gamma-dot M correlation allows us to estimate\nthe black hole (BH) mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 to be M_{BH}~ 7x 10^4 solar\nmasses, assuming the distance to ESO 243-49 of 95 Mpc. For the BH mass estimate\nwe used the scaling method, taking Galactic BHs XTE~J1550-564, H~1743-322 and\n4U~1630-472, and an extragalactic BH source, M101 ULX-1 as reference sources.\nThe Gamma-dot M correlation revealed in ESO 243-49 HLX-1 is similar to those in\na number of Galactic and extragalactic BHs and it clearly shows the correlation\nalong with the strong Gamma saturation at ~ 3. This is a reliable observational\nevidence of a BH in ESO 243-49 HLX-1. We also found that the seed (disk) photon\ntemperatures are quite low, of order of 50-140 eV which are consistent with a\nhigh BH mass in ESO 243-49 HLX-1.\n", "  In an ultracold, optically trapped mixture of $^{87}$Rb and metastable\ntriplet $^4$He atoms we have studied trap loss for different spin-state\ncombinations, for which interspecies Penning ionization is the main two-body\nloss process. We observe long trapping lifetimes for the purely quartet\nspin-state combination, indicating strong suppression of Penning ionization\nloss by at least two orders of magnitude. For the other spin-mixtures we\nobserve short lifetimes that depend linearly on the doublet character of the\nentrance channel. We compare the extracted loss rate coefficient with recent\npredictions of multichannel quantum-defect theory for reactive collisions\ninvolving a strong exothermic loss channel and find near-universal loss for\ndoublet scattering. Our work demonstrates control of reactive collisions by\ninternal atomic state preparation.\n", "  The magnification effect due to gravitational lensing enhances the chances of\ndetecting moderate-redshift ($z \\sim 1$) sources in very-high-energy (VHE; $E >\n100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-rays by ground-based Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope\nfacilities. It has been shown in previous work that this prospect is not\nhampered by potential $\\gamma-\\gamma$ absorption effects by the intervening\n(lensing) galaxy, nor by any individual star within the intervening galaxy. In\nthis paper, we expand this study to simulate the light-bending effect of a\nrealistic ensemble of stars. We first demonstrate that, for realistic\nparameters of the galaxy's star field, it is extremely unlikely (probability\n$\\lesssim 10^{-6}$) that the direct line of sight between the $\\gamma$-ray\nsource and the observer passes by any star in the field close enough to be\nsubject to significant $\\gamma\\gamma$ absorption. Our simulations then focus on\nthe rare cases where $\\gamma\\gamma$ absorption by (at least) one individual\nstar might be non-negligible. We show that gravitational light bending will\nhave the effect of avoiding the $\\gamma-\\gamma$ absorption spheres around\nmassive stars in the intervening galaxy. This confirms previous results by\nBarnacka et al. and re-inforces arguments in favour of VHE $\\gamma$-ray\nobservations of lensed moderate-redshift blazars to extend the redshift range\nof objects detected in VHE $\\gamma$-rays, and to probe the location of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission region in those blazars.\n", "  In a recent letter, arXiv:1509.00021, it was shown that the lensing of light\naround rotating boson stars and Kerr black holes with scalar hair can exhibit\nchaotic patterns. Since no separation of variables is known (or expected) for\ngeodesic motion on these backgrounds, we examine the 2D effective potentials\nfor photon trajectories, to obtain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.\nWe find that the emergence of stable light rings on the background spacetimes,\nallows the formation of \"pockets\" in one of the effective potentials, for open\nsets of impact parameters, leading to an effective trapping of some\ntrajectories, dubbed quasi-bound orbits. We conclude that pocket formation\ninduces chaotic scattering, although not all chaotic orbits are associated to\npockets. These and other features are illustrated in a gallery of examples,\nobtained with a new ray-tracing code, PYHOLE, which includes tools for a\nsimple, simultaneous visualization of the effective potential together with the\nspacetime trajectory, for any given point in a lensing image. An analysis of\nphoton orbits allows us to further establish a positive correlation between\nphoton orbits in chaotic regions and those with more than one turning point in\nthe radial direction; we recall that the latter is not possible around Kerr\nblack holes. Moreover, we observe that the existence of several light rings\naround a horizon (several fundamental orbits, including a stable one), is a\ncentral ingredient for the existence of multiple shadows of a single hairy\nblack hole. We also exhibit the lensing and shadows by Kerr black holes with\nscalar hair, observed away from the equatorial plane, obtained with PYHOLE.\n", "  We analyze the broad-band X-ray spectrum (0.3-50 keV) of the luminous Seyfert\n1 / quasar PG 1211+143 - the archetypal source for high-velocity X-ray outflows\n- using near-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. We compare pure\nrelativistic reflection models with a model including the strong imprint of\nphotoionized emission and absorption from a high-velocity wind (Pounds16a,16b),\nfinding a spectral fit that extrapolates well over the higher photon energies\ncovered by NuSTAR. Inclusion of the high S/N XMM-Newton spectrum provides much\ntighter constraints on the model parameters, with a much harder photon index /\nlower reflection fraction compared to that from the NuSTAR data alone. We show\nthat pure relativistic reflection models are not able to account for the\nspectral complexity of PG 1211+143 and that wind absorption models are strongly\nrequired to match the data in both the soft X-ray and Fe K spectral regions. In\nconfirming the significance of previously reported ionized absorption features,\nthe new analysis provides a further demonstration of the power of combining the\nhigh throughput and resolution of long-look XMM-Newton observations with the\nunprecedented spectral coverage of NuSTAR.\n", "  The binary millisecond radio pulsar PSR J1023+0038 exhibits many\ncharacteristics similar to the gamma-ray binary system PSR B1259--63/LS 2883,\nmaking it an ideal candidate for the study of high-energy non-thermal emission.\nIt has been the subject of multi-wavelength campaigns following the\ndisappearance of the pulsed radio emission in 2013 June, which revealed the\nappearance of an accretion disk around the neutron star. We present the results\nof very high-energy gamma-ray observations carried out by VERITAS before and\nafter this change of state. Searches for steady and pulsed emission of both\ndata sets yield no significant gamma-ray signal above 100 GeV, and upper limits\nare given for both a steady and pulsed gamma-ray flux. These upper limits are\nused to constrain the magnetic field strength in the shock region of the PSR\nJ1023+0038 system. Assuming that very high-energy gamma rays are produced via\nan inverse-Compton mechanism in the shock region, we constrain the shock\nmagnetic field to be greater than $\\sim$2 G before the disappearance of the\nradio pulsar and greater than $\\sim$10 G afterwards.\n", "  We present new SOFIA-FORCAST observations obtained in Feburary 2016 of the\narchetypal outbursting low mass young stellar object FU Orionis, and compare\nthe continuum, solid state, and gas properties with mid-IR data obtained at the\nsame wavelengths in 2004 with Spitzer-IRS. In this study, we conduct the first\nmid-IR spectroscopic comparison of an FUor over a long time period. Over a 12\nyear period, UBVR monitoring indicates that FU Orionis has continued its steady\ndecrease in overall brightness by ~ 14%. We find that this decrease in\nluminosity occurs only at wavelengths < 20 microns. In particular, the\ncontinuum short ward of the silicate emission complex at 10 microns exhibits a\n~ 12% (~ 3 sigma) drop in flux density, but no apparent change in slope; both\nthe Spitzer and SOFIA spectra are consistent with a 7200 K blackbody.\nAdditionally, the detection of water absorption is consistent with the Spitzer\nspectrum. The silicate emission feature at 10 microns continues to be\nconsistent with unprocessed grains, unchanged over 12 years. We conclude that\neither the accretion rate in FU Orionis has decreased by ~ 12-14% over this\ntime baseline, or that the inner disk has cooled, but the accretion disk\nremains in a superheated state outside of the innermost region.\n", "  The recent star formation history (SFH) in the outer disk of NGC 300 is\npresented through the analysis of color magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We analyze\nresolved stellar photometry by creating CMDs from four Hubble Space Telescope\nfields containing a combination of images from the Advanced Camera for Surveys\nand the UVIS imager aboard the Wide Field Camera 3. From the best models of\nthese CMDs, we derive the SFH in order to extract the young stellar component\nfor the past 200 Myrs. We find that the young stellar disk of NGC 300 is\nunbroken out to at least ${\\sim}$8 scale lengths (including an upper limit out\nto ${\\sim}$10 scale lengths) with $r{_s}$ = 1.4 ${\\pm}$ 0.1 kpc, which is\nsimilar to the total stellar surface brightness profile. This unbroken profile\nsuggests that NGC 300 is undisturbed, similar to the isolated disk galaxy NGC\n2403. We compare the environments of NGC 300, NGC 2403, and M33 along with the\nproperties of the gas and stellar disks. We find that the disturbed HI outer\ndisk morphology is not accompanied by a break in the young stellar disk. This\nmay indicate that processes which affect the outer HI morphology may not leave\nan imprint on the young stellar disk.\n", "  For the first time, we explore the dynamics of the central region of a galaxy\ncluster within $r_{500}\\sim 600h^{-1}$~kpc from its center by combining optical\nand X-ray spectroscopy. We use (1) the caustic technique that identifies the\ncluster substructures and their galaxy members with optical spectroscopic data,\nand (2) the X-ray redshift fitting procedure that estimates the redshift\ndistribution of the intracluster medium (ICM). We use the spatial and redshift\ndistributions of the galaxies and of the X-ray emitting gas to associate the\noptical substructures to the X-ray regions. When we apply this approach to\nAbell 85 (A85), a complex dynamical structure of A85 emerges from our analysis:\na galaxy group, with redshift $z=0.0509 \\pm 0.0021$ is passing through the\ncluster center along the line of sight dragging part of the ICM present in the\ncluster core; two additional groups, at redshift $z=0.0547 \\pm 0.0022$ and\n$z=0.0570 \\pm 0.0020$, are going through the cluster in opposite directions,\nalmost perpendicularly to the line of sight, and have substantially perturbed\nthe dynamics of the ICM. An additional group in the outskirts of A85, at\nredshift $z=0.0561 \\pm 0.0023$, is associated to a secondary peak of the X-ray\nemission, at redshift $z=0.0583^{+0.0039}_{-0.0047}$. Although our analysis and\nresults on A85 need to be confirmed by high-resolution spectroscopy, they\ndemonstrate how our new approach can be a powerful tool to constrain the\nformation history of galaxy clusters by unveiling their central and surrounding\nstructures.\n", "  The origin of rings around giant planets remains elusive. Saturn's rings are\nmassive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the\ncompositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n", "  HD 11112 is an old, Sun-like star that has a long-term radial velocity (RV)\ntrend indicative of a massive companion on a wide orbit. Here we present direct\nimages of the source responsible for the trend using the Magellan Adaptive\nOptics system. We detect the object (HD 11112B) at a separation of 2\\fasec 2\n(100 AU) at multiple wavelengths spanning 0.6-4 \\microns ~and show that it is\nmost likely a gravitationally-bound cool white dwarf. Modeling its spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) suggests that its mass is 0.9-1.1 \\msun, which\ncorresponds to very high-eccentricity, near edge-on orbits from Markov chain\nMonte Carlo analysis of the RV and imaging data together. The total age of the\nwhite dwarf is $>2\\sigma$ discrepant with that of the primary star under most\nassumptions. The problem can be resolved if the white dwarf progenitor was\ninitially a double white dwarf binary that then merged into the observed\nhigh-mass white dwarf. HD 11112B is a unique and intriguing benchmark object\nthat can be used to calibrate atmospheric and evolutionary models of cool white\ndwarfs and should thus continue to be monitored by RV and direct imaging over\nthe coming years.\n", "  We investigate the scaling properties of the long-range temporal evolution\nand intermittency of SDO/AIA intensity observations in four solar environments:\nan active region core, a weak emission region, and two core loops. We use two\napproaches: the probability distribution function (PDF) of time series\nincrements, and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Noise\ntaints the results, so we focus on the 171 Angstrom waveband , which has the\nhighest signal-to-noise ratio. The lags between pairs of wavebands distinguish\nbetween coronal versus transition region (TR) emission. In all physical regions\nstudied, scaling in the range 15-45 min is multifractal, and the time series\nare anti-persistent on the average. The degree of anti-correlation in the TR\ntime series is greater than for coronal emission. The multifractality stems\nfrom long term correlations in the data rather than the wide distribution of\nintensities. Observations in the 335 Angstrom waveband can be described in\nterms of a multifractal with added noise. The multiscaling of the EUV data\nagrees qualitatively with the radiance from a phenomenological model of\nimpulsive bursts plus noise, and also from ohmic dissipation in a reduced\nmagnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) model for coronal loop heating. The parameter space\nmust be further explored to seek quantitative agreement. Thus, the\nobservational signatures obtained by the combined tests of the PDF of\nincrements and the MF-DFA offer strong constraints which can systematically\ndiscriminate among models for coronal heating.\n", "  Motivated by statements in the literature which contradict two general\ntheorems, the static and spherically symmetric Brans solutions of scalar-tensor\ngravity are analyzed explicitly in both the Jordan and the Einstein conformal\nframes. Depending on the parameter range, these solutions describe wormholes or\nnaked singularities but not black holes.\n", "  We realize an extensive numerical study of the Naming Game model with a noise\nterm which accounts for perturbations. This model displays a non-equilibrium\nphase transition between an absorbing ordered consensus state, which occurs for\nsmall noise, and a disordered phase with fragmented clusters characterized by\nheterogeneous memories, which emerges at strong noise levels. The nature of the\nphase transition is studied by means of a finite-size scaling analysis of the\nmoments. We observe a scaling behavior typical of a discontinuous transition\nand we are able to estimate the thermodynamic limit. The scaling behavior of\nthe clusters size seems also compatible with this kind of transition.\n", "  We present new medium-resolution spectroscopic observations of the black hole\nX-ray binary Nova Muscae 1991 taken with X-Shooter spectrograph installed at\nthe 8.2m-VLT telescope. These observations allow us to measure the time of\ninferior conjunction of the secondary star with the black hole in this system\nthat, together with previous measurements, yield an orbital period decay of\n$\\dot P=-20.7\\pm12.7$ ms yr$^{-1}$ ($-24.5\\pm15.1$ $\\mu $s per orbital cycle).\nThis is significantly faster than those previously measured in the other black\nhole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. No standard black hole X-ray\nbinary evolutionary model is able to explain this extremely fast orbital decay.\nAt this rate, the secondary star would reach the event horizon (as given by the\nSchwarzschild radius of about 32 km) in roughly 2.7 Myr. This result has\ndramatic implications on the evolution and lifetime of black hole X-ray\nbinaries.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric and spectral study of M87 jet\nobtained at sub- arcsecond resolution between 2002 and 2008. The observations\ninclude multi-band archival VLA polarimetry data sets along with the HST\nimaging polarimetry. These observations have better angular resolution than\nprevious work by factors of 2-3 and in addition, allow us to explore the time\ndomain. These observations envelope the huge flare in HST-1 located at 0.\"86\nfrom the nucleus (Cheung et al. 2007; Harris et al. 2009; Madrid 2009; Perlman\net al. 2011). The increased resolution enables us to view more structure in\neach knot, showing several resolved sub-components. We also see apparent\nhelical structure in the polarization vectors in several knots, with\npolarization vectors turning either clockwise or counterclockwise near the flux\nmaxima in various places as well as show filamentary undulations. Some of these\ncharacteristics are correlated with flux and polarization maxima while others\nare not. We also examine the total flux and fractional polarization and look\nfor changes in both radio and optical since the observations of Perlman et al.\n(1999) and test them against various models based on shocks and instabilities\nin the jet. Our results are broadly consistent with previous spine-sheath\nmodels and recollimation shock models, however, they require additional\ncombinations of features to explain the observed complexity, e.g. shearing of\nmagnetic field lines near the jet surface and compression of the toroidal\ncomponent near shocks. In particular, in many regions we find apparently\nhelical features both in total flux and polarization. We discuss the physical\ninterpretation of these features.\n", "  The breaks and truncations in the luminosity profile of face-on spiral\ngalaxies offer valuable insights in their formation history. The traditional\nmethod of deriving the surface photometry profile for face-on galaxies is to\nuse elliptical averaging. In this paper, we explore the question whether\nelliptical averaging is the best way to do this. We apply two additional\nsurface photometry methods, one new: principle axis summation, and one old that\nhas become seldom used: equivalent profiles. These are compared to elliptically\naveraged profiles using a set of 29 face-on galaxies. We find that the\nequivalent profiles match extremely well with elliptically averaged profiles,\nconfirming the validity of using elliptical averaging. The principle axis\nsummation offers a better comparison to edge-on galaxies.\n", "  Nowadays large spectroscopic surveys, like the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES), provide\nunique stellar databases for better investigating the formation and evolution\nof our Galaxy. Great attention must be paid to the accuracy of the basic\nstellar properties derived: large uncertainties in stellar parameters lead to\nlarge uncertainties in abundances, distances and ages. Asteroseismology has a\nkey role in this context: when seismic information is combined with information\nderived from spectroscopic analysis, highly precise constraints on distances,\nmasses, extinction and ages of Red Giants can be obtained. In the light of this\npromising joint-action, we started the CoRoT-GES collaboration. We present a\nset of 1,111 CoRoT stars, observed by GES from December 2011 to July 2014,\nthese stars belong to the CoRoT field LRc01, pointing at the inner Galactic\nDisk. Among these stars, 534 have reliable global seismic parameters. By\ncombining seismic informations and spectroscopy, we derived precise stellar\nparameters, ages, kinematic and orbital parameters and detailed element\nabundances for this sample of stars. We also show that, thanks to\nasteroseismology, we are able to obtain a higher precision than what can be\nachieved by the standard spectroscopic means. This sample of CoRoT Red Giants,\nspanning Galactocentric distances from 5 to 8 kpc and a wide age interval (1-13\nGyrs), provides us a representative sample for the inner disk population.\n", "  Dense plasma fragments were observed to fall back on the solar surface by the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory after an eruption on 7 June 2011, producing strong\nEUV brightenings. Previous studies investigated impacts in regions of weak\nmagnetic field. Here we model the $\\sim~300$ km/s impact of fragments\nchannelled by the magnetic field close to active regions. In the observations,\nthe magnetic channel brightens before the fragment impact. We use a 3D-MHD\nmodel of spherical blobs downfalling in a magnetized atmosphere. The blob\nparameters are constrained from the observation. We run numerical simulations\nwith different ambient density and magnetic field intensity. We compare the\nmodel emission in the 171\\AA~ channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly with\nthe observed one. We find that a model of downfall channelled in a $\\sim~1$MK\ncoronal loop confined by a magnetic field of $\\sim~10-20$G, best explains\nqualitatively and quantitatively the observed evolution. The blobs are highly\ndeformed, further fragmented, when the ram pressure becomes comparable to the\nlocal magnetic pressure and they are deviated to be channelled by the field,\nbecause of the differential stress applied by the perturbed magnetic field.\nAhead of them, in the relatively dense coronal medium, shock fronts propagate,\nheat and brighten the channel between the cold falling plasma and the solar\nsurface. This study shows a new mechanism which brightens downflows channelled\nby the magnetic field, such as in accreting young stars, and also works as a\nprobe of the ambient atmosphere, providing information about the local plasma\ndensity and magnetic field.\n", "  Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), with a typical duration of 1 ms and 1 Jy flux\ndensity at GHz frequencies, have brightness temperatures exceeding 1e33 K,\nrequiring a coherent emission process. This can be achieved by bunching\nparticles in volumes smaller than the typical wavelength, but this may be\nchallenging. Alternatively, we can have maser emission. Under certain\nconditions, the synchrotron stimulated emission process can be more important\nthan true absorption, and a synchrotron maser can be created. This occurs when\nthe emitting electrons have a very narrow distribution of pitch angles and\nenergies. This process overcomes the difficulties of having extremely dense\nbunches of particles and relaxes the light crossing time limits, since there is\nno simple relation between the actual size of the source and the observed\nvariability timescale.\n", "  Complete sets of reference magnitudes in all 7 Johnson-Cousins bands (U, B,\nV, R, I, Rc and Ic) and the 5 principal Sloan bands (u', g', r', i', and z')\nare presented for the 8 planets. These data are accompanied by illumination\nphase functions and other formulas which characterize the instantaneous\nbrightness of the planets. The main source of Johnson-Cousins magnitudes is a\nseries of individualized photometric studies reported in recent years. Gaps in\nthat dataset were filled with magnitudes synthesized in this study from\npublished spectrophotometry. The planetary Sloan magnitudes, which are\nestablished here for the first time, are an average of newly recorded Sloan\nfilter photometry, synthetic magnitudes and values transformed from the\nJohnson-Cousins system. Geometric albedos derived from these two sets of\nmagnitudes are consistent within each photometric system and between the\nsystems for all planets and in all bands. This consistency validates the\nalbedos themselves as well as the magnitudes from which they were derived. In\naddition, a quantity termed the delta stellar magnitude is introduced to\nindicate the difference between the magnitude of a planet and that of its\nparent star. A table of these delta values for exo-planets possessing a range\nof physical characteristics is presented. The delta magnitudes are for phase\nangle 90 degrees where a planet is near the greatest apparent separation from\nits star. This quantity may be useful in exo-planet detection and observation\nstrategies when an estimate of the signal-to-noise ratio is needed. Likewise,\nthe phase curves presented in this paper can be used for characterizing\nexo-planets. Finally, magnitudes for the proposed Planet Nine are estimated,\nand we note that P9 may be especially faint at red and near-IR wavelengths.\n", "  Since the Lalpha rocket observations of (Gabriel, Solar Phys. 21, 392, 1971),\nit has been realized that the hydrogen (H) lines could be observed in the\ncorona and offer an interesting diagnostic for the temperature, density, and\nradial velocity of the coronal plasma. Moreover, various space missions have\nbeen proposed to measure the coronal magnetic and velocity fields through\npolarimetry in H lines. A necessary condition for such measurements is to\nbenefit from a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. The aim of this article is to\nevaluate the emission in three representative lines of H for three different\ncoronal structures. The computations have been performed with a full non-local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) code and its simplified version without\nradiative transfer. Since all collisionnal and radiative quantities (including\nincident ionizing and exciting radiation) are taken into account, the\nionization is treated exactly. Profiles are presented at two heights (1.05 and\n1.9 solar radii, from Sun center) in the corona, and the integrated intensities\nare computed at heights up to five solar radii.We compare our results with\nprevious computations and observations (e.g. Lalpha from UVCS) and find a rough\n(model-dependent) agreement. Since the Halpha line is a possible candidate for\nground-based polarimetry, we show that in order to detect its emission in\nvarious coronal structures, it is necessary to use a very narrow (less than 2 A\nwide) bandpass filter.\n", "  We present the results of SPT-GMOS, a spectroscopic survey with the Gemini\nMulti-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South. The targets of SPT-GMOS are\ngalaxy clusters identified in the SPT-SZ survey, a millimeter-wave survey of\n2500 squ. deg. of the southern sky using the South Pole Telescope (SPT).\nMulti-object spectroscopic observations of 62 SPT-selected galaxy clusters were\nperformed between January 2011 and December 2015, yielding spectra with radial\nvelocity measurements for 2595 sources. We identify 2243 of these sources as\ngalaxies, and 352 as stars. Of the galaxies, we identify 1579 as members of\nSPT-SZ galaxy clusters. The primary goal of these observations was to obtain\nspectra of cluster member galaxies to estimate cluster redshifts and velocity\ndispersions. We describe the full spectroscopic dataset and resulting data\nproducts, including galaxy redshifts, cluster redshifts and velocity\ndispersions, and measurements of several well-known spectral indices for each\ngalaxy: the equivalent width, W, of [O II] 3727,3729 and H-delta, and the 4000A\nbreak strength, D4000. We use the spectral indices to classify galaxies by\nspectral type (i.e., passive, post-starburst, star-forming), and we match the\nspectra against photometric catalogs to characterize spectroscopically-observed\ncluster members as a function of brightness (relative to m*). Finally, we\nreport several new measurements of redshifts for ten bright, strongly-lensed\nbackground galaxies in the cores of eight galaxy clusters. Combining the\nSPT-GMOS dataset with previous spectroscopic follow-up of SPT-SZ galaxy\nclusters results in spectroscopic measurements for >100 clusters, or ~20% of\nthe full SPT-SZ sample.\n", "  It is conventionally believed that if a ball of matter of mass $M$ has a\nradius close to $2GM$ then it must collapse to a black hole. But string theory\nmicrostates (fuzzballs) have no horizon or singularity, and they do {\\it not}\ncollapse. We consider two simple examples from classical gravity to illustrate\nhow this violation of our intuition happens. In each case the `matter' arises\nfrom an extra compact dimension, but the topology of this extra dimension is\nnot trivial. The pressure and density of this matter diverge at various points,\nbut this is only an artifact of dimensional reduction; thus we bypass results\nlike Buchadahl's theorem. Such microstates give the entropy of black holes, so\nthese topologically nontrivial constructions dominate the state space of\nquantum gravity.\n", "  We have developed an interactive PYTHON code and derived crucial ephemeris\ndata of 99.4% of all stars classified as 'Mira' in the ASAS data base,\nreferring to pulsation periods, mean maximum magnitudes and, whenever possible,\nthe amplitudes among others. We present a statistical comparison between our\nresults and those given by the AAVSO International Variable Star Index (VSX),\nas well as those determined with the machine learning automatic procedure of\nRichards et al. 2012. Our periods are in good agreement with those of the VSX\nin more than 95% of the stars. However, when comparing our periods with those\nof Richards et al, the coincidence rate is only 76% and most of the remaining\ncases refer to aliases. We conclude that automatic codes require still more\nrefinements in order to provide reliable period values. Period distributions of\nthe target stars show three local maxima around 215, 275 and 330 d, apparently\nof universal validity, their relative strength seems to depend on galactic\nlongitude. Our visual amplitude distribution turns out to be bimodal, however\n1/3 of the targets have rather small amplitudes (A $<$ 2.5$^{m}$) and could\nrefer to semi-regular variables (SR). We estimate that about 20% of our targets\nbelong to the SR class. We also provide a list of 63 candidates for period\nvariations and a sample of 35 multiperiodic stars which seem to confirm the\nuniversal validity of typical sequences in the double period and in the\nPetersen diagrams\n", "  We present the first results from an ongoing survey for multiplicity among\nthe bright stars using the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI). We\nfirst present a summary of NPOI observations of known multiple systems,\nincluding the first detection of the companion of $\\beta$ Scuti with precise\nrelative astrometry, to illustrate the instrument's detection sensitivity for\nbinaries at magnitude differences $\\Delta$$m$ $\\lessapprox$ 3 over the range of\nangular separation 3 - 860 milliarcseconds (mas). A limiting $\\Delta$$m_{700}$\n$\\sim$ 3.5 is likely for binaries where the component spectral types differ by\nless than two. Model fits to these data show good agreement with published\norbits, and we additionally present a new orbit solution for one of these\nstars, $\\sigma$ Her. We then discuss early results of the survey of bright\nstars at $\\delta$ $\\geq$ -20$\\deg$. This survey, which complements previous\nsurveys of the bright stars by speckle interferometry, initially emphasizes\nbright stars of spectral types F0 through K2. We report observations of 41\nstars of apparent visual magnitude $m_V$ $\\leq$ 4.30, all having been observed\non multiple nights. Analysis of these data produces fitted angular separations,\nposition angles, and component magnitude differences for six previously known\nvisual binaries. Three additional systems were examined as possible binaries,\nbut no conclusive detection could be made. No evidence of close stellar\ncompanions within our detection limit of $\\Delta$$m$ $\\approx$ 3 was found for\nthe remaining 32 stars observed; however, uniform-disk angular diameters are\nreported for 11 of the resolved stars in this last group.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the bright Cepheid-type variable star V1154\nCygni using 4 years of continuous observations by the Kepler space telescope.\nWe detected 28 frequencies using standard Fourier transform method.We\nidentified modulation of the main pulsation frequency and its harmonics with a\nperiod of ~159 d. This modulation is also present in the Fourier parameters of\nthe light curve and the O-C diagram. We detected another modulation with a\nperiod of about 1160 d. The star also shows significant power in the\nlow-frequency region that we identified as granulation noise. The effective\ntimescale of the granulation agrees with the extrapolated scalings of red giant\nstars. Non-detection of solar-like oscillations indicates that the pulsation\ninhibits other oscillations. We obtained new radial velocity observations which\nare in a perfect agreement with previous years data, suggesting that there is\nno high mass star companion of V1154 Cygni. Finally, we discuss the possible\norigin of the detected frequency modulations.\n", "  We present the Large Area Radio Galaxy Evolution Spectroscopic Survey\n(LARGESS), a spectroscopic catalogue of radio sources designed to include the\nfull range of radio AGN populations out to redshift z = 0.8. The catalogue\ncovers roughly 800 square degrees of sky, and provides optical identifications\nfor 19,179 radio sources from the 1.4 GHz Faint Images of the Radio Sky at\nTwenty-cm (FIRST) survey down to an optical magnitude limit of i_mod < 20.5 in\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. Both galaxies and point-like objects\nare included, and no colour cuts are applied. In collaboration with the WiggleZ\nand Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey teams, we have\nobtained new spectra for over 5,000 objects in the LARGESS sample. Combining\nthese new spectra with data from earlier surveys provides spectroscopic data\nfor 12,329 radio sources in the survey area, of which 10,856 have reliable\nredshifts. 85% of the LARGESS spectroscopic sample are radio AGN (median\nredshift z = 0.44), and 15% are nearby star-forming galaxies (median z = 0.08).\nLow-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) comprise the majority (83%) of LARGESS\nradio AGN at z < 0.8, with 12% being high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) and\n5% radio-loud QSOs. Unlike the more homogeneous LERG and QSO sub-populations,\nHERGs are a heterogeneous class of objects with relatively blue optical colours\nand a wide dispersion in mid-infrared colours. This is consistent with a\npicture in which most HERGs are hosted by galaxies with recent or ongoing star\nformation as well as a classical accretion disk.\n", "  Recently, ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M82 X-2 has been identified to be\nan accreting neutron star, which has a $P=1.37$ s spin period, and is spinning\nup at a rate $\\dot{P}=-2.0\\times 10^{-10}~\\rm s\\,s^{-1}$. Interestingly, its\nisotropic X-ray luminosity $L_{\\rm iso}=1.8\\times 10^{40}~\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$\nduring outbursts is 100 times the Eddington limit for a $1.4~\\rm M_{\\odot}$\nneutron star. In this Letter, based on the standard accretion model we attempt\nto constrain the dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar in ULX M82 X-2. Our\ncalculations indicate that the accretion rate at the magnetospheric radius must\nbe super-Eddington during outbursts. To support such a super-Eddington\naccretion, a relatively high multipole field ($\\ga 10^{13}$ G) near the surface\nof the accretor is invoked to produce an accreting gas column. However, our\nconstraint shows that the surface dipolar magnetic field of the pulsar should\nbe in the range of $1.0-3.5\\times 10^{12}$ G. Therefore, our model supports\nthat the neutron star in ULX M82 X-2 could be a low magnetic field magnetar\n(proposed by Tong) with a normal dipolar field ($\\sim 10^{12}$ G) and\nrelatively strong multipole field. For the large luminosity variations of this\nsource, our scenario can also present a self-consistency interpretation.\n", "  The Crab Pulsar has been recently detected at very high energies (VHE) with\nits pulsed VHE emission reaching up to $1.5$ TeV. The VHE peaks appear\nsynchronised with the peaks at GeV energies and show VHE spectra following hard\npower-law functions. These new findings have been interpreted as evidence for a\ngamma-ray production that happens very close to the light cylinder. Motivated\nby these experimental results we consider the efficiency of magnetocentrifugal\nparticle acceleration in the magnetosphere of the Crab Pulsar, reexamining and\nextending results obtained in a previous work (Osmanov & Rieger 2009). It is\nshown that efficient magnetocentrifugal acceleration close to the light\ncylinder could provide the required electron Lorentz factors of $5\\times 10^6$\nand that the resulting inverse Compton (IC) scattering off thermal photons\nmight explain the enigmatic TeV emission of the pulsar. We estimate the\ncorresponding VHE luminosity and provide a derivation of its spectral\ncharacteristics, that appear remarkably close to the observational results to\nencourage further studies.\n", "  Using a no-scale supergravity framework, we construct an SO(10) model that\nmakes predictions for cosmic microwave background observables similar to those\nof the Starobinsky model of inflation, and incorporates a double-seesaw model\nfor neutrino masses consistent with oscillation experiments and late-time\ncosmology. We pay particular attention to the behaviour of the scalar fields\nduring inflation and the subsequent reheating.\n", "  We report a correlation between the radial acceleration traced by rotation\ncurves and that predicted by the observed distribution of baryons. The same\nrelation is followed by 2693 points in 153 galaxies with very different\nmorphologies, masses, sizes, and gas fractions. The correlation persists even\nwhen dark matter dominates. Consequently, the dark matter contribution is fully\nspecified by that of the baryons. The observed scatter is small and largely\ndominated by observational uncertainties. This radial acceleration relation is\ntantamount to a natural law for rotating galaxies.\n", "  Sensors that are able to detect and track single unlabelled biomolecules are\nan important tool both to understand biomolecular dynamics and interactions at\nnanoscale, and for medical diagnostics operating at their ultimate detection\nlimits. Recently, exceptional sensitivity has been achieved using the strongly\nenhanced evanescent fields provided by optical microcavities and nano-sized\nplasmonic resonators. However, at high field intensities photodamage to the\nbiological specimen becomes increasingly problematic. Here, we introduce an\noptical nanofibre based evanescent biosensor that operates at the fundamental\nprecision limit introduced by quantisation of light. This allows a four\norder-of-magnitude reduction in optical intensity whilst maintaining\nstate-of-the-art sensitivity. It enable quantum noise limited tracking of\nsingle biomolecules as small as 3.5 nm, and surface-molecule interactions to be\nmonitored over extended periods. By achieving quantum noise limited precision,\nour approach provides a pathway towards quantum-enhanced single-molecule\nbiosensors.\n", "  Adiabatic oscillation frequencies of stellar models, computed with the\nstandard mixing-length formulation for convection, increasingly deviate with\nradial order from observations in solar-like stars. Standard solar models\noverestimate adiabatic frequencies by as much as ~ 20 {\\mu}Hz. In this letter,\nwe address the physical processes of turbulent convection that are\npredominantly responsible for the frequency differences between standard models\nand observations, also called `surface effects'. We compare measured solar\nfrequencies from the MDI instrument on the SOHO spacecraft with frequency\ncalculations that include three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulation\nresults in the equilibrium model, nonadiabatic effects, and a consistent\ntreatment of the turbulent pressure in both the equilibrium and stability\ncomputations. With the consistent inclusion of the above physics in our model\ncomputation we are able to reproduce the observed solar frequencies to < 3\n{\\mu}Hz without the need of any additional ad-hoc functional corrections.\n", "  The majority of cataclysmic variable (CV) stars contain a stochastic noise\ncomponent in their light curves, commonly referred to as flickering. This can\nsignificantly affect the morphology of CV eclipses and increases the difficulty\nin obtaining accurate system parameters with reliable errors through eclipse\nmodelling. Here we introduce a new approach to eclipse modelling, which models\nCV flickering with the help of Gaussian processes (GPs). A parameterised\neclipse model - with an additional GP component - is simultaneously fit to 8\neclipses of the dwarf nova ASASSN-14ag and system parameters determined. We\nobtain a mass ratio $q$ = 0.149 $\\pm$ 0.016 and inclination $i$ = 83.4\n$^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ $^{\\circ}$. The white dwarf and donor masses were found to be\n$M_{w}$ = 0.63 $\\pm$ 0.04 $M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{d}$ = 0.093 $^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, respectively. A white dwarf temperature $T_{w}$ = 14000\n$^{+2200}_{-2000}$ K and distance $d$ = 146 $^{+24}_{-20}$ pc were determined\nthrough multicolour photometry. We find GPs to be an effective way of modelling\nflickering in CV light curves and plan to use this new eclipse modelling\napproach going forward.\n", "  Recent analysis of strongly-lensed sources in the Hubble Frontier Fields\nindicates that the rest-frame UV luminosity function of galaxies at $z=$6--8\nrises as a power law down to $M_\\mathrm{UV}=-15$, and possibly as faint as\n-12.5. We use predictions from a cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulation\nto map these luminosities onto physical space, constraining the minimum dark\nmatter halo mass and stellar mass that the Frontier Fields probe. While\npreviously-published theoretical studies have suggested or assumed that early\nstar formation was suppressed in halos less massive than $10^9$--$10^{11}\nM_\\odot$, we find that recent observations demand vigorous star formation in\nhalos at least as massive as (3.1, 5.6, 10.5)$\\times10^9 M_\\odot$ at\n$z=(6,7,8)$. Likewise, we find that Frontier Fields observations probe down to\nstellar masses of (8.1, 18, 32)$\\times10^6 M_\\odot$; that is, they are\nobserving the likely progenitors of analogues to Local Group dwarfs such as\nPegasus and M32. Our simulations yield somewhat different constraints than two\ncomplementary models that have been invoked in similar analyses, emphasizing\nthe need for further observational constraints on the galaxy-halo connection.\n", "  There are only a few known main belt (MB) asteroid families with ages greater\nthan 2 Gyr (Bro\\v{z} et al. 2013, Spoto et al. 2015). Estimates based on the\nfamily producing collision rate suggest that the lack of >2 Gyr-old families\nmay be due to a selection bias in current techniques used to identify families.\nFamily fragments disperse in their orbital elements, semi-major axis, $a$,\neccentricity, $e$, and inclination, $i$, due to secular resonances, close\nencounters with massive asteroids and the non-gravitational Yarkovsky force.\nThis causes the family fragments to be indistinguishable from the background of\nthe main belt making them more difficult to identify with the hierarchical\nclustering method (HCM) with increasing family age. The discovery of the\nEulalia and new Polana families in the inner belt relied on new techniques\nbecause Yarkovsky spreading made them too disperse to be identified using the\nclassical HCM. The technique used to discover the new Polana and Eulalia\nfamilies is modified to identify asteroid families by searching for\ncorrelations between $a$ and asteroid diameter, $D$, or absolute magnitude,\n$H$. A group of asteroids is identified as a collisional family if its boundary\nin the $a$ vs. 1/$D$ or $a$ vs. $H$ planes has a characteristic V-shape which\nis due to the size dependent Yarkovsky spreading. The V-shape boundary is\nidentified with two separate techniques. The first identifies a border by\nmeasuring the drop between the number of objects inside and outside of the\nborder. The second identifies the V-shape border by measuring the number\ndensity of objects in $a$ vs. 1/$D$,$H$ space. The V-shape techniques are\ndemonstrated on known families Erigone, Vesta, Koronis, and families difficult\nto identify by HCM such as Flora, Baptistina, new Polana, Eulalia and Karin.\nApplication of the technique in a search for >2 Gyr-old families throughout the\nMB is discussed.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new Kepler first-overtone RR Lyrae pulsator, KIC\n2831097. The pulsation shows large, 0.1 d amplitude, systematic phase\nvariations that can be interpreted as light travel-time effect caused by\norbital motion in a binary system, superimposed on a linear pulsation-period\ndecrease. The assumed eccentric (e=0.47) orbit with the period of approximately\n2 yr is the shortest among the non-eclipsing RR Lyrae binary candidates. The\nbinary model gives a lowest estimate for the mass of the companion of 8.4\nM_Sun, that places it among black hole candidates. Beside the first-overtone\npulsation, numerous additional non-radial pulsation frequencies were also\nidentified. We detected an ~47-d Blazhko-like irregular light-curve modulation.\n", "  Abell 2146 consists of two galaxy clusters that have recently collided close\nto the plane of the sky, and it is unique in showing two large shocks on\n$\\textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory}$ images. With an early stage merger,\nshortly after first core passage, one would expect the cluster galaxies and the\ndark matter to be leading the X-ray emitting plasma. In this regard, the\ncluster Abell 2146-A is very unusual in that the X-ray cool core appears to\nlead, rather than lag, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in their\ntrajectories. Here we present a strong lensing analysis of multiple image\nsystems identified on $\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ images. In particular,\nwe focus on the distribution of mass in Abell 2146-A in order to determine the\ncentroid of the dark matter halo. We use object colours and morphologies to\nidentify multiple image systems; very conservatively, four of these systems are\nused as constraints on a lens mass model. We find that the centroid of the dark\nmatter halo, constrained using the strongly lensed features, is coincident with\nthe BCG, with an offset of $\\approx$ 2 kpc between the centres of the dark\nmatter halo and the BCG. Thus from the strong lensing model, the X-ray cool\ncore also leads the centroid of the dark matter in Abell 2146-A, with an offset\nof $\\approx$ 30 kpc.\n", "  Radial and azimuthal features (such as disc offsets and eccentric rings) seen\nin high resolution images of debris discs, provide us with the unique\nopportunity of finding potential planetary companions which betray their\npresence by gravitationally sculpting such asymmetric features. The young\ndebris disc around HD 115600, imaged recently by the Gemini Planet Imager, is\nsuch a disc with an eccentricity 0.1<e<0.2 and a projected offset from the star\nof 4 AU. Using our modified N-body code which incorporates radiation forces, we\nfirstly aim to determine the orbit of a hidden planetary companion potentially\nresponsible for shaping the disc. We run a suite of simulations covering a\nbroad range of planetary parameters using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling\nmethod and create synthetic images from which we extract the geometric disc\nparameters to be compared with the observed and model-derived quantities. We\nthen repeat the study using a traditional grid to explore the planetary\nparameter space and aim secondly to compare the efficiency of both sampling\nmethods. We find a planet of 7.8 Jupiter mass orbiting at 30 AU with an\neccentricity of e = 0.2 to be the best fit to the observations of HD 115600.\nTechnically, such planet has a contrast detectable by direct imaging, however\nthe system's orientation does not favour such detection. In this study, at\nequal number of explored planetary configurations, the Monte Carlo Markov Chain\nnot only converges faster but provides a better fit than a traditional grid.\n", "  We compare radio profile widths of young, energetic gamma-ray-detected and\nnon-gamma-ray-detected pulsars. We find that the latter typically have wider\nradio profiles, with the boundary between the two samples exhibiting a\ndependence on the rate of rotational energy loss. We also find that within the\nsample of gamma-ray-detected pulsars, radio profile width is correlated with\nboth the separation of the main gamma-ray peaks and the presence of narrow\ngamma-ray components. These findings lead us to propose that these pulsars form\na single population where the main factors determining gamma ray detectability\nare the rate of rotational energy loss and the proximity of the line of sight\nto the rotation axis. The expected magnetic inclination angle distribution will\nbe different for radio pulsars with and without detectable gamma rays,\nnaturally leading to the observed differences. Our results also suggest that\nthe geometry of existing radio and outer-magnetosphere gamma-ray emission\nmodels are at least qualitatively realistic, implying that information about\nthe viewing geometry can be extracted from profile properties of pulsars.\n", "  We confront the indications of lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation\nobserved in semi-tauonic $B$ meson decays with new physics (NP) searches using\nhigh $p_T$ tau leptons at the LHC. Using effective field theory arguments we\ncorrelate possible non-standard contributions to semi-tauonic charged currents\nwith the $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ signature at high energy hadron colliders. Several\nrepresentative standard model extensions put forward to explain the anomaly are\nexamined in detail: (i) weak triplet of color-neutral vector resonances, (ii)\nsecond Higgs doublet and (iii) scalar or (iv) vector leptoquark. We find that,\nin general, $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ searches pose a serious challenge to NP\nexplanations of the LFU anomaly. Recasting existing 8 TeV and 13 TeV LHC\nanalyses, stringent limits are set on all considered simplified models. Future\nprojections of the $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ constraints as well as caveats in\ninterpreting them within more elaborate models are also discussed.\n", "  We show that non-magnetic models for the evolution of pre-main-sequence (PMS)\nstars *cannot* simultaneously describe the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) and\nthe pattern of lithium depletion seen in the cluster of young, low-mass stars\nsurrounding $\\gamma^2$ Velorum. The age of 7.5+/-1 Myr inferred from the CMD is\nmuch younger than that implied by the strong Li depletion seen in the cluster\nM-dwarfs and the Li depletion occurs at much redder colours than predicted. The\nepoch at which a star of a given mass depletes its Li and the surface\ntemperature of that star are both dependent on its radius. We demonstrate that\nif the low-mass stars have radii ~10 per cent larger at a given mass and age,\nthen both the CMD and Li depletion pattern of the Gamma Vel cluster are\nexplained at a common age of 18-21 Myr. This radius inflation could be produced\nby some combination of magnetic suppression of convection and extensive cool\nstarspots. Models that incorporate radius inflation suggest that PMS stars\nsimilar to those in the Gamma Vel cluster, in the range 0.2<M/Msun<0.7, are at\nleast a factor of two older and ~7 per cent cooler than previously thought and\nthat their masses are much larger (by >30 per cent) than inferred from\nconventional, non-magnetic models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nSystematic changes of this size may be of great importance in understanding the\nevolution of young stars, disc lifetimes and the formation of planetary\nsystems.\n", "  Infrared observations of the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko were carried\nout from July to September 2015, i.e., around perihelion (13 August 2015), with\nthe high-resolution channel of the VIRTIS instrument onboard Rosetta. We\npresent the analysis of fluorescence emission lines of H$_2$O, CO$_2$,\n$^{13}$CO$_2$, OCS, and CH$_4$ detected in limb sounding with the field of view\nat 2.7-5 km from the comet centre. Measurements are sampling outgassing from\nthe illuminated southern hemisphere, as revealed by H$_2$O and CO$_2$ raster\nmaps, which show anisotropic distributions, aligned along the projected\nrotation axis. An abrupt increase of water production is observed six days\nafter perihelion. In the mean time, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and OCS abundances relative\nto water increased by a factor of 2 to reach mean values of 32%, 0.47%, and\n0.18%, respectively, averaging post-perihelion data. We interpret these changes\nas resulting from the erosion of volatile-poor surface layers. Sustained dust\nablation due to the sublimation of water ice maintained volatile-rich layers\nnear the surface until at least the end of the considered period, as expected\nfor low thermal inertia surface layers. The large abundance measured for CO$_2$\nshould be representative of the 67P nucleus original composition, and indicates\nthat 67P is a CO$_2$-rich comet. Comparison with abundance ratios measured in\nthe northern hemisphere shows that seasons play an important role in comet\noutgassing. The low CO$_2$/H$_2$O values measured above the illuminated\nnorthern hemisphere are not original, but the result of the devolatilization of\nthe uppermost layers.\n", "  We present new MUSE observations of quasar field Q2131-1207 with a log\nN(HI)=19.50+/-0.15 sub-DLA at z_abs=0.42980. We detect four galaxies at a\nredshift consistent with that of the absorber where only one was known before\nthis study. Two of these are star forming galaxies, while the ones further away\nfrom the quasar (>140 kpc) are passive galaxies. We report the metallicities of\nthe HII regions of the closest objects (12+log(O/H)=8.98+/-0.02 and\n8.32+/-0.16) to be higher or equivalent within the errors to the metallicity\nmeasured in absorption in the neutral phase of the gas (8.15+/-0.20). For the\nclosest object, a detailed morpho-kinematic analysis indicates that it is an\ninclined large rotating disk with V_max=200+/-3 km/s. We measure the masses to\nbe M_dyn=7.4+/-0.4 x 10^10 M_sun and M_halo=2.9+/-0.2 x 10^12 M_sun. Some of\nthe gas seen in absorption is likely to be co-rotating with the halo of that\nobject, possibly due to a warped disk. The azimuthal angle between the quasar\nline of sight and the projected major axis of the galaxy on the sky is 12+/-1\ndegrees which indicates that some other fraction of the absorbing gas might be\nassociated with accreting gas. This is further supported by the galaxy to gas\nmetallicity difference. Based on the same arguments, we exclude outflows as a\npossibility to explain the gas in absorption. The four galaxies form a large\nstructure (at least 200 kpc wide) consistent with a filament or a galaxy group\nso that a fraction of the absorption could be related to intra-group gas.\n", "  The neutron star low-mass X-ray binary and intermittent millisecond X-ray\npulsar HETE J1900.1-2455 returned to quiescence in late 2015, after a prolonged\naccretion outburst of ~10 yr. Using a Chandra observation taken ~180 d into\nquiescence we detect the source at a luminosity of ~4.5E31 (D/4.7 kpc)^2 erg/s\n(0.5-10 keV). The X-ray spectrum can be described by a neutron star atmosphere\nmodel with a temperature of ~54 eV for an observer at infinity. We perform\nthermal evolution calculations based on the 2016 quiescent data and a <98 eV\ntemperature upper limit inferred from a Swift observation taken during an\nunusually brief (<2 weeks) quiescent episode in 2007. We find no evidence in\nthe present data that the thermal properties of the crust, such as the heating\nrate and thermal conductivity, are different than those of non-pulsating\nneutron stars. Finding this neutron star so cold after its long outburst\nimposes interesting constraints on the heat capacity of the stellar core; these\nbecome even stronger if further cooling were to occur.\n", "  We analyze 45 spectropolarimetric observations of the eclipsing, interacting\nbinary star V356 Sgr, obtained over a period of 21 years, to characterize the\ngeometry of the system's circumstellar material. After removing interstellar\npolarization from these data, we find the system exhibits a large intrinsic\npolarization signature arising from electron scattering. In addition, the lack\nof repeatable eclipses in the polarization phase curves indicates the presence\nof a substantial pool of scatterers not occulted by either star. We suggest\nthat these scatterers form either a circumbinary disk coplanar with the\ngainer's accretion disk or an elongated structure perpendicular to the orbital\nplane of V356 Sgr, possibly formed by bipolar outflows. We also observe\nsmall-scale, cycle-to-cycle variations in the magnitude of intrinsic\npolarization at individual phases, which we interpret as evidence of\nvariability in the amount of scattering material present within and around the\nsystem. This may indicate a mass transfer or mass loss rate that varies on the\ntime-scale of the system's orbital period. Finally, we compare the basic\npolarimetric properties of V356 Sgr with those of the well studied beta Lyr\nsystem; the significant differences observed between the two systems suggests\ndiversity in the basic circumstellar geometry of Roche-lobe overflow systems\n", "  To obtain the most accurate pulse arrival times from radio pulsars, it is\nnecessary to correct or mitigate the effects of the propagation of radio waves\nthrough the warm and ionised interstellar medium. We examine both the strength\nof propagation effects associated with large-scale electron-density variations\nand the methodology used to estimate infinite-frequency arrival times. Using\nsimulations of two-dimensional phase-varying screens, we assess the strength\nand non-stationarity of timing perturbations associated with large-scale\ndensity variations. We identify additional contributions to arrival times that\nare stochastic in both radio frequency and time and therefore not amenable to\ncorrection solely using times of arrival. We attribute this to the frequency\ndependence of the trajectories of the propagating radio waves. We find that\nthis limits the efficacy of low-frequency (metre-wavelength) observations.\nIncorporating low-frequency pulsar observations into precision timing campaigns\nis increasingly problematic for pulsars with larger dispersion measures.\n", "  We report on C-band (5 - 7 GHz) observations of the galaxy, NGC~2992, from\nthe CHANG-ES sample. This galaxy displays an embedded nuclear double-lobed\nradio morphology within its spiral disk, as revealed in linearly polarized\nemission but {\\it not} in total intensity emission. The radio lobes are\nkpc-sized, similar to what has been observed in the past for other Seyfert\ngalaxies, and show ordered magnetic fields. NGC~2992 has shown previous\nevidence for AGN-related activity, but not the linearly polarized radio\nfeatures that we present here. We draw attention to this galaxy as the first\nclear example (and prototype) of bipolar radio outflow that is revealed in\nlinearly polarized emission only. Such polarization observations, which are\nunobscured by dust, provide a new tool for uncovering hidden weak AGN activity\nwhich may otherwise be masked by brighter unpolarized emission within which it\nis embedded. The radio lobes observed in NGC~2992 are interacting with the\nsurrounding interstellar medium and offer new opportunities to investigate the\ninteractions between nuclear outflows and the ISM in nearby galaxies. We also\ncompare the radio emission with a new CHANDRA X-ray image of this galaxy. A new\nCHANG-ES image of NGC~3079 is also briefly shown as another example as to how\nmuch more obvious radio lobes appear in linear polarization as opposed to total\nintensity.\n", "  Using a simplified one-dimensional model of a diatomic molecule, the\nassociated interacting density and corresponding Kohn-Sham potential have been\nobtained analytically for all fractional molecule occupancies $N$ between 0 and\n2. For the homonuclear case, and in the dissociation limit, the exact Kohn-Sham\npotential builds a barrier at the midpoint between the two atoms, whose\nstrength increases linearly with $N$, with $1 < N \\leq 2$. In the heteronuclear\ncase, the disociating KS potential besides the barrier also exhibits a plateau\naround the atom with the higher ionization potential, whose size (but not its\nstrength) depends on $N$. An anomalous zero-order scaling of the Kohn-Sham\npotential with regards to the strength of the electron-electron repulsion is\nclearly displayed by our model; without this property both the unusual barrier\nand plateau features will be absent.\n", "  Transition-region explosive events (EEs) are characterized by non-Gaussian\nline profiles with enhanced wings at Doppler velocities of 50-150 km/s. They\nare believed to be the signature of solar phenomena that are one of the main\ncontributors to coronal heating. The aim of this study is to investigate the\nlink of EEs to dynamic phenomena in the transition region and chromosphere in\nan active region. We analyze observations simultaneously taken by the Interface\nRegion Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in the Si IV 1394\\AA\\ line and the slit-jaw\n(SJ) 1400\\AA\\ images, and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) in the\nH$\\alpha$ line. In total 24 events were found. They are associated with\nsmall-scale loop brightenings in SJ 1400\\AA\\ images. Only four events show a\ncounterpart in the H$\\alpha$-35 km/s and H$\\alpha$+35 km/s images. Two of them\nrepresent brightenings in the conjunction region of several loops that are also\nrelated to a bright region (granular lane) in the H$\\alpha$-35km/s and\nH$\\alpha$+35 km/s images. Sixteen are general loop brightenings that do not\nshow any discernible response in the H$\\alpha$ images. Six EEs appear as\npropagating loop brightenings, from which two are associated with dark jet-like\nfeatures clearly seen in the H$\\alpha$-35 km/s images. We found that\nchromospheric events with jet-like appearance seen in the wings of the\nH$\\alpha$ line can trigger EEs in the transition region and in this case the\nIRIS Si IV 1394\\AA\\ line profiles are seeded with absorption components\nresulting from Fe II and Ni II. Our study indicates that EEs occurring in\nactive regions have mostly upper-chromosphere/transition-region origin. We\nsuggest that magnetic reconnection resulting from the braidings of small-scale\ntransition region loops is one of the possible mechanisms of energy release\nthat are responsible for the EEs reported in this paper.\n", "  Experiments with networks of discrete reactive bistable electrochemical\nelements organized in regular and nonregular tree networks are presented to\nconfirm an alternative to the Turing mechanism for the formation of\nself-organized stationary patterns. The results show that the pattern formation\ncan be described by the identification of domains that can be activated\nindividually or in combinations. The method also enabled the localization of\nchemical reactions to network substructures and the identification of critical\nsites whose activation results in complete activation of the system. Although\nthe experiments were performed with a specific nickel electrodissolution\nsystem, they reproduced all the salient dynamic behavior of a general network\nmodel with a single nonlinearity parameter. Thus, the considered\npattern-formation mechanism is very robust, and similar behavior can be\nexpected in other natural or engineered networked systems that exhibit, at\nleast locally, a treelike structure.\n", "  We present wide field JHKs photometry of 16 Galactic globular clusters\nlocated towards the Galactic bulge, calibrated on the 2MASS photometric system.\nDifferential reddening corrections and statistical field star decontamination\nare employed for all of these clusters before fitting fiducial sequences to the\ncluster red giant branches (RGBs). Observed values and uncertainties are\nreported for several photometric features, including the magnitude of the RGB\nbump, tip, the horizontal branch (HB) and the slope of the upper RGB. The\nlatest spectroscopically determined chemical abundances are used to build\ndistance- and reddening-independent relations between observed photometric\nfeatures and cluster metallicity, optimizing the sample size and metallicity\nbaseline of these relations by supplementing our sample with results from the\nliterature. We find that the magnitude different between the HB and the RGB\nbump can be used to predict metallicities, in terms of both iron abundance\n[Fe/H] and global metallicity [M/H], with a precision of better than 0.1 dex in\nall three near-IR bandpasses for relative metal-rich ([M/H]$\\gtrsim$-1)\nclusters. Meanwhile, both the slope of the upper RGB and the magnitude\ndifference between the RGB tip and bump are useful metallicity indicators over\nthe entire sampled metallicity range (-2$\\lesssim$[M/H]$\\lesssim$0) with a\nprecision of 0.2 dex or better, despite model predictions that the RGB slope\nmay become unreliable at high (near-solar) metallicities. Our results agree\nwith previous calibrations in light of the relevant uncertainties, and we\ndiscuss implications for clusters with controversial metallicities as well as\ndirections for further investigation.\n", "  Supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 is well known for its bright TeV\ngamma-ray emission with shell-like morphology. To constrain the hydrodynamical\nevolution, we have performed six times observations of the northwestern (NW)\nshell with the Chandra X-ray Observatory from 2005 to 2011, and measured the\nproper motion by using these data and the first epoch observation taken in\n2000. The blast-wave shock speed at the NW shell is measured to be $(3900\\pm\n300) (d/{\\rm kpc})\\ {\\rm km}\\ {\\rm s}^{-1}$ with an estimated distance of $d =\n1$ kpc, and the proper motions of other structures within the NW shell are\nsignificantly less than that. Assuming that the measured blast-wave shock speed\nis the representative of the remnant's outer shock wave as a whole, we have\nconfronted our measurements as well as a recent detection of thermal X-ray\nlines, with the analytic solution of the hydrodynamical properties of SNRs. Our\nhydrodynamical analysis indicates that the age of the remnant is 1580-2100\nyears, supporting the association with SN393. A model with SN kinetic energy of\n$E = 10^{51}\\, \\rm erg$, the ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} = 3\\, M_{\\odot}$, and\nthe ambient density at the current blast wave location of $n_2 = 0.015\\, {\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$, provides reasonable explanation for our measurements and previous\nfindings at the X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. We find that the transition to\nthe Sedov-Taylor (ST) phase is incomplete for any reasonable set of parameters,\nimplying that the current maximum energy of accelerated protons in RX\nJ1713.7-3946 would not correspond to the maximum attainable energy for this\nremnant.\n", "  In protoplanetary disks the aerodynamical friction between particles and gas\ninduces a variety of instabilities that facilitate planet formation. Of these\nwe examine the so-called `secular gravitational instability' (SGI) in the\ntwo-fluid approximation, deriving analytical expressions for its stability\ncriteria and growth rates. Concurrently, we present a physical explanation of\nthe instability that shows how it manifests upon an intermediate range of\nlengthscales exhibiting geostrophic balance in the gas component. In contrast\nto a single-fluid treatment, the SGI is quenched within a critical disk radius,\nas large as 10 AU and 30 AU for cm and mm sized particles respectively,\nalthough establishing robust estimates is hampered by uncertainties in the\nparameters (especially the strength of turbulence) and deficiencies in the\nrazor-thin disk model we employ. It is unlikely, however, that the SGI is\nrelevant for well-coupled dust. We conclude by applying these results to the\nquestion of planetesimal formation and the provenance of large-scale dust\nrings.\n", "  We investigate whether the rings, lopsided features and horseshoes observed\nat millimetre wavelengths in transitional discs can be explained by the\ndynamics of gas and dust at the edge of the cavity in circumbinary discs. We\nuse 3D dusty smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations to show that binaries\nwith mass ratio $q \\gtrsim 0.04$ drive eccentricity in the central cavity,\nnaturally leading to a crescent-like feature in the gas density, which is\naccentuated in the mm dust grain population with intensity contrasts in\nmm-continuum emission of 10 or higher. We perform mock observations to\ndemonstrate that these features closely match those observed by ALMA,\nsuggesting that the origin of rings, dust horseshoes and other non-axisymmetric\nstructures in transition discs can be explained by the presence of massive\ncompanions.\n", "  Peculiar velocity surveys present a very promising route to measuring the\ngrowth rate of large-scale structure and its scale dependence. However,\nindividual peculiar velocity surveys suffer from large statistical errors due\nto the intrinsic scatter in the relations used to infer a galaxy's true\ndistance. In this context we use a Fisher Matrix formalism to investigate the\nstatistical benefits of combining multiple peculiar velocity surveys. We find\nthat for all cases we consider there is a marked improvement on constraints on\nthe linear growth rate $f\\sigma_{8}$. For example, the constraining power of\nonly a few peculiar velocity measurements is such that the addition of the\n2MASS Tully-Fisher survey (containing only $\\sim2,000$ galaxies) to the full\nredshift and peculiar velocity samples of the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey\n(containing $\\sim 110,000$ redshifts and $\\sim 9,000$ velocities) can improve\ngrowth rate constraints by $\\sim20\\%$. Furthermore, the combination of the\nfuture TAIPAN and WALLABY+WNSHS surveys has the potential to reach a $\\sim3\\%$\nerror on $f\\sigma_{8}$, which will place tight limits on possible extensions to\nGeneral Relativity. We then turn to look at potential systematics in growth\nrate measurements that can arise due to incorrect calibration of the peculiar\nvelocity zero-point and from scale-dependent spatial and velocity bias. For\nnext generation surveys, we find that neglecting velocity bias in particular\nhas the potential to bias constraints on the growth rate by over $5\\sigma$, but\nthat an offset in the zero-point has negligible impact on the velocity power\nspectrum.\n", "  We present high field magnetoresistance, Hall effect and thermopower\nmeasurements in the Ising-type ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe. Magnetic\nfield is applied along the easy magnetization $c$ axis of the orthorhombic\ncrystal. In the different experimental probes we observed five successive\nanomalies at $H \\approx 4$, 9, 12, 16, and 21~T. Magnetic quantum oscillations\nwere detected both in resistivity and thermoelectric power. At most of the\nanomalies, significant changes of the oscillation frequencies and the effective\nmasses have been observed indicating successive Fermi surface instabilities\ninduced by the strong magnetic polarization under magnetic field.\n", "  We investigate the observed relationship between black hole mass ($M_{\\rm\nBH}$), bolometric luminosity ($L_{\\rm bol}$), and Eddington ratio\n(${\\lambda}_{\\rm Edd}$) with optical emission line ratios ([NII]\n{\\lambda}6583/H{\\alpha}, [SII] {\\lambda}{\\lambda}6716,6731/H{\\alpha}, [OI]\n{\\lambda}6300/H{\\alpha}, [OIII] {\\lambda}5007/H{\\beta}, [NeIII]\n{\\lambda}3869/H{\\beta}, and HeII {\\lambda}4686/H{\\beta}) of hard X-ray-selected\nAGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). We show that the [NII]\n{\\lambda}6583/H{\\alpha} ratio exhibits a significant correlation with\n${\\lambda}_{\\rm Edd}$ ($R_{\\rm Pear}$ = -0.44, $p$-value=$3\\times10^{-13}$,\n{\\sigma} = 0.28 dex), and the correlation is not solely driven by $M_{\\rm BH}$\nor $L_{\\rm bol}$. The observed correlation between [NII]\n{\\lambda}6583/H{\\alpha} ratio and $M_{\\rm BH}$ is stronger than the correlation\nwith $L_{\\rm bol}$, but both are weaker than the ${\\lambda}_{\\rm Edd}$\ncorrelation. This implies that the large-scale narrow lines of AGN host\ngalaxies carry information about the accretion state of the AGN central engine.\nWe propose that the [NII] {\\lambda}6583/H{\\alpha} is a useful indicator of\nEddington ratio with 0.6 dex of rms scatter, and that it can be used to measure\n${\\lambda}_{\\rm Edd}$ and thus $M_{\\rm BH}$ from the measured $L_{\\rm bol}$,\neven for high redshift obscured AGN. We briefly discuss possible physical\nmechanisms behind this correlation, such as the mass-metallicity relation,\nX-ray heating, and radiatively driven outflows.\n", "  We infer the central mass distributions within 0.4-1.2 disc scale lengths of\n18 late-type spiral galaxies using two different dynamical modelling approaches\n- the Asymmetric Drift Correction (ADC) and axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic\nMulti-gaussian expansion (JAM) model. ADC adopts a thin disc assumption,\nwhereas JAM does a full line-of-sight velocity integration. We use stellar\nkinematics maps obtained with the integral-field spectrograph SAURON to derive\nthe corresponding circular velocity curves from the two models. To find their\nbest-fit values, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. ADC and JAM\nmodelling approaches are consistent within 5% uncertainty when the ordered\nmotions are significant comparable to the random motions, i.e,\n$\\overline{v_{\\phi}}/\\sigma_R$ is locally greater than 1.5. Below this value,\nthe ratio $v_\\mathrm{c,JAM}/v_\\mathrm{c,ADC}$ gradually increases with\ndecreasing $\\overline{v_{\\phi}}/\\sigma_R$, reaching $v_\\mathrm{c,JAM}\\approx 2\n\\times v_\\mathrm{c,ADC}$. Such conditions indicate that the stellar masses of\nthe galaxies in our sample are not confined to their disk planes and likely\nhave a non-negligible contribution from their bulges and thick disks.\n", "  We investigate the two-dimensional $q=3$ and 4 Potts models with a variable\ninteraction range by means of Monte Carlo simulations. We locate the phase\ntransitions for several interaction ranges as expressed by the number $z$ of\nequivalent neighbors. For not too large $z$, the transitions fit well in the\nuniversality classes of the short-range Potts models. However, at longer ranges\nthe transitions become discontinuous. For $q=3$ we locate a tricritical point\nseparating the continuous and discontinuous transitions near $z=80$, and a\ncritical fixed point between $z=8$ and 12. For $q=4$ the transition becomes\ndiscontinuous for $z > 16$. The scaling behavior of the $q=4$ model with $z=16$\napproximates that of the $q=4$ merged critical-tricritical fixed point\npredicted by the renormalization scenario.\n", "  We study the conditions for the onset of Thermal Instability in the innermost\nregions of compact galactic nuclei, where the properties of the interstellar\nenvironment are governed by the interplay of quasi-spherical accretion onto a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) and the heating/cooling processes of gas in a\ndense nuclear star cluster. Stellar winds are the source of material for\nradiatively inefficient (quasi-spherical, non-magnetised) inflow/outflow onto\nthe central SMBH, where a stagnation point develops within the Bondi type\naccretion. We study the local thermal equilibrium to determine the parameter\nspace which allows cold and hot phases in mutual contact to co-exist. We\ninclude the effects of mechanical heating by stellar winds and radiative\ncooling/heating by the ambient field of the dense star cluster. We consider two\nexamples: the Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) in the Milky Way central region\n(including the gaseous Mini-spiral of Sgr~A*), and the Ultra-Compact Dwarf\ngalaxy M60-UCD1. We find that the two systems behave in different ways because\nthey are placed in different areas of parameter space in the instability\ndiagram: gas temperature vs. dynamical ionization parameter. In the case of\nSgr~A*, stellar heating prevents the spontaneous formation of cold clouds. The\nplasma from stellar winds joins the hot X-ray emitting phase and forms an\noutflow. In M60-UCD1 our model predicts spontaneous formation of cold clouds in\nthe inner part of the galaxy. These cold clouds may survive since the cooling\ntimescale is shorter than the inflow/outflow timescale.\n", "  Apparent exponential surface density profiles are nearly universal in galaxy\ndiscs across Hubble types, over a wide mass range, and a diversity of\ngravitational potential forms. Several processes have been found to produce\nexponential profiles, including the actions of bars and spirals, and clump\nscattering, with star scattering a common theme in these. Based on reasonable\nphysical constraints, such as minimal entropy gradients, we propose steady\nstate distribution functions for disc stars, applicable over a range of\ngravitational potentials. The resulting surface density profiles are generally\na power-law term times a Sersic-type exponential. Over a modest range of Sersic\nindex values, these profiles are often indistinguishable from Type I\nexponentials, except at the innermost radii. However, in certain parameter\nranges these steady states can appear as broken, Type II or III profiles. The\ncorresponding velocity dispersion profiles are low order power-laws. A chemical\npotential associated with scattering can help understand the effects of long\nrange scattering. The steady profiles are found to persist through constant\nvelocity expansions or contractions in evolving discs. The proposed\ndistributions and profiles are simple and solve the stellar hydrodynamic\nequations. They may be especially relevant to thick discs, which have settled\nto a steady form via scattering.\n", "  We present high-angular (0.17$-$0.35 arcsec) resolution imaging polarimetric\nobservations of Mrk 231 in the 3.1 $\\mu$m filter using MMT-Pol on the 6.5-m\nMMT, and in the 8.7 $\\mu$m, 10.3 $\\mu$m, and 11.6 $\\mu$m filters using\nCanariCam on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS. In combination with already\npublished observations, we compile the 1$-$12 $\\mu$m total and polarized\nnuclear spectral energy distribution (SED). The total flux SED in the central\n400 pc is explained as the combination of 1) a hot (731 $\\pm$ 4 K) dusty\nstructure, directly irradiated by the central engine, which is at 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.1\npc away and attributed to be in the pc-scale polar region, 2) an\noptically-thick, smooth and disk-like dusty structure (`torus') with an\ninclination of 48 $\\pm$ 23$^{\\circ}$ surrounding the central engine, and 3) an\nextinguished (A$_{\\mbox{V}} =$ 36 $\\pm$ 5 mag) starburst component. The\npolarized SED decreases from 0.77 $\\pm$ 0.14 per cent at 1.2 $\\mu$m to 0.31\n$\\pm$ 0.15 per cent at 11.6 $\\mu$m and follows a power-law function,\n$\\lambda^{\\sim0.57}$. The polarization angle remains constant\n($\\sim$108$^{\\circ}$) in the 1$-$12 $\\mu$m wavelength range. The dominant\npolarization mechanism is explained as scattering off hot dust grains in the\npc-scale polar regions.\n", "  The spectral anisotropy of turbulent structures has been measured in the\nsolar wind since 1990, relying on the assumption of axisymmetry about the mean\nmagnetic field, B0. However, several works indicate that this hypothesis might\nbe partially wrong, thus raising two questions: (i) is it correct to interpret\nmeasurements at 1 AU (the so-called Maltese cross) in term of a sum of slab and\n2D turbulence? (ii) what information is really contained in the Maltese cross?\n  We solve direct numerical simulations of the MHD equations including the\ntransverse stretching exerted by the solar wind flow and study the genuine 3D\nanisotropy of turbulence as well as that one resulting from the assumption of\naxisymmetry about B0. We show that the evolution of the turbulent spectrum from\n0.2 to 1 AU depends strongly on its initial anisotropy. An axisymmetric\nspectrum with respect to B0 keeps its axisymmetry, i.e., resists stretching\nperpendicular to radial, while an isotropic spectrum becomes essentially\naxisymmetric with respect to the radial direction.\n  We conclude that close to the Sun, slow-wind turbulence has a spectrum that\nis axisymmetric around B0 and the measured 2D component at 1 AU describes the\nreal shape of turbulent structures. On the contrary, fast-wind turbulence has a\nmore isotropic spectrum at the source and becomes radially symmetric at 1 AU.\nSuch structure is hidden by the symmetrization applied to the data that instead\nreturns a slab geometry.\n", "  We present VLBI observations, carried out with the European Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry Network (EVN), of SDSSJ143244.91+301435.3, a radio-loud\nnarrow-line Seyfert 1 (RLNLS1) characterized by a steep radio spectrum. The\nsource, compact at Very Large Array (VLA) resolution, is resolved on the\nmilliarcsec scale, showing a central region plus two extended structures. The\nrelatively high brightness temperature of all components (5x10^6-1.3x10^8 K)\nsupports the hypothesis that the radio emission is non-thermal and likely\nproduced by a relativistic jet and/or small radio lobes. The observed radio\nmorphology, the lack of a significant core and the presence of a low frequency\n(230 MHz) spectral turnover are reminiscent of the Compact Steep Spectrum\nsources (CSS). However, the linear size of the source (~0.5kpc) measured from\nthe EVN map is lower than the value predicted using the turnover/size relation\nvalid for CSS sources (~6kpc). This discrepancy can be explained by an\nadditional component not detected in our observations, accounting for about a\nquarter of the total source flux density, combined to projection effects. The\nlow core-dominance of the source (CD<0.29) confirms that\nSDSSJ143244.91+301435.3 is not a blazar, i.e. the relativistic jet is not\npointing towards the observer. This supports the idea that\nSDSSJ143244.91+301435.3 may belong to the \"parent population\" of flat-spectrum\nRLNLS1 and favours the hypothesis of a direct link between RLNLS1 and compact,\npossibly young, radio galaxies.\n", "  We present a consistent total flux catalogue for a $\\sim$1 deg$^2$ subset of\nthe COSMOS region (R.A. $\\in [149.55\\degr, 150.65\\degr]$, DEC $\\in [1.80\\degr,\n2.73\\degr]$) with near-complete coverage in 38 bands from the far-ultraviolet\nto the far-infrared. We produce aperture matched photometry for 128,304 objects\nwith i < 24.5 in a manner that is equivalent to the Wright et al. (2016)\ncatalogue from the low-redshift (z < 0.4) Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)\nsurvey. This catalogue is based on publicly available imaging from GALEX, CFHT,\nSubaru, VISTA, Spitzer and Herschel, contains a robust total flux measurement\nor upper limit for every object in every waveband and complements our\nre-reduction of publicly available spectra in the same region. We perform a\nnumber of consistency checks, demonstrating that our catalogue is comparable to\nexisting data sets, including the recent COSMOS2015 catalogue (Laigle et al.\n2016). We also release an updated Davies et al. (2015) spectroscopic catalogue\nthat folds in new spectroscopic and photometric redshift data sets. The\ncatalogues are available for download at\nhttp://cutout.icrar.org/G10/dataRelease.php. Our analysis is optimised for both\npanchromatic analysis over the full wavelength range and for direct comparison\nto GAMA, thus permitting measurements of galaxy evolution for 0 < z < 1 while\nminimising the systematic error resulting from disparate data reduction\nmethods.\n", "  MoS2 atomic layers have recently attracted much interest because of their\ntwo-dimensional structure as well as tunable optical, electrical, and\nmechanical properties for next generation electronic and electro-optical\ndevices. Here we have achieved facile fabrication of MoS2 thin films on CdS\nnanowires by cation exchange in solution at room temperature and importantly\nobserved their extraordinary magnetic properties. We establish the atomic\nstructure of the MoS2/CdS heterostructure by taking atomic images of the\nMoS2/CdS interface as well as performing first-principles density functional\ngeometry optimizations and STEM-ADF image simulations. Furthermore, our first\nprinciples density functional calculations for the MoS2/CdS heterostructure\nreveal that the magnetism in the MoS2/CdS heterostructure stems from the\nferromagnetic MoS2 monolayer next to the MoS2/CdS interface. The ferromagnetism\nis attributed to the partial occupation of the Mo dx2-y2/dxy conduction band in\nthe interfacial MoS2 monolayer caused by the mixed covalent-ionic bonding among\nthe MoS2 and CdS monolayers near the MoS2/CdS interface. The present findings\nof the ferromagnetic MoS2 monolayer with large spin polarization at the\nMoS2-semiconductor interface suggest a new route for fabrication of the\ntransition metal dichalcogenide-based magnetic semiconductor multilayers for\napplications in spintronic devices.\n", "  We present the exact analytical solution of the explicitly time-periodic\nquantum Langevin equation describing the dual-beam backaction-evasion\nmeasurement of a single mechanical oscillator quadrature due to Braginsky,\nVorontsov and Thorne beyond the commonly used rotating-wave approximation. We\nshow that counterrotating terms lead to extra sidebands in the optical and\nmechanical spectra and to a modification of the main peak. Physically, the\nbackaction of the measurement is due to periodic coupling of the mechanical\nresonator to a light field quadrature that only contains cavity-filtered shot\nnoise. Since this fact is independent of other degrees of freedom the resonator\nmight be coupled to, our solution can be generalized, including to\ndissipatively or parametrically squeezed oscillators, as well as recent\ntwo-mode backaction evasion measurements.\n", "  CO$_2$ ice is an important reservoir of carbon and oxygen in star and planet\nforming regions. Together with water and CO, CO$_2$ sets the physical and\nchemical characteristics of interstellar icy grain mantles, including\ndesorption and diffusion energies for other ice constituents. A detailed\nunderstanding of CO$_2$ ice spectroscopy is a prerequisite to characterize\nCO$_2$ interactions with other volatiles both in interstellar ices and in\nlaboratory experiments of interstellar ice analogs. We report laboratory\nspectra of the CO$_2$ longitudinal optical (LO) phonon mode in pure CO$_2$ ice\nand in CO$_2$ ice mixtures with H$_2$O, CO, O$_2$ components. We show that the\nLO phonon mode position is sensitive to the mixing ratio of various ice\ncomponents of astronomical interest. In the era of JWST, this characteristic\ncould be used to constrain interstellar ice compositions and morphologies. More\nimmediately, LO phonon mode spectroscopy provides a sensitive probe of ice\nmixing in the laboratory and should thus enable diffusion measurements with\nhigher precision than has been previously possible.\n", "  The doping efficiency of lithium deposited at cryogenic temperatures on\nepitaxial and CVD monolayer graphene has been investigated under ultra-high\nvacuum conditions. Change of charge carrier density was monitored by gate\nvoltage shift of the Dirac point and by Hall measurements, in low and high\ndoping regimes. It was found that pre-annealing the graphene greatly enhanced\nthe maximum levels of doping that could be achieved: doping saturated at\n$\\Delta n = 2\\times 10^{13}$ e$^-$/cm$^2$ without annealing, independent of\nsample type or previous processing; after a 900 K anneal, the saturated doping\nrose one order of magnitude to $\\Delta n = 2\\times 10^{14}$ e$^-$/cm$^2$.\n", "  We have conducted a near-infrared monitoring campaign at the UK InfraRed\nTelescope (UKIRT), of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 (Triangulum). On the\nbasis of their variability, we have identified stars in the very final stage of\ntheir evolution, and for which the luminosity is more directly related to the\nbirth mass than the more numerous less-evolved giant stars that continue to\nincrease in luminosity. In this fifth paper of the series, we construct the\nbirth mass function and hence derive the star formation history across the\ngalactic disc of M33. The star formation rate has varied between\n$\\sim0.010\\pm0.001$ ($\\sim0.012\\pm0.007$) and 0.060$\\pm0.005$\n(0.052$\\pm0.009$)M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ statistically (systematically)\nin the central square kiloparsec of M33, comparable with the values derived\npreviously with another camera. The total star formation rate in M33 within a\ngalactocentric radius of 14 kpc has varied between $\\sim0.110\\pm0.005$\n($\\sim0.174\\pm0.060$) and $\\sim0.560\\pm0.028$ ($\\sim0.503\\pm0.100$) M$_\\odot$\nyr$^{-1}$ statistically (systematically). We find evidence of two epochs during\nwhich the star formation rate was enhanced by a factor of a few -- one that\nstarted $\\sim6$ Gyr ago and lasted $\\sim3$ Gyr and produced $\\geq71$% of the\ntotal mass in stars, and one $\\sim250$ Myr ago that lasted $\\sim200$ Myr and\nformed $\\leq13$% of the mass in stars. Radial star formation history profiles\nsuggest that the inner disc of M33 was formed in an inside-out formation\nscenario. The outskirts of the disc are dominated by the old population, which\nmay be the result of dynamical effects over many Gyr. We find correspondence to\nspiral structure for all stars, but enhanced only for stars younger than\n$\\sim100$ Myr; this suggests that the spiral arms are transient features and\nnot part of a global density wave potential.\n", "  In this paper, we present GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog (GSWLC), a catalog\nof physical properties (stellar masses, dust attenuations and star formation\nrates (SFRs)) of ~700,000 galaxies with SDSS redshifts below 0.3. GSWLC\ncontains galaxies within the GALEX footprint, regardless of a UV detection,\ncovering 90% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical SED\nfitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al. (2007), with\nimprovements such as blending corrections for low-resolution UV photometry,\nflexible dust attenuation laws, and emission line corrections. GSWLC includes\nmid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based upon 22 micron WISE observations.\nThese estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate\npossible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs\n(SSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of\nSFRs. SSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the\nmid-IR SSFRs, and to SSFRs from three published catalogs. For \"main sequence\"\ngalaxies with no AGN contribution all SSFRs are in very good agreement (within\n0.1 dex on average). In particular, the widely-used aperture-corrected SFRs\nfrom MPA/JHU catalog show no systematic offsets, in contrast to some\nintegral-field spectroscopy results. For galaxies below the main sequence (log\nSSFR<-11), mid-IR (S)SFRs based on fixed luminosity-SFR conversion are severely\nbiased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars.\nFurthermore, mid-IR (S)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies\nwith AGN, presumably due to non-stellar dust heating. UV/optical (S)SFRs are\nthus preferred to IR-based (S)SFRs for quenched galaxies and those which host\nAGN.\n", "  We demonstrate an experimental method for measuring quantum state\ndegeneracies in bound state energy spectra. The technique is based on the\ngeneral principle of detailed balance, and the ability to perform precise and\nefficient measurements of energy-dependent tunnelling-in and -out rates from a\nreservoir. The method is realized using a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot allowing for\nthe detection of time-resolved single-electron tunnelling with a precision\nenhanced by a feedback-control. It is thoroughly tested by tuning orbital and\nspin-degeneracies with electric and magnetic fields. The technique also lends\nitself for studying the connection between the ground state degeneracy and the\nlifetime of the excited states.\n", "  The leptonic decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\\pi$ is calculated from lattice-QCD\nsimulations using $N_f=2+1$ dynamical fermion flavors in the clover-improved\nformulation and 2-HEX smearing. The simulations were performed for a range of\nmass-degenerate light quarks including the physical point and at various\nlattice couplings and volumes, allowing to quantify all relevant sources of\nsystematic uncertainties for our final number of the decay-constant ratio.\nUtilizing input from chiral perturbation theory, we also quote the charged\ndecay-constant ratio $f_{K^\\pm}/f_{\\pi^\\pm}$. With further input from\nsuper-allowed nuclear $\\beta$-decays, eventually we obtain an estimate for the\nCKM-matrix element $V_{\\rm us}$.\n", "  Roughly 1000 white dwarfs are known to be polluted with planetary material,\nand the progenitors of this material are typically assumed to be asteroids. The\ndynamical architectures which perturb asteroids into white dwarfs are still\nunknown, but may be crucially dependent on moons liberated from parent planets\nduring post-main-sequence gravitational scattering. Here, we trace the fate of\nthese exomoons, and show that they more easily achieve deep radial incursions\ntowards the white dwarf than do scattered planets. Consequently, moons are\nlikely to play a significant role in white dwarf pollution, and in some cases\nmay be the progenitors of the pollution itself.\n", "  Aims. The structural inhomogeneities and kinematics of massive star nebulae\nare tracers of their mass-loss history. We conduct a three-dimensional\nmorpho-kinematic analysis of the ejecta of eta Car outside its famous\nHomunculus nebula. Methods. We carried out the first large-scale integral field\nunit observations of eta Car in the optical, covering a field of view of 1'x1'\ncentered on the star. Observations with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer\n(MUSE) at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) reveal the detailed three-dimensional\nstructure of eta Car's outer ejecta. Morpho-kinematic modeling of these ejecta\nis conducted with the code SHAPE. Results. The largest coherent structure in\neta Car's outer ejecta can be described as a bent cylinder with roughly the\nsame symmetry axis as the Homunculus nebula. This large outer shell is\ninteracting with the surrounding medium, creating soft X-ray emission. We\nestablish the shape and extent of the ghost shell in front of the southern\nHomunculus lobe and confirm that the NN condensation can best be modeled as a\nbowshock in the orbital/equatorial plane. Conclusions. The SHAPE modeling of\nthe MUSE observations indicates that the kinematics of the outer ejecta\nmeasured with MUSE can be described by a spatially coherent structure, and this\nstructure also correlates with the extended soft X-ray emission associated with\nthe outer debris field. The ghost shell just outside the southern Homunculus\nlobe hints at a sequence of eruptions within the time frame of the Great\nEruption from 1837-1858 or possibly a later shock/reverse shock velocity\nseparation. Our 3D morpho-kinematic modeling and the MUSE observations\nconstitute an invaluable dataset to be confronted with future\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Such a comparison may shed light on the\nyet elusive physical mechanism responsible for eta Car-like eruptions.\n", "  The electromagnetic properties of an extremely thin metallic checkerboard\ndrastically change from resonant reflection (transmission) to resonant\ntransmission (reflection) when the local electrical conductivity at the\ninterconnection points of the checkerboard is switched. To date, such critical\ntransitions of metasurfaces have been applied only when they have 4-fold\nrotational symmetry, and their application to polarization control, which\nrequires anisotropy, has been unexplored. To overcome this applicability\nlimitation and open up new pathways for dynamic deep-subwavelength polarization\ncontrol by utilizing critical transitions of checkerboard-like metasurfaces, we\nintroduce a universal class of anisotropic Babinet-invertible metasurfaces\nenabling transmission-reflection switching for each orthogonally polarized\nwave. As an application of anisotropic Babinet-invertible metasurfaces, we\nexperimentally realize a reconfigurable terahertz polarizer whose transmitting\naxis can be dynamically rotated by $90^\\circ$.\n", "  One crucial piece of information to study the origin of multiple stellar\npopulations in globular clusters, is the range of initial helium abundances\n$\\Delta{Y}$ amongst the sub-populations hosted by each cluster. These estimates\nare commonly obtained by measuring the width in colour of the unevolved main\nsequence in an optical colour-magnitude-diagram. The measured colour spread is\nthen compared with predictions from theoretical stellar isochrones with varying\ninitial He abundances, to determine $\\Delta{Y}$. The availability of UV/optical\nmagnitudes thanks to the {\\sl HST UV Legacy Survey of Galactic GCs} project,\nwill allow the homogeneous determination of $\\Delta{Y}$ for a large Galactic\nglobular cluster sample. From a theoretical point of view, accurate UV CMDs can\nefficiently disentangle the various sub-populations, and main sequence colour\ndifferences in the ACS $F606W-(F606W-F814W)$ diagram allow an estimate of\n$\\Delta{Y}$. We demonstrate that from a theoretical perspective the\n($F606W-F814W$) colour is an extremely reliable He-abundance indicator. The\nderivative d$Y$/d($F606W-F814W$), computed at a fixed luminosity along the\nunevolved main sequence, is largely insensitive to the physical assumptions\nmade in stellar model computations, being more sensitive to the choice of the\nbolometric correction scale, and is only slightly dependent on the adopted set\nof stellar models. From a theoretical point of view the ($F606W-F814W$) colour\nwidth of the cluster main sequence is therefore a robust diagnostic of the\n$\\Delta{Y}$ range.\n", "  Magnetic helicity is a conserved quantity of ideal magneto-hydrodynamics\ncharacterized by an inverse turbulent cascade. Accordingly, it is often invoked\nas one of the basic physical quantities driving the generation and structuring\nof magnetic fields in a variety of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. We\nprovide here the first systematic comparison of six existing methods for the\nestimation of the helicity of magnetic fields known in a finite volume. All\nsuch methods are reviewed, benchmarked, and compared with each other, and\nspecifically tested for accuracy and sensitivity to errors. To that purpose, we\nconsider four groups of numerical tests, ranging from solutions of the\nthree-dimensional, force-free equilibrium, to magneto-hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations. Almost all methods are found to produce the same value of magnetic\nhelicity within few percent in all tests. In the more solar-relevant and\nrealistic of the tests employed here, the simulation of an eruptive flux rope,\nthe spread in the computed values obtained by all but one method is only 3%,\nindicating the reliability and mutual consistency of such methods in\nappropriate parameter ranges. However, methods show differences in the\nsensitivity to numerical resolution and to errors in the solenoidal property of\nthe input fields. In addition to finite volume methods, we also briefly discuss\na method that estimates helicity from the field lines' twist, and one that\nexploits the field's value at one boundary and a coronal minimal connectivity\ninstead of a pre-defined three-dimensional magnetic-field solution.\n", "  For several decades it has been known that stellar bars in disc galaxies can\nbe triggered by interactions, or by internal processes such as dynamical\ninstabilities. In this work, we explore the differences between these two\nmechanisms using numerical simulations. We perform two groups of simulations\nbased on isolated galaxies, one group in which a bar develops naturally, and\nanother group in which the bar could not develop in isolation. The rest of the\nsimulations recreate 1:1 coplanar fly-by interactions computed with the impulse\napproximation. The orbits we use for the interactions represent the fly-bys in\ngroups or clusters of different masses accordingly to the velocity of the\nencounter. In the analysis we focus on bars' amplitude, size, pattern speed and\ntheir rotation parameter, ${\\cal R}=R_{CR}/R_{bar}$. The latter is used to\ndefine fast (${\\cal R}<1.4$) and slow rotation (${\\cal R}>1.4$). Compared with\nequivalent isolated galaxies we find that bars affected or triggered by\ninteractions: (i) remain in the slow regime for longer; (ii) are more boxy in\nface-on views; (iii) they host kinematically hotter discs. Within this set of\nsimulations we do not see strong differences between retrograde or prograde\nfly-bys. We also show that slow interactions can trigger bar formation.\n", "  Aiming at deriving a statistically well-justified Galactic Center distance,\n$R_0$, and reducing any occurrence of publication bias, we compiled the most\ncomprehensive and most complete database of Galactic Center distances available\nto date, containing 273 new or revised $R_0$ estimates published since records\nbegan in October 1918 until June 2016. We separate our $R_0$ compilation into\ndirect and indirect distance measurements. The latter include a large body of\nestimates that rely on centroid determinations for a range of tracer\npopulations as well as measurements based on kinematic observations of objects\nat the solar circle, combined with a mass and/or rotational model of the Milky\nWay. Careful assessment of the Galactic Center distances resulting from orbital\nmodeling and statistical parallax measurements in the Galactic nucleus yields\nour final Galactic Center distance recommendation of $R_0 = 8.3 \\pm 0.2 \\mbox{\n(statistical)} \\pm 0.4 \\mbox{ (systematic)}$ kpc. The centroid-based distances\nare in good agreement with this recommendation. Neither the direct measurements\nnor the post-1990 centroid-based distance determinations suggest that\npublication bias may be important. The kinematics-based distance estimates are\naffected by significantly larger uncertainties, but they can be used to\nconstrain the Galaxy's rotation velocity at the solar Galactocentric distance,\n$\\Theta_0$. Our results imply that the International Astronomical\nUnion-recommended Galactic Center distance ($R_0^{\\rm IAU} = 8.5$ kpc) needs a\ndownward adjustment, while its $\\Theta_0$ recommendation ($\\Theta_0 = 220$ km\ns$^{-1}$) requires a substantial upward revision.\n", "  We present near-infrared spectra of ten planetary nebulae (PNe) in the Large\nand Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), acquired with the FIRE and GNIRS\nspectrometers on the 6.5-m Baade and 8.1-m Gemini South Telescopes,\nrespectively. We detect Se and/or Kr emission lines in eight of these objects,\nthe first detections of n-capture elements in Magellanic Cloud PNe. Our\nabundance analysis shows large s-process enrichments of Kr (0.6-1.3 dex) in the\nsix PNe in which it was detected, and Se is enriched by 0.5-0.9 dex in five\nobjects. We also estimate upper limits to Rb and Cd abundances in these\nobjects. Our abundance results for the LMC are consistent with the hypothesis\nthat PNe with 2--3 M$_{\\odot}$ progenitors dominate the bright end of the PN\nluminosity function in young gas-rich galaxies. We find no significant\ncorrelations between s-process enrichments and other elemental abundances,\ncentral star temperature, or progenitor mass, though this is likely due to our\nsmall sample size. We determine S abundances from our spectra and find that\n[S/H] agrees with [Ar/H] to within 0.2 dex for most objects, but is lower than\n[O/H] by 0.2-0.4 dex in some PNe, possibly due to O enrichment via third\ndredge-up. Our results demonstrate that n-capture elements can be detected in\nPNe belonging to nearby galaxies with ground-based telescopes, allowing\ns-process enrichments to be studied in PN populations with well-determined\ndistances.\n", "  We present results from a deep sub-millimeter survey in the Serpens Main and\nSerpens/G3-G6 clusters, conducted with the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer\nArray (SCUBA-2) at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. We have combined Herschel\nPACS far-infrared photometry, sub-millimeter continuum and molecular gas line\nobservations, with the aim to conduct a detailed multi-wavelength\ncharacterization of `proto-brown dwarf' candidates in Serpens. We have\nperformed continuum and line radiative transfer modeling, and have considered\nvarious classification schemes to understand the structure and the evolutionary\nstage of the system. We have identified four proto-brown dwarf candidates, of\nwhich the lowest luminosity source has an Lbol ~0.05 Lsun. Two of these\ncandidates show characteristics consistent with Stage 0/I systems, while the\nother two are Stage I-T/Class Flat systems with tenuous envelopes. Our work has\nalso revealed a ~20% fraction of mis-identified Class 0/I/Flat sources that\nshow characteristics consistent with Class II edge-on disk systems. We have set\nconstraints on the mass of the central object using the measured bolometric\nluminosities and numerical simulations of stellar evolution. Considering the\navailable gas+dust mass reservoir and the current mass of the central source,\nthree of these candidates are likely to evolve into brown dwarfs.\n", "  We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to search for a\nnumber of centimetre wavelength methanol transitions which are predicted to\nshow weak maser emission towards star formation regions. Sensitive, high\nspatial and spectral resolution observations towards four high-mass star\nformation regions which show emission in a large number of class II methanol\nmaser transitions did not result in any detections. From these observations we\nare able to place an upper limit of <~1300K on the brightness temperature of\nany emission from the $3_1$A$^+$-$3_1$A$^-$, $17_{-2}$-$18_{-3}$E ($v_t=1$),\n$12_4$-$13_3$A$^-$, $12_4$-$13_3$A$^+$ and $4_1$A$^+$-$4_1$A$^-$ transitions of\nmethanol in these sources on angular scales of 2 arcseconds. This upper limit\nis consistent with current models for class II methanol masers in high-mass\nstar formation regions and better constraints than those provided here will\nlikely require observations with next-generation radio telescopes.\n", "  Supernova 1978K is one of the oldest-known examples of the class of Type IIn\nsupernovae that show evidence for strong interaction between the blast wave and\na dense, pre-existing circumstellar medium. Here we report detections of SN\n1978K at both 34 GHz and 94 GHz, making it only the third extragalactic\nsupernova (after SN 1987A and SN 1996cr) to be detected at late-times at these\nfrequencies. We find SN 1978K to be >400 times more luminous than SN 1987A at\nmillimetre wavelengths in spite of the roughly nine year difference in ages,\nhighlighting the risk in adopting SN 1987A as a template for the evolution of\ncore-collapse supernovae in general. Additionally, from new VLBI observations\nat 8.4 GHz, we measure a deconvolved diameter for SN 1978K of ~5 milli-arcsec,\nand a corresponding average expansion velocity of <1500 km/s. These\nobservations provide independent evidence of an extremely dense circumstellar\nmedium surrounding the progenitor star.\n", "  We study the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GC),\nunder the hypothesis that stars in the second generation formed from the winds\nof intermediate-mass stars, ejected during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nphase, possibly diluted with pristine gas, sharing the same chemical\ncomposition of first-generation stars. To this aim, we use the recent APOGEE\ndata, which provide the surface chemistry of a large sample of giant stars,\nbelonging to clusters that span a wide metallicity range. The APOGEE data set\nis particularly suitable to discriminate among the various pollution scenarios\nproposed so far, as it provides the surface abundances of Mg and Al, the two\nelements involved in a nuclear channel extremely sensitive to the temperature,\nhence to the metallicity of the polluters. The present analysis shows a\nremarkable agreement between the observations and the theoretical yields from\nmassive AGB stars. In particular, the observed extension of the depletion of Mg\nand O and the increase in Al is well reproduced by the models and the trend\nwith the metallicity is also fully accounted for. This study further supports\nthe idea that AGB stars were the key players in the pollution of the\nintra-cluster medium, from which additional generations of stars formed in GC.\n", "  Despite the ability of the cosmological concordance model ($\\Lambda$CDM) to\ndescribe the cosmological observations exceedingly well, power law expansion of\nthe Universe scale radius, $R(t)\\propto t^n$, has been proposed as an\nalternative framework. We examine here these models, analyzing their ability to\nfit cosmological data using robust model comparison criteria. Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNIa), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and acoustic scale\ninformation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been used. We find\nthat SNIa data either alone or combined with BAO can be well reproduced by both\n$\\Lambda$CDM and power law expansion models with $n\\sim 1.5$, while the\nconstant expansion rate model $(n=1)$ is clearly disfavored. Allowing for some\nredshift evolution in the SNIa luminosity essentially removes any clear\npreference for a specific model. The CMB data are well known to provide the\nmost stringent constraints on standard cosmological models, in particular,\nthrough the position of the first peak of the temperature angular power\nspectrum, corresponding to the sound horizon at recombination, a scale\nphysically related to the BAO scale. Models with $n\\geq 1$ lead to a divergence\nof the sound horizon and do not naturally provide the relevant scales for the\nBAO and the CMB. We retain an empirical footing to overcome this issue: we let\nthe data choose the preferred values for these scales, while we recompute the\nionization history in power law models, to obtain the distance to the CMB. In\ndoing so, we find that the scale coming from the BAO data is not consistent\nwith the observed position of the first peak of the CMB temperature angular\npower spectrum for any power law cosmology. Therefore, we conclude that when\nthe three standard probes are combined, the $\\Lambda$CDM model is very strongly\nfavored over any of these alternative models, which are then essentially ruled\nout.\n", "  Since the early 1980s, decimetric spike bursts have been attributed to\nelectron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) by the electrons that produce hard\nX-ray bursts as they precipitate into the chromosphere in the impulsive phase\nof a solar flare. Spike bursts are regarded as analogous to the auroral\nkilometric radiation (AKR), which is associated with the precipitation of\nauroral electrons in a geomagnetic substorm. Originally, a loss-cone-driven\nversion of ECME, developed for AKR, was applied to spike bursts, but it is now\nwidely accepted that a different, horseshoe-driven, version of EMCE applies to\nAKR. We explore the implications of the assumption that horseshoe-driven ECME\nalso applies to spike bursts. We develop a 1D model for the acceleration of the\nelectrons by a parallel electric field, and show that under plausible\nassumptions it leads to a horseshoe distribution of electrons in a solar flare.\nA second requirement for horseshoe-driven ECME is an extremely low plasma\ndensity, referred to as a density cavity. We argue that a coronal density\ncavity should develop in association with a hard X-ray burst, and that such a\ndensity cavity can overcome a long-standing problem with the escape of ECME\nthrough the second-harmonic absorption layer. Both the horseshoe distribution\nand the associated coronal density cavity are highly localized, and could not\nbe resolved in the statistically large number of local precipitation regions\nneeded to explain a hard X-ray burst. The model highlights the \"number problem\"\nin the supply of the electrons needed to explain a hard X-ray burst.\n", "  The radiative thermal neutron capture cross sections over the range of\nthermal energies from 1 keV to 1 MeV are studied in statistical Hauser-Feshbach\nformalism. The optical model potential is constructed by folding the density\ndependent M3Y nucleon-nucleon interaction with radial matter densities of\ntarget nuclei obtained from relativistic-mean-field (RMF) theory. The standard\nnuclear reaction code TALYS1.8 is used for calculation of cross sections. The\nnuclei studied in the present work reside near the $Z=28$ proton shell closure\nand are of astrophysical interests taking part in p-, s-, and r-process of\nnucleosynthesis. The Maxwellian-averaged cross-section (MACS) values for\nenergies important for astrophysical applications are presented.\n", "  To describe of dynamics of ternary fission of $^{252}$Cf an equation of\nmotion of the tri-nuclear system is calculated. The fission of the\n$^{70}$Ni+$^{50}$Ca+$^{132}$Sn channel was chosen as one of the more probable\nchannels of true ternary fission of $^{252}$Cf. The collinearity of ternary\nfission has been checked by analyzing results of the equation of motion. The\nresults show that if initially all nuclei are placed collinearly (potential\nenergy of this position is the smallest) and the component of the middle\nfragment's initial velocity which is perpendicular to this line, is zero then\nternary fission is collinear, otherwise the non collinear ternary fission takes\nplace.\n", "  High-resolution observations in the region, centered at 4400 \\AA\\ and those\nof the lines HeII 4686, Hbeta and HeI 6678 of the spectrum of the symbiotic\nbinary Z And were performed during its outburst in 2006. The line Hbeta had\nadditional satellite high-velocity emission components situated on either side\nof its central peak. The lines of neutral helium presented two components,\nconsisting of a nebular emission situated close to the reference wavelength and\na highly variable P Cyg absorption. Close to the optical maximum the line HeII\n4686 was weak emission feature, but with the fading of the light it changed\ninto an intensive emission consisting of a central narrow component and a broad\ncomponent with a low intensity. The lines of NIII and CIII were very broadened.\nWe demonstrate that all of these groups of lines with very different profiles\ncan be interpreted in the light of the same model, where a disc-shaped material\nsurrounding the compact object collimates its stellar wind and gives rise to\nbipolar outflow.\n", "  I propose a random network model governed by a Gaussian weight corresponding\nto Ising link antiferromagnetism as a model for emergent quantum space-time. In\nthis model, discrete space is fundamental, not a regularization, its spectral\ndimension $d_s$ is not a model input but is, rather, completely determined by\nthe antiferromagnetic coupling constant. Perturbative terms suppressing\ntriangles and favouring squares lead to locally Euclidean ground states that\nare Ricci flat \"large worlds\" with power-law extension. I then consider the\nquenched graphs of lowest energy for $d_s=2$ and $d_s=3$ and I show how\nquenching leads to the spontaneous emergence of embedding spaces of Hausdorff\ndimension $d_H=4$ and $d_H=5$, respectively. One of the additional, spontaneous\ndimensions can be interpreted as time, causality being an emergent property\nthat arises in the large $N$ limit (with $N$ the number of vertices). For\n$d_s=2$, the quenched graphs constitute a discrete version of a\n5D-space-filling surface with a number of fundamental degrees of freedom\nscaling like $N^{2/5}$, a graph version of the holographic principle. These\nholographic degrees of freedom can be identified with the squares of the\nquenched graphs, which, being these triangle-free, are the fundamental area (or\nloop) quanta.\n", "  We examine the correlations of neutron star radii with the nuclear matter\nincompressibility, symmetry energy, and their slopes, which are the key\nparameters of the equation of state (EoS) of asymmetric nuclear matter. The\nneutron star radii and the EoS parameters are evaluated using a representative\nset of 24 Skyrme-type effective forces and 18 relativistic mean field models,\nand two microscopic calculations, all describing 2$M_\\odot$ neutron stars.\nUnified EoSs for the inner-crust-core region have been built for all the\nphenomenological models, both relativistic and non-relativistic. Our\ninvestigation shows the existence of a strong correlation of the neutron star\nradii with the linear combination of the slopes of the nuclear matter\nincompressibility and the symmetry energy coefficients at the saturation\ndensity. Such correlations are found to be almost independent of the neutron\nstar mass in the range $0.6\\text{-}1.8M_{\\odot}$. This correlation can be\nlinked to the empirical relation existing between the star radius and the\npressure at a nucleonic density between one and two times saturation density,\nand the dependence of the pressure on the nuclear matter incompressibility, its\nslope and the symmetry energy slope. The slopes of the nuclear matter\nincompressibility and the symmetry energy coefficients as estimated from the\nfinite nuclei data yield the radius of a $1.4M_{\\odot}$ neutron star in the\nrange $11.09\\text{-}12.86$ km.\n", "  Hybrid stars with a quark phase described by the Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model\nare studied. The hadron-quark model used to determine the stellar matter\nequation of state favors the appearance of quark matter: the coincidence of the\ndeconfinement and chiral transitions and a low vacuum constituent quark mass.\nThese two properties are essential to build equations of state that predict\npure quark matter in the center of neutron stars. The effect of\nvector-isoscalar and vector-isovector terms is discussed, and it is shown that\nthe vector-isoscalar terms are necessary to describe 2$M_\\odot$ hybrid stars,\nand the vector-isovector terms result in larger quark cores and a smaller\ndeconfinement density.\n", "  Synthetic turbulence models are a useful tool that provide realistic\nrepresentations of turbulence, necessary to test theoretical results, to serve\nas background fields in some numerical simulations, and to test analysis tools.\nModels of 1D and 3D synthetic turbulence previously developed still required\nlarge computational resources. A new wavelet-based model of synthetic\nturbulence, able to produce a field with tunable spectral law, intermittency\nand anisotropy, is presented here. The rapid algorithm introduced, based on the\nclassic $p$-model of intermittent turbulence, allows to reach a broad spectral\nrange using a modest computational effort. The model has been tested against\nthe standard diagnostics for intermittent turbulence, i.e. the spectral\nanalysis, the scale-dependent statistics of the field increments, and the\nmultifractal analysis, all showing an excellent response.\n", "  The compositions of nascent planets depend on the compositions of their birth\ndisks. In particular, the elemental compositions of Gas Giant gaseous envelopes\ndepend on the elemental composition of the disk gas from which the envelope is\naccreted. Previous models demonstrated that sequential freeze-out of O and\nC-bearing volatiles in disks will result in an supersolar C/O ratios and\nsubsolar C/H ratios in the gas between water and CO snowlines. This result does\nnot take into account, however, the expected grain growth and radial drift of\npebbles in disks, and the accompanying re-distribution of volatiles from the\nouter to the inner disk. Using a toy model we demonstrate that when drift is\nconsidered, CO is enhanced between the water and CO snowline, resulting in both\nsupersolar C/O and C/H ratios in the disk gas in the Gas Giant formation zone.\nThis result appears robust to the details of the disk model as long as there is\nsubstantial pebble drift across the CO snowline, and the efficiency of CO vapor\ndiffusion is limited. Gas Giants that accrete their gaseous envelopes exterior\nto the water snowline and do not experience substantial core-envelope mixing,\nmay thus present both superstellar C/O and C/H ratios in their atmospheres.\nPebble drift will also affect the nitrogen and noble gas abundances in the\nplanet forming zones, which may explain some of Jupiter's peculiar abundance\npatterns.\n", "  The Breakthrough Starshot Initiative is suggested to develop the concept of\npropelling a nano-scale spacecraft by the radiation pressure of an intense\nlaser beam. If such a nanocraft could be accelerated to 20 percent of light\nspeed, it could reach the vicinity of our nearest potentially habitable\nexoplanet within our life time and capture its images and obtain other\nscientific data. In this project the nanocraft is a gram-scale robotic\nspacecraft comprising two main parts: StarChip and Lightsail.\n  To achieve the goal of the project it is necessary to solve a number of\noutstanding scientific problems. One of these tasks is to make sure that the\nnanocraft position and orientation inside the intense laser beam column is\nstable. The nanocraft driven by intense laser beam pressure acting on its\nLightsail is sensitive to the torques and lateral forces reacting on the\nsurface of the sail. These forces influence the orientation and lateral\ndisplacement of the spacecraft, thus affecting its dynamics. If unstable the\nnanocraft might be expelled from the area of laser beam. In choosing the models\nfor nanocraft stability studies we are using several assumptions: 1.\nconfiguration of nanocraft is treated as rigid body (applicability of Euler\nequations); 2. flat or concave shape of circular sail; 3. mirror reflection of\nlaser beam from surface of the Lightsail. We found conditions of position\nstability for spherical and conical shape of the sail. The simplest stable\nconfigurations require the StarChip to be removed from the sail to make the\ndistance to the center of mass of nanocraft bigger than curvature radius of the\nsail. Stability criteria do not require the spinning of the nanocraft. A flat\nsail is never stable (even with spinning).\n", "  From the perspective that the $\\Lambda_c(2595)$ and $\\Lambda_c(2625)$ are\ndynamically generated resonances from the $DN,~D^*N$ interaction and coupled\nchannels, we have evaluated the rates for $\\Lambda_b \\to \\pi^- \\Lambda_c(2595)$\nand $\\Lambda_b \\to \\pi^- \\Lambda_c(2625)$ up to a global unknown factor that\nallows us to calculate the ratio of rates and compare with experiment, where\ngood agreement is found. Similarly, we can also make predictions for the ratio\nof rates of the, yet unknown, decays of $\\Lambda_b \\to D_s^- \\Lambda_c(2595)$\nand $\\Lambda_b \\to D_s^- \\Lambda_c(2625)$ and make estimates for their\nindividual branching fractions.\n", "  Using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the low-frequency Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA1 LOW) precursor located in Western Australia, we have completed the\nGaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and present the\nresulting extragalactic catalogue, utilising the first year of observations.\nThe catalogue covers 24,831 square degrees, over declinations south of\n$+30^\\circ$ and Galactic latitudes outside $10^\\circ$ of the Galactic plane,\nexcluding some areas such as the Magellanic Clouds. It contains 307,455 radio\nsources with 20 separate flux density measurements across 72--231MHz, selected\nfrom a time- and frequency- integrated image centred at 200MHz, with a\nresolution of $\\approx 2$'. Over the catalogued region, we estimate that the\ncatalogue is 90% complete at 170mJy, and 50% complete at 55mJy, and large areas\nare complete at even lower flux density levels. Its reliability is 99.97% above\nthe detection threshold of $5\\sigma$, which itself is typically 50mJy. These\nobservations constitute the widest fractional bandwidth and largest sky area\nsurvey at radio frequencies to date, and calibrate the low frequency flux\ndensity scale of the southern sky to better than 10%. This paper presents\ndetails of the flagging, imaging, mosaicking, and source\nextraction/characterisation, as well as estimates of the completeness and\nreliability. All source measurements and images are available online\n(http://www.mwatelescope.org/science/gleam-survey). This is the first in a\nseries of publications describing the GLEAM survey results.\n", "  In canonical gravity, covariance is implemented by brackets of\nhypersurface-deformation generators forming a Lie algebroid. Lie algebroid\nmorphisms therefore allow one to relate different versions of the brackets that\ncorrespond to the same space-time structure. An application to examples of\nmodified brackets found mainly in models of loop quantum gravity can in some\ncases map the space-time structure back to the classical Riemannian form after\na field redefinition. For one type of quantum corrections (holonomies),\nsignature change appears to be a generic feature of effective space-time, and\nis shown here to be a new quantum space-time phenomenon which cannot be mapped\nto an equivalent classical structure. In low-curvature regimes, our\nconstructions prove the existence of classical space-time structures assumed\nelsewhere in models of loop quantum cosmology, but also shows the existence of\nadditional quantum corrections that have not always been included.\n", "  Light-cone QCD sum rules to leading order in QCD are used to investigate the\ntensor form factors of the $\\Sigma-\\Sigma$, $\\Xi-\\Xi$ and $ \\Sigma-\\Lambda$\ntransitions in the range $1 GeV^2 \\leq Q^2 \\leq 10 GeV^2$. The DAs of $\\Sigma$,\n$\\Xi$ and $\\Lambda$ baryon have been calculated without higher order terms.\nThen, study including higher order corrections have been done for $\\Sigma$ and\n$\\Lambda$ baryon. The result of form factors are obtained using these two DAs.\nWe make a comparison with the predictions of the chiral quark soliton model.\n", "  We present a calculation of the lattice thermal conductivity of Si-Ge\nnanowires (NWs), based on solving the Boltzmann transport equation by the Monte\nCarlo method of sampling the phonon mean free paths. We augment the previous\nwork with the full phonon dispersion and a partially diffuse momentum-dependent\nspecularity model for boundary roughness scattering. We find that phonon\nflights are comprised of a mix of long free-flights over several {\\mu}m\ninterrupted by bursts of short flights, resulting in a heavy tailed\ndistribution of flight lengths, typically encountered in L\\'{e}vy walk\ndynamics. Consequently, phonon transport in Si-Ge NWs is neither entirely\nballistic nor diffusive; instead, it falls into an intermediate regime called\nsuperdiffusion where thermal conductivity scales with the length of the NW as\n$\\kappa \\propto L^{\\alpha}$ with the exponent of length dependence\n$\\alpha\\approx 0.33$ over a broad range of wire lengths 10 nm$<L<$10 $\\mu$m\nregardless of diameter and roughness. We conclude that thermal conductivity in\nSi-Ge alloy NWs is length-dependent up to 10 $\\mu$m and therefore can be tuned\nfor thermoelectric applications.\n", "  In this paper we investigated the long-term evolution of the pulse-period in\nthe high-mass X-ray binary LMC X-4 by taking advantage of more than 43~yrs of\nmeasurements in the X-ray domain. Our analysis revealed for the first time that\nthe source is displaying near-periodical variations of its spin period on a\ntime scale of roughly 6.8~yrs, making LMC X-4 one of the known binary systems\nshowing remarkable long term spin torque reversals. We discuss different\nscenarios to interpret the origin of these torque reversals.\n", "  Robin (or mixed) boundary conditions in quantum mechanics have received\nconsiderable attention in the last two decades, in particular, for applications\nto nanoscale systems. However, their utility has remained obscure to the larger\nphysics community; in fact, one may find extant claims in the literature about\nthe supposed naturalness of the specific Dirichlet (or vanishing) boundary\ncondition. Here we demonstrate that not only are Dirichlet boundary conditions\nunnatural, but that Robin boundary conditions have utility in the\nlong-wavelength approximation of short-ranged potentials. For illustration, we\nconsider a non-relativistic particle in one dimension under the influence of\nthe multi-step and Morse potential. We derive the scattering and bound states\nfor these potentials and determine the parameters that describe those states in\nan effective system, namely one in which there is a free particle with a\nboundary. This method appears to be generically applicable and also\ngeneralizable to many other real systems.\n", "  The thermal dynamics of the two-dimensional Ising model and quantum dynamics\nof the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) are mapped to one\nanother through the transfer-matrix formalism. We show that the fermionised\nTFIM undergoes a Fermi-surface topology-changing Lifshitz transition at its\ncritical point. We identify the degree of freedom which tracks the Lifshitz\ntransition via changes in topological quantum numbers (e.g., Chern number,\nBerry phase etc.). An emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry at criticality is observed to\nlead to a topological quantum number different from that which characterises\nthe ordered phase. The topological transition is also understood via a spectral\nflow thought-experiment in a Thouless charge pump, revealing the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence across the transition. The duality property of the phases and\ntheir entanglement content are studied, revealing a holographic relation with\nthe entanglement at criticality. The effects of a non-zero longitudinal field\nand interactions that scatter across the singular Fermi surface are treated\nwithin the renormalisation group (RG) formalism. The analysis reveals that the\ncritical point of the 1D TFIM and the 1D spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain are\nconnected via a line of $SU(2)$-symmetric theories. We extend our analysis to\nshow that the classical to quantum correspondence links the critical theories\nof Ising models in various dimensions holographically through the universal\neffective Hamiltonian that describes the Lifshitz transition of the 1D TFIM. We\nobtain in this way a unified perspective of transitions in Ising models that\nlie beyond the traditional Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm. We discuss the\nconsequences of our results for similar topological transitions observed in\nclassical spin models, topological insulators, superconductors and lattice\ngauge-field theories which are related to the Ising universality class.\n", "  Ground-based gamma ray observations of the Galactic Center region have\nrevealed a high energy gamma ray source spatially coincident with the\ngravitational centroid of our Galaxy. The pointlike emission detected by\nH.E.S.S. exhibits an energy cut-off at about 10 TeV. We identify the parameters\nof the best fit of the exponential and the super-exponential cutoff models to\nthe spectrum of the pointlike source and find that super-exponential one\nprovides a similar quality of the fit to the spectrum of the pointlike source\nas the best-fit exponential cutoff model, while a dark matter interpretation\ndoes not provide as good a fit in the whole energy range of the signal. Based\non the magnitude of the flux we derive constraints in the plane of the slope of\nthe density profile $\\gamma$ and the critical radius, below which the density\nis assumed to be constant, $r_c$. Motivated by recent results on the spectrum\nand morphology from H.E.S.S. and by the possible observation of a\nsuper-exponential cutoff, we forecast the observations of super-exponential\nversus exponential cut-offs by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). We\nderive a formula for $J$-factor in the small angle approximation and propose\napproximate morphological constraints on the central source.\n", "  The formation and evolution of X-ray sources in globular clusters is likely\nto be affected by the cluster internal dynamics and the stellar interactions in\nthe cluster dense environment.Several observational studies have revealed a\ncorrelation between the number of X-ray sources and the stellar encounter rate\nand provided evidence of the role of dynamics in the formation of X-ray\nbinaries. We have performed a survey of Monte-Carlo simulations aimed at\nexploring the connection between the dynamics and formation of cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs) and the origin of the observed correlation between the number\nof these objects, $N_{\\rm cv}$, and the stellar encounter rate, $\\Gamma$.The\nresults of our simulations show a correlation between $N_{\\rm cv}$ and $\\Gamma$\nas found in observational data, illustrate the essential role played by\ndynamics, and shed light on the dynamical history behind this correlation. CVs\nin our simulations are more centrally concentrated than single stars with\nmasses close to those of turn-off stars, although this trend is stronger for\nCVs formed from primordial binaries undergoing exchange encounters, which\ninclude a population of more massive CVs absent in the group of CVs formed from\nbinaries not suffering any component exchange.\n", "  Analyzing simulated extensive air shower (EAS) events generated with the\nMonte Carlo code CORSIKA, this paper critically studies the characteristics of\nlateral distribution of electrons in EAS around the knee energy region of the\nenergy spectrum of primary cosmic rays. The study takes into account the issue\nof lateral shower age parameter as indicator of the stage of development of\nshowers in the atmosphere. The correlation of lateral shower age parameter with\nother EAS observables is examined, using simulated data in the context of its\npossible use in a multi-parameter study of EAS, with a view to obtaining\ninformation about the nature of the shower initiating primaries at sea level\nEAS experiments. It is shown that the observed slope of the lateral density\nfunction in the 3-dimensional plot at least for the KASCADE data supports the\nidea of a transition from light to heavy mass composition around the knee.\n", "  We study the atomic structure of twisted bilayer graphene, with very small\nmismatch angles ($\\theta \\sim 0.28^0$), a topic of intense recent interest. We\nuse simulations, in which we combine a recently presented semi-empirical\npotential for single-layer graphene, with a new term for out-of-plane\ndeformations, [Jain et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 119, 2015] and an often-used\ninterlayer potential [Kolmogorov et al., Phys. Rev. B, 71, 2005]. This\ncombination of potentials is computationally cheap but accurate and precise at\nthe same time, allowing us to study very large samples, which is necessary to\nreach very small mismatch angles in periodic samples. By performing large scale\natomistic simulations, we show that the vortices appearing in the Moir\\'e\npattern in the twisted bilayer graphene samples converge to a constant size in\nthe thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the well known sinusoidal behavior of\nenergy no longer persists once the misorientation angle becomes very small\n($\\theta<1^0$). We also show that there is a significant buckling after the\nrelaxation in the samples, with the buckling height proportional to the system\nsize. These structural properties have direct consequences on the electronic\nand optical properties of bilayer graphene.\n", "  In 1970 Zel'dovich published a far-reaching paper presenting a simple\nequation describing the nonlinear growth of primordial density inhomogeneities.\nThe equation was remarkably successful in explaining the large scale structure\nin the Universe that we observe: a Universe in which the structure appears to\nbe delineated by filaments and clusters of galaxies surrounding huge void\nregions. In order to concretise this impression it is necessary to define these\nstructural elements through formal techniques with which we can compare the\nZel'dovich model and N-body simulations with the observational data.\n  We present an overview of recent efforts to identify voids, filaments and\nclusters in both the observed galaxy distribution and in numerical simulations\nof structure formation. We focus, in particular, on methods that involve no\nfine-tuning of parameters and that handle scale dependence automatically. It is\nimportant that these techniques should result in finding structures that relate\ndirectly to the dynamical mechanism of structure formation.\n", "  PuCoGa$_5$ has emerged as a prototypical heavy-fermion superconductor, with\nits transition temperature ($T_c\\simeq18.5$ K) being the highest amongst such\nmaterials. Nonetheless, a clear description as to what drives the\nsuperconducting pairing is still lacking, rendered complicated by the\nnotoriously intricate nature of plutonium's 5$f$ valence electrons. Here, we\npresent a detailed $^{69,71}$Ga nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) study of\nPuCoGa$_5$, concentrating on the system's normal state properties near to $T_c$\nand aiming to detect distinct signatures of possible pairing mechanisms. In\nparticular, the quadrupole frequency and spin-lattice relaxation rate were\nmeasured for the two crystallographically inequivalent Ga sites and for both Ga\nisotopes, in the temperature range 1.6 K - 300 K. No evidence of significant\ncharge fluctuations is found from the NQR observables. On the contrary, the\nlow-energy dynamics is dominated by anisotropic spin fluctuations with strong,\nnearly critical, in-plane character, which are effectively identical to the\ncase of the sister compound PuCoIn$_5$. These findings are discussed within the\ncontext of different theoretical proposals for the unconventional pairing\nmechanism in heavy-fermion superconductors.\n", "  We demonstrate that linear absorption coefficient (LAC) of a graphene-silicon\nhybrid waveguide (GSHW) is determined by the optical transmission spectra of a\ngraphene coated symmetrically coupled add-drop silicon microring resonator\n(SC-ADSMR), of which the value is around 0.23 dB/um. In contrast to the\ntraditional cut-back method, the measured results are not dependent on the\ncoupling efficiency of the fiber tip and the waveguide. Moreover, precision\nevaluation of graphene coated silicon microring resonator (SMR) is crucial for\nthe optoelectronic devices targeting for compact footprint and low power\nconsumption.\n", "  Electrokinetic transport behavior in nanochannels is different to that in\nlarger sized channels. Specifically, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in\nnanochannels have demonstrated two little understood phenomena which are not\nobserved in microchannels, being: (i) the decrease of average electroosmotic\nmobility at high surface charge density, and (ii) the decrease of channel\nconductance at high salt concentrations, as the surface charge is increased.\nHowever, current electric double layer models do not capture these results. In\nthis study we provide evidence that this inconsistency primarily arises from\nthe neglect of the viscoelectric effect (being the increase of local viscosity\nnear charged surfaces due to water molecule orientation) in conventional\ncontinuum models. It is shown that predictions of electroosmotic mobility in a\nslit nanochannel, derived from a viscoelectric-modified continuum model, are in\nquantitative agreement with previous MD simulation results. Furthermore,\nviscoelectric effects are found to dominate over ion steric and dielectric\nsaturation effects in both electroosmotic and ion transport processes. Finally,\nwe indicate that mechanisms of the previous MD-observed phenomena can be\nwell-explained by the viscoelectric theory.\n", "  In a previous paper we have shown that Schr\\\"odinger equation with the\nnon-analytic attractive exponential potential $V(x)= -g^2\\exp (-|x|)$ is\nexactly solvable. It has finitely many discrete eigenstates described by the\nBessel function of the first kind $J_{\\nu}(z)$ and the eigenvalues are\nspecified by the positive zeros of $J_{\\nu}(g)$ and $J'_{\\nu}(g)$ as a function\nof the order $\\nu$ with fixed $g>0$. Now we show the corresponding results for\nthe {\\em confining\\/} non-analytic exponential potential $V(x)= g^2\\exp\n(2|x|)$. This has infinitely many discrete eigenstates described by the\nmodified Bessel function of the second kind $K_{i\\nu}(z)$. The eigenvalues are\nspecified by the {\\em pure imaginary zeros\\/} of $K_{i\\nu}(g)$ and\n$K'_{i\\nu}(g)$ as a function of the order with fixed $g>0$.\n", "  The present paper is devoted to the construction of a catalog of isolated\ngalaxy pairs from the Uppsala Galaxy Catalog (UGC), using accurate radial\nvelocities. The UGC lists 12921 galaxies to declination larger than -2 deg 30\nmin and is complete to an apparent diameter of 1 arcmin. The criteria used to\ndefine the isolated galaxy pairs are the following: 1) Velocity criterion:\nradial velocity difference between the members lower than 500 km/s; 2)\nInterdistance criterion: projected distance between the members smaller than 1\nMpc; 3) Reciprocity criterion: each member is the closest galaxy to the other\none, which excludes multiplets; 4) Isolation information: the catalog lists the\nratio between the projected distance to the closest UGC galaxy (having a\nvelocity difference smaller than 500 km/s) and the pair members interdistance,\nthus allowing one to choose any isolation criterion (beyond the chosen limit\n2.5). In addition, we have accounted for the small diameter bias by searching\nfor CGCG galaxies in the pair environment and used the same isolation\ncriterion. A peculiar investigation has allowed to gather very accurate radial\nvelocities for pair members, from high quality HI and optical measurements\n(median uncertainty on velocity differences 10 km/s). Our final catalog\ncontains 1005 galaxy pairs. Then we give some global properties of the pair\ncatalog. We display the histograms of the radial velocity differences between\nthe pair members and of their projected interdistances (median 0.29 Mpc).\nFinally, we provide an estimate of the contamination by cosmological false\n\"pairs\", which is about 10 percent up to a velocity difference of 380 km/s,\nbeyond which all pairs are probably false.\n", "  We report our discovery in Swift satellite data of a transient gamma-ray\ncounterpart (3.2$\\sigma$ confidence) to the fast radio burst FRB131104, the\nfirst such counterpart to any FRB. The transient has duration $T_{90} \\gtrsim\n100$s and fluence $S_\\gamma\\approx 4\\times 10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, increasing\nthe energy budget for this event by more than a billion times; at the nominal\n$z\\approx 0.55$ redshift implied by its dispersion measure, the burst's\ngamma-ray energy output is $E_\\gamma \\approx 5\\times 10^{51}$ erg. The observed\nradio to gamma-ray fluence ratio for FRB131104 is consistent with a lower limit\nwe derive from Swift observations of another FRB, which is not detected in\ngamma-rays, and with an upper limit previously derived for the brightest\ngamma-ray flare from SGR 1806-20, which was not detected in the radio. X-ray,\nultraviolet, and optical observations beginning two days after the FRB do not\nreveal any associated afterglow, supernova, or transient; Swift observations\nexclude association with the brightest 65% of Swift gamma-ray burst X-ray\nafterglows, while leaving the possibility of an associated supernova at much\nmore than 10% the FRB's nominal distance, $D\\gtrsim 320$ Mpc, largely\nunconstrained. Transient high-luminosity gamma-ray emission arises most\nnaturally in a relativistic outflow or shock breakout, as for example from\nmagnetar flares, gamma-ray bursts, relativistic supernovae, and some types of\ngalactic nuclear activity. Our discovery thus bolsters the case for an\nextragalactic origin for some FRBs and suggests that future rapid-response\nobservations might identify long-lived counterparts, resolving the nature of\nthese mysterious phenomena and realizing their promise as probes of cosmology\nand fundamental physics.\n", "  A decade ago Rhie \\et (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 90}, 247201 (2003)) reported\nthat when ferromagnetic nickel is subject to an intense ultrashort laser pulse,\nits exchange splitting is reduced quickly. But to simulate such reduction\nremains a big challenge. The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both\nthe band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after\nlaser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent\ndensity functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional\ntheory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the\ndensity functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is\nreiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed\nto change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger\ndemagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling\nmethod into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the\nexchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both\nthe majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the\nmajority shifts a lot more. The ultrafast reduction in exchange splitting\noccurs concomitantly with demagnetization. While our current theory is still\nunable to yield the same percentage loss in the spin moment as observed in the\nexperiment, it predicts a correct trend that agrees with the experiments. With\na better functional, we believe that our results can be further improved.\n", "  We examine energy and particle exchange between finite-sized quantum systems\nand find a new form of nonequilibrium states. The exchange rate undergoes\nstepwise evolution in time, and its magnitude and sign dramatically change\naccording to system size differences. The origin lies in interference effects\ncontributed by multiply scattered waves at system boundaries. Although such\ncharacteristics are utterly different from those of true steady state for\ninfinite systems, Onsager's reciprocal relation remains universally valid.\n", "  QCD at finite temperature below the phase transition should be determined in\nterms of colour singlet states such as hadrons and strings. We show how\nquark-hadron duality allows extracting sensible information concerning heavy\nquark and string breaking coupled channel dynamics from Polyakov loop\ncorrelators.\n", "  The RD52 (DREAM) collaboration is performing R\\&D on dual readout calorimetry\ntechniques with the aim of improving hadronic energy resolution for future high\nenergy physics experiments. The simultaneous detection of Cherenkov and\nscintillation light enables us to measure the electromagnetic fraction of\nhadron shower event-by-event. As a result, we could eliminate the main\nfluctuation which prevented from achieving precision energy measurement for\nhadrons.\n  We have tested the performance of the lead and copper fiber prototypes\ncalorimeters with various energies of electromagnetic particles and hadrons.\nDuring the beam test, we investigated the energy resolutions for electrons and\npions as well as the identification of those particles in a longitudinally\nunsegmented calorimeter.\n  Measurements were also performed on pure and doped PbWO$_{4}$ crystals, as\nwell as BGO and BSO, with the aim of realising a crystal based dual readout\ndetector. We will describe our results, focusing on the more promising\nproperties of homogeneous media for the technique. Guidelines for additional\ndevelopments on crystals will be also given.\n  Finally we discuss the construction techniques that we have used to assemble\nour prototypes and give an overview of the ones that could be industrialized\nfor the construction of a full hermetic calorimeter.\n", "  Priming is the ability of the brain to more quickly activate a target concept\nin response to a related stimulus (prime). Experiments point to the existence\nof an overlap between the populations of the neurons coding for different\nstimuli. Other experiments show that prime-target relations arise in the\nprocess of long term memory formation. The classical modelling paradigm is that\nlong term memories correspond to stable steady states of a Hopfield network\nwith Hebbian connectivity. Experiments show that short term synaptic depression\nplays an important role in the processing of memories. This leads naturally to\na computational model of priming, called latching dynamics; a stable state\n(prime) can become unstable and the system may converge to another transiently\nstable steady state (target). Hopfield network models of latching dynamics have\nbeen studied by means of numerical simulation, however the conditions for the\nexistence of this dynamics have not been elucidated. In this work we use a\ncombination of analytic and numerical approaches to confirm that latching\ndynamics can exist in the context of Hebbian learning, however lacks robustness\nand imposes a number of biologically unrealistic restrictions on the model. In\nparticular our work shows that the symmetry of the Hebbian rule is not an\nobstruction to the existence of latching dynamics, however fine tuning of the\nparameters of the model is needed.\n", "  In this work I will obtain the system of nonlinear equations that correctly\ndescribes the motion of motorcycles and fast bicycles (above 30 km/hr) for the\nfirst time in literature. I will use it to calculate the lean angle during a\nturn and prove that the motion of the vehicle is unconditionally stable at all\noperating speeds under consideration. I will then employ it to give a\nquantitative model of counter-steering - the phenomenon by which a turning\nmobike first goes the wrong way and then starts going the right way.\n", "  Very first time Elzaki transform is used in non relativistic quantum\nmechanics to solve $N$-dimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation in a closed form\nfor different solvable potential models. A universal transformation scheme is\nintroduced and a formula based approach is developed which shows how to apply\nElzaki transform to differential equation with non-constant coefficients that\ngenerally appear in solving quantum mechanical initial value problems specially\nfor multidimensional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\n", "  The texturization of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces is achieved at\natmospheric pressure by using the post-discharge of a radio-frequency plasma\ntorch supplied in helium and oxygen gases. The surface properties are\ncharacterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nand atomic force microscopy. We show that the plasma treatment increases the\nsurface hydrophobicity (with water contact angles increasing from 115 to\n155{\\deg}) only by modifying the PTFE surface morphology and not the\nstoichiometry. Measurements of sample mass losses correlated to the ejection of\nCF$_2$ fragments from the PTFE surface evidenced an etching mechanism at\natmospheric pressure.\n", "  While new species and properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials are being\nreported with extraordinary regularity, a significant bottleneck in the field\nis the ability to controllably process material into working devices. We report\na chemical vapor deposition process to selectively grow 2D material in a\ndeterministic manner around lithographically defined bulk metallic patterns\nwhich concurrently provide as-grown contacts to the material. Monolayer films,\nwith lateral extent of up to hundreds of microns are controllably grown on and\naround patterned regions of transition metals. By using different combinations\nof metallic pattern and oxide based precursor, heterostructured MoS2/WS2 growth\nhas been observed as well. The materials display strong luminescence, monolayer\nRaman signatures, and relatively large crystal domains. In addition to\nproducing high optical quality monolayer material deterministically and\nselectively over large regions, the metallic patterns remain conductive and\ntherefore have the advantage of providing as-grown metallic contacts to the\nmaterial, offering a path for simple device fabrication and large scale\nproduction\n", "  A taxonomy is a standardized framework to classify and organize items into\ncategories. Hierarchical taxonomies are ubiquitous, ranging from the\nclassification of organisms to the file system on a computer. Characterizing\nthe typical distribution of items within taxonomic categories is an important\nquestion with applications in many disciplines. Ecologists have long sought to\naccount for the patterns observed in species-abundance distributions (the\nnumber of individuals per species found in some sample), and computer\nscientists study the distribution of files per directory. Is there a universal\nstatistical distribution describing how many items are typically found in each\ncategory in large taxonomies? Here, we analyze a wide array of large,\nreal-world datasets -- including items lost and found on the New York City\ntransit system, library books, and a bacterial microbiome -- and discover such\nan underlying commonality. A simple, non-parametric branching model that\nrandomly categorizes items and takes as input only the total number of items\nand the total number of categories successfully reproduces the abundance\ndistributions in these datasets. This result may shed light on patterns in\nspecies-abundance distributions long observed in ecology. The model also\npredicts the number of taxonomic categories that remain unrepresented in a\nfinite sample.\n", "  Starting from the Dirac equation coupled to a classical radiation field a set\nof equations of motion for charged quasi-particles in the classical limit for\nslowly varying radiation and matter fields is derived. The radiation reaction\nterm derived in the paper is the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac term.\n", "  In this work, a model and simulation method to study the dynamics of pore\nformation and annihilation in a lipid membrane under an applied electric field\nhas been developed. A continuum-level diffusive interface model (phase-field)\nmethod is applied to model the evolution of the pore in a lipid membrane patch.\nThe numerical method and results are presented.\n", "  A stable numerical solution of the steady Stokes problem requires\ncompatibility between the choice of velocity and pressure approximation that\nhas traditionally proven problematic for meshless methods. In this work, we\npresent a discretization that couples a staggered scheme for pressure\napproximation with a divergence-free velocity reconstruction to obtain an\nadaptive, high-order, finite difference-like discretization that can be\nefficiently solved with conventional algebraic multigrid techniques. We use\nanalytic benchmarks to demonstrate equal-order convergence for both velocity\nand pressure when solving problems with curvilinear geometries. In order to\nstudy problems in dense suspensions, we couple the solution for the flow to the\nequations of motion for freely suspended particles in an implicit monolithic\nscheme. The combination of high-order accuracy with fully-implicit schemes\nallows the accurate resolution of stiff lubrication forces directly from the\nsolution of the Stokes problem without the need to introduce sub-grid\nlubrication models.\n", "  We present a sample of 80 candidate strongly lensed galaxies with flux\ndensity above 100mJy at 500{\\mu}m extracted from the Herschel Astrophysical\nTerahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS), over an area of 600 square degrees.\nAvailable imaging and spectroscopic data allow us to confirm the strong lensing\nin 20 cases and to reject it in one case. For other 8 objects the lensing\nscenario is strongly supported by the presence of two sources along the same\nline of sight with distinct photometric redshifts. The remaining objects await\nmore follow-up observations to confirm their nature. The lenses and the\nbackground sources have median redshifts z_L = 0.6 and z_S = 2.5, respectively,\nand are observed out to z_L = 1.2 and z_S = 4.2. We measure the number counts\nof candidate lensed galaxies at 500{\\mu}m and compare them with theoretical\npredictions, finding a good agreement for a maximum magnification of the\nbackground sources in the range 10-20. These values are consistent with the\nmagnification factors derived from the lens modelling of individual systems.\nThe catalogue presented here provides sub- mm bright targets for follow-up\nobservations aimed at exploiting gravitational lensing to study with\nun-precedented details the morphological and dynamical properties of dusty star\nforming regions in z >~ 1.5 galaxies.\n", "  We construct an action which is invariant under the foliation preserving\ndiffeomorphism from the Einstein Hilbert action. Starting from the Einstein\nHilbert action, we introduce the gauge invariance under the anisotropic\nrescaling by using the St\\\"uckelberg method. We then introduce the gauge field\ncorresponds to the anisotropic rescaling, and the St\\\"uckelberg field turns out\nto be the Nambu-Goldstone boson. The Nambu-Goldstone boson, however, is not\ncompletely eaten by the massive gauge field and the Nambu-Goldstone boson can\nbe integrated out from the action. Then the resultant action is a\nHorava-Lifshitz type action which contains $R^3$ term.\n", "  We review some recent results on the norm approximation to the Schr\\\"odinger\ndynamics. We consider $N$ bosons in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with an interaction\npotential of the form $N^{3\\beta-1}w(N^{\\beta}(x-y))$ with $0\\le \\beta<1/2$,\nand show that in the large $N$ limit, the fluctuations around the condensate\ncan be effectively described using Bogoliubov approximation.\n", "  The \\emph{equations of Boussinesq approximation} (EBA) for an incompressible\nand inhomogeneous in density fluid are analyzed from a viewpoint of the\nasymptotic theory. A systematic scaling shows that there is an infinite number\nof related asymptotic models. We have divided them into three classes: `poor',\n`reasonable' and `good' Boussinesq approximations. Each model can be\ncharacterized by two parameters $q$ and $k$, where $q =1, 2, 3, \\dots$ and\n$k=0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2,\\dots$. Parameter $q$ is related to the `quality' of\napproximation, while $k$ gives us an infinite set of possible scales of\nvelocity, time, viscosity, \\emph{etc.} Increasing $q$ improves the quality of a\nmodel, but narrows the limits of its applicability. Parameter $k$ allows us to\nvary the scales of time, velocity and viscosity and gives us the possibility to\nconsider any initial and boundary conditions. In general, we discover and\nclassify a rich variety of possibilities and restrictions, which are hidden\nbehind the routine use of the Boussinesq approximation. The paper is devoted to\nthe multiplicity of scalings and related restrictions. We do not study any\nparticular solutions and particular failures of EBA.\n", "  We study the synthesis of optimal control policies for large-scale\nmulti-agent systems. The optimal control design induces a parsimonious control\nintervention by means of l-1, sparsity-promoting control penalizations. We\nstudy instantaneous and infinite horizon sparse optimal feedback controllers.\nIn order to circumvent the dimensionality issues associated to the control of\nlarge-scale agent-based models, we follow a Boltzmann approach. We generate\n(sub)optimal controls signals for the kinetic limit of the multi-agent\ndynamics, by sampling of the optimal solution of the associated two-agent\ndynamics. Numerical experiments assess the performance of the proposed sparse\ndesign.\n", "  Blind Source Separation (BSS) is an active domain of Classical Information\nProcessing. The development of Quantum Information Processing has made possible\nthe appearance of Blind Quantum Source Separation (BQSS). This article\ndiscusses some consequences of the existence of the entanglement phenomenon,\nand of the probabilistic aspect of quantum measurements, upon BQSS solutions.\nIt focuses on a pair of spins initially separately prepared in a pure state,\nand then with an undesired coupling between these spins. An unentanglement\ncriterion is established for the state of an arbitrary qubit pair, expressed\nfirst with probability amplitudes and secondly with probabilities. It is\nstressed that the concept of statistical independence of the sources, widely\nused in classical BSS, should be used with care in BQSS, and possibly replaced\nby some disentanglement principle. It is shown that the coefficients of the\ndevelopment of any qubit pair pure state, over the states of the standard\nbasis, can be expressed with the probabilities of results in the measurements\nof well-chosen spin components.\n", "  Bonner Spheres have been used widely for the measurement of neutron spectra\nwith neutron energies ranged from thermal up to at least 20 MeV. A Bonner\nSphere neutron spectrometer (BSS) was developed by extending a Berthold LB 6411\nneutron-dose-rate meter. The BSS consists of a $^{3}$He thermal-neutron\ndetector with integrated electronics, a set of eight polyethylene spherical\nshells and two optional lead shells of various sizes. The response matrix of\nthe BSS was calculated with GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation. The BSS had a\ncalibration uncertainty of $\\pm 8.6\\%$ and a detector background rate of $(1.57\n\\pm 0.04) \\times 10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. A spectral unfolding code NSUGA was\ndeveloped. The NSUGA code utilizes genetic algorithms and has been shown to\nperform well in the absence of a priori information.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the analysis of polyatomic gases within the\nframework of kinetic theory. Internal degrees of freedom are modeled using a\nsingle continuous variable corresponding to the molecular internal energy.\nNon-equilibrium velocity distribution function, compatible with macroscopic\nfield variables, is constructed using the maximum entropy principle. A proper\ncollision cross section is constructed which obeys the micro-reversibility\nrequirement. The source term and entropy production rate are determined in the\nform which generalizes the results obtained within the framework of extended\nthermodynamics. They can be adapted to appropriate physical situations due to\nthe presence of parameters. They are also compared with the results obtained\nusing BGK approximation. For the proposed model the shock structure problem is\nthoroughly analyzed.\n", "  Bed load transport is the movement of particles along the top of a bed\nthrough rolling, saltation, and suspension created by turbulent lift above the\nbed surface. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the\nidea that bed load transport is significant for proppant transport during\nhydraulic fracturing. However, scaling arguments suggest that bed load\ntransport is only dominant in the laboratory and is negligible at the field\nscale. I review laboratory experiments that have been used to develop concepts\nof bed load transport in hydraulic fracturing. I also review the scaling\narguments and laboratory results that have been used to argue that viscous\ndrag, not bed load transport, is dominant at the field scale. I compare\nliterature correlations for fluvial sediment transport and for pipeline slurry\ntransport with published laboratory data on proppant transport in slot flow.\nThe comparisons indicate that fluvial transport correlations are suitable for\npredicting the rate of sediment erosion due to flow of proppant-free fluid over\na bed. The pipeline slurry correlations are suitable for predicting the ability\nof proppant that is already in suspension to flow in bed transport without\nsettling, but only if the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot is\nclose to unity. This can occur at the laboratory scale, but not in the field.\nThe comparison indicates that at low rates of proppant flow, the equilibrium\nbed height in a laboratory proppant transport experiment can be predicted from\npipeline slurry correlations. However, as the volumetric flow rate and the\naspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of\nthe pipeline slurry correlations breaks down. Laboratory experiments using\nhigher volumetric flow rate indicate that bed load transport rates are too low\nto be significant at the field scale, even if the flow velocity is very high.\n", "  We present a detailed temperature-dependent spectroscopic study of DyMnO3\nsingle crystals with distorted perovskite structure. Energies of 36\ncrystal-field levels of Dy3+ in paramagnetic DyMnO3 were determined. The Dy3+\nground Kramers doublet does not split at T_N^Mn = 39 K and splits below Tlock =\n18 K. The splitting grows fast at temperatures near T_N^Dy = 6.5 K and reaches\n{\\Delta}0 = 11 cm-1 at 4 K. Using the experimental temperature dependence\n{\\Delta}0(T), we calculate the dysprosium magnetic moment mDy(T) and the\ndysprosium contribution into specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.\nAnalysing all the experimental data, we conclude that the Dy-Mn interaction is\nof the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type.\n", "  The radiotherapy of malignant diseases has reached much progress during the\npast decade. Thus, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and VMAT\n(Rapidarc) now belong to the standard modalities of tumor treatment with high\nenergy radiation in clinical practice. In recent time, the particle therapy\n(protons and partially with heavy carbon ions) has reached an important\ncompletion of these modalities with regard to some suitable applications. In\nspite of this enrichment essential features need further research activities\nand publications in this field: Nuclear reactions and the role of the released\nneutrons, electron capture of positively charged nuclei at lower projectile\nenergies (e.g. in the environment of the Bragg peak and at the distal end of\nthe particle track), correct dose delivery in scanning methods by accounting\nfor the influence of the lateral scatter of beam-lets. Deconvolution methods\ncan help to overcome these problems, which already occur in radiotherapy of\nvery small photon beams [1 - 8].\n", "  We show that four Lax-integrable 3D differential equations are related via\nB\\\"acklund transformations.\n", "  ePSproc provides codes for post-processing results from ePolyScat (ePS), a\nsuite of codes for the calculation of quantum scattering problems, developed\nand released by Luchesse \\& co-workers (Gianturco et al. 1994)(Natalense and\nLucchese 1999)(R. R. Lucchese and Gianturco 2016). ePS is a powerful\ncomputational engine for solving scattering problems, but its inherent\ncomplexity, combined with additional post-processing requirements, ranging from\nsimple visualizations to more complex processing involving further calculations\nbased on ePS outputs, present a significant barrier to use for most\nresearchers. ePSproc aims to lower this barrier by providing a range of\nfunctions for reading, processing and plotting outputs from ePS. Since ePS\ncalculations are currently finding multiple applications in AMO physics (see\nbelow), ePSproc is expected to have significant reuse potential in the\ncommunity, both as a basic tool-set for researchers beginning to use ePS, and\nas a more advanced post-processing suite for those already using ePS. ePSproc\nis currently written for Matlab/Octave, and distributed via Github:\nhttps://github.com/phockett/ePSproc.\n", "  The invariant theory for conformal hypersurfaces is studied by treating these\nas the conformal infinity of a conformally compact manifold: For a given\nconformal hypersurface embedding, a distinguished ambient metric is found\n(within its conformal class) by solving a singular version of the Yamabe\nproblem. Using existence results for asymptotic solutions to this problem, we\ndevelop the details of how to proliferate conformal hypersurface invariants. In\naddition we show how to compute the the solution's asymptotics. We also develop\na calculus of conformal hypersurface invariant differential operators and in\nparticular, describe how to compute extrinsically coupled analogues of\nconformal Laplacian powers. Our methods also enable the study of integrated\nconformal hypersurface invariants and their functional variations. As a main\napplication we develop new higher dimensional analogues of the Willmore energy\nfor embedded surfaces. This complements recent progress on the existence and\nconstruction of such functionals.\n", "  There are two possible mechanisms to imprint planet signatures in the\nchemical composition of Sun-like stars: i) dust condensation at the early\nstages of planet formation, causing a depletion of refractory elements in the\ngas accreted by the star in the late stages of its formation; ii) planet\nengulfment, enriching the host star in lithium and refractory elements. We\ndiscuss both planet signatures, the influence of galactic chemical evolution,\nand the importance of binaries composed of stellar twins as laboratories to\nverify abundance anomalies imprinted by planets.\n", "  In published papers, the Gibbs free energy of ferroelectric materials has\nusually been quantified by the retention of 6th or 8th order polarization\nterms. In this paper, a newly analytical model of Gibbs free energy, thereout,\na new model of polarization-electric field hysteresis loops in ferroelectric\nmaterials has been derived mathematically. As a model validation, four patterns\nof polarization-electric field hysteresis loops of ferroelectric materials have\nbeen depicted by using the model. The calculated results indicated that the\nself-similar model can characterize the various patterns of hysteresis loops in\nferroelectric materials through adjusting the external excitation or the\nsynthetically parameter (e.g., electric, temperature, and stress, etc.)\nemployed in the model.\n", "  We present the technical design for the SuperCDMS high-voltage, low-mass dark\nmatter detectors, designed to be sensitive to dark matter down to 300 MeV/$c^2$\nin mass and resolve individual electron-hole pairs from low-energy scattering\nevents in high-purity Ge and Si crystals. In this paper we discuss some of the\nstudies and technological improvements which have allowed us to design such a\nsensitive detector, including advances in phonon sensor design and detector\nsimulation. With this design we expect to achieve better than 10 eV (5 eV)\nphonon energy resolution in our Ge (Si) detectors, and recoil energy resolution\nbelow 1eV by exploiting Luke-Neganov phonon generation of charges accelerated\nin high fields.\n", "  We present ground state spectra of mesons containing a charm and a bottom\nquark. For the charm quark we use overlap valence quarks while a\nnon-relativistic formulation is utilized for the bottom quark on a background\nof 2+1+1 flavors HISQ gauge configurations generated by the MILC collaboration.\nThe hyperfine splitting between $1S$ states of $B_c$ mesons is found to be\n$56^{+4}_{-3}$ MeV. We also study the baryons containing only charm and bottom\nquarks and predict their ground state masses. Results are obtained at three\nlattice spacings.\n", "  The mid-rapidity transverse momentum spectra of hadrons and the available\nrapidity distributions of the strange hadrons produced in p-p collisions at LHC\nenergy root(snn) = 0.9 TeV and root(snn)= 7.0 TeV have been studied using a\nunified statistical thermal freeze-out model. The calculated results are found\nto be in good agreement with the experimental data. The theoretical fits of the\ntransverse momentum spectra using the model calculations provide the thermal\nfreeze-out conditions in terms of the temperature and collective flow\nparameters for different hadronic species. The study reveal the presence of\nsignificant collective flow and a well defined temperature in the system thus\nindicating the formation of a thermally equilibrated hydrodynamic system in p-p\ncollisions at LHC. Moreover, the fits to the available experimental rapidity\ndistributions data of strange hadrons show the effect of almost complete\ntransparency in p-p collisions at LHC. The transverse momentum distributions of\nprotons and Kaons produced in p-p collisions at root(snn) = 200 GeV and\nroot(snn)= 2.76 TeV have also been reproduced successfully. The model\nincorporates longitudinal as well as a transverse hydrodynamic flow. The\ncontributions from heavier decay resonances have also been taken into account.\nWe have also imposed the criteria of exact strangeness conservation in the\nsystem.\n", "  We consider generation of diffusive radiation by a charged particle passing\nthrough a random stack of plates in the infrared region. Diffusive radiation\noriginates due to multiple scattering of pseudophotons on the plates. To\nenhance the radiation intensity one needs to make the scattering more\neffective. For this goal we suggest to use materials with negative dielectric\nconstant .\n", "  This research is on the nonlinear dynamics of a two-sided electrostatically\nactuated capacitive micro-beam. The microresonator is composed of silicon and\nPZT as a piezoelectric material. PZT is functionally distributed along the\nheight of the micro-beam according to the power law distribution. The\nmicro-resonator is simultaneously subjected to DC piezoelectric and two-sided\nelectrostatic actuations. The DC piezoelectric actuation leads to the\ngeneration of an axial force along the length of the micro-beam and this is\nused as a tuning tool to shift the primary resonance of the micro-resonator.\nThe governing equation of the motion is derived by the minimization of the\nHamiltonian and generalized to the viscously damped systems. The periodic\nsolutions in the vicinity of the primary resonance are detected by means of the\nshooting method and their stability is investigated by determining the\nso-called Floquet exponents of the perturbed motions. The basins of attraction\ncorresponding to three individual periodic orbits are determined. The results\ndepict that the higher the amplitude of the periodic orbit, the smaller is the\narea of the attractor\n", "  Consider the semiclassical limit, as the Planck constant $\\hbar\\ri 0$, of\nbound states of a one-dimensional quantum particle in multiple potential wells\nseparated by barriers. We show that, for each eigenvalue of the Schr\\\"odinger\noperator, the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition is satisfied at least for\none potential well. The proof of this result relies on a study of real wave\nfunctions in a neighborhood of a potential barrier. We show that, at least from\none side, the barrier fixes the phase of wave functions in the same way as a\npotential barrier of infinite width. On the other hand, it turns out that for\neach well there exists an eigenvalue in a small neighborhood of every point\nsatisfying the Bohr-Sommerfeld condition.\n", "  The results of the study of gamma-transition description in fast neutron\ncapture and photofission are presented. Recent experimental data were used,\nnamely, the spectrum of prompt gamma-rays in the energy range 2{\\div}18 MeV\nfrom 14-MeV neutron capture in natural Ni and isomeric ratios in primary\nfragments of photofission of the isotopes of U, Np and Pu by bremsstrahlung\nwith end-point energies $E_e$= 10.5, 12 and 18 MeV. The data are compared with\nthe theoretical calculations performed within EMPIRE 3.2 and TALYS 1.6 codes.\nThe mean value of angular momenta and their distributions were determined in\nthe primary fragments $^{84}$Br, $^{97}$Nb, $^{90}$Rb, $^{131,133}$Te,\n$^{132}$Sb, $^{132,134}$I, $^{135}$Xe of photofissions. An impact of the\ncharacteristics of nuclear excited states on the calculation results is studied\nusing different models for photon strength function and nuclear level density.\n", "  We adapt the classical Q-method based on a reddening-free parameter\nconstructed from three passband magnitudes to thwe filter set of IPHAS survey\nand combine it with the maximum-likelihood-based cluster parameter estimator by\nNaylor and Jeffries (2006) to determine the extinction, heliocentric distances,\nand ages of young open clusters using Halpha and ri data. Themethod is also\nadapted for the case of signific ant variations of extinction across the\ncluster rfield. Our technique is validated by comparing the colour excesses,\ndisdtances, and ages determined in this study with the most bona fide values\nreported for the 18 well-studied young open clusters in the past, and a fairly\ngood agreement is found between our extinction and distance estimnates and\nearlier published results. although our age estimates are not very consistent\nwith those published by other authors. We also show that individual extinction\nvalues can be determined rather accurately for stars with (r-i)0>0.1. Our\nresults open up a prospect fpr determining a uniform set of parameters for\nnorthern clusters based on homogeneous photometric data, and for searching for\nnew, hitherto undiscovered open clusters.\n", "  Meson masses and decay constants in the large $N$ limit of SU($N$) gauge\ntheory are determined using the twisted Eguchi-Kawai reduced model. To this\nend, we make use of a recently defined smearing method valid on the one-point\nlattice. This procedure, in combination with a variational analysis, allows to\nobtain reliable values for these quantities.\n", "  This article examines the spatial {dynamics of bed load particles} in water.\nWe focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is\ndefined as the number of moving particles per unit bed {length}. Based on a\nstochastic model recently proposed by \\citet{Ancey2013}, we derive the second\nmoment of particle activity analytically; that is the spatial correlation\nfunctions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large\nmoving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that\nfluctuations of particle activity are scale-dependent. Two characteristic\nlengths emerge from the model: a saturation length $\\ell_{sat}$ describing the\nlength needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the\nhomogeneous solution, and a correlation length $\\ell_c$ describing the typical\nsize of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless P\\'eclet number can also be\ndefined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data\nsets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic\nmodel describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In\nparticular, we show that $\\ell_c$ and $\\ell_{sat}$ may be relatively large\ncompared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter,\nwater depth, bed form wavelength, flume length...) suggesting that the spatial\nfluctuations of particle activity have a non-negligible impact on the average\ntransport process.\n", "  Steep slope streams show large fluctuations of sediment discharge across\nseveral time scales. These fluctuations may be inherent to the internal\ndynamics of the sediment transport process. A probabilistic framework thus\nseems appropriate to analyze such a process. In this letter, we present an\nexperimental study of bedload transport over a steep slope flume for small to\nmoderate Shields numbers. The sampling technique allows the acquisition of\nhigh-resolution time series of the solid discharge. The resolved time scales\nrange from $10^{-2}$s up to $10^{5}$s. We show that two distinct time scales\ncan be observed in the probability density function for the waiting time\nbetween moving particles. We make the point that the separation of time scales\nis related to collective dynamics. Proper statistics of a Markov process\nincluding collective entrainment are derived. The separation of time scales is\nrecovered theoretically for low entrainment rates.\n", "  The recently reported wobbling bands in $^{135}$Pr are investigated by the\ncollective Hamiltonian, in which the collective parameters, including the\ncollective potential and the mass parameter, are respectively determined from\nthe tilted axis cranking (TAC) model and the harmonic frozen alignment (HFA)\nformula. It is shown that the experimental energy spectra of both yrast and\nwobbling bands are well reproduced by the collective Hamiltonian. It is\nconfirmed that the wobbling mode in $^{135}$Pr changes from transverse to\nlongitudinal with the rotational frequency. The mechanism of this transition is\nrevealed by analyzing the effective moments of inertia of the three principal\naxes, and the corresponding variation trend of the wobbling frequency is\ndetermined by the softness and shapes of the collective potential.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to study the mixed linear quadratic Gaussian\n(LQG) and $H_\\infty$ optimal control problem for linear quantum stochastic\nsystems, where the controller itself is also a quantum system, often referred\nto as \"coherent feedback controller\". A lower bound of the LQG control is\nproved. Then two different methods, rank constrained linear matrix inequality\n(LMI) method and genetic algorithm are proposed for controller design. A\npassive system (cavity) and a non-passive one (degenerate parametric amplifier,\nDPA) demonstrate the effectiveness of these two proposed algorithms.\n", "  High level ab initio calculations ranging from coupled cluster methods\nincluding explicitly correlated approaches to standard second order\nM{\\o}ller-Plesset theory using spin scaling (SOS-MP2) have been performed on\nsandwich and slipped parallel dimer structures of a series of quasi\none-dimensional acenes and on two-dimensional sheets containing the series\npyrene to coronene encircled with two layers of benzene rings. Sandwich\n(graphitic AA type) and slipped parallel (AB type) structures were considered\nand, within given symmetry restrictions, full geometry optimizations were\nperformed. Basis set superposition effects have been considered. The computed\ngeometries show a significant biconcave deviation of the twodimensional sheets\nfrom planarity with the central intersheet C...C distances considerably smaller\nthat van der Waals distances. The computed intersheet binding energy per carbon\natom extrapolated for N ->$\\infty$ of -74.3 meV (1.713 kcal/mol)/atom agrees\nquite well with the experimental defoliation energy of -52 meV (1.199\nkcal/mol)/atom (-67 meV (1.545 kcal/mol)/carbon atom without corrections for H\nbinding contributions) for polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from graphite. A\nlimited investigation of density functional theory (DFT) calculations using\nempirical dispersion contributions has been performed also showing a\nsignificant underbinding character of the D3 method. For most of the DFT\nvariants investigated the graphene sheet models retain a quasi-planar structure\nin strong contrast to the aforementioned SOS-MP2 results.\n", "  The decision by the United Kingdom (UK) government in 2007 that the country\nshould build a 33GW wind fleet, capable of generating 25 percent of the UK\nelectricity requirement, was controversial. Proponents argued that it was the\nmost attractive means of lowering the UK greenhouse gas emissions, whereas\nopponents noted that it would result in an unnecessary and burdensome\nadditional expense to industry and households. Subsequently there have been\ncalls for the wind fleet target to be further increased to perhaps 50 percent\nof demand. Although the National Grid has had little difficulty in\naccommodating the current output of about 10 percent of the total demand on the\ngrid, this will not be the case for a substantially larger wind fleet. When the\nwind blows strongly, turbines shed wind which is surplus to demand, leading to\nsignificant reductions in generating efficiency. The purpose of the research\ndescribed in this paper has been to develop a method for investigating the\nlikely performance of future large wind fleets. The method relies on the use of\nmathematical models based on National Grid records for 2013 to 2015, each year\nbeing separately analysed. It was found that the incremental load factor of the\nwind fleet will be reduced to 63 percent of its current level should the wind\nfleet increase from its current size of 14GW to 35GW, assuming a base load of\n15GW\n", "  One of the greatest challenges to using large-eddy simulations (LES) in\nengineering applications is the large number of grid points required near\nwalls. To mitigate this issue, researchers often couple LES with a simplified\nmodel of the flow close to the wall, known as the wall model. One feature\ncommon to most wall models is that the first few (about 3) grid points must be\nlocated below the inviscid log-layer, and the grid must have near-isotropic\nresolution near the wall. Hence, wall-modeled LES may still require a large\nnumber of grid points in both the wall-normal and span-wise directions. Because\nof these requirements, wall-modeled LES is still unfeasible in many\napplications. We present a new formulation of wall-modeled LES that is being\ndeveloped to address this issue. In this formulation, LES is used to solve only\nfor the features of the velocity field that can be adequately represented on\nthe LES grid. The effects of the unresolved features are captured by imposing\nan integral balance of kinetic energy in the near-wall region. This integral\nenergy balance translates into a dynamic partial differential equation defined\non the walls, which is coupled to the LES equations. We discuss details of the\nnew formulation and present results obtained in laminar channel flows.\n", "  We consider a kernel based harmonic analysis of \"boundary,\" and boundary\nrepresentations. Our setting is general: certain classes of positive definite\nkernels. Our theorems extend (and are motivated by) results and notions from\nclassical harmonic analysis on the disk. Our positive definite kernels include\nthose defined on infinite discrete sets, for example sets of vertices in\nelectrical networks, or discrete sets which arise from sampling operations\nperformed on positive definite kernels in a continuous setting.\n  Below we give a summary of main conclusions in the paper: Starting with a\ngiven positive definite kernel $K$ we make precise generalized boundaries for\n$K$. They are measure theoretic \"boundaries.\" Using the theory of Gaussian\nprocesses, we show that there is always such a generalized boundary for any\npositive definite kernel.\n", "  We present a local Master equation for open system dynamics in two forms:\nMarkovian and non-Markovian. Both have a wider range of validity than the\nLindblad equation investigated by Davies. For low temperatures, they do not\nrequire coupling to be exponentially weak in the system size. If the state\nremains a low bond dimension Matrix Product State throughout the evolution, the\nlocal equation can be simulated in time polynomial in system size.\n", "  Pairing in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors and its origin remain\namong the most enduring mysteries in condensed matter physics. With\ncross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy/ spectroscopy, we clearly reveal\nthe spatial-dependence or inhomogeneity of the superconducting gap structure of\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi2212) and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ (YBCO)\nalong their $c$-axes on a scale shorter than the interlayer spacing. By\ntunneling into the (100) plane of a Bi2212 single crystal and a YBCO film, we\nobserve both U-shaped tunneling spectra with extended flat zero-conductance\nbottoms, and V-shaped gap structures, in different regions of each sample. On\nthe YBCO film, tunneling into a (110) surface only reveals a U-shaped gap\nwithout any zero-bias peak. Our analysis suggests that the U-shaped gap is\nlikely a nodeless superconducting gap. The V-shaped gap has a very small\namplitude, and is likely proximity-induced by regions having the larger\nU-shaped gap.\n", "  Chimera states, which consist of coexisting domains of coherent and\nincoherent parts, have been observed in a variety of systems. Most of previous\nworks on chimera states have taken into account specific form of interaction\nbetween oscillators, for example sinusoidal coupling or diffusive coupling.\nHere, we investigate chimera dynamics in nonlocally coupled phase oscillators\nwith biharmonic interaction. We find novel chimera states with features such as\nthat oscillators in the same coherent cluster may split into two groups with a\nphase difference between them at around pi/2 and that oscillators in adjacent\ncoherent clusters may have a phase difference close to pi/2. The different\nimpacts of the coupling ranges in the first and the second harmonic\ninteractions on chimera dynamics are investigated based on the synchronous\ndynamics in globally coupled phase oscillators. Our study suggests a new\ndirection in the field of chimera dynamics.\n", "  Rieger et al (1984) reported observations of a 154 day periodicity in flares\nduring solar cycle 21. This paper discusses the observations in the light of a\nsimple empirical planetary model of sunspot emergence. The planetary model\npredicts sunspot emergence when Mercury and Earth approach conjunction and\nMercury approaches the Sun. We show that the reported times of flare activity\nare coherent with the planetary model. While the base period of the model is\n170 days, the average model period, over the interval of flare recordings, is\n157 days due to a 180 degree phase change in the planetary forcing near the\nmiddle of the record interval. We conclude that the periodicity at 154 days\narises when the phase change in planetary forcing and the resulting progressive\nphase change in total sunspot area emergence and flare occurrence shifts the\nmajor peak in the flare spectrum from the planetary forcing period, 170 days,\nto 154 days.\n", "  In this review article, we present a non-equilibrium quantum transport theory\nfor transient electron dynamics in nanodevices based on exact master equation\nderived with the path integral method in the fermion coherent-state\nrepresentation. Applying the exact master equation to nanodevices, we also\nestablish the connection of the reduced density matrix and the transient\nquantum transport current with the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green functions. The\ntheory enables us to study transient quantum transport in nanostructures with\nback-reaction effects from the contacts, with non-Markovian dissipation and\ndecoherence being fully taken into account. In applications, we utilize the\ntheory to specific quantum transport systems, a variety of quantum decoherence\nand quantum transport phenomena involving the non-Markovian memory effect are\ninvestigated in both transient and stationary scenarios at arbitrary initial\ntemperatures of the contacts.\n", "  This article is concerned with the time-harmonic electromagnetic (EM)\nscattering from a generic inhomogeneous medium. It is shown that if there is a\nright corner on the support of the medium, then it scatters every pair of\nincident EM fields, excluding a possible class of EM fields which are of very\nparticular forms. That is, for every pair of admissible incident EM fields, the\ncorresponding scattered wave fields associated to the medium scatterer cannot\nbe identically vanishing outside the support of the medium. Indeed, we achieve\nthe corner scattering result by establishing a stronger result, that shows the\nfailure of the analytic extension across the corner of certain EM fields\nsatisfying the so-called interior transmission eigenvalue problem. This extends\nthe relevant study in [3] for the acoustic scattering governed by the Helmholtz\nequation to the electromagnetic case governed by the Maxwell system.\nSubstantial new challenges arise from the corresponding extension from the\nscalar PDE to the system of PDEs. Our mathematical arguments combine the\nanalysis for interior transmission eigenvalue problems associated to the\nMaxwell system; the derivation of novel orthogonality relation for the\nsolutions of Maxwell systems; the construction of complex-geometrical-optics\n(CGO) solutions for the Maxwell system with new Lp-estimates (p > 6) on the\nremainder terms; and the proof of the non-vanishing property for the Laplace\ntransform of vectorial homogeneous harmonic polynomials.\n", "  Quantum information processors need to be protected against errors and\nfaults. One of the most widely considered fault-tolerant architecture is based\non surface codes. While the general principles of these codes are well\nunderstood and basic code properties such as minimum distance and rate are easy\nto characterize, a code's average performance depends on the detailed geometric\nlayout of the qubits. To date, optimizing a surface code architecture and\ncomparing different geometric layouts relies on costly numerical simulations.\nHere, we propose a benchmarking algorithm for simulating the performance of\nsurface codes, and generalizations thereof, that runs in linear time. We\nimplemented this algorithm in a software that generates performance reports and\nallows to quickly compare different architectures.\n", "  There are many kinds of models which describe the dynamics of dark energy\n(DE). Among all we adopt an equation of state (EoS) which varies as a function\nof time. We adopt Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the five\nparameters of our models. As a consequence, we can show the characteristic\nbehavior of DE during the evolution of the universe. We constrain the EoS of DE\nwith use of the avairable data of gamma-ray bursts and type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) concerning the redshift-luminosity distance relations. As a result, we find\nthat DE is quintessence-like in the early time and phantom-like in the present\nepoch or near the future, where the change occurs rather rapidly at $z\\sim0.3$.\n", "  We consider one system in which the terminal dots of a one-dimensional\nquantum-dot chain couple equally to the left and right leads and study the\ninfluence of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric complex potentials on the quantum\ntransport process. It is found that in the case of the Hermitian Hamiltonian,\nremarkable decoupling and antiresonance phenomena have an opportunity to\nco-occur in the transport process. For the chains with odd(even) dots, all\ntheir even(odd)-numbered molecular states decouple from the leads. Meanwhile,\nantiresonance occurs at the positions of the even(odd)-numbered eigenenergies\nof the sub-chains without terminal dots. When the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\ncomplex potentials are introduced to the terminal dots, the decoupling\nphenomenon is found to transform into the Fano antiresonance. In addition, it\nshows that appropriate magnetic flux can interchange the roles of the odd and\neven molecular states. These results can assist to understand the quantum\ntransport modified by the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete\nsystems.\n", "  We use the TESIS EUV telescope to study the current sheet signatures observed\nduring flux rope eruption. The special feature of the TESIS telescope was its\nability to image the solar corona up to a distance of 2 $R_\\odot$ from the\nSun's center in the Fe 171 \\AA\\ line. The Fe 171 \\AA\\ line emission illuminates\nthe magnetic field lines, and the TESIS images reveal the coronal magnetic\nstructure at high altitudes. The analyzed CME had a core with a spiral-flux\nrope-structure. The spiral shape indicates that the flux rope radius varied\nalong its length. The flux rope had a complex temperature structure: cold legs\n(70 000 K, observed in He 304 \\AA\\ line) and a hotter core (0.7 MK, observed in\nFe 171 \\AA\\ line). Such structure contradicts the common assumption that the\nCME core is a cold prominence. When the CME impulsively accelerated, a dark\ndouble Y-structure appeared below the flux rope. The Y-structure timing,\nlocation, and morphology agree with the previously performed MHD simulations of\nthe current sheet. We interpreted the Y-structure as a hot envelope of the\ncurrent sheet and hot reconnection outflows. The Y-structure had a thickness\n6.0 Mm. Its length increased over time from 79 Mm to more than 411 Mm.\n", "  Li2FeSiO4 is an important alternative cathode for next generation Li-ion\nbatteries due to its high theoretical capacity (330 mA h/g). However, its\ndevelopment has faced significant challenges arising from structural complexity\nand poor ionic conductivity. In the present work, the relative stability,\nelectronic structure, thermodynamics, and mechanical properties of potential\ncathode material Li2FeSiO4 and its polymorphs have been studied by\nstate-of-the-art density-functional calculations. Among the 11 structural\narrangements considered for the structural optimization calculations, the\nexperimentally known monoclinic P21 modification is found to be the ground\nstate structure. The application of pressure originates a sequence of phase\ntransitions according to P21 - Pmn21 - I222, and the estimated values of the\ncritical pressure are found to be 0.38 and 1.93 GPa. The electronic structures\nreveal that all the considered polymorphs have a non-metallic character, with\nband gap values varying between 3.0 and 3.2 eV. The energy differences between\ndifferent polymorphs are small, and most of these structures are dynamically\nstable. On the other hand, the calculation of single crystal elastic constants\nreveals that only few Li2FeSiO4 polymorphs are mechanically stable. At room\ntemperature, the diffusion coefficient calculations of Li2FeSiO4 in different\npolymorphs reveal that Li-ion conductivity of this material is destitute.\n", "  Thin film of silicon is an interesting material for many technological\napplications in electronic industry and in energy harvesting technologies, but\nrequires a method for controlled growth of thin films. The purpose of this\nstudy is to screen a wide variety of Si content precursors for Si ALD reactions\nusing state-of-the-art density-functional calculations. Among the studied 85 Si\ncontent precursors we found that C7H12OSi(Methoxy-trivinyl-silane) and C7H9NSi\n(Benzyliminosilane) show positive indications for ALD reactivity for Si\ndeposition. We believe that this finding will be helpful to develop low-cost,\nhigh-energy efficiency thin-film solar cells for future scale up implementation\nin photovoltaics.\n", "  We propose a method for shortcut to adiabatic control of soliton matter waves\nin harmonic traps. The tunable interaction controlled by Feshbach resonance is\ninversely designed to achieve fast compression of soliton matter waves but\nwithin a short time, as compared to the conventional adiabatic compression.\nThese results pave the way to control the nonlinear dynamics for matter waves\nand optical solitons by using shortcuts to adiabaticity.\n", "  A description is given of a three-dimensional box-shaped graphene (BSG)\nnanostructure formed/uncovered by mechanical cleavage of highly oriented\npyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The discovered nanostructure is a multilayer system\nof parallel hollow channels located along the surface and having quadrangular\ncross-section. The thickness of the channel walls/facets is approximately equal\nto 1 nm. The typical width of channel facets makes about 25 nm, the channel\nlength is 390 nm and more. The investigation of the found nanostructure by\nmeans of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) allows us to draw a conclusion\nthat it is possible to make spatial constructions of graphene similar to the\ndiscovered one by mechanical compression, bending, splitting, and shifting\ngraphite surface layers. The distinctive features of such constructions are the\nfollowing: simplicity of the preparation method, small contact area between\ngraphene planes and a substrate, large surface area, nanometer cross-sectional\nsizes of the channels, large aspect ratio. Potential fields of application\ninclude: ultra-sensitive detectors, high-performance catalytic cells,\nnanochannels for DNA manipulation, nanomechanical resonators, electron\nmultiplication channels, high-capacity sorbents for hydrogen storage.\n", "  The relations between photoionization cross sections and photon radius are\nobtained on basis of quantum mechanics and the particle-like properties of a\nphoton. The photoionization cross sections of H atom and H-like ions, He atom\nand He like ions, alkali metal atoms, and Rydberg atoms are calculated using\nthe relations. The calculation results are found to be good agreement with the\nknown experimental data. The results show that the photoionization cross\nsection is always smaller than the cross section of the photon to ionize the\natom or ion and can be expressed as the product of the cross section of the\nphoton and the probability that electron meets with the photon. These provide\nthe intuitive understanding for the photoionization phenomena and open a new\navenue of research on interaction between a photon and an atom or ion.\n", "  We present the results of experiments on dynamic nuclear polarization and\nrelaxation of 75As in silicon crystals. Experiments are performed in strong\nmagnetic fields of 4.6 T and temperatures below 1 K. At these conditions donor\nelectron spins are fully polarized, and the allowed and forbidden ESR\ntransitions are well resolved. We demonstrate effective nuclear polarization of\n75As nuclei via the Overhauser effect on the time scale of several hundred\nseconds. Excitation of the forbidden transitions leads to a polarization\nthrough the solid effect. The relaxation rate of donor nuclei has strong\ntemperature dependence characteristic of Orbach process.\n", "  In many lattice simulations with dynamical quarks, radial or orbital\nexcitations of hadrons lie near multihadron thresholds: it makes the extraction\nof excited states properties more challenging and can introduce some\nsystematics difficult to estimate without an explicit computation of\ncorrelators using interpolating fields strongly coupled to multihadronic\nstates. In a recent study of the strong decay of the first radial excitation of\nthe $B^*$ meson, this issue has been investigated and we have clues that a\ndiquark interpolating field $\\bar{b} \\gamma^i q$ is very weakly coupled to a $B\n\\pi$ $P$-wave state while the situation is quite different if we consider an\ninterpolating field of the kind $\\bar{b} \\nabla^i q$, where $\\vec{\\nabla}$ is a\ncovariant derivative: those statements are based on examining the charge\ndensity distribution.\n", "  The notion of interactional expertise is explained starting with its origins\nand discussing its many applications. Interactional expertise is the ability to\nunderstand a technical area purely be deeply immersed in its\n'practice-language' without actually practising. One of its many applications\nis to explain how large sciences are managed.\n", "  We present a study of the evolution of the optical and X-ray fluxes during\noutbursts of two short-period cataclysmic variables, the confirmed intermediate\npolar CC Scl and the intermediate polar candidate FS Aur. We found that the\nX-ray and optical light curves are well correlated in both objects, although\nthe amplitudes of outbursts in X-rays are smaller than those in the optical.\nThe ratio of the outburst amplitudes in X-rays and the optical in both objects\nis close to ~0.6. This is significantly higher than was observed during the\noutburst of the non-magnetic dwarf nova U Gem, in which this ratio was only\n~0.03. The obtained data also suggest that the dependence between the X-ray and\noptical fluxes must steepen significantly toward very low accretion rates and\nvery low fluxes. Similarities in the behaviour of CC Scl and FS Aur indicate\nstrongly the magnetic nature of the white dwarf in FS Aur.\n", "  Within the last decade powerful methods have been developed to study surfaces\nusing bright low-energy positron beams. These novel analysis tools exploit the\nunique properties of positron interaction with surfaces, which comprise the\nabsence of exchange interaction, repulsive crystal potential and positron\ntrapping in delocalized surface states at low energies. By applying reflection\nhigh-energy positron diffraction (RHEPD) one can benefit from the phenomenon of\ntotal reflection below a critical angle that is not present in electron surface\ndiffraction. Therefore, RHEPD allows the determination of the atom positions of\n(reconstructed) surfaces with outstanding accuracy. The main advantages of\npositron annihilation induced Auger-electron spectroscopy (PAES) are the\nmissing secondary electron background in the energy region of Auger-transitions\nand its topmost layer sensitivity for elemental analysis. In order to enable\nthe investigation of the electron polarization at surfaces low-energy\nspin-polarized positrons are used to probe the outermost electrons of the\nsurface. Furthermore, in fundamental research the preparation of well defined\nsurfaces tailored for the production of bound leptonic systems plays an\noutstanding role. In this report, it is envisaged to cover both, the\nfundamental aspects of positron surface interaction and the present status of\nsurface studies using modern positron beam techniques.\n", "  On-the-fly quantum nonadiabatic dynamics for large systems greatly benefits\nfrom the adiabatic representation readily available from the electronic\nstructure programs. However, frequently occurring in this representation\nconical intersections introduce non-trivial geometric or Berry phases which\nrequire a special treatment for adequate modelling of the nuclear dynamics. We\nanalyze two approaches for nonadiabatic dynamics using the time-dependent\nvariational principle and the adiabatic representation. The first approach\nemploys adiabatic electronic functions with global parametric dependence on the\nnuclear coordinates. The second approach uses adiabatic electronic functions\nobtained only at the centres of moving localized nuclear basis functions (e.g.\nfrozen-width Gaussians). Unless a gauge transformation is used to enforce\nsingle-valued boundary conditions, the first approach fails to capture the\ngeometric phase. In contrast, the second approach accounts for the geometric\nphase naturally because of the absence of the global nuclear coordinate\ndependence in the electronic functions.\n", "  Previous work has presented both a theoretical foundation for designing\nterrain park jumps that control landing impact and computer software to\naccomplish this task. US ski resorts have been reluctant to adopt this more\nengineered approach to jump design, in part due to questions of feasibility.\nThe present study demonstrates this feasibility. It describes the design,\nconstruction, measurement and experimental testing of such a jump. It improves\non previous efforts with more complete instrumentation, a larger range of jump\ndistances, and a new method for combining jumper- and board-mounted\naccelerometer data to estimate equivalent fall height, a measure of impact\nseverity. It unequivocally demonstrates the efficacy of the engineering design\napproach, namely that it is possible and practical to design and build free\nstyle terrain park jumps with landing surface shapes that control for landing\nimpact as predicted by the theory.\n", "  It is an appealing possibility that the observed dark matter density in the\nuniverse can be fully explained by SUSY. The current experimental knowledge\nindicates that this possibility strongly favors a co-annihilation scenario. In\nsuch scenarios, the mass difference between the next-to-lightest SUSY particle\n(the NLSP) and the lightest one (the LSP) is quite small, which assures that\nthe annihilation cross-section is sufficient not to predict a too large\nabundance of dark matter. However, the small mass difference also means that\nobserving SUSY becomes hard at hadron colliders, where the observation hinges\non the tell-tale signature of missing transverse energy: if the mass difference\nNLSP-to-LSP is small, only little energy is carried away by the invisible LSP.\nThis is also true even if several other SUSY particles are within the kinematic\nreach, since these states would to a large extent decay via cascades ending\nwith an NLSP to LSP decay. A lepton collider does not have this problem. The\nclean environment and known initial state at such machines assures that SUSY\ncan be detected even if the mass difference is very small, provided the\ncenter-of-mass energy is sufficiently high. We present prospects for\nobservation and precision characterization of SUSY with small mass differences\nat the ILC, based on detailed simulations of the ILD detector concept. The\nresulting possibility to predict the dark matter relic density is evaluated and\ncompared to the precision obtained from the Planck mission. Taking a specific\nmodel as an example, we also discuss the synergies from combining ILC and\nHL-LHC results.\n", "  In this article we give in analytical closed form the solutions of the\nDirechlet problems for the Laplace equations with inverse square and singular\nP\\\"oschl-Teller potentials\n", "  The manuscript discusses a simple model on the Thin Shell Instability (TSI)\ngrowth phenomenon at early stage, by only imposing the fulfillment of\nconservation laws; and in particular just applying the laws of mass and linear\nmomentum conservation, without taking into account the energy partitioning\ninside the thin shell.\n", "  The memristor is the fundamental non-linear circuit element, with uses in\ncomputing and computer memory. ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory) is a\nresistive switching memory proposed as a non-volatile memory. In this review we\nshall summarise the state of the art for these closely-related fields,\nconcentrating on titanium dioxide, the well-utilised and archetypal material\nfor both. We shall cover material properties, switching mechanisms and models\nto demonstrate what ReRAM and memristor scientists can learn from each other\nand examine the outlook for these technologies.\n", "  Two semi-analytical one-degree-of-freedom secular models are presented for\nthe motion of small bodies beyond Neptune. A special attention is given to\ntrajectories entirely exterior to the planetary orbits. The first one is the\nwell-known non-resonant model of Kozai (1962) adapted to the transneptunian\nregion. Contrary to previous papers, the dynamics is fully characterized with\nrespect to the fixed parameters. A maximum perihelion excursion possible of\n16.4 AU is determined. The second model handles the occurrence of a mean-motion\nresonance with one of the planets. In that case, the one-degree-of-freedom\nintegrable approximation is obtained by postulating the adiabatic invariance,\nand is much more general and accurate than previous secular models found in the\nliterature. It brings out in a plain way the possibility of perihelion\noscillations with a very high amplitude. Such a model could thus be used in\nfuture studies to deeper explore that kind of motion. For complex resonant\norbits (especially of type 1:k), a segmented secular description is necessary\nsince the trajectories are only \"integrable by parts\". The two models are\napplied to the Solar System but the notations are kept general so that it could\nbe used for any quasi-circular and coplanar planetary system.\n", "  The Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) is an Explorer-class mission\nconcept designed to measure the polarization and absolute intensity of the\ncosmic microwave background. In the following, we report on the design,\nfabrication, and performance of the multimode polarization-sensitive bolometers\nfor PIXIE, which are based on silicon thermistors. In particular we focus on\nseveral recent advances in the detector design, including the implementation of\na scheme to greatly raise the frequencies of the internal vibrational modes of\nthe large-area, low-mass optical absorber structure consisting of a grid of\nmicromachined, ion-implanted silicon wires. With $\\sim30$ times the absorbing\narea of the spider-web bolometers used by Planck, the tensioning scheme enables\nthe PIXIE bolometers to be robust in the vibrational and acoustic environment\nat launch of the space mission. More generally, it could be used to reduce\nmicrophonic sensitivity in other types of low temperature detectors. We also\nreport on the performance of the PIXIE bolometers in a dark cryogenic\nenvironment.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is one of the past decade's most important\ntools for enabling biology scientists and researchers to explore human health\nand diseases. However, due to the computation complexity of the MD algorithm,\nit takes weeks or even months to simulate a comparatively simple biology entity\non conventional multicore processors. The critical path in molecular dynamics\nsimulations is the force calculation between particles inside the simulated\nenvironment, which has abundant parallelism. Among various acceleration\nplatforms, FPGA is an attractive alternative because of its low power and high\nenergy efficiency. However, due to its high programming cost using RTL, none of\nthe mainstream MD software packages has yet adopted FPGA for acceleration.\n  In this paper we revisit the FPGA acceleration of MD in high-level synthesis\n(HLS) so as to provide affordable programming cost. Our experience with the MD\nacceleration demonstrates that HLS optimizations such as loop pipelining,\nmodule duplication and memory partitioning are essential to improve the\nperformance, achieving a speedup of 9.5X compared to a 12-core CPU. More\nimportantly, we observe that even the fully optimized HLS design can still be\n2X slower than the reference RTL architecture due to the common dynamic\n(conditional) data flow behavior that is not yet supported by current HLS\ntools. To support such behavior, we further customize an array of processing\nelements together with a data-driven streaming network through a common RTL\ntemplate, and fully automate the design flow. Our final experimental results\ndemonstrate a 19.4X performance speedup and 39X energy efficiency for the\nwidely used ApoA1 MD benchmark on the Convey HC1ex FPGA compared to a 12-core\nIntel Xeon server.\n", "  A Jimbo-Miwa like nonlinear differential equation in (3+1)-dimensions is\ndeveloped through a generalized bilinear equation with the generalized bilinear\nderivatives. Based on the generalized bilinear forms, two classes of lump\nsolutions, rationally localized in all directions in the space, and a class of\ncomplex lump type solution are generated from a Maple search of quadratic\npolynomial function solution to the proposed Jimbo-Miwa like equation. The\napposite conditions to assurance analyticity and rational localization of the\nsolutions are offered. Each of the resulting lump solutions hold six free\nparameters, two of which are due to the translation invariance of the\nJimbo-Miwa like equations and four of which only require to satisfy the\npresented apposite conditions of being lump solutions. We also generate circle\nor ellipse shape solutions from the obtained solutions using different\nconditions on the lumps solutions. Moreover, figures are given to visualize the\nproperties of the explicit solutions.\n", "  We use a secular representation to describe the long-term dynamics of\ntransneptunian objects in mean-motion resonance with Neptune. The model applied\nis thoroughly described in Saillenfest et al. (2016). The parameter space is\nsystematically explored, showing that the secular trajectories depend little on\nthe resonance order. High-amplitude oscillations of the perihelion distance are\nreported and localised in the space of the orbital parameters. In particular,\nwe show that a large perihelion distance is not a sufficient criterion to\ndeclare that an object is detached from the planets. Such a mechanism, though,\nis found unable to explain the orbits of Sedna or 2012VP113, which are\ninsufficiently inclined (considering their high perihelion distance) to be\npossibly driven by such a resonant dynamics. The secular representation\nhighlights the existence of a high-perihelion accumulation zone due to\nresonances of type 1:k with Neptune. That region is found to be located roughly\nat semi-major axes in [100;300] AU, perihelion distances in [50;70] AU and\ninclinations [30;50]{\\deg}. In addition to the flux of objects directly coming\nfrom the Scattered Disc, numerical simulations show that the Oort Cloud is also\na substantial source for such objects. Naturally, as that mechanism relies on\nfragile captures in high-order resonances, our conclusions break down in the\ncase of a significant external perturber. The detection of such a reservoir\ncould thus be an observational constraint to probe the external Solar System.\n", "  Raman and Brillouin amplification are two schemes for amplifying and\ncompressing short laser pulses in plasma. Analytical models have already been\nderived for both schemes, but the full consequences of these models are little\nknown or used. Here, we present new criteria that govern the evolution of the\nattractor solution for the seed pulse in Raman and Brillouin amplification, and\nshow how the initial laser pulses need to be shaped to control the properties\nof the final amplified seed and improve the amplification efficiency.\n", "  Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and B[e] supergiants (B[e]SGs), though in different\nphases in their evolution, display many features in common. This is partly due\nto the fact that both types of objects undergo strong, often asymmetric mass\nloss, and the ejected material accumulates in shells, rings, or disk-like\nstructures, giving rise to emission from warm molecules and dust. We performed\nan optical spectroscopic survey of northern Galactic emission-line stars aimed\nat identifying tracers for the structure and kinematics of circumstellar\nenvironments. We identified two sets of lines, [O I] and [Ca II], which\noriginate from the discs of B[e]SGs. The same set of lines is observed in V1302\nAql and V509 Cas, which are both hot YHGs. While V1302 Aql is known to have a\ndisc-like structure, the kinematical broadening of the lines in V509 Cas\nsuggest a Keplerian disk or ring around this star alike their hotter B[e]SG\ncounterparts.\n", "  Measurements of top quark production at $e^+e^-$ colliders can provide a leap\nin precision in our knowledge of top quark properties and open a new window on\nphysics beyond the Standard Model. In this contribution the top quark physics\nprospects of linear colliders is reviewed. Progress in detailed full-simulation\nstudies is reported for the highlights of the program. We present the prospects\nfor a measurement of the top quark mass and width in a scan of the beam energy\nthrough the pair production threshold, and discuss new studies of alternative\nmeasurements in continuum production, which are also capable of a precise\ndetermination of the mass in a rigorously defined mass scheme. A precision of\n50 MeV on the $\\overline{MS}$ mass is expected when taking into account the\ndominant systematic uncertainties. Another key measurement is the study of the\ntop quark couplings to electroweak gauge bosons, where form factors can be\ndetermined to 1% precision, an order of magnitude better than those from the\nfull LHC program. New results extend the prospects to different center-of-mass\nenergies and to CP violating form factors. Finally, new studies are presented\nindicating the possibility to detect Flavour Changing Neutral Current decays of\nthe top quark at linear colliders, such as the decay $t \\rightarrow cH$, to a\nbranching ratio of $BR(t\\rightarrow cH) \\sim 10^{-5}$.\n", "  Spectroscopic monitoring of the yellow hypergiant $\\rho$ Cas revealed a new\noutburst in 2013, which is obvious from the development of TiO bands in the\nspectra. Also many atmospheric lines characteristic for a later spectral type\nappear. This spectroscopic outburst is in agreement with the photometric light\ncurve, which displays a drop by about 0.6 mag during the same period.\n", "  In this Letter, we introduce a representation of the electromagnetic field\nfor the analysis and synthesis of the full-wave scattering by a homogeneous\ndielectric object of arbitrary shape in terms of a set of eigenmodes\nindependent of its permittivity. The expansion coefficients are rational\nfunctions of the permittivity. This approach naturally highlights the role of\nplasmonic and photonic modes in any scattering process and suggests a\nstraightforward methodology to design the permittivity of the object to pursue\na prescribed tailoring of the scattered field. We discuss in depth the\napplication of the proposed approach to the analysis and design of the\nscattering properties of a dielectric sphere.\n", "  Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides present a complex electronic\nband structure with a rich orbital contribution to their valence and conduction\nbands. The possibility to consider the electronic states from a tight-binding\nmodel is highly useful for the calculation of many physical properties, for\nwhich first principle calculations are more demanding in computational terms\nwhen having a large number of atoms. Here, we present a set of Slater-Koster\nparameters for a tight-binding model that accurately reproduce the structure\nand the orbital character of the valence and conduction bands of single layer\nMX$_2$, where M = Mo,Wand X = S, Se. The fit of the analytical tight-binding\nHamiltonian is done based on band structure from ab initio calculations. The\nmodel is used to calculate the optical conductivity of the different compounds\nfrom the Kubo formula.\n", "  A plethora of studies in the past decade describe tsunami hazards and study\ntheir evolution from the source to the target coastline, but mainly focus on\ncoastal inundation and maximum runup. Nonetheless, anecdotal reports from\neyewitnesses, photographs and videos suggest counterintuitive flow dynamics,\nfor example rapid initial acceleration when the wave first strikes the initial\nshoreline. Further, the details of the flow field at or within tens of meters\nof the shoreline are exquisitely important in determining damage to structures\nand evacuation times. Based on a set of three-dimensional numerical simulations\nusing solitary waves as a model, we show the spatial-temporal distribution of\nthe flow momentum, kinetic energy and force during the breaking process. We\ninfer that the flow reaches its highest destructive capacity not when flow\nmomentum or kinetic energy reach their maxima, but when flow force reaches its.\nThis occurs in the initial shoreline environment, which needs to be considered\nin nearshore structures design.\n", "  In QCD simulations at small lattice spacings, the topological charge Q\nevolves very slowly and, if this quantity is not properly equilibrated, we\ncould get incorrect results for physical quantities, or incorrect estimates of\ntheir errors. We use the known relation between the dependence of masses and\ndecay constants on the QCD vacuum angle theta and the squared topological\ncharge Q^2 together with chiral perturbation theory results for the dependence\nof masses and decay constants on theta to estimate the size of these effects\nand suggest strategies for dealing with them. For the partially quenched case,\nwe sketch an alternative derivation of the known $\\chi$PT results of Aoki and\nFukaya, using the nonperturbatively correct chiral theory worked out by\nGolterman, Sharpe and Singleton, and by Sharpe and Shoresh. With the MILC\ncollaboration's ensembles of lattices with four flavors of HISQ dynamical\nquarks, we measure the $Q^2$ dependence of masses and decay constants and\ncompare to the $\\chi$PT forms. The observed agreement gives us confidence that\nwe can reliably estimate the errors from slow topology change, and even correct\nfor its leading effects.\n", "  The energy spectrum of the weak solar soft X-ray bursts are investigated\nusing the data of the Interball project.\n", "  Quantum annealing (QA) is a hardware-based heuristic optimization and\nsampling method applicable to discrete undirected graphical models. While\nsimilar to simulated annealing, QA relies on quantum, rather than thermal,\neffects to explore complex search spaces. For many classes of problems, QA is\nknown to offer computational advantages over simulated annealing. Here we\nreport on the ability of recent QA hardware to accelerate training of fully\nvisible Boltzmann machines. We characterize the sampling distribution of QA\nhardware, and show that in many cases, the quantum distributions differ\nsignificantly from classical Boltzmann distributions. In spite of this\ndifference, training (which seeks to match data and model statistics) using\nstandard classical gradient updates is still effective. We investigate the use\nof QA for seeding Markov chains as an alternative to contrastive divergence\n(CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD). Using $k=50$ Gibbs steps, we\nshow that for problems with high-energy barriers between modes, QA-based seeds\ncan improve upon chains with CD and PCD initializations. For these hard\nproblems, QA gradient estimates are more accurate, and allow for faster\nlearning. Furthermore, and interestingly, even the case of raw QA samples (that\nis, $k=0$) achieved similar improvements. We argue that this relates to the\nfact that we are training a quantum rather than classical Boltzmann\ndistribution in this case. The learned parameters give rise to hardware QA\ndistributions closely approximating classical Boltzmann distributions that are\nhard to train with CD/PCD.\n", "  In epidemiology, an epidemic is defined as the spread of an infectious\ndisease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period\nof time. In the marketing context, a message is viral when it is broadly sent\nand received by the target market through person-to-person transmission. This\nspecific marketing communication strategy is commonly referred as viral\nmarketing. Due to this similarity between an epidemic and the viral marketing\nprocess and because the understanding of the critical factors to this\ncommunications strategy effectiveness remain largely unknown, the mathematical\nmodels in epidemiology are presented in this marketing specific field. In this\npaper, an epidemiological model SIR (Susceptible- Infected-Recovered) to study\nthe effects of a viral marketing strategy is presented. It is made a comparison\nbetween the disease parameters and the marketing application, and Matlab\nsimulations are performed. Finally, some conclusions are carried out and their\nmarketing implications are exposed: interactions across the parameters suggest\nsome recommendations to marketers, as the profitability of the investment or\nthe need to improve the targeting criteria of the communications campaigns.\n", "  Grover's search algorithm is the optimal quantum algorithm that can search an\nunstructured database quadratically faster than any known classical algorithm.\nThe role of entanglement and correlations in the search algorithm have been\nstudied in great detail and it is known that entanglement between the qubits is\nnecessary to gain a quadratic speedup, for pure state implementation of the\nGrover search algorithm. Here, we systematically investigate the behavior of\nquantum coherence and monogamy of entanglement in the discrete analogue of the\n$\\textit{analog analogue of Grover search algorithm}$. The analog analogue of\nGrover search is a continuous time quantum algorithm based on the adiabatic\nHamiltonian evolution that gives a quadratic speedup, similar to the original\nGrover search algorithm. We show that the decrease of quantum coherence,\nquantified using various coherence monotones, is a clear signature of attaining\nthe maximum success probability in the analog Grover search. We also show that\nfor any two qubit reduced density matrix of the system, the concurrence evolves\nin close vicinity to the increasing rate of success probability. Furthermore,\nwe show that the system satisfies a $n$-party monogamy inequality for arbitrary\ntimes, hence bounding the amount of $n$-qubit entanglement during the quantum\nsearch.\n", "  We present exact diagonalization and momentum average approximation (MA)\nresults for the single polaron properties of a one-dimensional two-band model\nwith phonon-modulated hopping. At strong electron-phonon coupling, we find a\nnovel type of sharp transition, where the polaron ground state momentum jumps\ndiscontinuously from $k=\\pi$ to $k=0$. The nature and origin of this transition\nis investigated and compared to that of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model,\nwhere a sharp but smooth transition was previously reported. We argue that such\ndiscontinuous transitions are a consequence of the multi-band nature of the\nmodel, and are unlikely to be observed in one-band models. We also show that MA\ndescribes qualitatively and even quantitatively accurately this polaron and its\ntransition. Given its computationally efficient generalization to higher\ndimensions, MA thus promises to allow for accurate studies of electron-phonon\ncoupling in multi-band models in higher dimensions.\n", "  We use a Metropolis algorithm to calculate the finite temperature spectral\nweight of three related models that have identical quasiparticles at $T=0$, if\nthe exchange favors the appearance of a ferromagnetic background. The\nlow-energy behavior of two of the models remains equivalent at finite\ntemperature, however that of the third does not because its low-energy behavior\nis controlled by rare events due to thermal fluctuations, which transfer\nspectral weight well below the $T=0$ quasiparticle peaks and generate a\npseudogap-like phenomenology. Our results demonstrate that having $T=0$ spectra\nwith similar quasiparticles is not a sufficient condition to ensure that two\nmodels are equivalent, {\\em i.e.} that their low-energy properties are similar.\nWe also argue that the pseudogap-like phenomenology is quite generic for models\nof $t$-$J$ type, appearing in any dimension and for carriers injected into both\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic backgrounds.\n", "  We present numerically exact results for the spectral function of a single\ncharge carrier that is injected into an Ising chain at finite temperature $T$.\nBoth ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling between the Ising spins are\nconsidered. The interaction between the carrier and the Ising spins is assumed\nto be on-site and of Ising type, as well. We find that the carrier's spectral\nfunction exhibits a distinctive fine structure of resonances that are due to\nthe temporary entrapping of the carrier inside small magnetic domains. The\nconnection to models of disordered binary alloys where similar effects can\noccur is explained. We use these results to construct an accurate\n(quasi)analytic approximation for low and medium-$T$ spectral functions.\n", "  We derive the lowest-temperature correction to the self-energy of a spin-up\nparticle injected in a ferromagnetic background. The background is modeled with\nboth Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians so that differences due to gapless vs.\ngapped magnons can be understood. Beside the expected thermal broadening of the\nquasiparticle peak as it becomes a resonance inside a continuum, we also find\nthat spectral weight is transferred to regions lying outside this continuum. We\nexplain the origin of this spectral weight transfer and its low-temperature\nevolution.\n", "  Physicists have recently begun doing research in finance, and even though\nthis movement is less than five years old, interesting and useful contributions\nhave already emerged. This article reviews these developments in four areas,\nincluding empirical statistical properties of prices, random-process models for\nprice dynamics, agent-based modeling, and practical applications.\n", "  Since its decovery during the late 90's, the dimming of distant SN Ia\napparent luminosity has been mostly ascribed to the influence of a mysterious\ndark energy component. Based upon the cosmological \"principle\" hypothesis, this\ninterpretation has given rise to the \"concordance\" model, developed in the\ncontext of a Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmology. However, a caveat of this reasoning\nis that the cosmological \"principle\" derives from a philosophical Copernican\nassumption and has never been tested. Furthermore, a weakness of its\nconclusion, i. e., the existence of a negative-pressure fluid or a cosmological\nconstant, is that it would have profound implications for the current theories\nof physics. This is why we have proposed a more conservative explanation,\nascribing the departure of the observed universe from an Einstein-de Sitter\nmodel to the influence of inhomogeneities. This idea has been independently\ndeveloped by other authors and further enlarged to the reproduction of\ndifferent cosmological data. We review here the main proposals which has been\nmade along these lines of though and present some prospects for future\ndevelopments.\n", "  We report on the results of a study to obtain limits on the absorbing columns\nto wards an initial sample of 10 long Gamma-Ray Bursts observed with BeppoSAX,\nusing a new approach to SED fitting to nIR, optical and X-ray afterglow data,\nin count space and including the effects of metallicity. When testing MW, LMC\nand SMC extinction laws we find that SMC-like extinction provides the best fit\nin most cases. A MW-like ext inction curve is not preferred for any of these\nsources, largely since the 2175A bump, in principle detectable in all these\nafterglows, is not present in the data. We rule out an SMC-like gas-to-dust\nratio or lower value for 4 of the hosts analysed here (assuming SMC metallicity\nand extinction law) whilst the remainder of the sample have too large an error\nto discriminate. We provide an accurate estimate of the line-of-sight\nextinction, improving upon the uncertainties for the majority of the extinction\nmeasurements made in previous studies of this sample.\n", "  We consider the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking of a bulk vector\nfield to study signatures of bulk dimensions invisible to the standard model\nconfined to the brane. By assigning a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value to\nthe vector field, a direction is singled out in the bulk vacuum, thus breaking\nthe bulk Lorentz symmetry. We present the condition for induced Lorentz\nsymmetry on the brane, as phenomenologically required, noting that it is\nrelated to the value of the observed cosmological constant.\n", "  We present the results of numerical simulations of stationary, spherically\noutflowing, electron-positron pair winds, with total luminosities in the range\n10^{34}--10^{42} ergs/s. In the concrete example described here, the wind\ninjection source is a hot, bare, strange star, predicted to be a powerful\nsource of pairs created by the Coulomb barrier at the quark surface. We find\nthat photons dominate in the emerging emission, and the emerging photon\nspectrum is rather hard and differs substantially from the thermal spectrum\nexpected from a neutron star with the same luminosity. This might help\ndistinguish the putative bare strange stars from neutron stars.\n", "  It is hard to imagine curved spacetimes of General Relativity. A simple but\npowerful way how to achieve this is visualizing them via embedding diagrams of\nboth ordinary geometry and optical reference geometry. They facilitate to gain\nan intuitive insight into the gravitational field rendered into a curved\nspacetime, and to assess the influence of parameters like electric charge and\nspin of a black hole, magnetic field or cosmological constant. Optical\nreference geometry and related inertial forces and their relationship to\nembedding diagrams are particularly useful for investigation of test particles\nmotion. Embedding diagrams of static and spherically symmetric, or stationary\nand axially symmetric black-hole and naked-singularity spacetimes thus present\na useful concept for intuitive understanding of these spacetimes' nature. We\nconcentrate on general way of embedding into 3-dimensional Euclidean space, and\ngive a set of illustrative examples.\n", "  We posit that accreting compact objects, including stellar mass black holes\nand neutron stars as well as supermassive black holes, may undergo extended\nperiods of accretion during which the angular momentum of the disk at large\nscales is misaligned with that of the compact object. In such a scenario,\nLense-Thirring precession caused by the rotating compact object can\ndramatically affect the disk. In this presentation we describe results from a\nthree-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an MRI\nturbulent disk accreting onto a tilted rapidly rotating black hole. For this\ncase, the disk does not achieve the commonly described Bardeen-Petterson\nconfiguration; rather, it remains nearly planar, undergoing a slow global\nprecession. Accretion from the disk onto the hole occurs predominantly through\ntwo opposing plunging streams that start from high latitudes with respect to\nboth the black-hole and disk midplanes. This is a consequence of the\nnon-sphericity of the gravitational spacetime of the black hole.\n", "  We show some of the most important reasons why the likely fate of the merger\nof a neutron star with another compact object may be to yield a short gamma-ray\nburst (sGRB). Emphasis is made on some robust results that general relativistic\n(magneto)hydrodynamic simulations have established regarding the aforementioned\nsubject.\n", "  Chaotic dynamics essentially defines the global properties of gravitating\nsystems, including, probably, the basics of morphology of galaxies. We use the\nRicci curvature criterion to study the degree of relative chaos (exponential\ninstability) in core-halo gravitating configurations. We show the existence of\na critical core radius when the system is least chaotic, while systems with\nboth smaller and larger core radius will typically possess stronger chaotic\nproperties.\n", "  We follow the evolution of the baryonic top-hat overdensity in a single-zone\napproximation. Our goal is to juxtapose the evolution of the gas temperature in\nthe primordial clouds in the lambda cold dark matter model and the warm dark\nmatter model with keV sterile neutrinos and to check the effects of their\ndecays, into one X-ray photon and one active neutrino, on the structure\nformation. We find that, in all the cases we have examined, the overall effect\nof sterile dark matter is to facilitate the cooling of gas and to reduce the\nminimal mass of the halo able to collapse. Hence, we conclude that X-rays from\nthe decays of dark matter in the form of sterile neutrinos can help the early\ncollapse of gas clouds and the subsequent star formation.\n", "  We present here some recent results concerning scalar-tensor Dark Energy\nmodels. These models are very interesting in many respects: they allow for a\nconsistent phantom phase, the growth of matter perturbations is modified. Using\na systematic expansion of the theory at low redshifts, we relate the\npossibility to have phantom like DE to solar system constraints.\n", "  We discovered kHz QPOs in 80 archived RXTE observations from the peculiar\nlow-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Circinus X-1. In 11 cases these appear in pairs in\nthe frequency range of ~230 Hz to ~500 Hz for the upper kHz QPO and ~56 Hz to\n~225 Hz for the lower kHz QPO. Their correlation with each other, which is\nsimilar to that of frequencies of kHz QPO pairs in other LMXBs containing a\nneutron star, and their variation by a factor two confirm that the central\nobject is a neutron star. These are the lowest frequencies of kHz QPO pairs\ndiscovered so far and extend the above correlation over a frequency range of\nfactor four. In this new frequency range the frequency difference of the two\nkHz QPOs increases monotonically by more than ~170 Hz with increasing kHz QPO\nfrequency, challenging theoretical models.\n", "  We derived the evolution of the energy deposition in the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) by different decaying (or annihilating) dark matter (DM) candidates.\nHeavy annihilating DM particles (with mass larger than a few GeV) have no\ninfluence on reionization and heating, even if we assume that all the energy\nemitted by annihilations is absorbed by the IGM. In the case of lighter\nparticles, the impact on reionization and heating depends on the efficiency of\nenergy absorption by the IGM. We calculated the fraction of energy produced by\ndecays and annihilations which is effectively absorbed by the IGM. We found\nthat this fraction is generally high at very high redshift (>>100), but drops\nat more recent epochs.\n", "  We derived the influence of dark matter (DM) decays and annihilations on\nstructure formation. The energy deposited by DM decays and annihilations into\nmetal free halos both increases the gas temperature and enhances the formation\nof molecules. Within the primordial halos the temperature increase generally\ndominates over the molecular cooling, slightly delaying the collapse. In fact,\nthe critical mass for collapse is generally higher than in the unperturbed\ncase, when we consider the energy input from DM. In presence of DM decays\nand/or annihilations the fraction of baryons inside collapsed metal free halos\nshould be slightly less (~0.4) than the expected cosmological value.\n", "  Hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs) are equilibrium configurations supported\nagainst collapse by rapid differential rotation and likely form as transient\nremnants of binary neutron star mergers. Though HMNSs are dynamically stable,\nsecular effects such as viscosity or magnetic fields tend to bring HMNSs into\nuniform rotation and thus lead to collapse. We simulate the evolution of\nmagnetized HMNSs in axisymmetry using codes which solve the\nEinstein-Maxwell-MHD system of equations. We find that magnetic braking and the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) both contribute to the eventual collapse of\nHMNSs to rotating black holes surrounded by massive, hot accretion tori and\ncollimated magnetic fields. Such hot tori radiate strongly in neutrinos, and\nthe resulting neutrino-antineutrino annihilation could power short-hard GRBs.\n", "  I review the properties of degenerate fermion balls and investigate the dark\nmatter distribution at galactic centers using NFW, Moore and isothermal density\nprofiles. I show that dark matter becomes degenerate for particles masses of a\nfew keV at distances less than a few parsec from the center of our galaxy. To\nexplain the galactic center black hole of mass of $\\sim 3.5 \\times\n10^{6}M_{\\odot}$ and a supermassive black hole of $\\sim 3 \\times\n10^{9}M_{\\odot}$ at a redshift of 6.41 in SDSS quasars, the mass of the fermion\nball is assumed to be between $3 \\times 10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ and $3.5 \\times\n10^{6}M_{\\odot}$. This constrains the mass of the dark matter particle between\n$0.6 {\\rm keV}$ and $82 {\\rm keV}$. The lower limit on the dark matter mass is\nimproved to about {\\rm 6 keV} if exact solutions of Poisson's equation are used\nin the isothermal power law case. The constrained dark matter particle could be\ninterpreted as a sterile neutrino.\n", "  Dark matter has been recognized as an essential part of matter for over 70\nyears now, and many suggestions have been made, what it could be. Most of these\nideas have centered on Cold Dark Matter, particles that are predicted in\nextensions of standard particle physics, such as supersymmetry. Here we explore\nthe concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, particles that are commonly\nreferred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such particles have keV masses, and decay over\na very long time, much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce\nX-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the very early universe,\nincreasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and thus help early star\nformation. Sterile neutrinos may also help to understand the baryon-asymmetry,\nthe pulsar kicks, the early growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, as well as the shape and smoothness of dark matter halos.\nAs soon as all these tests have been made quantitative in their various\nparameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these particles, and\ncould predict the strength of the sharp X-ray emission line, expected from any\nlarge dark matter assembly. A measurement of this X-ray emission line would be\ndefinitive proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting\nneutrinos, or WINs.\n", "  We study the constraints that the detection of a non-trivial spatial topology\nmay place on the parameters of braneworld models by considering the\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) and the globally homogeneous Poincar\\'e\ndodecahedral spatial (PDS) topology as a circles-in-the-sky observable\ntopology. To this end we reanalyze the type Ia supernovae constraints on the\nparameters of the DGP model and show that PDS topology gives rise to strong and\ncomplementary constraints on the parameters of the DGP model.\n", "  We illustrate the constraints that a possible detection of a non-trivial\nspatial topology may place on the cosmological density parameters by\nconsidering the $\\Lambda$CDM model Poincar\\'e dodecahedal space (PDS) topology\nas a circles-in-the-sky detectable topology. To this end we reanalyze the type\nIa supernovae constraints on the density parameter plane\n$\\Omega_k$--$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$ and show that a circles-in-the-sky detectable\nPDS topology gives rise to important constraints on this parameters plane.\n", "  Origin of turbulence in cold accretion disks, particularly in 3D, which is\nexpected to be hydrodynamic but not magnetohydrodynamic, is a big puzzle. While\nthe flow must exhibit some turbulence in support of the transfer of mass inward\nand angular momentum outward, according to the linear perturbation theory it\nshould always be stable. We demonstrate that the 3D secondary disturbance to\nthe primarily perturbed disk which exhibits elliptical vortices into the system\nsolves the problem. This result is essentially applicable to the outer region\nof accretion disks in active galactic nuclei where the gas is significantly\ncold and neutral in charge and the magnetic Reynolds number is smaller than\n10^4.\n", "  An extension of the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos with\nmasses smaller than the electroweak scale (the $\\nu$MSM) can explain\nsimultaneously dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe, being\nconsistent with the data on neutrino oscillations. A dark matter candidate in\nthis theory is the sterile neutrino with the mass in keV range. We discuss the\nconstraints on the properties of this particle and mechanisms of their\ncosmological production. Baryon asymmetry generation in this model is reviewed.\nCrucial experiments that can confirm or rule out the $\\nu$MSM are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Heterogeneous sonochemical method was applied for synthesis of novel\nsuperconducting nanocomposites consisting of magnetic (and/or nonmagnetic)\nnanoparticles embedded into the bulk of ceramic superconductors. In addition to\nin-situ production of the efficient pinning centers, this synthesis method\nconsiderably improves the interbrain coupling. Significant enhancement of the\nmagnetic irreversibility is reported for Fe2O3 nanoparticles embedded into the\nbulk of MgB2 superconductor. Nonmagnetic Mo2O5 nanoparticles also increase\npinning strength, but less than magnetic Fe2O3. Detailed magnetization and\nelectron microscopy characterization is presented. Theory of bulk magnetic\npinning due to ferromagnetic nanoparticles of finite size embedded into the\nsuperconducting matrix is developed.\n", "  Coupling between electrical and mechanical phenomena is a near-universal\ncharacteristic of inorganic and biological systems alike, with examples ranging\nfrom ferroelectric perovskites to electromotor proteins in cellular membranes.\nUnderstanding electromechanical functionality in materials such as\nferroelectric nanocrystals, thin films, relaxor ferroelectrics, and biosystems\nrequires probing these properties on the nanometer level of individual grain,\ndomain, or protein fibril. In the last decade, Piezoresponse Force Microscopy\n(PFM) was established a powerful tool for nanoscale imaging, spectroscopy, and\nmanipulation of ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials. Here, we present\nprinciples and recent advances in PFM, including vector and frequency dependent\nimaging of piezoelectric materials, briefly review applications for\nferroelectric materials, discuss prospects for electromechanical imaging of\nlocal crystallographic and molecular orientations and disorder, and summarize\nfuture challenges and opportunities for PFM emerging in the second decade since\nits invention.\n", "  This work represents the first electro-thermal study of metallic single-wall\ncarbon nanotubes (SWNTs) for interconnect applications. Experimental data and\ncareful modeling reveal that self-heating is of significance in short (1 < L <\n10 um) nanotubes under high-bias. The low-bias resistance of micron scale SWNTs\nis also found to be affected by optical phonon absorption (a scattering\nmechanism previously neglected) above 250 K. We also explore length-dependent\nelectrical breakdown of SWNTs in ambient air. Significant self-heating in SWNT\ninterconnects can be avoided if power densities per unit length are limited to\nless than 5 uW/um.\n", "  Robustness to a wide variety of negative factors and the ability to\nself-repair is an inherent and natural characteristic of all life forms on\nearth. As opposed to nature, man-made systems are in most cases not inherently\nrobust and a significant effort has to be made in order to make them resistant\nagainst failures. This can be done in a wide variety of ways and on various\nsystem levels. In the field of digital systems, for example, techniques such as\ntriple modular redundancy (TMR) are frequently used, which results in a\nconsiderable hardware overhead. Biologically-inspired computing by means of\nbio-chemical metaphors offers alternative paradigms, which need to be explored\nand evaluated.\n  Here, we are interested to evaluate the potential of nature-inspired\nartificial chemistries and membrane systems as an alternative information\nrepresenting and processing paradigm in order to obtain robust and spatially\nextended Boolean computing systems in a distributed environment. We investigate\nconceptual approaches inspired by artificial chemistries and membrane systems\nand compare proof-of-concepts. First, we show, that elementary logical\nfunctions can be implemented. Second, we illustrate how they can be made more\nrobust and how they can be assembled to larger-scale systems. Finally, we\ndiscuss the implications for and paths to possible genuine implementations.\nCompared to the main body of work in artificial chemistries, we take a very\npragmatic and implementation-oriented approach and are interested in realizing\nBoolean computations only. The results emphasize that artificial chemistries\ncan be used to implement Boolean logic in a spatially extended and distributed\nenvironment and can also be made highly robust, but at a significant price.\n", "  Our review is devoted to three promising research lines in quantum cosmology\nand the physics of the early universe. The nonperturbative renormalization\nprogramme is making encouraging progress that we here assess from the point of\nview of cosmological applications: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian form of pure\ngravity with variable G and Lambda; power-law inflation for pure gravity; an\naccelerating universe without dark energy. In perturbative quantum cosmology,\non the other hand, diffeomorphism-invariant boundary conditions lead naturally\nto a singularity-free one-loop wave function of the universe. Last, but not\nleast, in the braneworld picture one discovers the novel concept of\ncosmological wave function of the bulk space-time. Its impact on quantum\ncosmology and singularity avoidance is still, to a large extent, unexplored.\n", "  Quasi-stationary (i.e. parametric) transitions from rotating equilibrium\nconfigurations of fluid bodies to rotating black holes are discussed. For the\nidealized model of a rotating disc of dust, analytical results derived by means\nof the \"inverse scattering method\" are available. They are generalized by\nnumerical results for rotating fluid rings with various equations of state. It\ncan be shown rigorously that a black hole limit of a fluid body in equilibrium\noccurs if and only if the gravitational mass becomes equal to twice the product\nof angular velocity and angular momentum. Therefore, any quasi-stationary route\nfrom fluid bodies to black holes passes through the extreme Kerr solution.\n", "  Paths of test particles, rotating and charged objects in brane-worlds using a\nmodified Bazanski Lagrangian are derived. We also discuss the transition to\ntheir corresponding equations in four dimensions. We then make a comparison\nbetween the given equations in brane-worlds (BW) and their analog in\nspace-time-matter (STM) theory.\n", "  The purpose of this brief report is to present some results of our on-going\nproject on the asymptotic behaviour of braneworld-type solutions on approach to\ntheir possible finite `time' singularities.\n", "  We consider Randall-Sundrum two-brane cosmological model in the low energy\ngradient expansion approximation by Kanno and Soda. It is a scalar-tensor\ntheory with a specific coupling function. We find a first integral of equations\nfor the A-brane metric and estimate constraints for the dark radiation term. We\nperform a complementary analysis of the dynamics of the scalar field (radion)\nusing phase space methods and examine convergence towards the limit of general\nrelativity. We find that it is possible to stabilize the radion at a finite\nvalue with suitable negative matter densities on the B-brane.\n", "  The Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation for eigenmodes of the radial\noscillations is determined for spherically symmetric perfect fluid\nconfigurations in spacetimes with a nonzero cosmological constant and applied\nin the cases of configurations with uniform distribution of energy density and\npolytropic spheres. It is shown that a repulsive cosmological constant rises\nthe critical adiabatic index and decreases the critical radius under which the\ndynamical instability occurs.\n", "  We discuss exotic singularities in the evolution of the universe motivated by\nthe progress of observations in cosmology. Among them there are: Big-Rip (BR),\nSudden Future Singularities (SFS), Generalized Sudden Future Singularities\n(GSFS), Finite Density Singularities (FD), type III, and type IV singularities.\nWe relate some of these singularities with higher-order characteristics of\nexpansion such as jerk and snap. We also discuss the behaviour of pointlike\nobjects and classical strings on the approach to these singularities.\n", "  I discuss the dark energy characterized by the violation of the null energy\ncondition ($\\varrho + p \\geq 0$), dubbed phantom. Amazingly, it is admitted by\nthe current astronomical data from supernovae. We discuss both classical and\nquantum cosmological models with phantom as a source of matter and present the\nphenomenon called phantom duality.\n", "  Recently some authors concluded that the energy and momentum of the Fiedman\nuniverses, flat and closed, are equal to zero locally and globally (flat\nuniverses) or only globally (closed universes). The similar conclusion was also\ndone for more general only homogeneous universes (Kasner and Bianchi type I).\nSuch conclusions originated from coordinate dependent calculations performed\nonly in comoving Cartesian coordinates by using the so-called {\\it\nenergy-momentum complexes}. By using new coordinate independent expressions on\nenergy and momentum one can show that the Friedman and more general universes\n{\\it needn't be energetic nonentity}.\n", "  A way for appending sources at the right-hand sides of the field equations of\nEinstein's unified field theory is recalled. Two exact solutions endowed with\npoint sources in equilibrium are shown, and their physical meaning is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We broaden the domain of application of the recently proposed thermal\nboundary condition of the wave function of the Universe, which has been\nsuggested as the basis of a dynamical selection principle on the landscape of\nstring solutions.\n", "  We show that under gravity the effective masses for neutrino and antineutrino\nare different which opens a possible window of neutrino-antineutrino\noscillation even if the rest masses of the corresponding eigenstates are same.\nThis is due to CPT violation and possible to demonstrate if the neutrino mass\neigenstates are expressed as a combination of neutrino and antineutrino\neigenstates, as of the neutral kaon system, with the plausible breaking of\nlepton number conservation. In early universe, in presence of various lepton\nnumber violating processes, this oscillation might lead to\nneutrino-antineutrino asymmetry which resulted baryogenesis from the B-L\nsymmetry by electro-weak sphaleron processes. On the other hand, for Majorana\nneutrinos, this oscillation is expected to affect the inner edge of neutrino\ndominated accretion disks around a compact object by influencing the neutrino\nsphere which controls the accretion dynamics, and then the related type-II\nsupernova evolution and the r-process nucleosynthesis.\n", "  We review some applications of relativistic shells that are relevant in the\ncontext of quantum gravity/quantum cosmology. Using a recently developed\napproach, the stationary states of this general relativistic system can be\ndetermined in the semiclassical approximation. We suggest that this technique\nmight be of phenomenological relevance in the context of the brane-world\nscenario and we draw a picture of the general set-up and of the possible\ndevelopments.\n", "  We show that in multidimensional gravity vector fields completely determine\nthe structure and properties of singularity. It turns out that in the presence\nof a vector field the oscillatory regime exists for any number of spatial\ndimensions and for all homogeneous models. We derive the Poincar\\'e return map\nassociated to the Kasner indexes and fix the rules according to which the\nKasner vectors rotate. In correspondence to a 4-dimensional space time, the\noscillatory regime here constructed overlap the usual\nBelinski-Khalatnikov-Liftshitz one.\n", "  We outline the covariant nature of the chaos characterizing the generic\ncosmological solution near the initial singularity. Our analysis is based on a\n\"gauge\" independent ADM-reduction of the dynamics to the physical degrees of\nfreedom, and shows that the dynamics is isomorphic point by point in space to a\nbilliard on a Lobachevsky plane. The Jacobi metric associated to the geodesic\nflow is constructed and a non-zero Lyapunov exponent is explicitly calculated.\nThe chaos covariance emerges from the independence of the form of the lapse\nfunction and the shift vector.\n", "  We refine Misner's analysis of the classical and quantum Mixmaster in the\nfully inhomogeneous picture; we both connect the quantum behavior to the\nensemble representation, both describe the precise effect of the boundary\nconditions on the structure of the quantum states.\n", "  NRGR, an Effective Field Theory approach to gravity, has emerged as a\npowerful tool to systematically compute higher order corrections in the\nPost-Newtonian expansion. Here we discuss in somehow more detail the recently\nreported new results for the spin-spin gravitational potential at third\nPost-Newtonian order.\n", "  If spacetime undergoes quantum fluctuations, an electromagnetic wavefront\nwill acquire uncertainties in direction as well as phase as it propagates\nthrough spacetime. These uncertainties can show up in interferometric\nobservations of distant quasars as a decreased fringe visibility. The Very\nLarge Telescope and Keck interferometers may be on the verge of probing\nspacetime fluctuations which, we also argue, have repercussions for cosmology,\nrequiring the existence of dark energy/matter, the critical cosmic energy\ndensity, and accelerating cosmic expansion in the present era.\n", "  The merger of two neutron stars usually produces a remnant with a mass\nsignificantly above the single (nonrotating) neutron star maximum mass. In some\ncases, the remnant will be stabilized against collapse by rapid, differential\nrotation. MHD-driven angular momentum transport eventually leads to the\ncollapse of the remnant's core, resulting in a black hole surrounded by a\nmassive accretion torus. Here we present simulations of this process. The\nplausibility of generating short duration gamma ray bursts through this\nscenario is discussed.\n", "  We present a critical analysis of the Canonical approach to quantum gravity,\nwhich relies on the ambiguity of implementing a space-time slicing on the\nquantum level. We emphasize that such a splitting procedure is consistent only\nif a real matter fluid is involved in the dynamics.\n", "  The local Lorentz group is introduced in flat space-time, where the resulting\nDirac and Yang-Mills equations are found, and then generalized to curved\nspace-time: if matter is neglected, the Lorentz connection is identified with\nthe contortion field, while, if matter is taken into account, both the Lorentz\nconnection and the spinor axial current are illustrated to contribute to the\ntorsion of space-time.\n", "  The Electroweak model will be geometrized in a 5-D Riemann-Cartan framework:\nU(1) weak hyper-charge group will be worked out in a Klauza-Klein scheme, while\nSU(2) weak isospin group will be identified to suitable bein projections of the\ncontortion field. The possibility of introducing Ashtekar formalism in 5-D\nKlauza-Klein theories will be investigated.\n", "  We solve the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics equations using\ndistributed parallel adaptive mesh refinement. We discuss strong scaling tests\nof the code, and present evolutions of Michel accretion and a TOV star.\n", "  We derive a simple algebraic criterion to select the optimal detector network\nfor a coherent wide parameter-space (all-sky) search for continuous\ngravitational waves. Optimality in this context is defined as providing the\nhighest (average) sensitivity per computing cost. This criterion is a direct\nconsequence of the properties of the multi-detector F-statistic metric, which\nhas been derived recently. Interestingly, the choice of the optimal network\nonly depends on the noise-levels and duty-cycles of the respective detectors,\nand not on the available computing power.\n", "  We introduce the Abnormally Weighting Energy (AWE) hypothesis in which dark\nenergy (DE) is presented as a consequence of the violation of the weak\nequivalence principle (WEP) at cosmological scales by some dark sector. Indeed,\nthis implies a violation of the strong equivalence principle (SEP) for ordinary\nmatter and consequent cosmic acceleration in the observable frame as well as\nvariation of the gravitational constant. The consequent DE mechanism build upon\nthe AWE hypothesis (i) does not require a violation of the strong energy\ncondition $p<-\\rho c^2/3$, (ii) assumes rather non-negligible direct couplings\nto the gravitational scalar field (iii) offers a natural convergence mechanism\ntoward general relativity (iv) accounts fairly for supernovae data from various\ncouplings and equations of state of the dark sector as well as density\nparameters very close to the ones of the concordance model $\\Lambda CDM$.\nFinally (v), this AWE mechanism typically ends up with an Einstein-de Sitter\nexpansion regime once the attractor is reached.\n", "  We present a new code for solving the coupled Einstein-hydrodynamics\nequations to evolve relativistic, self-gravitating fluids. The Einstein field\nequations are solved on one grid using pseudospectral methods, while the fluids\nare evolved on another grid by finite differencing. We discuss implementation\ndetails, such as the communication between the grids and the treatment of\nstellar surfaces, and present code tests.\n", "  A temporally discrete Schroedinger time evolution equation is proposed for\nisotropic quantum cosmology coupled to a massless scalar source. The approach\nemploys dynamically determined intrinsic time and produces the correct\nsemiclassical limit.\n", "  Measurement of accelerated expansion in the Universe led to propose a new\ncosmic fluid as its cause: dark energy. Its various incarnations offer a wealth\nof models whose relevance it is important to discriminate via contacts with\nobservations. I will present my investigations on the influence of dynamical\ndark energy models on the formation of non-linear dark matter structures. In\nparticular, I will focus on structures traced by the mass function of dark\nmatter haloes.\n", "  This is an extended summary of the two parallel sessions held at MG11: PPN1\n``Strong Gravity and Binaries'' (chaired by L.B. and L.G.) and PPN2\n``Post-Newtonian Dynamics in Binary Objects'' (chaired by G.S.). The aims and\ncontents of these sessions were close to each other and overlapping. It is\nnatural to review both sessions in one joint contribution to the MG11\nProceedings. The summary places the delivered talks in a broader perspective of\ncurrent studies in this area. One can find more details in individual\ncontributions of the respective authors.\n", "  The planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect\ngravitational wave signals from a wide range of sources. However, disentangling\nindividual signals from the source-dominated data stream is a challenging\nproblem and the focus of much current research. The problems are particularly\nacute for detection of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), for which the\ninstantaneous signal amplitude is an order of magnitude below the level of the\ninstrumental noise, and the parameter space of possible signals is too large to\npermit fully-coherent matched filtering. One possible approach is to attempt to\nidentify sources in a time-frequency spectrogram of the LISA data. This is a\ncomputationally cheap method that may be useful as a first stage in a\nhierarchical analysis. Initial results, evaluated using a significantly\nsimplified model of the LISA data stream, suggest that time-frequency\ntechniques might be able to detect the nearest few tens of EMRI events. In this\nproceedings article, we briefly outline the methods that have so far been\napplied to the problem, initial results and possible future directions for the\nresearch.\n", "  The inspirals of compact objects into massive black holes are some of the\nmost exciting of the potential sources of gravitational waves for the planned\nLaser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Observations of such extreme mass\nratio inspirals (EMRIs) will not only reveal to us the properties of black\nholes in the Universe, but will allow us to verify that the space-time\nstructure around massive compact objects agrees with the predictions of\nrelativity. Detection of EMRI signals via matched filtering and interpretation\nof the observations will require models of the gravitational waveforms. The\nextreme mass ratio allows accurate waveforms to be computed from black hole\nperturbation theory, but this is computationally expensive and has not yet been\nfully developed. Ongoing research to scope out LISA data analysis algorithms\nrequires waveforms that can be generated quickly in large numbers. To fulfil\nthis purpose, families of approximate, \"kludge\", EMRI waveforms have been\ndeveloped that capture the main features of true EMRI waveforms, but that can\nalso be generated for a comparatively small computational cost. In this\nproceedings article, we briefly outline one such waveform family (the\n\"numerical kludge\"), its accuracy and some possible ways in which it might be\nimproved in the future. Although accurate parameter extraction will require use\nof perturbative waveforms, these approximate waveforms are sufficiently\nfaithful to the true waveforms that they may be able to play a role in\ndetection of EMRIs in the LISA data.\n", "  While in general relativity black holes can be freely embedded into a\ncosmological background, the same problem in brane-worlds is much more\ncumbersome. We present here the results obtained so far in the explicit\nconstructions of such space-times. We also discuss gravitational collapse in\nthis context.\n", "  We derive the rate of change of the mean motion up to the second\npost-Newtonian order for inspiralling compact binaries with spin, mass\nquadrupole and magnetic dipole moments on eccentric orbits. We give this result\nin terms of orbital elements. We also present the related orbital phase for\ncircular orbits.\n", "  We discuss some aspects of recent research as well as more general issues\nabout motivation, useful methods and open problems in the field of cosmological\nsingularities. In particular, we review some of the approaches to the general\narea and include discussions of the method of asymptotic splittings,\nsingularity and completeness theorems and the use of the Bel-Robinson energy to\nprove completeness theorems and classify cosmological singularities.\n", "  In the present work we suggest a general covariant theory which can be used\nto study the stability of any physical system treated geometrically. Stability\nconditions are connected to the magnitude of the deviation vector. This theory\nis a modification of an earlier joint work, by the same authors, concerning\nstability. A comparison between the present work and the earlier one is given.\nThe suggested theory can be used to study the stability of planetary orbits,\nastrophysical configurations and cosmological models.\n", "  From the 'quasi-local' definition of horizons, e.g. isolated horizon and\ndynamical horizon, the consequence quasi-local energy-momentum near horizons\ncan be observed by using the idea of frame alignment. In particular, we find\nthe horizon news function from the asymptotic expansion near horizons and use\nthis to describe the gravitational flux and change of mass of a black hole.\n", "  We study the model of a massive inflaton field $\\phi$ coupled to another\nscalar filed $\\chi$ with interaction term $g^2\\phi^2\\chi^2$ for the first stage\nof preheating. We obtain the the behavior of the phase in terms of the\niteration of a simple family of circle maps. When expansion of the universe is\ntaken into account the qualitative behavior of the phase and growth number\nevolution is reminiscent of the behavior found in the case without expansion.\n", "  We show how T-duality can be implemented with brane cosmology. As a result,\nwe obtain a smooth bouncing cosmology with features similar to the ones of the\npre-Big Bang scenario. Also, by allowing T-duality transformations along the\ntime-like direction, we find a static solution that displays an interesting\nself tuning property.\n", "  We consider the noncommutative space-times with Lie-algebraic\nnoncommutativity (e.g. $\\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space). In the framework\nwith classical fields we extend the $\\star$-product in order to represent the\nnoncommutative translations in terms of commutative ones. We show the\ntranslational invariance of noncommutative bilinear action with local product\nof noncommutative fields. The quadratic noncommutativity is also briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Hawking effect can be rederived in terms of two-point functions and in\nsuch a way that it makes it possible to estimate, within the conventional\nsemiclassical theory, the contribution of ultrashort distances at $I^+$ to the\nPlanckian spectrum. Thermality is preserved for black holes with $\\kappa l_P <<\n1$. However, deviations from the Planckian spectrum can be found for mini black\nholes in TeV gravity scenarios, even before reaching the Planck phase.\n", "  We discuss 2D dilaton supergravity in the presence of boundaries. Generic\nones lead to results different from black hole horizon boundaries. In\nparticular, the respective numbers of physical degrees of freedom differ, thus\ngeneralizing the bosonic results of hep-th/0512230.\n", "  Supersymmetric black holes provide an excellent theoretical laboratory to\ntest ideas about quantum gravity in general and black hole entropy in\nparticular. When four-dimensional supergravity is interpreted as the low-energy\napproximation of ten-dimensional string theory or eleven-dimensional M-theory,\none has a microscopic description of the black hole which allows one to count\nmicrostates and to compare the result to the macroscopic (geometrical) entropy.\nRecently it has been conjectured that there is a very direct connection between\nthe partition function of the topological string and a partition function for\nsupersymmetric black holes. We review this idea and propose a modification\nwhich makes it compatible with electric-magnetic duality.\n", "  Fermat's principle applied to a flat metric in the plane yields the phase of\na Bessel function in the periodic domain for a constant index of refraction.\nGravitational forces cause the index of refraction to vary and lead to a\nmodified phase of the Bessel function. A distinction is made between the forces\nthat cause acceleration: the gravitational force affects the optical properties\nof the medium whereas the centrifugal force does not, the latter being built\ninto the phase of oscillations of the Bessel function. The time delay in radar\nechoes from planets is determined from Fermat's principle where the velocity of\nlight is the phase velocity and the index of refraction varies on account of\nthe gravitational potential. The deflection of light by a massive body is shown\nto be produced by a quadrupole interaction, and the perihelion shift requires\nboth the gravitational potential, producing a closed orbit, and the quadrupole,\ncausing the perihelion to rotate.\n", "  Accurate phase-locked 3:1 division of an optical frequency was achieved, by\nusing a continuous-wave (cw) doubly resonant optical parametric oscillator. A\nfractional frequency stability of 2*10^(-17) of the division process has been\nachieved for 100s integration time. The technique developed in this work can be\ngeneralized to the accurate phase and frequency control of any cw optical\nparametric oscillator.\n", "  The Tsallis entropy is shown to be an additive entropy of degree-q that\ninformation scientists have been using for almost forty years. Neither is it a\nunique solution to the nonadditive functional equation from which random\nentropies are derived. Notions of additivity, extensivity and homogeneity are\nclarified. The relation between mean code lengths in coding theory and various\nexpressions for average entropies is discussed.\n", "  The optical properties of LXe in the vacuum ultra violet (VUV), determining\nthe performance of a scintillation calorimeter, are discussed in detail. The\navailable data, measured in a wider spectral region from visible to UV light,\nand in a large range of Xe densities, from gas to liquid, are examined. It is\nshown that this information can be used for deriving the LXe optical properties\nin the VUV. A comparison is made with the few direct measurements in LXe for\nVUV light resulting from the LXe excitation by ionizing particles. A useful\nrelation is obtained which connects the Rayleigh scattering length to the\nrefractive index in LXe.\n", "  We present here the first direct and detailed measurements of the spatial\ndistribution of the ionizing radiation surrounding a hadron collider\nexperiment. Using data from two different exposures we measure the effect of\nadditional shielding on the radiation field around the Collider Detector at\nFermilab (CDF). Employing a simple model we parameterize the ionizing radiation\nfield surrounding the detector.\n", "  Reading and manipulating the spin status of single magnetic molecules is of\nparamount importance both for applicative and fundamental purposes. The\npossibility to combine Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) and Scanning Tunnelling\nMicroscopy (STM) has been explored one decade ago. A few experiments have\nraised the question whether or not an EPR spectrum of single molecule is\ndetachable. Only a few data have been reported in modern surface science\nliterature. To date it has yet to be proven to which extent ESR can be reliably\nand reproducibly performed on single molecules. We are setting up a new ESR-STM\n(spectrometer) to verify and study the effect of spin-spin correlations in the\nfrequency spectrum of the tunneling current which flows through a single\nmagnetic adsorbate and a metal surface. Here we discuss, the major experimental\nchallenges that we are attempting to overcome.\n", "  We recently demonstrated the value of reconstructing SPECT data with fully 3D\nMonte Carlo reconstruction (F3DMC), in terms of spatial resolution and\nquantification. This was shown on a small cubic phantom (64 projections 10 x\n10) in some idealistic configurations. The goals of the present study were to\nassess the effect of noise and modeling errors on the reliability of F3DMC, to\npropose and evaluate strategies for reducing the noise in the projector, and to\ndemonstrate the feasibility of F3DMC for a dataset with realistic dimensions. A\nsmall cubic phantom and a realistic Jaszczak phantom dataset were considered.\nProjections and projectors for both phantoms were calculated using the Monte\nCarlo simulation code GATE. Projectors with different statistics were\nconsidered and two methods for reducing noise in the projector were\ninvestigated: one based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the other\nconsisting in setting small probability values to zero. Energy and spatial\nshifts in projection sampling with respect to projector sampling were also\nintroduced to test F3DMC in realistic conditions. Experiments with the cubic\nphantom showed the importance of using simulations with high statistics for\ncalculating the projector, and the value of filtering the projector using a PCA\napproach. F3DMC was shown to be robust with respect to energy shift and small\nspatial sampling off-set between the projector and the projections. Images of\nthe Jaszczak phantom were successfully reconstructed and also showed promising\nresults in terms of spatial resolution recovery and quantitative accuracy in\nsmall structures. It is concluded that the promising results of F3DMC hold on\nrealistic data sets\n", "  A review of the research on electron and ion transport in dense rare gases is\npresented. The investigation of the transport properties of electrons in dense\nrare gases aims at understanding the dynamics and energetics of electron states\nin a dense medium and at elucidating how changes of the environment influence\ntheir nature and scattering properties. The quantum nature of electrons couples\nthem to the environment is such a way to produce a density-dependent shift of\ntheir energy that is the key to rationalize the observed phenomena.\n", "  The possibility of efficient collection and detection of vacuum ultraviolet\nlight as emitted by argon, krypton, and xenon gas is studied. Absolute quantum\nefficiencies of large area avalanche photodiodes (LAAPDs) are derived at these\nwavelengths. VUV light of wavelengths down to the 128nm of Ar emission is shown\nto be detectable with silicon avalanche photodiodes at quantum efficiencies\nabove 42%. Flexible Mylar foil overcoated with Al+MgF$_2$ is measured to have a\nspecular reflectivity of $\\sim$91% at argon emission wavelength. Low-pressure\nargon gas is shown to emit significant amounts of non-UV radiation. The average\nenergy expenditure for the creation of non-UV photons in argon gas at this\npressure is measured to be below 378 eV.\n", "  In this note, we propose, apparently for the first time, a new type of\ncontrolled nuclear fusion called \"intermediate\" because occurring at energies\nintermediate between those of the ''cold'' and ''hot'' fusions, and propose a\nspecific industrial realization. For this purpose: 1) We show that known\nlimitations of quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry and special relativity\ncause excessive departures from the conditions occurring for all controlled\nfusions; 2) We outline the covering hadronic mechanics, hadronic chemistry and\nisorelativity specifically conceived, constructed and verified during the past\ntwo decades for new cleans energies and fuels; 3) We identify seven physical\nlaws predicted by the latter disciplines that have to be verified by all\ncontrolled nuclear fusions to occur; 4) We review the industrial research\nconducted to date in the selection of the most promising engineering\nrealization as well as optimization of said seven laws; and 5) We propose with\nconstruction details a specific {\\it hadronic reactor} (patented and\ninternational patents pending), consisting of actual equipment specifically\nintended for the possible industrial production of the clean energy released by\nrepresentative cases of controlled intermediate fusions for independent\nscrutiny by interested colleagues.\n", "  In order to better understand energy estimation of electromagnetic showers in\nsegmented calorimeters, detailed Geant4 simulation studies of electromagnetic\nshowers in the energy range 1--100 GeV in CsI have been performed. When sampled\nin layers of 1.99 cm thickness, corresponding to 1.08 radiation lengths, the\nenergy fluctuations in the samples show distributions that vary significantly\nwith depth. The energy distributions are similar for incident electrons and\nphotons and were found to change systematically along the shower, varying\nlittle with the initial energy. Three probability distributions have been\nfitted to the data: negative binomial, log-normal and Gaussian distributions,\nnone of which gives a good fit over the full shower length. The obtained\nparameterizations might be useful in the use of the maximum likelihood method\nfor estimating the energy. Two methods for estimating the energy have also been\nstudied. One method is based on fitting individual longitudinal shower profiles\nwith a $\\Gamma$-function, the other one corrects the measured energy for\nleakage by utilizing the energy deposited in the last layer. Our simulations\nindicate that the last-layer correction method applied to photons and electrons\nof 1 and 10 GeV gives about a factor of 2 improvement in the energy resolution.\n", "  The results of an extensive operation of a Vacuum Spark plasma using Titanium\nelectrodes in a 120 ns 150 kA discharge are presented. The hot spots are found\nto form with a regular spacing in a zippering Z-pinch plasma, which forms close\nto the cathode and extends to approximately two thirds of the anode separation\nover a period of a few ns. The axis of the discharge is well defined by an\ninitial plasma from a Nd:YAG laser focussed onto the cathode electrode surface.\nThe statistics of the formation of the hot spots are given for the life of one\nanode electrode. Between one and three hotspots form and the favored positions\nare at 1.5 and 3.0 mm from the cathode and the strongest emission, as observed\nin a filtered X-ray pinhole camera, comes from the hot spot closest to the\ncathode. The emission spectra resolved between 50 and 350 \\AA shows a wide\nrange of Ti ionization which allows the temperatures of the anode blow off\nplasma, the Z-pinch and the hot spot plasma to be distinguished. These results\nare compared with filtered PIN diode signals and filtered pinhole images.\n", "  In a paper appearing in Annalen der Physik in 1930 Leon Rosenfeld invented\nthe first procedure for producing Hamiltonian constraints. He displayed and\ncorrectly distinguished the vanishing Hamiltonian generator of time evolution,\nand the vanishing generator of gauge transformations for general relativity\nwith Dirac electron and electrodynamic field sources. Though he did not do so,\nhad he chosen one of his tetrad fields to be normal to his spacetime foliation,\nhe would have anticipated by almost thirty years the general relativisitic\nHamiltonian first published by Paul Dirac.\n", "  We present a method to solve initial and boundary value problems using\nartificial neural networks. A trial solution of the differential equation is\nwritten as a sum of two parts. The first part satisfies the boundary (or\ninitial) conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is\nconstructed so as not to affect the boundary conditions. This part involves a\nfeedforward neural network, containing adjustable parameters (the weights).\nHence by construction the boundary conditions are satisfied and the network is\ntrained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this\napproach ranges from single ODE's, to systems of coupled ODE's and also to\nPDE's. In this article we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model\nproblems and present comparisons with finite elements for several cases of\npartial differential equations.\n", "  We show that the latest version of massively parallel processing associative\nstring processing architecture (System-V) is applicable for fast Monte Carlo\nsimulation if an effective on-processor random number generator is implemented.\nOur lagged Fibonacci generator can produce $10^8$ random numbers on a processor\nstring of 12K PE-s. The time dependent Monte Carlo algorithm of the\none-dimensional non-equilibrium kinetic Ising model performs 80 faster than the\ncorresponding serial algorithm on a 300 MHz UltraSparc.\n", "  A 3-setting Bell-type inequality enforced by the indeterminacy relation of\ncomplementary local observables is proposed as an experimental test of the\n2-qubit entanglement. The proposed inequality has an advantage of being a\nsufficient and necessary criterion of the separability. Therefore any entangled\n2-qubit state cannot escape the detection by this kind of tests. It turns out\nthat the orientation of the local testing observables plays a crucial role in\nour perfect detection of the entanglement.\n", "  We present a simple electronic circuit which provides negative group delays\nfor band-limited, base-band pulses. It is shown that large time advancement\ncomparable to the pulse width can be achieved with appropriate cascading of\nnegative-delay circuits but eventually the out-of-band gain limits the number\nof cascading. The relations to superluminality and causality are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Quantum feedback is assuming increasingly important role in quantum control\nand quantum information processing. In this work we analyze the application of\nsuch feedback techniques in eliminating decoherence in open quantum systems. In\norder to apply such system theoretic methods we first analyze the invariance\nproperties of quadratic forms which corresponds to expected value of a\nmeasurement and present conditions for decouplability of measurement outputs of\nsuch time-varying open quantum systems from environmental effects.\n", "  We study the k-pair communication problem for quantum information in networks\nof quantum channels. We consider the asymptotic rates of high fidelity quantum\ncommunication between specific sender-receiver pairs. Four scenarios of\nclassical communication assistance (none, forward, backward, and two-way) are\nconsidered. (i) We obtain outer and inner bounds of the achievable rate regions\nin the most general directed networks. (ii) For two particular networks\n(including the butterfly network) routing is proved optimal, and the free\nassisting classical communication can at best be used to modify the directions\nof quantum channels in the network. Consequently, the achievable rate regions\nare given by counting edge avoiding paths, and precise achievable rate regions\nin all four assisting scenarios can be obtained. (iii) Optimality of routing\ncan also be proved in classes of networks. The first class consists of directed\nunassisted networks in which (1) the receivers are information sinks, (2) the\nmaximum distance from senders to receivers is small, and (3) a certain type of\n4-cycles are absent, but without further constraints (such as on the number of\ncommunicating and intermediate parties). The second class consists of arbitrary\nbackward-assisted networks with 2 sender-receiver pairs. (iv) Beyond the k-pair\ncommunication problem, observations are made on quantum multicasting and a\nstatic version of network communication related to the entanglement of\nassistance.\n", "  We review recent developments in the Casimir effect which arises in\nquantization volumes restricted by material boundaries and in spaces with\nnon-Euclidean topology. The starting point of our discussion is the novel exact\nsolution for the electromagnetic Casimir force in the configuration of a\ncylinder above a plate. The related work for the scalar Casimir effect in\nsphere-plate configuration is also considered, and the application region of\nthe proximity force theorem is discussed. Next we consider new experiments on\nthe measurement of the Casimir force between metals and between metal and\nsemiconductor. The complicated problem connected with the theory of the thermal\nCasimir force between real metals is analyzed in detail. The present situation\nregarding different theoretical approaches to the resolution of this problem is\nsummarized. We conclude with new constraints on non-Newtonian gravity obtained\nusing the results of latest Casimir force measurements and compare them with\nconstraints following from the most recent gravitational experiments.\n", "  We define classical-quantum multiway channels for transmission of classical\ninformation, after recent work by Allahverdyan and Saakian. Bounds on the\ncapacity region are derived in a uniform way, which are analogous to the\nclassically known ones, simply replacing Shannon entropy with von Neumann\nentropy. For the single receiver case (multiple access channel) the exact\ncapacity region is determined. These results are applied to the case of noisy\nchannels, with arbitrary input signal states. A second issue of this work is\nthe presentation of a calculus of quantum information quantities, based on the\nalgebraic formulation of quantum theory.\n"]}
