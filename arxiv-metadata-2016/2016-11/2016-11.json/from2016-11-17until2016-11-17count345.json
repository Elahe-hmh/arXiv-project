laser pulse with a general atom, i.e., beyond the models of\nquasi-one-electron or quasi-two-electron targets, is described. The field-free\nHamiltonian and the dipole matrices are generated using a flexible $B$-spline\n$R$-matrix method. This numerical implementation enables us to construct\nterm-dependent, non-orthogonal sets of one-electron orbitals for the bound and\ncontinuum electrons. The solution of the TDSE is propagated in time using the\nArnoldi-Lanczos method, which does not require the diagonalization of any large\nmatrices. The method is illustrated by an application to the multi-photon\nexcitation and ionization of Ne atoms. Good agreement with $R$-matrix Floquet\ncalculations for the generalized cross sections for two-photon ionization is\nachieved.\n", "  In the first part of this article the various experimental sectors of physics\nin which Superluminal motions seem to appear are briefly mentioned, after a\nsketchy theoretical introduction. In particular, a panoramic view is presented\nof the experiments with evanescent waves (and/or tunneling photons), and with\nthe \"Localized superluminal Solutions\" (SLS) to the wave equation, like the\nso-called X-shaped waves. In the second part of this paper we present a series\nof new SLSs to the Maxwell equations, suitable for arbitrary frequencies and\narbitrary bandwidths: some of them being endowed with finite total energy.\nAmong the others, we set forth an infinite family of generalizations of the\nclassic X-shaped wave; and show how to deal with the case of a dispersive\nmedium. Results of this kind may find application in other fields in which an\nessential role is played by a wave-equation (like acoustics, seismology,\ngeophysics, gravitation, elementary particle physics, etc.). This e-print, in\nlarge part a review, was prepared for the special issue on \"Nontraditional\nForms of Light\" of the IEEE JSTQE (2003); and a preliminary version of it\nappeared as Report NSF-ITP-02-93 (KITP, UCSB; 2002). Further material can be\nfound in the recent e-prints arXiv:0708.1655v2 [physics.gen-ph] and\narXiv:0708.1209v1 [physics.gen-ph]. The case of the very interesting (and more\northodox, in a sense) subluminal Localized Waves, solutions to the wave\nequations, will be dealt with in a coming paper.

We use a fluid model approach to\ndescribe steady-state or transient phenomena, and apply it to the Chord system.\nFor any rate of churn and stabilization rates, and any system size, we\naccurately account for the functional form of the probability of network\ndisconnection as well as the fraction of failed or incorrect successor and\nfinger pointers. We show how we can use these quantities to predict both the\nperformance and consistency of lookups under churn. All theoretical predictions\nmatch simulation results. The analysis includes both features that are generic\nto structured overlays deploying a ring as well as Chord-specific details, and\nopens the door to a systematic comparative analysis of, at least, ring-based\nstructured overlay systems under churn.\n", "  Structure, functionality, parameters and organization of the computing Grid\nin Poland is described, mainly from the perspective of high-energy particle\nphysics community, currently its largest consumer and developer. It represents\ndistributed Tier-2 in the worldwide Grid infrastructure. It also provides\nservices and resources for data-intensive applications in other sciences.\n", "  The P326 experiment at the CERN SPS has been proposed with the purpose of\nmeasuring the branching ratio for the decay K^+ \\to \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar{\\nu} to\nwithin 10%. The photon veto system must provide a rejection factor of 10^8 for\n\\pi^0 decays. We have explored two designs for the large-angle veto detectors,\none based on scintillating tiles and the other using scintillating fibers. We\nhave constructed a prototype module based on the fiber solution and evaluated\nits performance using low-energy electron beams from the Frascati Beam-Test\nFacility. For comparison, we have also tested a tile prototype constructed for\nthe CKM experiment, as well as lead-glass modules from the OPAL electromagnetic\nbarrel calorimeter. We present results on the linearity, energy resolution, and\ntime resolution obtained with the fiber prototype, and compare the detection\nefficiency for electrons obtained with all three instruments.\n", "  Future measurements of the flavor-separated spin structure of the proton via\nparity-violating W boson production at RHIC require an upgrade of the forward\ntracking system of the STAR detector. This upgrade will allow the\nreconstruction of the charge sign of electrons and positrons produced from\ndecaying W bosons. A design based on six large area triple GEM disks using GEM\nfoils produced by Tech-Etch Inc. has emerged as a cost-effective solution to\nprovide the necessary tracking precision. We report first results from a beam\ntest of three test detectors using Tech-Etch produced GEM foils and a laser\netched two dimensional strip readout. The detectors show good operational\nstability, high efficiency and a spacial resolution of around 70 um or better,\nexceeding the requirements for the forward tracking upgrade. The influence of\nthe angle of incidence of the particles on the spatial resolution of the\ndetectors has also been studied in detail.\n", "  This paper presents the design and results of detailed tests of a CMOS active\npixel chip for charged particle detection with in-pixel charge storage for\ncorrelated double sampling and readout in rolling shutter mode at frequencies\nup to 25 MHz. This detector is developed in the framework of R&D for the Vertex\nTracker for the International Linear Collider.\n", "  Secret sharing and multiparty computation (also called \"secure function\nevaluation\") are fundamental primitives in modern cryptography, allowing a\ngroup of mutually distrustful players to perform correct, distributed\ncomputations under the sole assumption that some number of them will follow the\nprotocol honestly. This paper investigates how much trust is necessary -- that\nis, how many players must remain honest -- in order for distributed quantum\ncomputations to be possible.\n  We present a verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) protocol, and a general\nsecure multiparty quantum computation (MPQC) protocol, which can tolerate any\n(n-1)/2 (rounded down) cheaters among n players. Previous protocols for these\ntasks tolerated (n-1)/4 (rounded down) and (n-1)/6 (rounded down) cheaters,\nrespectively. The threshold we achieve is tight - even in the classical case,\n``fair'' multiparty computation is not possible if any set of n/2 players can\ncheat.\n  Our protocols rely on approximate quantum error-correcting codes, which can\ntolerate a larger fraction of errors than traditional, exact codes. We\nintroduce new families of authentication schemes and approximate codes tailored\nto the needs of our protocols, as well as new state purification techniques\nalong the lines of those used in fault-tolerant quantum circuits.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze vibration-assisted sequential tunneling (including\ncurrent-voltage characteristics and zero-frequency shot noise) through a\nmolecular quantum dot with two electronic orbitals asymmetrically coupled to\nthe internal vibration. We employ rate equations for the case of equilibrated\nphonons, and strong Coulomb blockade. We find that a system with a strongly\nphonon-coupled ground state orbital and weakly phonon-coupled excited state\norbital exhibits strong negative differential conductance; and it also shows\nsuper-Poissonian current noise. We discuss in detail the reasons and conditions\nfor the appearance of negative differential conductance.\n", "  Recently, quantum error-correcting codes were proposed that capitalize on the\nfact that many physical error models lead to a significant asymmetry between\nthe probabilities for bit flip and phase flip errors. An example for a channel\nwhich exhibits such asymmetry is the combined amplitude damping and dephasing\nchannel, where the probabilities of bit flips and phase flips can be related to\nrelaxation and dephasing time, respectively. We give systematic constructions\nof asymmetric quantum stabilizer codes that exploit this asymmetry. Our\napproach is based on a CSS construction that combines BCH and finite geometry\nLDPC codes.\n", "  Independent of the technology, it is generally expected that future nanoscale\ndevices will be built from vast numbers of densely arranged devices that\nexhibit high failure rates. Other than that, there is little consensus on what\ntype of technology and computing architecture holds most promises to go far\nbeyond today's top-down engineered silicon devices. Cellular automata (CA) have\nbeen proposed in the past as a possible class of architectures to the von\nNeumann computing architecture, which is not generally well suited for future\nparallel and fine-grained nanoscale electronics. While the top-down engineered\nsemi-conducting technology favors regular and locally interconnected\nstructures, future bottom-up self-assembled devices tend to have irregular\nstructures because of the current lack precise control over these processes. In\nthis paper, we will assess random dynamical networks, namely Random Boolean\nNetworks (RBNs) and Random Threshold Networks (RTNs), as alternative computing\narchitectures and models for future information processing devices. We will\nillustrate that--from a theoretical perspective--they offer superior properties\nover classical CA-based architectures, such as inherent robustness as the\nsystem scales up, more efficient information processing capabilities, and\nmanufacturing benefits for bottom-up designed devices, which motivates this\ninvestigation. We will present recent results on the dynamic behavior and\nrobustness of such random dynamical networks while also including manufacturing\nissues in the assessment.\n", "  We give an overview of different paradigms for control of quantum systems and\ntheir applications, illustrated with specific examples. We further discuss the\nimplications of fault-tolerance requirements for quantum process engineering\nusing optimal control, and explore the possibilities for architecture\nsimplification and effective control using a minimum number of simple switch\nactuators.\n", "  A new Lagrangian formulation with complex currents is developed and yields a\ndirect and simple method for modeling three-phase permanent-magnet and\ninduction machines. The Lagrangian is the sum a mechanical one and of a\nmagnetic one. This magnetic Lagrangian is expressed in terms of rotor angle,\ncomplex stator and rotor currents. A complexification procedure widely used in\nquantum electrodynamic is applied here in order to derive the Euler-Lagrange\nequations with complex stator and rotor currents. Such complexification process\navoids the usual separation into real and imaginary parts and simplifies\nnotably the calculations. Via simple modifications of such magnetic Lagrangians\nwe derive new dynamical models describing permanent-magnet machines with both\nsaturation and saliency, and induction machines with both magnetic saturation\nand space harmonics. For each model we also provide its Hamiltonian thus its\nmagnetic energy. This energy is also expressed with complex currents and can be\ndirectly used in Lyapunov and/or passivity based control. Further, we briefly\ninvestigate the observability of this class of Euler-Lagrange models, in the\nso-called sensorless case when the measured output is the stator current and\nthe load torque is constant but unknown. For all the dynamical models obtained\nvia such variational principles, we prove that their linear tangent systems are\nunobservable around a one-dimensional family of steady-states attached to the\nsame constant stator voltage and current. This negative result explains why\nsensorless control of three-phase electrical machines around zero stator\nfrequency remains yet a difficult control problem.\n", "  The low-field electron mobility in rectangular silicon nanowire (SiNW)\ntransistors was computed using a self-consistent Poisson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Monte\nCarlo solver. The behavior of the phonon-limited and surface-roughness-limited\ncomponents of the mobility was investigated by decreasing the wire width from\n30 nm to 8 nm, the width range capturing a crossover between two-dimensional\n(2D) and one-dimensional (1D) electron transport. The phonon-limited mobility,\nwhich characterizes transport at low and moderate transverse fields, is found\nto decrease with decreasing wire width due to an increase in the\nelectron-phonon wavefunction overlap. In contrast, the mobility at very high\ntransverse fields, which is limited by surface roughness scattering, increases\nwith decreasing wire width due to volume inversion. The importance of acoustic\nphonon confinement is also discussed briefly.\n", "  We present a security analysis of the recently introduced Quantum Private\nQuery (QPQ) protocol. It is a cheat sensitive quantum protocol to perform a\nprivate search on a classical database. It allows a user to retrieve an item\nfrom the database without revealing which item was retrieved, and at the same\ntime it ensures data privacy of the database (the information that the user can\nretrieve in a query is bounded and does not depend on the size of the\ndatabase). The security analysis is based on information-disturbance tradeoffs\nwhich show that whenever the provider tries to obtain information on the query,\nthe query (encoded into a quantum system) is disturbed so that the person\nquerying the database can detect the privacy violation.\n", "  The objective of this article is to complete preliminary results concerning\nthe time-minimal control of dissipative two-level quantum systems whose\ndynamics is governed by Lindblad equations. The extremal system is described by\na 3D-Hamiltonian depending upon three parameters. We combine geometric\ntechniques with numerical simulations to deduce the optimal solutions.\n", "  The STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at\nBrookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is in the process of designing and\nconstructing a forward tracking system based on triple GEM technology. This\nupgrade is necessary to give STAR the capability to reconstruct and identify\nthe charge sign of W bosons over an extended rapidity range through their\nleptonic decay mode into an electron (positron) and a neutrino. This will allow\na detailed study of the flavor-separated spin structure of the proton in\npolarized p + p collisions uniquely available at RHIC. The Forward GEM Tracker\nFGT will consist of six triple GEM disks with an outer radius of ~39 cm and an\ninner radius of ~10.5 cm, arranged along the beam pipe, covering the\npseudo-rapidity range from 1.0 to 2.0 over a wide range of collision vertices.\nThe GEM foils will be produced by Tech-Etch, Inc. Beam tests with test\ndetectors using 10 cm x 10 cm Tech-Etch GEM foils and a two dimensional\northogonal strip readout have demonstrated a spatial resolution of 70 um or\nbetter and high efficiency.\n", "  The field-effect mobility of graphene devices is discussed. We argue that the\ngraphene ballistic mean free path can only be extracted by taking into account\nboth, the electrical characteristics and the channel length dependent mobility.\nIn doing so we find a ballistic mean free path of 300nm at room-temperature for\na carrier concentration of ~1e12/cm2 and that a substantial series resistance\nof around 300ohmum has to be taken into account. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nfirst quantum capacitance measurements on single-layer graphene devices.\n", "  We present an {\\it ab initio} and non-perturbative time-dependent approach to\nthe problem of double ionization of a general atom driven by intense XUV laser\npulses. After using a highly flexible $B$-Spline $R$-matrix method to generate\nfield-free Hamiltonian and electric dipole matrices, the initial state is\npropagated in time using an efficient Arnoldi-Lanczos scheme. Test calculations\nfor double ionization of He by a single laser pulse yield good agreement with\nbenchmark results obtained with other methods. The method is then applied to\ntwo-color pump-probe processes, for which momentum and energy distributions of\nthe two outgoing electrons are presented.\n", "  An optical transmitter that uses entangled light generated by spontaneous\nparametric downconversion (SPDC), in conjunction with an optimal\nquantum-optical receiver (whose implementation is not yet known) is in\nprinciple capable of obtaining up to a 6 dB gain in the error-probability\nexponent over the optimum-reception un-entangled coherent-state lidar to detect\nthe presence of a far-away target subject to entanglement-breaking loss and\nnoise in the free-space link [Lloyd'08, Tan'08]. We present an explicit design\nof a structured quantum-illumination receiver, which in conjunction with the\nSPDC transmitter is shown to achieve up to a 3 dB error-exponent advantage over\nthe classical sensor. Apart from being fairly feasible for a proof-of-principle\ndemonstration, this is to our knowledge the first structured design of a\nquantum-optical sensor for target detection that outperforms the comparable\nbest classical lidar sensor appreciably in a low-brightness, lossy and noisy\noperating regime.\n", "  A feedback scheme for preparation of photon number states in a microwave\ncavity is proposed. Quantum Non Demolition (QND) measurement of the cavity\nfield provides information on its actual state. The control consists in\ninjecting into the cavity mode a microwave pulse adjusted to maximize the\npopulation of the desired target photon number. In the ideal case (perfect\ncavity and measures), we present the feedback scheme and its detailed\nconvergence proof through stochastic Lyapunov techniques based on\nsuper-martingales and other probabilistic arguments. Quantum Monte-Carlo\nsimulations performed with experimental parameters illustrate convergence and\nrobustness of such feedback scheme.\n", "  We introduce an infinite sequence of quantum channels for which the Holevo\ncapacity is additive. The channel series is closely related to the quantum\nchannels arising from universal quantum cloning machines. The additivity proof\nis motivated by a special property the studied channels enjoy: the property of\nconjugate degradability. As a consequence of the announced proof, we also\nprovide an easy way of proving the additivity of the Holevo capacity for the\noriginal Unruh channel for which the quantum capacity is already known.\nConsequently, we present not only an infinite series of finite-dimensional\nchannels but also a nontrivial example of an infinite-dimensional channel for\nwhich the classical and quantum channel capacities are easily calculable.\n", "  In this letter, we improve the results in [5] by relaxing the symmetry\nassumption and also taking the noise term into account. The author examines two\ndiscrete-time autonomous linear systems whose motivation comes from a neural\nnetwork point of view in [5]. Here, we examine the following discrete-time\nautonomous linear system: ${\\mathbf x}(k+1) = {\\mathbf A} {\\mathbf x}(k) +\n{\\mathbf b}$ where ${\\mathbf A}$ is any real square matrix with linearly\nindependent eigenvectors whose largest eigenvalue is real and its norm is\nlarger than 1, and vector ${\\mathbf b}$ is constant. Using the same \"SIR\"\n(\"Signal\"-to-\"Interference\"-Ratio) concept as in [4] and [5], we show that the\nultimate \"SIR\" is equal to $\\frac{a_{ii}}{\\lambda_{max} - a_{ii}}$, $i=1, 2,\n>..., N$, where $N$ is the number of states, $a_{ii}$ is the diagonal elements\nof matrix ${\\bf A}$, and $\\lambda_{max}$ is the (single or multiple) eigenvalue\nwith maximum norm.\n", "  We present the first experimental study of a new type of power recycling\nmicrowave interferometer designed for low noise measurements. This system\nenhances sensitivity to phase fluctuations in a Device Under Test, independent\nof input power levels. The single sideband thermal white phase noise floor of\nthe system has been lowered by 8 dB (reaching -185 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset\nfrequency) at relatively low power levels (13 dBm).\n", "  The general adversary bound is a semi-definite program (SDP) that\nlower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower\nbound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual\nSDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a\nlogarithmic factor.\n  In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on \"span programs,\" a\ncertain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that\noutputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal\n\"witness size.\" The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general\nadversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span\nprograms with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.\n  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed\nspan programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large\nclass of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for\nwhich there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been\nfound in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly,\nthe SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal\nquantum algorithm for evaluating \"balanced\" formulas over any finite boolean\ngate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the\nformula evaluation problem.\n  A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query\nalgorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although\nnearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising\nmodel for developing more quantum algorithms.\n", "  We present a fully {\\it ab initio}, non-perturbative, time-dependent approach\nto describe single and double ionization of helium by proton and antiproton\nimpact. A flexible and accurate finite-element discrete-variable-representation\nis applied to discretize the problem on the radial grid in spherical\ncoordinates. Good agreement with the most recent experimental data for absolute\nangle-integrated cross sections is obtained over a wide range of incident\nprojectile energies between 3 keV and 6 MeV. Furthermore, angle-differential\ncross sections for two-electron ejection are predicted for a proton impact\nenergy of 6 MeV. Finally, the time evaluation of the ionization process is\nportrayed by displaying the electron density as a function of the projectile\nlocation.\n", "  This two-part paper presents a new approach to predictive analysis for social\nprocesses. In Part I, we begin by identifying a class of social processes which\nare simultaneously important in applications and difficult to predict using\nexisting methods. It is shown that these processes can be modeled within a\nmulti-scale, stochastic hybrid system framework that is sociologically\nsensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. Among\nother advantages, the proposed modeling framework enables proper\ncharacterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social\nprocess (e.g., the appeal of a political movement) and the social dynamics\nwhich are its realization; this characterization is key to successful social\nprocess prediction. The utility of the modeling methodology is illustrated\nthrough a case study involving the global SARS epidemic of 2002-2003. Part II\nof the paper then leverages this modeling framework to develop a rigorous,\ncomputationally tractable approach to social process predictive analysis.\n", "  This two-part paper presents a new approach to predictive analysis for social\nprocesses. Part I identifies a class of social processes, called positive\nexternality processes, which are both important and difficult to predict, and\nintroduces a multi-scale, stochastic hybrid system modeling framework for these\nsystems. In Part II of the paper we develop a systems theory-based,\ncomputationally tractable approach to predictive analysis for these systems.\nAmong other capabilities, this analytic methodology enables assessment of\nprocess predictability, identification of measurables which have predictive\npower, discovery of reliable early indicators for events of interest, and\nrobust, scalable prediction. The potential of the proposed approach is\nillustrated through case studies involving online markets, social movements,\nand protest behavior.\n", "  A research programme is set out for developing the use of high-level methods\nfor quantum computation and information, based on the categorical formulation\nof quantum mechanics introduced by the author and Bob Coecke.\n", "  Current radiation portal monitors at sea ports and international borders that\nemploy standard radiation detection techniques are not very sensitive to\nnuclear contraband that is well shielded to absorb emanating radiation. Muon\nTomography (MT) based on the measurement of multiple scattering of atmospheric\ncosmic ray muons traversing cargo or vehicles that contain high-Z material is a\npromising passive interrogation technique for solving this problem. We report\non the design and construction of compact Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors for a\nsmall prototype MT station. This station will employ 10 tracking stations based\non 30cm x 30cm low-mass triple-GEM detectors with 2D readout. Due to the\nexcellent spatial resolution of GEMs it is sufficient to use a gap of only a\nfew cm between tracking stations. Together with the compact size of the GEM\ndetectors this allows the GEM MT station to be an order of magnitude more\ncompact than MT stations using traditional drift tubes. We present details of\nthe production and assembly of the GEM-based tracking stations in collaboration\nwith CERN and the RD51 collaboration as well as the design of the initial\nfront-end electronics and readout system.\n", "  We introduce AstroSim, a Second Life based prototype application for\nsynchronous collaborative visualization targeted at astronomers.\n", "  Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD or SSPD) are highly\npromising devices in the growing field of quantum information and\ncommunications technology. We have developed a practical SSPD system with our\nsuperconducting thin films and devices fabrication, optical coupling packaging,\nand cryogenic technology. The SSPD system consists of six-channel SSPD devices\nand a compact Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler, and can operate continuously on\n100 V ac power without the need for any cryogens. The SSPD devices were\nfabricated from high-quality niobium nitride (NbN) ultra-thin films that were\nepitaxially grown on single-crystal MgO substrates. The packaged SSPD devices\nwere temperature stabilized to 2.96 K +/- 10 mK. The system detection\nefficiency for an SSPD device with an area of 20x20 $\\mu m^2$ was found to be\n2.6% and 4.5% at wavelengths of 1550 and 1310 nm, respectively, at a dark count\nrate of 100 c/s, and a jitter of 100 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM). We\nalso performed ultra-fast BB84 quantum key distribution (QKD) field testing and\nentanglement-based QKD experiments using these SSPD devices.\n", "  We present a flexible interactive 3D morpho-kinematical modeling application\nfor astrophysics. Compared to other systems, our application reduces the\nrestrictions on the physical assumptions, data type and amount that is required\nfor a reconstruction of an object's morphology. It is one of the first publicly\navailable tools to apply interactive graphics to astrophysical modeling. The\ntool allows astrophysicists to provide a-priori knowledge about the object by\ninteractively defining 3D structural elements. By direct comparison of model\nprediction with observational data, model parameters can then be automatically\noptimized to fit the observation. The tool has already been successfully used\nin a number of astrophysical research projects.\n", "  Shannon's theory of zero-error communication is re-examined in the broader\nsetting of using one classical channel to simulate another exactly, and in the\npresence of various resources that are all classes of non-signalling\ncorrelations: Shared randomness, shared entanglement and arbitrary\nnon-signalling correlations. Specifically, when the channel being simulated is\nnoiseless, this reduces to the zero-error capacity of the channel, assisted by\nthe various classes of non-signalling correlations. When the resource channel\nis noiseless, it results in the \"reverse\" problem of simulating a noisy channel\nexactly by a noiseless one, assisted by correlations. In both cases, 'one-shot'\nseparations between the power of the different assisting correlations are\nexhibited. The most striking result of this kind is that entanglement can\nassist in zero-error communication, in stark contrast to the standard setting\nof communicaton with asymptotically vanishing error in which entanglement does\nnot help at all. In the asymptotic case, shared randomness is shown to be just\nas powerful as arbitrary non-signalling correlations for noisy channel\nsimulation, which is not true for the asymptotic zero-error capacities. For\nassistance by arbitrary non-signalling correlations, linear programming\nformulas for capacity and simulation are derived, the former being equal (for\nchannels with non-zero unassisted capacity) to the feedback-assisted zero-error\ncapacity originally derived by Shannon to upper bound the unassisted zero-error\ncapacity. Finally, a kind of reversibility between non-signalling-assisted\ncapacity and simulation is observed, mirroring the famous \"reverse Shannon\ntheorem\".\n", "  This paper empirically argues for a closer examination of what we wish to\nretain when we speak of \"retention\" in engineering [1]. We present and\ninterpret data from clinical interviews and classroom video of \"Michael,\" a\nstudent who feels marginalized by an engineering program that undervalues him\nbecause of his stance toward knowledge [2],[3]. Michael is a sophomore\nElectrical Engineering and Mathematics major in a Basic Circuits course. In his\nown words, he's a \"fringe\" student because of his robust tendency to try making\nsense of the concepts being taught rather than memorizing formulae. He also\nfeels alienated because he views learning in terms of argument and intuition,\nnot algorithm and rote acceptance. Furthermore, for Michael the practice of\nsense-making defines him; it's an integral aspect of his identity [4]. Thus,\nMichael's self-reported sense of alienation resonates strongly with existing\nidentity-based accounts of students leaving the field [5],[6]. We contend the\nfield of engineering suffers if individuals like Michael don't pursue it.\nThrough this case study of Michael, we urge the retention discussion to\nconsider not just the demographic categories of people we hope to keep, but\nalso the approaches to knowledge, learning, and problem-solving we aim to\nsupport.\n", "  A Cryogenic Sapphire Oscillator has been implemented at 11.2 GHz using a\nlow-vibration design pulse-tube cryocooler. Compared with a state-of-the-art\nliquid helium cooled CSO in the same laboratory, the square root Allan variance\nof their combined fractional frequency instability is $\\sigma_y = 1.4 \\times\n10^{-15}\\tau^{-1/2}$ for integration times $1 < \\tau < 10$ s, dominated by\nwhite frequency noise. The minimum $\\sigma_y = 5.3 \\times 10^{-16}$ for the two\noscillators was reached at $\\tau = 20$ s. Assuming equal contributions from\nboth CSOs, the single oscillator phase noise $S_{\\phi} \\approx -96 \\; dB \\;\nrad^2/Hz$ at 1 Hz offset from the carrier.\n", "  X-ray devices are far superior to optical ones for providing nanometre\nspatial and attosecond temporal resolutions. Such resolution is indispensable\nin biology, medicine, physics, material sciences, and their applications. A\nbright ultrafast coherent X-ray source is highly desirable, for example, for\nthe diffractive imaging of individual large molecules, viruses, or cells. Here\nwe demonstrate experimentally a new compact X-ray source involving high-order\nharmonics produced by a relativistic-irradiance femtosecond laser in a gas\ntarget. In our first implementation using a 9 Terawatt laser, coherent soft\nX-rays are emitted with a comb-like spectrum reaching the 'water window' range.\nThe generation mechanism is robust being based on phenomena inherent in\nrelativistic laser plasmas: self-focusing, nonlinear wave generation\naccompanied by electron density singularities, and collective radiation by a\ncompact electric charge. The formation of singularities (electron density\nspikes) is described by the elegant mathematical catastrophe theory, which\nexplains sudden changes in various complex systems, from physics to social\nsciences. The new X-ray source has advantageous scalings, as the maximum\nharmonic order is proportional to the cube of the laser amplitude enhanced by\nrelativistic self-focusing in plasma. This allows straightforward extension of\nthe coherent X-ray generation to the keV and tens of keV spectral regions. The\nimplemented X-ray source is remarkably easily accessible: the requirements for\nthe laser can be met in a university-scale laboratory, the gas jet is a\nreplenishable debris-free target, and the harmonics emanate directly from the\ngas jet without additional devices. Our results open the way to a compact\ncoherent ultrashort brilliant X-ray source with single shot and high-repetition\nrate capabilities, suitable for numerous applications and diagnostics in many\nresearch fields.\n", "  We consider the problem of distributed formation control of a large number of\nvehicles. An individual vehicle in the formation is assumed to be a fully\nactuated point mass. A distributed control law is examined: the control action\non an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative\nposition measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the\nformation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.\n  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and\ndistributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph\nis a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a\npartial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal\nevolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design\nis based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop\nstability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable\neigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to\napproach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the\nscaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the\nstructure of the information graph. We show that the scaling law can be\nimproved by employing a higher dimensional information graph.\n  Apart from analysis, the PDE model is used for a mistuning-based design of\ncontrol gains to maximize the stability margin. Mistuning here refers to small\nperturbation of control gains from their nominal symmetric values. We show that\nthe mistuned design can have a significantly better stability margin even with\na small amount of perturbation. The results of the analysis with the PDE model\nare corroborated with numerical computation of eigenvalues with the state-space\nmodel of the formation.\n", "  Fidelity is known to increase through any Kraus map: the fidelity between two\ndensity matrices is less than the fidelity between their images via a Kraus\nmap. We prove here that, in average, fidelity is also increasing for any\ndiscrete-time quantum filter: fidelity between the density matrix of the\nunderlying Markov chain and the density matrix of its associated quantum filter\nis a sub-martingale. This result is not restricted to pure states. It also\nholds true for mixed states.\n", "  A set of physics models and parameters pertaining to the simulation of proton\nenergy deposition in matter are evaluated in the energy range up to\napproximately 65 MeV, based on their implementations in the Geant4 toolkit. The\nanalysis assesses several features of the models and the impact of their\nassociated epistemic uncertainties, i.e. uncertainties due to lack of\nknowledge, on the simulation results. Possible systematic effects deriving from\nuncertainties of this kind are highlighted; their relevance in relation to the\napplication environment and different experimental requirements are discussed,\nwith emphasis on the simulation of radiotherapy set-ups. By documenting\nquantitatively the features of a wide set of simulation models and the related\nintrinsic uncertainties affecting the simulation results, this analysis\nprovides guidance regarding the use of the concerned simulation tools in\nexperimental applications; it also provides indications for further\nexperimental measurements addressing the sources of such uncertainties.\n", "  We consider nonlinear, or \"event-dependent\", sampling, i.e. such that the\nsampling instances {tk} depend on the function being sampled. The use of such\nsampling in the construction of Lebesgue's integral sums is noted and discussed\nas regards physical measurement and also possible nonlinearity of singular\nsystems. Though the limit of the sums, i.e. Lebesgue's integral, is linear with\nregard to the function being integrated, these sums are nonlinear in the sense\nof the sampling. A relevant method of frequency detection not using any clock,\nand using the nonlinear sampling, is considered. The mathematics and the\nrealization arguments essentially complete each other.\n", "  In this paper, we take a control-theoretic approach to answering some\nstandard questions in statistical mechanics, and use the results to derive\nlimitations of classical measurements. A central problem is the relation\nbetween systems which appear macroscopically dissipative but are\nmicroscopically lossless. We show that a linear system is dissipative if, and\nonly if, it can be approximated by a linear lossless system over arbitrarily\nlong time intervals. Hence lossless systems are in this sense dense in\ndissipative systems. A linear active system can be approximated by a nonlinear\nlossless system that is charged with initial energy. As a by-product, we obtain\nmechanisms explaining the Onsager relations from time-reversible lossless\napproximations, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from uncertainty in the\ninitial state of the lossless system. The results are applied to measurement\ndevices and are used to quantify limits on the so-called observer effect, also\ncalled back action, which is the impact the measurement device has on the\nobserved system. In particular, it is shown that deterministic back action can\nbe compensated by using active elements, whereas stochastic back action is\nunavoidable and depends on the temperature of the measurement device.\n", "  Triple-differential cross sections for two-photon double ionization of\nmolecular hydrogen are presented for a central photon energy of 30 eV. The\ncalculations are based on a fully {\\it ab initio}, nonperturbative, approach to\nthe time-dependent Schroedinger equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates,\ndiscretized by a finite-element discrete-variable-representation. The wave\nfunction is propagated in time for a few femtoseconds using the short,\niterative Lanczos method to study the correlated response of the two\nphotoelectrons to short, intense laser radiation. The current results often lie\nin between those of Colgan {\\it et al} [J. Phys. B {\\bf 41} (2008) 121002] and\nMorales {\\it et al} [J. Phys. B {\\bf 41} (2009) 134013]. However, we argue that\nthese individual predictions should not be compared directly to each other, but\npreferably to experimental data generated under well-defined conditions.\n", "  Muon tomography based on the measurement of multiple scattering of\natmospheric cosmic ray muons is a promising technique for detecting and imaging\nheavily shielded high-Z nuclear materials such as enriched uranium. This\ntechnique could complement standard radiation detection portals currently\ndeployed at international borders and ports, which are not very sensitive to\nheavily shielded nuclear materials. We image small targets in 3D using $2\\times\n2 \\times 2 mm^3$ voxels with a minimal muon tomography station prototype that\ntracks muons with Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors read out in 2D with\nx-y microstrips of 400 micron pitch. With preliminary electronics, the GEM\ndetectors achieve a spatial resolution of 130 microns in both dimensions. With\nthe next GEM-based prototype station we plan to probe an active volume of ~27\nliters. We present first results on reading out all 1536 microstrips of a $30\n\\times 30 cm^2$ GEM detector for the next muon tomography prototype with final\nfrontend electronics and DAQ system. This constitutes the first full-size\nimplementation of the Scalable Readout System (SRS) recently developed\nspecifically for Micropattern Gas Detectors by the RD51 collaboration. Design\nof the SRS and first performance results when reading out GEM detectors are\npresented.\n", "  Bell inequality violations correspond to behavior of entangled quantum\nsystems that cannot be simulated classically. We give two new two-player games\nwith Bell inequality violations that are stronger, fully explicit, and arguably\nsimpler than earlier work.\n  The first game is based on the Hidden Matching problem of quantum\ncommunication complexity, introduced by Bar-Yossef, Jayram, and Kerenidis. This\ngame can be won with probability~1 by a quantum strategy using a maximally\nentangled state with local dimension $n$ (e.g., $\\log n$ EPR-pairs), while we\nshow that the winning probability of any classical strategy differs from 1/2 by\nat most $O(\\log n/\\sqrt{n})$.\n  The second game is based on the integrality gap for Unique Games by Khot and\nVishnoi and the quantum rounding procedure of Kempe, Regev, and Toner. Here\n$n$-dimensional entanglement allows to win the game with probability $1/(\\log\nn)^2$, while the best winning probability without entanglement is $1/n$. This\nnear-linear ratio (\"Bell inequality violation\") is near-optimal, both in terms\nof the local dimension of the entangled state, and in terms of the number of\npossible outputs of the two players.\n", "  We have carried out calculations of the triple-differential cross section for\none-photon double ionization of molecular hydrogen for a central photon energy\nof $75$~eV, using a fully {\\it ab initio}, nonperturbative approach to solve\nthe time-dependent \\Schro equation in prolate spheroidal coordinates. The\nspatial coordinates $\\xi$ and $\\eta$ are discretized in a finite-element\ndiscrete-variable representation. The wave packet of the laser-driven\ntwo-electron system is propagated in time through an effective short iterative\nLanczos method to simulate the double ionization of the hydrogen molecule. For\nboth symmetric and asymmetric energy sharing, the present results agree to a\nsatisfactory level with most earlier predictions for the absolute magnitude and\nthe shape of the angular distributions. A notable exception, however, concerns\nthe predictions of the recent time-independent calculations based on the\nexterior complex scaling method in prolate spheroidal coordinates\n[Phys.~Rev.~A~{\\bf 82}, 023423 (2010)]. Extensive tests of the numerical\nimplementation were performed, including the effect of truncating the Neumann\nexpansion for the dielectronic interaction on the description of the initial\nbound state and the predicted cross sections. We observe that the dominant\nescape mode of the two photoelectrons dramatically depends upon the energy\nsharing. In the parallel geometry, when the ejected electrons are collected\nalong the direction of the laser polarization axis, back-to-back escape is the\ndominant channel for strongly asymmetric energy sharing, while it is completely\nforbidden if the two electrons share the excess energy equally.\n", "  Coherent feedback is a non-measurement based, hence a back-action free,\nmethod of control for quantum systems. A typical application of this control\nscheme is squeezing enhancement, a purely non-classical effect in quantum\noptics. In this paper we report its first experimental demonstration that well\nagrees with the theory taking into account time delays and losses in the\ncoherent feedback loop. The results clarify both the benefit and the limitation\nof coherent feedback control in a practical situation.\n", "  This work is concerned with applying iterative image reconstruction, based on\nconstrained total-variation minimization, to low-intensity X-ray CT systems\nthat have a high sampling rate. Such systems pose a challenge for iterative\nimage reconstruction, because a very fine image grid is needed to realize the\nresolution inherent in such scanners. These image arrays lead to\nunder-determined imaging models whose inversion is unstable and can result in\nundesirable artifacts and noise patterns. There are many possibilities to\nstabilize the imaging model, and this work proposes a method which may have an\nadvantage in terms of algorithm efficiency. The proposed method introduces\nadditional constraints in the optimization problem; these constraints set to\nzero high spatial frequency components which are beyond the sensing capability\nof the detector. The method is demonstrated with an actual CT data set and\ncompared with another method based on projection up-sampling.\n", "  Cervical Cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women worldwide.\nMost cases of cervical cancer can be prevented through screening programs aimed\nat detecting precancerous lesions. During Digital Colposcopy, Specular\nReflections (SR) appear as bright spots heavily saturated with white light.\nThese occur due to the presence of moisture on the uneven cervix surface, which\nact like mirrors reflecting light from the illumination source. Apart from\ncamouflaging the actual features, the SR also affects subsequent segmentation\nroutines and hence must be removed. Our novel technique eliminates the SR and\nmakes the colposcopic images (cervigram) ready for segmentation algorithms. The\ncervix region occupies about half of the cervigram image. Other parts of the\nimage contain irrelevant information, such as equipment, frames, text and\nnon-cervix tissues. This irrelevant information can confuse automatic\nidentification of the tissues within the cervix. The first step is, therefore,\nfocusing on the cervical borders, so that we have a geometric boundary on the\nrelevant image area. We have proposed a type of modified kmeans clustering\nalgorithm to evaluate the region of interest.\n", "  In this paper we define a discrete dynamical system that governs the\nevolution of a population of agents. From the dynamical system, a variant of\nDifferential Evolution is derived. It is then demonstrated that, under some\nassumptions on the differential mutation strategy and on the local structure of\nthe objective function, the proposed dynamical system has fixed points towards\nwhich it converges with probability one for an infinite number of generations.\nThis property is used to derive an algorithm that performs better than standard\nDifferential Evolution on some space trajectory optimization problems. The\nnovel algorithm is then extended with a guided restart procedure that further\nincreases the performance, reducing the probability of stagnation in deceptive\nlocal minima.\n", "  Global warming is affecting our Earth's environment. For example, sea level\nis rising with thermal expansion of water and fresh water input from the\nmelting of continental ice sheets due to human-induced global warming. However,\nobserving and modeling Earth's surface change has larger uncertainties in the\nchanging rate and the scale and distribution of impacts due to the lack of\ndirect measurements. Nowadays, the Earth observation from space provides a\nunique opportunity to monitor surface mass transfer and deformations related to\nclimate change, particularly the global positioning system (GPS) and the\nGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) with capability of estimating\nglobal land and ocean water mass. In this paper, the Earth's surface fluid\nvariations and deformations are derived and analyzed from global GPS and GRACE\nmeasurements. The fluids loading deformation and its interaction with Earth\nsystem, e.g., Earth Rotation, are further presented and discussed.\n", "  The ionosphere has been normally detected by traditional instruments, such as\nionosonde, scatter radars, topside sounders onboard satellites and in situ\nrocket. However, most instruments are expensive and also restricted to either\nthe bottomside ionosphere or the lower part of the topside ionosphere (usually\nlower than 800 km), such as ground based radar measurements. Nowadays, GPS\nsatellites in high altitude orbits (~20,200 km) are capable of providing\ndetails on the structure of the entire ionosphere, even the plasmasphere. In\nthis paper, a Regional Ionospheric Mapping and Tomography (RIMT) tool was\ndeveloped, which can be used to retrieve 2-D TEC and 3-D ionospheric electron\ndensity profiles using ground-based or space-borne GPS measurements. Some\nresults are presented from the RIMT tool using regional GPS networks in South\nKorea and validated using the independent ionosonde. GPS can provide\ntime-varying ionospheric profiles and information at any specified grid related\nto ionospheric activities and states, including the electron density response\nat the F2-layer peak (the NmF2) during geomagnetic storms.\n", "  Studies of community structure and evolution in large social networks require\na fast and accurate algorithm for community detection. As the size of analyzed\ncommunities grows, complexity of the community detection algorithm needs to be\nkept close to linear. The Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) has the benefits of\nnearly-linear running time and easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis\nfor efficient community detection methods. In this paper, we propose new update\nrule and label propagation criterion in LPA to improve both its computational\nefficiency and the quality of communities that it detects. The speed is\noptimized by avoiding unnecessary updates performed by the original algorithm.\nThis change reduces significantly (by order of magnitude for large networks)\nthe number of iterations that the algorithm executes. We also evaluate our\ngeneralization of the LPA update rule that takes into account, with varying\nstrength, connections to the neighborhood of a node considering a new label.\nExperiments on computer generated networks and a wide range of social networks\nshow that our new rule improves the quality of the detected communities\ncompared to those found by the original LPA. The benefit of considering\npositive neighborhood strength is pronounced especially on real-world networks\ncontaining sufficiently large fraction of nodes with high clustering\ncoefficient.\n", "  Atom interferometers allow the measurement of the acceleration of freely\nfalling atoms with respect to an experimental platform at rest on Earth's\nsurface. Such experiments have been used to test the universality of free fall\nby comparing the acceleration of the atoms to that of a classical freely\nfalling object. In a recent paper, M\\\"uller, Peters and Chu [Nature {\\bf 463},\n926-929 (2010)] argued that atom interferometers also provide a very accurate\ntest of the gravitational redshift (or universality of clock rates).\nConsidering the atom as a clock operating at the Compton frequency associated\nwith the rest mass, they claimed that the interferometer measures the\ngravitational redshift between the atom-clocks in the two paths of the\ninterferometer at different values of gravitational potentials. In the present\npaper we analyze this claim in the frame of general relativity and of different\nalternative theories, and conclude that the interpretation of atom\ninterferometers as testing the gravitational redshift at the Compton frequency\nis unsound. The present work is a summary of our extensive paper [Wolf et al.,\narXiv:1012.1194, Class. Quant. Grav. 28, 145017, (2011)], to which the reader\nis referred for more details.\n", "  Using methods from algebraic graph theory and convex optimization, we study\nthe relationship between local structural features of a network and spectral\nproperties of its Laplacian matrix. In particular, we derive expressions for\nthe so-called spectral moments of the Laplacian matrix of a network in terms of\na collection of local structural measurements. Furthermore, we propose a series\nof semidefinite programs to compute bounds on the spectral radius and the\nspectral gap of the Laplacian matrix from a truncated sequence of Laplacian\nspectral moments. Our analysis shows that the Laplacian spectral moments and\nspectral radius are strongly constrained by local structural features of the\nnetwork. On the other hand, we illustrate how local structural features are\nusually not enough to estimate the Laplacian spectral gap.\n", "  We study the stability margin of a vehicular formation with distributed\ncontrol, in which the control at each vehicle only depends on the information\nfrom its neighbors in an information graph. We consider a D-dimensional lattice\nas information graph, of which the 1-D platoon is a special case. The stability\nmargin is measured by the real part of the least stable eigenvalue of the\nclosed-loop state matrix, which quantifies the rate of decay of initial errors.\nIn [1], it was shown that with symmetric control, in which two neighbors put\nequal weight on information received from each other, the stability margin of a\n1-D vehicular platoon decays to 0 as O(1/N^2), where N is the number of\nvehicles. Moreover, a perturbation analysis was used to show that with\nvanishingly small amount of asymmetry in the control gains, the stability\nmargin scaling can be improved to O(1/N). In this paper, we show that, with\njudicious choice of non-vanishing asymmetry in control, the stability margin of\nthe closed loop can be bounded away from zero uniformly in N. Asymmetry in\ncontrol gains thus makes the control architecture highly scalable. The results\nare also generalized to D-dimensional lattice information graphs that were\nstudied in [2], and the correspondingly stronger conclusions than those derived\nin [2] are obtained. In addition, we show that the size-independent stability\nmargin can be achieved with relative position and relative velocity (RPRV)\nfeedback as well as relative position and absolute velocity (RPAV) feedback,\nwhile the analysis in [1], [2] was only for the RPAV case.\n", "  The field of weak gravitational lensing, which measures the basic properties\nof the Universe by studying the way that light from distant galaxies is\nperturbed as it travels towards us, is a very active field in astronomy. This\nshort article presents a broad overview of the field, including some of the\nimportant questions that cosmologists are trying to address, such as\nunderstanding the nature of dark energy and dark matter. To do this, there is\nan increasing feeling within the weak lensing community that other disciplines,\nsuch as computer science, machine learning, signal processing and image\nprocessing, have the expertise that would bring enormous advantage if\nchannelled into lensing studies. To illustrate this point, the article below\noutlines some of the key steps in a weak lensing analysis chain. The challenges\nare distinct at each step, but each could benefit from ideas developed in the\nsignal processing domain. This article also gives a brief overview of current\nand planned lensing experiments that will soon bring about an influx of data\nsets that are substantially larger than those analysed to date. It is,\ntherefore, inevitable that current techniques are likely to be insufficient,\nthus leading to an exciting era where new methods will become crucial for the\ncontinued success of the field.\n", "  We demonstrate that the broadband divergence of the photonic density of\nstates in hyperbolic metamaterials leads to giant increase in radiative heat\ntransfer, beyond the limit set by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The resulting\nradiative thermal \"hyper-conductivity\" may approach or even exceed heat\nconductivity via electrons and phonons in regular solids.\n", "  The CMS magnetic system consists of a super-conducting solenoid coil, 12.5 m\nlong and 6 m free bore diameter, and of an iron flux-return yoke, which\nincludes the central barrel, two end-caps and the ferromagnetic parts of the\nhadronic forward calorimeter. The magnetic flux density in the center of the\nsolenoid is 4 T. To carry out the magnetic analysis of the CMS magnetic system,\nseveral 3D models were developed to perform magnetic field and force\ncalculations using the Vector Fields code TOSCA. The analysis includes a study\nof the general field behavior, the calculation of the forces on the coil\ngenerated by small axial, radial displacements and angular tilts, the\ncalculation of the forces on the ferromagnetic parts, the calculation of the\nfringe field outside the magnetic system, and a study of the field level in the\nchimneys for the current leads and the cryogenic lines. A procedure to\nreconstruct the field inside a cylindrical volume starting from the values of\nthe magnetic flux density on the cylinder surface is considered. Special\nTOSCA-GEANT interface tools have being developed to input the calculated\nmagnetic field into the detector simulation package.\n", "  Each oscillator in a linear chain (a string) interacts with a local Ising\nspin in contact with a thermal bath. These spins evolve according to Glauber\ndynamics. Below a critical temperature, a rippled state in the string is\naccompanied by a nonzero spin polarization. The system is shown to form ripples\nin the string which, for slow spin relaxation, vibrates rapidly about\nquasi-stationary states described as snapshots of a coarse-grained stroboscopic\nmap. For moderate observation times, ripples are observed irrespective of the\nfinal thermodynamically stable state (rippled or not).\n", "  In this paper we investigate parametrization-free solutions of the problem of\nquantum pure state preparation and subspace stabilization by means of\nHamiltonian control, continuous measurement and quantum feedback, in the\npresence of a Markovian environment. In particular, we show that whenever\nsuitable dissipative effects are induced either by the unmonitored environment\nor by non Hermitian measurements, there is no need for feedback control to\naccomplish the task. Constructive necessary and sufficient conditions on the\nform of the open-loop controller can be provided in this case. When open-loop\ncontrol is not sufficient, filtering-based feedback control laws steering the\nevolution towards a target pure state are provided, which generalize those\navailable in the literature.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the competitive interaction between\nelectrical vehicles or hybrid oil-electricity vehicles in a Cournot market\nconsisting of electricity transactions to or from an underlying electricity\ndistribution network. We provide a mean field game formulation for this\ncompetition, and introduce the set of fundamental differential equations ruling\nthe behavior of the vehicles at the feedback Nash equilibrium, referred here to\nas the mean field equilibrium. This framework allows for a consistent analysis\nof the evolution of the price of electricity as well as of the instantaneous\nelectricity demand in the power grid. Simulations precisely quantify those\nparameters and suggest that significant reduction of the daily electricity peak\ndemand can be achieved by appropriate electricity pricing.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the Cs clock transition frequency in a vapor\ncell filled with Ne buffer gas has been measured. The experimental setup is\nbased on the coherent population trapping (CPT) technique and a temporal Ramsey\ninterrogation allowing a high resolution. A quadratic dependence of the\nfrequency shift is shown. The temperature of the shift cancellation is\nevaluated. The actual Ne pressure in the cell is determined from the frequency\nshift of the 895nm optical transition. We can then determine the Cs-Ne\ncollisional temperature coefficients of the clock frequency. These results can\nbe useful for vapor cell clocks and especially for future micro-clocks.\n", "  The first inversion-mode gate-all-around (GAA) III-V MOSFETs are\nexperimentally demonstrated with a high mobility In0.53Ga0.47As channel and\natomic-layer-deposited (ALD) Al2O3/WN gate stacks by a top-down approach. A\nwell-controlled InGaAs nanowire release process and a novel ALD high-k/metal\ngate process has been developed to enable the fabrication of III-V GAA MOSFETs.\nWell-behaved on-state and off-state performance has been achieved with channel\nlength (Lch) down to 50nm. A detailed scaling metrics study (S.S., DIBL, VT)\nwith Lch of 50nm - 110nm and fin width (WFin) of 30nm - 50nm are carried out,\nshowing the immunity to short channel effects with the advanced 3D structure.\nThe GAA structure has provided a viable path towards ultimate scaling of III-V\nMOSFETs.\n", "  Frictionless atom cooling in harmonic traps is formulated as a time-optimal\ncontrol problem and a synthesis of optimal controlled trajectories is obtained.\nThis work has already been used to determine the minimum time for transition\nbetween two thermal states and to show the emergence of the third law of\nclassical thermodynamics from quantum thermodynamics. It can also find\napplication in the fast adiabatic-like expansion of Bose-Einstein condensates,\nwith possible applications in atom interferometry. This paper is based on our\nrecently published article in SIAM J. Control Optim.\n", "  One of the obstacles to deployment of QKD solutions has been the distance\nlimitation. Solutions using relays have been proposed but these rely on\nlink-by-link key establishment. We present a new technique to extend the\ndistance of a quantum key distribution channel using an active relay. Each\nrelay acts as an intercept/resend device and allows the establishment of an\nend-to-end key. It has been argued that such relays cannot be used to extend\nthe distance, but we show that with a suitable adaptation of the protocol the\neffective key distribution distance can be increased.\n", "  We present a simple new technique to secure quantum key distribution relay\nnetworks using secret sharing. Previous techniques have relied on creating\ndistinct physical paths in order to create the shares. We show, however, how\nthis can be achieved on a single physical path by creating distinct logical\nchannels. The technique utilizes a random 'drop-out' scheme to ensure that an\nattacker must compromise all of the relays on the channel in order to access\nthe key.\n", "  Currently, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is the most preferred Scanning Probe\nMicroscopy (SPM) method due to its numerous advantages. However, increasing the\nscanning speed and reducing the interaction forces between the probe's tip and\nthe sample surface are still the two main challenges in AFM. To meet these\nchallenges, we take advantage of the fact that the lateral movements performed\nduring an AFM scan is a repetitive motion and propose a Repetitive Controller\n(RC) for the z-axis movements of the piezo-scanner. The RC utilizes the profile\nof the previous scan line while scanning the current line to achieve a better\nscan performance. The results of the scanning experiments performed with our\nAFM set-up show that the proposed RC significantly outperforms a conventional\nPI controller that is typically used for the same task. The scan error and the\naverage tapping forces are reduced by 66% and 58%, respectively when the scan\nspeed is increased by 7-fold.\n", "  Inspired from non-equilibrium statistical physics models, a general framework\nenabling the definition and synthesis of stationary time series with a priori\nprescribed and controlled joint distributions is constructed. Its central\nfeature consists of preserving for the joint distribution the simple product\nstruc- ture it has under independence while enabling to input con- trolled and\nprescribed dependencies amongst samples. To that end, it is based on products\nof d-dimensional matrices, whose entries consist of valid distributions. The\nstatistical properties of the thus defined time series are studied in details.\nHaving been able to recast this framework into that of Hidden Markov Models\nenabled us to obtain an efficient synthesis procedure. Pedagogical well-chosen\nexamples (time series with the same marginal distribution, same covariance\nfunction, but different joint distributions) aim at illustrating the power and\npotential of the approach and at showing how targeted statistical prop- erties\ncan be actually prescribed.\n", "  A radiation detector based on plasma display panel technology, which is the\nprincipal component of plasma television displays is presented. Plasma Panel\nSensor (PPS) technology is a variant of micropattern gas radiation detectors.\nThe PPS is conceived as an array of sealed plasma discharge gas cells which can\nbe used for fast response (O(5ns) per pixel), high spatial resolution detection\n(pixel pitch can be less than 100 micrometer) of ionizing and minimum ionizing\nparticles. The PPS is assembled from non-reactive, intrinsically radiation-hard\nmaterials: glass substrates, metal electrodes and inert gas mixtures. We report\non the PPS development program, including simulations and design and the first\nlaboratory studies which demonstrate the usage of plasma display panels in\nmeasurements of cosmic ray muons, as well as the expansion of experimental\nresults on the detection of betas from radioactive sources.\n", "  It has been shown recently that the use of two pairs of resistors with\nenhanced Johnson-noise and a Kirchhoff-loop-i.e., a Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise\n(KLJN) protocol-for secure key distribution leads to information theoretic\nsecurity levels superior to those of a quantum key distribution, including a\nnatural immunity against a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is becoming\nparticularly timely because of the recent full cracks of practical quantum\ncommunicators, as shown in numerous peer-reviewed publications. This\npresentation first briefly surveys the KLJN system and then discusses related,\nessential questions such as: what are perfect and imperfect security\ncharacteristics of key distribution, and how can these two types of securities\nbe unconditional (or information theoretical)? Finally the presentation\ncontains a live demonstration.\n", "  Real global-scale quantum communications and quantum key distribution systems\ncannot be implemented by the current fiber and free-space links. These links\nhave high attenuation, low polarization-preserving capability or extreme\nsensitivity to the environment. A potential solution to the problem is the\nspace-earth quantum channels. These channels have no absorption since the\nsignal states are propagated in empty space, however a small fraction of these\nchannels is in the atmosphere, which causes slight depolarizing effect.\nFurthermore, the relative motion of the ground station and the satellite causes\na rotation in the polarization of the quantum states. In the current approaches\nto compensate for these types of polarization errors, high computational costs\nand extra physical apparatuses are required. Here we introduce a novel approach\nwhich breaks with the traditional views of currently developed quantum-error\ncorrection schemes. The proposed quantum error-correction technique can be\napplied to fix the polarization errors which are critical in space-earth\nquantum communication systems. Moreover, the channel coding scheme provides\ncapacity-achieving communication over slightly depolarizing space-earth\nchannels.\n", "  We introduce an analytical framework to understand the path for scaling\nnanophotonic interconnects to meet the energy and footprint requirements of\nCMOS global interconnects. We derive the device requirements for sub 100\nfJ/cm/bit interconnects including tuning power, serialization-deserialization\nenergy, optical insertion losses, extinction ratio and bit error rates. Using\nCMOS with integrated nanophotonics as an example platform, we derive the\nenergy/bit, linear and areal bandwidth density of optical interconnects. We\nalso derive the targets for device performance which indicate the need for\ncontinued improvements in insertion losses (<8dB), laser efficiency,\noperational speeds (>40 Gb/s), tuning power (<100 {\\mu}W/nm),\nserialization-deserialization (< 10 fJ/bit/Operation) and necessity for\nspectrally selective devices with wavelength multiplexing (> 6 channels).\n", "  We derive a probability distribution, confidence intervals and statistics of\nthe quality (Q) factor of an arbitrarily shaped mode-stirred reverberation\nchamber, based on ensemble distributions of the idealized random cavity field\nwith assumed perfect stir efficiency. It is shown that Q exhibits a\nFisher-Snedecor F-distribution whose degrees of freedom are governed by the\nnumber of simultaneously excited cavity modes per stir state. The most probable\nvalue of Q is between a fraction 2/9 and 1 of its mean value, and between a\nfraction 4/9 and 1 of its asymptotic (composite Q) value. The arithmetic mean\nvalue is found to always exceed the values of all other theoretical metrics for\ncentrality of Q. For a rectangular cavity, we retrieve the known asymptotic Q\nin the limit of highly overmoded regime.\n", "  An automated, rapid classification of transient events detected in the modern\nsynoptic sky surveys is essential for their scientific utility and effective\nfollow-up using scarce resources. This presents some unusual challenges: the\ndata are sparse, heterogeneous and incomplete; evolving in time; and most of\nthe relevant information comes not from the data stream itself, but from a\nvariety of archival data and contextual information (spatial, temporal, and\nmulti-wavelength). We are exploring a variety of novel techniques, mostly\nBayesian, to respond to these challenges, using the ongoing CRTS sky survey as\na testbed. The current surveys are already overwhelming our ability to\neffectively follow all of the potentially interesting events, and these\nchallenges will grow by orders of magnitude over the next decade as the more\nambitious sky surveys get under way. While we focus on an application in a\nspecific domain (astrophysics), these challenges are more broadly relevant for\nevent or anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in massive data streams.\n", "  Systems that exploit publicly available user generated content such as\nTwitter messages have been successful in tracking seasonal influenza. We\ndeveloped a novel filtering method for Influenza-Like-Illnesses (ILI)-related\nmessages using 587 million messages from Twitter micro-blogs. We first filtered\nmessages based on syndrome keywords from the BioCaster Ontology, an extant\nknowledge model of laymen's terms. We then filtered the messages according to\nsemantic features such as negation, hashtags, emoticons, humor and geography.\nThe data covered 36 weeks for the US 2009 influenza season from 30th August\n2009 to 8th May 2010. Results showed that our system achieved the highest\nPearson correlation coefficient of 98.46% (p-value<2.2e-16), an improvement of\n3.98% over the previous state-of-the-art method. The results indicate that\nsimple NLP-based enhancements to existing approaches to mine Twitter data can\nincrease the value of this inexpensive resource.\n", "  The readout electronics of the ATLAS Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter will have to\nwithstand the about ten times larger radiation environment of the future\nhigh-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) compared to their design values. The GaAs ASIC\nwhich comprises the heart of the readout electronics has been exposed to\nneutron and proton radiation with fluences up to ten times the total expected\nfluences for ten years of running of the HL-LHC. Neutron tests were performed\nat the NPI in Rez, Czech Republic, where a 36 MeV proton beam is directed on a\nthick heavy water target to produce neutrons. The proton irradiation was done\nwith 200 MeV protons at the PROSCAN area of the Proton Irradiation Facility at\nthe PSI in Villigen, Switzerland. In-situ measurements of S-parameters in both\ntests allow the evaluation of frequency dependent performance parameters - like\ngain and input impedance - as a function of the fluence. The linearity of the\nASIC response has been measured directly in the neutron tests with a triangular\ninput pulse of varying amplitude. The performance measurements and expected\nperformance degradations under HL-LHC conditions are presented.\n", "  The plasma panel sensor (PPS) is an inherently digital, high gain, novel\nvariant of micropattern gas detectors inspired by many operational and\nfabrication principles common to plasma display panels (PDPs). The PPS is\ncomprised of a dense array of small, plasma discharge, gas cells within a\nhermetically-sealed glass panel, and is assembled from non-reactive,\nintrinsically radiation-hard materials such as glass substrates, metal\nelectrodes and mostly inert gas mixtures. We are developing the technology to\nfabricate these devices with very low mass and small thickness, using gas gaps\nof at least a few hundred micrometers. Our tests with these devices demonstrate\na spatial resolution of about 1 mm. We intend to make PPS devices with much\nsmaller cells and the potential for much finer position resolutions. Our PPS\ntests also show response times of several nanoseconds. We report here our\nresults in detecting betas, cosmic-ray muons, and our first proton beam tests.\n", "  Suppose that a polynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit, described as a\nsequence of local unitary interactions followed by a partial trace, generates a\nquantum state shared between two parties. One might then wonder, does this\nquantum circuit produce a state that is separable or entangled? Here, we give\nevidence that it is computationally hard to decide the answer to this question,\neven if one has access to the power of quantum computation. We begin by\nexhibiting a two-message quantum interactive proof system that can decide the\nanswer to a promise version of the question. We then prove that the promise\nproblem is hard for the class of promise problems with \"quantum statistical\nzero knowledge\" (QSZK) proof systems by demonstrating a polynomial-time Karp\nreduction from the QSZK-complete promise problem \"quantum state\ndistinguishability\" to our quantum separability problem. By exploiting Knill's\nefficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a\ncircuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard\nwith respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as\nphrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a\ntwo-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and\nQSZK. We also consider a variant of the problem, in which a given\npolynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit accepts a quantum state as input,\nand the question is to decide if there is an input to this circuit which makes\nits output separable across some bipartite cut. We prove that this problem is a\ncomplete promise problem for the class QIP of problems decidable by quantum\ninteractive proof systems. Finally, we show that a two-message quantum\ninteractive proof system can also decide a multipartite generalization of the\nquantum separability problem.\n", "  The International AXion Observatory (IAXO) will incorporate a new generation\ndetector for axions, a hypothetical particle, which was postulated to solve one\nof the puzzles arising in the standard model of particle physics, namely the\nstrong CP problem. The new IAXO experiment is aiming at achieving a sensitivity\nto the coupling between axions and photons of one order of magnitude beyond the\nlimits of the current state-of-the-art detector, represented by the CERN Axion\nSolar Telescope (CAST). The IAXO detector relies on a high-magnetic field\ndistributed over a very large volume to convert solar axions into x-ray\nphotons. Utilizing the designs of the ATLAS barrel and end-cap toroids, a large\nsuperconducting toroidal magnet is currently being designed at CERN to provide\nthe required magnetic field. The new toroid will be built up from eight, one\nmeter wide and 20 m long, racetrack coils. The toroid is sized about 4 m in\ndiameter and 22 m in length. It is designed to realize a peak magnetic field of\n5.4 T with a stored energy of 500 MJ. The magnetic field optimization process\nto arrive at maximum detector yield is described. In addition, force and stress\ncalculations are performed to select materials and determine their structure\nand sizing. Conductor dimensionality, quench protection and the cryogenic\ndesign are dealt with as well.\n", "  Several new families of multi-memory classical convolutional\nBose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes as well as families of unit-memory\nquantum convolutional codes are constructed in this paper. Our unit-memory\nclassical and quantum convolutional codes are optimal in the sense that they\nattain the classical (quantum) generalized Singleton bound. The constructions\npresented in this paper are performed algebraically and not by computational\nsearch.\n", "  Four quantum code constructions generating several new families of good\nnonbinary quantum nonprimitive non-narrow-sense Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem\n(BCH) codes are presented in this paper. The first two ones are based on\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) construction derived from two nonprimitive BCH\ncodes, not necessarily self-orthogonal. The third one is based on nonbinary\nSteane's enlargement of CSS codes applied to suitable sub-families of\nnonprimitive non-narrow-sense BCH codes. The fourth construction is derived\nfrom suitable sub-families of Hermitian self-orthogonal nonprimitive\nnon-narrow-sense BCH codes. These constructions generate new families of\nquantum BCH codes whose parameters are better than the ones available in the\nliterature.\n", "  For high-speed quantum key distribution systems, error reconciliation is\noften the bottleneck affecting system performance. By exchanging common\ninformation through a public channel, the identical key can be generated on\nboth communicating sides. However, the necessity to eliminate disclosed bits\nfor security reasons lowers the final key rate. To improve this key rate, the\namount of disclosed bits should be minimized. In addition, decreasing the time\nspent on error reconciliation also improves the key rate. In this paper we\nintroduce a practical method for expeditious error reconciliation implemented\nin a Field Programmable Gate Array for a discrete variable quantum key\ndistribution system, and illustrate the superiority of this method to other\nsimilar algorithms running on a PC. Experimental results demonstrate the\nrapidity of the proposed protocol.\n", "  Bi-2212 round wire is made by the powder-in-tube technique. An unavoidable\nproperty of powder-in-tube conductors is that there is about 30% void space in\nthe as-drawn wire. We have recently shown that the gas present in the as-drawn\nBi-2212 wire agglomerates into large bubbles and that they are presently the\nmost deleterious current limiting mechanism. By densifying short 2212 wires\nbefore reaction through cold isostatic pressing (CIPping), the void space was\nalmost removed and the gas bubble density was reduced significantly, resulting\nin a doubled engineering critical current density (JE) of 810 A/mm2 at 5 T, 4.2\nK. Here we report on densifying Bi-2212 wire by swaging, which increased JE\n(4.2 K, 5 T) from 486 A/mm2 for as-drawn wire to 808 A/mm2 for swaged wire.\nThis result further confirms that enhancing the filament packing density is of\ngreat importance for making major JE improvement in this round-wire magnet\nconductor.\n", "  Topological quantum computing has recently proven itself to be a very\npowerful model when considering large- scale, fully error corrected quantum\narchitectures. In addition to its robust nature under hardware errors, it is a\nsoftware driven method of error corrected computation, with the hardware\nresponsible for only creating a generic quantum resource (the topological\nlattice). Computation in this scheme is achieved by the geometric manipulation\nof holes (defects) within the lattice. Interactions between logical qubits\n(quantum gate operations) are implemented by using particular arrangements of\nthe defects, such as braids and junctions. We demonstrate that junction-based\ntopological quantum gates allow highly regular and structured implementation of\nlarge CNOT (controlled-not) gate networks, which ultimately form the basis of\nthe error corrected primitives that must be used for an error corrected\nalgorithm. We present a number of heuristics to optimise the area of the\nresulting structures and therefore the number of the required hardware\nresources.\n", "  We establish a link between Fourier optics and a recent construction from the\nmachine learning community termed the kernel mean map. Using the Fraunhofer\napproximation, it identifies the kernel with the squared Fourier transform of\nthe aperture. This allows us to use results about the invertibility of the\nkernel mean map to provide a statement about the invertibility of Fraunhofer\ndiffraction, showing that imaging processes with arbitrarily small apertures\ncan in principle be invertible, i.e., do not lose information, provided the\nobjects to be imaged satisfy a generic condition. A real world experiment shows\nthat we can super-resolve beyond the Rayleigh limit.\n", "  We propose a novel algorithm for selection of dangerous N-2 contingencies\nassociated with line or generator failures. The algorithm is based on iterative\nfiltering of the set of all possible double contingencies. It is certified to\nidentify all the dangerous contingencies, and has the complexity comparable to\nthe N-1 contingency screening. Tests performed on realistic model of Polish\npower grid with about 3000 buses show that only two iterations of algorithm\nallow one to certify the safety of 99.9% of all double contingencies, leaving\nonly 0.1% of the most dangerous ones for direct analysis.\n", "  Time projection chambers (TPCs) have found a wide range of applications in\nparticle physics, nuclear physics, and homeland security. For TPCs with\nhigh-resolution readout, the readout electronics often dominate the price of\nthe final detector. We have developed a novel method which could be used to\nbuild large-scale detectors while limiting the necessary readout area. By\nfocusing the drift charge with static electric fields, we would allow a small\narea of electronics to be sensitive to particle detection for a much larger\ndetector volume. The resulting cost reduction could be important in areas of\nresearch which demand large-scale detectors, including dark matter searches and\ndetection of special nuclear material. We present simulations made using the\nsoftware package Garfield of a focusing structure to be used with a prototype\nTPC with pixel readout. This design should enable significant focusing while\nretaining directional sensitivity to incoming particles. We also present first\nexperimental results and compare them with simulation.\n", "  Partitioned-interval detection binary quantum receiver with non-ideal devices\nis theoretically analyzed. Using global optimized partition strategy,\nrelatively large gain over standard quantum limit (SQL) is obtained with small\npartition number for certain mean photon number.\n", "  An increasing portion of modern socializing takes place via online social\nnetworks. Members of these communities often play distinct roles that can be\ndeduced from observations of users' online activities. One such activity is the\nsharing of multimedia, the popularity of which can vary dramatically. Here we\ndiscuss our initial analysis of anonymized, scraped data from consenting\nFacebook users, together with associated demographic and psychological\nprofiles. We present five clusters of users with common observed online\nbehaviors, where these users also show correlated profile characteristics.\nFinally, we identify some common properties of the most popular multimedia\ncontent.\n", "  Information propagation in social media depends not only on the static\nfollower structure but also on the topic-specific user behavior. Hence novel\nmodels incorporating dynamic user behavior are needed. To this end, we propose\na model for individual social media users, termed a genotype. The genotype is a\nper-topic summary of a user's interest, activity and susceptibility to adopt\nnew information. We demonstrate that user genotypes remain invariant within a\ntopic by adopting them for classification of new information spread in\nlarge-scale real networks. Furthermore, we extract topic-specific influence\nbackbone structures based on information adoption and show that they differ\nsignificantly from the static follower network. When employed for influence\nprediction of new content spread, our genotype model and influence backbones\nenable more than $20% improvement, compared to purely structural features. We\nalso demonstrate that knowledge of user genotypes and influence backbones allow\nfor the design of effective strategies for latency minimization of\ntopic-specific information spread.\n", "  The domain of radio astronomy is currently facing significant computational\nchallenges, foremost amongst which are those posed by the development of the\nworld's largest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Preliminary\nspecifications for this instrument suggest that the final design will\nincorporate between 2000 and 3000 individual 15 metre receiving dishes, which\ntogether can be expected to produce a data rate of many TB/s. Given such a high\ndata rate, it becomes crucial to consider how this information will be\nprocessed and stored to maximise its scientific utility. In this paper, we\nconsider one possible data processing scenario for the SKA, for the purposes of\nan all-sky pulsar survey. In particular we treat the selection of promising\nsignals from the SKA processing pipeline as a data stream classification\nproblem. We consider the feasibility of classifying signals that arrive via an\nunlabelled and heavily class imbalanced data stream, using currently available\nalgorithms and frameworks. Our results indicate that existing stream learners\nexhibit unacceptably low recall on real astronomical data when used in standard\nconfiguration; however, good false positive performance and comparable accuracy\nto static learners, suggests they have definite potential as an on-line\nsolution to this particular big data challenge.\n", "  This paper describes results from a project in an undergraduate engineering\nphysics course that coupled classroom use of interactive computer simulations\nwith the collection of real-time formative assessment using pen-enabled mobile\ntechnology. Interactive simulations (free or textbook-based) are widely used\nacross the undergraduate science and engineering curriculia to help actively\nengaged students increase their understanding of abstract concepts or phenomena\nwhich are not directly or easily observable. However, there are indications in\nthe literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices\nassociated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student\nuse of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative\nassessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The\nresearch question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with\nthis coupled model greater for certain types of learners in undergraduate STEM\nclassrooms? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning\nstyles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by\nFelder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use\ninteractive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of\nthis pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about\nmodification of instruction to address various learning styles.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of robust stability for a class of uncertain\nnonlinear quantum systems subject to unknown perturbations in the system\nHamiltonian. The nominal system is a linear quantum system defined by a linear\nvector of coupling operators and a quadratic Hamiltonian. This paper extends\nprevious results on the robust stability of nonlinear quantum systems to allow\nfor quantum systems with dynamic uncertainties. These dynamic uncertainties are\nrequired to satisfy a certain quantum stochastic integral quadratic constraint.\nThe robust stability condition is given in terms of a strict bounded real\ncondition. This result is applied to the robust stability analysis of an\noptical parametric amplifier.\n", "  We study the problem of containing spreading processes in arbitrary directed\nnetworks by distributing protection resources throughout the nodes of the\nnetwork. We consider two types of protection resources are available: (i)\nPreventive resources able to defend nodes against the spreading (such as\nvaccines in a viral infection process), and (ii) corrective resources able to\nneutralize the spreading after it has reached a node (such as antidotes). We\nassume that both preventive and corrective resources have an associated cost\nand study the problem of finding the cost-optimal distribution of resources\nthroughout the nodes of the network. We analyze these questions in the context\nof viral spreading processes in directed networks. We study the following two\nproblems: (i) Given a fixed budget, find the optimal allocation of preventive\nand corrective resources in the network to achieve the highest level of\ncontainment, and (ii) when a budget is not specified, find the minimum budget\nrequired to control the spreading process. We show that both resource\nallocation problems can be solved in polynomial time using Geometric\nProgramming (GP) for arbitrary directed graphs of nonidentical nodes and a wide\nclass of cost functions. Furthermore, our approach allows to optimize\nsimultaneously over both preventive and corrective resources, even in the case\nof cost functions being node-dependent. We illustrate our approach by designing\noptimal protection strategies to contain an epidemic outbreak that propagates\nthrough an air transportation network.\n", "  Optoacoustic tomography (OAT), also known as photoacoustic tomography, is an\nemerging computed biomedical imaging modality that exploits optical contrast\nand ultrasonic detection principles. Iterative image reconstruction algorithms\nthat are based on discrete imaging models are actively being developed for OAT\ndue to their ability to improve image quality by incorporating accurate models\nof the imaging physics, instrument response, and measurement noise. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of discrete imaging models based on Kaiser-Bessel\nwindow functions for iterative image reconstruction in OAT. A closed-form\nexpression for the pressure produced by a Kaiser-Bessel function is calculated,\nwhich facilitates accurate computation of the system matrix.\nComputer-simulation and experimental studies are employed to demonstrate the\npotential advantages of Kaiser-Bessel function-based iterative image\nreconstruction in OAT.\n", "  As computers approach the physical limits of information storable in memory,\nnew methods will be needed to further improve information storage and\nretrieval. We propose a quantum inspired vector based approach, which offers a\ncontextually dependent mapping from the subsymbolic to the symbolic\nrepresentations of information. If implemented computationally, this approach\nwould provide exceptionally high density of information storage, without the\ntraditionally required physical increase in storage capacity. The approach is\ninspired by the structure of human memory and incorporates elements of\nGardenfors' Conceptual Space approach and Humphreys et al.'s matrix model of\nmemory.\n", "  This paper presents a design for scaleable space solar power systems based on\nfree-flying reflectors and module self-assembly. Lower system cost of\nutility-scale space solar power is achieved by design independence of\nyet-to-be-built in-space assembly or transportation infrastructure. Using\ncurrent and expected near-term technology, this study describe a design for\nmid-term utility-scale power plants in geosynchronous orbits. High-level\neconomic considerations in the context of current and expected future launch\ncosts are given as well.\n  \\c{opyright} 2013 IEEE.

To perform a numerical\nanalysis, we use the Quantum Resource Estimator Toolbox (QuRE) that we recently\ndeveloped. We use QuRE to estimate the number of qubits, quantum gates, and\namount of time needed to factor a 1024-bit number on several candidate quantum\ntechnologies that differ in their clock speed and reliability. We make several\ninteresting observations. First, topological quantum error correction requires\nfewer resources when physical gate error rates are high, white concatenated\ncodes have smaller overhead for physical gate error rates below approximately\n10E-7. Consequently, we show that different error-correcting codes should be\nchosen for two of the studied physical quantum technologies - ion traps and\nsuperconducting qubits. Second, we observe that the composition of the\nelementary gate types occurring in a typical logical circuit, a fault-tolerant\ncircuit protected by the surface code, and a fault-tolerant circuit protected\nby a concatenated code all differ. This also suggests that choosing the most\nappropriate error correction technique depends on the ability of the future\ntechnology to perform specific gates efficiently.\n", "  Deformation twinning is generally considered to be the primary mechanism for\nhexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals due to their limited slip systems. Recent\nmicrocompression experiments on hcp metals point to intriguing strong size\neffects on twinning mechanisms, indicating that pyramidal slips dominate\ncompression.In this work we analyze size effects on twinning due to\nlattice-rotation strain in hcp single crystals. A criterion for deformation\ntwinning is derived at the nanoscale and tested by molecular dynamics\nsimulations of magnesium and titanium single crystals. The results show <c+a>\npyramidal slip dominates the compression deformation at the nanoscale,\nconsistent with experimental observations as well as our analysis. Our finding\nclarifies the nature of size effects in deformation twinning, while also\nproviding an explanation for the so-called strength differential (SD) effect.\n", "  In the most common space solar power (SSP) system architectures, solar energy\nharvested by large satellites in geostationary orbit is transmitted to Earth\nvia microwave radiation. Currently, only limited information about the\ninteractions of microwave beams with energy densities of several tens to\nhundreds of W/m$^2$ with the different layers of the atmosphere is available.\nGovernmental bodies will likely require detailed investigations of safety and\natmospheric effects of microwave power beams before issuing launch licenses for\nSSP satellite systems. This paper proposes to collect representative and\ncomprehensive data of the interaction of power beams with the atmosphere by\nextending the infrastructure of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research\nProgram (HAARP) facility in Alaska, USA. Estimates of the transmission\ninfrastructure performance as well as measurement devices and scientific\ncapabilities of possible upgrade scenarios will be discussed. The proposed\nupgrade of the HAARP facility is expected to deliver a wealth of data and\ninformation which could serve as a decision base for governmental launch\nlicensing of SSP satellites, and which can be used in addition to deepen public\nacceptance of SSP as a large-scale renewable energy source.\n  Copyright 2014 IEEE.

We consider small enough temperature jumps, for which a\nlinear response theory has been recently derived. Within this theory, the\nKovacs hump is directly related to the monotonic relaxation function of the\nenergy. The analytical results are compared with extensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations, and an excellent agreement is found. Remarkably, the position of\nthe maximum in the Kovacs hump depends on the fact that the true asymptotic\nbehavior of the relaxation function is different from the stretched exponential\ndescribing the relevant part of the relaxation at low temperatures.\n", "  In recent years there have been many improvements in the reliability of\ncritical infrastructure systems. Despite these improvements, the power systems\nindustry has seen relatively small advances in this regard. For instance, power\nquality deficiencies, a high number of localized contingencies, and large\ncascading outages are still too widespread. Though progress has been made in\nimproving generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure, remedial\naction schemes (RAS) remain non-standardized and are often not uniformly\nimplemented across different utilities, ISOs, and RTOs. Traditionally, load\nshedding and islanding have been successful protection measures in restraining\npropagation of contingencies and large cascading outages. This paper proposes a\nnovel, algorithmic approach to selecting RAS policies to optimize the operation\nof the power network during and after a contingency. Specifically, we use\npolicy-switching to consolidate traditional load shedding and islanding\nschemes. In order to model and simulate the functionality of the proposed power\nsystems protection algorithm, we conduct Monte-Carlo, time-domain simulations\nusing Siemens PSS/E. The algorithm is tested via experiments on the IEEE-39\ntopology to demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves optimal power\nsystem performance during emergency situations, given a specific set of RAS\npolicies.\n", "  We report on balanced SIS receivers covering the astronomical important\n180-720 GHz submillimeter atmospheric window. To facilitate remote observations\nand automated spectral line surveys, fully synthesized local oscillators are\nemployed. High-current-density Nb-AlN-Nb\nsuperconducting-insulating-superconducting (SIS) tunnel junctions are used as\nthe mixing element. The measured double-sideband (DSB) 230 GHz receiver noise\ntemperature, uncorrected for optics loss, ranges from 50K at 185 GHz, 33K at\n246 GHz, to 51K at 280 GHz. In this frequency range the mixer has a DSB\nconversion gain of 0 +- 1.5 dB. The measured 460 GHz double-sideband receiver\nnoise temperature, uncorrected for optics loss, is 32K at 400 GHz, 34K at 460\nGHz, and 61K at 520 GHz. Similar to the 230 GHz balanced mixer, the DSB mixer\nconversion gain is 1 +- 1 dB. To help optimize performance, the mixer IF\ncircuits and bias injection are entirely planar by design. Dual-frequency\nobservation, by means of separating the incoming circular polarized electric\nfield into two orthogonal components, is another important mode of operation\noffered by the new facility instrumentation. Instrumental stability is\nexcellent supporting the LO noise cancellation properties of the balanced mixer\nconfiguration. In the spring of 2012 the dual-frequency 230/460 SIS receiver\nwas successfully installed at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), Mauna\nKea, HI.\n", "  Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) tries to mimic the computing in\ncerebral-neocortex. It identifies spatial and temporal patterns in the input\nfor making inferences. This may require large number of computationally\nexpensive tasks like, dot-product evaluations. Nano-devices that can provide\ndirect mapping for such primitives are of great interest. In this work we show\nthat the computing blocks for HTM can be mapped using low-voltage,\nfast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons combined with emerging resistive\ncross-bar network (RCN). Results show possibility of more than 200x lower\nenergy as compared to 45nm CMOS ASIC design\n", "  The near-field acoustic scattering from a sphere centered on the axis of a\nfinite Bessel acoustic beam is derived stemming from the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld\ndiffraction surface integral and the addition theorems for the spherical wave\nand Legendre functions. The beam emerges from a finite circular disk vibrating\naccording to one of its radial modes corresponding to the fundamental solution\nof a Bessel beam J0. The incident pressure field's expression is derived\nanalytically as a partial-wave series expansion taking into account the finite\nsize and the distance from the center of the disk transducer. Initially, the\nscattered pressure by a rigid sphere is evaluated, and backscattering pressure\nmoduli plots as well as 3-D directivity patterns for an elastic PMMA sphere\ncentered on a finite Bessel beam with appropriate tuning of its half-cone\nangle, reveal possible resonance suppression of the sphere only in the zone\nnear the Bessel transducer. Moreover, the analysis is extended to derive the\nmean spatial incident and scattered pressures at the surface of a rigid\ncircular receiver of infinitesimal thickness. The transducer, sphere and\nreceiver are assumed to be coaxial. Some applications can result from the\npresent analysis since all physically realizable Bessel beam sources radiate\nfinite sound beams as opposed to waves of infinite extent.\n", "  While memory effects have been reported for dense enough disordered systems\nsuch as glasses, we show here by a combination of analytical and simulation\ntechniques that they are also intrinsic to the dynamics of dilute granular\ngases. By means of a certain driving protocol, we prepare the gas in a state\nwhere the granular temperature $T$ coincides with its long time limit. However,\n$T$ does not subsequently remain constant, but exhibits a non-monotonic\nevolution before reaching its non-equilibrium steady value. The corresponding\nso-called Kovacs hump displays a normal behavior for weak dissipation (as\nobserved in molecular systems), but is reversed under strong dissipation, where\nit thus becomes anomalous.\n", "  We introduce one-way LOCC protocols for quantum state merging for compound\nsources, which have asymptotically optimal entanglement as well as classical\ncommunication resource costs. For the arbitrarily varying quantum source (AVQS)\nmodel, we determine the one-way entanglement distillation capacity, where we\nutilize the robustification and elimination techniques, well-known from\nclassical as well as quantum channel coding under assumption of arbitrarily\nvarying noise. Investigating quantum state merging for AVQS, we demonstrate by\nexample, that the usual robustification procedure leads to suboptimal resource\ncosts in this case.\n", "  To accurately calculate efficiencies $\\eta$ of experimentally produced\nmultijunction solar cells (MJSCs) and optimize their parameters, we offer\nsemi-analytical photoconversion formalism that incorporates radiative\nrecombination, Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination, surface recombination at\nthe front and back surfaces of the cells, recombination in the space charge\nregion (SCR) and the recombination at the heterojunction boundaries.\nSelfconsistent balance between the MJSC temperature and efficiency was imposed\nby jointly solving the equations for the photocurrent, photovoltage, and heat\nbalance. Finally, we incorporate into the formalism the effect of additional\nphotocurrent decrease with subcell number increase. It is shown that for an\nexperimentally observed Shockley-Read-Hall lifetimes, the effect of\nre-absorption and re-emission of photons on MJSC efficiency can be neglected\nfor non-concentrated radiation conditions. A significant efficiency $\\eta$\nincrease can be achieved by improving the heat dissipation using radiators and\nbringing the MJSC emissivity to unity, that is closer to black body radiation\nrather than grey body radiation. Our calculated efficiencies compare well with\nother numerical results available and are consistent with the experimentally\nachieved efficiencies. The formalism can be used to optimize parameters of\nMJSCs for maximum photoconversion efficiency.\n", "  Microwave reflectometry is a non-intrusive plasma diagnostic tool which is\nwidely applied in many fusion devices. In 2014, the microwave reflectometry on\nExperimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) had been upgraded to\nmeasure plasma density profile and fluctuation, which covered the frequency\nrange of Q-band (32-56 GHz), V-band (47-76 GHz) and W-band (71-110 GHz). This\npaper presented a dedicated data acquisition and control system (DAQC) to meet\nthe measurement requirements of high accuracy and temporal resolution. The DAQC\nconsisted of two control modules, which integrated arbitrary waveform\ngeneration block (AWG) and trigger processing block (TP), and two data\nacquisition modules (DAQ) that was implemented base on the PXIe platform from\nNational Instruments (NI). All the performance parameters had satisfied the\nrequirements of reflectometry. The actual performance will be further examined\nin the experiments of EAST in 2014.\n", "  Coating Brownian noise is the dominant noise term, in a frequency band from a\nfew tens to a few hundreds Hz, for all Earth-bound detectors of gravitational\nwaves. Minimizing such noise is mandatory to increase the visibility distance\nof these instruments, and eventually reach their quantum limit. Several\nstrategies are possible to achieve this goal. Layer thickness optimization is\nthe simplest option, yielding a sensible noise reduction with limited\ntechnological challenges. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of the\nunderlying theory, and the robustness of the design.\n", "  A high precision and high resolution time-to-digital converter (TDC)\nimplemented in a 40 nm fabrication process Virtex-6 FPGA is presented in this\npaper. The multi-chain measurements averaging architecture is used to overcome\nthe resolution limitation determined by intrinsic cell delay of the plain\nsingle tapped-delay chain. The resolution and precision are both improved with\nthis architecture. In such a TDC, the input signal is connected to multiple\ntapped-delay chains simultaneously (the chain number is M), and there is a\nfixed delay cell between every two adjacent chains. Each tapped-delay chain is\njust a plain TDC and should generate a TDC time for a hit input signal, so\ntotally M TDC time values should be got for a hit signal. After averaging, the\nfinal TDC time is obtained. A TDC with 3 ps resolution (i.e. bin size) and 6.5\nps precision (i.e. RMS) has been implemented using 8 parallel tapped-delay\nchains. Meanwhile the plain TDC with single tapped-delay chain yields 24 ps\nresolution and 18 ps precision.\n", "  We present the comparison of results from the generation and the measurement\nof direct currents in the pA range, performed with traceable state-of-the-art\nmethods at highest accuracy. The currents were generated with the capacitor\ncharging method, and measured with the first prototype of a novel picoammeter\ndeveloped at PTB. The results confirm the agreement between both methods and\nthe linearity of the new picoammeter at an uncertainty level of few microA/A.\nAlso, they shed light on the ac-dc difference of capacitors, crucial for\ncurrent generation with the capacitor charging method.\n", "  A satellite navigation system for a safety critical application is required\nto provide an integrity alert of any malfunction; the probability that a\nnavigation positioning error exceeds a given alert limit without an integrity\nalert is required to be smaller than a given integrity risk. So far, a little\nnumber of applications provide integrity alerts, because signal propagation\nfrom a satellite to a receiver depends on diversified phenomena and makes\nprobabilistic upper-bound of possible threats difficult. To widen application\nfields of satellite navigation, two methods to upper-bound wide classes of bias\nerrors are shown in this paper. The worst bias error in a maximum likelihood\nestimate caused by an interference signal within a given small power is\nderived. A novel inequality condition with a clock bias error and magnification\ncoefficients that upper-bounds a horizontal position error is presented.\nRobustness of the inequality condition is numerically shown based on actual\nconfigurations of satellites.\n", "  The Dick effect can be a limitation of the achievable frequency stability of\na passive atomic frequency standard when the ancillary frequency source is only\nperiodically sampled. Here we analyze the Dick effect for a pulsed vapor cell\nclock using coherent population trapping (CPT). Due to its specific\ninterrogation process without atomic preparation nor detection outside of the\nRamsey pulses, it exhibits an original shape of the sensitivity function to\nphase noise of the oscillator. Numerical calculations using a three-level atom\nmodel are successfully compared with measurements; an approximate formula of\nthe sensitivity function is given as an easy-to-use tool. A comparison of our\nCPT clock sensitivity to phase noise with a clock of the same duty cycle using\na two-level system reveals a higher sensitivity in the CPT case. The influence\nof a free-evolution time variation and of a detection duration lengthening on\nthis sensitivity is studied. Finally this study permitted to choose an adapted\nquartz oscillator and allowed an improvement of the clock fractional frequency\nstability at the level of 3.2x10-13 at 1s\n", "  The nature of scientific and technological data collection is evolving\nrapidly: data volumes and rates grow exponentially, with increasing complexity\nand information content, and there has been a transition from static data sets\nto data streams that must be analyzed in real time. Interesting or anomalous\nphenomena must be quickly characterized and followed up with additional\nmeasurements via optimal deployment of limited assets. Modern astronomy\npresents a variety of such phenomena in the form of transient events in digital\nsynoptic sky surveys, including cosmic explosions (supernovae, gamma ray\nbursts), relativistic phenomena (black hole formation, jets), potentially\nhazardous asteroids, etc. We have been developing a set of machine learning\ntools to detect, classify and plan a response to transient events for astronomy\napplications, using the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) as a\nscientific and methodological testbed. The ability to respond rapidly to the\npotentially most interesting events is a key bottleneck that limits the\nscientific returns from the current and anticipated synoptic sky surveys.\nSimilar challenge arise in other contexts, from environmental monitoring using\nsensor networks to autonomous spacecraft systems. Given the exponential growth\nof data rates, and the time-critical response, we need a fully automated and\nrobust approach. We describe the results obtained to date, and the possible\nfuture developments.\n", "  We evidence a Kovacs-like memory effect in a uniformly driven granular gas. A\nsystem of inelastic hard particles, in the low density limit, can reach a\nnon-equilibrium steady state when properly forced. By following a certain\nprotocol for the drive time dependence, we prepare the gas in a state where the\ngranular temperature coincides with its long time value. The temperature\nsubsequently does not remain constant, but exhibits a non-monotonic evolution\nwith either a maximum or a minimum, depending on the dissipation, and on the\nprotocol. We present a theoretical analysis of this memory effect, at\nBoltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation level, and show that when dissipation exceeds\na threshold, the response can be coined anomalous. We find an excellent\nagreement between the analytical predictions and direct Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n", "  Quantum memories are enabling devices for extending the reach of quantum key\ndistribution (QKD) systems. The required specifications for memories are,\nhowever, often considered too demanding for available technologies. One can\nchange this mindset by introducing memory-assisted\nmeasurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD), which imposes less stringent\nconditions on the memory modules. It has been shown that, in the case of {\\em\nfast} single-qubit memories, we can reach rates and distances not attainable by\nsingle no-memory QKD links. Single-qubit memories, such as single atoms or\nions, have, currently, too slow of an access time to offer an advantage in\npractice. Here, we relax that assumption, and consider ensemble-based memories,\nwhich satisfy the main two requirements of having short access times and large\nstorage-bandwidth products. Our results, however, suggest that the\nmultiple-excitation effects in such memories can be so detrimental that they\nmay wash away the scaling improvement offered by memory-equipped systems. We\nthen propose an alternative setup that can in principle remedy the above\nproblem. As a prelude to our main problem, we also obtain secret key generation\nrates for MDI-QKD systems that rely on imperfect single-photon sources with\nnonzero probabilities of emitting two photons.\n", "  An increase in the quality factor of superconducting radiofrequency cavities\nis achieved by minimizing the surface resistance during processing steps. The\nsurface resistance is the sum of temperature independent residual resistance\nand temperature/material dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) resistance.\nHigh temperature heat treatment usually reduces the impurities concentration\nfrom the bulk niobium, lowering the residual resistance. The BCS part can be\nreduced by selectively doping non-magnetic impurities. The increase in quality\nfactor, termed as Q-rise, was observed in cavities when titanium or nitrogen\nthermally diffused in the inner cavity surface.\n", "  Modern commercial direct-current current transformers (DCCT) can measure\ncurrents up to the kA range with accuracies better than 1E-5. We discuss here a\nDCCT calibration method and its implementation with commercial instruments\ntypically employed in low resistance calibration laboratories. The primary\ncurrent ranges up to 2 kA; in the current range below \\SI{100}{\\ampere} the\ncalibration uncertainty is better than 3E-7. An example of calibration of a\nhigh-performance DCCT specified for primary currents measurement up to 900 A is\ndiscussed in detail.\n", "  Single-molecule atomic force spectroscopy probes elastic properties of titin,\nubiquitin and other relevant proteins. We explain bioprotein folding dynamics\nunder both length- and force-clamp by modeling polyprotein modules as particles\nin a bistable potential, weakly connected by harmonic spring linkers.\nMultistability of equilibrium extensions provides the characteristic sawtooth\nforce-extension curve. We show that abrupt or stepwise unfolding and refolding\nunder force-clamp conditions involve transitions through virtual states (which\nare quasi-stationary domain configurations) modified by thermal noise. These\npredictions agree with experimental observations.\n", "  It is generally accepted that neighboring nodes in financial networks are\nnegatively assorted with respect to the correlation between their degrees. This\nfeature would play an important 'damping' role in the market during downturns\n(periods of distress) since this connectivity pattern between firms lowers the\nchances of auto-amplifying (the propagation of) distress. In this paper we\nexplore a trade-network of industrial firms where the nodes are suppliers or\nbuyers, and the links are those invoices that the suppliers send out to their\nbuyers and then go on to present to their bank for discounting. The network was\ncollected by a large Italian bank in 2007, from their intermediation of the\nsales on credit made by their clients. The network also shows dissortative\nbehavior as seen in other studies on financial networks. However, when looking\nat the credit rating of the firms, an important attribute internal to each\nnode, we find that firms that trade with one another share overwhelming\nsimilarity. We know that much data is missing from our data set. However, we\ncan quantify the amount of missing data using information exposure, a variable\nthat connects social structure and behavior. This variable is a ratio of the\nsales invoices that a supplier presents to their bank over their total sales.\nResults reveal a non-trivial and robust relationship between the information\nexposure and credit rating of a firm, indicating the influence of the neighbors\non a firm's rating. This methodology provides a new insight into how to\nreconstruct a network suffering from incomplete information.\n", "  In this paper, we study controllability of a network of linear\nsingle-integrator agents when the network size goes to infinity. We first\ninvestigate the effect of increasing size by injecting an input at every node\nand requiring that network controllability Gramian remain well-conditioned with\nthe increasing dimension. We provide theoretical justification to the intuition\nthat high degree nodes pose a challenge to network controllability. In\nparticular, the controllability Gramian for the networks with bounded maximum\ndegrees is shown to remain well-conditioned even as the network size goes to\ninfinity. In the canonical cases of star, chain and ring networks, we also\nprovide closed-form expressions which bound the condition number of the\ncontrollability Gramian in terms of the network size. We next consider the\neffect of the choice and number of leader nodes by actuating only a subset of\nnodes and considering the least eigenvalue of the Gramian as the network size\nincreases. Accordingly, while a directed star topology can never be made\ncontrollable for all sizes by injecting an input just at a fraction $f<1$ of\nnodes; for path or cycle networks, the designer can actuate a non-zero fraction\nof nodes and spread them throughout the network in such way that the least\neigenvalue of the Gramians remain bounded away from zero with the increasing\nsize. The results offer interesting insights on the challenges of control in\nlarge networks and with high-degree nodes.\n", "  In this paper, the acoustic interaction forces and torques exerted by an\narbitrary time-harmonic wave on a set of N spheres suspended in an inviscid\nfluid are theoretically analyzed. In so doing, we utilize the partial-wave\nexpansion method to solve the related multiple scattering problem. The acoustic\ninteraction force and torque are computed for a sphere using the farfield\nradiation force and torque formulas. To exemplify the method, we calculate the\ninteraction forces exerted by an external traveling and standing plane wave on\nan arrangement of two and three olive-oil droplets in water. The droplets radii\nare comparable to the wavelength (i.e. Mie scattering regime). The results show\nthat the radiation force may considerably deviates from that exerted solely by\nthe external incident wave. In addition, we find that acoustic interaction\ntorques arise on the droplets when a nonsymmetric effective incident wave\ninteracts with the droplets.\n", "  Random geometric networks consist of 1) a set of nodes embedded randomly in a\nbounded domain $\\mathcal{V} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ and 2) links formed\nprobabilistically according to a function of mutual Euclidean separation. We\nquantify how often all paths in the network characterisable as topologically\n`shortest' contain a given node (betweenness centrality), deriving an\nexpression in terms of a known integral whenever 1) the network boundary is the\nperimeter of a disk and 2) the network is extremely dense. Our method shows how\nsimilar formulas can be obtained for any convex geometry. Numerical\ncorroboration is provided, as well as a discussion of our formula's potential\nuse for cluster head election and boundary detection in densely deployed\nwireless ad hoc networks.\n", "  The modeling of cascading failure in power systems is difficult because of\nthe many different mechanisms involved; no single model captures all of these\nmechanisms. Understanding the relative importance of these different mechanisms\nis an important step in choosing which mechanisms need to be modeled for\nparticular types of cascading failure analysis. This work presents a dynamic\nsimulation model of both power networks and protection systems, which can\nsimulate a wider variety of cascading outage mechanisms, relative to existing\nquasi-steady state (QSS) models. The model allows one to test the impact of\ndifferent load models and protections on cascading outage sizes. This paper\ndescribes each module of the developed dynamic model and demonstrates how\ndifferent mechanisms interact. In order to test the model we simulated a batch\nof randomly selected $N-2$ contingencies for several different static load\nconfigurations, and found that the distribution of blackout sizes and event\nlengths from the proposed dynamic simulator correlates well with historical\ntrends. The results also show that load models have significant impacts on the\ncascading risks. This dynamic model was also compared against a QSS model based\non the dc power flow approximations; we find that the two models largely agree,\nbut produce substantially different results for later stages of cascading.\n", "  The period between the creation of the cosmic microwave background at a\nredshift of ~1000 and the formation of the first stars and black holes that\nre-ionize the intergalactic medium at redshifts of 10-20 is currently\nunobservable. The baryonic component of the universe during this period is\nalmost entirely neutral hydrogen, which falls into local regions of higher dark\nmatter density. This seeds the formation of large-scale structures including\nthe cosmic web that we see today in the filamentary distribution of galaxies\nand clusters of galaxies. The only detectable signal from these dark ages is\nthe 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen, redshifted down to frequencies of\napproximately 10-100 MHz. Space-based observations of this signal will allow us\nto determine the formation epoch and physics of the first sources of ionizing\nradiation, and potentially detect evidence for the decay of dark matter\nparticles. JPL is developing deployable low frequency antenna and receiver\nprototypes to enable both all-sky spectral measurements of neutral hydrogen and\nultimately to map the spatial distribution of the signal as a function of\nredshift. Such observations must be done from space because of Earth's\nionosphere and ubiquitous radio interference. A specific application of these\ntechnologies is the Dark Ages Radio Explorer (DARE) mission. This small\nExplorer class mission is designed to measure the sky-averaged hydrogen signal\nfrom the shielded region above the far side of the Moon. These data will\ncomplement ground-based radio observations of the final stages of intergalactic\nre-ionization at higher frequencies. DARE will also serve as a scientific\npercursor for space-based interferometry missions to image the distribution of\nhydrogen during the cosmic dark ages.\n", "  In this paper, via the generalized Darboux transformation, rational soliton\nsolutions are derived for the parity-time-symmetric nonlocal nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) model with the defocusing-type nonlinearity. We find that\nthe first-order solution can exhibit the elastic interactions of rational\nantidark-antidark, dark-antidark, and antidark-dark soliton pairs on a\ncontinuous wave background, but there is no phase shift for the interacting\nsolitons. Also, we discuss the degenerate case in which only one rational dark\nor antidark soliton survives. Moreover, we reveal that the second-order\nrational solution displays the interactions between two solitons with\ncombined-peak-valley structures in the near-field regions, but each interacting\nsoliton vanishes or evolves into a rational dark or antidark soliton as $|z|\\ra\n\\infty$. In addition, we numerically examine the stability of the first- and\nsecond-order rational soliton solutions.\n", "  In a cyclic entropy model in which the extroverse is jettisoned at turnaround\nwith a Come Back Empty assumption, we address matching of the contraction scale\nfactor $f(t_T)a(t)$ to the expansion scale factor $a(t)$, where $f(t_T)$ is the\nratio at turnaround of the introverse to extroverse radii. Such matching is\nnecessary for infinite cyclicity and fixes the CBE period at $\\sim 2.6$ Ty. We\nthen compare such a CBE model with alternative cyclic cosmologies including\nPenrose Conformal Cyclic Cosmology of period $10^{100}$ y, and speculate that\nthe CBE model may be related to the CCC model by a highly nontrivial\nisomorphism.\n", "  With the increasingly new ultra wide-band applications, antenna researchers\nface huge challenges in designing novel operational geometries. Mono-pole and\nquasi-mono-pole antennas are seen to be the most compact and easily incorporate\nable solution for portable devices taking the advantages of printed circuit\nboard (PCB) techniques. Most antennas of such type have symmetrical structures.\nIt is possible to attain wider operating bandwidths by meeting symmetry\nconditions while chopping the antenna into halves for a compact structure.\nHowever, there is no generalized way of applying such a technique. The\npresented paper addresses this issue by proposing a common feeding technique\nthat can be applied to any antenna which is miniaturized using its symmetrical\nstructure. The proposed technique enables feeding the halved structure to\nachieve wider and better impedance matching than the reported full-size\nantennas. The theory of characteristic modes is applied to quasi-mono-pole\nstructures to get an insight of the antennas mechanism. The radiation patterns\nare also correlated with modal current distributions to understand the\nradiation characteristics of the modified structure. Lastly, the method is\nimplemented on some example antennas to illustrate its potential.\n", "  In this manuscript, an effort is made in this review to address different\nstate-of-the-art artificial tissue emulating (ATE) materials and phantom types\nfor various operating frequencies, and fabrication procedures in order to have\na better understanding of the pros and cons of various ATE phantoms which leads\nus to develop superior version of artificial human body substitute for various\napplications.\n", "  We present the design and implementation of a custom GPU-based compute\ncluster that provides the correlation X-engine of the CHIME Pathfinder radio\ntelescope. It is among the largest such systems in operation, correlating\n32,896 baselines (256 inputs) over 400MHz of radio bandwidth. Making heavy use\nof consumer-grade parts and a custom software stack, the system was developed\nat a small fraction of the cost of comparable installations. Unlike existing\nGPU backends, this system is built around OpenCL kernels running on\nconsumer-level AMD GPUs, taking advantage of low-cost hardware and leveraging\npacked integer operations to double algorithmic efficiency. The system achieves\nthe required 105TOPS in a 10kW power envelope, making it among the most\npower-efficient X-engines in use today.\n", "  The Mindlin plate equations with the consideration of thickness-shear\ndeformation as an independent variable have been used for the analysis of\nvibrations of quartz crystal resonators of both rectangular and circular types.\nThe Mindlin or Lee plate theories that treat thickness-shear deformation as an\nindependent higher-order vibration mode in a coupled system of two-dimensional\nvariables are the choice of theory for analysis. For circular plates, we\nderived the Mindlin plate equations in a systematic manner as demonstrated by\nMindlin and others and obtained the truncated two-dimensional equations of\nclosely coupled modes in polar coordinates. We simplified the equations for\nvibration modes in the vicinity of fundamental thickness-shear frequency and\nvalidated the equations and method. To explore newer structures of quartz\ncrystal resonators, we utilized the Mindlin plate equations for the analysis of\nannular plates with fixed inner and free outer edges for frequency spectra. The\ndetailed analysis of vibrations of circular plates for the normalized frequency\nversus dimensional parameters provide references for optimal selection of\nparameters based on the principle of strong thickness-shear mode and minimal\npresence of other modes to enhance energy trapping through maintaining the\nstrong and pure thickness-shear vibrations insensitive to some complication\nfactors such as thermal and initial stresses.\n", "  For quartz crystal resonators of thickness-shear type, the vibration\nfrequency and mode shapes, which are key features of resonators in circuit\napplications, reflect the basic material and structural properties of the\nquartz plate and its variation with time under various factors such as erosive\ngases and liquids that can cause surface and internal damages and degradation\nof crystal blanks. The accumulated effects eventually will change the surface\nconditions in terms of elastic constants and stiffness and more importantly,\nthe gradient of such properties along the thickness. This is a typical\nfunctionally graded materials (FGM) structure and has been studied extensively\nfor structural applications under multiple loadings such as thermal and\nelectromagnetic fields in recent years. For acoustic wave resonators, such\nstudies are equally important and the wave propagation in FGM structures can be\nused in the evaluation and assessment of performance, reliability, and life of\nsensors based on acoustic waves such as the quartz crystal microbalances (QCM).\nNow we studied the thickness-shear vibrations of FGM plates with properties of\nAT-cut quartz crystal varying along the thickness in a general pattern\nrepresented by a trigonometric function with both sine and cosine functions of\nthe thickness coordinate. The solutions are obtained by using Fourier expansion\nof the plate deformation. We also obtained the frequency changes of the\nfundamental and overtone modes which are strongly coupled for the evaluation of\nresonator structures with property variation or design to take advantages of\nFGM in novel applications.\n", "  The paper deals with the possibly degenerate behaviour of the exterior\nderivative operator defined on $1$-forms on metric measure spaces. The main\nexamples we consider are the non self-similar Sierpinski carpets recently\nintroduced by Mackay, Tyson and Wildrick. Although topologically\none-dimensional, they may have positive two-dimensional Lebesgue measure and\ncarry nontrivial $2$-forms. We prove that in this case the curl operator (and\ntherefore also the exterior derivative on $1$-forms) is not closable, and that\nits adjoint operator has a trivial domain. We also formulate a similar more\nabstract result. It states that for spaces that are, in a certain way,\nstructurally similar to Sierpinski carpets, the exterior derivative operator\ntaking $1$-forms into $2$-forms cannot be closable if the martingale dimension\nis larger than one.\n", "  The behaviour of a high dimensional stochastic system described by a Chemical\nMaster Equation (CME) depends on many parameters, rendering explicit simulation\nan inefficient method for exploring the properties of such models. Capturing\ntheir behaviour by low-dimensional models makes analysis of system behaviour\ntractable. In this paper, we present low dimensional models for the\nnoise-induced excitable dynamics in Bacillus subtilis, whereby a key protein\nComK, which drives a complex chain of reactions leading to bacterial\ncompetence, gets expressed rapidly in large quantities (competent state) before\nsubsiding to low levels of expression (vegetative state). These rapid reactions\nsuggest the application of an adiabatic approximation of the dynamics of the\nregulatory model that, however, lead to competence durations that are incorrect\nby a factor of 2. We apply a modified version of an iterative functional\nprocedure that faithfully approximates the time-course of the trajectories in\nterms of a 2-dimensional model involving proteins ComK and ComS. Furthermore,\nin order to describe the bimodal bivariate marginal probability distribution\nobtained from the Gillespie simulations of the CME, we introduce a tunable\nmultiplicative noise term in a 2-dimensional Langevin model whose stationary\nstate is described by the time-independent solution of the corresponding\nFokker-Planck equation.\n", "  Owing to the large breakdown electric field, wide bandgap semiconductors such\nas SiC, GaN, Ga2O3 and diamond based power devices are the focus for next\ngeneration power switching applications. The unipolar trade-off relationship\nbetween the area specific-on resistance and breakdown voltage is often employed\nto compare the performance limitation among various materials. The GaN material\nsystem has a unique advantage due to its prominent spontaneous and\npiezoelectric polarization effects in GaN, AlN, InN, AlxInyGaN alloys and\nflexibility in inserting appropriate heterojunctions thus dramatically broaden\nthe device design space.\n", "  The Minos+ experiment is an extension of the Minos experiment at a higher\nenergy and more intense neutrino beam, with the data collection having begun in\nthe fall of 2013. The neutrino beam is provided by the Neutrinos from the Main\nInjector (NuMI) beam-line at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab).\nThe detector apparatus consists of two main detectors, one underground at\nFermilab and the other in Soudan, Minnesota with the purpose of studying\nneutrino oscillations at a base line of 735 km. The original data acquisition\nsystem has been running for several years collecting data from NuMI, but with\nthe extended run from 2013, parts of the system needed to be replaced due to\nobsolescence, reliability problems, and data throughput limitations.\nSpecifically, we have replaced the front-end readout controllers, event\nbuilder, and data acquisition computing and trigger processing farms with\nmodern, modular and reliable devices with few single points of failure. The new\nsystem is based on gigabit Ethernet TCP/IP communication to implement the event\nbuilding and concatenation of data from many front-end VME readout crates. The\nsimplicity and partitionability of the new system greatly eases the debugging\nand diagnosing process. The new system improves throughput by about a factor of\nthree compared to the old system, up to 800 megabits per second, and has proven\nrobust and reliable in the current run.\n", "  This paper is concerned with variational methods for nonlinear open quantum\nsystems with Markovian dynamics governed by Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum\nstochastic differential equations. The latter are driven by quantum Wiener\nprocesses of the external boson fields and are specified by the system\nHamiltonian and system-field coupling operators. We consider the system\nresponse to perturbations of these energy operators and introduce a transverse\nHamiltonian which encodes the propagation of the perturbations through the\nunitary system-field evolution. This provides a tool for the infinitesimal\nperturbation analysis and development of optimality conditions for coherent\nquantum control problems. We apply the transverse Hamiltonian variational\ntechnique to a mean square optimal coherent quantum filtering problem for a\nmeasurement-free cascade connection of quantum systems.\n", "  Given a large-scale graph with millions of nodes and edges, how to reveal\nmacro patterns of interest, like cliques, bi-partite cores, stars, and chains?\nFurthermore, how to visualize such patterns altogether getting insights from\nthe graph to support wise decision-making? Although there are many algorithmic\nand visual techniques to analyze graphs, none of the existing approaches is\nable to present the structural information of graphs at large-scale. Hence,\nthis paper describes StructMatrix, a methodology aimed at high-scalable visual\ninspection of graph structures with the goal of revealing macro patterns of\ninterest. StructMatrix combines algorithmic structure detection and adjacency\nmatrix visualization to present cardinality, distribution, and relationship\nfeatures of the structures found in a given graph. We performed experiments in\nreal, large-scale graphs with up to one million nodes and millions of edges.\nStructMatrix revealed that graphs of high relevance (e.g., Web, Wikipedia and\nDBLP) have characterizations that reflect the nature of their corresponding\ndomains; our findings have not been seen in the literature so far. We expect\nthat our technique will bring deeper insights into large graph mining,\nleveraging their use for decision making.\n", "  We initiate the study of $1/2$ BPS Wilson loops in $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nChern-Simons-matter theories in three dimensions. We consider a circular or\nlinear quiver with Chern-Simons levels $k$, $-k$ and $0$, and focus on loops\npreserving one of the two $SU(2)$ subgroups of the $R$-symmetry. In the cases\nwith no vanishing Chern-Simons levels, we find a pair of Wilson loops for each\npair of adjacent nodes on the quiver connected by a hypermultiplet (nodes\nconnected by twisted hypermultiplets have Wilson loops preserving another set\nof supercharges). We expect this classical pairwise degeneracy to be lifted by\nquantum corrections. In the case with nodes with vanishing Chern-Simons terms\nconnected by twisted hypermultiplets, we find that the usual $1/4$ BPS Wilson\nloops are automatically enlarged to $1/2$ BPS, as happens also in 3-dimensional\nYang-Mills theory. When the nodes with vanishing Chern-Simons levels are\nconnected by untwisted hypermultiplets, we do not find any Wilson loops\ncoupling to those nodes which are classically invariant. Rather, we find\nseveral loops whose supersymmetry variation, while non zero, vanishes in any\ncorrelation function, so is weakly zero. We expect only one linear combination\nof those Wilson loops to remain BPS when quantum corrections are included. We\nanalyze the M-theory duals of those Wilson loops and comment on their\ndegeneracy. We also show that these Wilson loops are cohomologically equivalent\nto certain $1/4$ BPS Wilson loops whose expectation value can be evaluated by\nthe appropriate localized matrix model.\n", "  ZnSnN2 has recently garnered increasing interest as a potential solar\nabsorber material due to its direct bandgap that is predicted to be tunable\nfrom 1.0-2.1 eV based on cation disorder. One important challenge to the\nfurther development of this material for photovoltaics (PV) is to reliably\nsynthesize films with carrier density less than or equal to 10^17\nelectrons/cm^3. In this work, we perform a systematic annealing study on\ncompositionally-graded Zn-Sn-N thin films to determine the effects on carrier\ndensity and transport of such post-growth treatment. We find that annealing up\nto 6 hr under an activated nitrogen atmosphere results in a reduction in\ncarrier density by ~80% for zinc-rich films, and by ~50% for stoichiometric\nfilms. However, we also find that annealing reduces mobility as a function of\nincreasing annealing time. This result suggests that initial film disorder\nhampers the benefits to film quality that should have been gained through\nannealing. This finding highlights that carefully managed initial growth\nconditions will be necessary to obtain PV-quality ZnSnN2 absorber films.\n", "  In this paper, we first discuss the definition of modularity (Q) used as a\nmetric for community quality and then we review the modularity maximization\napproaches which were used for community detection in the last decade. Then, we\ndiscuss two opposite yet coexisting problems of modularity optimization: in\nsome cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in\nothers, large communities over small ones (so called the resolution limit\nproblem). Next, we overview several community quality metrics proposed to solve\nthe resolution limit problem and discuss Modularity Density (Qds) which\nsimultaneously avoids the two problems of modularity. Finally, we introduce two\nnovel fine-tuned community detection algorithms that iteratively attempt to\nimprove the community quality measurements by splitting and merging the given\nnetwork community structure. The first of them, referred to as Fine-tuned Q, is\nbased on modularity (Q) while the second one is based on Modularity Density\n(Qds) and denoted as Fine-tuned Qds. Then, we compare the greedy algorithm of\nmodularity maximization (denoted as Greedy Q), Fine-tuned Q, and Fine-tuned Qds\non four real networks, and also on the classical clique network and the LFR\nbenchmark networks, each of which is instantiated by a wide range of\nparameters. The results indicate that Fine-tuned Qds is the most effective\namong the three algorithms discussed. Moreover, we show that Fine-tuned Qds can\nbe applied to the communities detected by other algorithms to significantly\nimprove their results.\n", "  Automatic resonance alignment tuning is performed in high-order series\ncoupled microring filters using a feedback system. By inputting only a\nreference wavelength, a filter is tuned such that passband ripples are\ndramatically reduced compared to the initial detuned state and the passband\nbecomes centered at the reference. The method is tested on 5th order microring\nfilters fabricated in a standard silicon photonics foundry process. Repeatable\ntuning is demonstrated for filters on multiple dies from the wafer and for\narbitrary reference wavelengths within the free spectral range of the\nmicrorings.\n", "  We introduce a model described in terms of a scalar velocity field on a 1d\nlattice, evolving through collisions that conserve momentum but do not conserve\nenergy. Such a system posseses some of the main ingredients of fluidized\ngranular media and naturally models them. We deduce non-linear fluctuating\nhydrodynamics equations for the macroscopic velocity and temperature fields,\nwhich replicate the hydrody- namics of shear modes in a granular fluid.\nMoreover, this Landau-like fluctuating hydrodynamics predicts an essential part\nof the peculiar behaviour of granular flu- ids, like the instability of\nhomogeneous cooling state at large size or inelasticity. We compute also the\nexact shape of long range spatial correlations which, even far from the\ninstability, have the physical consequence of noticeably modifying the cooling\nrate. This effect, which stems from momentum conservation, has not been\npreviously reported in the realm of granular fluids.\n", "  Inspiraling binary neutron stars are expected to be one of the most\nsignificant sources of gravitational-wave signals for the new generation of\nadvanced ground-based detectors. We investigate how well we could hope to\nmeasure properties of these binaries using the Advanced LIGO detectors, which\nbegan operation in September 2015. We study an astrophysically motivated\npopulation of sources (binary components with masses\n$1.2~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$--$1.6~\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and spins of less than $0.05$)\nusing the full LIGO analysis pipeline. While this simulated population covers\nthe observed range of potential binary neutron-star sources, we do not exclude\nthe possibility of sources with parameters outside these ranges; given the\nexisting uncertainty in distributions of mass and spin, it is critical that\nanalyses account for the full range of possible mass and spin configurations.\nWe find that conservative prior assumptions on neutron-star mass and spin lead\nto average fractional uncertainties in component masses of $\\sim 16\\%$, with\nlittle constraint on spins (the median $90\\%$ upper limit on the spin of the\nmore massive component is $\\sim 0.7$). Stronger prior constraints on\nneutron-star spins can further constrain mass estimates, but only marginally.\nHowever, we find that the sky position and luminosity distance for these\nsources are not influenced by the inclusion of spin; therefore, if LIGO detects\na low-spin population of BNS sources, less computationally expensive results\ncalculated neglecting spin will be sufficient for guiding electromagnetic\nfollow-up.\n", "  Understanding the physics of non-equilibrium systems remains as one of the\nmajor open questions in statistical physics. This problem can be partially\nhandled by investigating macroscopic fluctuations of key magnitudes that\ncharacterise the non-equilibrium behaviour of the system of interest; their\nstatistics, associated structures and microscopic origin. During the last\nyears, some new general and powerful methods have appeared to delve into\nfluctuating behaviour that have drastically changed the way to address this\nproblem in the realm of diffusive systems: macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT)\nand a set of advanced computational techniques that make it possible to measure\nthe probability of rare events. Notwithstanding, a satisfactory theory is still\nlacking in a particular case of intrinsically non-equilibrium systems, namely\nthose in which energy is not conserved but dissipated continuously in the bulk\nof the system (e.g. granular media). In this work, we put forward the\ndissipated energy as a relevant quantity in this case and analyse in a\npedagogical way its fluctuations, by making use of a suitable generalisation of\nmacroscopic fluctuation theory to driven dissipative media.\n", "  Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) of thin flexible fins coupled with\nconvective heat transfer has applications in energy harvesting and in\nunderstanding functioning of several biological systems. We numerically\ninvestigate FSI of the thin flexible fins involving large-scale flow-induced\ndeformation as a potential heat transfer enhancement technique. An in-house,\nstrongly-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver is employed in which\nflow and structure solvers are based on sharp-interface immersed boundary and\nfinite element method, respectively. We consider twin flexible fins in a heated\nchannel with laminar pulsating cross flow. The vortex ring past the fin sweep\nhigher sources of vorticity generated on the channel walls out into the\ndownstream - promoting the mixing of the fluid. The moving fin assists in\nconvective mixing, augmenting convection in bulk and at the walls; and thereby\nreducing thermal boundary layer thickness and improving heat transfer at the\nchannel walls. The thermal augmentation is quantified in term of instantaneous\nNusselt number at the wall. Results are presented for two limiting cases of\nthermal conductivity of the fin - an insulated fin and a highly conductive fin.\nWe discuss feasibility of flexible fins and effect of flow cycle-to-cycle\nvariation on the Nusselt number. Finally, we investigate the effect of\nimportant problem parameters - Young's Modulus, flow frequency and Prandtl\nnumber - on the thermal augmentation.\n", "  We present a comparison of the in-plane length scale over which charge and\nmagnetism are correlated in (La0.4Pr0.6)1-xCaxMnO3 films with x = 0.33 and\n0.375, across the metal to insulator transition (MIT) temperature. We combine\nelectrical transport (resistance) measurements, x-ray absorption spectroscopy\n(XAS), x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and specular/off-specular\nx-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) measurements as a function of\ntemperature to elucidate relationships between electronic, magnetic and\nmorphological structure of the thin films. Using off-specular XRMS we obtained\nthe charge-charge and charge-magnetic correlation length of these LPCMO films\nnear the MIT. The charge-magnetic correlation length (~ 12000 {\\AA}) for x =\n0.33 was much larger (~4 times) than the charge-charge correlation length (~\n3200 {\\AA}) at 20 K. Whereas for x = 0.375 the charge-magnetic correlation\nlength (~ 7500 {\\AA}) was smaller than the charge-charge correlation length (~\n9000 {\\AA}).\n", "  We firstly revisit the importance, naturalness and limitations of the\nso-called optical metrics for describing the propagation of light rays in the\nlimit of geometric optics. We then exemplify their flexibility and\nnontriviality in some nonlinear material media and in the context of nonlinear\ntheories of the electromagnetism, both underlain by curved backgrounds, where\noptical metrics could be flat and impermeable membranes only to photons could\nbe conceived, respectively. Finally, we underline and discuss the relevance and\npotential applications of our analyses in a broad sense, ranging from material\nmedia to compact astrophysical systems.\n", "  Modern networks are becoming increasingly interdependent. As a prominent\nexample, the smart grid is an electrical grid controlled through a\ncommunications network, which in turn is powered by the electrical grid. Such\ninterdependencies create new vulnerabilities and make these networks more\nsusceptible to failures. In particular, failures can easily spread across these\nnetworks due to their interdependencies, possibly causing cascade effects with\na devastating impact on their functionalities.\n  In this paper we focus on the interdependence between the power grid and the\ncommunications network, and propose a novel realistic model, HINT\n(Heterogeneous Interdependent NeTworks), to study the evolution of cascading\nfailures. Our model takes into account the heterogeneity of such networks as\nwell as their complex interdependencies. We compare HINT with previously\nproposed models both on synthetic and real network topologies. Experimental\nresults show that existing models oversimplify the failure evolution and\nnetwork functionality requirements, resulting in severe underestimations of the\ncascading failures.\n", "  The web-based Go-Smart environment is a scalable system that allows the\nprediction of minimally invasive cancer treatment. Interventional radiologists\ncreate a patient-specific 3D model by semi-automatic segmentation and\nregistration of pre-interventional CT (Computed Tomography) and/or MRI\n(Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images in a 2D/3D browser environment. This model\nis used to compare patient-specific treatment plans and device performance via\nbuilt-in simulation tools. Go-Smart includes evaluation techniques for\ncomparing simulated treatment with real ablation lesions segmented from\nfollow-up scans. The framework is highly extensible, allowing manufacturers and\nresearchers to incorporate new ablation devices, mathematical models and\nphysical parameters.\n", "  Nano oils comprising Graphene nanoflakes and CNTs have been experimentally\nobserved for the first time to exhibit augmented dielectric breakdown strengths\ncompared to the base transformer oils. Variant nano oils comprising different\nGr and CNT samples suspended in two different grades of transformer oils have\nyielded consistent and high degrees of enhancement in the breakdown strength.\nThe apparent counter intuitive phenomenon of enhancing insulating caliber of\nfluids utilizing nanostructures of high electronic conductance has been shown\nto be physically consistent thorough theoretical analysis. The crux mechanism\nhas been pin pointed as efficient charge scavenging leading to hampered\nstreamer growth and development, thereby delaying probability of complete\nionization. The mathematical analysis presented provides a comprehensive\npicture of the mechanisms and physics of the electrohydrodynamics involved in\nthe phenomena of enhanced breakdown strengths. Furthermore, the analysis is\nable to physically explain the various breakdown characteristics observed as\nfunctions of system parameters, such as, nanostructure type, size distribution,\nrelative permittivity, base fluid dielectric properties, nanomaterial\nconcentration and nano oil temperature. The mathematical analyses have been\nextended to propose a physically and dimensionally consistent analytical model\nto predict the enhanced breakdown strengths of such nano oils from involved\nconstituent material properties and characteristics. The model has been\nobserved to accurately predict the augmented insulating property, thereby\nrendering it as an extremely useful tool for efficient design and prediction of\nbreakdown characteristics of nanostructure infused insulating fluids.\n", "  We report the status of R&D on large triple-GEM detectors for a forward\ntracker (FT) in an experiment at a future Electron Ion Collider (EIC) that will\nimprove our understanding of QCD. We have designed a detector prototype\nspecifically targeted for the EIC-FT, which has a trapezoidal shape with 30.1\ndegrees opening angle. We are investigating different detector assembly\ntechniques and signal readout technologies, but have designed a common GEM foil\nto minimize NRE cost for foil production. The assembly techniques comprise\neither a purely mechanical method including foil stretching as pioneered by CMS\nbut with certain modifications, or gluing foils to frames that are then\nassembled mechanically, or gluing foils to frames that are then glued together.\nThe first two assembly techniques allow for re-opening chambers so that a GEM\nfoil can be replaced if it is damaged. For readout technologies, we are\npursuing a cost-effective one-dimensional readout with wide zigzag strips that\nmaintains reasonable spatial resolution, as well two-dimensional readouts - one\nwith stereo-angle (u-v) strips and another with r-phi strips. In addition, we\naim at an overall low-mass detector design to facilitate good energy resolution\nfor electrons scattered at low momenta. We present design for GEM foils and\nother detector parts, which we plan to entirely acquire from U.S. companies.\n", "  We claim that HOMFLY polynomials for virtual knots, defined with the help of\nthe matrix-model recursion relations, contain more parameters, than just the\nusual $q$ and $A = q^N$. These parameters preserve topological invariance and\ndo not show up in the case of ordinary (non-virtual) knots and links. They are\nmost conveniently observed in the hypercube formalism: then they substitute\n$q$-dimensions of certain fat graphs, which are not constrained by recursion\nand can be chosen arbitrarily. The number of these new topological invariants\nseems to grow fast with the number of non-virtual crossings: 0, 1, 1, 5, 15,\n91, 784, 9160, ... This number can be decreased by imposing the factorization\nrequirement for composites, in addition to topological invariance -- still\nfreedom remains. None of these new parameters, however, appear in HOMFLY for\nKishino unknot, which thus remains unseparated from the ordinary unknots even\nby this enriched set of knot invariants.\n", "  Three-qubit quantum gates are key ingredients for quantum error correction\nand quantum information processing. We generate quantum-control procedures to\ndesign three types of three-qubit gates, namely Toffoli, Controlled-Not-Not and\nFredkin gates. The design procedures are applicable to a system comprising\nthree nearest-neighbor-coupled superconducting artificial atoms. For each\nthree-qubit gate, the numerical simulation of the proposed scheme achieves\n99.9% fidelity, which is an accepted threshold fidelity for fault-tolerant\nquantum computing. We test our procedure in the presence of decoherence-induced\nnoise as well as show its robustness against random external noise generated by\nthe control electronics. The three-qubit gates are designed via the machine\nlearning algorithm called Subspace-Selective Self-Adaptive Differential\nEvolution (SuSSADE).\n", "  We study truncated Bose operators in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. In\nparticular the Lie algebra structure and the spectrum of the truncated Bose\noperators are discussed.\n", "  Small-diameter Muon Drift Tube (sMDT) chambers have been developed for the\nATLAS muon detector upgrade. They possess an improved rate capability and a\nmore compact design with respect to the existing chambers, which allows to\nequip detector regions uninstrument at present. The chamber assembly methods\nhave been optimized for mass production, while the sense wire positioning\naccuracy is improved to below ten microns. The chambers will be ready for\ninstallation in the winter shutdown 2016/17 of the Large Hadron Collider. The\ndesign and construction of the new sMDT chambers for ATLAS will be discussed as\nwell as measurements of their precision and performance.\n", "  Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the universe which\nmight be associated with creation of black holes. Magnetic field structure and\nburst dynamics may influence polarization of the emitted gamma-rays. Precise\npolarization detection can be an ultimate tool to unveil the true GRB\nmechanism. POLAR is a space-borne Compton scattering detector for precise\nmeasurements of the GRB polarization. It consists of a 40$\\times$40 array of\nplastic scintillator bars read out by 25 multi-anode PMTs (MaPMTs). It is\nscheduled to be launched into space in 2016 onboard of the Chinese space\nlaboratory TG2. We present a dedicated methodology for POLAR calibration and\nsome calibration results based on the combined use of the laboratory\nradioactive sources and polarized X-ray beams from the European Synchrotron\nRadiation Facility. They include calibration of the energy response,\ncomputation of the energy conversion factor vs. high voltage as well as\ndetermination of the threshold values, crosstalk contributions and polarization\nmodulation factors.\n", "  We present the upGREAT THz heterodyne arrays for far-infrared astronomy. The\nLow Frequency Array (LFA) is designed to cover the 1.9-2.5 THz range using\n2x7-pixel waveguide-based HEB mixer arrays in a dual polarization\nconfiguration. The High Frequency Array (HFA) will perform observations of the\n[OI] line at ~4.745 THz using a 7-pixel waveguide-based HEB mixer array. This\npaper describes the common design for both arrays, cooled to 4.5 K using\nclosed- cycle pulse tube technology. We then show the laboratory and telescope\ncharacterization of the first array with its 14 pixels (LFA), which culminated\nin the successful commissioning in May 2015 aboard the SOFIA airborne\nobservatory observing the [CII] fine structure transition at 1.905 THz. This is\nthe first successful demonstration of astronomical observations with a\nheterodyne focal plane array above 1 THz and is also the first time high- power\nclosed-cycle coolers for temperatures below 4.5 K are operated on an airborne\nplatform.\n", "  A comprehensive study, supported by systematic measurements and numerical\ncomputations, of the intrinsic limits of multi-GEM detectors when exposed to\nvery high particle fluxes or operated at very large gains is presented. The\nobserved variations of the gain, of the ion back-flow, and of the pulse height\nspectra are explained in terms of the effects of the spatial distribution of\npositive ions and their movement throughout the amplification structure. The\nintrinsic dynamic character of the processes involved imposes the use of a\nnon-standard simulation tool for the interpretation of the measurements.\nComputations done with a Finite Element Analysis software reproduce the\nobserved behaviour of the detector. The impact of this detailed description of\nthe detector in extreme conditions is multiple: it clarifies some detector\nbehaviours already observed, it helps in defining intrinsic limits of the GEM\ntechnology, and it suggests ways to extend them.\n", "  In contrast to bulk FeSe, which exhibits nematic order and low temperature\nsuperconductivity, atomic layers of FeSe reverse the situation, having high\ntemperature superconductivity appearing alongside a suppression of nematic\norder. To investigate this phenomenon, we study a minimal electronic model of\nFeSe, with interactions that enhance nematic fluctuations. This model is sign\nproblem free, and is simulated using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC). We\ndeveloped a DQMC algorithm with parallel tempering, which proves to be an\nefficient source of global updates and allows us to access the region of strong\ninteractions. Over a wide range of intermediate couplings, we observe\nsuperconductivity with an extended s-wave order parameter, along with enhanced,\nbut short ranged, $q=(0,0)$ ferro-orbital (nematic) order. These results are\nconsistent with approximate weak coupling treatments that predict that nematic\nfluctuations lead to superconducting pairing. Surprisingly, in the parameter\nrange under study, we do not observe nematic long range order. Instead, at\nstronger coupling an unusual insulating phase with $q=(\\pi,\\pi)$\nantiferro-orbital order appears, which is missed by weak coupling\napproximations.\n", "  We propose Monte Carlo methods to estimate the partition function of the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model in the presence of an external magnetic field. The\nestimation is done in the dual of the Forney factor graph representing the\nmodel. The proposed methods can efficiently compute an estimate of the\npartition function in a wide range of model parameters. As an example, we\nconsider models that are in a strong external field.\n", "  There are various particle detection methods used nowadays and the most\ncommon is using scintillators. Among scintillating materials, solid plastic and\nwater-based liquid scintillators (WbLS) are the latest development. In\nparticular, WbLS allows researchers to apply different particle detection\nmethods for increased experiment efficiency. This survey attempts to make an\noverview on detection methods and detectors in high-energy physics using\nscintillators. It is meant as a summary for those new to scintillator detectors\nand looking for general material on the topic.\n", "  Considering a sample of 31 exoplanetary systems detected by gravitational\nmicrolensing, we investigate whether or not the estimated distances to these\nsystems conform to the Galactic distribution of planets expected from models.\nWe derive the expected distribution of distances and relative proper motions\nfrom a simulated microlensing survey, correcting for the dominant selection\neffects that affect the planet detection sensitivity as a function of distance,\nand compare it to the observed distribution using Anderson-Darling (AD)\nhypothesis testing. Taking the relative abundance of planets in the bulge to\nthat in the disk, $f_{\\rm bulge}$, as a model parameter, we find that our model\nis only consistent with the observed distribution for $f_{\\rm bulge}<0.54$ (for\na $p$-value threshold of 0.01) implying that the bulge may be devoid of planets\nrelative to the disk. Allowing for a dependence of planet abundance on\nmetallicity and host mass, or an additional dependence of planet sensitivity on\nevent timescale does not restore consistency for $f_{\\rm bulge}=1$. We examine\nthe distance estimates of some events in detail, and conclude that some\nparallax-based distance estimates could be significantly in error. Only by\ncombining the removal of one problematic event from our sample and the\ninclusion of strong dependences of planet abundance or detection sensitivity on\nhost mass, metallicity and event timescale are we able to find consistency with\nthe hypothesis that the bulge and disk have equal planet abundance.\n", "  Our aim is to devise a detection method for exoplanet signatures (multiple\nsinusoids) that is both powerful and robust to partially unknown statistics\nunder the null hypothesis. In the considered application, the noise is mostly\ncreated by the stellar atmosphere, with statistics depending on the complicated\ninterplay of several parameters. Recent progresses in hydrodynamic (HD)\nsimulations show however that realistic stellar noise realizations can be\nnumerically produced off-line by astrophysicists. We propose a detection method\nthat is calibrated by HD simulations and analyze its performances. A comparison\nof the theoretical results with simulations on synthetic and real data shows\nthat the proposed method is powerful and robust.\n", "  We theoretically investigate how one can achieve a preferred rotational\ndirection for the case of a simple electrostatic motor. The motor is composed\nby a rotor and two electronic reservoirs. Electronic islands on the rotor can\nexchange electrons with the reservoirs. An electrostatic field exerts a force\non the occupied islands. The charge dynamics and the electrostatic field drive\nrotations of the rotor. Coupling to an environment lead to damping on the\nrotational degree of freedom. We use two different approaches to the charge\ndynamics in the electronic islands: hopping process and mean-field. The hopping\nprocess approach takes into account charge fluctuations, which can appear along\nCoulomb blockade effects in nanoscale systems. The mean-field approach neglects\nthe charge fluctuations on the islands, which is typically suitable for larger\nsystems. We show that for a system described by the mean-field equations one\ncan in principle prepare initial conditions to obtain a desired rotational\ndirection. In contrast, this is not possible in the stochastic description.\nHowever, for both cases one can achieve rotational directionality by changing\nthe geometry of the rotor. By scanning the space formed by the relevant\ngeometric parameters we find optimal geometries, while fixing the dissipation\nand driving parameters. Remarkably, in the hopping process approach perfect\nrotational directionality is possible for a large range of geometries.\n", "  Power density constraints are limiting the performance improvements of modern\nCPUs. To address this we have seen the introduction of lower-power, multi-core\nprocessors such as GPGPU, ARM and Intel MIC. To stay within the power density\nlimits but still obtain Moore's Law performance/price gains, it will be\nnecessary to parallelize algorithms to exploit larger numbers of lightweight\ncores and specialized functions like large vector units. Track finding and\nfitting is one of the most computationally challenging problems for event\nreconstruction in particle physics. At the High-Luminosity Large Hadron\nCollider (HL-LHC), for example, this will be by far the dominant problem. The\nneed for greater parallelism has driven investigations of very different track\nfinding techniques such as Cellular Automata or Hough Transforms. The most\ncommon track finding techniques in use today, however, are those based on the\nKalman Filter. Significant experience has been accumulated with these\ntechniques on real tracking detector systems, both in the trigger and offline.\nThey are known to provide high physics performance, are robust, and are in use\ntoday at the LHC. We report on porting these algorithms to new parallel\narchitectures. Our previous investigations showed that, using optimized data\nstructures, track fitting with Kalman Filter can achieve large speedups both\nwith Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi. We report here our progress towards an end-to-end\ntrack reconstruction algorithm fully exploiting vectorization and\nparallelization techniques in a realistic experimental environment.\n", "  Current measurements of the Higgs boson mass and top Yukawa coupling suggest\nthat the effective Higgs potential develops an instability below the Planck\nscale. If the energy scale of inflation is as high as the GUT scale,\ninflationary quantum fluctuations of the Higgs field can easily destabilize the\nstandard electroweak vacuum and produce a lot of AdS domains. This\ndestabilization during inflation can be avoided if a relatively large\nnonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling is introduced. Such\ncouplings generate a large effective mass term for the Higgs, which can raise\nthe effective Higgs potential and suppress the vacuum fluctuation of the Higgs\nfield. After primordial inflation, however, such effective masses drops rapidly\nand the nonminimal Higgs-gravity or inflaton-Higgs coupling can cause large\nfluctuations of the Higgs field to be generated via parametric resonance, thus\nproducing AdS domains in the preheating stage. Furthermore, thermal\nfluctuations of the Higgs field cannot be neglected in the proceeding reheating\nepoch. We discuss the Higgs vacuum fluctuations during inflation, preheating,\nand reheating, and show that the Higgs metastability problem is severe unless\nthe energy scale of the inflaton potential is much lower than the GUT scale.\n", "  Nucleation processes of mixed-phase states are an intrinsic characteristic of\nfirst-order phase transitions, typically related to local symmetry breaking.\nDirect observation of emerging mixed-phase regions in materials showing a\nfirst-order metal-insulator transition (MIT) offers unique opportunities to\nuncover their driving mechanism. Using photoemission electron microscopy, we\nimage the nanoscale formation and growth of insulating domains across the\ntemperature-driven MIT in NdNiO3 epitaxial thin films. Heteroepitaxy is found\nto strongly determine the nanoscale nature of the phase transition, inducing\npreferential formation of striped domains along the terraces of atomically flat\nstepped surfaces. We show that the distribution of transition temperatures is\nan intrinsic local property, set by surface morphology and stable across\nmultiple temperature cycles. Our data provides new insights into the MIT of\nheteroepitaxial nickelates and points to a rich, nanoscale phenomenology in\nthis strongly correlated material.\n", "  Far-infrared and terahertz spectroscopy of ferroelectric soft and central\nmodes in thin films on substrates is reviewed. In addition to classical\ndisplacive proper ferroelectrics, also incipient and relaxor ferroelectrics and\nmultiferroics are discussed. Special attention is paid to differences between\nthe soft-mode behavior in thin films and bulk materials (ceramics and single\ncrystals) and their influence on the low-frequency permittivity. Particularly\nthe effects of the thin film strains and depolarizing electric fields of the\nprobing waves on the grain boundaries are emphasized. The soft-mode\nspectroscopy is shown to be a very sensitive tool to reveal the thin film\nquality.\n", "  This paper is concerned with quantum harmonic oscillators consisting of a\nquantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer. We employ\ndiscounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted\ntime averages of second-order moments of the system variables. A coherent\nquantum filtering (CQF) problem is formulated as the minimization of the\ndiscounted mean square of an estimation error, with which the dynamic variables\nof the observer approximate those of the plant. The cost functional also\ninvolves a quadratic penalty on the plant-observer coupling matrix in order to\nmitigate the back-action of the observer on the covariance dynamics of the\nplant. For the discounted mean square optimal CQF problem with penalized\nback-action, we establish first-order necessary conditions of optimality in the\nform of algebraic matrix equations. By using the Hamiltonian structure of the\nHeisenberg dynamics and related Lie-algebraic techniques, we represent this set\nof equations in a more explicit form in the case of equally dimensioned plant\nand observer.\n", "  Magneto-acoustic tomography combines near-field radio-frequency (RF) and\nultrasound with the aim of creating a safe, high resolution, high contrast\nhybrid imaging technique. We present continuous-wave magneto-acoustic imaging\ntechniques, which improve SNR and/or reduce the required peak-to-average\nexcitation power ratio, to make further integration and larger fields of view\nfeasible. This method relies on the coherency between RF excitation and the\nresulting ultrasound generated through Lorentz force interactions, which was\nconfirmed by our previous work. We provide detailed methodology, clarify the\ndetails of experiments, and explain how the presence of magneto-acoustic\nphenomenon was verified. An example magneto-acoustic B-scan image is acquired\nin order to illustrate the capability of magneto-acoustic tomography in\nhighlighting boundaries where electrical conductivity alters, such as between\ndifferent tissues.\n", "  Quantification of human movement is a challenge in many areas, ranging from\nphysical therapy to robotics. We quantify of human movement for the purpose of\nproviding automated exercise coaching in the home. We developed a model-based\nassessment and inference process that combines biomechanical constraints with\nmovement assessment based on the Microsoft Kinect camera. To illustrate the\napproach, we quantify the performance of a simple squatting exercise using two\nmodel-based metrics that are related to strength and endurance, and provide an\nestimate of the strength and energy-expenditure of each exercise session. We\nlook at data for 5 subjects, and show that for some subjects the metrics\nindicate a trend consistent with improved exercise performance.\n", "  The nature of gravitational waves in a generalized gravitation theory is\ninvestigated. The linearized field equations and the metric tensor quadrupole\nmoment power and the decrease in radius of an inspiralling binary system of two\ncompact objects are derived. The generalized Kerr metric describing a spinning\nblack hole is determined by its mass $M$ and the spin parameter $a=cS/GM^2$.\nThe LIGO-Virgo collaboration data is fitted with smaller binary black hole\nmasses in agreement with the current electromagnetic, observed X-ray binary\nupper bound for a black hole mass, $M\\lesssim 10M_\\odot$.\n", "  Sources of uncertainty are reviewed for calculated atomic and molecular data\nthat are important for plasma modeling: atomic and molecular structure and\ncross sections for electron-atom, electron-molecule, and heavy particle\ncollisions. We concentrate on model uncertainties due to approximations to the\nfundamental many-body quantum mechanical equations and we aim to provide\nguidelines to estimate uncertainties as a routine part of computations of data\nfor structure and scattering.\n", "  Micromechanically exfoliated mono- and multilayers of molybdenum disulfide\n(MoS2) are investigated by spectroscopic imaging ellipsometry. In combination\nwith knife edge illumination, MoS2 flakes can be detected and classified on\narbitrary flat and also transparent substrates with a lateral resolution down\nto 1 to 2 um. The complex dielectric functions from mono- and trilayer MoS2 are\npresented. They are extracted from a multilayer model to fit the measured\nellipsometric angles employing an anisotropic and an isotropic fit approach. We\nfind that the energies of the critical points of the optical constants can be\ntreated to be independent of the utilized model, whereas the magnitude of the\noptical constants varies with the used model. The anisotropic model suggests a\nmaximum absorbance for a MoS2 sheet supported by sapphire of about 14 % for\nmonolayer and of 10 % for trilayer MoS2. Furthermore, the lateral homogeneity\nof the complex dielectric function for monolayer MoS2 is investigated with a\nspatial resolution of 2 um. Only minor fluctuations are observed. No evidence\nfor strain, for a significant amount of disorder or lattice defects can be\nfound in the wrinkle-free regions of the MoS2 monolayer from complementary\nRaman spectroscopy measurements. We assume that the minor lateral variation in\nthe optical constants are caused by lateral modification in the van der Waals\ninteraction presumably caused by the preparation using micromechanical\nexfoliation and viscoelastic stamping.\n", "  We address the importance of the modern theory of orbital magnetization for\nspintronics. Based on an all-electron first-principles approach, we demonstrate\nthat the predictive power of the routinely employed \"atom-centered\"\napproximation is limited to materials like elemental bulk ferromagnets, while\nthe application of the modern theory of orbital magnetization is crucial in\nchemically or structurally inhomogeneous systems such as magnetic thin films,\nand materials exhibiting non-trivial topology in reciprocal and real\nspace,~e.g.,~Chern insulators or non-collinear systems. We find that the modern\ntheory is particularly crucial for describing magnetism in a class of materials\nthat we suggest here $-$ topological orbital ferromagnets.\n", "  In this article we review the thermoelectric properties of three terminal\ndevices with Coulomb coupled quantum dots (QDs) as observed in recent\nexperiments [1,2]. The system we consider consists of two Coulomb-blockade QDs\none of which can exchange electrons with only a single reservoir (heat\nreservoir) while the other dot is tunnel coupled to two reservoirs at a lower\ntemperature (conductor). The heat reservoir and the conductor interact only via\nthe Coulomb-coupling of the quantum dots. It has been found that two regimes\nhave to be considered. In the first one heat flow between the two systems is\nsmall. In this regime thermally driven occupation fluctuations of the hot QD\nmodify the transport properties of the conductor system. This leads to an\neffect called thermal gating. Experiment have shown how this can be used to\ncontrol charge flow in the conductor by means of temperature in a remote\nreservoir. We further substantiate the observations with model calculations and\nimplications for the realization of an all-thermal transistor are discussed. In\nthe second regime, heat flow between the two systems is relevant. Here the\nsystem works as a nano scale heat engine, as proposed recently [3]. We review\nthe conceptual idea, its experimental realization and the novel features\narising in this new kind of thermoelectric device such as decoupling of heat\nand charge flow.\n", "  Recently, two groups have made distinct proposals for a de Sitter space that\nis emergent from conformal field theory (CFT). The first proposal is that, for\ntwo-dimensional holographic CFTs, the kinematic space of geodesics on a\nspacelike slice of the asymptotically anti-de Sitter bulk is two-dimensional de\nSitter space (dS$_2$), with a metric that can be derived from the entanglement\nentropy of intervals in the CFT. In the second proposal, de Sitter dynamics\nemerges naturally from the first law of entanglement entropy for perturbations\naround the vacuum state of CFTs. We provide support for the equivalence of\nthese two emergent spacetimes in the vacuum case and beyond. In particular, we\nstudy the kinematic spaces of nontrivial solutions of $3$d gravity, including\nthe BTZ black string, BTZ black hole, and conical singularities. We argue that\nthe resulting spaces are generically globally hyperbolic spacetimes that\nsupport dynamics given boundary conditions at future infinity. For the BTZ\nblack string, corresponding to a thermal state of the CFT, we show that both\nprescriptions lead to an emergent hyperbolic patch of dS$_2$. We offer a\ngeneral method for relating kinematic space and the auxiliary de Sitter space\nthat is valid in the vacuum and thermal cases.\n", "  Ultracold atomic gases have recently become a driving force in few-body\nphysics due to the observation of the Efimov effect. While initially observed\nin equal mass systems, one expects even richer few-body physics in the\nheteronuclear case. In previous experiments with ultracold mixtures of\npotassium and rubidium, an unexpected non-universal behavior of Efimov\nresonances was observed. In contrast, we measure the scattering length\ndependent three-body recombination coefficient in ultracold heteronuclear\nmixtures of $^{39}\\mathrm{K}$-\\87Rb and $^{41}\\mathrm{K}$-\\87Rb and do not\nobserve any signatures of Efimov resonances for accessible scattering lengths\nin either mixture. Our results show good agreement with our theoretical model\nfor the scattering dependent three-body recombination coefficient and\nreestablish universality across isotopic mixtures.\n", "  We study the norm approximation to the Schr\\\"odinger dynamics of $N$ bosons\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with an interaction potential of the form\n$N^{3\\beta-1}w(N^{\\beta}(x-y))$. Assuming that in the initial state the\nparticles outside of the condensate form a quasi-free state with finite kinetic\nenergy, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the fluctuations around the\ncondensate can be effectively described using Bogoliubov approximation for all\n$0\\le \\beta<1/2$. The range of $\\beta$ is expected to be optimal for this large\nclass of initial states.\n", "  We describe a symmetron model in which the screening of fifth forces arises\nat the one-loop level through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. We show that such a theory can avoid current constraints on\nthe existence of fifth forces but still has the potential to give rise to\nobservable deviations from general relativity, which could be seen in cold atom\nexperiments.\n", "  We present results of the final Kepler Data Processing Pipeline search for\ntransiting planet signals in the full 17-quarter primary mission data set. The\nsearch includes a total of 198,709 stellar targets, of which 112,046 were\nobserved in all 17 quarters and 86,663 in fewer than 17 quarters. We report on\n17,230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that\nmeets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed\ntransit events, detection statistic (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) in excess of\nthe search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit\nconsistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are\niteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting\nplanet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search\nfor additional planets adds 16,802 transit signals for a total of 34,032; this\nfar exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs.\nThere was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final\nKepler transit search. A comparison of the transit signals against a set of\n3402 well-established, high-quality Kepler Objects of Interest yields a\nrecovery rate of 99.8%. The high recovery rate must be weighed against a large\nnumber of false-alarm detections. We examine characteristics of the planet\npopulation implied by the transiting planet model fits with an emphasis on\ndetections that would represent small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of\ntheir host stars.\n", "  Lattice models, also known as generalized Ising models or cluster expansions,\nare widely used in many areas of science and are routinely applied to alloy\nthermodynamics, solid-solid phase transitions, magnetic and thermal properties\nof solids, and fluid mechanics, among others. However, the problem of finding\nthe true global ground state of a lattice model, which is essential for all of\nthe aforementioned applications, has remained unresolved, with only a limited\nnumber of results for highly simplified systems known. In this article, we\npresent the first general algorithm to find the exact ground states of complex\nlattice models and to prove their global optimality, resolving this fundamental\nproblem in condensed matter and materials theory. We transform the\ninfinite-discrete-optimization problem into a pair of combinatorial\noptimization (MAX-SAT) and non-smooth convex optimization (MAX-MIN) problems,\nwhich provide upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy respectively.\nBy systematically converging these bounds to each other, we find and prove the\nexact ground state of realistic Hamiltonians whose solutions are completely\nintractable via traditional methods. Considering that currently such\nHamiltonians are solved using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms that\nare often unable to find the true global energy minimum, and never able to\nprove the optimality of their result, our work opens the door to resolving\nlong-standing uncertainties in lattice models of physical phenomena.\n", "  First and second laws of black hole thermodynamics are examined at the\napparent horizon of FRW spacetime in $f(R,R_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta}\n,\\phi)$ gravity, where $R$, $R_{\\alpha\\beta}R^{\\alpha\\beta}$ and $\\phi$ are the\nRicci scalar, Ricci invariant and the scalar field respectively. In this\nmodified theory, Friedmann equations are formulated for any spatial curvature.\nThese equations can be presented into the form of first law of thermodynamics\nfor $T_{h}d\\hat{S}_{h}+ T_{h}d_{i}\\hat{S}_{h}+W dV=dE$, where\n$d_{i}\\hat{S}_{h}$ is an extra entropy term because of the non-equilibrium\npresentation of the equations and $T_{h}d\\hat{S}_{h}+W dV=dE$ for the\nequilibrium presentation. The generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT)\nis expressed in an inclusive form where these results can be represented in GR\n$f(R)$ and $f(R, \\phi)$ gravities. Finally to check the validity of GSLT, we\ntake some particular models and produce constraints of the parameters.\n", "  The purpose of this article is to review the current status of a frontier in\ndynamic spintronics and contemporary magnetism, in which much progress has been\nmade in the past decade, based on the creation of a variety of micro- and\nnano-structured devices that enable electrical detection of magnetization\ndynamics. The primary focus is on the physics of spin rectification effects,\nwhich are well suited for studying magnetization dynamics and spin transport in\na variety of magnetic materials and spintronic devices. Intended to be\nintelligible to a broad audience, the paper begins with a pedagogical\nintroduction, comparing the methods of electrical detection of charge and spin\ndynamics in semiconductors and magnetic materials respectively. After that it\nprovides a comprehensive account of the theoretical study of both the angular\ndependence and line shape of electrically detected ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR), which is summarized in a handbook formate easy to be used for analyzing\nexperimental data. We then review and examine the similarity and differences of\nvarious spin rectification effects found in ferromagnetic films, magnetic\nbilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions, including a discussion of how to\nproperly distinguish spin rectification from the spin pumping/inverse spin Hall\neffect generated voltage. After this we review the broad applications of\nrectification effects for studying spin waves, nonlinear dynamics, domain wall\ndynamics, spin current, and microwave imaging. We also discuss spin\nrectification in ferromagnetic semiconductors. The paper concludes with both\nhistorical and future perspectives, by summarizing and comparing three\ngenerations of FMR spectroscopy which have been developed for studying\nmagnetization dynamics.\n", "  We report ab initio calculations of the dielectric function of six mono- and\nbilayer molybdenum dichalcogenides based in a Bethe Salpether\nequation+G$_0$W$_0$ ansatz, focussing on the excitonic transitions dominating\nthe absorption spectrum up to an excitation energy of 3\\,eV. Our calculations\nsuggest that switching chalcogen atoms and the strength of interlayer\ninteractions should affect the detailed composition of the high 'C' peaks in\nexperimental optical spectra of molybdenum dichalcogenides and cause a\nsignificant spin-orbit-splitting of the contributing excitonic transitions in\nmonolayer MoSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$. This can be explained through changes in the\nelectronic dispersion around the Fermi energy along the chalcogen series\nS$\\rightarrow$Se$\\rightarrow$Te that move the van-Hove singularities in the\ndensity of states of the two-dimensional materials along the\n\\textit{$\\Gamma$}-\\textit{K} line in the Brillouin zone. Further, we confirm\nthe distinct interlayer character of the '\\textsl{C}' peak transition in\nfew-layer MoS$_2$ that was predicted before from experimental data and show\nthat a similar behaviour can be expected for MoSe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ as well.\n", "  The problem of finding code distance has been long studied for the generic\nensembles of linear codes and led to several algorithms that substantially\nreduce exponential complexity of this task. However, no asymptotic complexity\nbounds are known for distance verification in other ensembles of linear codes.\nOur goal is to re-design the existing generic algorithms of distance\nverification and derive their complexity for LDPC codes. We obtain new\ncomplexity bounds with provable performance expressed in terms of the\nerasure-correcting thresholds of long LDPC codes. These bounds exponentially\nreduce complexity estimates known for linear codes.\n", "  Irradiation of a sharp tungsten tip by a femtosecond laser and exposed to a\nstrong DC electric field led to gradual and reproducible surface modifications.\nBy a combination of field emission microscopy and scanning electron microscopy,\nwe observed asymmetric surface faceting with sub-ten nanometer high steps. The\npresence of well pronounced faceted features mainly on the laser-exposed side\nimplies that the surface modification was driven by a laser-induced transient\ntemperature rise -- on a scale of a couple of picoseconds -- in the tungsten\ntip apex. Moreover, we identified the formation of a nano-tip a few nanometers\nhigh located at one of the corners of a faceted plateau. The results of\nsimulations emulating the experimental conditions, are consistent with the\nexperimental observations. The presented conditions can be used as a new method\nto fabricate nano-tips of few nm height, which can be used in coherent electron\npulses generation. Besides the direct practical application, the results also\nprovide insight into the microscopic mechanisms of light-matter interaction.\nThe apparent growth mechanism of the features may also help to explain the\norigin of enhanced electron field emission, which leads to vacuum arcs, in high\nelectric-field devices such as radio-frequency particle accelerators.\n", "  Measurements of the per-event charged-particle yield as a function of the\ncharged-particle transverse momentum and rapidity are performed using $p+$Pb\ncollision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. Charged particles are reconstructed over\npseudorapidity $|\\eta|<2.3$ and transverse momentum between $0.1$ GeV and $22$\nGeV in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $1$ $\\mu b^{-1}$.\nThe results are presented in the form of charged-particle nuclear modification\nfactors, where the $p+$Pb charged-particle multiplicities are compared between\ncentral and peripheral $p+$Pb collisions as well as to charged-particle cross\nsections measured in pp collisions. The $p+$Pb collision centrality is\ncharacterized by the total transverse energy measured in $-4.9<\\eta<-3.1$,\nwhich is in the direction of the outgoing lead beam. Three different\nestimations of the number of nucleons participating in the $p+$Pb collision are\ncarried out using the Glauber model and two Glauber-Gribov colour-fluctuation\nextensions to the Glauber model. The values of the nuclear modification factors\nare found to vary significantly as a function of rapidity and transverse\nmomentum. A broad peak is observed for all centralities and rapidities in the\nnuclear modification factors for charged-particle transverse momentum values\naround $3$ GeV. The magnitude of the peak increases for more central collisions\nas well as rapidity ranges closer to the direction of the outgoing lead\nnucleus.\n", "  In calculating one-loop contributions to amplitudes of the lepton-flavor\nviolating decays of the neutral Higgses (LFVHD) to different flavor charged\nleptons, the analytic expressions can be written in term of Passarino-Veltman\nfunctions. Then, they can be computed numerically by Looptools [1]. Another\napproach is using suitable analytic expressions established for just this\nparticular case. We compare numerical results obtained from Looptools and those\ncomputed by different expressions that have been applied recently. Then we\nderive the preferable ones that are applicable for the large ranges of free\nparameters introduced in the models beyond the Standard Model (SM). For\nillustration, the LFVHD in a simple model, which has been discussed recently,\nwill be investigated more precisely.\n", "  Many partially-successful attempts have been made to find the most natural\ndiscrete-variable version of Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI). We\ndevelop an axiomatic framework from which we deduce the natural form of a\ndiscrete-variable EPI and an associated entropic monotonicity in a\ndiscrete-variable central limit theorem. In this discrete EPI, the geometric\ndistribution, which has the maximum entropy among all discrete distributions\nwith a given mean, assumes a role analogous to the Gaussian distribution in\nShannon's EPI. The entropy power of $X$ is defined as the mean of a geometric\nrandom variable with entropy $H(X)$. The crux of our construction is a\ndiscrete-variable version of Lieb's scaled addition $X \\boxplus_\\eta Y$ of two\ndiscrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with $\\eta \\in (0, 1)$. We discuss the\nrelationship of our discrete EPI with recent work of Yu and Johnson who\ndeveloped an EPI for a restricted class of random variables that have\nultra-log-concave (ULC) distributions. Even though we leave open the proof of\nthe aforesaid natural form of the discrete EPI, we show that this discrete EPI\nholds true for variables with arbitrary discrete distributions when the entropy\npower is redefined as $e^{H(X)}$ in analogy with the continuous version.\nFinally, we show that our conjectured discrete EPI is a special case of the\nyet-unproven Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI), which assumes a role\nanalogous to Shannon's EPI in capacity proofs for Gaussian bosonic (quantum)\nchannels.\n", "  We show that the recently observed suppression of the gap between the broad\nline region (BLR) and the narrow line region (NLR) in some AGN can be fully\nexplained by an increase of the gas density in the emitting region. Our model\npredicts the formation of the intermediate line region (ILR) that is observed\nin some Seyfert galaxies by the detection of emission lines with intermediate\nvelocity full width half maximum (FWHM) $\\sim$ 700 - 1200 km s$^{-1}$. These\nlines are believed to be originating from an ILR located somewhere between the\nBLR and NLR. As it was previously proved, the apparent gap is assumed to be\ncaused by the presence of dust beyond the sublimation radius. Our computations\nwith the use of {\\sc cloudy} photoionization code, show that the differences in\nthe shape of spectral energy distribution (SED) from the central region of AGN,\ndo not diminish the apparent gap in the line emission in those objects. A\nstrong discontinuity in the line emission vs radius exists for all lines at the\ndust sublimation radius. However, increasing the gas density to $\\sim$\n10$^{11.5}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the sublimation radius provides the continuous line\nemission vs radius and fully explains the recently observed lack of apparent\ngap in some AGN. We show that such a high density is consistent with the\ndensity of upper layers of an accretion disk atmosphere. Therefore, the upper\nlayers of the disk atmosphere can give rise to the formation of observed\nemission line clouds.\n", "  This paper is dedicated to the study of interactions between external sources\nfor the electromagnetic field in a Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario. We focus\non a particular higher derivative, Lorentz violating interaction that arises\nfrom a specific model that was argued to lead to interesting effects in the low\nenergy phenomenology of light pseudoscalars interacting with photons. The kind\nof higher derivative Lorentz violating interaction we discuss do not appear in\nthe well known Standard Model Extension, therefore they are called nonminimal.\nThey are usually expected to be relevant only at very high energies, but we\nargue they might also induce relevant effects in low energy phenomena. Special\nattention is given for phenomena that have no counterpart in Maxwell theory.\n", "  In a collinear antiferromagnet with easy-axis anisotropy, symmetry guarantees\nthat the spin wave modes are doubly degenerate. The two modes carry opposite\nspin angular momentum and exhibit opposite chirality. Using a honeycomb\nantiferromagnet in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we\nshow that a longitudinal temperature gradient can drive the two modes to\nopposite transverse directions, realizing a spin Nernst effect of magnons with\nvanishing thermal Hall current. We find that magnons around the {\\Gamma}-point\nand the K-point contribute oppositely to the transverse spin transport, and\ntheir competition leads to a sign change of the spin Nernst coefficient at\nfinite temperature. Possible material candidates are discussed.\n", "  Isospectral transformations of exactly solvable models constitute a fruitful\nmethod for obtaining new structures with prescribed properties. In this paper\nwe study the stability group of the Dirac algebra in honeycomb lattices\nrepresenting graphene or boron nitride. New crystalline arrays with conical\n(Dirac) points are obtained; in particular, a model for dichalcogenide\nmonolayers is proposed and analyzed. In our studies we encounter unitary and\nnon-unitary transformations. We show that the latter give rise to $\\mbox{$\\cal\nP\\,$}\\mbox{$\\cal T\\,$}$-symmetric Hamiltonians, in compliance with known\nresults in the context of boosted Dirac equations. The results of the unitary\npart are applied to the description of invariant bandgaps and dispersion\nrelations in materials such as MoS$_2$. A careful construction based on atomic\norbitals is proposed and the resulting dispersion relation is compared with\nprevious results obtained through DFT.\n", "  We experimentally realize indirect coupling between two cavity modes via\nstrong coupling with the ferromagnetic resonance in Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG).\nWe find that some indirectly coupled modes of our system can have a higher\nmicrowave transmission than the individual uncoupled modes. Using a coupled\nharmonic oscillator model, the influence of the oscillation phase difference\nbetween the two cavity modes on the nature of the indirect coupling is\nrevealed. These indirectly coupled microwave modes can be controlled using an\nexternal magnetic field or by tuning the cavity height. This work has potential\nfor use in controllable optical devices and information processing\ntechnologies.\n", "  We study an one-dimensional transverse field Ising model with additional\nperiodically modulated real and complex fields. It is shown that both models\ncan be mapped on a pseudo spin system in the k space in the aid of an extended\nBogoliubov transformation. This allows us to introduce the geometric quantity,\nthe Chern number, to identify the nature of quantum phases. Based on the exact\nsolution, we find that the spatially modulated real and complex fields\nrearrange the phase boundaries from that of the ordinary Ising model, which can\nbe characterized by the Chern numbers defined in the context of Dirac and\nbiorthonormal inner products, respectively.\n", "  The paper is proposing a possible link between the construction of the\nSilbury Hill, the prehistoric artificial mound near Avebury, and the\nobservation of Alpha Crucis, the main star of the Crux constellation, which was\nslowly disappearing from the local sky due to the precession of the Earth's\naxis. For the discussion, we used simulations of the local astronomical\nlandscape made by means of Stellarium software.\n", "  It was shown recently that Birkhoff's theorem for doubly stochastic matrices\ncan be extended to unitary matrices with equal line sums whenever the dimension\nof the matrices is prime. We prove a generalization of the Birkhoff theorem for\nunitary matrices with equal line sums for arbitrary dimension.\n", "  The result of a search for pair production of the supersymmetric partner of\nthe Standard Model bottom quark ($\\tilde{b}_1$) is reported. The search uses\n3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV collected by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015. Bottom squarks are searched\nfor in events containing large missing transverse momentum and exactly two jets\nidentified as originating from $b$-quarks. No excess above the expected\nStandard Model background yield is observed. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence\nlevel on the mass of the bottom squark are derived in phenomenological\nsupersymmetric $R$-parity-conserving models in which the $\\tilde{b}_1$ is the\nlightest squark and is assumed to decay exclusively via $\\tilde{b}_1\n\\rightarrow b \\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$, where $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ is the lightest\nneutralino. The limits significantly extend previous results; bottom squark\nmasses up to 800 (840) GeV are excluded for the $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ mass below\n360 (100) GeV whilst differences in mass above 100 GeV between the\n$\\tilde{b}_1$ and the $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ are excluded up to a $\\tilde{b}_1$\nmass of 500 GeV.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on the frustrated quantum magnetic compound\nYbMgGaO4, we study an effective spin model on triangular lattice taking into\naccount the effects of the spin-orbit coupling. We determine the classical\nground-state phase diagram of this model, which includes a 120 degree Neel and\ntwo collinear antiferromagnetic phases. In the vicinity of the phase boundary\nbetween the Neel and collinear phases, we identify three intermediate\nnon-collinear antiferromagnetic phases. In each of them the magnetic moments\nare ordered at multiple incommensurate wave vector Q values. We further study\nthe effects of quantum fluctuations in this model via a linear spin-wave\ntheory. We find that the spin excitation gap of the non-collinear multi-Q\nantiferromagnetic state is finite but can be vanishingly small, and this state\nis unstable to a spin liquid phase under strong quantum fluctuations in some\nlarge J_{z+-} regime.\n", "  The existence of satellite galaxy planes poses a major challenge for the\nstandard picture of structure formation with non-baryonic dark matter. Recently\nTully et al. (2015) reported the discovery of two almost parallel planes in the\nnearby Cen A group using mostly high-mass galaxies (M$_B$ $<$ -10 mag) in their\nanalysis. Our team detected a large number of new group member candidates in\nthe Cen A group (M\\\"uller et al. 2016). This dwarf galaxy sample combined with\nother recent results from the literature enables us to test the galaxy\ndistribution in the direction of the Cen A group and to determine the\nstatistical significance of the geometric alignment. Taking advantage of the\nfact that the two galaxy planes lie almost edge-on along the line of sight, the\nnewly found 13 group members by Crnojevic et al. (2014, 2016) and our 16 new\nCen A group candidates (M\\\"uller et al. 2016) can be assigned relative to the\ntwo planes. We use various statistical methods to test whether the distribution\nof galaxies follows a single normal distribution or shows evidence of\nbimodality as it has been reported earlier. We confirm that the data used for\nthe Tully et al. (2015) study support the picture of a bimodal structure.\nHowever, when the new galaxy samples are included, the gap between the two\ngalaxy planes is closing and the significance level of the bimodality is\nreduced. Instead, the plane that contains Cen A becomes more prominent. We\nfound evidence that the galaxy system around Cen A is made up of only one plane\nof satellites. This plane is almost orthogonal to the dust plane of Cen A.\nAccurate distances to the new dwarf galaxies will be required to measure the\nprecise 3D distribution of the galaxies around Cen A.\n", "  We investigate whether the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) low x\nevolution equation is capable to describe the energy dependence of the\nexclusive photo-production cross-section of vector mesons J/Psi and Upsilon on\nprotons. Such cross-sections have been measured by both HERA experiments H1 and\nZEUS in electron-proton collisions and by LHC experiments ALICE, CMS and LHCb\nin ultra-peripheral proton-proton and ultra-peripheral proton-lead collisions.\nOur approach provides a perturbative description of the rise with energy and\nrelies only on a fit of the initial transverse momentum profile of the proton\nimpact factor, which can be extracted from BFKL fits to inclusive HERA data. We\nfind that BFKL evolution is capable to provide a very good description of the\nenergy dependence of the current data set, while the available fits of the\nproton impact factor require an adjustment in the overall normalization.\n", "  The control of the charge state of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond\nis of primary importance for the stabilization of their quantum-optical\nproperties, in applications ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing.\nTo this purpose, in this work current-injecting micro-electrodes were\nfabricated in bulk diamond for NV charge state control. Buried (i.e. 3 {\\mu}m\nin depth) graphitic micro-electrodes with spacing of 9 {\\mu}m were created in\nsingle-crystal diamond substrates by means of a 6 MeV C scanning micro-beam.\nThe high breakdown field of diamond was exploited to electrically control the\nvariation in the relative population of the negative (NV-) and neutral (NV0)\ncharge states of sub-superficial NV centers located in the inter- electrode gap\nregions, without incurring into current discharges. Photoluminescence spectra\nacquired from the biased electrodes exhibited an electrically induced increase\nup to 40% in the NV- population at the expense of the NV0 charge state. The\nvariation in the relative charge state populations showed a linear dependence\nfrom the injected current at applied biases smaller than 250 V, and was\ninterpreted as the result of electron trapping at NV sites, consistently with\nthe Space Charge Limited Current interpretation of the abrupt current increase\nobserved at 300 V bias voltage. In correspondence of such trap-filling-induced\ntransition to a high-current regime, a strong electroluminescent emission from\nthe NV0 centers was observed. In the high-current-injection regime, a decrease\nin the NV- population was observed, in contrast with the results obtained at\nlower bias voltages. These results disclose new possibilities in the electrical\ncontrol of the charge state of NV centers located in the diamond bulk, which\nare characterized by longer spin coherence times.\n", "  We address the characterization of qubit chains and assess the performances\nof local measurements compared to those provided by Feynman probes, i.e.\nnonlocal measurements realized by coupling a single qubit regis- ter to the\nchain. We show that local measurements are suitable to estimate small values of\nthe coupling and that a Bayesian strategy may be successfully exploited to\nachieve optimal precision. For larger values of the coupling Bayesian local\nstrategies do not lead to a consistent estimate. In this regime, Feynman probes\nmay be exploited to build a consistent Bayesian estimator that saturates the\nCram\\'er-Rao bound, thus providing an effective characterization of the chain.\nFinally, we show that ultimate bounds to precision, i.e. saturation of the\nquantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound, may be achieved by a two-step scheme employing\nFeynman probes followed by local measurements.\n", "  We consider the one-band Hubbard model on the square lattice by using\nvariational and Green's function Monte Carlo methods, where the variational\nstates contain Jastrow and backflow correlations on top of an uncorrelated wave\nfunction that includes BCS pairing and magnetic order. At half filling, where\nthe ground state is antiferromagnetically ordered for any value of the on-site\ninteraction $U$, we can identify a hidden critical point $U_{\\rm Mott}$, above\nwhich a finite BCS pairing is stabilized in the wave function. The existence of\nthis point is reminiscent of the Mott transition in the paramagnetic sector and\ndetermines a separation between a Slater insulator (at small values of $U$),\nwhere magnetism induces a potential energy gain, and a Mott insulator (at large\nvalues of $U$), where magnetic correlations drive a kinetic energy gain. Most\nimportantly, the existence of $U_{\\rm Mott}$ has crucial consequences when\ndoping the system: We observe a tendency to phase separation into a hole-rich\nand a hole-poor region only when doping the Slater insulator, while the system\nis uniform by doping the Mott insulator. Superconducting correlations are\nclearly observed above $U_{\\rm Mott}$, leading to the characteristic dome\nstructure in doping. Furthermore, we show that the energy gain due to the\npresence of a finite BCS pairing above $U_{\\rm Mott}$ shifts from the potential\nto the kinetic sector by increasing the value of the Coulomb repulsion.\n", "  We show the emergence of spontaneous synchronization between a pair of\ndetuned quantum oscillators within a harmonic network. Our model does not\ninvolve any nonlinearity, driving, or external dissipation, thus providing the\nsimplest scenario for the occurrence of local coherent dynamics in an extended\nharmonic system. A sufficient condition for synchronization is established by\nbuilding upon the Rayleigh normal mode approach to vibrational systems. Our\nresults show that mechanisms favoring synchronization, even between oscillators\nthat are not directly coupled to each other, are transient energy depletion and\ncrosstalk. We also address the possible buildup of quantum correlations during\nsynchronization and show that indeed entanglement may be generated in detuned\nsystems, starting from uncorrelated states and without any direct coupling\nbetween the two oscillators.\n", "  Microstrip antennas are extensively used in spacecraft systems and other\napplications where they encounter a plasma environment. A detailed\ncomputational investigation of change in antenna radiation properties in the\npresence of plasma has been presented in this paper. The study shows antenna\nproperties such as the resonant frequency, return loss, radiation properties\nand the different characteristics of the antenna changes when it is surrounded\nby plasma. Particular focus of the work is to understand the causes behind\nthese changes by correlating the complex propagation constant in the plasma\nmedium, field distribution on the patch and effective dielectric of the antenna\nsubstrate with antenna parameter variations. The study also provides important\ninsights to explore the possibilities of designing tunable microstrip antenna\nwhere the substrate can be replaced with plasma and important antenna\ncharacteristics can be controlled by varying the plasma density.\n", "  There is growing belief that the next decade will see the emergence of\nsensing devices based on the laws of quantum physics that outperform some of\nour current sensing devices. For example, in frequency estimation, using a\nprobe prepared in an entangled state can, in principle, lead to a precision\ngain compared to a probe prepared in a separable state. Even in the presence of\nsome forms of decoherence, it has been shown that the precision gain can\nincrease with the number of probe particles $N$. Usually, however, the\nentangled and separable state preparation and readout times are assumed to be\nnegligible. We find that a probe in a maximally entangled (GHZ) state can give\nan advantage over a separable state only if the entangled state preparation and\nreadout times are lower than a certain threshold. When the probe system suffers\ndephasing, this threshold is much lower (and more difficult to attain) than it\nis for an isolated probe. Further, we find that in realistic situations the\nmaximally entangled probe gives a precision advantage only up to some finite\nnumber of probe particles $N_\\text{cutoff}$ that is lower for a dephasing probe\nthan it is for an isolated probe.\n", "  Barrett is a Python package for processing and visualising statistical\ninferences made using the nested sampling algorithm MultiNest. The main\ndifferential feature from competitors are full out-of-core processing allowing\nbarrett to handle arbitrarily large datasets. This is achieved by using the\nHDF5 data format.\n", "  We use high-resolution $N$-body simulations to study the effect of a galactic\ndisc on the dynamical evolution of dark matter substructures with orbits and\nstructural parameters extracted from the Aquarius A-2 merger tree (Springel et\nal. 2008). Satellites are modelled as equilibrium $N$-body realizations of\ngeneralized Hernquist profiles with $2\\times10^6$ particles and injected in the\nanalytical evolving host potential at $z_\\mathrm{infall}$, defined by the peak\nof their mass evolution. We select all substructures with\n$M_{200}(z_\\mathrm{infall})\\geq 10^8\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and first pericentric\ndistances $r_p<r_{200}$. Motivated by observations of Milky Way dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies, we also explore satellite models with cored dark matter\nprofiles with a fixed core size $r_c=0.8\\,a_s$ where $a_s$ is the Hernquist\nscale radius. We find that models with cuspy satellites have twice as many\nsurviving substructures at $z=0$ than their cored counterparts, and four times\nas many if we only consider those on orbits with $r_p\\lesssim0.1\\,r_{200}$. For\na given profile, adding an evolving disc potential reduces the number of\nsurviving substructures further by a factor of $\\lesssim2$ for satellites on\norbits that penetrate the disc ($r_p\\lesssim 20\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$). For large\n$r_p$, where tidal forces and the effect of the disc become negligible, the\nnumber of satellites per pericentre bin converges to similar values for all\nfour models.\n", "  Tidal effects have an important impact on the late inspiral of compact binary\nsystems containing neutron stars. Most current models of tidal deformations of\nneutron stars assume that the tidal bulge is directly related to the tidal\nfield generated by the companion, with a constant response coefficient.\nHowever, if the orbital motion approaches a resonance with one of the internal\nmodes of the neutron star, this adiabatic description of tidal effects starts\nto break down, and the tides become dynamical. In this paper, we consider\ndynamical tides in general relativity due to the quadrupolar fundamental\noscillation mode of a neutron star. We devise a description of the effects of\nthe neutron star's finite size on the orbital dynamics based on an effective\npoint-particle action augmented by dynamical quadrupolar degrees of freedom. We\nanalyze the post-Newtonian and test-particle approximations of this model and\nincorporate the results into an effective-one-body Hamiltonian. This enables us\nto extend the description of dynamical tides over the entire inspiral. We\ndemonstrate that dynamical tides give a significant enhancement of matter\neffects compared to adiabatic tides, at least for neutron stars with large\nradii and for low mass-ratio systems, and should therefore be included in\naccurate models for gravitational-wave data analysis.\n", "  Insulating $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids are a phase of matter with bulk\nanyonic quasiparticle excitations and ground state degeneracies on manifolds\nwith non-trivial topology. In this paper, we construct a time-reversal\nsymmetric $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid in two spatial dimensions using an array\nof quantum wires. We identify the anyons as kinks in the appropriate\nLuttinger-liquid description, compute their mutual statistics and construct\nlocal operators that transport these quasiparticles. We also present a\nconstruction of a fractionalized Fermi-liquid (FL*) by coupling the spin sector\nof the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin-liquid to a Fermi-liquid via a Kondo-like coupling.\n", "  Using the Keldysh Green function technique, we calculate the finite-frequency\ncorrelator between the electrical current and the heat current flowing through\na quantum dot connected to reservoirs. At equilibrium, we find that this\nquantity, called mixed noise, is linked to the thermoelectric ac-conductance by\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Out-of-equilibrium, we discuss its\nspectrum and find evidence of the close relationship between the mixed noise\nand the thermopower. We study the spectral coherence and identify the\nconditions to have a strong correlation between the electrical and heat\ncurrents. The change in the spectral coherence due to the presence of a\ntemperature gradient between the reservoirs is also highlighted.\n", "  Short-period Earth to Neptune size exoplanets (super-Earths) with voluminous\ngas envelopes seem to be very common. These gas atmospheres are thought to have\noriginated from the protoplanetary disk in which the planets were embedded\nduring their first few Myr. The accretion rate of gas from the surrounding\nnebula is determined by the ability of the gas to cool and radiate away its\ngravitational energy. Here we demonstrate that heat from the tidal interaction\nbetween the star and the young (and therefore inflated) planet can inhibit the\ngas cooling and accretion. Quantitatively, we find that the growth of\nsuper-Earth atmospheres halts for planets with periods of about 10 days,\nprovided that their initial eccentricities are of the order of 0.2. Thus, tidal\nheating provides a robust and simple mechanism that can simultaneously explain\nwhy these planets did not become gas giants and account for the deficit of\nlow-density planets closer to the star, where the tides are even stronger. We\nsuggest that tidal heating may be as important as other factors (such as the\nnebula's lifetime and atmosphere evaporation) in shaping the observed\nsuper-Earth population.\n", "  Quantum states that can yield work in a cyclical Hamiltonian process form one\nof the primary resources in the context of quantum thermodynamics. Conversely,\nstates whose average energy cannot be lowered by unitary transformations are\ncalled passive. However, while work may be extracted from non-passive states\nusing arbitrary unitaries, the latter may be hard to realize in practice. It is\ntherefore pertinent to consider the passivity of states under restricted\nclasses of operations that can be feasibly implemented. Here, we ask how\nrestrictive the class of Gaussian unitaries is for the task of work extraction.\nWe investigate the notion of Gaussian passivity, that is, we present necessary\nand sufficient criteria identifying all states whose energy cannot be lowered\nby Gaussian unitaries. For all other states we give a prescription for the\nGaussian operations that extract the maximal amount of energy. Finally, we show\nthat the gap between passivity and Gaussian passivity is maximal, i.e.,\nGaussian-passive states may still have a maximal amount of energy that is\nextractable by arbitrary unitaries, even under entropy constraints.\n", "  Complex arithmetic random waves are stationary Gaussian complex-valued\nsolutions of the Helmholtz equation on the two-dimensional flat torus. We use\nWiener-It\\^o chaotic expansions in order to derive a complete characterization\nof the second order high-energy behaviour of the total number of phase\nsingularities of these functions. Our main result is that, while such random\nquantities verify a universal law of large numbers, they also exhibit\nnon-universal and non-central second order fluctuations that are dictated by\nthe arithmetic nature of the underlying spectral measures. Such fluctuations\nare qualitatively consistent with the cancellation phenomena predicted by Berry\n(2002) in the case of complex random waves on compact planar domains. Our\nresults extend to the complex setting recent pathbreaking findings by Rudnick\nand Wigman (2008), Krishnapur, Kurlberg and Wigman (2013) and Marinucci,\nPeccati, Rossi and Wigman (2016). The exact asymptotic characterization of the\nvariance is based on a fine analysis of the Kac-Rice kernel around the origin,\nas well as on a novel use of combinatorial moment formulae for controlling\nlong-range weak correlations.\n", "  We report a search for photon-photon elastic scattering in vacuum in the\nX-ray region at an energy in the center of mass system of \\omega_{cms} =6.5 keV\nfor which the QED cross section is \\sigma_{QED} =2.5 \\times 10^{-47} m^2. An\nX-ray beam provided by the SACLA X-ray Free Electron Laser is split and the two\nbeamlets are made to collide at right angle, with a total integrated luminosity\nof (1.24 \\pm 0.08) \\times 10^{28} m^{-2}. No signal X rays from the elastic\nscattering that satisfy the correlation between energy and scattering angle\nwere detected. We obtain a 95% C.L. upper limit for the scattering cross\nsection of 1.9 \\times 10^{-27} m^2 at \\omega_{cms}=6.5 keV. The upper limit is\nthe lowest upper limit obtained so far by keV experiments.\n", "  Recent progress in two-dimensional superconductors with atomic-scale\nthicknesses is reviewed mainly from the experimental point of view. The\nsuperconducting systems treated here involve a variety of materials and forms:\nelemental-metal ultrathin films and atomic layers on semiconductor surfaces;\ninterfaces and superlattices of heterostructures made of cuprates, perovskite\noxides, and rare-earth metal heavy-fermion compounds; interfaces of\nelectric-double-layer transistors; graphene and atomic sheets of\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide; iron selenide and organic conductors on oxide\nand metal surfaces, respectively. Unique phenomena arising from the ultimate\ntwo-dimensionality of the system and the physics behind them are discussed.\n", "  The merger of two white dwarfs is expected to result in a central fast\nrotating core surrounded by a debris disk, in which magnetorotational\ninstabilities give rise to a hot magnetized corona and a magnetized outflow.\nThe dissipation of magnetic energy via reconnection could lead to the\nacceleration of cosmic-rays in the expanding material, which would result in\nhigh energy neutrinos. We discuss the possibility of using these neutrino\nsignals as probes of the outflow dynamics, magnetic energy dissipation rate and\ncosmic-ray acceleration efficiency. Importantly, the accompanying high-energy\ngamma-rays are absorbed within these sources because of the large optical\ndepth, so these neutrino sources can be regarded as hidden cosmic-ray\naccelerators that are consistent with the non-detection of gamma-rays with\nFermi-LAT. While the cosmic-ray generation rate is highly uncertain, if it\nreaches $\\sim10^{45}\\,\\rm erg\\,Mpc^{-3}\\,yr^{-1}$, the diffuse neutrino flux\ncould contribute a substantial fraction of the IceCube observations. We also\nevaluate the prospect of observing individual merger events, which provides a\nmeans for testing such sources in the future.\n", "  In the first part of the thesis we focus on local symmetries. We review a\nself-consistent framework that we employed in order to discuss the dynamics of\nthe theories of interest. Its merit lies in that we can make the symmetry group\nact internally and thus be effectively separated from coordinate\ntransformations. We investigate under which conditions it is not needed to\nintroduce extra compensating fields to make relativistic as well as\nnonrelativistic theories invariant under local symmetries and more precisely\nunder scale transformations. We clarify the role that torsion plays in this\ncontext. We highlight the difference between Weyl and conformal invariance and\nwe demonstrate that not all conformal theories can be coupled to gravity in a\nWeyl invariant way. Once this minimalistic treatment for gauging symmetries is\nleft aside, new possibilities appear. Namely, if we consider the Poincar\\'e\ngroup, the presence of the extra modes leads to nontrivial particle dynamics.\nWe derive constraints such that the theory is free from pathologies. In the\nsecond part we make clear that even when not gauged, the presence of scale\ninvariance is appealing. First, it makes possible for the dimensionful\nparameters that appear in a theory to be generated dynamically and be sourced\nby the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton. If the Standard Model is\nembedded into a scale-invariant framework, a number of interesting implications\nfor cosmology arise. The inflationary stage of our Universe and its present-day\nacceleration become linked, a connection that might give us insight into the\ndark energy dynamics. We show that in the context of gravitational theories\nwhich are invariant under restricted coordinate transformations, the dilaton\ninstead of being introduced ad hoc, can emerge from the gravitational part of a\ntheory. We discuss the consequences of the nontrivial way this field emerges in\nthe action.\n", "  Topological magnon bands and magnon Hall effect in insulating collinear\nferromagnets are induced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) even at\nzero magnetic field. In the geometrically frustrated star lattice, a\ncoplanar/noncollinear $\\mathbf q=0$ magnetic ordering may be present due to\nspin frustration. This magnetic structure, however, does not exhibit\ntopological magnon effects even with DMI in contrast to collinear ferromagnets.\nWe show that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the star plane induces a\nnon-coplanar spin configuration with nonzero spin scalar chirality, which\nprovides topological effects without the need of DMI. The non-coplanar spin\ntexture originates from the topology of the spin configurations and does not\nneed the presence of DMI or magnetic ordering, which suggests that this\nphenomenon may be present in the chiral spin liquid phases of frustrated\nmagnetic systems. We propose that these anomalous topological magnon effects\ncan be accessible in Polymeric Iron (III) Acetate --- a star-lattice\nantiferromagnet with both spin frustration and long-range magnetic ordering.\n", "  In both research and industrial settings spin coating is extensively used to\nprepare highly uniform thin polymer films. However, under certain conditions,\nspin coating results in films with non-uniform surface morphologies. Although\nthe spin coating process has been extensively studied, the origin of these\nmorphologies is not fully understood and the formation of non-uniform spincast\nfilms remains a practical problem. Here we report on experiments demonstrating\nthat the formation of surface instabilities during spin coating is dependent on\ntemperature. Our results suggest that non-uniform spincast films form as a\nresult of the Marangoni effect, which describes flow due to surface tension\ngradients. We find that both the wavelength and amplitude of the pattern\nincrease with temperature. Finally, and most important from a practical\nviewpoint, the non-uniformities in the film thickness can be entirely avoided\nsimply by lowering the spin coating temperature.\n", "  While batteries offer electronic source and sink in electronic devices,\natomic analogues of source and sink and their theoretical descriptions have\nbeen a challenge in cold-atom systems. Here we consider dynamically emerged\nlocal potentials as controllable source and sink for bosonic atoms. Although a\nsink potential can collect bosons in equlibrium and indicate its usefulness in\nthe adiabatic limit, sudden switching of the potential exhibits low\neffectiveness in pushing bosons into it. This is due to conservation of energy\nand particle in isolated systems such as cold atoms. By varying the potential\ndepth and interaction strength, the systems can further exhibit averse\nresponse, where a deeper emerged potential attracts less bosonic atoms into it.\nTo explore possibilities for improving the effectiveness, we investigate what\ntypes of system-environment coupling can help bring bosons into a dynamically\nemerged sink, and a Lindblad operator corresponding to local cooling is found\nto serve the purpose.\n", "  Using one-dimensional hybrid expanding box model we investigate properties of\nthe solar wind in the outer heliosphere. We assume a proton-electron plasma\nwith a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field and, beside the expansion, we\ntake into account influence of a continuous injection of cold pick-up protons\nthrough the charge-exchange process between the solar wind protons and hydrogen\nof interstellar origin. The injected cold pick-up protons form a ring\ndistribution function that rapidly becomes unstable and generate Alfv\\'en\ncyclotron waves. The Alfv\\'en cyclotron waves scatter pick-up protons to a\nspherical shell distribution function that thickens over that time owing to the\nexpansion-driven cooling. The Alf\\'ven cyclotron waves heat solar wind protons\nin the perpendicular direction (with respect to the ambient magnetic field)\nthrough the cyclotron resonance. At later times, the Alfv\\'en cyclotron waves\nbecome parametrically unstable and the generated ion acoustic waves heat\nprotons in the parallel direction through the Landau resonance. The resulting\nheating of the solar wind protons is efficient on the expansion time scale.\n", "  We report on a soft route towards optical vortex coronagraphy based on\nself-engineered electrically tunable vortex masks based on liquid crystal\ntopological defects. These results suggest that a nature-assisted technological\napproach to the fabrication of complex phase masks could be useful in optical\nimaging whenever optical phase singularities are at play.\n", "  We consider a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory with the gauge group SU(3) broken to\nits center Z(3) by two scalar fields in the adjoint representation and obtain\nnew Z(3) strings asymptotic configurations with the gauge field and magnetic\nfield in the direction of the step operators.\n", "  In this paper we study the smooth moduli space of closed Riemann surfaces.\nThis smooth moduli is an infinite cover of the usual moduli space\n$\\mathscr{M}_g$ of closed Riemann surfaces, and is identified with the Schottky\nspace of rank $g.$ The main theorem of the paper is: Closed Riemann surfaces\nare uniformizable by Schottky groups of Hausdorff dimension less than one. This\nwork seem to be the only paper in literature to study question of Riemann\nsurface uniformization and its Hausdorff dimension. We develop new techniques\nof rational norm of homological marking of Riemann surface and, decomposition\nof probability measures to prove our result. As an application of our theorem\nwe have existence of period matrix of Riemann surface in coordinates of smooth\nmoduli space.\n", "  Evolutions of Geant4 code have affected the simulation of electron\nbackscattering with respect to previously published results. Their effects are\nquantified by analyzing the compatibility of the simulated electron\nbackscattering fraction with a large collection of experimental data for a wide\nset of physics configuration options available in Geant4. Special emphasis is\nplaced on two electron scattering implementations first released in Geant4\nversion 10.2: the Goudsmit-Saunderson multiple scattering model and a single\nCoulomb scattering model based on Mott cross section calculation. The new\nGoudsmit-Saunderson multiple scattering model appears to perform equally or\nless accurately than the model implemented in previous Geant4 versions,\ndepending on the electron energy. The new Coulomb scattering model was flawed\nfrom a physics point of view, but computationally fast in Geant4 version 10.2;\nthe physics correction released in Geant4 version 10.2p01 severely degrades its\ncomputational performance. Evolutions in the Geant4 geometry domain have\naddressed physics problems observed in electron backscattering simulation in\nprevious publications.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers have attracted much\nattention due to their strong light absorption and excellent electronic\nproperties. These advantages make this type of two-dimensional crystal a\npromising one for optoelectronic device applications. In the case of\nphotoelectric conversion devices such as photodetectors and photovoltaic cells,\np-n junctions are one of the most important devices. Here, we demonstrate\nphotodetection with WSe2 monolayer films. We prepare the electrolyte-gated\nambipolar transistors and electrostatic p-n junctions are formed by the\nelectrolyte-gating technique at 270 K. These p-n junctions are cooled down to\nfix the ion motion (and p-n junctions) and we observed the reasonable\nphotocurrent spectra without the external bias, indicating the formation of p-n\njunctions. Very interestingly, two-terminal devices exhibit higher\nphotoresponsivity than that of three-terminal ones, suggesting the formation of\nhighly balanced anion and cation layers. The maximum photoresponsivity reaches\n5 mA/W in resonance with the first excitonic peak. Our technique provides\nimportant evidence for optoelectronics in atomically thin crystals.\n", "  In this paper, the theoretical aspects behind longitudinal RF capture are\nreviewed and the capture process is simulated via a program based on this\ntheory. Four kinds of cases with different initial distribution and capture\ncurve are considered, i.e. uniform distribution with adiabatic capture, uniform\ndistribution with non-adiabatic capture, Gaussian distribution with adiabatic\ncapture and Gaussian distribution with non-adiabatic capture. The simulation\nresults are compared each other and discussed, and Gaussian distribution with\nadiabatic capture is demonstrated having a higher capture efficiency and\nleading to a shorter bunch length. In addition, the BPM induced signal is\nsimulated with high input impendence, i.e. $1M\\Omega$, and low input\nimpendence, i.e. $50\\Omega$, respectively. Finally, the BPM signal of Heavy Ion\nMedical Machine (HIMM) is estimated and compared with measured one, and a good\nagreement is achieved.\n", "  In this paper using the Clifford and spin-Clifford bundles formalism we show\nhow Weyl and Dirac equations formulated in the spin-Clifford bundle may be\nwritten in an equivalent form as generalized Maxwell like form formulated in\nthe Clifford bundle. Moreover, we show how Maxwell equation formulated in the\nClifford bundle formalism can be written as an equivalent equation for a spinor\nfield in the spin-Cillford bundle. Investigating the details of such\nequivalences this exercise shows explicitly that a fermionic field is\nequivalent (in a precise sense) to an equivalence class of well defined boson\nfields and that a bosonic field is equivalent to a well defined equivalence\nclass of fermionic fields These equivalences may be called the bosonization of\nfermionic fields and the fermionization of bosonic fields.\n", "  A lattice Boltzmann scheme associated with flexible Prandtl number and\nspecific heat ratio is proposed, which is based on the polyatomic ellipsoidal\nstatistics model(ES-BGK). The Prandtl number can be modified by a parameter of\nthe Gaussian distribution and the specific heat ratio can be modified by\nadditional free degrees. For the sake of constructing the scheme proposed, the\nGaussian distribution is expanded on the Hermite polynomials and the general\nterm formula for the Hermite coefficients of the Gaussian distribution is\ndeduced. Benchmarks are carried out to verify the scheme proposed. The\nnumerical results are in good agreement with the the analytical solutions.\n", "  In this work, quantum state transfer (QST) over binary-tree spin networks is\nstudied by using advantages of partially collapsing measurements. To this aim,\nwe perform initially a weak measurement (WM) on central qubit of the\nbinary-tree network, which encoding the state of concern and after time\nevolution of the whole system, a quantum measurement reversal (QMR) on the\ndestined qubit is performed. By taking the optimal value of the QMR, it is\nshown that the QST can be improved considerably by controlling the WM strength\nand by choosing it close enough to 1, near-perfect QST can be achieved. We also\nshow that how entanglement distribution quality over the binary-tree spin\nnetwork can be obviously improved by using this approach.\n", "  We consider a field theoretical model where a SU(2) fermion doublet,\nsubjected to non-Abelian gauge interactions, is also coupled to a complex\nscalar field doublet via a Yukawa and an irrelevant Wilson-like term. Despite\nthe presence of these two chiral breaking operators in the Lagrangian, an exact\nsymmetry acting on fermions and scalars prevents perturbative mass corrections.\nIn the phase where fermions are massless (Wigner phase) the Yukawa coupling can\nbe tuned to a critical value at which chiral transformations acting on fermions\nonly become a symmetry of the theory (up to cutoff effects). In the\nNambu-Goldstone phase of the critical theory a fermion mass term of dynamical\norigin is expected to arise in the Ward identities of the purely fermionic\nchiral transformations. Such a non-perturbative mechanism of dynamical mass\ngeneration can provide a \"natural\" (\\`a la 't Hooft) alternative to the Higgs\nmechanism adopted in the Standard Model. Here we lay down the theoretical\nframework necessary to demonstrate the existence of this mechanism by means of\nlattice simulations.\n", "  We provide new formulae for the degenerations of the bilateral basic\nhypergeometric function ${}_1\\psi_1 ( a; b; q, z )$ with using the\n$q$-Borel-Laplace transformation. These are thought of as the first step to\nconstruct connection formulae of $q$-difference equation for ${}_1\\psi_1 ( a;\nb; q, z )$. Moreover, we show that our formulae have the $q \\to 1 - 0$ limit.\n", "  We study the Hadamard finite part of divergent integrals of differential\nforms with singularities on submanifolds. We give formulae for the dependence\nof the finite part on the choice of regularization and express them in terms of\na suitable local residue map. The cases where the submanifold is a complex\nhypersurface in a complex manifold and where it is a boundary component of a\nmanifold with boundary, arising in string perturbation theory, are treated in\nmore detail.\n", "  We discuss the observed deviations in b -> s l+ l- processes from the\nStandard Model predictions and present global fits for the New Physics\ndescription of these anomalies. We further investigate the stability of the\nglobal fits under different theoretical assumptions and suggest strategies and\na number of observables to clear up the source of the anomalies.\n", "  We discuss the prospects for observing CP violation in the MSSM with six\nCP-violating phases, using a geometric approach to maximise CP-violating\nobservables subject to the experimental upper bounds on electric dipole\nmoments. We consider constraints from Higgs physics, flavour physics, the dark\nmatter relic density and spin-independent scattering cross section with matter.\n", "  Memristors have pinched hysteresis loops in the $V-I$ plane. Ideal memristors\nare everywhere non-linear, cross at zero and are rotationally symmetric. In\nthis paper we extend memristor theory to produce different types of\nnon-ideality and find that: including a background current (such as an ionic\ncurrent) moves the crossing point away from zero; including a degradation\nresistance (that increases with experimental time) leads to an asymmetry;\nmodelling a low resistance filament in parallel describes triangular $V-I$\ncurves with a straight-line low resistance state. A novel measurement of\nhysteresis asymmetry was introduced based on hysteresis and it was found that\nwhich lobe was bigger depended on the size of the breaking current relative to\nthe memristance. The hysteresis varied differently with each type of\nnon-ideality, suggesting that measurements of several device I-V curves and\ncalculation of these parameters could give an indication of the underlying\nmechanism.\n", "  Our ability to optically interrogate nanoscopic objects is controlled by the\ndifference between their extinction cross sections and the diffraction limited\narea to which light can be confined in the far field. We show that a partially\ntransmissive spatial mask placed near the back focal plane of a high numerical\naperture microscope objective enhances the extinction contrast of a scatterer\nnear an interface by approximately $T^{-1/2}$, where T is the transmissivity of\nthe mask. Numerical aperture based differentiation of background from scattered\nlight represents a general approach to increasing extinction contrast and\nenables routine label free imaging down to the single molecule level.\n", "  Inverse statistical approaches to determine protein structure and function\nfrom Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are emerging as powerful tools in\ncomputational biology. However the underlying assumptions of the relationship\nbetween the inferred effective Potts Hamiltonian and real protein structure and\nenergetics remain untested so far. Here we use lattice protein model (LP) to\nbenchmark those inverse statistical approaches. We build MSA of highly stable\nsequences in target LP structures, and infer the effective pairwise Potts\nHamiltonians from those MSA. We find that inferred Potts Hamiltonians reproduce\nmany important aspects of 'true' LP structures and energetics. Careful analysis\nreveals that effective pairwise couplings in inferred Potts Hamiltonians depend\nnot only on the energetics of the native structure but also on competing folds;\nin particular, the coupling values reflect both positive design (stabilization\nof native conformation) and negative design (destabilization of competing\nfolds). In addition to providing detailed structural information, the inferred\nPotts models used as protein Hamiltonian for design of new sequences are able\nto generate with high probability completely new sequences with the desired\nfolds, which is not possible using independent-site models. Those are\nremarkable results as the effective LP Hamiltonians used to generate MSA are\nnot simple pairwise models due to the competition between the folds. Our\nfindings elucidate the reasons for the success of inverse approaches to the\nmodelling of proteins from sequence data, and their limitations.\n", "  We apply the topology of convergence on compact sets to define unpredictable\nfunctions [5, 6]. The topology is metrizable and easy for applications with\nintegral operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, the\nexistence and uniqueness of the unpredictable solution for a delay differential\nequation is proved. As a corollary of the theorem, a similar assertion for a\nquasilinear ordinary differential equation is formulated. Examples with\nsimulations illustrate the obtained results.\n", "  We analyze the ergodicity of three one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, with\nharmonic, quartic and Mexican-hat potentials, coupled to the logistic\nthermostat. As criteria for ergodicity we employ: the independence of the\nLyapunov spectrum with respect to initial conditions; the absence of visual\n\"holes\" in two-dimensional Poincar\\'e sections; the agreement between the\nhistograms in each variable and the theoretical marginal distributions; and the\nconvergence of the global joint distribution to the theoretical one, as\nmeasured by the Hellinger distance. Taking a large number of random initial\nconditions, for certain parameter values of the thermostat we find no\nindication of regular trajectories and show that the time distribution\nconverges to the ensemble one for an arbitrarily long trajectory for all the\nsystems considered. Our results thus provide a robust numerical indication that\nthe logistic thermostat can serve as a single one-parameter thermostat for\nstiff one-dimensional systems.\n", "  Predictions for the Standard Model Effective Field Theory at the\nnext-to-leading order accuracy in QCD, including parton-shower effects, have\nstarted to become available in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework. In this talk we\nsummarize some recent results for $t\\bar t$, single top, $t\\bar tZ/\\gamma$, and\n$t\\bar tH$ production channels at dimension six.\n", "  The computation of perturbative corrections to processes involving heavy\nquarks is crucial for the precision program of the LHC and future colliders. In\nthis article, we describe a powerful approach to calculate higher-orders in QCD\nskipping the traditional subtraction method. Our proposal is based on the\nloop-tree duality (LTD) theorem, which allows to rewrite virtual contributions\nin terms of integrals over the real emission phase-space. Then, we proceed to\ncombine both real and virtual contributions at the integrand level, obtaining\nregular expressions that can be numerically integrated in four space-time\ndimensions. In this way, we avoid dealing with complicated massive Feynman\nintegrals and introducing infrared counter-terms. Some reference examples are\nexplained, in order to exhibit the potential of our method.\n", "  A quantitative description of the change in ground-state neutron occupancies\nbetween $^{136}$Xe and $^{136}$Ba, the initial and final state in the\nneutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe, has been extracted from\nprecision measurements of the cross sections of single-neutron adding and\n-removing reactions. Comparisons are made to recent theoretical calculations of\nthe same properties using various nuclear-structure models. These are the same\ncalculations used to determine the magnitude of the nuclear matrix elements for\nthe process, which at present disagree with each other by factors of 2 or 3.\nThe experimental neutron occupancies show some disagreement with the\ntheoretical calculations.\n", "  We report perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic Heusler\nalloy Co$_2$MnGa in a MgO/Co$_2$MnGa/Pd trilayer stack for Co$_2$MnGa\nthicknesses up to 3.5 nm. There is a thickness- and temperature-dependent spin\nreorientation transition from perpendicular to in-plane magnetic anisotropy\nwhich we study through the anomalous Hall effect. From the temperature\ndependence of the anomalous Hall effect, we observe the expected scaling of\n$\\rho_{xy}^{AHE}$ with $\\rho_{xx}$, suggesting the intrinsic and side-jump\nmechanisms are largely responsible for the anomalous Hall effect in this\nmaterial.\n", "  The development of dielectric materials with colossal permittivity is\nimportant for the miniaturization of electronic devices and fabrication of\nhigh-density energy-storage devices. The electron-pinned defect-dipoles has\nbeen recently proposed to boost the permittivity of (Nb + In) co-doped TiO2 to\n105. However, the follow-up studies suggest an extrinsic contribution to the\ncolossal permittivity from thermally excited carriers. Herein, we demonstrate a\nmarked enhancement in the permittivity of (Nb + In) co-doped TiO2 single\ncrystals at sufficiently low temperatures such that the thermally excited\ncarriers are frozen out and exert no influence on the dielectric response. The\nresults indicate that the permittivity attains quadruple of that for pure TiO2.\nThis finding suggests that the electron-pinned defect-dipoles add an extra\ndielectric response to that of the TiO2 host matrix. The results offer a novel\napproach for the development of functional dielectric materials with large\npermittivity by engineering complex defects into bulk materials.\n", "  We evaluate the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux including nuclear correction\nand $B$ hadron contribution in the different frameworks: NLO perturbative QCD\nand dipole models. The nuclear effect is larger in the prompt neutrino flux\nthan in the total charm production cross section, and it reduces the fluxes by\n$10\\% - 30\\%$ depending on the model. We also investigate the uncertainty using\nthe QCD scales allowed by the charm cross section data from RHIC and LHC\nexperiments.\n", "  Epoxy polymers are an important class of material for use in various\napplications. Due to their hydrophilic nature, epoxy resins tend to absorb\nmoisture. Absorption of moisture degrades the functional, structural and\nmechanical properties. For polymers, it is known that moisture absorption can\nlead to both reversible and irreversible changes. In this study, the combined\neffect of moisture and elevated temperature on the mechanical properties of\nEpon 862 and its nanocomposites were investigated. The extent of permanent\ndamage on fracture toughness and flexural properties of epoxy, due to the\naggressive degradation provided by hygrothermal ageing, was determined by\ndrying the epoxy and their clay/epoxy nanocomposites after moisture absorption.\nFrom the investigation it was found that, hygrothermal ageing has detrimental\neffect on mechanical properties of both neat polymer and clay/polymer\nnanocomposite. Significant permanent damage was observed for fracture toughness\nand modulus, while the extent of permanent damage was less significant for\nflexural strength.\n", "  Local community detection, the problem of identifying a set of relevant nodes\nnearby a small set of input seed nodes, is an important graph primitive with a\nwealth of applications and research activity. Recent approaches include using\nlocal spectral information, graph diffusions, and random walks to determine a\ncommunity from input seeds. As networks grow to billions of nodes and exhibit\ndiverse structures, it is important that community detection algorithms are not\nonly efficient, but also robust to different structural features.\n  Toward this goal, we explore pre-processing techniques and modifications to\nexisting local methods aimed at improving the scalability and robustness of\nalgorithms related to community detection. Experiments show that our\nmodifications improve both speed and quality of existing methods for locating\nground truth communities, and are more robust across graphs and communities of\nvarying sizes, densities, and diameters. Our subgraph extraction method uses\nadaptively selected PageRank parameters to improve on the recall and runtime of\na walk-based pre-processing technique of Li et al. for extracting subgraphs\nbefore searching for a community. We then use this technique to enable the\nfirst scalable implementation of the recent Local Fiedler method of Mahoney et\nal. Our experimental evaluation shows our pre-processed version of Local\nFiedler, as well as our novel simplification of the LEMON community detection\nframework of Li et al., offer significant speedups over their predecessors and\nobtain cluster quality competitive with the state of the art.\n", "  Given any equivariant coherent sheaf $\\mathcal L$ on a compact semi-positive\ntoric orbifold $\\mathcal X$, its SYZ T-dual mirror dual is a Lagrangian brane\nin the Landau-Ginzburg mirror. We prove the oscillatory integral of the\nequivariant superpotential in the Landau Ginzburg mirror over this Lagrangian\nbrane is the genus-zero $1$-descendant Gromov-Witten potential with a\nGamma-type class of $\\mathcal L$ inserted.\n", "  Nanodiamonds are of interest as nontoxic substrates for targeted drug\ndelivery and as highly biostable fluorescent markers for cellular tracking.\nBeyond optical techniques however, options for noninvasive imaging of\nnanodiamonds in vivo are severely limited. Here, we demonstrate that the\nOverhauser effect, a proton-electron double resonance technique developed to\ndetect free radicals in vivo, can enable high contrast magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) of nanodiamonds in water at room temperature and ultra-low\nmagnetic field. The technique transfers spin polarization from paramagnetic\nimpurities at nanodiamond surfaces to $^1$H spins in the surrounding water\nsolution, creating MRI contrast on-demand. We further examine the conditions\nrequired for maximum enhancement as well as the ultimate sensitivity of the\ntechnique. The ability to perform continuous hyperpolarization via the\nOverhauser mechanism, in combination with excellent in vivo stability, raises\nthe possibility of performing noninvasive tracking of nanodiamonds over\nindefinitely long periods of time.\n", "  We propose a new parameterization to measure the neutrino mass hierarchy,\nnamely $\\Delta=(m_3-m_1)/(m_1+m_3)$ which is dimensionless and varies in the\nrange $[-1,1]$. Taking into account the results of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments, $\\Delta$ is the unique parameter for determining all the masses of\nneutrinos, and a positive (negative) sign of $\\Delta$ denotes the normal\n(inverted) mass hierarchy. Adopting the currently available cosmic\nobservations, we find that the normal mass hierarchy is slightly favored, and\nthe mass of lightest neutrino is less than $0.030$ eV for the normal mass\nhierarchy and $0.024$ eV for the inverted mass hierarchy at $95\\%$ confidence\nlevel.\n", "  The coupling of charge carrier motion and pseudospin via chirality for\nmassless Dirac fermions in monolayer graphene has generated dramatic\nconsequences, such as the unusual quantum Hall effect and Klein tunneling. In\nbilayer graphene, charge carriers are massive Dirac fermions with a finite\ndensity of states at zero energy. Because of their non-relativistic nature,\nmassive Dirac fermions can provide an even better test bed with which to\nclarify the importance of chirality in transport measurement than massless\nDirac fermions in monolayer graphene. Here, we report an electronic cloaking\neffect as a manifestation of chirality by probing phase coherent transport in\nchemical-vapor-deposited bilayer graphene. Conductance oscillations with\ndifferent periodicities were observed on extremely narrow bilayer graphene\nheterojunctions through electrostatic gating. Using a Fourier analysis\ntechnique, we identified the origin of each individual interference pattern.\nImportantly, the electron waves on the two sides of the potential barrier can\nbe coupled through the evanescent waves inside the barrier, making the confined\nstates underneath the barrier invisible to electrons. These findings provide\ndirect evidence for the electronic cloaking effect and hold promise for the\nrealization of pseudospintronics based on bilayer graphene.\n", "  Calibration issues associated to scrambled collateral smear affecting the\nKepler short-cadence data were discovered in the Data Release 24 and were found\nto be present in all the previous data releases since launch. In consequence, a\nnew Data Release 25 was reprocessed to correct for these problems. We perform\nhere a preliminary study to evaluate the impact on the extracted global seismic\nand background parameters between data releases. We analyze the sample of\nseismic solar analogs observed by Kepler in short cadence between Q5 and Q17.\nWe start with this set of stars as it constitutes the best sample to put the\nSun into context along its evolution, and any significant differences on the\nseismic and background parameters need to be investigated before any further\nstudies of this sample can take place. We use the A2Z pipeline to derive both\nglobal seismic parameters and background parameters from the Data Release 25\nand previous data releases and report on the measured differences.\n", "  Hyperdoped metastable sulfur atoms endow crystalline silicon with a strong\nsub-bandgap light absorption. In order to explore such metastable states, we\ndevelop a new high-throughput first-principles calculation method to search for\nall of the energetically metastable states for an interstitial sulfur atom\ninside crystalline silicon. Finally, we obtain sixty-three metastable\ninterstitial states and they can be classified into ten types. Interestingly,\ntwenty-eight (44% in total) of lower-energy metastable states can produce a\nwell-isolated and half-filled intermediate band (IB) inside silicon forbidden\ngap, which makes sulfur hyperdoped silicon to be a desirable material for IB\nsolar cells.\n", "  We report low frequency observations of the quasi-periodic, circularly\npolarized, harmonic type III radio bursts whose associated sunspot active\nregions were located close to the solar limb. The measured periodicity of the\nbursts at 80 MHz was $\\approx$ 5.2 s and their average degree of circular\npolarization ($dcp$) was $\\approx 0.12$. We calculated the associated magnetic\nfield $B$ : (1) using the empirical relationship between the $dcp$ and $B$ for\nthe harmonic type III emission, and (2) from the observed quasi-periodicity of\nthe bursts. Both the methods result in $B \\approx$ 4.2 G at the location of the\n80 MHz plasma level (radial distance $r \\approx 1.3~\\rm R_{\\odot}$) in the\nactive region corona.\n", "  Modern high-energy physics experiments are in ever increasing need for\nradiation hard scintillators and detectors. In this regard, we have studied\nvarious radiation-hard scintillating materials such as Polyethylene Naphthalate\n(PEN), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), our prototype material Scintillator X\n(SX) and Eljen (EJ). Scintillation and transmission properties of these\nscintillators are studied using stimulated emission from a 334 nm wavelength UV\nlaser with PMT before and after certain amount of radiation exposure. Recovery\nfrom radiation damage is studied over time. While the primary goal of this\nstudy is geared for LHC detector upgrades, these new technologies could easily\nbe used for future experiments such as the FCC and ILC. Here we discuss the\nphysics motivation, recent developments and laboratory measurements of these\nmaterials.\n", "  The high flux of charged particles interacting with the CMS Forward Hadron\nCalorimeter PMT windows introduced a significant background for the trigger and\noffline data analysis. During Long Shutdown 1, all of the original PMTs were\nreplaced with multi-anode, thin window photomultiplier tubes. At the same time,\nthe back-end electronic readout system was upgraded to {\\mu}TCA readout. The\nexperience with commissioning and calibration of the Forward Hadron Calorimeter\nis described as well as the {\\mu}TCA system. The upgrade was successful and\nprovided quality data for Run 2 data-analysis at 13 TeV.\n", "  I review some recent work where ideas and methods from Quantum Field Theory\nhave proved useful in probability and vice versa. The topics discussed include\nthe use of Renormalization Group theory in Stochastic Partial Differential\nEquations driven by space-time white noise and the use of the theory of\nGaussian Multiplicative Chaos in the study of two dimensional Liouville\nConformal Field theory.\n", "  These lectures give an introduction to a probabilistic approach to Liouville\nQuantum Field Theory developed in a joint work with F. David, R. Rhodes and V.\nVargas.\n", "  This work evaluates the performance of carbon nanotube field effect\ntransistors (CNTFET) using few layer graphene as the contact electrode\nmaterial. We present the experimental results obtained on the barrier height at\nCNT graphene junction using temperature dependent IV measurements. The\nestimated barrier height in our devices for both holes and electrons is close\nto zero or slightly negative indicating the Ohmic contact of graphene with the\nvalence and conduction bands of CNTs. In addition, we also report that there is\nno correlation between the barrier height and thickness of graphene.\n", "  We report ground based, low frequency heliograph (80 MHz), spectral (85-35\nMHz) and polarimeter (80 and 40 MHz) observations of drifting, non-thermal\nradio continuum associated with the `halo' coronal mass ejection (CME) that\noccurred in the solar atmosphere on 2013 March 15. The magnetic field strengths\n($B$) near the radio source were estimated to be $B \\approx 2.2 \\pm 0.4$ G at\n80 MHz and $B \\approx 1.4 \\pm 0.2$ G at 40 MHz. The corresponding radial\ndistances ($r$) are $r \\approx 1.9~R_{\\odot}$ (80 MHz) and $r \\approx\n2.2~R_{\\odot}$ (40 MHz).\n", "  According to the unified model of active galactic nuclei, Seyfert 2 galaxies\nare physically the same as Seyfert 1 objects and they possess a broad-line\nregion (BLR), but it is hidden from the observer due to their orientation. In\nthe past few years, various authors reported that not all Seyfert 2 galaxies\nharbor a BLR. We compiled a sample of 38 Seyfert 2 galaxies to find non-hidden\nbroad-line region (non-HBLR) objects. Using the theory of Nicastro et al. which\nsuggests the existence of a critical value of the Eddington ratio below which\nBLR can't be formed, we found 26 non-HBLR Seyfert 2 candidates. We found also\nthat 5 of these 26 non-HBLR objects could be low-ionization nuclear\nemission-line regions (LINERs).\n", "  We demonstrate the large scale effects of the interplay between shape and\nhard core interactions in a system with left- and right-pointing arrowheads\n~$\\textless ~~ \\textgreater$~ on a line, with reorientation dynamics. This\ninterplay leads to the formation of two types of domain wall, diffusive ($A$)\nand static ($B$). The correlation length in the equilibrium state diverges\nexponentially with increasing arrowhead density, with an ordered state of like\norientations arising in the limit. In time, the approach to the ordered state\nis described by a coarsening process governed by the kinetics of domain wall\nannihilation $A+B\\rightarrow 0$, quite different from $A+A \\rightarrow 0$\nkinetics pertinent to the Glauber-Ising model. The survival probability of a\nfinite set of walls is shown to decay exponentially in time, in contrast to the\npower law decay known for $A+A \\rightarrow 0$. In the thermodynamic limit with\na finite density of walls, coarsening as a function of time $t$ is studied by\nsimulation. While the number of walls falls as $t^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, the fraction\nof persistent arrowheads decays as $t^{-\\theta}$ where $\\theta$ is close to\n$\\frac{1}{4}$, quite different from the Ising value. The global persistence too\nhas $\\theta=\\frac{1}{4}$, as follows from a heuristic argument. In a\ngeneralization where the $B$ walls diffuse slowly, $\\theta$ varies\ncontinuously, increasing with increasing diffusion constant.\n", "  Athena is a space-based X-ray observatory intended for exploration of the hot\nand energetic universe. One of the science instruments on Athena will be the\nX-ray Integrated Field Unit (X-IFU), which is a cryogenic X-ray spectrometer,\nbased on a large cryogenic imaging array of Transition Edge Sensors (TES) based\nmicrocalorimeters operating at a temperature of 100mK. The imaging array\nconsists of 3800 pixels providing 2.5 eV spectral resolution, and covers a\nfield of view with a diameter of of 5 arc minutes. Multiplexed readout of the\ncryogenic microcalorimeter array is essential to comply with the cooling power\nand complexity constraints on a space craft. Frequency domain multiplexing has\nbeen under development for the readout of TES-based detectors for this purpose,\nnot only for the X-IFU detector arrays but also for TES-based bolometer arrays\nfor the Safari instrument of the Japanese SPICA observatory. This paper\ndiscusses the design considerations which are applicable to optimise the\nmultiplex factor within the boundary conditions as set by the space craft. More\nspecifically, the interplay between the science requirements such as pixel\ndynamic range, pixel speed, and cross talk, and the space craft requirements\nsuch as the power dissipation budget, available bandwidth, and electromagnetic\ncompatibility will be discussed.\n", "  Top pair events provide a source of $b\\bar{b}$ pairs, which can be used to\nprobe CP violation in heavy-flavour mixing and decay. In events where one of\nthe $W$ bosons decays leptonically to an electron or muon, the charge of the\n$W$ boson can be used to determine unambiguously the charge of the accompanying\n$b$-quark at the time of its production. In cases where the $b$-quark also\ndecays semileptonically to a muon, this sample allows to probe two charge\nasymmetries constructed with the charge signs of the $W$ and the soft muon. The\nfirst measurement of the charge asymmetries in $b\\bar{b}$ from top pair decays\nis hence presented using the data collected with the ATLAS detector during the\n8 TeV run of the LHC.\n", "  We report the design and performance of a cross-polarized log-periodic dipole\n(CLPD) antenna for observations of polarized radio emission from the solar\ncorona at low frequencies. The measured isolation between the two mutually\northogonal log periodic dipole antennas was as low as $\\approx$ -43 dBm in the\n65-95 MHz range. We carried out observations of the solar corona at 80 MHz with\nthe above CLPD and successfully recorded circularly polarized emission.\n", "  In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of the self-field\ntransport properties of an ionic liquid gated ultra-thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$\nfilm. From the high temperature dynamic of the resistivity ($> 220 \\textrm{\nK}$) different scenarios pertaining to the interaction between the liquid and\nthe thin film are proposed. From the low temperature evolution of\n$J_{\\textrm{c}}$ and $T_{\\textrm{c}}$ a comparison between the behavior of our\nsystem and the standard properties of YBCO is drawn.\n", "  With this study we tried to investigate if male and female students have a\ndifferent perception of scientific careers. At the end, we would like to be\nable to provide hints on how to intervene to correct the path that seems to\nnaturally bring male students towards STEM disciplines (science, technology,\nengineering, and math) and reject female students from them.\n", "  Long-range metastable molecules consisting of two cesium atoms in high\nRydberg states have been observed in an ultracold gas. A sequential\nthree-photon two-color photoassociation scheme was employed to form these\nmolecules in states which correlate to $np(n+1)s$ dissociation asymptotes.\nSpectral signatures of bound molecular states are clearly resolved at the\npositions of avoided crossings between long-range van der Waals potential\ncurves. The experimental results are in agreement with simulations based on a\ndetailed model of the long-range multipole-multipole interactions of\nRydberg-atom pair states. We show that a full model is required to accurately\npredict the occurrence of bound Rydberg macrodimers. The macrodimers are\ndistinguished from repulsive molecular states by their behavior with respect to\nspontaneous ionization and possible decay channels are discussed.\n", "  We discuss how the likely 2018 redefinition of the SI system of units might\naffect the ability of students to understand the link between the units and the\nnew system. The likely redefinition will no longer define a set of base units,\nbut rather a set of constants of nature, such as the speed of light c and a\nparticular hyperfine splitting in Cs $\\Delta\\nu(^{133}$Cs)$_{hfs}$. We point\nout that this list of constants need not be the only way to introduce students\nto the subject, either in class or in textbooks. We suggest an alternative way\nto introduce high school and undergraduate students to the redefined SI, by\nsuggesting a list of experiments for some units; this list would be completely\ncompatible with the redefined SI, and would have all of the same scientific and\ntechnological advantages. We demonstrate by questionnaire results that this\nalternative is more appealing to students. We hope to spur a discussion amongst\nteachers regarding this important topic for high school and undergraduate\nphysics courses.\n", "  We use the solution of the Dirac equation for quarkonium atom in the 4D Anti\nde sitter (AdS$_{4}$) space to investigate the effect of the large negative\ncosmological constant on the phenomenon of quark confinement. We do the\nrequired calculations in the AdS$_{4}$ space to indicate that large\ncosmological constant can describe the quark confinement. In fact using the\ncoulomb potential in Dirac equation while we employ the AdS metric will\nadditionally lead us to a linear potential in the quark-antiquark interaction\nwhich can be considered to explain the quark confinement. This confining term\nis arising essentially from the geometrical features of the space. On the other\nhand the origin of the large cosmological constant can be justified by assuming\nthe appearance of micro black holes in the recent hadronic collision process\nwhich is now current, for instance, at the LHC project.\n", "  We analyse $f(R)$ theories of gravity from a dynamical system perspective,\nshowing how the $R^2$ correction in Starobinsky's model plays a crucial role\nfrom the viewpoint of the inflationary paradigm. Then, we propose a\nmodification of Starobinsky's model by adding an exponential term in the $f(R)$\nLagrangian. We show how this modification could allow to test the robustness of\nthe model by means of the predictions on the scalar spectral index $n_s$.\n", "  Spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations of perfect fluid obeying a\npolytropic equation of state are studied in spacetimes with a repulsive\ncosmological constant. The configurations are specified in terms of three\nparameters---the polytropic index $n$, the ratio of central pressure and\ncentral energy density of matter $\\sigma$, and the ratio of energy density of\nvacuum and central density of matter $\\lambda$. The static equilibrium\nconfigurations are determined by two coupled first-order nonlinear differential\nequations that are solved by numerical methods with the exception of polytropes\nwith $n=0$ corresponding to the configurations with a uniform distribution of\nenergy density, when the solution is given in terms of elementary functions.\nThe geometry of the polytropes is conveniently represented by embedding\ndiagrams of both the ordinary space geometry and the optical reference geometry\nreflecting some dynamical properties of the geodesic motion. The polytropes are\nrepresented by radial profiles of energy density, pressure, mass, and metric\ncoefficients. For all tested values of $n>0$, the static equilibrium\nconfigurations with fixed parameters $n$, $\\sigma$, are allowed only up to a\ncritical value of the cosmological parameter\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{c}}=\\lambda_{\\mathrm{c}}(n,\\sigma)$. In the case of $n>3$,\nthe critical value $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{c}}$ tends to zero for special values of\n$\\sigma$. The gravitational potential energy and the binding energy of the\npolytropes are determined and studied by numerical methods. We discuss in\ndetail the polytropes with an extension comparable to those of the dark matter\nhalos related to galaxies, i.e., with extension $\\ell > 100\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$ and\nmass $M > 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. ...\n", "  Early Wheeler-Feynman absorber theories invoke both retarded and advanced\nelectromagnetic waves for photon emission and absorption in order to remove\nproblems involving lack of radiative damping during electron acceleration.\nSubsequent inquiries have suggested that only certain cosmologies would allow\nsuch a retarded-advanced wave mechanism to exist. These include quasi-steady\nstate cosmologies and exclude flat, expanding Friedman-type cosmologies. Key to\nthe exclusion process is a diminishing density of future absorbers in an\never-expanding universe. Such absorbers would be expected to be real\nelectromagnetically interacting particles. However future virtual absorber\nsites, if they exist, would not be so diminished. Such sites would be plentiful\non the future light horizon, receding from the source at the speed of light.\nThe present treatment proposes that virtual absorption sites are present at\nevery point in spacetime, and are characterized by the Fresnel-Kirchhoff\ndiffraction integral. On the future light horizon, they can remove\nelectromagnetic energy from the local causal domain and provide advance wave\nsignals as Wheeler-Feynman absorbers.\n", "  For two decades, NdFeB based magnets have been a critical component in a\nrange of electrical devices engaged in energy production and conversion. The\nmagnet shape and the internal microstructure of the selected NdFeB grade govern\ntheir efficiency and size. However, stricter requirements on device efficiency\ncall for better performing magnets preferably with novel functionality not\nachievable today. Here we use 3D metal printing by Selective Laser Melting to\nfabricate dense net shape permanent magnets based on NdFeB that exhibit high\nmagnetic performance. Evidence is provided that the internal microstructure,\nnot achievable by traditional manufacturing means, is the origin of the solid\nmagnetic properties. The freedom in magnet body shape and size that ranges from\nthe millimeter to tens of centimeter scale opens up a design freedom that could\nbe a catalyzer for the next generation of electrical devices.\n", "  In laser micromachining, the ablation threshold (minimum fluence required to\ncause ablation) is a key performance parameter and overall indicator of the\nefficiency of material removal. For pulsed laser micromachining, this important\nobservable depends upon material properties, pulse properties and the number of\npulses applied in a complex manner that is not yet well understood. The\nincubation effect is one example. It manifests as a change in the ablation\nthreshold as a function of number of laser pulses applied and is driven by\nphotoinduced defect accumulation in the material. Here, we study femtosecond\n(800 nm, 110 fs, 0.1-1 mJ/pulse) micromachining of a material with well-defined\ninitial defect concentrations: doped Si across a range of dopant types and\nconcentrations. The single-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,1) was observed to\ndecrease with increasing dopant concentration, from a maximum of 0.70 J/cm2\n(+/-0.02) for undoped Si to 0.51 J/cm2 (+/-0.01) for highly N-type doped Si.\nThe effect was greater for N-type doped Si than for P-type, consistent with the\nhigher carrier mobility of electrons compared to holes. In contrast, the\ninfinite-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,inf) was the same for all doping levels\nand types. We attribute this asymptotic behaviour to a maximum defect\nconcentration that is independent of the initial defect concentration and type.\nThese results lend insight into the mechanism of multipulse, femtosecond laser\nablation.\n", "  In this paper a reaction-diffusion type equation is the starting point for\nsetting up a genuine thermodynamic reduction, i.e. involving a finite number of\nparameters or collective variables, of the initial system. This program is\ncarried over by firstly operating a finite Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction of the\ncited reaction-diffusion equation when reformulated as a variational problem.\nIn this way we gain an approximate finite-dimensional o.d.e. description of the\ninitial system which preserves the gradient structure of the original one and\nthat is similar to the approximate inertial manifold description of a p.d.e.\nintroduced by Temam and coworkers. Secondly, we resort to the stochastic\nversion of the o.d.e., taking into account in this way the uncertainty (loss of\ninformation) introduced with the above mentioned reduction. We study this\nreduced stochastic system using classical tools from large deviations,\nviscosity solutions and weak KAM Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In the last part we\nhighlight some essential similarities existing between our approach and the\ncomprehensive treatment non equilibrium thermodynamics given by Jona-Lasinio\nand coworkers. The starting point of their axiomatic theory --motivated by\nlarge deviations description of lattice gas models-- of systems in a stationary\nnon equilibrium state is precisely a conservation/balance law which is akin to\nour simple model of reaction-diffusion equation.\n", "  In this work, we introduce a facile procedure to graft a thin graphitic C3N4\n(g-C3N4) layer on aligned TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiNT) by one-step chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD) approach. This provides a platform to enhance the\nvisible-light response of TiO2 nanotubes for antimicrobial applications. The\nformed g- C3N4/TiNT binary nanocomposite exhibits excellent bactericidal\nefficiency against E. coli as a visiblelight activated antibacterial coating.\n", "  While the formulation of most data assimilation schemes assumes an unbiased\nobservation model error, in real applications, model error with nontrivial\nbiases is unavoidable. A practical example is the error in the radiative\ntransfer model (which is used to assimilate satellite measurements) in the\npresence of clouds. As a consequence, many (in fact 99\\%) of the cloudy\nobserved measurements are not being used although they may contain useful\ninformation. This paper presents a novel nonparametric Bayesian scheme which is\nable to learn the observation model error distribution and correct the bias in\nincoming observations. This scheme can be used in tandem with any data\nassimilation forecasting system. The proposed model error estimator uses\nnonparametric likelihood functions constructed with data-driven basis functions\nbased on the theory of kernel embeddings of conditional distributions developed\nin the machine learning community. Numerically, we show positive results with\ntwo examples. The first example is designed to produce a bimodality in the\nobservation model error (typical of \"cloudy\" observations) by introducing\nobstructions to the observations which occur randomly in space and time. The\nsecond example, which is physically more realistic, is to assimilate cloudy\nsatellite brightness temperature-like quantities, generated from a stochastic\ncloud model for tropical convection and a simple radiative transfer model.\n", "  The structure of many real-world systems is best captured by networks\nconsisting of several interaction layers. Understanding how a multi-layered\nstructure of connections affects the synchronization properties of dynamical\nsystems evolving on top of it is a highly relevant endeavour in mathematics and\nphysics, and has potential applications to several societally relevant topics,\nsuch as power grids engineering and neural dynamics. We propose a general\nframework to assess stability of the synchronized state in networks with\nmultiple interaction layers, deriving a necessary condition that generalizes\nthe Master Stability Function approach. We validate our method applying it to a\nnetwork of R\\\"ossler oscillators with a double layer of interactions, and show\nthat highly rich phenomenology emerges. This includes cases where the stability\nof synchronization can be induced even if both layers would have individually\ninduced unstable synchrony, an effect genuinely due to the true multi-layer\nstructure of the interactions amongst the units in the network.\n", "  In systems of ultracold atoms, pairwise interactions are resonantly enhanced\nby the application of an oscillating magnetic field that is parallel to the\nspin-quantization axis of the atoms. The resonance occurs when the frequency of\nthe applied field is precisely tuned near the transition frequency between the\nscattering atoms and a diatomic molecule. The resulting cross section can be\nmade more than two orders of magnitude larger than the cross section in the\nabsence of the oscillating field. The low momentum resonance properties have a\nuniversal description that is independent of the atomic species. To arrive at\nthese conclusions, we first develop a formal extension of Floquet theory to\ndescribe scattering of atoms with time-periodic, short-range interaction\npotentials. We then calculate the atomic scattering properties by modeling the\natomic interactions with a square well potential with oscillating depth and\nthen explicitly solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. We then apply\nthe Floquet formalism to the case of atoms scattering with a contact\ninteraction described by a time-periodic scattering length, obtaining analytic\nresults that agree with those obtained by solving the time-dependent\nSchrodinger equation.\n", "  We introduce a new self-accelerating wave packet solution of the Schrodinger\nequation in one dimension. We obtain an exact analytical parabolic cylinder\nwave for the inverted harmonic potential. We show that truncated parabolic\ncylinder waves exhibits their accelerating feature.\n", "  We propose a new algebraic approach to study compatibility of partial\ndifferential equations. The approach uses concepts from commutative algebra,\nalgebraic geometry and Gr\\\"obner bases to clarify crucial notions concerning\ncompatibility such as passivity (involution) and reducibility. One obtains\nsufficient conditions for a differential system to be passive and prove that\nsuch systems generate manifolds in the jet space. Some examples of\nconstructions of passive systems associated with the sinh-Gordon equation are\ngiven.\n", "  A general theory of the beam interaction with small discontinuities of the\nvacuum chamber is developed taking into account the reaction of radiated waves\nback on the discontinuity. The reactive impedance calculated earlier is\nreproduced as the first order, and the resistive one as the second order of a\nperturbation theory based on this general approach. The theory also gives, in a\nvery natural way, the results for the trapped modes due to small\ndiscontinuities obtained earlier by a different method.\n", "  Measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nradiation are expected to significantly increase our understanding of the early\nuniverse. We present a design for a CMB polarimeter in which a cryogenically\ncooled half wave plate rotates by means of a high-temperature superconducting\n(HTS) bearing. The design is optimized for implementation in MAXIPOL, a\nballoon-borne CMB polarimeter. A prototype bearing, consisting of commercially\navailable ring-shaped permanent magnet and an array of YBCO bulk HTS material,\nhas been constructed. We measured the coefficient of friction as a function of\nseveral parameters including temperature between 15 and 80 K, rotation\nfrequency between 0.3 and 3.5 Hz, levitation distance between 6 and 10 mm, and\nambient pressure between 10^{-7} and 1 torr. The low rotational drag of the HTS\nbearing allows rotations for long periods of time with minimal input power and\nnegligible wear and tear thus making this technology suitable for a future\nsatellite mission.\n", "  All sciences, including astronomy, are now entering the era of information\nabundance. The exponentially increasing volume and complexity of modern data\nsets promises to transform the scientific practice, but also poses a number of\ncommon technological challenges. The Virtual Observatory concept is the\nastronomical community's response to these challenges: it aims to harness the\nprogress in information technology in the service of astronomy, and at the same\ntime provide a valuable testbed for information technology and applied computer\nscience. Challenges broadly fall into two categories: data handling (or \"data\nfarming\"), including issues such as archives, intelligent storage, databases,\ninteroperability, fast networks, etc., and data mining, data understanding, and\nknowledge discovery, which include issues such as automated clustering and\nclassification, multivariate correlation searches, pattern recognition,\nvisualization in highly hyperdimensional parameter spaces, etc., as well as\nvarious applications of machine learning in these contexts. Such techniques are\nforming a methodological foundation for science with massive and complex data\nsets in general, and are likely to have a much broather impact on the modern\nsociety, commerce, information economy, security, etc. There is a powerful\nemerging synergy between the computationally enabled science and the\nscience-driven computing, which will drive the progress in science,\nscholarship, and many other venues in the 21st century.\n", "  In this paper we present a hybrid system composed by a neural network based\nestimator system and genetic algorithms. It uses an unsupervised Hebbian\nnonlinear neural algorithm to extract the principal components which, in turn,\nare used by the MUSIC frequency estimator algorithm to extract the frequencies.\nWe generalize this method to avoid an interpolation preprocessing step and to\nimprove the performance by using a new stop criterion to avoid overfitting.\nFurthermore, genetic algorithms are used to optimize the neural net weight\ninitialization. The experimental results are obtained comparing our methodology\nwith the others known in literature on a Cepheid star light curve.\n", "  One of the most relevant problems in the extraction of scientifically useful\ninformation from wide field astronomical images (both photographic plates and\nCCD frames) is the recognition of the objects against a noisy background and\ntheir classification in unresolved (star-like) and resolved (galaxies) sources.\nIn this paper we present a neural network based method capable to perform both\ntasks and discuss in detail the performance of object detection in a\nrepresentative celestial field. The performance of our method is compared to\nthat of other methodologies often used within the astronomical community.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of voltage-flux V(Phi)-characteristics for\nasymmetric dc SQUIDs with various kinds of asymmetries. For finite asymmetry\nalpha_I in the critical currents of the two Josephson junctions, the minima in\nthe V(Phi)-characteristics for bias currents of opposite polarity are shifted\nalong the flux axis by Delta_Phi = (alpha_I)*(beta_L) relative to each other;\nbeta_L is the screening parameter. This simple relation allows the\ndetermination of alpha_I in our experiments on YBa_2Cu_3O_(7-x} dc SQUIDs and\ncomparison with theory. Extensive numerical simulations within a wide range of\nbeta_L and noise parameter Gamma reveal a systematic dependence of the transfer\nfunction V_Phi on alpha_I and alpha_R (junction resistance asymmetry). As for\nthe symmetric dc SQUID, V_Phi factorizes into\ng(Gamma*beta_L)*f(alpha_I,beta_L), where now f also depends on alpha_I. For\n\\beta_L below five we find mostly a decrease of V_Phi with increasing alpha_I,\nwhich however can only partially account for the frequently observed\ndiscrepancy in V_Phi between theory and experiment for high-T_c dc SQUIDs.\n", "  We analyze fundamental issues related to the thermal and electrical stability\nof a coated conductor during its operation. We address the role of conductive\nbuffer layers in the stability of Ni-based coated conductors, and the effect of\na metallic cap layer on the electrical properties of Ni alloy-based\nsuperconducting tapes. For the first case we report on the fabrication of a\nfully conductive RABiTS architecture formed of bilayers of conductive oxides\nSrRuO3 and LaNiO3 on textured Ni tapes. For the second case we discuss\nmeasurements of current-voltage relations on Ag/YBa2Cu3O7-d and Cu/Ag/\nYBa2Cu3O7-d prototype multilayers on insulating substrates. Limitations on the\noverall tape structure and properties that are posed by the stability\nrequirement are presented.\n", "  The task of CDMA multiuser detection is to simultaneously estimate binary\nsymbols of $K$ synchronous users from the received $N$ base-band CDMA signals.\nMathematically, this can be formulated as an inference problem on a complete\nbipartite graph. In the research on graphically represented statistical models,\nit is known that the belief propagation (BP) can exactly perform the inference\nin a polynomial time scale of the system size when the graph is free from\ncycles in spite that the necessary computation for general graphs exponentially\nexplodes in the worst case. In addition, recent several researches revealed\nthat the BP can also serve as an excellent approximation algorithm even if the\ngraph has cycles as far as they are relatively long. However, as there exit\nmany short cycles in a complete bipartite graph, one might suspect that the BP\nwould not provide a good performance when employed for the multiuser detection.\n  The purpose of this paper is to make an objection to such suspicion. More\nspecifically, we will show that appropriate employment of the central limit\ntheorem and the law of large numbers to BP, which is one of the standard\ntechniques in statistical mechanics, makes it possible to develop a novel\nmultiuser detection algorithm the convergence property of which is considerably\nbetter than that of the conventional multistage detection without increasing\nthe computational cost significantly. Furthermore, we will also provide a\nscheme to analyse the dynamics of the proposed algorithm, which can be\nnaturally linked to the equilibrium analysis recently presented by Tanaka.\n", "  Belief propagation (BP) and the concave convex procedure (CCCP) are both\nmethods that utilize the Bethe free energy as a cost function and solve\ninformation processing tasks. We have developed a new algorithm that also uses\nthe Bethe free energy, but changes the roles of the master variables and the\nslave variables. This is called the Bowman-Levin (BL) approximation in the\ndomain of statistical physics. When we applied the BL algorithm to decode the\nGallager ensemble of short-length regular low-density parity check codes\n(LDPCC) over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, its average\nperformance was somewhat better than that of either BP or CCCP. This implies\nthat the BL algorithm can also be successfully applied to other problems to\nwhich BP or CCCP has already been applied.\n", "  We study the optical properties of a single core-shell GaAs-AlGaAs nanowire\n(grown by VLS method) using the technique of micro-photoluminescence and\nspatially-resolved photoluminescence imaging. We observe large linear\npolarization anisotropy in emission and excitation of nanowires.\n", "  We describe the near-field microwave microscopy of microwave devices on a\nlength scale much smaller than the wavelength used for imaging. Our microscope\ncan be operated in two possible configurations, allowing a quantitative study\nof either material properties or local electric fields.\n", "  We have fabricated the Bloch transistor shunted on-chip by a small-sized Cr\nresistor with Rs about 1 kOhm. The Bloch transistor normally consists of two\nsmall Josephson junctions connected in series, which in our case have been\nreplaced by two superconducting interferometer loops, each with two junctions\nin parallel. A capacitively coupled gate is supplied to control the induced\ncharge of the small intermediate electrode (island) of the transistor. The\nmeasured I-V curves show no hysteresis and correspond to the operation of a\neffective Josephson junction at the high-damping and strong-noise limits. The\ncritical current of the system was found to be close to its nominal value, that\nis in accordance with the electromagnetic environment theory. The I-V curves\nwere modulated by the gate with a period of e and a maximum swing of about 2\n/mu_V. Such rather moderate modulation results from the Josephson-to- charging\nenergies ratio, Ej/Ec about 9, in our sample being far from its optimum value\nof 0.3 up to 1.\n", "  Finding the entropy rate of Hidden Markov Processes is an active research\ntopic, of both theoretical and practical importance. A recently used approach\nis studying the asymptotic behavior of the entropy rate in various regimes. In\nthis paper we generalize and prove a previous conjecture relating the entropy\nrate to entropies of finite systems. Building on our new theorems, we establish\nseries expansions for the entropy rate in two different regimes. We also study\nthe radius of convergence of the two series expansions.\n", "  In this article new bounds on weighted p-norms of ambiguity functions and\nWigner functions are derived. Such norms occur frequently in several areas of\nphysics and engineering. In pulse optimization for Weyl--Heisenberg signaling\nin wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channels for example it is a\nkey step to find the optimal waveforms for a given scattering statistics which\nis a problem also well known in radar and sonar waveform optimizations. The\nsame situation arises in quantum information processing and optical\ncommunication when optimizing pure quantum states for communicating in bosonic\nquantum channels, i.e. find optimal channel input states maximizing the pure\nstate channel fidelity. Due to the non-convex nature of this problem the\noptimum and the maximizers itself are in general difficult find, numerically\nand analytically. Therefore upper bounds on the achievable performance are\nimportant which will be provided by this contribution. Based on a result due to\nE. Lieb, the main theorem states a new upper bound which is independent of the\nwaveforms and becomes tight only for Gaussian weights and waveforms. A\ndiscussion of this particular important case, which tighten recent results on\nGaussian quantum fidelity and coherent states, will be given. Another bound is\npresented for the case where scattering is determined only by some arbitrary\nregion in phase space.\n", "  In this work, we present the analytic treatment of the large order Bessel\nfunctions that arise in the Fourier Transform (FT) of the Gravitational Wave\n(GW) signal from a pulsar. We outline several strategies which employ\nasymptotic expansions in evaluation of such Bessel functions which also happen\nto have large argument. Large order Bessel functions also arise in the\nPeters-Mathews model of binary inspiralling stars emitting GW and several\nproblems in potential scattering theory. Other applications also arise in a\nvariety of problems in Applied Mathematics as well as in the Natural Sciences\nand present a challenge for High Performance Computing(HPC).\n", "  Many signal processing problems can be solved by maximizing the fitness of a\nsegmented model over all possible partitions of the data interval. This letter\ndescribes a simple but powerful algorithm that searches the exponentially large\nspace of partitions of $N$ data points in time $O(N^2)$. The algorithm is\nguaranteed to find the exact global optimum, automatically determines the model\norder (the number of segments), has a convenient real-time mode, can be\nextended to higher dimensional data spaces, and solves a surprising variety of\nproblems in signal detection and characterization, density estimation, cluster\nanalysis and classification.\n", "  Clarke and Barron have recently shown that the Jeffreys' invariant prior of\nBayesian theory yields the common asymptotic (minimax and maximin) redundancy\nof universal data compression in a parametric setting. We seek a possible\nanalogue of this result for the two-level {\\it quantum} systems. We restrict\nour considerations to prior probability distributions belonging to a certain\none-parameter family, $q(u)$, $-\\infty < u < 1$. Within this setting, we are\nable to compute exact redundancy formulas, for which we find the asymptotic\nlimits. We compare our quantum asymptotic redundancy formulas to those derived\nby naively applying the classical counterparts of Clarke and Barron, and find\ncertain common features. Our results are based on formulas we obtain for the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors of $2^n \\times 2^n$ (Bayesian density) matrices,\n$\\zeta_{n}(u)$. These matrices are the weighted averages (with respect to\n$q(u)$) of all possible tensor products of $n$ identical $2 \\times 2$ density\nmatrices, representing the two-level quantum systems. We propose a form of {\\it\nuniversal} coding for the situation in which the density matrix describing an\nensemble of quantum signal states is unknown. A sequence of $n$ signals would\nbe projected onto the dominant eigenspaces of $\\ze_n(u)$.\n", "  In evolution theory the concept of a fitness landscape has played an\nimportant role, evolution itself being portrayed as a hill-climbing process on\na rugged landscape. In this article it is shown that in general, in the\npresence of other genetic operators such as mutation and recombination,\nhill-climbing is the exception rather than the rule. This descrepency can be\ntraced to the different ways that the concept of fitness appears --- as a\nmeasure of the number of fit offspring, or as a measure of the probability to\nreach reproductive age. Effective fitness models the former not the latter and\ngives an intuitive way to understand population dynamics as flows on an\neffective fitness landscape when genetic operators other than selection play an\nimportant role. The efficacy of the concept is shown using several simple\nanalytic examples and also some more complicated cases illustrated by\nsimulations.\n", "  To study the impacts of price responsive demand on the electric power system\nrequires better load models. This paper discusses the modeling of uncertainties\nin aggregated thermostatically controlled loads using a state queueing (SQ)\nmodel. The cycling times of thermostatically controlled appliances (TCAs) vary\nwith the TCA types and sizes, as well as the ambient temperatures. The random\nconsumption of consumers, which shortens or prolongs a specific TCA cycling\nperiod, introduces another degree of uncertainty. By modifying the state\ntransition matrix, these random factors can be taken into account in a discrete\nSQ model. The impacts of considering load diversity in the SQ model while\nsimulating TCA setpoint response are also studied.\n", "  This brief paper further investigates the locally and globally adaptive\nsynchronization of an uncertain complex dynamical network. Several network\nsynchronization criteria are deduced. Especially, our hypotheses and designed\nadaptive controllers for network synchronization are rather simple in form. It\nis very useful for future practical engineering design. Moreover, numerical\nsimulations are also given to show the effectiveness of our synchronization\napproaches.\n", "  This paper describes how to determine the parameter values of the chaotic\nLorenz system used in a two-channel cryptosystem. The geometrical properties of\nthe Lorenz system are used firstly to reduce the parameter search space, then\nthe parameters are exactly determined, directly from the ciphertext, through\nthe minimization of the average jamming noise power created by the encryption\nprocess.\n", "  The mammalian ventilatory behavior exhibits nonlinear dynamics as reflected\nby certain nonlinearity or complexity indicators (e.g. correlation dimension,\napproximate entropy, Lyapunov exponents...) but this is not sufficient to\ndetermine its possible chaotic nature. To address this, we applied the noise\ntitration technique, previously shown to discern and quantify chaos in short\nand noisy time series, to ventilatory flow recordings obtained in quietly\nbreathing normal humans. Nine subjects (8 men and 1 woman, 24-42 yrs) were\nstudied during 15-minute epochs of ventilatory steady-state (10.1 +/- 3.0\nbreaths/minute, tidal volume 0.63 +/- 0.2L). Noise titration applied to the\nunfiltered signals subsampled at 5 Hz detected nonlinearity in all cases (noise\nlimit 20.2 +/- 12.5%). Noise limit values were weakly correlated to the\ncorrelation dimension and the largest Lyapunov exponent of the signals. This\nstudy shows that the noise titration approach evidences a chaotic dimension to\nthe behavior of ventilatory flow over time in normal humans during tidal\nbreathing.\n", "  Feedback systems are essential for stable operation of a linear collider,\nproviding a cost-effective method for relaxing tight tolerances. In the\nStanford Linear Collider (SLC), feedback controls beam parameters such as\ntrajectory, energy, and intensity throughout the accelerator. A novel dithering\noptimization system which adjusts final focus parameters to maximize luminosity\ncontributed to achieving record performance in the 1997-98 run. Performance\nlimitations of the steering feedback have been investigated, and improvements\nhave been made. For the Next Linear Collider (NLC), extensive feedback systems\nare planned as an intregal part of the design. Feedback requiremetns for JLC\n(the Japanese Linear Collider) are essentially identical to NLC; some of the\nTESLA requirements are similar but there are significant differences. For NLC,\nalgorithms which incorporate improvements upon the SLC implementation are being\nprototyped. Specialized systems for the damping rings, rf and interaction point\nwill operate at high bandwidth and fast response. To correct for the motion of\nindividual bunches within a train, both feedforward and feedback systems are\nplanned. SLC experience has shown that feedback systems are an invaluable\noperational tool for decoupling systems, allowing precision tuning, and\nproviding pulse-to-pulse diagnostics. Feedback systems for the NLC will\nincorporate the key SLC features and the benefits of advancing technologies.\n", "  We have demonstrated experimentally that the main breakdown-triggering\nmechanism in most gaseous detectors, including micropattern gaseous detectors,\nis sporadic electron jets from the cathode surfaces.\n  Depending on conditions, each jet contains randomly from a few primary\nelectrons up to 10^5, emitted in a time interval ranging between 0.1\nmicrosecond to milliseconds. After the emission, these primary electrons\nexperience a full gas multiplication in the detector and create spurious\npulses.\n  The rate of these jets increases with applied voltage and very sharply at\nvoltages close to the breakdown limit. We found that these jets are in our\nmeasurements responsible for the breakdown-triggering at any counting rate\nbetween 10^(-2) Hz/mm^2 and 10^8 Hz/mm^2. We demonstrated on a few detectors\nthat an optimized cathode-geometry, a high electrode surface quality and a\nproper choice of the gas mixture, considerably improve the performance\ncharacteristics and provide the highest possible gains.\n", "  The complex spatiotemporal patterns of atmospheric flows resulting from the\ncooperative existence of fluctuations ranging in size from millimeters to\nthousands of kilometers are found to exhibit long-range spatial and temporal\ncorrelations manifested as the selfsimilar fractal geometry to the global cloud\ncover pattern and the inverse power law form for the atmospheric eddy energy\nspectrum. Such long-range spatial and temporal correlations are ubiquitous to\nextended natural dynamical systems and is a signature of the strange attractor\ndesign characterizing deterministic chaos or self-organized criticality. The\nunified network of global atmospheric circulations is analogous to the neural\nnetworks of the human brain.\n", "  A combinatorial model of molecular conformational space that was previously\ndevelopped (J. Gabarro-Arpa, Comp. Biol. and Chem. 27, (2003) 153-159), had the\ndrawback that structures could not be properly embedded beacause it lacked\nexplicit rotational symmetry. The problem can be circumvented by sorting the\nelementary 3D components of a molecular system into a finite set of classes\nthat can be separately embedded. This also opens up the possibility of encoding\nthe dynamical states into a graph structure.\n", "  We review a novel method for characterizing both the spectral and spatial\nproperties of resonant cavities within two-dimensional photonic crystals (PCs).\nAn optical fiber taper serves as an external waveguide probe whose micron-scale\nfield is used to source and couple light from the cavity modes, which appear as\nresonant features in the taper's wavelength-dependent transmission spectrum\nwhen it is placed within the cavity's near field. Studying the linewidth and\ndepth of these resonances as a function of the taper's position with respect to\nthe resonator produces quantitative measurements of the quality factor Q and\nmodal volume Veff of the resonant cavity modes. Polarization information about\nthe cavity modes can be obtained by studying their depths of coupling when the\ncavity is probed along different axes by the taper. This fiber-based technique\nhas been used to measure Q ~ 40,000 and Veff ~ 0.9 cubic wavelengths in a\ngraded square lattice PC microcavity fabricated in silicon. The speed and\nversatility of this fiber-based probe is highlighted, and a discussion of its\napplicability to other wavelength-scale resonant elements is given.\n", "  Thin gap chambers (TGCs) are used for the muon trigger system in the forward\nregion of the LHC experiment ATLAS. A TGC consists of a plane of closely spaced\nwires maintained at positive high voltage, sandwiched between resistive\ngrounded cathode planes with an anode wire to cathode plane gap distance\nsmaller than the wire-to-wire spacing. The TGCs are expected to provide a\ntrigger signal within 25 ns of the bunch spacing of the LHC accelerator, with\nan efficiency exceeding 95%, while exposed to an effective photon and neutron\nbackground ranging from 30 to 500 Hz/cm2. About 2,500 out of the 3,600 ATLAS\nTGCs are being produced at the Weizmann institute in Israel, and in Shandong\nUniversity in China. Once installed in the ATLAS detector the TGCs will be\ninaccessible. A vigorous production quality control program is therefore\nimplemented at the production sites. Furthermore, after chamber completion, a\nthorough program of quality assurance is implemented to ensure the efficient\nperformance of the chambers during more than ten years of operation in the LHC\nhigh rate environment. This program consists of a detailed mapping of the\ndetectors response using cosmic rays, as well as checking the chambers behavior\nusing a high rate radiation source. An aging test performed on five chambers in\na serial gas connection is presented. Finally the results of the chambers\ncertification tests performed at CERN before the installation in ATLAS are\ndescribed.\n", "  We report progress on 115In+ and 137Ba+ single ion optical frequency\nstandards using all solid-state sources. Both are free from quadrupole field\nshifts and together enable a search for drift in fundamental constants.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2-D) boundary integral equation analysis of a notched\ncircular microdisk resonator is presented. Results obtained provide accurate\ndescription of optical modes, free from the staircasing and discretization\nerrors of other numerical techniques. Splitting of the double degenerate\nWhispering-Gallery (WG) modes and directional light output is demonstrated. The\neffect of the notch depth and width on the resonance wavelengths, Q-factors,\nand emission patterns is studied. Further improvement of the directionality is\ndemonstrated in an elliptical notched microdisk. Applications of the notched\nresonators to the design of microdisk lasers, oscillators, and biosensors are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We describe the development and first tests of Enobio, a dry electrode sensor\nconcept for biopotential applications. In the proposed electrodes, the tip of\nthe electrode is covered with a forest of multi-walled CNTs that can be coated\nwith Ag/AgCl to provide ionic-electronic transduction. The CNT brush-like\nstructure is to penetrate the outer layers of the skin improving electrical\ncontact as well as increae the contact surface area. In this paper, we report\nthe results of the first tests of this concept -- immersion on saline solution\nand pig skin signal detection. These indicate performance on a par with state\nof the art research-oriented wet electrodes.\n", "  To simulate open boundaries within finite computation domain, real-function\ncoordinate transformation in the framework of generally covariant formulation\nof Maxwell equations is proposed. The mapping--realized with arctangent\nfunction here--has a transparent geometric meaning of pure squeezing of space,\nis admissible by classical electrodynamics, does not introduce artificially\nlossy layers (or `lossy coordinates') to absorb outgoing radiation nor leads to\nnon-Maxwellian fields. At the same time, like for anisotropic perfectly matched\nlayers, no modification (except for transformation of material tensors) is\nneeded to existing nearest-neighbor computation schemes, which makes it well\nsuited for parallel computing implementation.\n", "  The new particle accelerators and its experiments create a challenging data\nprocessing environment, characterized by large amount of data where only small\nportion of it carry the expected new scientific information. Modern detectors,\nsuch as the Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC), achieve high accuracy of coordinate\nmeasurements (between 50 to 70 microns). However, heavy physical backgrounds\ncan decrease the accuracy significantly. In the presence of such background,\nthe charge induced over adjacent CSC strips (cluster) is different from the\nideal Matheison distribution. The traditional least squares method which takes\nthe same ideal position error for all clusters loses its optimal properties on\ncontaminated data. A new technique that calculates the cluster quality and uses\nit to improve the track fitting results is suggested. The algorithm is applied\non test beam data, and its performance is compared to other fitting methods. It\nis shown that the suggested algorithm improves the fitting performance\nsignificantly.\n", "  We have developed and tested several prototypes of GEM-like detectors with\nelectrodes coated with resistive layers: CuO or CrO. These detectors can\noperate stably at gains close to 10E5 and they are very robust. We discovered\nthat the cathodes of these detectors could be coated by CsI layers and in such\na way the detectors gain high efficiency for the UV photons. We also\ndemonstrated that such detectors can operate stably in the cascade mode and\nhigh overall gains (~10E6) are reachable. This opens applications in several\nareas, for example in RICH or in noble liquid TPCs. Results from the first\napplications of these devices for UV photon detection at room and cryogenic\ntemperatures are given.\n", "  A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary\nnodules in low-dose multi-detector helical Computed Tomography (CT) images with\n1.25 mm slice thickness is presented. The basic modules of our lung-CAD system,\na dot-enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a neural classifier\nfor false-positive finding reduction, are described. The results obtained on\nthe collected database of lung CT scans are discussed.\n", "  We develop a theory of the algorithmic information in bits contained in an\nindividual pure quantum state. This extends classical Kolmogorov complexity to\nthe quantum domain retaining classical descriptions. Quantum Kolmogorov\ncomplexity coincides with the classical Kolmogorov complexity on the classical\ndomain. Quantum Kolmogorov complexity is upper bounded and can be effectively\napproximated from above under certain conditions. With high probability a\nquantum object is incompressible. Upper- and lower bounds of the quantum\ncomplexity of multiple copies of individual pure quantum states are derived and\nmay shed some light on the no-cloning properties of quantum states. In the\nquantum situation complexity is not sub-additive. We discuss some relations\nwith ``no-cloning'' and ``approximate cloning'' properties.\n", "  We consider interactions as bidirectional channels. We investigate the\ncapacities for interaction Hamiltonians and nonlocal unitary gates to generate\nentanglement and transmit classical information. We give analytic expressions\nfor the entanglement generating capacity and entanglement-assisted one-way\nclassical communication capacity of interactions, and show that these\nquantities are additive, so that the asymptotic capacities equal the\ncorresponding 1-shot capacities. We give general bounds on other capacities,\ndiscuss some examples, and conclude with some open questions.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a\nset of linearly independent pure quantum states. We show that the design of the\noptimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result\ncan be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this\nformulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an\noptimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be\ncomputed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known\nalgorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge\nto the global optimum.\n  Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal\nprobability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is\noptimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement\n(EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the\nstates can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal.\n  Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal\nprior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider\ngeometrically uniform state sets that are defined over a group of unitary\nmatrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider\ncompound geometrically uniform state sets which are generated by a group of\nunitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating\nvectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.\n", "  The information-spectrum analysis made by Han for classical hypothesis\ntesting for simple hypotheses is extended to a unifying framework including\nboth classical and quantum hypothesis testing as well as fixed-length source\ncoding, whereby general formulas for several quantities concerning the\nasymptotic optimality of tests/codes are established in terms of classical and\nquantum information spectrum. Generality of theorems and simplicity of proofs\nare fully pursued, and as byproducts some improvements on the original\nclassical results are also obtained.\n", "  The capacity of a classical-quantum channel (or in other words the classical\ncapacity of a quantum channel) is considered in the most general setting, where\nno structural assumptions such as the stationary memoryless property are made\non a channel. A capacity formula as well as a characterization of the strong\nconverse property is given just in parallel with the corresponding classical\nresults of Verd\\'{u}-Han which are based on the so-called information-spectrum\nmethod. The general results are applied to the stationary memoryless case with\nor without cost constraint on inputs, whereby a deep relation between the\nchannel coding theory and the hypothesis testing for two quantum states is\nelucidated. no structural assumptions such as the stationary memoryless\nproperty are made on a channel. A capacity formula as well as a\ncharacterization of the strong converse property is given just in parallel with\nthe corresponding classical results of Verdu-Han which are based on the\nso-called information-spectrum method. The general results are applied to the\nstationary memoryless case with or without cost constraint on inputs, whereby a\ndeep relation between the channel coding theory and the hypothesis testing for\ntwo quantum states is elucidated.\n", "  General formulas of entanglement concentration are derived by using an\ninformation-spectrum approach for the i.i.d. sequences and the general\nsequences of partially entangled pure states. That is, we derive general\nrelations between the performance of the entanglement concentration and the\neigenvalues of the partially traced state. The achievable rates with constant\nconstraints and those with exponential constraints can be calculated from these\nformulas.\n", "  In Shannon information theory the capacity of a memoryless communication\nchannel cannot be increased by the use of feedback. In quantum information\ntheory the no-cloning theorem means that noiseless copying and feedback of\nquantum information cannot be achieved. In this paper, quantum feedback is\ndefined as the unlimited use of a noiseless quantum channel from receiver to\nsender. Given such quantum feedback, it is shown to provide no increase in the\nentanglement--assisted capacities of a memoryless quantum channel, in direct\nanalogy to the classical case. It is also shown that in various cases of\nnon-assisted capacities, feedback may increase the capacity of memoryless\nquantum channels.\n", "  We investigate coin-flipping protocols for multiple parties in a quantum\nbroadcast setting:\n  (1) We propose and motivate a definition for quantum broadcast. Our model of\nquantum broadcast channel is new.\n  (2) We discovered that quantum broadcast is essentially a combination of\npairwise quantum channels and a classical broadcast channel. This is a somewhat\nsurprising conclusion, but helps us in both our lower and upper bounds.\n  (3) We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal bias epsilon of a\ncoin which can be flipped by k parties of which exactly g parties are honest:\nfor any 1 <= g <= k, epsilon = 1/2 - Theta(g/k).\n  Thus, as long as a constant fraction of the players are honest, they can\nprevent the coin from being fixed with at least a constant probability. This\nresult stands in sharp contrast with the classical setting, where no\nnon-trivial coin-flipping is possible when g <= k/2.\n", "  We present sparse graph codes appropriate for use in quantum\nerror-correction. Quantum error-correcting codes based on sparse graphs are of\ninterest for three reasons. First, the best codes currently known for classical\nchannels are based on sparse graphs. Second, sparse graph codes keep the number\nof quantum interactions associated with the quantum error correction process\nsmall: a constant number per quantum bit, independent of the blocklength.\nThird, sparse graph codes often offer great flexibility with respect to\nblocklength and rate. We believe some of the codes we present are unsurpassed\nby previously published quantum error-correcting codes.\n", "  The use of satellites to distribute entangled photon pairs (and single\nphotons) provides a unique solution for long-distance quantum communication\nnetworks. This overcomes the principle limitations of Earth-bound technology,\ni.e. the narrow range of some 100 km provided by optical fiber and terrestrial\nfree-space links.\n", "  We address the question whether quantum memory is more powerful than\nclassical memory. In particular, we consider a setting where information about\na random n-bit string X is stored in r classical or quantum bits, for r<n,\ni.e., the stored information is bound to be only partial. Later, a randomly\nchosen binary question F about X is asked, which has to be answered using only\nthe stored information. The maximal probability of correctly guessing the\nanswer F(X) is then compared for the cases where the storage device is\nclassical or quantum mechanical, respectively.\n  We show that, despite the fact that the measurement of quantum bits can\ndepend arbitrarily on the question F to be answered, the quantum advantage is\nnegligible already for small values of the difference n-r.\n  An implication for cryptography is that privacy amplification by application\nof a compression function mapping n-bit strings to s-bit strings (for some\ns<n-r), chosen publicly from a two-universal class of hash functions, remains\nessentially equally secure when the adversary's memory is allowed to be r\nquantum rather than only r classical bits.\n", "  We are concerned with catalyst-assisted probabilistic entanglement\ntransformations. A necessary and sufficient condition is presented under which\nthere exist partial catalysts that can increase the maximal transforming\nprobability of a given entanglement transformation. We also design an algorithm\nwhich leads to an efficient method for finding the most economical partial\ncatalysts with minimal dimension. The mathematical structure of\ncatalyst-assisted probabilistic transformation is carefully investigated.\n", "  This paper presents a prepare-and-measure scheme using $N$-dimensional\nquantum particles as information carriers where $N$ is a prime power. One of\nthe key ingredients used to resist eavesdropping in this scheme is to\ndepolarize all Pauli errors introduced to the quantum information carriers.\nUsing the Shor-Preskill-type argument, we prove that this scheme is\nunconditionally secure against all attacks allowed by the laws of quantum\nphysics. For $N = 2^n > 2$, each information carrier can be replaced by $n$\nentangled qubits. In this case, there is a family of eavesdropping attacks on\nwhich no unentangled-qubit-based prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution\nscheme known to date can generate a provably secure key. In contrast, under the\nsame family of attacks, our entangled-qubit-based scheme remains secure\nwhenever $2^n \\geq 4$. This demonstrates the advantage of using entangled\nparticles as information carriers and of using depolarization of Pauli errors\nto combat eavesdropping attacks more drastic than those that can be handled by\nunentangled-qubit-based prepare-and-measure schemes.\n", "  We consider the problem of switching off unwanted interactions in a given\nmulti-partite Hamiltonian. This is known to be an important primitive in\nquantum information processing and several schemes have been presented in the\nliterature to achieve this task. A method to construct decoupling schemes for\nquantum systems of pairwise interacting qubits was introduced by M.\nStollsteimer and G. Mahler and is based on orthogonal arrays. Another approach\nbased on triples of Hadamard matrices that are closed under pointwise\nmultiplication was proposed by D. Leung. In this paper, we show that both\nmethods lead to the same class of decoupling schemes. Moreover, we establish a\ncharacterization of orthogonal arrays by showing that they are equivalent to\ndecoupling schemes which allow a refinement into equidistant time-slots.\nFurthermore, we show that decoupling schemes for networks of higher-dimensional\nquantum systems with t-local Hamiltonians can be constructed from classical\nerror-correcting codes.\n", "  Simple rate-1/3 single-error-correcting unrestricted and CSS-type quantum\nconvolutional codes are constructed from classical self-orthogonal\n$\\F_4$-linear and $\\F_2$-linear convolutional codes, respectively. These\nquantum convolutional codes have higher rate than comparable quantum block\ncodes or previous quantum convolutional codes, and are simple to decode. A\nblock single-error-correcting [9, 3, 3] tail-biting code is derived from the\nunrestricted convolutional code, and similarly a [15, 5, 3] CSS-type block code\nfrom the CSS-type convolutional code.\n", "  We develop a formalism for distilling a classical key from a quantum state in\na systematic way, expanding on our previous work on secure key from bound\nentanglement [K. Horodecki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005)]. More detailed\nproofs, discussion and examples are provided of the main results. Namely, we\ndemonstrate that all quantum cryptographic protocols can be recast in a way\nwhich looks like entanglement theory, with the only change being that instead\nof distilling EPR pairs, the parties distill private states. The form of these\ngeneral private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful\nways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by\ncertain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not\na requirement for a private key. We find that such bound entangled states are\nuseful for a cryptographic primitive we call a controlled private quantum\nchannel. We also find a general class of states which have negative partial\ntranspose (are NPT), but which appear to be bound entangled. The relative\nentropy distance is shown to be an upper bound on the rate of key. This allows\nus to compute the exact value of distillable key for a certain class of private\nstates.\n", "  Decoy state quantum key distribution (QKD) has been proposed as a novel\napproach to improve dramatically both the security and the performance of\npractical QKD set-ups. Recently, many theoretical efforts have been made on\nthis topic and have theoretically predicted the high performance of decoy\nmethod. However, the gap between theory and experiment remains open. In this\npaper, we report the first experiments on decoy state QKD, thus bridging the\ngap. Two protocols of decoy state QKD are implemented: one-decoy protocol over\n15km of standard telecom fiber, and weak+vacuum protocol over 60km of standard\ntelecom fiber. We implemented the decoy state method on a modified commercial\nQKD system. The modification we made is simply adding commercial acousto-optic\nmodulator (AOM) on the QKD system. The AOM is used to modulate the intensity of\neach signal individually, thus implementing the decoy state method. As an\nimportant part of implementation, numerical simulation of our set-up is also\nperformed. The simulation shows that standard security proofs give a zero key\ngeneration rate at the distance we perform decoy state QKD (both 15km and\n60km). Therefore decoy state QKD is necessary for long distance secure\ncommunication. Our implementation shows explicitly the power and feasibility of\ndecoy method, and brings it to our real-life.\n", "  A method for concatenating quantum error-correcting codes is presented. The\nmethod is applicable to a wide class of quantum error-correcting codes known as\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. As a result, codes that achieve a high rate\nin the Shannon theoretic sense and that are decodable in polynomial time are\npresented. The rate is the highest among those known to be achievable by CSS\ncodes. Moreover, the best known lower bound on the greatest minimum distance of\ncodes constructible in polynomial time is improved for a wide range.\n", "  We give a short proof that the coherent information is an achievable rate for\nthe transmission of quantum information through a noisy quantum channel. Our\nmethod is to produce random codes by performing a unitarily covariant\nprojective measurement on a typical subspace of a tensor power state. We show\nthat, provided the rank of each measurement operator is sufficiently small, the\ntransmitted data will with high probability be decoupled from the channel's\nenvironment. We also show that our construction leads to random codes whose\naverage input is close to a product state and outline a modification yielding\nunitarily invariant ensembles of maximally entangled codes.\n", "  A lower bound on the probability of decoding error of quantum communication\nchannel is presented. The strong converse to the quantum channel coding theorem\nis shown immediately from the lower bound. It is the same as Arimoto's method\nexept for the difficulty due to non-commutativity.\n", "  In information theory the reliability function and its bounds, describing the\nexponential behavior of the error probability, are the most important\nquantitative characteristics of the channel performance. From a general point\nof view, these bounds provide certain measures of distinguishability of a given\nset of states. In an earlier paper we introduced quantum analogs of the random\ncoding and the expurgation lower bounds for the case of pure signal states.\nHere we discuss the general case, in particular, we prove the previously\nconjectured expurgation bound and find the quantum cutoff rate in the case of\narbitrary mixed signal states.\n"]}
