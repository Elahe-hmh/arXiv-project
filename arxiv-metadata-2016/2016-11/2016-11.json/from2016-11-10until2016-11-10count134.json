This linewidth is comparable to the typical\nlinewidth of atomic ensemble based quantum memories. Single-mode output is\nrealized by setting a reasonable cavity length difference between different\npolarizations, using of temperature controlled etalons and actively stabilizing\nthe cavity. The entangled property is characterized with quantum state\ntomography, giving a fidelity of 94% between our state and a maximally\nentangled state. The coherence length is directly measured to be 32 m through\ntwo-photon interference.\n", "  A directional photon-assisted resonant chiral tunneling through a bilayer\ngraphene barrier is considered. An external electromagnetic field applied to\nthe barrier switches the transparency $T$ in the longitudinal direction from\nits steady state value T=0 to the ideal T=1 at no energy costs. The switch\nhappens because the a.c. field affects the phase correlation between the\nelectrons and holes inside the graphene barrier changing the whole angular\ndependence of the chiral tunneling (directional photoelectric effect). The\nsuggested phenomena can be implemented in relevant experiments and in various\nsub-millimeter and far-infrared optical electronic devices.\n", "  We have analyzed the energetics of decay of the X^- trion (exciton +\nelectron) on the assumption that the exciton and trion are independent\nexcitations of a single two-dimensional semiconducting quantum well. For the\nfirst time, it has been shown that in filling a well with electrons from a\nselective donor-doped matrix, the binding energy of the trion (of the electron\nwith the exciton) increases linearly with a shift of the Fermi level into the\ndepth of the c band. This agrees with the well-known experimental data on the\nlow-temperature radiative decay (photoluminescence) of trions in the\nheterostructures ZnSe/Zn_0.89Mg_0.11S_0.18Se_0.82 and CdTe/Cd_0.7Mg_0.3Te.\n", "  In recent years, there has been heightened interest in quantum teleportation,\nwhich allows for the transfer of unknown quantum states over arbitrary\ndistances. Quantum teleportation not only serves as an essential ingredient in\nlong-distance quantum communication, but also provides enabling technologies\nfor practical quantum computation. Of particular interest is the scheme\nproposed by Gottesman and Chuang [Nature \\textbf{402}, 390 (1999)], showing\nthat quantum gates can be implemented by teleporting qubits with the help of\nsome special entangled states. Therefore, the construction of a quantum\ncomputer can be simply based on some multi-particle entangled states, Bell\nstate measurements and single-qubit operations. The feasibility of this scheme\nrelaxes experimental constraints on realizing universal quantum computation.\nUsing two different methods we demonstrate the smallest non-trivial module in\nsuch a scheme---a teleportation-based quantum entangling gate for two different\nphotonic qubits. One uses a high-fidelity six-photon interferometer to realize\ncontrolled-NOT gates and the other uses four-photon hyper-entanglement to\nrealize controlled-Phase gates. The results clearly demonstrate the working\nprinciples and the entangling capability of the gates. Our experiment\nrepresents an important step towards the realization of practical quantum\ncomputers and could lead to many further applications in linear optics quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  A conversion of thermal energy into electricity is considered in the\nelectrically polarized graphene stripes with zigzag edges where the heavy\nchiral fermion (HCF) states are formed. The stripes are characterized by a high\nelectric conductance Ge and by a significant Seebeck coefficient S. The\nelectric current in the stripes is induced due to a non-equilibrium thermal\ninjection of \"hot\" electrons. This thermoelectric generation process might be\nutilized for building of thermoelectric generators with an exceptionally high\nfigure of merit Z{\\delta}T \\simeq 100 >> 1 and with an appreciable electric\npower densities \\sim 1 MW/cm2.\n", "  In this work we present a new class of Runge-Kutta (RK) methods for solving\nsystems of hyperbolic equations with a particular structure, generalization of\na wave-equation. The new methods are {\\it partially implicit} in the sense that\na proper subset of the equations of the system contains some terms which are\ntreated implicitly. These methods can be viewed as a particular case of the\nimplicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for systems of equations with wave-like\nstructure. For these systems, the optimal methods with the new structure are\neasier to derive than the IMEX ones, specially when aiming at higher-order (up\nto fourth-order in this work). The methods are constructed considering the\nclassical strong-stability-preserving optimal explicit RK methods for the\npurely explicit part. The resulting partially implicit RK methods do not\nrequire any inversion of operators and hence their computational cost per\niteration is similar to those of explicit RK methods. We analyse the stability\nand convergence properties and show their practical applicability in several\nnumerical examples. Our results show that, compared with explicit RK methods,\nthe new methods have better stability properties (larger steps are allowed) and\nin general show smaller discretization error.\n", "  In this article we discuss an exactly solvable, one-dimensional, periodic toy\ncharge density wave model introduced in [D.C. Kaspar, M. Mungan, EPL {\\bf 103},\n46002 (2013)]. In particular, driving the system with a uniform force, we show\nthat the depinning threshold configuration is an explicit function of the\nunderlying disorder, as is the evolution from the negative threshold to the\npositive threshold, the latter admitting a description in terms of record\nsequences. This evolution is described by an avalanche algorithm, which\nidentifies a sequence of static configurations that are stable at successively\nstronger forcing, and is useful both for analysis and simulation. We focus in\nparticular on the behavior of the polarization $P$, which is related to the\ncumulative avalanche size, as a function of the threshold force minus the\ncurrent force $(F_{\\mathrm{th}} - F)$, as this has been the focus of several\nprior numerical and analytical studies of CDW systems. The results presented\nare rigorous, with exceptions explicitly indicated, and show that the depinning\ntransition in this model is indeed a dynamic critical phenomenon.\n", "  For the eigenvalues of principal submatrices of stochastically evolving\nWigner matrices, we construct and study the edge scaling limit: a random\ndecreasing sequence of continuous functions of two variables, which at every\npoint has the distribution of the Airy point process. The analysis is based on\nthe methods developed by Soshnikov to study the extreme eigenvalues of a single\nWigner matrix.\n", "  Decompositional equivalence is the principle that there is no preferred\ndecomposition of the universe into subsystems. It is shown here, by using\nsimple thought experiments, that quantum theory follows from decompositional\nequivalence together with Landauer's principle. This demonstration raises\nwithin physics a question previously left to psychology: how do human - or any\n- observers agree about what constitutes a \"system of interest\"?\n", "  We present a microscopic calculation of multi-nucleon transfer reactions\nemploying the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. In our previous\npublication [Phys. Rev. C 88, 014614 (2013)], we reported our analysis for the\nmulti-nucleon transfer processes for several systems. Here we discuss effects\nof particle evaporation processes on the production cross sections. Since\nparticle evaporation processes may not be described adequately by the TDHF\ncalculations, we evaluate them using a statistical model. As an input of the\nstatistical model, excitation energies of the final fragments are necessary. We\nevaluate them from the TDHF wave function after collisions, extending the\nparticle number projection technique. From the calculation, the particle\nevaporation effects are found to improve descriptions of the production cross\nsections. However, the production cross sections are still underestimated for\nprocesses where a number of protons are transferred. Possible origins of the\ndiscrepancy are discussed.\n", "  We propose a way to study one-dimensional statistical mechanics models with\ncomplex-valued action using transfer operators. The argument consists of two\nsteps. First, the contour of integration is deformed so that the associated\ntransfer operator is a perturbation of a normal one. Then the transfer operator\nis studied using methods of semi-classical analysis.\n  In this paper we concentrate on the second step, the main technical result\nbeing a semi-classical estimate for powers of an integral operator which is\napproximately normal.\n", "  We investigate the destiny of a gray soliton in a repulsive one-dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate undergoing a sudden quench of the non-linearity\nparameter. The outcome of the quench is found to depend dramatically on the\nratio $\\eta$ of the final and initial values of the speed of sound. For integer\n$\\eta$ the soliton splits into exactly $2\\eta-1$ solitons. For non-integer\n$\\eta$ the soliton decays into multiple solitons and Bogoliubov modes. The case\nof integer $\\eta$ is analyzed in detail. The parameters of solitons in the\nout-state are found explicitly. Our approach exploits the inverse scattering\nmethod and can be easily used for the similar quenches in any classical\nintegrable system.\n", "  We present an effective medium theory that can predict the effective\npermittivity and permeability of a geometrically anisotropic two-dimensional\nmetamaterial composed with a rectangular array of elliptical cylinders. It is\npossible to obtain a closed-form analytical solution for the anisotropic\neffective medium parameters if the aspect ratio of the lattice and the\neccentricity of elliptical cylinder satisfy certain conditions. The derived\neffective medium theory can recover the well-known Maxwell-Garnett results in\nthe quasi-static regime. More importantly, it is valid beyond the\nlong-wavelength limit, where the wavelength in the host medium is comparable to\nthe size of the lattice so that previous anisotropic effective medium theories\nfail. The validity of the derived effective medium theory is verified by band\nstructure calculations. A real sample of a recent theoretically proposed\nanisotropic medium with near-zero index to control flux is achieved from the\nderived effective medium theory and control of electromagnetic waves in the\nsample is clearly demonstrated. The accuracy of the theory is further\nsystematically studied as material and geometric parameter varies, and we find\nthe derived effective medium theory applies over a large range in the parameter\nspace. Such applicability greatly broadens the applicable realm of the\neffective medium theory and opens many vistas in the design of structures with\ndesired anisotropic material characteristics.\n", "  We theoretically investigate multinucleon transfer (MNT) processes in\n$^{238}$U+$^{124}$Sn reaction at $E_\\mathrm{lab}=5.7$ MeV/$A$ using the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. For this reaction, measurements of\nMNT processes have been reported, showing substantial MNT cross sections\naccompanying more than ten protons. From the calculation, we find that the\namount of transferred nucleons depends much on the relative orientation between\nthe deformation axis of $^{238}$U and the relative vector connecting centers of\n$^{238}$U and $^{124}$Sn nuclei. We find a formation of thick neck when the\n$^{238}$U collides from its tip with $^{124}$Sn. However, the neck formation is\nsubstantially suppressed when $^{238}$U collides from its side. We have found\nthat a large number of protons are transferred in the tip collision. This is\ncaused by the breaking of the neck and subsequent absorption of nucleons in the\nneck region. We thus conclude that the measured MNT processes involving about\nten protons originate from the neck breaking dynamics in the tip collisions of\na deformed $^{238}$U nucleus.\n", "  Quantization of the magneto-thermoelectric transport is studied when an\nexternal d.c. magnetic field is applied to the C/N-knot formed as crossing\nbetween a narrow stripe of conducting atomic monolayer C on the one hand and\nmetal stripe N on the other hand. The temperature gradient in C is created by\ninjecting the non-equilibrium electrons, holes and phonons from the heater H\nthereby directing them toward the C/N-knot. A non-linear coupling between\nelectron states of the C/N-knot counter electrodes causes splitting of the heat\nflow into several fractions owing to the Lorentz force acting in the C/N-knot\nvicinity, thereby inducing the magneto-thermoelectric current in N whereas the\nphonons pass and propagate along C further ahead. The heat flow along C\ngenerates a transversal electric current in N showing a series of maximums when\ndimensions of the Landau orbits and the C/N-knot match each other. It allows\nobserving the interplay between the quantum Hall effect and the spatial\nquantization.\n", "  This paper presents new transit photometry from the Isaac Newton Telescope of\ntwo transiting exoplanetary systems, XO-5 and WASP-82. In each case the new\ntransit light curve is more precise than any other of that system previously\npublished. The new data are analysed alongside previously-published photometry\nand radial velocities, resulting in an improved orbital ephemeris and a refined\nset of system parameters in each case. The observational baseline of XO-5 is\nextended by very nearly four years, resulting in a determination of the orbital\nperiod of XO-5b to a precision of just 50 ms. The mass and radius of XO-5b are\n1.19$\\pm$0.03 and 1.14$\\pm$0.03 times those of Jupiter, respectively. The light\ncurve of WASP-82 is only the second published for this system. The planetary\nmass is 1.25$\\pm$0.05 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, and the radius is 1.71$\\pm$0.08 $M_{\\rm\nJup}$.\n", "  Using global considerations, Mess proved that the moduli space of globally\nhyperbolic flat Lorentzian structures on $S\\times\\mathbb{R}$ is the tangent\nbundle of the Teichm\\\"uller space of $S$, if $S$ is a closed surface. One of\nthe goals of this paper is to deepen this surprising occurrence and to make\nexplicit the relation between the Mess parameters and the embedding data of any\nCauchy surface. This relation is pointed out by using some specific properties\nof Codazzi tensors on hyperbolic surfaces. As a by-product we get a new\nLorentzian proof of Goldman's celebrated result about the coincidence of the\nWeil-Petersson symplectic form and the Goldman pairing.\n  In the second part of the paper we use this machinery to get a classification\nof globally hyperbolic flat space-times with particles of angles in $(0,2\\pi)$\ncontaining a uniformly convex Cauchy surface. The analogue of Mess' result is\nachieved showing that the corresponding moduli space is the tangent bundle of\nthe Teichm\\\"uller space of a punctured surface. To generalize the theory in the\ncase of particles, we deepen the study of Codazzi tensors on hyperbolic\nsurfaces with cone singularities, proving that the well-known decomposition of\na Codazzi tensor in a harmonic part and a trivial part can be generalized in\nthe context of hyperbolic metrics with cone singularities.\n", "  The correspondence of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) and its modification (MGB) models\nof dark energy with the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas-scalar field\nmodels (SCG and GCG) have been studied in a {\\deg}at universe. The exact\nsolution of potentials and scalar fields, which describe the accelerated\nexpansion of the universe, are reconstructed. According to the evolutionary\nbehavior of the GB and MGB models, the same form of dynamics of scalar field\nand potential for different SCG and GCG models are derived. By calculating the\nsquared sound speed of the MGB, GB model as well as the SCG, GCG, and\ninvestigating the GB-Chaplygin gas from the viewpoint of linear perturbation\ntheory, we find that the best results which is consistent with the observation,\nmay be appeared by considering the MGB-GCG. Also we find out some bounds for\nparameters.\n", "  An ideal quantum walk transitions from one vertex to another with perfect\nfidelity, but in physical systems, the particle may be hindered by potential\nenergy barriers. Then the particle has some amplitude of tunneling through the\nbarriers, and some amplitude of staying put. We investigate the algorithmic\nconsequence of such barriers for the quantum walk formulation of Grover's\nalgorithm. We prove that the failure amplitude must scale as $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$\nfor search to retain its quantum $O(\\sqrt{N})$ runtime; otherwise, it searches\nin classical $O(N)$ time. Thus searching larger \"databases\" requires\nincreasingly reliable hop operations or error correction. This condition holds\nfor both discrete- and continuous-time quantum walks.\n", "  We show that properties of hypergeometric type equations become transparent\nif they are derived from appropriate 2nd order partial differential equations\nwith constant coefficients. In particular, we deduce the symmetries of the\nhypergeometric and Gegenbauer equation from conformal symmetries of the 4- and\n3-dimensional Laplace equation. We also derive the symmetries of the confluent\nand Hermite equation from the so-called Schr\\\"odinger symmetries of the heat\nequation in 2 and 1 dimension. Finally, we also describe how properties of the\n${}_0F_1$ equation follow from the Helmholtz equation in 2 dimensions.\n", "  The transition to turbulence exhibits remarkable spatio-temporal behavior\nthat continues to defy detailed understanding. Near the onset to turbulence in\npipes, transient turbulent regions decay either directly or, at higher Reynolds\nnumbers through splitting, with characteristic time-scales that exhibit a\nsuper-exponential dependence on Reynolds number. Here we report numerical\nsimulations of transitional pipe flow, showing that a zonal flow emerges at\nlarge scales, activated by anisotropic turbulent fluctuations; in turn, the\nzonal flow suppresses the small-scale turbulence leading to stochastic\npredator-prey dynamics. We show that this \"ecological\" model of transitional\nturbulence reproduces the super-exponential lifetime statistics and\nphenomenology of pipe flow experiments. Our work demonstrates that a fluid on\nthe edge of turbulence is mathematically analogous to an ecosystem on the edge\nof extinction, and provides an unbroken link between the equations of fluid\ndynamics and the directed percolation universality class.\n", "  Positive semi-definite expressions for the time-domain macroscopic energy\ndensity in passive, spatially nondispersive, dipolar continua are derived from\nthe underlying microscopic Maxwell equations satisfied by classical models of\ndiscrete bound dipolar molecules or inclusions of the material or metamaterial\ncontinua. The microscopic derivation reveals two distinct positive\nsemi-definite macroscopic energy expressions, one that applies to diamagnetic\ncontinua and another that applies to paramagnetic continua. The diamagnetic\ndipoles are \"unconditionally passive\" in that their Amperian magnetic dipole\nmoments are zero in the absence of applied fields. The analysis of paramagnetic\ncontinua, whose magnetization is caused by the alignment of randomly oriented\n\"permanent\" Amperian magnetic dipole moments that dominate any induced\ndiamagnetic magnetization, is greatly simplified by first proving that the\nmicroscopic power equations for rotating \"permanent\" Amperian magnetic dipoles\n(which are shown to not satisfy unconditional passivity) reduce effectively to\nthe same power equations obeyed by rotating unconditionally passive\nmagnetic-charge magnetic dipoles. The difference between the macroscopic\nparamagnetic and diamagnetic energy expressions is equal to a \"hidden energy\"\nthat parallels the hidden momentum often attributed to Amperian magnetic\ndipoles. The microscopic derivation reveals that this hidden energy is drawn\nfrom the reservoir of inductive energy in the initial paramagnetic microscopic\nAmperian magnetic dipole moments. The macroscopic, positive semi-definite,\ntime-domain energy expressions are applied to lossless bianisotropic media to\ndetermine the inequalities obeyed by the frequency-domain bianisotropic\nconstitutive parameters. Subtleties associated with the causality as well as\nthe group and energy-transport velocities for diamagnetic media are discussed.\n", "  We demonstrate a simple scheme to reach Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of\nmetastable triplet helium atoms using a single beam optical dipole trap with\nmoderate power of less than 3 W. Our scheme is based on RF-induced evaporative\ncooling in a quadrupole magnetic trap and transfer to a single beam optical\ndipole trap that is located below the magnetic trap center. We transfer 1x10^6\natoms into the optical dipole trap, with an initial temperature of 14 \\mu K,\nand observe efficient forced evaporative cooling both in a hybrid trap, in\nwhich the quadrupole magnetic trap operates just below the levitation gradient,\nand in the pure optical dipole trap, reaching the onset of BEC with 2x10^5\natoms and a pure BEC of 5x10^4 atoms. Our work shows that a single beam hybrid\ntrap can be applied for a light atom, for which evaporative cooling in the\nquadrupole magnetic trap is strongly limited by Majorana spin-flips, and the\nvery small levitation gradient limits the axial confinement in the hybrid trap.\n", "  Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon (MPTD) equations in the Lagrangian\nformulation correspond to the minimal interaction of spin with gravity. Due to\nthe interaction, in the Lagrangian equations instead of the original metric $g$\nemerges spin-dependent effective metric $G=g+h(S)$. So we need to decide, which\nof them the MPTD particle sees as the space-time metric. We show that MPTD\nequations, if considered with respect to original metric, have unsatisfactory\nbehavior: the acceleration in the direction of velocity grows up to infinity in\nthe ultra-relativistic limit. If considered with respect to $G$, the theory has\nno this problem. But the metric now depends on spin, so there is no unique\nspace-time manifold for the Universe of spinning particles: each particle\nprobes his own three-dimensional geometry. This can be improved by adding a\nnon-minimal interaction of spin with gravity through gravimagnetic moment. The\nmodified MPTD equations with unit gravimagnetic moment have reasonable behavior\nwithin the original metric.\n", "  The first direct measurement of electron-neutrino quasielastic and\nquasielastic-like scattering on hydrocarbon in the few-GeV region of incident\nneutrino energy has been carried out using the MINERvA detector in the NuMI\nbeam at Fermilab. The flux-integrated differential cross sections in electron\nproduction angle, electron energy and $Q^{2}$ are presented. The ratio of the\nquasielastic, flux-integrated differential cross section in $Q^{2}$ for\n$\\nu_{e}$ with that of similarly-selected $\\nu_{\\mu}$-induced events from the\nsame exposure is used to probe assumptions that underpin conventional\ntreatments of charged-current $\\nu_{e}$ interactions used by long-baseline\nneutrino oscillation experiments. The data are found to be consistent with\nlepton universality and are well-described by the predictions of the neutrino\nevent generator GENIE.\n", "  Unitary $k$-designs are finite ensembles of unitary matrices that approximate\nthe Haar distribution over unitary matrices. Several ensembles are known to be\n2-designs, including the uniform distribution over the Clifford group, but no\nfamily of ensembles was previously known to form a 3-design. We prove that the\nClifford group is a 3-design, showing that it is a better approximation to\nHaar-random unitaries than previously expected. Our proof strategy works for\nany distribution of unitaries satisfying a property we call Pauli 2-mixing and\nproceeds without the use of heavy mathematical machinery. We also show that the\nClifford group does not form a 4-design, thus characterizing how well random\nClifford elements approximate Haar-random unitaries. Additionally, we show that\nthe generalized Clifford group for qudits is not a 3-design unless the\ndimension of the qudit is a power of 2.\n", "  We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario at the reheating era. Our setup is\nminimal in the sense that, in addition to the standard model Lagrangian, we\nonly consider an inflaton and higher dimensional operators. The lepton number\nasymmetry is produced not by the decay of a heavy particle, but by the\nscattering between the standard model particles. After the decay of an\ninflaton, the model is described within the standard model with higher\ndimensional operators. The Sakharov's three conditions are satisfied by the\nfollowing way. The violation of the lepton number is realized by the\ndimension-5 operator. The complex phase comes from the dimension-6 four lepton\noperator. The universe is out of equilibrium before the reheating is completed.\nIt is found that the successful baryogenesis is realized for the wide range of\nparameters, the inflaton mass and reheating temperature, depending on the\ncutoff scale. Since we only rely on the effective Lagrangian, our scenario can\nbe applicable to all mechanisms to generate neutrino Majorana masses.\n", "  Cooperative behaviors are common in humans and are fundamental to our\nsociety. Theoretical and experimental studies have modeled environments in\nwhich the behaviors of humans, or agents, have been restricted to analyze their\nsocial behavior. However, it is important that such studies are generalized to\nless restrictive environments to understand human society. Social network games\n(SNGs) provide a particularly powerful tool for the quantitative study of human\nbehavior. In SNGs, numerous players can behave more freely than in the\nenvironments used in previous studies; moreover, their relationships include\napparent conflicts of interest and every action can be recorded. We focused on\nreciprocal altruism, one of the mechanisms that generate cooperative behavior.\nThis study aims to investigate cooperative behavior based on reciprocal\naltruism in a less restrictive environment. For this purpose, we analyzed the\nsocial behavior underlying such cooperative behavior in an SNG. We focused on a\ngame scenario in which the relationship between the players was similar to that\nin the Leader game. We defined cooperative behaviors by constructing a payoff\nmatrix in the scenario. The results showed that players maintained cooperative\nbehavior based on reciprocal altruism, and cooperators received more advantages\nthan noncooperators. We found that players constructed reciprocal relationships\nbased on two types of interactions, cooperative behavior and unproductive\ncommunication.\n", "  In this work we investigate how event-by-event hydrodynamics fluctuations\naffect the nuclear suppression factor and elliptic flow of heavy flavor mesons\nand non-photonic electrons. We use a 2D+1 Lagrangian ideal hydrodynamic code on\nan event-by-event basis in order to compute local temperature and flow\nprofiles. Using a strong coupling inspired energy loss parametrization on top\nof the evolving space-time energy density distributions we are able to\npropagate the heavy quarks inside the medium until the freeze-out temperature\nis reached and a Pythia modeling of hadronization takes place. The resulting\nD$^0$ and heavy-flavor electron yield is compared with recent experimental data\nfor $R_\\text{AA}$ and $v_2$ from the STAR and Phenix collaborations. In\naddition we present preditions for the higher order Fourier harmonic\ncoefficients $v_3(p_T)$ of heavy-flavor electrons at RHIC's $\\sqrt{S_\\text{NN}}\n= 200$ GeV collisions.\n", "  We investigate the search for heavy Majorana neutrinos stemming from a\ncomposite model scenario at the upcoming LHC Run II at a center of mass energy\nof 13 TeV. While previous studies of the composite Majorana neutrino were\nfocussed on gauge interactions via magnetic type transition coupling between\nordinary and heavy fermions (with mass $m^*$) here we complement the composite\nmodel with contact interactions at the energy scale $\\Lambda$ and we find that\nthe production cross sections are dominated by such contact interactions by\nroughly two/three orders of magnitude. This mechanism provides therefore very\ninteresting rates at the prospected luminosities. We study the same sign\ndi-lepton and di-jet signature ($pp \\to \\ell\\ell jj$) and perform a fast\ndetector simulation based on Delphes. We compute 3$\\sigma$ and 5$\\sigma$\ncontour plots of the statistical significance in the parameter space\n($\\Lambda,m^*$). We find that the potentially excluded regions at $\\sqrt{s}\n=13$ TeV are quite larger than those excluded so far at Run I considering\nsearches with other signatures.\n", "  The ultimate semiclassical wave packet propagation technique is a complex,\ntime-dependent WBK method known as generalized Gaussian wave packet dynamics\n(GGWPD). It requires overcoming many technical difficulties in order to be\ncarried out fully in practice. In its place roughly twenty years ago,\nlinearized wave packet dynamics was generalized to methods that include sets of\noff-center, real trajectories for both classically integrable and chaotic\ndynamical systems that completely capture the dynamical transport. The\nconnections between those methods and GGWPD are developed in a way that enables\na far more practical implementation of GGWPD. The generally complex saddle\npoint trajectories at its foundation are found using a multi-dimensional,\nNewton-Raphson root search method that begins with the set of off-center, real\ntrajectories. This is possible because there is a one-to-one correspondence.\nThe neighboring trajectories associated with each off-center, real trajectory\nform a path that crosses a unique saddle; there are exceptions which are\nstraightforward to identify. The method is applied to the kicked rotor to\ndemonstrate the accuracy improvement as a function of $\\hbar$ that comes with\nusing the saddle point trajectories.\n", "  In this Letter we analyze theoretically how the emergence of collective\nstrong coupling between vibrational excitations and confined cavity modes\naffects Raman scattering processes. This work is motivated by recent\nexperiments [Shalabney et al., Angew. Chemie 54, 7971 (2015)], which reported\nenhancements of up to three orders of magnitude in the Raman signal. By using\ndifferent models within linear response theory, we show that the total Raman\ncross section is maintained constant when the system evolves from the\nweak-coupling limit to the strong-coupling regime. A redistribution of the\nRaman signal among the two polaritons is the main fingerprint of vibrational\nstrong coupling in the Raman spectrum.\n", "  In classical systems, our recent theoretical study provides new insight into\nhow spatial constraint on the system connects with macroscopic properties,\nwhich lead to universal representation of equilibrium macroscopic physical\nproperty and structure in disordered states. These important characteristics\nrely on the fact that statistical interdependence for density of microscopic\nstates (DOMS) in configuration space appears numerically vanished at\nthermodynamic limit for a wide class of spatial constraints, while such\nbehavior of the DOMS is not quantitatively well-understood so far. The present\nstudy theoretically address this problem based on the Random Matrix with\nGaussian Orthogonal Ensemble, where corresponding statistical independence is\nmathematically guaranteed. Using the generalized Ising model, we confirm that\nlower-order moment of density of eigenstates (DOE) of covariance matrix of DOMS\nshows asymptotic behavior to those for Random Matrix with increase of system\nsize. This result supports our developed theoretical approach, where\nequilibrium macroscopic property in disordered states can be decomposed into\nindividual contribtion from each generalized coordinate with the sufficiently\nhigh number of constituents in the given system, leading to representing\nequilibrium macroscopic properties by a few special microscopic states.\n", "  We take a soliton solution of a classical non-linear integrable equation and\nquench (suddenly change) its non-linearity parameter. For that we multiply the\namplitude or the width of a soliton by a numerical factor $\\eta$ and take the\nobtained profile as a new initial condition. We find the values of $\\eta$ at\nwhich the post-quench solution consists of only a finite number of solitons.\nThe parameters of these solitons are found explicitly. Our approach is based on\nsolving the direct scattering problem analytically. We demonstrate how it works\nfor Kortewig-de-Vries, sine-Gordon and non-linear Schr\\\"odinger integrable\nequations.\n", "  A major signature of quantum mechanics beyond classical physics is coherence,\nthe existence of superposition states. The recently developed resource theory\nof quantum coherence allows the formalisation of incoherent operations -- those\noperations which cannot create coherence. We identify the set of operations\nwhich additionally do not use coherence. These are such that coherence cannot\nbe exploited by a classical observer, who measures incoherent properties of the\nsystem, to go beyond classical dynamics. We give a physical interpretation in\nterms of interferometry and prove a dilation theorem, showing how these\noperations can always be constructed by interacting the system in an incoherent\nway with an ancilla. Such a physical justification is not known for the\nincoherent operations, thus our results lead to a physically well-motivated\nresource theory of coherence. Next, we investigate the implications for\ncoherence in multipartite systems. We show that quantum correlations can be\ndefined naturally with respect to a fixed basis, providing a link between\ncoherence and quantum discord. We demonstrate the interplay between these two\nquantities under our studied operations, and suggest implications for the\ntheory of quantum discord by relating the studied operations to those which\ncannot create discord.\n", "  The magnetization dynamics induced by standing elastic waves excited in a\nthin ferromagnetic film is described with the aid of micromagnetic simulations\ntaking into account the magnetoelastic coupling between spins and lattice\nstrains. The simulations have been performed for the 2 nm thick Fe81Ga19 film\ndynamically strained by longitudinal and transverse standing waves with various\nfrequencies, which span a wide range around the resonance frequency nu_res of\ncoherent magnetization precession in unstrained Fe81Ga19 film. It is found that\nstanding elastic waves give rise to complex local magnetization dynamics and\nspatially inhomogeneous dynamic magnetic patterns. The spatio-temporal\ndistributions of the magnetization oscillations in standing elastic waves have\nthe form of standing spin waves with the same wavelength. Remarkably, the\namplitude of magnetization precession does not go to zero at the nodes of these\nspin waves, which cannot be precisely described by simple analytical formulae.\nIn the steady-state regime, the magnetization oscillates with the frequency of\nelastic wave, except for the case of longitudinal waves with frequencies well\nbelow nu_res, where the magnetization precesses with a variable frequency\nstrongly exceeding the wave frequency. The precession amplitude at the\nantinodes of standing spin waves strongly increases when the frequency of\nelastic wave becomes close to nu_res. The results obtained for the\nmagnetization dynamics driven by elastic waves are used to calculate the spin\ncurrent pumped from the dynamically strained ferromagnet into adjacent\nparamagnetic metal. Importantly, the transverse charge current created by the\nspin current via the inverse spin Hall effect is high enough to be measured\nexperimentally.\n", "  We propose several covariant models which may solve one of the problems in\nthe cosmological constant. One of the model can be regarded as an extension of\nsequestering model. Other models could be regarded as extensions of the\ncovariant formulation of the unimodular gravity. The contributions to the\nvacuum energy from the quantum corrections from the matters are absorbed into a\nredefinition of a scalar field and the quantum corrections become irrelevant to\nthe dynamics. In a class of the extended unimodular gravity models, we also\nconsider models which are regarded as topological field theories. The models\ncan be extended and not only the vacuum energy but any quantum corrections to\nthe gravitational action could become irrelevant for the dynamics. We find,\nhowever, that the BRS symmetry in the topological field theories is broken\nspontaneously and therefore the models might not be consistent.\n", "  A precise measure of the mid-infrared interstellar extinction law is crucial\nto the investigation of the properties of interstellar dust, especially of the\ngrains in the large size end. Based on the stellar parameters derived from the\nSDSS-III/APOGEE spectroscopic survey, we select a large sample of G- and K-type\ngiants as the tracers of the Galactic mid-infrared extinction. We calculate the\nintrinsic stellar color excesses from the stellar effective temperatures and\nuse them to determine the mid-infrared extinction for a given line of sight.\nFor the entire sky of the Milky Way surveyed by APOGEE, we derive the\nextinction (relative to the K$_{\\rm S}$ band at wavelength $\\lambda=2.16\\mu$m)\nfor the four WISE bands at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22$\\mu$m, the four Spitzer/IRAC\nbands at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8$\\mu$m, the Spitzer/MIPS24 band at 23.7$\\mu$m and\nfor the first time, the AKARI/S9W band at 8.23$\\mu$m. Our results agree with\nprevious works in that the extinction curve is flat in the ~3--8$\\mu$m\nwavelength range and is generally consistent with the $R_V=5.5$ model curve\nexcept our determination exceeds the model prediction in the WISE/W4 band.\nAlthough some previous works found that the mid-IR extinction law appears to\nvary with the extinction depth $A_{\\rm{K_S}}$, no noticeable variation has been\nfound in this work. The uncertainties are analyzed in terms of the bootstrap\nresampling method and Monte-Carlo simulation and are found to be rather small.\n", "  We obtain the local density of states (LDOS) for any nanoplasmonic system in\nthe frequency range dominated by a localized surface plasmon. By including the\nOhmic losses in a consistent way, we show that the plasmon LDOS is proportional\nto the local field intensity normalized by the absorbed power. We obtain\nexplicit formulas for the energy transfer (ET) between quantum emitters and\nplasmons as well as between donors and acceptors situated near a plasmonic\nstructure. In the latter case, we find that the plasmon-assisted ET rate is\nproportional to the LDOS product at the donor and acceptor positions, obtain,\nin a general form, the plasmon ET enhancement factor, and establish the\ntransition onset between Forster-dominated and plasmon-dominated ET regimes.\n", "  In a search for Lead-free materials that could be used as alternatives to the\nhybrid perovskites,(MA)PbX3, in photovoltaic applications, we have discovered a\nhybrid double perovskite, (MA)2KBiCl6, which shows striking similarities to the\nlead analogues. Spectroscopic measurements and nanoindentation studies are\ncombined with density functional calculations to reveal the properties of this\ninteresting system.\n", "  The Raman selection rules of the (ZnSe, BeSe) mixed phonon polariton created\nby alloying in the three mode (1ZnSe, 2BeSe) ZnBeSe system, whose dramatic S\nlike dispersion covers the large frequency gap between the ZnSe and BeSe\nspectral ranges, is studied in its wave vector dependence by near forward\nscattering. Both the collapse regime away from the Brillouin zone centre and\nthe reinforcement regime near the Brillouin zone centre are addressed, using\nappropriate laser lines and Be contents. We find that in both regimes the\nconsidered phonon polariton, in fact a transverse mode with mixed mechanical\nand electrical character, obeys the same nominal Raman selection rules as its\npurely mechanical variant commonly observed in the backscattering geometry.\nBesides, marked differences in the phonon polariton Raman lineshapes in the two\nregimes give a hint about how the phonon polariton electrical field E develops\nwhile descending the S like dispersion towards the Brillouin zone centre. In\nthe reinforcement regime E is large, leading to intramode on top of intermode\ntransfers of oscillator strength mediated by E between the two BeSe modes, that\nboth exhibit a fine structure on account of the alloy disorder. In contrast, in\nthe collapse regime E remains weak, as testified by the absence of intramode\ntransfer. The discussion is supported by contour modeling of the multi phonon\npolariton Raman lineshapes in their wave vector dependence within the linear\ndielectric approach.\n", "  In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the first, second, and so\non rows of stochastically decaying partitions. We establish that, with\nappropriate scaling in time and length, the sequence of rows converges to the\nAiry$_2$ line ensemble.\n  This result was first established, in a more general setting, by Borodin and\nOlshanski, who relied on the determinantal structure of the Poissonized\ncorrelation functions. Our argument is based on a different, combinatorial\napproach, developed by Okounkov. This approach may be useful in other problems\nin which no determinantal structure is available, and also highlights the\nsimilarity between random partitions and random matrices.\n", "  I propose the emergence of the spin-orbital-coupled vector chirality in a\nnon-frustrated Mott insulator with the strong spin-orbit coupling due to\n$ab$-plane's inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking. I derive the superexchange\ninteractions for a $t_{2g}$-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice with the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling and the IS-breaking-induced hopping integrals, and\nexplain the microscopic origins of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) -type and the\nKitaev-type interactions. Then, by adopting the mean-field approximation to a\nminimal model including only the Heisenberg-type and the DM-type\nnearest-neighbor interactions, I show that the IS breaking causes the\nspin-orbital-coupled chirality as a result of stabilizing the screw state. I\nalso highlight the limit of the hard-pseudospin approximation in discussing the\nstability of the screw states in the presence of both the DM-type and the\nKitaev-type interactions, and discuss its meaning. I finally discuss the\neffects of tetragonal crystal field and $J_{\\textrm{eff}}=\\frac{3}{2}$ states,\nand the application to the iridates near the $[001]$ surface of\nSr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ and the interface between Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ and\nSr$_{3}$Ir$_{2}$O$_{7}$.\n", "  We present a numerical method to accurately simulate particle size\ndistributions within the formalism of rate equation cluster dynamics. This\nmethod is based on a discretization of the associated Fokker-Planck equation.\nWe show that particular care has to be taken to discretize the advection part\nof the Fokker-Planck equation, in order to avoid distortions of the\ndistribution due to numerical diffusion. For this purpose we use the\nKurganov-Noelle-Petrova scheme coupled with the monotonicity-preserving\nreconstruction MP5, which leads to very accurate results. The interest of the\nmethod is highlighted on the case of loop coarsening in aluminum. We show that\nthe choice of the models to describe the energetics of loops does not\nsignificantly change the normalized loop distribution, while the choice of the\nmodels for the absorption coefficients seems to have a significant impact on\nit.\n", "  A large number of mathematical models have been proposed to describe the\nmeasured signal in diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and\ninfer properties about the white matter microstructure. However, a head-to-head\ncomparison of DW-MRI models is critically missing in the field. To address this\ndeficiency, we organized the \"White Matter Modeling Challenge\" during the\nInternational Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2015 conference. This\ncompetition aimed at identifying the DW-MRI models that best predict unseen DW\ndata. in vivo DW-MRI data was acquired on the Connectom scanner at the\nA.A.Martinos Center (Massachusetts General Hospital) using gradients strength\nof up to 300 mT/m and a broad set of diffusion times. We focused on assessing\nthe DW signal prediction in two regions: the genu in the corpus callosum, where\nthe fibres are relatively straight and parallel, and the fornix, where the\nconfiguration of fibres is more complex. The challenge participants had access\nto three-quarters of the whole dataset, and their models were ranked on their\nability to predict the remaining unseen quarter of data. In this paper we\nprovide both an overview and a more in-depth description of each evaluated\nmodel, report the challenge results, and infer trends about the model\ncharacteristics that were associated with high model ranking. This work\nprovides a much needed benchmark for DW-MRI models. The acquired data and model\ndetails for signal prediction evaluation are provided online to encourage a\nlarger scale assessment of diffusion models in the future.\n", "  The classical massless SU(2) field theory has an infinite number of gauge\nequivalent representations of the vacuum. We show that among these there exists\na non-perturbative center vortex representation with some similarity to the\nquantum vacuum of the same theory. This classical SU(2) vacuum consists of a\nlattice of center vortex pairs combining to triviality. However, this\ntriviality can be broken by perturbations, for example by adding a mass term,\nor by considering the electroweak theory where the Higgs field does the\nbreaking, or by quantum fluctuations like in QCD.\n", "  We have studied the {\\em Zitterbewegung} effect on an infinite two\ndimensional sheet with honeycomb lattice. By tuning the perpendicular electric\nfield and the magnetization of the sheet, it can enter different topological\nphases. We have shown that the phase and magnitude of Zitterbewegung effect,\ni.e. the jittering motion of relativistic particles, correlates with the\nvarious topological phases. The topological phase diagram can be reconstructed\nby analyzing these features. Our findings are applicable to materials like\nsilicene, germanene, stanene etc.\n", "  Typical performance of approximation algorithms is studied for randomized\nminimum vertex cover problems. A wide class of random graph ensembles\ncharacterized by an arbitrary degree distribution is discussed with some\ntheoretical frameworks. Here three approximation algorithms are examined; the\nlinear-programming relaxation, the loopy-belief propagation, and the\nleaf-removal algorithm. The former two algorithms are analyzed using the\nstatistical-mechanical technique while the average-case analysis of the last\none is studied by the generating function method. These algorithms have a\nthreshold in the typical performance with increasing the average degree of the\nrandom graph, below which they find true optimal solutions with high\nprobability. Our study reveals that there exist only three cases determined by\nthe order of the typical-performance thresholds. We provide some conditions for\nclassifying the graph ensembles and demonstrate explicitly examples for the\ndifference in the threshold.\n", "  We study the fate of weakly coupled dual QED3 in the infrared, that is, a\nsingle two-component Dirac fermion coupled to an emergent U(1) gauge field, but\nwithout Chern-Simons term. This theory has recently been proposed as a dual\ndescription of 2D surfaces of certain topological insulators. Using the\nrenormalization group, we find that the interplay of gauge fluctuations with\ngenerated interactions in the four-fermi sector stabilizes an interacting\nconformal field theory (CFT) with finite four-fermi coupling in the infrared.\nThe emergence of this CFT is due to cancellations in the $\\beta$-function of\nthe four-fermi coupling special to \"NF = 1/2\". We also quantify how a possible\n\"strong\" Dirac fermion duality between a free Dirac cone and dual QED3 would\nconstrain the universal constants of the topological current correlator of the\nlatter.\n", "  The energy density of cosmic neutrinos measured by IceCube matches the one\nobserved by Fermi in extragalactic photons that predominantly originate in\nblazars. This has inspired attempts to match Fermi sources with IceCube\nneutrinos. A spatial association combined with a coincidence in time with a\nflaring source may represent a smoking gun for the origin of the IceCube flux.\nIn June 2015, the Fermi Large Area Telescope observed an intense flare from\nblazar 3C 279 that exceeded the steady flux of the source by a factor of forty\nfor the duration of a day. We show that IceCube is likely to observe neutrinos,\nif indeed hadronic in origin, in data that are still blinded at this time. We\nalso discuss other opportunities for coincident observations that include a\nrecent flare from blazar 1ES 1959+650 that previously produced an intriguing\ncoincidence with AMANDA observations.\n", "  We give an explicit QCD sum rule investigation to hidden-charm baryonium\nstates with the quark content $u\\bar u d\\bar d c\\bar c$, spin $J=0/1/2/3$, and\nof both positive and negative parities. We systematically construct the\nrelevant local hidden-charm baryonium interpolating currents, which can\nactually couple to various structures, including hidden-charm baryonium states,\ncharmonium states plus two pions, and hidden-charm tetraquark states plus one\npion, etc. We do not know which structure these currents couple to at the\nbeginning, but after sum rule analyses we can obtain some information. We find\nsome of them can couple to hidden-charm baryonium states, using which we\nevaluate the masses of the lowest-lying hidden-charm baryonium states with\nquantum numbers $J^P=2^-/3^-/0^+/1^+/2^+$ to be around 5.0 GeV. We suggest to\nsearch for hidden-charm baryonium states, especially the one of $J=3^-$, in the\n$D$-wave $J/\\psi \\pi \\pi$ and $P$-wave $J/\\psi \\rho$ and $J/\\psi \\omega$\nchannels in this energy region.\n", "  Topological mechanics and phononics have recently emerged as an exciting\nfield of study. Here we introduce and study generalizations of the\nthree-dimensional pyrochlore lattice that have topologically protected edge\nstates and Weyl lines in their bulk phonon spectra, which lead to zero surface\nmodes that flip from one edge to the opposite as a function of surface\nwavenumber.\n", "  This Letter presents a measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross\nsection using 60 $\\mu$b$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collisions at a center-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s}$ of $13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Inelastic\ninteractions are selected using rings of plastic scintillators in the forward\nregion ($2.07<|\\eta|<3.86$) of the detector. A cross section of $68.1\\pm 1.4$\nmb is measured in the fiducial region $\\xi=M_X^2/s>10^{-6}$, where $M_X$ is the\nlarger invariant mass of the two hadronic systems separated by the largest\nrapidity gap in the event. In this $\\xi$ range the scintillators are highly\nefficient. For diffractive events this corresponds to cases where at least one\nproton dissociates to a system with $M_X>13$ GeV. The measured cross section is\ncompared with a range of theoretical predictions. When extrapolated to the full\nphase space, a cross-section of $78.1 \\pm 2.9$ mb is measured, consistent with\nthe inelastic cross section increasing with center-of-mass energy.\n", "  We consider the exactly solvable quantum mechanical systems whose\neigenfunctions are described by the multi-indexed orthogonal polynomials of\nLaguerre, Jacobi, Wilson and Askey-Wilson types. Corresponding to the\nrecurrence relations with constant coefficients for the $M$-indexed orthogonal\npolynomials, it is expected that the systems satisfy the generalized closure\nrelations. In fact we can verify this statement for small $M$ examples. The\ngeneralized closure relation gives the exact Heisenberg operator solution of a\ncertain operator, from which the creation and annihilation operators of the\nsystem are obtained.\n", "  Density functional theory screening of the hybrid double perovskites\n(MA)2BIBiX6 (BI=K,Cu,Ag,Tl; X=Cl,Br,I) shows that systems with band gaps\nsimilar to those of the MAPbX3 lead compounds can be expected for BI=Cu,Ag,Tl.\nMotivated by these findings, (MA)2TlBiBr6, isoelectronic with MAPbBr3, was\nsynthesised and found to have a band gap of ~2.0eV.\n", "  We propose a simple two-dimensional acoustic crystal to realize topologically\nprotected edge states for acoustic waves. The acoustic crystal is composed of a\ntriangular array of core-shell cylinders embedded in a water host. By utilizing\nthe point group symmetry of two doubly degenerate eigenstates at the \\Gamma\npoint, we can construct pseudo-time-reversal symmetry as well as pseudo-spin\nstates in this classical system. We develop an effective Hamiltonian model for\nthe associated dispersion bands around the Brillouin zone center, and find the\ninherent link between the band inversion and the topological phase transition.\nWith numerical simulations, we unambiguously demonstrate the unidirectional\npropagation of acoustic edge states along the interface between a topologically\nnontrivial acoustic crystal and a trivial one, and the robustness of the edge\nstates against defects with sharp bends. Our work provides a new design\nparadigm for manipulating and transporting acoustic waves in a topologically\nprotected manner. Technological applications and devices based on our design\nare expected in various frequency ranges of interest, spanning from infrasound\nto ultrasound.\n", "  BRST quantization is an elegant and powerful method to quantize theories with\nlocal symmetries. In this article we study the Hamiltonian BRST quantization of\ncosmological perturbations in a universe dominated by a scalar field, along\nwith the closely related quantization method of Dirac. We describe how both\nformalisms apply to the perturbations in a time-dependent background, and how\nexpectation values of gauge-invariant operators can be calculated in the in-in\nformalism. Our analysis focuses mostly on the free theory. By appropriate\ncanonical transformations we simplify and diagonalize the free Hamiltonian.\nBRST quantization in derivative gauges allows us to dramatically simplify the\nstructure of the propagators, whereas quantization in synchronous gauge, which\namounts to Dirac quantization, dispenses with the need to introduce ghosts and\npreserves the locality of the gauge-fixed action.\n", "  A new algorithm for the identification of boosted, hadronically decaying,\nheavy particles at the LHC is presented. The algorithm is based on the known\nprocedure of jet clustering with variable distance parameter $R$ and adapts the\njet size to its transverse momentum $p_T$. Subjets are found using a mass jump\ncondition. The resulting algorithm - called Heavy Object Tagger with Variable\n$R$ (HOTVR) - features little algorithmic complexity and combines jet\nclustering, subjet finding and rejection of soft clusters in one sequence.\nWhile the HOTVR algorithm can be used for the identification of any heavy\nobject decaying hadronically, e.g. W, Z, H, t, or possible new heavy\nresonances, this paper targets specifically the tagging of boosted top quarks.\nThe studies presented here demonstrate a stable performance of the HOTVR\nalgorithm in a wide range of top quark $p_T$, from low $p_T$, where the decay\nproducts can be resolved, to the region of boosted decays at high $p_T$.\n", "  We study a system of two Higgs bound state, interacting via a real scalar\nDark Matter mediating field, without imposing $Z_2$ symmetry on the DM sector\nof the postulated Lagrangian. The variational method in the Hamiltonian\nformalism of QFT is used to derive relativistic wave equations for the\ntwo-Higgs system, using a truncated Fock-space trial state. Approximate\nsolutions of the 2-body relativistic coupled integral equations are presented,\nand conditions for the existence of Higgs bound states is examined in a broad\nparameter space of DM mass and coupling constants.\n", "  The uncertainty principle sets lower bound on the uncertainties of two\nincompatible observables measured on a particle. The uncertainty lower bound\ncan be reduced by considering a particle as a quantum memory entangled with the\nmeasured particle. In this paper, we consider a tripartite scenario in which a\nquantum state has been shared between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The aim of Bob\nand Charlie is to minimize Charlie's lower bound about Alice's measurement\noutcomes. To this aim, they concentrate their correlation with Alice in\nCharlie's side via a cooperative strategy based on local operations and\nclassical communication. We obtain lower bound for Charlie's uncertainty about\nAlice's measurement outcomes after concentrating information and compare it\nwith the lower bound without concentrating information in some examples. We\nalso provide a physical interpretation of the entropic uncertainty lower bound\nbased on the dense coding capacity.\n", "  We present a method to calculate short-time non-equilibrium universal\nexponents within the functional renormalization-group scheme. As an example, we\nconsider the classical critical dynamics of the relaxational model A after a\nquench of the temperature of the system and calculate the initial slip exponent\nwhich characterizes the non-equilibrium universal short-time behaviour of both\nthe order parameter and correlation functions. The value of this exponent is\nfound to be consistent with the result of a perturbative dimensional expansion\nand of Monte Carlo simulations in three spatial dimensions.\n", "  In this article we investigate the time dependence of the gap mode of copper\nnitrate at various temperatures. We combine state-of-the-art theoretical\ncalculations with high precision neutron resonance spin-echo measurements to\nunderstand the anomalous decoherence effects found previously in this material.\nIt is shown that the time domain offers a complementary view on this\nphenomenon, which allows us to directly compare experimental data and\ntheoretical predictions without the need of further intensive data analysis,\nsuch as (de)convolution.\n", "  We have conducted a near-infrared (NIR) proper motion survey, the Sondage\nInfrarouge de Mouvement Propre, in order to discover field ultracool dwarfs\n(UCD) in the solar neighborhood. The survey was conducted by imaging $\\sim28\\%$\nof the sky with the Cam\\'era PAnoramique Proche-InfraRouge both in the southern\nhemisphere at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 1.5 m telescope, and\nin the northern hemisphere at the Observatoire du Mont-M\\'egantic 1.6 m\ntelescope and comparing the source positions from these observations with the\nTwo Micron All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalog (2MASS PSC). Additional color\ncriteria were used to further discriminate unwanted astrophysical sources. We\npresent the results of an NIR spectroscopic follow-up of 169 M, L, and T\ndwarfs. Among the sources discovered are 2 young field brown dwarfs, 6\nunusually red M and L dwarfs, 25 unusually blue M and L dwarfs, 2 candidate\nunresolved L+T binaries, and 24 peculiar UCDs. Additionally, we add 9 L/T\ntransition dwarfs (L6--T4.5) to the already known objects.\n", "  It was recently found that Coulomb interaction can induce a series of\nnontrivial spectral and transport properties in a two-dimensional anisotropic\nWeyl semimetal. Different from graphehe that is basically an ordinary Fermi\nliquid, the Coulomb interaction in this system makes the Fermi liquid\ndescription invalid over a wide range of energy scales. We present a systematic\nrenormalization group analysis of the interplay of Coulomb interaction and\nquenched disorder, and show that they have substantial mutual effects on each\nother, which then leads to a variety of quantum phase transitions and non-Fermi\nliquid behaviors. The low-energy physics of the system depends sensitively on\nthe effective strength of Coulomb interaction and disorder.\n", "  Optomechanical arrays made of structured flexible dielectrics are a promising\nsystem for exploring quantum and many-body optomechanical phenomena. We\ngeneralize investigations of the optomechanical properties of periodic arrays\nof one-dimensional scatterers in optical resonators to the case of vibrating\nmembranes whose thickness is not necessarily small with respect to the optical\nwavelength of interest. The array optical transmission spectrum and its\noptomechanical coupling with a linear Fabry-Perot cavity field are investigated\nboth analytically and numerically.\n", "  We present a calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the\nproduction of Higgs boson pairs in gluon fusion keeping the full dependence on\nthe mass of the top quark. The virtual corrections, involving two-loop\nintegrals with up to four mass scales, have been calculated numerically and we\npresent an efficient algorithm to obtain accurate results of the virtual\namplitude using numerical integrations. Taking the top quark mass into account\nwe obtain significant differences compared to results obtained in the heavy top\nlimit.\n", "  In this paper we study the quantum tunneling of Dirac magnetic monopoles from\nthe global monopole black hole under quantum gravity effects. We start from the\nmodified Maxwell's equations and the Generalized Uncertainty Relation (GUP), to\nrecover the GUP corrected temperature for the global monopole black hole by\nsolving the modified Dirac equation via Hamilton-Jacobi method. Furthermore, we\nalso include the quantum corrections beyond the semiclassical approximation, in\nparticular, first we find the logarithmic corrections of GUP corrected entropy\nand finally we calculate the GUP corrected specific heat capacity. It is argued\nthat the GUP effects may prevent a black hole from complete evaporation and\nleave remnants.\n", "  We investigate the unconventional quantum phase transitions in Weyl\nsemimetals. The emergent boson fields, coupling with the Weyl fermion\nbilinears, contain a Wess-Zumino-Witten term or topological $\\Theta$ term\ninherited from the momentum space monopoles carried by Weyl points. Three types\nof unconventional quantum critical points will be studied in order: (1) The\ntransition between two distinct symmetry breaking phases whose criticality is\nbeyond Landau's paradigm. (2) The transition between a symmetry breaking state\nto a topological ordered state. (3) The transition between $3d$ topological\norder phase to trivial disordered phase whose criticality could be traced back\nto a $Z_2$ symmetry breaking transition in $4d$. The essence of these\nunconventional critical points lies in the fact that the topological defect of\nan order parameter carries either a nontrivial quantum number or a topological\nterm so the condensation of the defects would either break some symmetry or\ngive rise to a topological order phase with nontrivial braiding statistics.\n", "  We introduce three right-handed neutrinos and three sterile neutrinos, and\nconsider an inverse seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation. From\nnaturalness point of view, their Majorana masses should be small, while it\ninduces a large neutrino Yukawa coupling. Then, a neutrinoless double beta\ndecay rate can be enhanced, and a sizable Higgs mass correction is inevitable.\nWe find that the enhancement rate can be more than ten times compared with a\nstandard prediction from light neutrino contribution alone, and an analytic\nform of heavy neutrino contributions to the Higgs mass correction. In addition,\nwe numerically analyze the model, and find almost all parameter space of the\nmodel can be complementarily searched by future experiments of neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay and $\\mu \\to e$ conversion.\n", "  The quantum effects close to the classical big rip singularity within the\nEddington-inspired-Born-Infeld theory (EiBI) are investigated through quantum\ngeometrodynamics. It is the first time that this approach is applied to a\nmodified theory constructed upon Palatini formalism. The Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW)\nequation is obtained and solved based on an alternative action proposed in\nRef.[1], under two different factor ordering choices. This action is\ndynamically equivalent to the original EiBI action while it is free of square\nroot of the spacetime curvature. We consider a homogeneous, isotropic and\nspatially flat universe, which is assumed to be dominated by a phantom perfect\nfluid whose equation of state is a constant. We obtain exact solutions of the\nWDW equation based on some specific conditions. In more general cases, we\npropose a qualitative argument with the help of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\n(WKB) approximation to get further solutions. Besides, we also construct an\neffective WDW equation by simply promoting the classical Friedmann equations.\nWe find that for all the approaches considered, the DeWitt condition hinting\nsingularity avoidance is satisfied. Therefore the big rip singularity can be\navoided through the quantum approach within the EiBI theory.\n", "  Leading HPC systems achieve their status through use of highly parallel\ndevices such as NVIDIA GPUs or Intel Xeon Phi many-core CPUs. The concept of\nperformance portability across such architectures, as well as traditional CPUs,\nis vital for the application programmer. In this paper we describe targetDP, a\nlightweight abstraction layer which allows grid-based applications to target\ndata parallel hardware in a platform agnostic manner. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our pragmatic approach by presenting performance results for a\ncomplex fluid application (with which the model was co-designed), plus a\nseparate lattice QCD particle physics code. For each application, a single\nsource code base is seen to achieve portable performance, as assessed within\nthe context of the Roofline model. TargetDP can be combined with MPI to allow\nuse on systems containing multiple nodes: we demonstrate this through provision\nof scaling results on traditional and GPU-accelerated large scale\nsupercomputers.\n", "  Configurational polyhedora (CP) is a hyperpolyhedra on multidimensional\nconfiguration space, whose vertex (and edges) corresponds to upper or lower\nlimit value of correlation functions for all possible atomic configuration on\ngiven lattice. In classical systems where physical property including internal\nenergy and elastic modulus can be a linear map for structures considered, it is\nknown that atomic configuration having highest (or lowerst) physical quantity\nshould always locate on one of the vertices at absolute zero temperature. The\npresent study extend the idea of CP to finite-temperature property (especially,\nfocusing on internal energy), and successfully provides demonstration of how\ntemperature dependence of internal energy in equilibrium state for alloys is\ninterpreted in terms of the density of states for non-interacting system along\nspecially selected direction on cofiguration space.\n", "  The properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are studied within the\nquark mean field (QMF) model by taking the effects of pion and gluon into\naccount at the quark level. The nucleon is described as the combination of\nthree constituent quarks confined by a harmonic oscillator potential. To\nsatisfy the spirit of QCD theory, the contributions of pion and gluon on the\nnucleon structure are treated in second-order perturbation theory. For the\nnuclear many-body system, nucleons interact with each other by exchanging\nmesons between quarks. With different constituent quark mass, $m_q$, we\ndetermine three parameter sets about the coupling constants between mesons and\nquarks, named as QMF-NK1, QMF-NK2, and QMF-NK3 by fitting the ground-state\nproperties of several closed-shell nuclei. It is found that all of the three\nparameter sets can give satisfactory description on properties of nuclear\nmatter and finite nuclei, meanwhile they can also predict the larger neutron\nstar mass around $2.3M_\\odot$ without the hyperon degrees of freedom.\n", "  The baryon asymmetry of the Universe should have been produced after the\ninflation era. We consider the possibility that the asymmetry is generated by\nthe flavor oscillations in the reheating process after inflation, so that the\nbaryon asymmetry is realized already at the beginning of the radiation\ndominated era. In the seesaw model, we show that the propagators of the\nleft-handed leptons generically have flavor mixings in the thermal background,\nthat can generate flavor-dependent lepton asymmetry through the $CP$ violation\nin the oscillation phenomena. The flavor dependent rates for the wash-out\nprocess can leave the net asymmetry today.\n", "  In a recent paper on electrostatic shielding, Chapman, Hewett and Trefethen\npresent arguments that the analysis of this effect by Feynman is incorrect.\nFeynman analyzed shielding by a row of infinitesimally thin wires. They claim\nthat Feynman used the wrong boundary conditions invalidating his analysis. In\nthis paper we emphasize that Feynman's solution is a Green's function through\nwhich behavior of the potential due to finite thickness wires of arbitrary\ncross-section with appropriate boundary condition can be understood. This shows\nthat the main conclusions of Feynman's treatment are indeed correct. Analogy to\na parallel plate capacitor with one of the plates replaced by a row of wires\nprovides a more intuitive understanding of Feynman's argument. The case of a\nfinite number of wires arranged in a ring (not treated by Feynman), as a model\nof Faraday cage, is different. The structure of the solution in radial\ncoordinates already suggests that one should not expect exponential behavior\nand further analysis confirms this. There appear to be contradictory results in\nthe literature for its screening behavior in the presence of external charges\nor fields.\n", "  To investigate the formation of Mg-based long-period stacking ordered (LPSO)\nstructure, we systematically study the preference of the short-range order\n(SRO) in metastable disordered phases of Mg-RE-Zn (RE = Y, La, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb)\nand Mg-Gd-Al ternary alloy systems through first-principles calculation. RE-Zn\n(RE = Y, Er, Ho, Dy, Tb) and Gd-Al pair clusters' probability showed the\ntendency of increasing. In contrast, La-Zn pair clusters' probability is not\nincreasing, whose system dose not form LPSO structure. This preference of SRO\nin disordered phases of Mg-based ternary alloys certainly indicates that\npeculiar L12-type ordering in LPSO as well as possibility of LPSO formation\nshould have strong correlation with SRO tendency of energetically competitive\ndisordered phases.\n", "  We propose a simple setup for the conversion of multipartite entangled states\nin a quantum network with restricted access. The scheme uses nonlocal\noperations to enable the preparation of states that are inequivalent under\nlocal operations and classical communication, but most importantly does not\nrequire full access to the states. It is based on a flexible linear optical\nconversion gate that uses photons, which are ideally suited for distributed\nquantum computation and quantum communication in extended networks. In order to\nshow the basic working principles of the gate, we focus on converting a\nfour-qubit entangled cluster state to other locally inequivalent four-qubit\nstates, such as the GHZ and symmetric Dicke state. We also show how the gate\ncan be incorporated into extended graph state networks, and can be used to\ngenerate variable entanglement and quantum correlations without entanglement\nbut nonvanishing quantum discord.\n", "  Microgels are soft colloidal particles that, when dispersed in a solvent,\nswell and deswell in response to changes in environmental conditions, such as\ntemperature, concentration, and $p$H. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we model\nbulk suspensions of microgels that interact via Hertzian elastic interparticle\nforces and can expand or contract via trial moves that allow particles to\nchange size in accordance with the Flory-Rehner free energy of cross-linked\npolymer gels. We monitor the influence of particle compressibility, size\nfluctuations, and concentration on bulk structural and thermal properties by\ncomputing particle swelling ratios, radial distribution functions, static\nstructure factors, osmotic pressures, and freezing densities. For microgels in\nthe nanoscale size range, particle compressibility and associated size\nfluctuations suppress crystallization, shifting the freezing transition to a\nhigher density than for the hard-sphere fluid. As densities increase beyond\nclose packing, microgels progressively deswell, while their intrinsic size\ndistribution grows increasingly polydisperse.\n", "  We present measurements of the thermoelectric power of the plutonium-based\nunconventional superconductor PuCoGa$_{5}$. The data is interpreted within a\nphenomenological model for the quasiparticle density of states of intermediate\nvalence systems and the results are compared with results obtained from\nphotoemission spectroscopy. The results are consistent with intermediate\nvalence nature of 5$f$-electrons, furthermore, we propose that measurements of\nthe Seebeck coefficient can be used as a probe of density of states in this\nmaterial, thereby providing a link between transport measurements and\nphotoemission in strongly correlated materials. We discuss these results and\ntheir implications for the electronic structure determination of other strongly\ncorrelated systems, especially actinide materials.\n", "  A major challenge in the theoretical modeling of double-slit interferometry\ninvolving matter-wave fields is the appropriate waveform to be assigned to this\nfield. While all the studies carried out to date on this issue deal with\nvariational fields, experiments suggest that the optical field is generated by\nsplitting a single-hump Bose-Einstein condensate into two spatially and\ntemporally entangled pulses indicating the possibility of fully controlling the\nsubsequent motion of the two output pulses. To probe the consistency of\nvariational and exact soliton solutions to the field equation, we solve the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with an optical potential barrier assumed to act as a\nbeam splitter, while including gravity. The exact solution is compared with the\ntwo most common variational wavefunctions, namely, the Hermite-Gaussian and\nsuper-sech modes. From numerical simulations, evidence is given of the exact\nsolution as being the most appropriate matter-wave structure that provides a\ncoherent description of the generation and spatio-temporal evolution of\nmatter-wave optical fields in a hypothetical implementation of double-slit atom\ninterferometry\n", "  The Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) allow an exploration of the properties of\nPre-Main Sequence(PMS) stars above the low-mass range ($<2{\\rm\\thinspace\nM_{\\odot}}$) and those bordering the high-mass range ($>8{\\rm\\thinspace\nM_{\\odot}}$). This paper is the second in a series exploring accretion in 91\nHAeBes with Very Large Telescope/X-shooter spectra. Equivalent width\nmeasurements are carried out on 32 different lines, spanning the UV to NIR, in\norder to obtain their line luminosities. The line luminosities were compared to\naccretion luminosities, which were determined directly from measurements of an\nUV-excess. When detected, emission lines always demonstrate a correlation with\nthe accretion luminosity, regardless of detection frequency. The average\nrelationship between accretion luminosity and line luminosity is found to be\n${\\thinspace L_{\\rm acc}}\\propto{\\thinspace L_{\\rm line}}^{1.16 \\pm 0.15}$.\nThis is in agreement with the findings in Classical T Tauri stars, although the\nHAeBe relationship is generally steeper, particularly towards the Herbig Be\nmass range. Since all observed lines display a correlation with the accretion\nluminosity, all of them can be used as accretion tracers. This has increased\nthe number of accretion diagnostic lines in HAeBes tenfold. However, questions\nstill remain on the physical origin of each line, which may not be due to\naccretion.\n", "  The quasar 3C~286 is one of two compact steep spectrum sources detected by\nthe {\\it Fermi}/LAT. Here, we investigate the radio properties of the\nparsec(pc)-scale jet and its (possible) association with the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission in 3C~286. The Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) images at\nvarious frequencies reveal a one-sided core--jet structure extending to the\nsouthwest at a projected distance of $\\sim$1 kpc. The component at the jet base\nshowing an inverted spectrum is identified as the core, with a mean brightness\ntemperature of $2.8\\times 10^{9}$~K. The jet bends at about 600 pc (in\nprojection) away from the core, from a position angle of $-135^\\circ$ to\n$-115^\\circ$. Based on the available VLBI data, we inferred the proper motion\nspeed of the inner jet as $0.013 \\pm 0.011$ mas yr$^{-1}$ ($\\beta_{\\rm app} =\n0.6 \\pm 0.5$), corresponding to a jet speed of about $0.5\\,c$ at an inclination\nangle of $48^\\circ$ between the jet and the line of sight of the observer. The\nbrightness temperature, jet speed and Lorentz factor are much lower than those\nof $\\gamma$-ray-emitting blazars, implying that the pc-scale jet in 3C~286 is\nmildly relativistic. Unlike blazars in which $\\gamma$-ray emission is in\ngeneral thought to originate from the beamed innermost jet, the location and\nmechanism of $\\gamma$-ray emission in 3C~286 may be different as indicated by\nthe current radio data. Multi-band spectrum fitting may offer a complementary\ndiagnostic clue of the $\\gamma$-ray production mechanism in this source.\n", "  We consider a sharp-interface approach for the inviscid isothermal dynamics\nof compressible two-phase flow, that accounts for phase transition and surface\ntension effects. To fix the mass exchange and entropy dissipation rate across\nthe interface kinetic relations are frequently used. The complete\nuni-directional dynamics can then be understood by solving generalized\ntwo-phase Riemann problems. We present new well-posedness theorems for the\nRiemann problem and corresponding computable Riemann solvers, that cover quite\ngeneral equations of state, metastable input data and curvature effects. The\nnew Riemann solver is used to validate different kinetic relations on\nphysically relevant problems including a comparison with experimental data.\nRiemann solvers are building blocks for many numerical schemes that are used to\ntrack interfaces in two-phase flow. It is shown that the new Riemann solver\nenables reliable and efficient computations for physical situations that could\nnot be treated before.\n", "  In order to study the response of the quantum chromodynamic matter to finite\nelectromagnetic fields, we utilize the Polyakov linear - sigma model (PLSM) in\nmean-field approximation. Due to participants' momentum imbalance and\noff-center relativistic motion of the spectators' electric charges, localized,\nshort-lived, huge electromagnetic fields are to be generated in the\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions. We report on various electromagnetic and\ntransport properties of the new-state-of matter; the quark-gluon plasma (QGP)\nwithin the QCD-like approach, PLSM. We find an excellent agreement between our\nPLSM calculations and various recent lattice QCD simulations and notice that\nthe magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility and the relative permeability\nobviously increase in the QGP phase. We predict that increasing the magnetic\nfield remarkable decreases the viscosity, especially in hadron phase. while in\nQGP phase, the viscous properties seem not being affected with.\n", "  In mean-field approximation, the SU($4$) Polyakov linear - sigma model (PLSM)\nis constructed in order to characterize the quark-hadron phase structure in a\nwide range of temperatures and densities. The chiral condensates $\\sigma_l$,\n$\\sigma_s$ and $\\sigma_c$ for light, strange and charm quarks, respectively,\nand the deconfinement order-parameters $\\phi$ and $\\phi^*$ shall be analyzed at\nfinite temperatures and densities. We conclude that the critical temperatures\ncorresponding to charm condensates are greater than that to strange and light\nones, respectively. Thus, the charm condensates are likely not affected by the\nQCD phase transition. Furthermore, increasing the chemical potentials decreases\nthe corresponding critical temperatures.\n", "  Large variety of structure and chemical-composition of reduced graphene oxide\n(RGO) is explained from a quantum-chemical standpoint. The related molecular\ntheory of graphene oxide, supported by large experience gained by the modern\ngraphene science, has led the foundation of the concept of a multi-stage\ngraphene oxide reduction. This microscopic approach has found a definite\nconfirmation when analyzing the available empirical data concerning both\nsynthetic and natural RGO products, the latter in view of shungite carbon,\nsuggesting the atomic-microscopic model for its structure.\n", "  In these proceedings we highlight the primary scientific goals and design of\nthe WEAVE-LOFAR survey, which will use the new WEAVE spectrograph on the 4.2m\nWilliam Herschel Telescope to provide the primary source of spectroscopic\ninformation for the LOFAR Surveys Key Science Project. Beginning in 2018,\nWEAVE-LOFAR will generate more than 10$^6$ R=5000 365-960 nm spectra of\nlow-frequency selected radio sources, across three tiers designed to\nefficiently sample the redshift-luminosity plane, and produce a data set of\nenormous legacy value. The radio frequency selection, combined with the high\nmultiplex and throughput of the WEAVE spectrograph, make obtaining redshifts in\nthis way very efficient, and we expect that the redshift success rate will\napproach 100 per cent at $z < 1$. This unprecedented spectroscopic sample -\nwhich will be complemented by an integral field component - will be\ntransformational in key areas, including studying the star formation history of\nthe Universe, the role of accretion and AGN-driven feedback, properties of the\nepoch of reionisation, cosmology, cluster haloes and relics, as well as the\nnature of radio galaxies and protoclusters. Each topic will be addressed in\nunprecedented detail, and with the most reliable source classifications and\nredshift information in existence.\n", "  We have developed a new model for the astrochemical structure of a viscously\nevolving protoplanetary disk that couples an analytic description of the disk's\ntemperature and density profile, chemical evolution, and an evolving dust\ndistribution. We compute evolving radial distributions for a range of dust\ngrain sizes, which depend on coagulation, fragmentation and radial drift\nprocesses. In particular we find that the water ice line plays an important\nrole in shaping the radial distribution of the maximum grain size because ice\ncoated grains are significantly less susceptible to fragmentation than their\ndry counterparts. This in turn has important effects on disk ionization and\ntherefore on the location of dead zones. In comparison to a simple constant\ngas-to-dust ratio model for the dust as an example, we find that the new model\npredicts an outer dead zone edge that moves in by a factor of about 3 at 1 Myr\n(to 5 AU) and by a factor of about 14 by 3 Myr (to 0.5 AU). We show that the\nchanging position of the dead zone and heat transition traps have important\nimplications for the formation and trapping of planets in protoplanetary disks.\nFinally, we consider our results in light of recent ALMA observations of HL Tau\nand TW Hya.\n", "  We studied charge transport phenomena through a core substituted\nnaphthalenediimide (NDI) single-molecule junctions using the electrochemical\nSTM-based break junction technique in combination with DFT calculations. The\nconductance switch among three well-defined states is acquired by\nelectrochemically controlling the redox state of the pendent diimide unit of\nthe molecule in ionic liquid, and the conductance difference is more than one\norder of magnitude between di-anion states and neutral state. The potential\ndependent charge transport characteristics of the NDI molecules are confirmed\nby DFT calculations accounting for electrochemical double-layer effects on the\nconductance of the NDI junctions. This work suggests that the integration of\nredox unit in the pendent position with strong coupling to molecular backbone\ncan significantly tune the charge transport of the single-molecule device by\ncontrolling different redox states.\n", "  Twelve single chambered, air-cathode Tubular Microbial Fuel Cells (TMFCs)\nhave been filled up with fruit and vegetable residues. The anodes were realized\nby means of a carbon fiber brush, while the cathodes were realized through a\ngraphite-based porous ceramic disk with Nafion membranes (117 Dupont). The\nperformances in terms of polarization curves and power production were assessed\naccording to different operating conditions: percentage of solid substrate\nwater dilution, adoption of freshwater and a 35mg/L NaCl water solution and,\nfinally, the effect of an initial potentiostatic growth.\n  All TMFCs operated at low pH (pH$=3.0 \\pm 0.5$), as no pH amendment was\ncarried out. Despite the harsh environmental conditions, our TMFCs showed a\nPower Density (PD) ranging from 20 to 55~mW/m$^2 \\cdot$kg$_{\\text{waste}}$ and\na maximum CD of 20~mA/m$^2 \\cdot$kg$_{\\text{waste}}$, referred to the cathodic\nsurface. COD removal after a $28-$day period was about $45 \\%$.\n  The remarkably low pH values as well as the fouling of Nafion membrane very\nlikely limited TMFC performances. However, a scale-up estimation of our\nreactors provides interesting values in terms of power production, compared to\nactual anaerobic digestion plants. These results encourage further studies to\ncharacterize the graphite-based porous ceramic cathodes and to optimize the\nglobal TMFC performances, as they may provide a valid and sustainable\nalternative to anaerobic digestion technologies.\n", "  The meaning of the wave function has been a hot topic of debate since the\nearly days of quantum mechanics. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest\nin this long-standing question. Is the wave function ontic, directly\nrepresenting a state of reality, or epistemic, merely representing a state of\n(incomplete) knowledge, or something else? If the wave function is not ontic,\nthen what, if any, is the underlying state of reality? If the wave function is\nindeed ontic, then exactly what physical state does it represent? In this book,\nI aim to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and find the\nontological content of the theory. The book can be divided into three parts.\nThe first part addresses the question of the nature of the wave function\n(Chapters 1-5). After giving a comprehensive and critical review of the\ncompeting views of the wave function, I present a new argument for the ontic\nview in terms of protective measurements. In addition, I also analyze the\norigin of the wave function by deriving the free Schroedinger equation. The\nsecond part analyzes the ontological meaning of the wave function (Chapters 6,\n7). I propose a new ontological interpretation of the wave function in terms of\nrandom discontinuous motion of particles, and give two main arguments\nsupporting this interpretation. The third part investigates whether the\nsuggested quantum ontology is complete in accounting for our definite\nexperience and whether it needs to be revised in the relativistic domain\n(Chapters 8, 9).\n", "  Metal meshes have emerged as an important class of flexible transparent\nelectrodes. We report on the characteristics of a new class of asymmetric\nmeshes, tiled using a recently-discovered family of pentagons. Micron-scale\nmeshes were fabricated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrates via\noptical lithography, metal evaporation (Ti 10 nm, Pt 50 nm) and lift-off. Three\ndifferent designs were assessed, each with the same tessellation pattern and\nlinewidth (5 micron), but with different sizes of the fundamental pentagonal\nunit. The designs corresponded to areal coverage of the metal patterns of 27%\n(Design#1), 14% (Design#2) and 9% (Design#3), respectively. Good mechanical\nstability was observed for both tensile strain and compressive strain. After\n1,000 bending cycles, devices subjected to tensile strain showed fractional\nresistance increases in the range 8% to 17% with the lowest changes observed\nfor Design#2. Devices subjected to compressive strain showed fractional\nresistance increases in the range 0% to 7% with best results observed for\nDesign#1. The performance of the pentagonal metal mesh devices as visible\ntransparent heaters via Joule heating was also assessed. A saturation\ntemperature of 88 +/- 1 degrees C was achieved at low voltage (5 V) with a fast\nresponse time (~ 20 s) and a high thermal resistance (168 +/- 6 degrees C\ncm2/W). Finally, de-icing was successfully demonstrated (45 s at 5 V) for an\nice layer on a glass coupon placed on top of the PET substrate.\n", "  We investigated long-wavelength nematic fluctuations in an Fe-based\nsuperconductor LiFeAs near q=(0.05,0,0) by measuring temperature-dependent\nrenormalization of acoustic phonons through inelastic neutron scattering. We\nfound that the phonons have conventional behavior, as would be expected in the\nabsence of electronic nematic fluctuations. This observation implies that\neither electron-phonon coupling is too weak to see any effect or that nematic\nfluctuations are not present.\n", "  We present the formulation and implementation of the integral- and\nintermediate-screened coupled-cluster method (ISSCC). The IISCC method gives a\nsimple and rigorous integral and intermediate screening (IIS) of the\ncoupled-cluster method and will significantly reduces the scaling for all\norders of the CC hierarchy exactly like seen for the integral-screened\nconfiguration-interaction method (ISCI). The rigorous IIS in the IISCC gives a\nrobust and adjustable error control which should allow for the possibility of\nconverging the energy without any loss of accuracy while retaining low or\nlinear scaling at the same time. The derivation of the IISCC is performed in a\nsimilar fashion as in the ISCI where we show that the tensor contractions for\nthe nested commutators are separable up to an overall sign and that this\nseparability can lead to a rigorous IIS. In the nested commutators the\nintegrals are screened in the first tensor contraction and the intermediates\nare screened in all successive tensor contractions. The rigorous IIS will lead\nto linear scaling for all nested commutators for large systems in a similar way\nas seen for the ISCI. The reduced scaling can in this way be obtained without\nany range dependent parameter for the interaction, unlike other low scaling\nmethods and is therefore also suitable for charge separated systems. It is\nexpected that the IISCC, just like the ISCI, can use dramatically larger\norbital spaces combined with large CC expansions as compared with traditional\nCC methods. Due to the size extensive nature of the CC method the IISCC should\nnot only be applicable to few electron systems but also to large molecular\nsystem unlike the ISCI. The IISCC can here either be used as a stand alone\nmethod or combined with other linear scaling approaches like the fragmentation\nmethod or other methods which introduces a range dependent interaction\nscreening.\n", "  The giant impact hypothesis is the dominant theory explaining the formation\nof our Moon. However, its inability to produce an isotopically similar\nEarth-Moon system with correct angular momentum has cast a shadow on its\nvalidity. Computer-generated impacts have been successful in producing virtual\nsystems that possess many of the physical properties we observe. Yet,\naddressing the isotopic similarities between the Earth and Moon coupled with\ncorrect angular momentum has proven to be challenging. Equilibration and\nevection resonance have been put forth as a means of reconciling the models.\nHowever, both were rejected in a meeting at The Royal Society in London. The\nmain concern was that models were multi-staged and too complex. Here, we\npresent initial impact conditions that produce an Earth-Moon system whose\nangular momentum and isotopic properties are correct. The model is\nstraightforward and the results are a natural consequence of the impact.\n", "  Electromagnetic (EM) waves with helical wavefront carry orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM), which is associated with the azimuthal phase of the complex\nelectric field. OAM is a new degree of freedom in EM waves and is promising for\nchannel multiplexing in communication system. Although the OAM-carrying EM wave\nattracts more and more attention, the method of OAM generation at microwave\nfrequencies still faces challenges, such as efficiency and simulation time. In\nthis work, by using the circuit theory and equivalence principle, we build two\nsimplified models, one for a single scatter and one for the whole metasurface\nto predict their EM responses. Both of the models significantly simplify the\ndesign procedure and reduce the simulation time. In this paper, we propose an\nultrathin complementary metasurface that converts a left-handed (right-handed)\ncircularly polarized plane wave without OAM to a right-handed (left-handed)\ncircularly polarized wave with OAM of arbitrary orders and a high transmission\nefficiency can be achieved.\n", "  Bright-rimmed clouds (BRCs) are formed at the periphery of H$~$II regions as\nthe radiation from the central star interacts with dense gas. The ionization\nand resulting compression of the clouds may lead to cloud disruption causing\nsecondary star formation depending on the stellar and gas parameters. Here we\nuse R-band polarimetry to probe the plane-of-the sky magnetic field in the two\nnear-by BRCs IC\\,59 and IC\\,63. Both nebulae are illuminated by $\\gamma$ Cas\nwith the direction of ionizing radiation being orientated parallel or\nperpendicular to the local magnetic field, allowing us to probe the importance\nof magnetic field pressure in the evolution of BRCs. Because of the proximity\nof the system ($\\sim$200pc) we have acquired a substantial sample of over 500\npolarization measurements for stars background to the nebulae. On large scales,\nthe magnetic field geometries of both clouds are anchored to the ambient\nmagnetic field. For IC 63, the magnetic field is aligned parallel to the\nhead-tail morphology of the main condensation, with convex morphology relative\nto the direction of the ionizing radiation. We estimate the plane of the sky\nmagnetic field strength in IC\\,63 to be $\\sim90\\mu$G. In IC\\,59, the projected\nmagnetic field follows the M shape morphology of the cloud. Here, field lines\npresent a concave shape with respect to the direction of the ionizing radiation\nfrom $\\gamma$ Cas. Comparing our observations to published theoretical models\nwe find good general agreement, supporting the importance of magnetic fields in\nBRC evolution.\n", "  In relation to the newly observed bottom-strange X^{+,-}(5568) mesons, we\nrevisit our tetra-quark interpretation of X(3872) and Z_c(3900). It is\ndiscussed that our assignment of X^{+,-}(5568) to charged components of\niso-triplet bottom partners of D_{s0}^+(2317) is compatible with the revised\nversion of our tetra-quark interpretation of X(3872) and Z_c(3900).\n", "  Most major discoveries in astronomy have come from unplanned discoveries made\nby surveying the Universe in a new way, rather than by testing a hypothesis or\nconducting an investigation with planned outcomes. Next generation radio\ncontinuum surveys such as the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU: the radio\ncontinuum survey on the new Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope), will\nsignificantly expand the volume of observational phase space, so we can be\nreasonably confident that we will stumble across unexpected new phenomena or\nnew types of object. However, the complexity of the instrument and the large\ndata volumes mean that it may be non-trivial to identify them. On the other\nhand, if we don't, then we may be missing out on the most exciting science\nresults from EMU. We have therefore started a project called \"WTF\", which\nexplicitly aims to mine EMU data to discover unexpected science that is not\npart of our primary science goals, using a variety of machine-learning\ntechniques and algorithms. Although targeted specifically at EMU, we expect\nthis approach will have broad applicability to astronomical survey data.\n", "  We develop an advanced analytical model for calculating the broadband\nstripline ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response for metallic ferromagnetic\nfilms, taking into account the exchange interaction as well as the exchange\nboundary conditions at the film surface. This approach leads to simple\nanalytical expressions in the Fourier space. As a result, a numerical code\nwhich implements inverse Fourier transform of these equations is very quick.\nThis allows us to explore a wide space of parameters as numerical examples of\napplication of this theory. In particular, we investigate the joint effect of\nmicrowave eddy current shielding and magnetisation pinning at the ferromagnetic\nfilm surfaces on the shape of the stripline FMR response of the film.\n", "  Si doped ZnO has been reported to be a better conductor than pure ZnO. It is\nreported that carrier density increases and hence conductivity increases.\nHowever, the effect on optical transmission is yet not clear until our recent\nreport [1]. Zn1-xSixO for x= 0, 0.013, 0.020 and 0.027 have been synthesized\nusing sol-gel method (a citric acid-glycerol route) followed by solid state\nsintering. We found that there is a decrease in defect states due to Si doping.\nThe correlation of strain to the decrement in vacancy sites is discussed in\nthis report. In modern electronics and solar cell fabrication, transparent\nconductive oxides (TCOs) are important components which conduct electrically\nwithout absorbing visible light. Known TCOs are extremely costly and are\ncomposed of non-abundant elements. Search for new ecofriendly, cheap and\nsustainable TCOs has been a recent research of attraction. Keeping in mind that\nmost solar cells are exposed to natural conditions, the humidity tolerance\nbecomes a determining factor. We report that sensitivity to moisture decreases\ndrastically while the conductivity and optical transparency increases with\ndoping. The reduction of strain and improvement of transport properties results\nin increased conductivity of Si doped ZnO pellets, tempting us to envisage this\nmaterial as a probable alternate TCO.\n", "  A core prediction of natural Supersymmetry is the existence of four light\nhiggsinos not too far above the mass of the $Z$ boson. The small mass\nsplittings amongst the higgsinos -- typically 5-20\\,GeV -- imply very little\nvisible energy release from decays of heavier higgsinos. In particular, if\nother SUSY particles are quite heavy, as can be the case in SUSY with\nradiatively-driven naturalness, the higgsinos are extremely hard to detect at\nhadron colliders. The clean environment of electron-positron colliders with\n$\\sqrt{s} > 2m_{\\mathrm{higgsino}}$, however, would allow for a decisive search\nfor the required light higgsinos. Thus, $e^+e^-$ colliders should either\ndiscover or exclude natural SUSY. We present a detailed study of higgsino pair\nproduction at the proposed International Linear $e^+e^-$ Collider which is\nunder consideration for construction in Japan. A variety of precision\nmeasurements should allow for extraction of underlying parameters and provide a\nwindow onto physics at the grand unified scale.\n", "  Changes in strain can be used to modify electronic and magnetic properties in\ncrystal structures, to manipulate nanoparticles and cells, or to control\nchemical reactions. The magneto-elastic (ME) effect--the change of magnetic\nproperties caused by the elastic deformation (strain) of a magnetic\nmaterial--has been proposed as an alternative approach to magnetic fields for\nthe low power control of magnetization states of nanoelements since it avoids\ncharge currents, which entail ohmic losses. Multiferroic heterostructures\n\\cite{Zheng2004} and nanocomposites have exploited this effect in search of\nelectric control of magnetic states, mostly in the static regime. Quantitative\nstudies combining strain and magnetization dynamics are needed for practical\napplications and so far, a high resolution technique for this has been lacking.\nHere, we have studied the effect of the dynamic strain accompanying a surface\nacoustic wave on magnetic nanostructures. We have simultaneously imaged the\ntemporal evolution of both strain waves and magnetization dynamics of\nnanostructures at the picosecond timescale. The newly developed experimental\ntechnique, based on X-ray microscopy, is versatile and provides a pathway to\nthe study of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale. Our results provide\nfundamental insight in the coupling between strain and magnetization in\nnanostructures at the picosecond timescale, having implications in the design\nof strain-controlled magnetostrictive nano-devices.\n", "  We consider a chain of weakly harmonic coupled oscillators perturbed by a\nconservative noise. We show that by tuning accordingly the coupling constant\nenergy can diffuse like a Brownian motion or superdiffuse like a maximally\n3/2-stable asymmetric L{\\'e}vy process. For a critical value of the coupling,\nthe energy diffusion is described by a family of L{\\'e}vy processes which\ninterpolates between these two processes.\n", "  The gas phase structure and excited state lifetime of the\np-aminophenol...p-cresol heterodimer have been investigated by REMPI and LIF\nspectroscopy with nanosecond laser pulses and pump-probe experiments with\npicosecond laser pulses as a model system to study the competition between p-p\nand H-bonding interactions in aromatic dimers. The excitation is a broad and\nunstructured band. The excitedstate of the heterodimer is long lived (2.5 +/-\n0.5) ns with a very broad fluorescence spectrum red-shifted by 4000 cm^{-1}\nwith respect to the excitation spectrum. Calculations at the MP2/RI-CC2 and\nDFT-oB97X-D levels indicate that hydrogen-bonded (HB) and p-stacked isomers are\nalmost isoenergetic in the ground state while in the excited state only the\np-stacked isomer exists. This suggests that the HB isomer cannot be excited due\nto negligible Franck-Condon factors and therefore the excitation spectrum is\nassociated with the p-stacked isomer that reaches vibrationally excited states\nin the S1 state upon vertical excitation. The excited state structure is an\nexciplex responsible for the fluorescence of the complex. Finally,a comparison\nwas performed between the p-stacked structure observed for the\np-aminophenol...p-cresol heterodimer and the HB structure reported for the\n(p-cresol)2 homodimer indicating that the differences are due to different\noptical properties (oscillator strengths and Franck-Condon factors) of the\nisomers of both dimers and not to the interactions involved in the ground state\n", "  In the past few years there has been a surge in the material science\nengineering in order to synthesize bulk insulating and surface metallic\nTopological Insulating (TI) materials. This quest is not only theoretically\nimportant but also promising from the novel application perspective. The\ndependence of temperature on resistance (R-T) of a particular sample reveals a\nplethora of information about the electronic properties especially in a unique\nsample like TI where there are two components comprising of an insulating bulk\nand metallic surface states. Depending on the amount of intrinsic doping during\nthe sample formation, the bulk can either couple or remain decoupled with the\nsurface. The former leads to a metallic R-T profile whereas the latter is\ncaptured by an insulating R-T behavior. These two behaviors can be represented\nby series and parallel resistor models respectively. In this work we study the\nR-T behavior in the framework of resistor models capturing the essential\nfeatures of our sample.\n", "  Optical frequency comb (OFC) technology has been the cornerstone for\nscientific breakthroughs such as precision frequency metrology, redefinition of\ntime, extreme light-matter interaction, and attosecond sciences. While the\ncurrent mode-locked laser-based OFC has had great success in extending the\nscientific frontier, its use in real-world applications beyond the laboratory\nsetting remains an unsolved challenge. Microresonator-based OFCs, or Kerr\nfrequency comb, have recently emerged as a candidate solution to the challenge\nbecause of their preferable size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP). On the\nother hand, the current phase stabilization technology requires either external\noptical references or power-demanding nonlinear processes, overturning the SWaP\nbenefit of Kerr frequency combs. Introducing a new concept in phase control,\nhere we report an internally phase stabilized Kerr frequency comb without the\nneed of any optical references or nonlinear processes. We describe the comb\ngeneration analytically with the theory of cavity induced modulation\ninstability, and demonstrate for the first time that the optical frequency can\nbe stabilized by control of two internally accessible parameters: an intrinsic\ncomb offset and the comb spacing. Both parameters are phase locked to microwave\nreferences, with 55 mrad and 20 mrad residual phase noises, and the resulting\ncomb-to-comb frequency uncertainty is 0.08 Hz or less. Out-of-loop measurements\nconfirm good coherence and stability across the comb, with measured optical\nfrequency fractional instabilities of 5x10^-11/sqrt(t). The new phase\nstabilization method preserves the Kerr frequency comb's key advantages and\npotential for chip-scale electronic and photonic integration.\n", "  In this work we focus on magnetic relaxation in Mn$_{80}$Ir$_{20}$(12 nm)/\nCu(6 nm)/ Py($d_\\mathrm{F}$) antiferromagnet/Cu/ferromagnet (AFM/Cu/FM)\nmultilayers with different thickness of the ferromagnetic permalloy layer. An\neffective FM-AFM interaction mediated via the conduction electrons in the\nnonmagnetic Cu spacer -- the spin-pumping effect -- is detected as an increase\nin the linewidth of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectra and a shift of\nthe resonant magnetic field. We further find experimentally that the\nspin-pumping-induced contribution to the linewidth is inversely proportional to\nthe thickness of the Py layer. We show that this thickness dependence likely\noriginates from the dissipative dynamics of the free and localized spins in the\nAFM layer. The results obtained could be used for tailoring the dissipative\nproperties of spintronic devices incorporating antiferromagnetic layers.\n", "  We investigate the formation of long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) structure\nfor Mg-Y-Zn ternary alloys based on the short-range order (SRO) tendency of\nenergetically competitive disordered phases. We find that unisotropic SRO\ntendencies for structures with stacking faults cannot be simply interpreted by\narithmetic average of SRO for constituent fcc and hcp stackings, indicating\nthat the SRO should be significantly affected by periodically-introduced\nstacking faults. We also find that SRO for neighboring Y-Zn pair, which should\nhave positive sign to form specific L12 type cluster found in LPSO, is strongly\naffected by the distance between stacking faults: e.g., five atomic layer\ndistance does not prefer in-plane Y-Zn pair, while seven atomic layer distance\nprefer both in- and inter-plane Y-Zn pair. These facts strongly indicate that\nordering tendency for the Mg-Y-Zn alloy is significantly dominated by the\nstacking faults as well as their periodicity. We also systematically\ninvestigate correlation between SRO for other Mg-RE-Zn (RE = La, Tb, Dy, Ho,\nEr) alloys and the physical property of RE elements. We find that while SRO for\nRE-Zn pair does not show effective correlation with atomic radius, it has\nstrong quadratic correlation with atomic radius considering unisotoropy along\nin- and inter-plane directions.\n", "  A multi-wavelength investigation of the star forming complex IRAS 20286+4105,\nlocated in the Cygnus-X region, is presented here. Near-infrared K-band data is\nused to revisit the cluster / stellar group identified in previous studies. The\nradio continuum observations, at 610 and 1280 MHz show the presence of a HII\nregion possibly powered by a star of spectral type B0 - B0.5. The cometary\nmorphology of the ionized region is explained by invoking the bow-shock model\nwhere the likely association with a nearby supernova remnant is also explored.\nA compact radio knot with non-thermal spectral index is detected towards the\ncentre of the cloud. Mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Legacy Survey of the\nCygnus-X region show the presence of six Class I YSOs inside the cloud. Thermal\ndust emission in this complex is modelled using Herschel far-infrared data to\ngenerate dust temperature and column density maps. Herschel images also show\nthe presence of two clumps in this region, the masses of which are estimated to\nbe {\\sim} 175 M{\\sun} and 30 M{\\sun}. The mass-radius relation and the surface\ndensity of the clumps do not qualify them as massive star forming sites. An\noverall picture of a runaway star ionizing the cloud and a triggered population\nof intermediate-mass, Class I sources located toward the cloud centre emerges\nfrom this multiwavelength study. Variation in the dust emissivity spectral\nindex is shown to exist in this region and is seen to have an inverse relation\nwith the dust temperature.\n", "  An efficient perturbational treatment of spin-orbit coupling within the\nframework of high-level multi-reference techniques has been implemented in the\nmost recent version of the COLUMBUS quantum chemistry package, extending the\nexisting fully variational two-component (2c) multi-reference configuration\ninteraction singles and doubles (MRCISD) method. The proposed scheme follows\nrelated implementations of quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) model\nspace techniques. Our model space is built either from uncontracted,\nlarge-scale scalar relativistic MRCISD wavefunctions or based on the\nscalar-relativistic solutions of the linear-response-theory-based\nmulti-configurational averaged quadratic coupled cluster method (LRT-MRAQCC).\nThe latter approach allows for a consistent, approximatively size-consistent\nand size-extensive treatment of spin-orbit coupling. The approach is described\nin detail and compared to a number of related techniques. The inherent accuracy\nof the QDPT approach is validated by comparing cuts of the potential energy\nsurfaces of acrolein and its S, Se, and Te analoga with the corresponding data\nobtained from matching fully variational spin-orbit MRCISD calculations. The\nconceptual availability of approximate analytic gradients with respect to\ngeometrical displacements is an attractive feature of the 2c-QDPT-MRCISD and\n2c-QDPT-LRT-MRAQCC methods for structure optimization and ab inito molecular\ndynamics simulations.\n", "  The cross-sections of prompt gamma-ray production from $^{nat}$Sn and\n$^{nat}$C elements induced by 14.1-MeV neutrons were measured. The\ntime-of-flight technique was used for n-gamma discrimination. The experimental\nresults were compared with theoretical calculations performed by Empire 3.2 and\nTalys 1.6 codes using different models for photon strength function and nuclear\nlevel density.\n", "  We study the condensation transition of counterions on a charged cylinder via\nMonte Carlo simulations. Varying the cylinder radius systematically in relation\nto the system size, we find that all counterions are bound to the cylinder and\nthe heat capacity shows a drop at a finite Manning parameter. A finite-size\nscaling analysis is carried out to confirm the criticality of the complete\ncondensation transition, yielding the same critical exponents with the Manning\ntransition. We show that the existence of the complete condensation is\nessential to explain how the condensation nature alters from continuous to\ndiscontinuous transition.\n", "  The critical relaxation from the low-temperature ordered state of the\nthree-dimensional fully frustrated Ising model on a simple cubic lattice has\nbeen studied using the short time dynamics method. Particles with the periodic\nboundary conditions containing N = 262144 spins have been studied. Calculations\nhave been performed by the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm. The\nstatic critical exponents of the magnetization and correlation radius have been\nobtained. The dynamic critical exponent of the model under study has been\ncalculated.\n", "  Chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) is a key indicator to study plant physiology or\nphotosynthesis efficiency. Conventionally, CF is characterized by fluorometers,\nwhich only allows ensemble measurement through wide-field detection. For\nimaging fluorometers, the typical spatial and temporal resolutions are on the\norder of millimeter and second, far from enough to study cellular/sub-cellular\nCF dynamics. In addition, due to the lack of optical sectioning capability,\nconventional imaging fluorometers cannot identify CF from a single cell or even\na single chloroplast. Here we demonstrated a novel fluorometer based on\nconfocal imaging, that not only provides high contrast images, but also allows\nCF measurement with spatiotemporal resolution as high as micrometer and\nmillisecond. CF transient (the Kautsky curve) from a single chloroplast is\nsuccessfully obtained, with both the temporal dynamics and the intensity\ndependences corresponding well to the ensemble measurement from conventional\nstudies. The significance of confocal imaging fluorometer is to identify the\nvariation among individual chloroplasts, e.g. the half-life period of the slow\ndecay in the Kautsky curve, that is not possible to analyze with wide-field\ntechniques. A linear relationship is found between excitation Intensity and the\ntemporal positions of peaks/valleys in the Kautsky curve. In addition, an\ninteresting 6-order increase in excitation intensity is found between\nwide-field and confocal fluorometers, whose pixel integration time and optical\nsectioning may account for this substantial difference. Confocal imaging\nfluorometers provide micrometer and millisecond CF characterization, opening up\nunprecedented possibilities toward detailed spatiotemporal analysis of CF\ntransients and its propagation dynamics, as well as photosynthesis efficiency\nanalysis, on the scale of organelles, in a living plant.\n", "  The dynamics of dust and gas can be quite different from each other when the\ndust is poorly coupled to the gas. In protoplanetary discs, it is well known\nthat this decoupling of the dust and gas can lead to diverse spatial structures\nand dust-to-gas ratios. In this paper, we study the dynamics of dust and gas\nduring the earlier phase of protostellar collapse, before a protoplanetary disc\nis formed. We find that for dust grains with sizes < 10 micron, the dust is\nwell coupled during the collapse of a rotating, pre-stellar core and there is\nlittle variation of the dust-to-gas ratio during the collapse. However, if\nlarger grains are present, they may have trajectories that are very different\nfrom the gas during the collapse, leading to mid-plane settling and/or\noscillations of the dust grains through the mid-plane. This may produce\nvariations in the dust-to-gas ratio and very different distributions of large\nand small dust grains at the very earliest stages of star formation, if large\ngrains are present in pre-stellar cores.\n", "  In the complex Langevin approach to lattice simulations at nonzero density,\nzeroes of the fermion determinant lead to a meromorphic drift and hence a need\nto revisit the theoretical derivation. We discuss how poles in the drift affect\nthe formal justification of the approach and then explore the various potential\nissues in simple models, in a manner that is applicable to heavy dense and full\nQCD.\n", "  Lattice QCD at non-vanishing chemical potential is studied using the complex\nLangevin equation (CLE). One of the conditions for the correctness of the\nresults of the CLE is that the zeroes of the measure coming from the fermionic\ndeterminant are outside of the distribution of the configurations, or at least\nin a region where support for the distribution is very much suppressed. We\ninvestigate this issue for Heavy Dense QCD (HDQCD) and full QCD at high\ntemperatures. In HDQCD it is found that the configurations move closest to the\nzeroes of the measure around the critical chemical potential of the onset\ntransition, where the sign problem is diminished, but results remain largely\nunaffected. In full QCD at high temperatures the investigation of the spectrum\nof the Dirac operator yields a similar observation: the results are unaffected\nby the issue of the poles.\n", "  Searches in CMS for dark matter in final states with invisible particles\nrecoiling against jets, top, W, Z, photon, and Higgs are presented. Various\ntopologies are explored, covering several specific dark-matter production\nmodes. The summary in a simplified-model framework of various searches for\ndirect dark matter production with the CMS detector is discussed, highlighting\nsensitivities of the analyses under various assumptions of DM production.\n", "  Excitation spectra of $^{11}$C were measured in the $^{12}$C$(p,d)$ reaction\nnear the $\\eta'$ emission threshold. A proton beam extracted from the\nsynchrotron SIS-18 at GSI with an incident energy of 2.5 GeV impinged on a\ncarbon target. The momenta of deuterons emitted at 0 degrees were precisely\nmeasured with the fragment separator FRS operated as a spectrometer. In\ncontrast to theoretical predictions on the possible existence of deeply bound\n$\\eta'$ mesic states in carbon nuclei, no distinct structures were observed\nassociated with the formation of bound states. The spectra were analyzed to set\nstringent constraints on the formation cross section and on the hitherto\nbarely-known $\\eta'$-nucleus interaction.\n", "  Mir Abbas Jalali et al. [Phys. Rev. E 92, 032913(2015)] explained the\nretrograde turn of rings by aerodynamic phenomena due to the presence of a\ncentral hole in the ring as opposed to a disk. The results of our experiments\nsuggest that the drag torque is not the main reason for the retrograde turn of\nthe rings, and the results of theoretical research have shown that such a\nmotion is possible for both the ring and the disk in the case of rolling\nwithout slipping.\n", "  An exponential model of nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with the\ngravitational field is analyzed. It was shown that weak, dominant, and strong\nenergy conditions are satisfied. We obtain corrections to Coulomb's law at\n$r\\rightarrow\\infty$. It was demonstrated that electric-magnetic duality\nbetween ${\\cal F}$ and ${\\cal P}$ frames is violated. The asymptotic black hole\nsolution at $r\\rightarrow \\infty$ is found that contains corrections to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution. The electromagnetic mass of the black hole is\ncalculated, expressed through the parameter $\\beta$ of the model.\n", "  A precise solution of the general relativity equations for centrally\nsymmetric distribution of a pseudoscalar field with U(1) symmetry is presented.\nIt is found that energy density of the field is restricted in the symmetry\ncenter and falls with radial distance at a much slower rate than in numerical\nsimulations of dark matter haloes. This result can solve the cusp problem for\ngalaxies and the problem of rotation curves for galaxy exteriors.\n", "  A broad fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying the\nphenomenology of supercooled liquids has remained elusive, despite decades of\nintense exploration. When supercooled beneath its characteristic melting\ntemperature, a liquid sees a sharp rise in its viscosity over a narrow\ntemperature range, eventually becoming frozen on laboratory timescales.\nExplaining this immense increase in viscosity is one of the principle goals of\ncondensed matter physicists. To that end, numerous theoretical frameworks have\nbeen proposed which explain and reproduce the temperature dependence of the\nviscosity of supercooled liquids. Each of these frameworks appears only\napplicable to specific classes of glassformers and each possess a number of\nvariable parameters. Here we describe a classical framework for explaining the\ndynamical behavior of supercooled liquids based on statistical mechanical\nconsiderations, and possessing only a single variable parameter. This parameter\nvaries weakly from liquid to liquid. Furthermore, as predicted by this new\nclassical theory and its earlier quantum counterpart, we find with the aid of a\nsmall dimensionless constant that varies in size from $\\sim 0.05-0.12$, a\nuniversal (16 decade) collapse of the viscosity data as a function of\ntemperature. The collapse appears in all known types of glass forming\nsupercooled liquids (silicates, metallic alloys, organic systems, chalcogenide,\nsugars, and water).\n", "  We review ways in which observations of the changing periods of pulsating\nvariable stars can be used to detect and directly measure their evolution. We\nbriefly describe the two main techniques of analysis -- (O-C) analysis and\nwavelet analysis -- and results for pulsating variable star types which are\nreasonably periodic: type I and II Cepheids, RR Lyrae stars, beta Cephei stars,\nand Mira stars. We comment briefly on delta Scuti stars and pulsating white\ndwarfs. For some of these variable star types, observations agree approximately\nwith the predictions of evolutionary models, but there still exist significant\nareas of disagreement that challenge future models of stellar evolution. There\nmay be a need, for instance, to include processes such as rotation, mass loss,\nand magnetic fields. There may also be non-evolutionary processes which are\ncontributing to the period changes.\n", "  We present a first evaluation of the potential for spin crossover (SCO)\ncompounds to be considered as a new class of giant mechanocaloric effect\nmaterial. From literature data on the variation of the spin crossover\ntemperature with pressure, we estimate the maximum available adiabatic\ntemperature change for several compounds and the relatively low pressures that\nmay be required to observe these effects.\n", "  We study directed, weighted graphs $G=(V,E)$ and consider the (not\nnecessarily symmetric) averaging operator $$ (\\mathcal{L}u)(i) = -\\sum_{j\n\\sim_{} i}{p_{ij} (u(j) - u(i))},$$ where $p_{ij}$ are normalized edge weights.\nGiven a vertex $i \\in V$, we define the diffusion distance to a set $B \\subset\nV$ as the smallest number of steps $d_{B}(i) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ required for half\nof all random walks started in $i$ and moving randomly with respect to the\nweights $p_{ij}$ to visit $B$ within $d_{B}(i)$ steps. Our main result is that\nthe eigenfunctions interact nicely with this notion of distance. In particular,\nif $u$ satisfies $\\mathcal{L}u = \\lambda u$ on $V$ and $$ B = \\left\\{ i \\in V:\n- \\varepsilon \\leq u(i) \\leq \\varepsilon \\right\\} \\neq \\emptyset,$$ then, for\nall $i \\in V$, $$ d_{B}(i) \\log{\\left( \\frac{1}{|1-\\lambda|} \\right) } \\geq\n\\log{\\left( \\frac{ |u(i)| }{\\|u\\|_{L^{\\infty}}} \\right)} -\n\\log{\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\varepsilon\\right)}.$$ $d_B(i)$ is a remarkably good\napproximation of $|u|$ in the sense of having very high correlation. The result\nimplies that the classical one-dimensional spectral embedding preserves\nparticular aspects of geometry in the presence of clustered data. We also give\na continuous variant of the result which has a connection to the hot spots\nconjecture.\n", "  High electric conductivity ~100 MegaSiemens/m and Seebeck coefficient >200\nmkV/K of carbon nanotubes (CNT) make them attractive for a variety of\napplications. Unfortunately, a high thermal conductivity ~ 3000 W/(m*K) due to\nthe phonon transport limits their capability for transforming energy between\nthe heat and electricity. Here we show that increasing the charge carrier\nconcentrations not only leads to an increase of both electric conductivity and\nSeebeck coeffcient, but also causes a substantial suppression of the thermal\nconductivity due to intensifying the phonon-electron collisions. A strong\ntransduction effect corresponding to an effective electron temperature change\n~115 K was observed in a CNT device, where the local gate electrodes have\ncontrolled the charge doping in the opposite ends. Transduction between the\nheat and the energy of the electron subsystem corresponds to an impressive\nfigure of merit cold ZT ~ 6 and the transduced power density P ~ 80kW/cm2.\n", "  This chapter explores the notion of \"dimension\" of a set. Various power laws\nby which an Euclidean space can be characterized are used to define dimensions,\nwhich then explore different aspects of the set. Also discussed are the\ngeneralization to multifractals, and discrete and continuous scale invariance\nwith the emergence of complex dimensions. The idea of renormalization group\nflow equations can be introduced in this framework, to show how the power laws\ndetermined by dimensional analysis (engineering dimensions) get modified by\nextra anomalous dimensions. As an example of the RG flow equation, the scaling\nof conductance by disorder in the context of localization is used. A few\ntechnicalities, including the connection between entropy and fractal dimension,\ncan be found in the appendices.\n", "  The method of waveform cross correlation (WCC) allows remote monitoring of\nweak seismic activity induced by underground tests. This type of monitoring is\nconsidered as a principal task of on-site inspection under the Comprehensive\nnuclear-test-ban treaty. On September 11, 2016, a seismic event with body wave\nmagnitude 2.1 was found in automatic processing near the epicenter of the\nunderground explosion conducted by the DPRK on September 9, 2016. This event\noccurred approximately two days after the test. Using the WCC method, two array\nstations of the International Monitoring System (IMS), USRK and KSRS, detected\nPn-wave arrivals, which were associated with a unique event. Standard automatic\nprocessing at the International Data Centre (IDC) did not create an event\nhypothesis, but in the following interactive processing based on WCC\ndetections, an IDC analyst was able to create a two-station event . Location\nand other characteristics of this small seismic source indicate that it is\nlikely an aftershock of the preceding explosion. Building on the success of\nautomatic detection and phase association, we carried out an extended analysis,\nwhich included later phases and closest non-IMS stations. The final cross\ncorrelation solution uses four stations, including MDJ (China) and SEHB\n(Republic of Korea), with the epicenter approximately 2 km to north-west from\nthe epicenter of the Sept. 9 test. We also located the aftershock epicenter by\nstandard IDC program LocSAT using the arrival times obtained by cross\ncorrelation. The distance between the DPRK and LocSAT aftershock epicenters is\n25.5 km, i.e. by an order of magnitude larger than that obtained by the WCC\nrelative location method.\n", "  Whether the fate of our species can be forecast from its past has been the\ntopic of considerable controversy. One refutation of the so-called Doomsday\nArgument is based on the premise that we are more likely to exist in a universe\ncontaining a greater number of observers. Here we present a Bayesian\nreformulation of the Doomsday Argument which is immune to this effect. By\nmarginalising over the spatial configuration of observers, we find that any\npreference for a larger total number of observers has no impact on the inferred\nlocal number. Our results remain unchanged when we adopt either the\nSelf-Indexing Assumption (SIA) or the Self-Sampling Assumption (SSA).\nFurthermore the median value of our posterior distribution is found to be in\nagreement with the frequentist forecast. Humanity's prognosis for the coming\ncentury is well approximated by a global catastrophic risk of 0.2% per year.\n", "  We demonstrate that the use of on-shell methods involving calculation of the\ndiscontinuity across the t-channel cut associated with the exchange of a pair\nof massless particles can be used to evaluate loop contributions to the\nelectromagnetic and gravitational scattering of both massive and massless\nparticles. In the gravitational case the use of factorization permits a\nstraightforward and algebraic calculation of higher order scattering results,\nwhich were obtained previously by considerably more arduous Feynman diagram\ntechniques.\n", "  All the states of N qubits can be classified into N-1 entanglement classes\nfrom 2-entangled to N-entangled (fully entangled) states. Each class of\nentangled states is characterized by an entanglement index that depends on the\npartition of N. The larger the entanglement index of an state, the more\nentangled or the less separable is the state in the sense that a larger maximal\nviolation of Bell's inequality is attainable for this class of state.\n", "  We develop and exploit a source of two-photon four-dimensional entanglement\nto report the first two-particle all-versus-nothing test of local realism with\na linear optics setup, but without resorting to a non-contextuality ssumption.\nOur experimental results are in well agreement with quantum mechanics while in\nextreme contradiction with local realism. Potential applications of our\nexperiment are briefly discussed.\n"]}
