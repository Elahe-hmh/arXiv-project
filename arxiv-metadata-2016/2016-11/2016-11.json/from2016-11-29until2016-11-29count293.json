Raman scattering spectrum, including the nonresonant,\nmixed and resonant components, is determined for the charge-density-wave (CDW)\nphase of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model at half filling within dynamical\nmean-field theory. Its frequency dependence is investigated for different\nvalues of the energy of the incident photons. The spectra reflect the different\nstructures in the density of states and how they are modified by screening and\nresonance effects. The calculations are performed for the $B_{\\rm 1g}$, $B_{\\rm\n2g}$ and $A_{\\rm 1g}$ symmetries (which are typically examined in experiment).\nOur results for the resonance effects of the Raman spectra, found by tuning the\nenergy of the incident photons, give information about the many-body charge\ndynamics of the CDW-ordered phase.\n", "  The enormous stiffness and low density of graphene make it an ideal material\nfor nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) applications. We demonstrate fabrication and\nelectrical readout of monolayer graphene resonators, and test their response to\nchanges in mass and temperature. The devices show resonances in the MHz range.\nThe strong dependence of the resonant frequency on applied gate voltage can be\nfit to a membrane model, which yields the mass density and built-in strain.\nUpon removal and addition of mass, we observe changes in both the density and\nthe strain, indicating that adsorbates impart tension to the graphene. Upon\ncooling, the frequency increases; the shift rate can be used to measure the\nunusual negative thermal expansion coefficient of graphene. The quality factor\nincreases with decreasing temperature, reaching ~10,000 at 5 K. By establishing\nmany of the basic attributes of monolayer graphene resonators, these studies\nlay the groundwork for applications, including high-sensitivity mass detectors.\n", "  In a fractional Cauchy problem, the usual first order time derivative is\nreplaced by a fractional derivative. This problem was first considered by\n\\citet{nigmatullin}, and \\citet{zaslavsky} in $\\mathbb R^d$ for modeling some\nphysical phenomena.\n  The fractional derivative models time delays in a diffusion process. We will\ngive a survey of the recent results on the fractional Cauchy problem and its\ngeneralizations on bounded domains $D\\subset \\rd$ obtained in \\citet{m-n-v-aop,\nmnv-2}. We also study the solutions of fractional Cauchy problem where the\nfirst time derivative is replaced with an infinite sum of fractional\nderivatives. We point out a connection to eigenvalue problems for the\nfractional time operators considered. The solutions to the eigenvalue problems\nare expressed by Mittag-Leffler functions and its generalized versions. The\nstochastic solution of the eigenvalue problems for the fractional derivatives\nare given by inverse subordinators.\n", "  This paper develops strong solutions and stochastic solutions for the\ntempered fractional diffusion equation on bounded domains. First the eigenvalue\nproblem for tempered fractional derivatives is solved. Then a separation of\nvariables, and eigenfunction expansions in time and space, are used to write\nstrong solutions. Finally, stochastic solutions are written in terms of an\ninverse subordinator.\n", "  We describe a concise general scheme for constructing solutions of\nEinstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond gravity-matter system in bulk space-time\ninteracting self-consistently with one or more (widely separated)\ncodimension-one electrically charged lightlike branes. The lightlike brane\ndynamics is explicitly given by manifestly reparametrization invariant\nworld-volume actions. We present several explicit classes of solutions with\ndifferent physical interpretation as wormhole-like space-times with one, two or\nmore \"throats\", singularity-free black holes, brane worlds and space-times\nundergoing a sequence of spontaneous compactification-decompactification\ntransitions.\n", "  We report radio frequency (rf) electrical readout of graphene mechanical\nresonators. The mechanical motion is actuated and detected directly by using a\nvector network analyzer, employing a local gate to minimize parasitic\ncapacitance. A resist-free doubly clamped sample with resonant frequency ~ 34\nMHz, quality factor ~ 10000 at 77 K, and signal-to-background ratio of over 20\ndB is demonstrated. In addition to being over two orders of magnitude faster\nthan the electrical rf mixing method, this technique paves the way for use of\ngraphene in rf devices such as filters and oscillators.\n", "  In a continuous time random walk (CTRW), each random jump follows a random\nwaiting time. CTRW scaling limits are time-changed processes that model\nanomalous diffusion. The outer process describes particle jumps, and the\nnon-Markovian inner process (or time change) accounts for waiting times between\njumps. This paper studies fractal properties of the sample functions of a\ntime-changed process, and establishes some general results on the Hausdorff and\npacking dimensions of its range and graph. Then those results are applied to\nCTRW scaling limits.\n", "  We present some nonlinear partial differential equations in 2+1-dimensions\nderived from the KdV Equation and its symmetries. We show that all these\nequations have the same 3-soliton structures. The only difference in these\nsolutions are the dispersion relations. We also showed that they pass the\nPainlev\\'e test.\n", "  In this paper we show that some 3-dimensional isometry algebras, specifically\nthose of type I, II, III and V (according Bianchi's classification), can be\nobtained as expansions of the isometries in 2 dimensions. It is shown that in\ngeneral more than one semigroup will lead to the same result. It is impossible\nto obtain the algebras of type IV, VI-IX as an expansion from the isometry\nalgebras in 2 dimensions. This means that the first set of algebras has\nproperties that can be obtained from isometries in 2 dimensions while the\nsecond set has properties that are in some sense intrinsic in 3 dimensions. All\nthe results are checked with computer programs. This procedure can be\ngeneralized to higher dimensions, which could be useful for diverse physical\napplications.\n", "  Fractional derivatives can be used to model time delays in a diffusion\nprocess. When the order of the fractional derivative is distributed over the\nunit interval, it is useful for modeling a mixture of delay sources. In some\nspecial cases distributed order derivative can be used to model ultra-slow\ndiffusion. We extend the results of (Baeumer, B. and Meerschaert, M. M.\nStochastic solutions for fractional Cauchy problems. Fract. Calc. Appl. Anal. 4\n(2001), 481--500.) in the single order fractional derivative case to\ndistributed order fractional derivative case. In particular, we develop the\nstrong analytic solutions of distributed order fractional Cauchy problems.\n", "  By taking into account precursor films accompanying nanodroplets on\ntrapezoidal substrates we show that on a mesoscopic level of description one\ndoes not observe the phenomenon of liquid-gas-substrate contact line pinning at\nsubstrate edges. This phenomenon is present in a macroscopic description and\nleads to non-unique contact angles which can take values within a range\ndetermined by the so-called Gibbs' criterion. Upon increasing the volume of the\nnanodroplet the apparent contact angle evaluated within the mesoscopic approach\nchanges continuously between two limiting values fulfilling Gibbs' criterion\nwhile the contact line moves smoothly across the edge of the trapezoidal\nsubstrate. The spatial extent of the range of positions of the contact line,\ncorresponding to the variations of the contact angle between the values given\nby Gibbs' criterion, is of the order of ten fluid particle diameters.\n", "  We consider five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond system\nself-consistently coupled to a lightlike 3-brane, where the latter acts as\nmaterial, charge and variable cosmological constant source. We find\nwormhole-like solutions whose total space-time manifold consists of either (a)\ntwo \"universes\", which are identical copies of the exterior space-time region\n(beyond the horizon) of 5-dimensional Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black hole,\nor (b) a \"right\" \"universe\" comprising the exterior space-time region of\nReissner-Nordstroem-anti-de Sitter black hole and a \"left\" \"universe\" being the\nRindler \"wedge\" of 5-dimensional flat Minkowski space. The wormhole \"throat\"\nconnecting these \"universes\", which is located on their common horizons, is\nself-consistently occupied by the lightlike 3-brane as a direct result of its\ndynamics given by an explicit reparametrization-invariant world-volume\nLagrangian action. The intrinsic world-volume metric on the 3-brane turns out\nto be flat, which allows its interpretation as a lightlike braneworld.\n", "  The results of a detailed kinetic study of the main plasma chemical processes\nin non-equilibrium ethanol/argon plasma are presented. It is shown that at the\nbeginning of the discharge the molecular hydrogen is mainly generated in the\nreaction of ethanol H-abstraction. Later hydrogen is formed from active H,\nCH2OH and CH3CHOH and formaldehyde. Comparison with experimental data has shown\nthat the used kinetic mechanism predicts well the concentrations of main\nspecies at the reactor outlet.\n", "  Using combinatorial arguments, we determine an upper bound on achievable\nrates of stabilizer codes used over the quantum erasure channel. This allows us\nto recover the no-cloning bound on the capacity of the quantum erasure channel,\nR is below 1-2p, for stabilizer codes: we also derive an improved upper bound\nof the form : R is below 1-2p-D(p) with a function D(p) that stays positive for\n0 < p < 1/2 and for any family of stabilizer codes whose generators have\nweights bounded from above by a constant - low density stabilizer codes.\n  We obtain an application to percolation theory for a family of self-dual\ntilings of the hyperbolic plane. We associate a family of low density\nstabilizer codes with appropriate finite quotients of these tilings. We then\nrelate the probability of percolation to the probability of a decoding error\nfor these codes on the quantum erasure channel. The application of our upper\nbound on achievable rates of low density stabilizer codes gives rise to an\nupper bound on the critical probability for these tilings.\n", "  Traditional treatments of the first law of black hole thermodynamics do not\ninclude a discussion of pressure and volume. We give an overview of recent\ndevelopments proposing a definition of volume that can be used to extend the\nfirst law to include these appropriately. New results are also presenting\nrelating to the critical point and the associated second order phase transition\nfor a rotating black-hole in four-dimensional space-time which is\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter. In line with known results for a non-rotating\ncharged black-hole, this phase transition is shown to be of Van der Waals type\nwith mean field exponents.\n", "  We discuss in some detail the properties of gravity (including f(R)-gravity)\ncoupled to non-standard nonlinear gauge field system containing a square root\nof the usual Maxwell Lagrangian. The latter is known to produce in flat\nspacetime a QCD-like confinement. Inclusion of gravity triggers various\nphysically interesting effects: new mechanism for dynamical generation of\ncosmological constant; non-standard black hole solutions with constant vacuum\nelectric field and with \"hedge-hog\"-type spacetime asymptotics, which are shown\nto obey the first law of black hole thermodynamics; new \"tubelike\" solutions of\nLevi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson type; charge-\"hiding\" and charge-confining\n\"thin-shell\" wormhole solutions; dynamical effective gauge couplings and\nconfinement-deconfinement transition effect when coupled to quadratic\nR^2-gravity.\n", "  The methods of mode decomposition and Fourier analysis of classical and\nquantum fields on curved spacetimes previously available mainly for the scalar\nfield on Friedman- Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetimes are extended to arbitrary\nvector bundle fields on general spatially homogeneous spacetimes. This is done\nby developing a rigorous unified framework which incorporates mode\ndecomposition, harmonic analysis and Fourier anal- ysis. The limits of\napplicability and uniqueness of mode decomposition by separation of the time\nvariable in the field equation are found. It is shown how mode decomposition\ncan be naturally extended to weak solutions of the field equation under some\nanalytical assumptions. It is further shown that these assumptions can always\nbe fulfilled if the vector bundle under consideration is analytic. The\npropagator of the field equation is explicitly mode decomposed. A short survey\non the geometry of the models considered in mathematical cosmology is given and\nit is concluded that practically all of them can be represented by a semidirect\nhomogeneous vector bundle. Abstract harmonic analytical Fourier transform is\nintroduced in semidirect homogeneous spaces and it is explained how it can be\nrelated to the spectral Fourier transform. The general form of invariant\nbi-distributions on semidirect homogeneous spaces is found in the Fourier space\nwhich generalizes earlier results for the homogeneous states of the scalar\nfield on FRW spacetimes.\n", "  The family of hyperbolic surface codes is one of the rare families of quantum\nLDPC codes with non-zero rate and unbounded minimum distance. First, we\nintroduce a family of hyperbolic color codes. This produces a new family of\nquantum LDPC codes with non-zero rate and with minimum distance logarithmic in\nthe blocklength. Second, we study the tradeoff between the length n, the number\nof encoded qubits k and the distance d of surface codes and color codes. We\nprove that kd^2 is upper bounded by C(log k)^2n, where C is a constant that\ndepends only on the row weight of the parity-check matrix. Our results prove\nthat the best asymptotic minimum distance of LDPC surface codes and color codes\nwith non-zero rate is logarithmic in the length.\n", "  The morphological phase transition between a sessile and lenticular shapes of\na droplet placed in a nanochannel is observed upon increasing the droplet\nvolume. The phase diagram for this system is discussed within the macro- and\nmesoscopic approaches. On the mesoscopic level, the van der Waals forces are\ntaken into account via the effective interface potential acting between the\nchannel walls and the droplet. We discuss the contact angle dependence on the\ndroplet volume and the distance between the walls; this angle turns out to be\nsmaller than the macroscopic Young's angle. The droplet presence induces the\nsolvation force acting between the channel walls. It can be both attractive and\nrepulsive, depending on the width of the channel.\n", "  Nambu-Goto action in classical bosonic string model for hadrons predicts\nquark-antiquark potential to be\\cite{Nambu-Goto} $V(r)=-\\frac{\\gamma}{r}+\\sigma\nr +\\mu_0$. In this report we present studies of masses of heavy flavour mesons\nin higher dimension with our recently developed wave functions obtained\nfollowing string inspired potential. We report the dimensional dependence of\nthe masses of mesons. Our results suggest that as the meson mass increases with\nthe number of extra spatial dimension, it will attain the Planck scale ($ \\sim\n10^{19}GeV$) asymptotically at an astronomically large spatial dimension (we\ncall it Planck dimension) $D_{Planck} \\sim 10^{11}$, which sets the limit of\napplicability of Schrodinger equation in large dimension.\n", "  The development of graphene electronics requires the integration of graphene\ndevices with Si-CMOS technology. Most strategies involve the transfer of\ngraphene sheets onto silicon, with the inherent difficulties of clean transfer\nand subsequent graphene nano-patterning that degrades considerably the\nelectronic mobility of nanopatterned graphene. Epitaxial graphene (EG) by\ncontrast is grown on an essentially perfect crystalline (semi-insulating)\nsurface, and graphene nanostructures with exceptional properties have been\nrealized by a selective growth process on tailored SiC surface that requires no\ngraphene patterning. However, the temperatures required in this structured\ngrowth process are too high for silicon technology. Here we demonstrate a new\ngraphene to Si integration strategy, with a bonded and interconnected compact\ndouble-wafer structure. Using silicon-on-insulator technology (SOI) a thin\nmonocrystalline silicon layer ready for CMOS processing is applied on top of\nepitaxial graphene on SiC. The parallel Si and graphene platforms are\ninterconnected by metal vias. This method inspired by the industrial\ndevelopment of 3d hyper-integration stacking thin-film electronic devices\npreserves the advantages of epitaxial graphene and enables the full spectrum of\nCMOS processing.\n", "  We give a detailed study of the traveling wave solutions of $(\\ell=2)$\nKaup-Boussinesq type of coupled KdV equations. Depending upon the zeros of a\nfourth degree polynomial, we have cases where there exist no nontrivial real\nsolutions, cases where asymptotically decaying to a constant solitary wave\nsolutions, and cases where there are periodic solutions. All such possible\nsolutions are given explicitly in the form of Jacobi elliptic functions. Graphs\nof some exact solutions in solitary wave and periodic shapes are exhibited.\nExtension of our study to the cases $\\ell=3$ and $\\ell=4$ are also mentioned.\n", "  We prove trace estimates for the relativistic $\\alpha$-stable process\nextending the result of Ba\\~{n}uelos and Kulczycki (2008) in the stable case.\n", "  We propose a simple decoding algorithm for CSS codes taking into account the\ncorrelations between the X part and the Z part of the error. Applying this idea\nto surface codes, we derive an improved version of the perfect matching\ndecoding algorithm which uses these X/Z correlations.\n", "  In this paper an analysis of the geometrical construction of the AdS/CFT\nCorrespondence is made. A geometrical definition of the configuration manifold\nand the boundary manifold in terms of the conformal compactification scheme is\ngiven. As a conclusion, it was obtained that the usual definition of the\ncorrespondence is strongly dependent of the unicity of the conformal class of\nmetrics on the boundary. Finally, a summary of some of the geometrical issues\nof the correspondence is made, along with a possible way to avoid them.\n", "  Structured growth of high quality graphene is necessary for technological\ndevelopment of carbon based electronics. Specifically, control of the bunching\nand placement of surface steps under epitaxial graphene on SiC is an important\nconsideration for graphene device production. We demonstrate lithographically\npatterned evaporated amorphous carbon corrals as a method to pin SiC surface\nsteps. Evaporated amorphous carbon is an ideal step-flow barrier on SiC due to\nits chemical compatibility with graphene growth and its structural stability at\nhigh temperatures, as well as its patternability. The amorphous carbon is\ndeposited in vacuum on SiC prior to graphene growth. In the graphene furnace at\ntemperatures above 1200$^\\circ$C, mobile SiC steps accumulate at these\namorphous carbon barriers, forming an aligned step free region for graphene\ngrowth at temperatures above 1330$^\\circ$C. AFM imaging and Raman spectroscopy\nsupport the formation of quality step-free graphene sheets grown on SiC with\nthe step morphology aligned to the carbon grid.\n", "  The detection of B-modes in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\npolarization by the BICEP2 experiment, if interpreted as evidence for a\nprimordial gravitational wave background, has enormous ramifications for\ncosmology and physics. It is crucial to test this hypothesis with independent\nmeasurements. A gravitational wave background leads to B-modes in galaxy shape\ncorrelations (shear) both through lensing and tidal alignment effects. Since\nthe systematics and foregrounds of galaxy shapes and CMB polarization are\nentirely different, a detection of a cross-correlation between the two\nobservables would provide conclusive proof for the existence of a primordial\ngravitational wave background. We find that upcoming weak lensing surveys will\nbe able to detect the cross-correlation between B-modes of the CMB and galaxy\nshapes. However, this detection is not sufficient to confirm or falsify the\nhypothesis of a primordial origin for CMB B-mode polarization.\n", "  Entanglement entropy has proven to be an extremely useful concept in quantum\nfield theory. Gauge theories are of particular interest, but for these systems\nthe entanglement entropy is not clearly defined because the physical Hilbert\nspace does not factor as a tensor product according to regions of space. Here\nwe review a definition of entanglement entropy that applies to abelian and\nnonabelian lattice gauge theories. This entanglement entropy is obtained by\nembedding the physical Hilbert space into a product of Hilbert spaces\nassociated to regions with boundary. The latter Hilbert spaces include degrees\nof freedom on the entangling surface that transform like surface charges under\nthe gauge symmetry. These degrees of freedom are shown to contribute to the\nentanglement entropy, and the form of this contribution is determined by the\ngauge symmetry. We test our definition using the example of two-dimensional\nYang-Mills theory, and find that it agrees with the thermal entropy in de\nSitter space, and with the results of the Euclidean replica trick. We discuss\nthe possible implications of this result for more complicated gauge theories,\nincluding quantum gravity.\n", "  Intrinsic alignments of galaxies have been shown to contaminate weak\ngravitational lensing observables on linear scales, $r>$ 10 $h^{-1}$Mpc, but\nstudies of alignments in the non-linear regime have thus far been inconclusive.\nWe present an estimator for extracting the intrinsic alignment signal of\ngalaxies around stacked clusters of galaxies from multiband imaging data. Our\nestimator removes the contamination caused by galaxies that are gravitationally\nlensed by the clusters and scattered in redshift space due to photometric\nredshift uncertainties. It uses posterior probability distributions for the\nredshifts of the galaxies in the sample and it is easily extended to obtain the\nweak gravitational lensing signal while removing the intrinsic alignment\ncontamination. We apply this algorithm to groups and clusters of galaxies\nidentified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey `Stripe 82' coadded imaging data\nover $\\sim 150$ deg$^2$. We find that the intrinsic alignment signal around\nstacked clusters in the redshift range $0.1<z<0.4$ is consistent with zero. In\nterms of the tidal alignment model of Catelan et al. (2001), we set joint\nconstraints on the strength of the alignment and the bias of the lensing groups\nand clusters on scales between 0.1 and $10\\,h^{-1}$ Mpc, $b_LC_1\\rho_{\\rm crit}\n= -2_{-14}^{+14} \\times 10^{-4}$. This constrains the contamination fraction of\nalignment to lensing signal to the range between $[-18,23]$ per cent below\nscales of 1 $h^{-1}$ Mpc at 95 per cent confidence level, and this result\ndepends on our photometric redshift quality and selection criteria used to\nidentify background galaxies. Our results are robust to the choice of\nphotometric band in which the shapes are measured ($i$ and $r$) and to centring\non the Brightest Cluster Galaxy or on the geometrical centre of the clusters.\n", "  We introduce a new method for deriving the time-dependent Hartree or\nHartree-Fock equations as an effective mean-field dynamics from the microscopic\nSchroedinger equation for fermionic many-particle systems in quantum mechanics.\nThe method is an adaption of the method used in [Pickl, Lett. Math. Phys.,\n97(2):151-164, 2011] for bosonic systems to fermionic systems. It is based on a\nGronwall type estimate for a suitable measure of distance between the\nmicroscopic solution and an antisymmetrized product state. We use this method\nto treat a new mean-field limit for fermions with long-range interactions in a\nlarge volume. Some of our results hold for singular attractive or repulsive\ninteractions. We can also treat Coulomb interaction assuming either a mild\nsingularity cutoff or certain regularity conditions on the solutions to the\nHartree(-Fock) equations. In the considered limit, the kinetic and interaction\nenergy are of the same order, while the average force is subleading. For some\ninteractions, we prove that the Hartree(-Fock) dynamics is a more accurate\napproximation than a simpler dynamics that one would expect from the subleading\nforce. With our method we also treat the mean-field limit coupled to a\nsemiclassical limit, which was discussed in the literature before, and we\nrecover some of the previous results. All results hold for initial data close\n(but not necessarily equal) to antisymmetrized product states and we always\nprovide explicit rates of convergence.\n", "  We consider non-linear time-fractional stochastic heat type equation\n$$\\partial^\\beta_tu_t(x)=-\\nu(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}\nu_t(x)+I^{1-\\beta}_t[\\sigma(u)\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)]$$ in $(d+1)$\ndimensions, where $\\nu>0, \\beta\\in (0,1)$, $\\alpha\\in (0,2]$ and\n$d<\\min\\{2,\\beta^{-1}\\}\\a$, $\\partial^\\beta_t$ is the Caputo fractional\nderivative, $-(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an isotropic stable\nprocess, $I^{1-\\beta}_t$ is the fractional integral operator,\n$\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)$ is space-time white noise, and\n$\\sigma:\\RR{R}\\to\\RR{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous.\n  Time fractional stochastic heat type equations might be used to model\nphenomenon with random effects with thermal memory. We prove existence and\nuniqueness of mild solutions to this equation and establish conditions under\nwhich the solution is continuous. Our results extend the results in the case of\nparabolic stochastic partial differential equations obtained in\n\\cite{foondun-khoshnevisan-09, walsh}. In sharp contrast to the stochastic\npartial differential equations studied earlier in\n\\cite{foondun-khoshnevisan-09, khoshnevisan-cbms, walsh}, in some cases our\nresults give existence of random field solutions in spatial dimensions\n$d=1,2,3$. Under faster than linear growth of $\\sigma$, we show that time\nfractional stochastic partial differential equation has no finite energy\nsolution. This extends the result of Foondun and Parshad \\cite{foondun-parshad}\nin the case of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations. We also\nestablish a connection of the time fractional stochastic partial differential\nequations to higher order parabolic stochastic differential equations.\n", "  We consider time fractional stochastic heat type equation\n$$\\partial^\\beta_tu(t,x)=-\\nu(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2}\nu_t(x)+I^{1-\\beta}_t[\\sigma(u)\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)]$$ in $(d+1)$\ndimensions, where $\\nu>0$, $\\beta\\in (0,1)$, $\\alpha\\in (0,2]$,\n$d<\\min\\{2,\\beta^{-1}\\}\\a$, $\\partial^\\beta_t$ is the Caputo fractional\nderivative, $-(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an isotropic stable\nprocess, $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{W}(t,x)$ is space-time white noise, and\n$\\sigma:\\RR{R}\\to\\RR{R}$ is Lipschitz continuous.\n  The time fractional stochastic heat type equations might be used to model\nphenomenon with random effects with thermal memory. We prove: (i) absolute\nmoments of the solutions of this equation grows exponentially; and (ii) the\ndistances to the origin of the farthest high peaks of those moments grow\nexactly linearly with time. These results extend the results of Foondun and\nKhoshnevisan \\cite{foondun-khoshnevisan-09}\n  %(Mohammud Foondun and Davar Khoshnevisan, Intermittence and nonlinear\nparabolic %stochastic partial differential equations, Electron.

In this paper, we move\nbeyond using $k$-core decomposition as a tool to summarize a graph and propose\nusing $k$-core decomposition as a tool to model random graphs. We propose using\nthe shell distribution vector, a way of summarizing the decomposition, as a\nsufficient statistic for a family of exponential random graph models. We study\nthe properties and behavior of the model family, implement a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm for simulating graphs from the model, implement a direct\nsampler from the set of graphs with a given shell distribution, and explore the\nsampling distributions of some of the commonly used complementary statistics as\ngood candidates for heuristic model fitting. These algorithms provide first\nfundamental steps necessary for solving the following problems: parameter\nestimation in this ERGM, extending the model to its Bayesian relative, and\ndeveloping a rigorous methodology for testing goodness of fit of the model and\nmodel selection. The methods are applied to a synthetic network as well as the\nwell-known Sampson monks dataset.\n", "  We study the motion of an elastic capsule through a microchannel\ncharacterized by a localized constriction. We consider a capsule with a\nstress-free spherical shape and impose its steady state configuration in an\ninfinitely long straight channel as the initial condition for our calculations.\nWe report how the capsule deformation, velocity, retention time, and maximum\nstress of the membrane are affected by the capillary number, Ca, and the\nconstriction shape. We estimate the deformation by measuring the variation of\nthe three-dimensional surface area and a series of alternative quantities\neasier to extract from experiments. These are the Taylor parameter, the\nperimeter and the area of the capsule in the spanwise plane. We find that the\nperimeter is the quantity that reproduces the behavior of the three-dimensional\nsurface area the best. We observe that, in general, area-deformation correlated\nquantities grow linearly with Ca, while velocity-correlated quantities saturate\nfor large Ca but display a steeper increase for small Ca. The velocity of the\ncapsule divided by the velocity of the flow displays, surprisingly, two\ndifferent qualitative behaviors for small and large capillary numbers. Finally,\nwe report that longer constrictions and spanwise wall bounded (versus spanwise\nperiodic) domains cause larger deformations and velocities. If the deformation\nand velocity in the spanwise wall bounded domains are rescaled by the initial\nequilibrium deformation and velocity, their behavior is undistinguishable from\nthat in a periodic domain. In contrast, a remarkably different behavior is\nreported in sinusoidally shaped and smoothed rectangular constrictions\nindicating that the capsule dynamics is particularly sensitive to abrupt\nchanges in the cross section. In a smoothed rectangular constriction larger\ndeformations and velocities occur over a larger distance.\n", "  Kinetics of steady-state copolymerization has been investigated since 1940s.\nIrreversible terminal and penultimate models were successfully applied to a\nnumber of comonomer systems, but failed for systems where depropagation is\nsignificant. Although a general mathematical treatment of the terminal model\nwith depropagation was established in 1980s, penultimate model and higher-order\nterminal models with depropagation have not been systematically studied, since\ndepropagation leads to hierarchically-coupled and unclosed kinetic equations\nwhich are hard to be solved analytically. In this work, we propose a truncation\nmethod to solve the steady-state kinetic equations of any-order terminal models\nwith depropagation in an unified way, by reducing them into closed steady-state\nequations which give the exact solution of the original kinetic equations.\nBased on the steady-state equations, we also derive a general thermodynamic\nequality in which the Shannon entropy of the copolymer sequence is explicitly\nintroduced as part of the free energy dissipation of the whole copolymerization\nsystem.\n", "  In usual measurement with the Senarmont method using a conventional\npolarization microscope, the azimuth angle of the analyzer at extinction of the\nemerging light is detected by naked eyes. If the intensity of light is measured\nas a function of the azimuth angle of the analyzer, one can find the direction\nat which the intensity is minimized more accurately by fitting. However, this\nprocedure requires much numbers of operations as compared to the usual method,\nand thus is time-consuming. To circumvent this problem a setting with which the\nintensity is measured as a function of the azimuth angle of the analyzer is\nconstructed with rotation of the analyzer through a computer control. As a\nresult, the time required for the measurement has been greatly decreased.\n", "  We consider $d$-fold branched coverings of the projective plane\n$\\mathbb{RP}^2$ and show that the hypergeometric tau function of the BKP\nhierarchy of Kac and van de Leur is the generating function for weighted sums\nof the related Hurwitz numbers. In particular we get the $\\mathbb{RP}^2$\nanalogues of the $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ generating functions proposed by Okounkov and\nby Goulden and Jackson. Other examples are Hurwitz numbers weighted by the\nHall-Littlewood and by the Macdonald polynomials. We also consider integrals of\ntau functions which generate projective Hurwitz numbers and Hurwitz numbers\nrelated to different Euler characteristics of the base Klein surfaces.\n", "  Many fractional quantum Hall wave functions are known to be unique and\nhighest-density zero modes of certain \"pseudopotential\" Hamiltonians. Examples\ninclude the Read-Rezayi series (in particular, the Laughlin, Moore-Read and\nRead-Rezayi Z_3 states), and more exotic non-unitary (Haldane-Rezayi, Gaffnian\nstates) or irrational states (Haffnian state). While a systematic method to\nconstruct such Hamiltonians is available for the infinite plane or sphere\ngeometry, its generalization to manifolds such as the cylinder or torus, where\nrelative angular momentum is not an exact quantum number, has remained an open\nproblem. Here we develop a geometric approach for constructing pseudopotential\nHamiltonians in a universal manner that naturally applies to all geometries.\nOur method generalizes to the multicomponent SU(n) cases with a combination of\nspin or pseudospin (layer, subband, valley) degrees of freedom. We demonstrate\nthe utility of the approach through several examples, including certain\nnon-Abelian multicomponent states whose parent Hamiltonians were previously\nunknown, and verify the method by numerically computing their entanglement\nproperties.\n", "  We investigate site percolation on a weighted planar stochastic lattice\n(WPSL) which is a multifractal and whose dual is a scale-free network.\nPercolation is typically characterized by percolation threshold $p_c$ and by a\nset of critical exponents $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $\\nu$ which describe the critical\nbehavior of percolation probability $P(p)\\sim (p_c-p)^\\beta$, mean cluster size\n$S\\sim (p_c-p)^{-\\gamma}$ and the correlation length $\\xi\\sim (p_c-p)^{-\\nu}$.\nBesides, the exponent $\\tau$ characterizes the cluster size distribution\nfunction $n_s(p_c)\\sim s^{-\\tau}$ and the fractal dimension $d_f$ the spanning\ncluster. We obtain an exact value for $p_c$ and for all these exponents. Our\nresults suggest that the percolation on WPSL belong to a new universality class\nas its exponents do not share the same value as for all the existing planar\nlattices.\n", "  We consider the possibility that the universe is made of a single dark fluid\ndescribed by a logotropic equation of state $P=A\\ln(\\rho/\\rho_*)$, where $\\rho$\nis the rest-mass density, $\\rho_*$ is a reference density, and $A$ is the\nlogotropic temperature. The energy density $\\epsilon$ is the sum of two terms:\na rest-mass energy term $\\rho c^2$ that mimics dark matter and an internal\nenergy term $u(\\rho)=-P(\\rho)-A$ that mimics dark energy. This decomposition\nleads to a natural, and physical, unification of dark matter and dark energy,\nand elucidates their mysterious nature. The logotropic model depends on a\nsingle parameter $B=A/\\rho_{\\Lambda}c^2$ where $\\rho_{\\Lambda}$ is the\ncosmological density. For $B=0$, we recover the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Using\ncosmological constraints, we find that $0\\le B\\le 0.09425$. We consider the\npossibility that dark matter halos are described by the same logotropic\nequation of state. When $B>0$, pressure gradients prevent gravitational\ncollapse and provide halo density cores instead of cuspy density profiles, in\nagreement with the observations. The universal rotation curve of logotropic\ndark matter halos is consistent with the observational Burkert profile up to\nthe halo radius. Interestingly, if we assume that all the dark matter halos\nhave the same logotropic temperature $B$, we find that their surface density\n$\\Sigma=\\rho_0 r_h$ is constant. This result is in agreement with the\nobservations where it is found that $\\Sigma_0=141\\, M_{\\odot}/{\\rm pc}^2$ for\ndark matter halos differing by several orders of magnitude in size. Using this\nobservational result, we obtain $B=3.53\\times 10^{-3}$. Assuming that\n$\\rho_*=\\rho_P$, where $\\rho_P$ is the Planck density, we predict $B=3.53\\times\n10^{-3}$, in perfect agreement with the value obtained from the observations.\n", "  Employing alternative spacetime volume-forms (generally-covariant integration\nmeasure densities) independent of the pertinent Riemannian spacetime metric\nhave profound impact in general relativity. Although formally appearing as\n\"pure-gauge\" dynamical degrees of freedom they trigger a number of remarkable\nphysically important phenomena such as: (i) new mechanism of dynamical\ngeneration of cosmological constant; (ii) new type of \"quintessential\ninflation\" scenario in cosmology; (iii) non-singular initial \"emergent\nuniverse\" phase of cosmological evolution preceding the inflationary phase;\n(iv) new mechanism of dynamical spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry in\nsupergravity; (v) gravitational electrovacuum \"bags\". We study in some detail\nthe properties, together with their canonical Hamiltonian formulation, of a\nclass of generalized gravity-matter models built with two independent\nnon-Riemannian volume-forms and discuss their implications in cosmology.\n", "  Unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) has been reported in WTe2, and remains\nirrepressible up to very high field. Intense optimization of the crystalline\nquality causes a squarely-increasing MR, as interpreted by perfect compensation\nof opposite carriers. Herein we report our observation of linear MR (LMR) in\nWTe2 crystals, the onset of which is first identified by constructing the\nmobility spectra of the MR at low fields. The LMR further intensifies and\npredominates at fields higher than 20 Tesla while the parabolic MR gradually\ndecays. The LMR remains unsaturated up to a high field of 60 Tesla and\npersists, even at a high pressure of 6.2 GPa. Assisted by density functional\ntheory calculations and detailed mobility spectra, we find the LMR to be robust\nagainst the applications of high field, broken carrier balance, and mobility\nsuppression. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals a unique\nquasilinear energy dispersion near the Fermi level. Our results suggest that\nthe robust LMR is the low bound of the unsaturated MR in WTe2.\n", "  We study magneto-transport properties of several amorphous Indium oxide\nnanowires of different widths. The wires show superconducting transition at\nzero magnetic field, but, there exist a finite resistance at the lowest\ntemperature. The $R(T)$ broadening was explained by available phase slip\nmodels. At low field, and far below the superconducting critical temperature,\nthe wires with diameter equal to or less than 100 nm, show negative\nmagnetoresistance (nMR). The magnitude of nMR and the crossover field are found\nto be dependent on both temperature and the cross-sectional area. We find that\nthis intriguing behavior originates from the interplay between two field\ndependent contributions.\n", "  The time it takes to accelerate an object from zero to a given velocity\ndepends on the applied force and the environment. If the force ceases, it takes\nexactly the same time to completely decelerate. A magnetic domain wall (DW) is\na topological object that has been observed to follow this behavior. Here we\nshow that acceleration and deceleration times of chiral Neel walls driven by\ncurrent are different in a system with low damping and moderate\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange constant. The time needed to accelerate a\nDW with current via the spin Hall torque is much faster than the time it needs\nto decelerate once the current is turned off. The deceleration time is defined\nby the DM exchange constant whereas the acceleration time depends on the spin\nHall torque, enabling tunable inertia of chiral DWs. Such unique feature of\nchiral DWs can be utilized to move and position DWs with lower current, key to\nthe development of storage class memory devices.\n", "  Let $\\Delta$ be a rank 2 hyperbolic root system. Then $\\Delta$ has\ngeneralized Cartan matrix $H(a,b)= \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} ~2 & -b\\\\ -a & ~2\n\\end{smallmatrix}\\right)$ indexed by $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ with $ab\\geq 5$. If\n$a\\neq b$, then $\\Delta$ is non-symmetric and is generated by one long simple\nroot and one short simple root; whereas if $a= b$, $\\Delta$ is symmetric and is\ngenerated by two long simple roots. We prove that if $a\\neq b$, then $\\Delta$\ncontains an infinite family of symmetric rank 2 hyperbolic root subsystems\n$H(k,k)$ for certain $k\\geq 3$, generated by either two short or two long\nsimple roots. We also prove that $\\Delta$ contains non-symmetric rank 2\nhyperbolic root subsystems $H(a',b')$, for certain $a',b'\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ with\n$a'b'\\geq 5$. One of our tools is a characterization of the types of root\nsubsystems that are generated by a subset of roots. We classify these types of\nsubsystems in rank 2 hyperbolic root systems.\n", "  We consider the stationary incompressible Navier-Stokes equation in the\nhalf-plane with inhomogeneous boundary condition. We prove existence of strong\nsolutions for boundary data close to any Jeffery-Hamel solution with small flux\nevaluated on the boundary. The perturbation of the Jeffery-Hamel solution on\nthe boundary has to satisfy a nonlinear compatibility condition which\ncorresponds to the integral of the velocity field on the boundary. The first\ncomponent of this integral is the flux which is an invariant quantity, but the\nsecond, called the asymmetry, is not invariant, which leads to one\ncompatibility condition. Finally, we prove existence of weak solutions, as well\nas weak-strong uniqueness for small data.\n", "  We calculate the vacuum entanglement entropy of Maxwell theory in a class of\ncurved spacetimes by Kaluza-Klein reduction of the theory onto a\ntwo-dimensional base manifold. Using two-dimensional duality, we express the\ngeometric entropy of the electromagnetic field as the entropy of a tower of\nscalar fields, constant electric and magnetic fluxes, and a contact term, whose\nleading order divergence was discovered by Kabat. The complete contact term\ntakes the form of one negative scalar degree of freedom confined to the\nentangling surface. We show that the geometric entropy agrees with a\nstatistical definition of entanglement entropy that includes edge modes:\nclassical solutions determined by their boundary values on the entangling\nsurface. This resolves a longstanding puzzle about the statistical\ninterpretation of the contact term in the entanglement entropy. We discuss the\nimplications of this negative term for black hole thermodynamics and the\nrenormalization of Newton's constant.\n", "  In a previous paper [A. Mori, T. Kaito, H. Furukawa, Mater. Lett. 62 (2008)\n3459-3461], we carried out birefringence measurements of Pb(II)-doped silica\nhydrogels prepared in a magnetic field (B). For a 5T sample, we observed a\nnegative birefringence with the optic axis along B. At that time, providing a\npositive intrinsic birefringence of silica, we speculated that in the\nbirefringent gels the gel network extended perpendicular to B. The purpose of\nthis paper is to reconsider this speculation on the basis of previous and\nrecent results [T. Kaito, S.-i. Yanagiya, A. Mori, M. Kurumada, C. Kaito, T.\nInoue, J. Cryst. Growth 289 (2006) 275-277; T. Kaito, A. Mori, C. Kaito, J.\nChem. Chem. Eng., 9 (2015) 61-66]. In the former, the silica gels were used as\na medium of a crystal growth of PbBr2 and aligned arrays of crystallites with\nlong axis parallel to B were obtained. In the latter, Pb(II) nanocrystallites\nwere formed in silica xerogels by electron irradiation. Both of the short axis\nof PbBr2 crystallites and the diameter of Pb(II) crystallites were a few tens\nof nanometers. This size must be a size of short axis of pores in the gel\nnetworks elongated affected by the magnetic field. Since the PbBr2 crystallites\nwere elongated along the magnetic field, we conclude that the Pb(II)-doped\nsilica gel networks aligned along the magnetic field.\n", "  We investigate the completeness of Gabor systems with respect to several\nclasses of window functions on rational lattices. Our main results show that\nthe time-frequency shifts of every finite linear combination of Hermite\nfunctions with respect to a rational lattice are complete in L2(R), thus\ngeneralizing a remark of von Neumann (and proved by Bargmann, Perelomov et\nal.). An analogous result is proven for functions that factor into certain\nrational functions and the Gaussian. The results are also interesting from a\nconceptual point of view since they show a vast difference between the\ncompleteness and the frame property of a Gabor system. In the terminology of\nphysics we prove new results about the completeness of coherent state\nsubsystems.\n", "  Galaxy shapes are subject to distortions due to the tidal field of the\nUniverse. The cross-correlation of galaxy lensing with the lensing of the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) cannot easily be separated from the\ncross-correlation of galaxy intrinsic shapes with CMB lensing. Previous work\nsuggested that the intrinsic alignment contamination can be $15\\%$ of this\ncross-spectrum for the CFHT Stripe 82 (CS82) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope\nsurveys. Here we re-examine these estimates using up-to-date observational\nconstraints of intrinsic alignments at a redshift more similar to that of CS82\ngalaxies. We find a $\\approx$ $10\\%$ contamination of the cross-spectrum from\nred galaxies, with $\\approx$ $3\\%$ uncertainty due to uncertainties in the\nredshift distribution of source galaxies and the modelling of the spectral\nenergy distribution. Blue galaxies are consistent with being unaligned, but\ncould contaminate the cross-spectrum by an additional $9.5\\%$ within current\n$95\\%$ confidence levels. While our fiducial estimate of alignment\ncontamination is similar to previous work, our work suggests that the relevance\nof alignments for CMB lensing-galaxy lensing cross-correlation remains largely\nunconstrained. Little information is currently available about alignments at\n$z>1.2$. We consider the upper limiting case where all $z>1.2$ galaxies are\naligned with the same strength as low redshift luminous red galaxies, finding\nas much as $\\approx$ $60\\%$ contamination.\n", "  The intrinsic alignments of galaxies are recognised as a contaminant to weak\ngravitational lensing measurements. In this work, we study the alignment of\ngalaxy shapes and spins at low redshift ($z\\sim 0.5$) in Horizon-AGN, an\nadaptive-mesh-refinement hydrodynamical cosmological simulation box of 100\nMpc/h a side with AGN feedback implementation. We find that spheroidal galaxies\nin the simulation show a tendency to be aligned radially towards over-densities\nin the dark matter density field and other spheroidals. This trend is in\nagreement with observations, but the amplitude of the signal depends strongly\non how shapes are measured and how galaxies are selected in the simulation.\nDisc galaxies show a tendency to be oriented tangentially around spheroidals in\nthree-dimensions. While this signal seems suppressed in projection, this does\nnot guarantee that disc alignments can be safely ignored in future weak lensing\nsurveys. The shape alignments of luminous galaxies in Horizon-AGN are in\nagreement with observations and other simulation works, but we find less\nalignment for lower luminosity populations. We also characterize the\nsystematics of galaxy shapes in the simulation and show that they can be safely\nneglected when measuring the correlation of the density field and galaxy\nellipticities.\n", "  Based on an earlier introduced new class of generalized gravity-matter models\ndefined in terms of two independent non-Riemannian volume forms (alternative\ngenerally covariant integration measure densities) on the space-time manifold,\nwe derive an effective \"Einstein-frame\" theory featuring the following\nremarkable properties: (i) We obtain effective potential for the cosmological\nscalar field possessing two infinitely large flat regions which allows for a\nunified description of both early universe inflation as well as of present dark\nenergy epoch; (ii) For a specific parameter range the model possesses a\nnon-singular stable \"emergent universe\" solution which describes an initial\nphase of evolution that precedes the inflationary phase.\n", "  We show that dark energy and dark matter can be described simultaneously by\nordinary Einstein gravity interacting with a single scalar field provided the\nscalar field Lagrangian couples in a symmetric fashion to two different\nspacetime volume-forms (covariant integration measure densities) on the\nspacetime manifold - one standard Riemannian given by the square-root of the\ndeterminant of the pertinent Riemannian metric and another non-Riemannian\nvolume-form independent of the Riemannian metric, defined in terms of an\nauxiliary antisymmetric tensor gauge field of maximal rank. Integration of the\nequations of motion of the latter auxiliary gauge field produce an a priori\narbitrary integration constant that plays the role of a dynamically generated\ncosmological constant or dark energy. Moreover, the above modified scalar field\naction turns out to possess a hidden Noether symmetry whose associated\nconserved current describes a pressureless \"dust\" fluid which we can identify\nwith the dark matter completely decoupled from the dark energy. The form of\nboth the dark energy and dark matter that results from above class of models is\ninsensitive to the specific form of the scalar field Lagrangian. By adding\nappropriate perturbation, which breaks the above hidden symmetry and along with\nthis it couples dark matter and dark energy, we also suggest a way to obtain\ngrowing dark energy in the present universe's epoch without evolution\npathologies.\n", "  The adiabatic manipulation of quantum states is a powerful technique that has\nopened up new directions in quantum engineering, enabling tests of fundamental\nconcepts such as the Berry phase and its nonabelian generalization, the\nobservation of topological transitions, and holds the promise of alternative\nmodels of quantum computation. Here we benchmark the stimulated Raman adiabatic\npassage process for circuit quantum electrodynamics, by using the first three\nlevels of a transmon qubit. We demonstrate a population transfer efficiency\nabove 80% between the ground state and the second excited state using two\nadiabatic Gaussian-shaped control microwave pulses coupled to the first and\nsecond transition. The advantage of this techniques is robustness against\nerrors in the timing of the control pulses. By doing quantum tomography at\nsuccessive moments during the Raman pulses, we investigate the transfer of the\npopulation in time-domain. We also show that this protocol can be reversed by\napplying a third adiabatic pulse on the first transition. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate a hybrid adiabatic-nonadiabatic gate using a fast pulse followed by\nthe adiabatic Raman sequence, and we study experimentally the case of a\nquasi-degenerate intermediate level.\n", "  When a system thermalizes it loses all local memory of its initial\nconditions. This is a general feature of open systems and is well described by\nequilibrium statistical mechanics. Even within a closed (or reversible) quantum\nsystem, where unitary time evolution retains all information about its initial\nstate, subsystems can still thermalize using the rest of the system as an\neffective heat bath. Exceptions to quantum thermalization have been predicted\nand observed, but typically require inherent symmetries or noninteracting\nparticles in the presence of static disorder. The prediction of many-body\nlocalization (MBL), in which disordered quantum systems can fail to thermalize\nin spite of strong interactions and high excitation energy, was therefore\nsurprising and has attracted considerable theoretical attention. Here we\nexperimentally generate MBL states by applying an Ising Hamiltonian with\nlong-range interactions and programmably random disorder to ten spins\ninitialized far from equilibrium. We observe the essential signatures of MBL:\nmemory retention of the initial state, a Poissonian distribution of energy\nlevel spacings, and entanglement growth in the system at long times. Our\nplatform can be scaled to higher numbers of spins, where detailed modeling of\nMBL becomes impossible due to the complexity of representing such entangled\nquantum states. Moreover, the high degree of control in our experiment may\nguide the use of MBL states as potential quantum memories in naturally\ndisordered quantum systems.\n", "  We investigate in this paper the structures of neutron and quark stars in\nf(T) theory of gravity where T denotes the torsion scalar. Attention is\nattached to the TOV type equations of this theory and numerical integrations of\nthese equations are performed with suitable EoS. We search for the deviation of\nthe mass-radius diagrams for power-law and exponential type correction from the\nTT gravity. Our results show that for some values of the input parameters\nappearing in the considered models, f(T) theory promotes more the structures of\nthe relativistic stars, in consistency with the observational data.\n", "  We have measured the muon flux and production rate of muon-induced neutrons\nat a depth of 611 m water equivalent. Our apparatus comprises three layers of\ncrossed plastic scintillator hodoscopes for tracking the incident cosmic-ray\nmuons and 760 L of gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator for producing and\ndetecting neutrons. The vertical muon intensity was measured to be $I_{\\mu} =\n(5.7 \\pm 0.6) \\times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$. The yield of\nmuon-induced neutrons in the liquid scintillator was determined to be $Y_{n} =\n(1.19 \\pm 0.08 (stat) \\pm 0.21 (syst)) \\times 10^{-4}$\nneutrons/($\\mu\\cdot$g$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}$). A fit to the recently measured neutron\nyields at different depths gave a mean muon energy dependence of $\\left\\langle\nE_{\\mu} \\right\\rangle^{0.76 \\pm 0.03}$ for liquid-scintillator targets.\n", "  We present a set of bilinear matrix identities that generalize the ones that\nhave been used to construct the bright soliton solutions for various models. As\nan example of an application of these identities, we present a simple\nderivation of the N-bright soliton solutions for the Ablowitz-Ladik hierarchy.\n", "  This paper develops solutions of fractional Fokker-Planck equations\ndescribing subdiffusion of probability densities of stochastic dynamical\nsystems driven by non-Gaussian L\\'evy processes, with space-time-dependent\ndrift, diffusion and jump coefficients, thus significantly extends Magdziarz\nand Zorawik's result in \"M.

Amer. Math.\nSoc., Accepted (2015).\" Fractional Fokker-Planck equation describing\nsubdiffusion is solved by our result in full generality from perspective of\nstochastic representation.\n", "  The Standard Model (SM), as the quantum field theory of the strong and\nelectroweak interactions, needs be carried into curved spacetime to incorporate\ngravity. This is done here not for the full but for the effective SM action by\nintegrating-in affine curvature. This approach leads to naturalization of the\nSM Higgs sector and reduction of the cosmological constant down to the neutrino\nscale thanks to the fact that quadratic (quartic) UV contributions to the Higgs\nboson mass (vacuum energy) turn into the Higgs-curvature coupling (the\nEinstein-Hilbert term). New physics beyond the SM, necessary for inducing\ngravity properly, does not have to interact with the SM. It can form a secluded\nsector to source non-interacting dark matter observable via only gravity, or a\nweakly-coupled sector to source dark matter and possible collider signals.\n", "  We prove a deterministic exponential time upper bound for Quantum\nMerlin-Arthur games with k unentangled provers. This is the first non-trivial\nupper bound of QMA(k) better than NEXP and can be considered an exponential\nimprovement, unless EXP=NEXP. The key ideas of our proof are to use\nperturbation theory to reduce the QMA(2)-complete Separable Sparse Hamiltonian\nproblem to a variant of the Separable Local Hamiltonian problem with an\nexponentially small promise gap, and then to decide this instance using\nepsilon-net methods. Our results imply an exponential time algorithm for the\nPure State N-Representability problem in quantum chemistry, which is in QMA(2),\nbut is not known to be in QMA. We also discuss the implications of our results\non the Best Separable State problem.\n", "  We consider Hamiltonian deformations of Gabor systems, where the window\nevolves according to the action of a Schr\\\"odinger propagator and the\nphase-space nodes evolve according to the corresponding Hamiltonian flow. We\nprove the stability of the frame property for small times and Hamiltonians\nconsisting of a quadratic polynomial plus a potential in the Sj\\\"ostrand class\nwith bounded second order derivatives. This answers a question raised in [de\nGosson, M. Symplectic and Hamiltonian Deformations of Gabor Frames. Appl.\nComput. Harmon. Anal. Vol. 38 No.2, (2015) p.196--221.]\n", "  In any flux-density limited sample of blazars, the distribution of the\ntimescale modulation factor $\\Delta t'/\\Delta t$, which quantifies the change\nin observed timescales compared to the rest-frame ones due to redshift and\nrelativistic compression follows an exponential distribution with a mean\ndepending on the flux limit of the sample. In this work we produce the\nmathematical formalism that allows us to use this information in order to\nuncover the underlining rest-frame probability density function of measurable\ntimescales of blazar jets. We extensively test our proposed methodology using a\nsimulated FSRQ population with a 1.5 Jy flux-density limit in the simple case\n(where all blazars share the same intrinsic timescale), in order to identify\nlimits of applicability and potential biases due to observational systematics\nand sample selection. We find that for monitoring with time intervals between\nobservations longer than $\\sim$30\\% of the intrinsic timescale under\ninvestigation the method loses its ability to produce robust results. For time\nintervals of $\\sim$3\\% of the intrinsic timescale the error of the method is as\nlow as 1\\% in recovering the intrinsic rest-frame timescale. We applied our\nmethod to rotations of the optical polarization angle of blazars observed by\nRoboPol. We found that the intrinsic timescales of the longest-duration\nrotation event in each blazar follows a narrow distribution, well-described by\na normal distribution with mean 87 days and standard deviation 5 days. We\ndiscuss possible interpretations of this result.\n", "  The complex interplay of processes at the Galactic Center is at the heart of\nnumerous past, present, and (likely) future mysteries. We aim at a more\ncomplete understanding of how spectra extending to >10 TeV result. We first\nconstruct a simplified model to account for the peculiar energy and angular\ndependence of the intense central parsec photon field. This allows for\ncalculating anisotropic inverse Compton scattering and mapping gamma-ray\nextinction due to gamma gamma -> e^+ e^- attenuation. Coupling these with a\nmethod for evolving electron spectra, we examine several clear and present\nexcesses, including the diffuse hard X-rays seen by NuSTAR and GeV gamma rays\nby Fermi. We address further applications to cosmic rays, dark matter,\nneutrinos, and gamma rays from the Center and beyond.\n", "  The Galactic Center (GC) has been long known to host gamma-ray emission\ndetected to >10 TeV. HESS data now points to two plausible origins: the\nsupermassive black hole (perhaps with >PeV cosmic rays and neutrinos) or\nhigh-energy electrons from the putative X-ray pulsar wind nebula G359.95-0.04\nobserved by Chandra and NuSTAR. We show that if the magnetic field experienced\nby PWN electrons is near the several mG ambient field strength suggested by\nradio observations of the nearby GC magnetar SGR J1745-29, synchrotron losses\nconstrain the TeV gamma-ray output to be far below the data. Accounting for the\npeculiar geometry of GC infrared emission, we also find that the requisite TeV\nflux could be reached if the PWN is ~1 pc from Sgr A* and the magnetic field is\ntwo orders of magnitude weaker, a scenario that we discuss in relation to\nrecent data and theoretical developments. Otherwise, Sgr A* is left, which\nwould then be a PeV link to other AGN.\n", "  Curvelets are efficient to represent highly anisotropic signal content, such\nas a local linear and curvilinear structure. First-generation curvelets on the\nsphere, however, suffered from blocking artefacts. We present a new\nsecond-generation curvelet transform, where scale-discretised curvelets are\nconstructed directly on the sphere. Scale-discretised curvelets exhibit a\nparabolic scaling relation, are well-localised in both spatial and harmonic\ndomains, support the exact analysis and synthesis of both scalar and spin\nsignals, and are free of blocking artefacts. We present fast algorithms to\ncompute the exact curvelet transform, reducing computational complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(L^5)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L^3\\log_{2}{L})$ for signals band-limited at\n$L$. The implementation of these algorithms is made publicly available.\nFinally, we present an illustrative application demonstrating the effectiveness\nof curvelets for representing directional curve-like features in natural\nspherical images.\n", "  Aiming at fabrication of hybrid plasmonic-photonic crystals, gel-immobilized\ncolloidal crystals made of a polystyrene colloidal suspension and an N-(Hydroxy\nmethyl)acrylamid-based gel were immersed into an aqueous dispersion of gold\nnanoparticles. Atomic force microscope (AFM) observations have been performed\nfor the gel-immobilized colloidal crystals with gold nanoparticles deposited on\ntheir surfaces. In the present study, the diameter of a colloidal sphere was\nc.a. 190 nm. The diameter of a gold nanoparticle was the same as in a\npreliminary study, c.a. 40 nm. Various immersion times up to two hours were\ntested. Surface of a sample of 2 hr immersion has been observed. Prior to the\nAFM observation, the sample was dried in a desiccator for 18 hrs. We have\nidentified a face-centered cubic {111} structure of a colloidal crystal of\nnearly close packing. Nanoparticles isolated with one another have been\nobserved on the surface of gel-immobilized crystal, which can be regarded as\ngold nanoparticles from their sizes.\n", "  Rapidly rotating black hole solutions in theories beyond general relativity\nplay a key role in experimental gravity, as they allow us to compute\nobservables in extreme spacetimes that deviate from the predictions of general\nrelativity. Such solutions are often difficult to find in\nbeyond-general-relativity theories due to the inclusion of additional fields\nthat couple to the metric non-linearly and non-minimally. In this paper, we\nconsider rotating black hole solutions in one such theory, dynamical\nChern-Simons gravity, where the Einstein-Hilbert action is modified by the\nintroduction of a dynamical scalar field that couples to the metric through the\nPontryagin density. We treat dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as an effective\nfield theory and work in the decoupling limit, where corrections are treated as\nsmall perturbations from general relativity. We perturb about the\nmaximally-rotating Kerr solution, the so-called extremal limit, and develop\nmathematical insight into the analysis techniques needed to construct solutions\nfor generic spin. First we find closed-form, analytic expressions for the\nextremal scalar field, and then determine the trace of the metric perturbation,\ngiving both in terms of Legendre decompositions. Retaining only the first three\nand four modes in the Legendre representation of the scalar field and the\ntrace, respectively, suffices to ensure a fidelity of over 99% relative to full\nnumerical solutions. The leading-order mode in the Legendre expansion of the\ntrace of the metric perturbation contains a logarithmic divergence at the\nextremal Kerr horizon, which is likely to be unimportant as it occurs inside\nthe perturbed dynamical Chern-Simons horizon. The techniques employed here\nshould enable the construction of analytic, closed-form expressions for the\nscalar field and metric perturbations on a background with arbitrary rotation.\n", "  The ATLAS experiment observed an excess at the $3\\sigma$ level in the channel\nof $Z$ boson, jets and high missing transverse momentum in the full 2012\ndataset at 8 TeV while searching for SUSY. The question arises whether the\nabundance and the kinematical features of this excess are compatible with the\nyet unconstrained supersymmetric realm, respecting at the same time the\nmeasured Higgs boson properties and dark matter density. By trying to explain\nthis signal with SUSY we find that only relatively light gluinos together with\na heavy neutralino NLSP decaying predominantly to a $Z$ boson plus a light\ngravitino could reproduce the excess. We construct an explicit general gauge\nmediation model able to match the observed signal. More sophisticated models\ncould also reproduce the signal, as long as it features light gluinos, or heavy\nparticles with a strong production cross section, producing at least one $Z$\nboson in its decay chain. The implications of our findings for the Run II at\nLHC with the scaling on the $Z$ peak, as well as for the direct search of\ngluinos and other SUSY particles, are also discussed.\n", "  We introduce the concept of metaasabiya, the second non-material resource, to\nthe asabiya theory of historical dynamics. We find that the resulting three\nvariable dynamical system has peculiar features such as repelling or attracting\naxes and spiralling orbits in the phase space. Depending on the initial state,\nthe system can go through series of oscillatory rises and falls, mimicking the\ngeopolitical evolution of real-world polities. These distinctive features,\nabsent in conventional Lotka-Volterra type biological systems, reveal the\nhidden richness inherent in the asabiya theory.\n", "  Motivated by the tantalizing excesses recently reported in the di-photon\ninvariant mass spectrum at the LHC, we scrutinize some implications of scalar\ndi-photon resonances in high energy proton-proton collisions. In particular,\nindications of a large width impose several challenges for model building. We\nshow how calculability and unitarity considerations severely limit possible\nperturbative realizations of such a signal and propose a simple criterion that\ncan be adapted to any renormalizable model. Furthermore, we discuss\ncorrelations between a di-photon excess and precision observables, including\nthe anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of quarks and leptons,\nneutral meson oscillations and radiative flavor changing neutral current\nmediated decays of heavy leptons and hadrons. We find that existing searches\nand measurements significantly constrain the possibilities for a scalar\nresonance decaying into final states involving Standard Model fermions. We\npropose future search strategies which could elucidate some remaining currently\nunconstrained decay channels and discuss possible correlations between the\ndi-photon excess and several recently reported flavor anomalies, showing that\nthe latter can be addressed in a new incarnation of a gauged $U(1)^\\prime$\nmodel, with the di-photon resonance being the physical remnant of the\n$U(1)^\\prime$-breaking field.\n", "  In this paper we study non-linear noise excitation for the following class of\nspace-time fractional stochastic equations in bounded domains:\n$$\\partial^\\beta_tu_t(x)=-\\nu(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} u_t(x)+I^{1-\\beta}_t[\\lambda\n\\sigma(u)\\stackrel{\\cdot}{F}(t,x)]$$ in $(d+1)$ dimensions, where $\\nu>0,\n\\beta\\in (0,1)$, $\\alpha\\in (0,2]$. The operator $\\partial^\\beta_t$ is the\nCaputo fractional derivative, $-(-\\Delta)^{\\alpha/2} $ is the generator of an\nisotropic stable process and $I^{1-\\beta}_t$ is the fractional integral\noperator. The forcing noise denoted by $\\stackrel{\\cdot}{F}(t,x)$ is a Gaussian\nnoise. The multiplicative non-linearity $\\sigma:\\RR{R}\\to\\RR{R}$ is assumed to\nbe globally Lipschitz continuous. These equations were recently introduced by\nMijena and Nane(J. Mijena and E. Nane. Space time fractional stochastic partial\ndifferential equations. Stochastic Process Appl. 125 (2015), no. 9,\n3301--3326). We first study the existence and uniqueness of the solution of\nthese equations {and} under suitable conditions on the initial function, we\n{also} study the asymptotic behavior of the solution with respect to the\nparameter $\\lambda$. In particular, our results are significant extensions of\nthose in Foondun et al (M. Foondun, K. Tian and W. Liu. On some properties of a\nclass of fractional stochastic equations.

In addition, we confirm that\nunwanted extra quantum dots can appear at the surface of the nanowire. Their\npresence is prevented in our devices, and also by inserting a protective layer\nof GaAs between the InAs and Al, the latter being suitable for standard\nmeasurement methods.\n", "  We consider the problem of defining localized subsystems in gauge theory and\ngravity. Such systems are associated to spacelike hypersurfaces with boundaries\nand provide the natural setting for studying entanglement entropy of regions of\nspace. We present a general formalism to associate a gauge-invariant classical\nphase space to a spatial slice with boundary by introducing new degrees of\nfreedom on the boundary. In Yang-Mills theory the new degrees of freedom are a\nchoice of gauge on the boundary, transformations of which are generated by the\nnormal component of the nonabelian electric field. In general relativity the\nnew degrees of freedom are the location of a codimension-2 surface and a choice\nof conformal normal frame. These degrees of freedom transform under a group of\nsurface symmetries, consisting of diffeomorphisms of the codimension-2\nboundary, and position-dependent linear deformations of its normal plane. We\nfind the observables which generate these symmetries, consisting of the\nconformal normal metric and curvature of the normal connection. We discuss the\nimplications for the problem of defining entanglement entropy in quantum\ngravity. Our work suggests that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy may arise from\nthe different ways of gluing together two partial Cauchy surfaces at a\ncross-section of the horizon.\n", "  Some traces of a specific Lorentz symmetry breaking scenario in the ground\nstate of the Hydrogen atom are investigated. It is used standard\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory in order to obtain the corrections\nto the the ground state energy and wave function. It is shown that an induced\nfour-pole moment arises, due to the Lorentz symmetry breaking. The model\nconsidered is the one studied in reference Eur. Phys. J. C {\\bf 74}, 2937\n(2014), where the Lorentz symmetry is broken in the electromagnetic sector.\n", "  We devise a numerical method for passive advection of a surface, such as the\ninterface between two incompressible fluids, across a computational mesh. The\nmethod is called isoAdvector, and is developed for general meshes consisting of\narbitrary polyhedral cells. The algorithm is based on the volume of fluid (VOF)\nidea of calculating the volume of one of the fluids transported across the mesh\nfaces during a time step. The novelty of the isoAdvector concept consists in\ntwo parts: First, we exploit an isosurface concept for modelling the interface\ninside cells in a geometric surface reconstruction step. Second, from the\nreconstructed surface, we model the motion of the face-interface intersection\nline for a general polygonal face to obtain the time evolution within a time\nstep of the submerged face area. Integrating this submerged area over the time\nstep leads to an accurate estimate for the total volume of fluid transported\nacross the face. The method was tested on simple 2D and 3D interface advection\nproblems both on structured and unstructured meshes. The results are very\nsatisfactory both in terms of volume conservation, boundedness, surface\nsharpness, and efficiency. The isoAdvector method was implemented as an\nOpenFOAM(R) extension and is published as open source.\n", "  We report 100% duty cycle generation of sub-MHz single photon pairs at the\nRubidium D$_1$ line using cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric\ndownconversion. The temporal intensity crosscorrelation function exhibits a\nbandwidth of $666 \\pm 16$ kHz for the single photons, an order of magnitude\nbelow the natural linewidth of the target transition. A half-wave plate inside\nour cavity helps to achieve triple resonance between pump, signal and idler\nphoton, reducing the bandwidth and simplifying the locking scheme.\nAdditionally, stabilisation of the cavity to the pump frequency enables the\n100% duty cycle. These photons are well-suited for storage in quantum memory\nschemes with sub-natural linewidths, such as gradient echo memories.\n", "  The strong non-linear increase in Cu interconnect line resistance with a\ndecrease in linewidth presents a significant obstacle to their continued\ndownscaling. In this letter we use first principles density functional theory\nbased electronic structure of Cu interconnects to find the lower limits of\ntheir line resistance for metal linewidths corresponding to future technology\nnodes. We find that even in the absence of scattering due to grain boundaries,\nedge roughness or interfaces, quantum confinement causes a severe reduction in\ncurrent carrying capacity of Cu. We discuss the causes of transport orientation\ndependent anisotropy of quantum confinement in Cu. We also find that when the\nsimplest scattering mechanism in the grain boundary scattering dominated limit\nis added to otherwise coherent electronic transmission in monocrystalline\nnanowires, the lower limits of line resistance are significantly higher than\nprojected roadmap requirements in the International Technology Roadmap for\nSemiconductors.\n", "  In recent years, Majorana physics has attracted considerable attention in\nboth theoretical and experimental studies due to exotic new phenomena and its\nprospects for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. To this end, one\nneeds to engineer the interplay between superconductivity and electronic\nproperties in a topological insulator, but experimental work remains scarce and\nambiguous. Here we report experimental evidence for topological\nsuperconductivity induced in a HgTe quantum well, a two-dimensional topological\ninsulator that exhibits the quantum spin Hall effect. The ac Josephson effect\ndemonstrates that the supercurrent has a $4\\pi$-periodicity with the\nsuperconducting phase difference as indicated by a doubling of the voltage step\nfor multiple Shapiro steps. In addition, an anomalous SQUID-like response to a\nperpendicular magnetic field shows that this $4\\pi$-periodic supercurrent\noriginates from states located on the edges of the junction. Both features\nappear strongest when the sample is gated towards the quantum spin Hall regime,\nthus providing evidence for induced topological superconductivity in the\nquantum spin Hall edge states.\n", "  The galaxy population hosting long-duration GRBs provides a means to\nconstrain the progenitor and an opportunity to use these violent explosions to\ncharacterize the nature of the high-redshift universe. Studies of GRB host\ngalaxies in emission reveal a population of star-forming galaxies with great\ndiversity, spanning a wide range of masses, metallicities, and redshifts.\nHowever, as a population GRB hosts are significantly less massive and poorer in\nmetals than the hosts of other core-collapse transients, suggesting that GRB\nproduction is only efficient at metallicities significantly below Solar. GRBs\nmay also prefer compact galaxies, and dense and/or central regions of galaxies,\nmore than other types of core-collapse explosion. Meanwhile, studies of hosts\nin absorption against the luminous GRB optical afterglow provide a unique means\nof unveiling properties of the ISM in even the faintest and most distant\ngalaxies; these observations are helping to constrain the chemical evolution of\ngalaxies and the properties of interstellar dust out to very high redshifts.\nNew ground- and space-based instrumentation, and the accumulation of larger and\nmore carefully-selected samples, are continually enhancing our view of the GRB\nhost population.\n", "  The relativistic trajectory of a charged particle driven by the Lorentz force\nis different from the classical one, by velocity-dependent relativistic\nacceleration term. Here we show that the evolution of optical polarization\nstates near the polarization singularity can be described in analogy to the\nrelativistic dynamics of charged particles. A phase transition in parity-time\nsymmetric potentials is then interpreted in terms of the competition between\nelectric and magnetic 'pseudo'-fields applied to polarization states. Based on\nthis Lorentz pseudo-force representation, we reveal that zero Lorentz\npseudo-force is the origin of recently reported strong polarization convergence\nto the singular state at the exceptional point. We also demonstrate the\ndeterministic design of achiral and directional eigenstates at the exceptional\npoint, allowing an anomalous linear polarizer which operates orthogonal to\nforward and backward waves. Our results linking parity-time symmetry and\nrelativistic electrodynamics show that previous PT-symmetric potentials for the\npolarization singularity with a chiral eigenstate are the subset of optical\npotentials for the ExB \"polarization\" drift.\n", "  We propose a method to study the thermodynamic behaviour of small systems\nbeyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation, which is different in\nspirit from conventional approaches. The idea is to redefine the system and\nenvironment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly\nto Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent\nthermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve\nthis goal we make use of the reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general\nmethod in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or\nclassical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary\nnumber of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an\nappropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction\ncoordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. We\ndemonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can\nsignificantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat\nengine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show\nfor a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows\none to justify master equations derived in a polaron transformed reference\nframe.\n", "  We develop a covariant scheme to describe the dynamics of small perturbations\non Lovelock type extended objects propagating in a flat Minkowski spacetime.\nThe higher-dimensional analogue of the Jacobi equation in this theory becomes a\nwave type equation for a scalar field $\\Phi$. Whithin this framework, we\nanalyse the stability of membranes with a de Sitter geometry where we find that\nthe Jacobi equation specializes to a Klein-Gordon (KG) equation for $\\Phi$\npossessing a tachyonic mass. This shows that, to some extent, these type of\nextended objects share the symmetries of the Dirac-Nambu-Goto (DNG) action\nwhich is by no means coincidental because the DNG model is the simplest\nincluded in this type of gravity.\n", "  Along with widely used numerical methods for estimating and computing the\nLyapunov dimension there is an effective analytical approach, proposed by G.A.\nLeonov in 1991. The Leonov method is based on the direct Lyapunov method with\nspecial Lyapunov-like functions. The advantage of this method is that it allows\none to estimate the Lyapunov dimension of invariant set without local- ization\nof the set in the phase space and in many cases get effectively exact Lyapunov\ndimension formula. In this survey the invariance of Lyapunov dimension with\nrespect to diffeomorphisms and its connection with the Leonov method are\ndiscussed. An analog of Leonov method for discrete time dynamical systems is\nsuggested. In a simple but rigorous way, here it is presented the connection\nbetween the Leonov method and the key related works in the area: by Kaplan and\nYorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterle (upper\nbounds of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov dimension of maps, 1980),\nConstantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (upper bounds of Hausdorff dimension via the\nLyapunov exponents and dimension of dynamical systems, 1985-90), and the\nnumerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponents and dimension.\n", "  Intrinsic galaxy shape and angular momentum alignments can arise in\ncosmological large-scale structure due to tidal interactions or galaxy\nformation processes. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have recently come\nof age as a tool to study these alignments and their contamination to weak\ngravitational lensing. We probe the redshift and luminosity evolution of\nintrinsic alignments in Horizon-AGN between z=0 and z=3 for galaxies with an\nr-band absolute magnitude of <-20. Alignments transition from being radial at\nlow redshifts and high luminosities, dominated by the contribution of\nellipticals, to being tangential at high redshift and low luminosities, where\ndiscs dominate the signal. This cannot be explained by the evolution of the\nfraction of ellipticals and discs alone: intrinsic evolution in the amplitude\nof alignments is necessary. The alignment amplitude of elliptical galaxies\nalone is smaller in amplitude by a factor of ~2, but has similar luminosity and\nredshift evolution as in current observations and in the nonlinear tidal\nalignment model at projected separations of > 1 Mpc. Alignments of discs are\nnull in projection and consistent with current low redshift observations. The\ncombination of the two populations yields an overall amplitude a factor of ~4\nlower than observed alignments of luminous red galaxies with a steeper\nluminosity dependence. The restriction on accurate galaxy shapes implies that\nthe galaxy population in the simulation is complete only to an r-band absolute\nmagnitude of <-20. Higher resolution simulations will be necessary to avoid\nextrapolation of the intrinsic alignment predictions to the range of\nluminosities probed by future surveys.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the one-loop corrections to the triple\nHiggs coupling in the framework of a simplified 3+1 Dirac neutrino model, that\nis three light neutrinos plus one heavy neutrino embedded in the Standard Model\n(SM). The triple Higgs coupling is a key parameter of the scalar potential\ntriggering the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism in the SM. The impact of\nthe heavy neutrino can be as large as $+20\\%$ to $+30\\%$ for parameter points\nallowed by the current experimental constraints depending on the tightness of\nthe perturbative bound. This can be probed at the high-luminosity LHC, at\nfuture electron-positron colliders and at the Future Circular Collider in\nhadron-hadron mode, an envisioned 100 TeV $pp$ machine. Our calculation, being\ndone in the mass basis, can be extended to any model using the neutrino portal.\nIn addition, the effects that we have calculated are expected to be enhanced if\nadditional heavy fermions with large Yukawa couplings are included, as in\nlow-scale seesaw mechanisms.\n", "  Existence of a minimal measurable length and an upper bound for the momentum\nfluctuations are the casting reasons for generalization of uncertainty\nprinciple and then reformulation of Hilbert space representation of quantum\nmechanics. In this paper, we study the consequences of the Generalized\nUncertainty Principle (GUP) in the presence of both minimal length and maximal\nmomentum. We consider a simple harmonic oscillator in the framework of GUP by\nintroducing it's energy eigenstates and energy spectrum. Investigation of\ncoherent states for a generalized harmonic oscillator and it's generic behavior\nare the other topics in our study.\n", "  In the CLB method, a Bosanquet-type effective viscosity is employed to\naccount for the rarefaction effect on the gas viscosity. To gain accurate\nsimulations and to match the Bosanquet-type effective viscosity, the combined\nbounce-back/specular-reflection boundary scheme with a modified second-order\nslip boundary condition is adopted in the CLB method. The present method is\napplied to study gas flow in a microchannel with periodic boundary condition\nand gas flow in a long microchannel (the ratio of the length to the height\nL/H=100) with pressure boundary condition over a wide range of Knudsen numbers.\nThe influence of the rarefaction effect on the velocity profile, the mass flow\nrate, and the non-linear pressure deviation distribution along the long\nmicrochannel are investigated.\n", "  The fidelity of DNA replication by DNA polymerase (DNAP) has long been an\nimportant issue in biology. While numerous experiments have revealed details of\nthe molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a\npolymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few\ntheoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly\nconsidered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely\naccepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and\nrigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the\nhigher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the\nproofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we\npropose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent\nexperimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We\npresent a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state\nkinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical\nexpressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant\nconditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order\nterminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order\nway, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is\ndominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to\ncalculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with\nprevious intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.\n", "  A general analytical expressions for the cross-section and the polarization\nof nucleons arising in the inclusive deuteron stripping reaction have been\nderived in the diffraction approximation. The nucleon-nucleus phases were\ncalculated in the framework of Glauber formalism and making use of the\ndouble-folding potential. The tabulated distributions of the target nucleus\ndensity and the realistic deuteron wave function with correct asymptotic at\nlarge nucleon-nucleon distances were used. The calculated angular dependences\nfor the cross-sections and the analyzing powers of the $(\\vec{d},p)$ reaction\nare in good agreement with corresponding experimental data.\n", "  Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a theoretical framework to\ntreat finite fragments in the presence of a surrounding molecular or bulk\nenvironment, even when there is significant correlation or entanglement between\nthe two. In this work, we give a practically oriented and explicit description\nof the numerical and theoretical formulation of DMET. We also describe in\ndetail how to perform self-consistent DMET optimizations. We explore different\nembedding strategies with and without a self-consistency condition in hydrogen\nrings, beryllium rings, and a sample S$_{\\text{N}}$2 reaction. The source code\nfor the calculations in this work can be obtained from\n\\url{https://github.com/sebwouters/qc-dmet}.\n", "  We study the collective modes of a one-dimensional harmonically trapped\nBose-Einstein condensate in the presence of the anomalous density using the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Within the hydrodynamic\nequations, we derive analytical expressions for the mode frequencies and the\ndensity fluctuations of the anomalous density which constitutes the minority\ncomponent at very low temperature and feels an effective external potential\nexerted by the majority component, i.e., the condensate. On the other hand, we\nnumerically examine the temperature dependence of the breathing mode\noscillations of the condensate at finite temperature in the weak-coupling\nregime. At zero temperature, we compare our predictions with available\nexperimental data, theoretical treatments, and Monte carlo simulations in all\ninteraction regimes and the remaining hindrances are emphasized. We show that\nthe anomalous correlations have a non-negligible role on the collective modes\nat both zero and finite temperatures.\n", "  We present an efficient preconditioner for the orbital minimization method\nwhen the Hamiltonian is discretized using planewaves (i.e., pseudospectral\nmethod). This novel preconditioner is based on an approximate Fermi operator\nprojection by pole expansion, combined with the sparsifying preconditioner to\nefficiently evaluate the pole expansion for a wide range of Hamiltonian\noperators. Numerical results validate the performance of the new preconditioner\nfor the orbital minimization method, in particular, the iteration number is\nreduced to $O(1)$ and often only a few iterations are enough for convergence.\n", "  A hypothesis of general relativity is that spacetime torsion vanishes\nidentically. This assumption has no empirical support; in fact, a nonvanishing\ntorsion is compatible with all the experimental tests of general relativity.\nThe first part of this essay specifies the framework that is suitable to test\nthe vanishing-torsion hypothesis, and an interesting relation with the\ngravitational degrees of freedom is suggested. In the second part, some\noriginal empirical tests are proposed based on the observation that torsion\ninduces new interactions between different spin-polarized particles.\n", "  We obtain the ultimate quantum limit for estimating the transverse separation\nof two thermal point sources using a given imaging system with limited spatial\nbandwidth. We show via the quantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound that, contrary to the\nRayleigh limit in conventional direct imaging, quantum mechanics does\nnotmandate any loss of precision in estimating even deep sub-Rayleigh\nseparations. We propose two coherent measurement techniques, easily\nimplementable using current linear-optics technology, that approach the quantum\nlimit over an arbitrarily large range of separations. Our bound is valid for\narbitrary source strengths, all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and\nfor any imaging system with an inversion-symmetric point-spread function. The\nmeasurement schemes can be applied to microscopy, optical sensing, and\nastrometry at all wavelengths.\n", "  We study the response to sudden local perturbations of highly excited Quantum\nIsing Spin Chains. The key quantity encoding this response is the overlap\nbetween time-dependent wave functions, which we write as a two-times Loschmidt\necho. Its asymptotics at long time differences contains crucial information\nabout the structure of the highly excited non-equilibrium environment induced\nby the quench. We compute the Echo perturbatively for a weak local quench but\nfor arbitrarily large global quench, using a cumulant expansion. Our\nperturbative results suggest that the Echo decays exponentially, rather than\npower law as in the low-energy Orthogonality Catastrophe, a further example of\nquench-induced decoherence already found in the case of quenched Luttinger\nLiquids. The emerging decoherence scale is set by the strenght of the local\npotential and the bulk excitation energy.\n", "  We propose a new set of Master Integrals which can be used as a basis for\ncertain multiloop calculations in massless gauge field theories. In these\ntheories we consider three-point Feynman diagrams with arbitrary number of\nloops. The corresponding multiloop integrals may be decomposed in terms of this\nset of the Master Integrals. We construct a new reduction procedure which we\napply to perform this decomposition.\n", "  We report on the deterministic coupling between single semiconducting\nnanowire quantum dots emitting in the visible and plasmonic Au nanoantennas.\nBoth systems are separately carefully characterized through\nmicrophotoluminescence and cathodoluminescence. A two-step realignment process\nusing cathodoluminescence allows for electron beam lithography of Au antennas\nnear individual nanowire quantum dots with a precision of 50 nm. A complete set\nof optical properties are measured before and after antenna fabrication. They\nevidence both an increase of the NW absorption, and an improvement of the\nquantum dot emission rate up to a factor two in presence of the antenna.\n", "  A set of uniform carbon microspheres (CS) whose diameters have the order of $\n0.125 \\mu m$ to $10 \\mu m $ was prepared from aqueous sucrose solution by means\nof hydrothermal carbonization of sugar molecules. A pressed pellet was composed\nby mixing CSs with polyethylene oxide (PEO). Electrical characterization of the\npellet was carried out showing Ohmic current-voltage characteristics and\ntemperature-dependent conductivity in the range $ 80K < T < 300K.$ The\nconductivity reached a maximum value of $ 0.245 S/cm $ at $ 258K. $ The\ndependence of conductivity on temperature was theoretically analyzed to\ndetermine predominating mechanisms of electron transport. It was shown that\nthermally-induced electron tunneling between adjacent spheres may take on an\nimportant part in the electron transport through the CS/PEO composites.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate PT-symmetric optical lattices with periodical\ngain and loss profiles in a coherently-prepared four-level N-type atomic\nsystem. By appropriately tuning the pertinent atomic parameters, the onset of\nPT-symmetry breaking is observed through measuring an abrupt phase-shift jump\nbetween adjacent gain and loss waveguides. The experimental realization of such\nreadily reconfigurable and effectively controllable PT-symmetric waveguide\narray structure sets a new stage for further exploiting and better\nunderstanding the peculiar physical properties of these non-Hermitian systems\nin atomic settings.\n", "  In this review we discuss the works in the area of quantum simulation and\nmany-body physics with light, from the early proposals on equilibrium models to\nthe more recent works in driven dissipative platforms. We start by describing\nthe founding works on Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model and the corresponding\nphoton-blockade induced Mott transitions and continue by discussing the\nproposals to simulate effective spin models and fractional quantum Hall states\nin coupled resonator arrays (CRAs). We also analyze the recent efforts to study\nout-of-equilibrium many-body effects using driven CRAs, including the\npredictions for photon fermionization and crystallization in driven rings of\nCRAs as well as other dynamical and transient phenomena. We try to summarise\nsome of the relatively recent results predicting exotic phases such as\nsuper-solidity and Majorana like modes and then shift our attention to\ndevelopments involving one dimensional nonlinear slow light setups. There the\nsimulation of strongly correlated phases characterising Tonks-Girardeau gases,\nLuttinger liquids, and interacting relativistic fermionic models is described.\nWe review the major theory results and also briefly outline recent developments\nin ongoing experimental efforts involving different platforms in circuit QED,\nphotonic crystals and nanophotonic fibers interfaced with cold atoms.\n", "  DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) is a proposed long-baseline\nneutrino experiment in the US with a baseline of 1300 km from Fermi National\nAccelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) to Sanford Underground Research Facility,\nwhich will house a 40 kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) as the\nfar detector. The experiment will also have a fine grained near detector for\naccurately measuring the initial fluxes. We show that the energy range of the\nfluxes and baseline of the DUNE near detector is conducive for observing\n$\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e$ oscillations of $\\Delta m^2 \\sim$ eV$^2$ scale sterile\nneutrinos, and hence can be effectively used for testing to very high accuracy\nthe reported oscillation signal seen by the LSND and MiniBooNE experiments. We\nstudy the sensitivity of the DUNE near detector to sterile neutrino\noscillations by varying the baseline, detector fiducial mass and systematic\nuncertainties. We find that the detector mass and baseline of the currently\nproposed near detector at DUNE will be able to test the entire LSND parameter\nregion with good precision. The dependence of sensitivity on baseline and\ndetector mass is seen to give interesting results, while dependence on\nsystematic uncertainties is seen to be small.\n", "  Interference lies at the heart of the behavior of classical and quantum\nlight. It is thus crucial to understand the boundaries between which\ninterference patterns can be explained by a classical electromagnetic\ndescription of light and which, on the other hand, can only be understood with\na proper quantum mechanical approach. While the case of two-mode interference\nhas received a lot of attention, the multimode case has not yet been fully\nexplored. Here we study a general scenario of intensity interferometry: we\nderive a bound on the average correlations between pairs of output intensities\nfor the classical wavelike model of light, and we show how it can be violated\nin a quantum framework. As a consequence, this violation acts as a\nnonclassicality witness, able to detect the presence of sources with\nsub-Poissonian photon-number statistics. We also develop a criterion that can\ncertify the impossibility of dividing a given interferometer into two\nindependent subblocks.\n", "  We report the measurements of correlations between event-by-event\nfluctuations of amplitudes of anisotropic flow harmonics in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions, obtained for the first time using a new analysis method based on\nmultiparticle cumulants in mixed harmonics. This novel method is robust against\nsystematic biases originating from non-flow effects and by construction any\ndependence on symmetry planes is eliminated. We demonstrate that correlations\nof flow harmonics exhibit a better sensitivity to medium properties than the\nindividual flow harmonics. The new measurements are performed in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at the centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm\nNN}}}=2.76$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The\ncentrality dependence of correlation between event-by-event fluctuations of the\nelliptic, $v_2$, and quadrangular, $v_4$, flow harmonics, as well as of\nanti-correlation between $v_2$ and triangular, $v_3$, flow harmonics are\npresented. The results cover two different regimes of the initial state\nconfigurations: geometry-dominated (in mid-central collisions) and\nfluctuation-dominated (in the most central collisions). Comparisons are made to\npredictions from MC-Glauber, viscous hydrodynamics, AMPT and HIJING models.\nTogether with the existing measurements of individual flow harmonics the\npresented results provide further constraints on initial conditions and the\ntransport properties of the system produced in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  In this article, we investigate both site and bond percolation on a weighted\nplanar stochastic lattice (WPSL) which is a multi-multifractal and whose dual\nis a scale-free network. The characteristic properties of percolation is that\nit exhibits threshold phenomena as we find sudden or abrupt jump in spanning\nprobability across $p_c$ accompanied by the divergence of some other observable\nquantities which is reminiscent of continuous phase transition. Indeed,\npercolation is characterized by the critical behavior of percolation strength\n$P(p)\\sim (p_c-p)^\\beta$, mean cluster size $S\\sim (p_c-p)^{-\\gamma}$ and the\nsystem size $L\\sim (p_c-p)^{-\\nu}$ which are known as the equivalent\ncounterpart of the order parameter, susceptibility and correlation length\nrespectively. Moreover, the cluster size distribution function $n_s(p_c)\\sim\ns^{-\\tau}$ and the mass-length relation $M\\sim L^{d_f}$ of the spanning cluster\nalso provide useful characterization of the percolation process. We obtain an\nexact value for $p_c$ and for all the exponents such as $\\beta, \\nu, \\gamma,\n\\tau$ and $d_f$. We find that, except $p_c$, all the exponents are exactly the\nsame in both bond and site percolation despite the significant difference in\nthe definition of cluster and other quantities. Our results suggest that the\npercolation on WPSL belongs to a new universality class as its exponents do not\nshare the same value as for all the existing planar lattices and like other\ncases its site and bond belong to the same universality class.\n", "  It is well-known that the partition function can consistently be factorized\nfrom the canonical equilibrium distribution obtained through the maximization\nof the Shannon entropy. We show that such a normalized and factorized\nequilibrium distribution is warranted if and only if the entropy measure $I\n\\{(p_i)\\}$ has an additive slope i.e. $\\partial I \\{(p_i)\\} / \\partial p_i$\nwhen the ordinary linear averaging scheme is used. Therefore, we conclude that\nthe maximum entropy principle of Jaynes should not be used for the\njustification of the partition functions and the concomitant thermodynamic\nobservables for generalized entropies with non-additive slope. Finally, Tsallis\nand R\\'enyi entropies are shown not to yield such factorized canonical-like\ndistributions.\n", "  We have studied in this paper, the stability of dynamical system in $f(R)$\ngravity. We have considered the $f(R)$ $\\gamma$-gravity and explored its\ndynamical analysis. We found six critical points among which only one describes\nan universe fulled of both matter and dominated dark energy. It's shown that\nthese critical points presents specific phase spaces described by the\ncorresponding fluids. Furthermore, we've investigated the stability conditions\nof these critical points and find that theses conditions are dependent of the\nmodel parameters. We also study the stability of a new power-law $f_\\ast(R)$\nmodel with de Sitter and power law solutions.\n", "  We use a bootstrap argument to enhance the eigensystem multiscale analysis,\nintroduced by Elgart and Klein for proving localization for the Anderson model\nat high disorder. The eigensystem multiscale analysis studies finite volume\neigensystems, not finite volume Green's functions. It yields pure point\nspectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions and dynamical localization.\nThe starting hypothesis for the eigensystem bootstrap multiscale analysis only\nrequires the verification of polynomial decay of the finite volume\neigenfunctions, at some sufficiently large scale, with some minimal probability\nindependent of the scale. It yields exponential localization of finite volume\neigenfunctions in boxes of side $L$, with the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\nlabeled by the sites of the box, with probability higher than\n$1-\\mathrm{e}^{-L^\\xi}$, for any desired $0<\\xi<1$.\n", "  We investigate the anisotropy in turbulent convection in a 3D box using\ndirect numerical simulation. We compute the anisotropic parameter $A =\nu_\\perp^{2}/(2u_{\\parallel}^{2})$, where $u_{\\perp}$ and $u_{\\parallel}$ are\nthe components of velocity perpendicular and parallel to the buoyancy\ndirection, the shell and ring spectra, and shell-to-shell energy transfers. We\nobserve that the flow is nearly isotropic for the Prandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr}\n\\approx 1$, but the anisotropy increases with the Prandtl number. For\n$\\mathrm{Pr}=\\infty$, $A \\approx 0.3$, thus anisotropy is not very significant\neven in extreme cases. We also observe that $u_{\\parallel}$ feeds energy to\n$u_{\\perp}$ via pressure. The computation of shell-to-shell energy transfers\nreveals that the energy transfer in turbulent convection is local and forward,\nsimilar to hydrodynamic turbulence. These results are consistent with the\nKolmogorov's spectrum observed by Kumar et al.~[Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 90}, 023016\n(2014)] for turbulent convection.\n", "  The key elements of the Babcock-Leighton dynamos are the generation of\npoloidal field through decay and dispersal of tilted bipolar active regions and\nthe generation of toroidal field through the observed differential rotation.\nThese models are traditionally known as flux transport dynamo models as the\nequatorward propagations of the butterfly wings in these models are produced\ndue to an equatorward flow at the bottom of the convection zone. Here we\ninvestigate the role of downward magnetic pumping near the surface using a\nkinematic Babcock-Leighton model. We find that the pumping causes the poloidal\nfield to become predominately radial in the near-surface shear layer, which\nallows the negative radial shear to effectively act on the radial field to\nproduce a toroidal field. We observe a clear equatorward migration of the\ntoroidal field at low latitudes as a consequence of the dynamo wave even when\nthere is no meridional flow in the deep convection zone. Both the dynamo wave\nand the flux transport type solutions are thus able to reproduce some of the\nobserved features of the solar cycle, including the 11-year periodicity. The\nmain difference between the two types of solutions is the strength of the\nBabcock-Leighton source required to produce the dynamo action. A second\nconsequence of the magnetic pumping is that it suppresses the diffusion of\nfields through the surface, which helps to allow an 11-year cycle at\n(moderately) larger values of magnetic diffusivity than have previously been\nused.\n", "  We study nonlinear convection in a rapidly rotating sphere with internal\nheating for values of the Prandtl number relevant for liquid metals\n($Pr\\in[10^{-2},10^{-1}]$). We use a numerical model based on the\nquasi-geostrophic approximation, in which variations of the axial vorticity\nalong the rotation axis are neglected, whereas the temperature field is fully\nthree-dimensional. We identify two separate branches of convection close to\nonset: (i) a well-known weak branch for Ekman numbers greater than $10^{-6}$,\nwhich is continuous at the onset (supercritical bifurcation) and consists of\nthermal Rossby waves, and (ii) a novel strong branch at lower Ekman numbers,\nwhich is discontinuous at the onset. The strong branch becomes subcritical for\nEkman numbers of the order of $10^{-8}$. On the strong branch, the Reynolds\nnumber of the flow is greater than $10^3$, and a strong zonal flow with\nmultiple jets develops, even close to the nonlinear onset of convection. We\nfind that the subcriticality is amplified by decreasing the Prandtl number. The\ntwo branches can co-exist for intermediate Ekman numbers, leading to hysteresis\n($Ek=10^{-6}$, $Pr=10^{-2}$). Nonlinear oscillations are observed near the\nonset of convection for $Ek=10^{-7}$ and $Pr=10^{-1}$.\n", "  Metamaterials are composed of periodic subwavelength metal/dielectric\nstructures that resonantly couple to the electric and/or magnetic components of\nthe incident electromagnetic fields, exhibiting properties that are not found\nin nature. Planar metamaterials with subwavelength thickness, or metasurfaces,\nconsisting of single-layer or few-layer stacks of planar structures, can be\nreadily fabricated using lithography and nanoprinting methods, and the\nultrathin thickness in the wave propagation direction can greatly suppress the\nundesirable losses. Metasurfaces enable a spatially varying optical response,\nmold optical wavefronts into shapes that can be designed at will, and\nfacilitate the integration of functional materials to accomplish active control\nand greatly enhanced nonlinear response. This paper reviews recent progress in\nthe physics of metasurfaces operating at wavelengths ranging from microwave to\nvisible. We provide an overview of key metasurface concepts such as anomalous\nreflection and refraction, and introduce metasurfaces based on the\nPancharatnam-Berry phase and Huygens' metasurfaces, as well as their use in\nwavefront shaping and beam forming applications, followed by a discussion of\npolarization conversion in few-layer metasurfaces and their related properties.\nAn overview of dielectric metasurfaces reveals their ability to realize unique\nfunctionalities coupled with Mie resonances and their low ohmic losses. We also\ndescribe metasurfaces for wave guidance and radiation control, as well as\nactive and nonlinear metasurfaces. Finally, we conclude by providing our\nopinions of opportunities and challenges in this rapidly developing research\nfield.\n", "  The claims made in a manifesto resulting in the European quantum technologies\nflagship initiative in quantum technology and similar enterprises are taken as\nstarting point to critically review some potential quantum resources, such as\ncoherent superposition and entanglement, and their potential usefulness for\nparallelism and communication. Claims of absolute, irreducible (non-epistemic)\nrandomness are argued to be metaphysical. Cryptanalytic man-in-the-middle\nattacks on quantum cryptography are well known to be feasible, but hardly\nmentioned. If all of this is taken into account, a more sober perspective on\nquantum capacities emerges, but one that may be ethically more justified than\nthe \"hype and magic\" that drives many current initiatives.\n", "  The Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) is a state-of-the-art\nnumerical technique for a one dimensional quantum many-body system; but\ncalculating accurate results for a system with Periodic Boundary Condition\n(PBC) from the conventional DMRG has been a challenging job from the inception\nof DMRG. The recent development of the Matrix Product State (MPS) algorithm\ngives a new approach to find accurate results for the one dimensional PBC\nsystem. The most efficient implementation of the MPS algorithm can scale as\nO($p \\times m^3$), where $p$ can vary from 4 to $m^2$. In this paper, we\npropose a new DMRG algorithm, which is very similar to the conventional DMRG\nand gives comparable accuracy to that of MPS. The computation effort of the new\nalgorithm goes as O($m^3$) and the conventional DMRG code can be easily\nmodified for the new algorithm.\n", "  Hot, dense plasmas exhibit screened Coulomb interactions, resulting from the\ncollective effects of correlated many-particle interactions. In the lowest\nparticle correlation order (pair-wise correlations), the interaction between\ncharged plasma particles reduces to the Debye-H\\\"uckel (Yukawa-type) potential,\ncharacterized by the Debye screening length D. Due to the importance of Coulomb\ninteraction screening in dense laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, hundreds\nof theoretical investigations have been carried out in the past few decades on\nthe plasma screening effects on the electronic structure of atoms and their\ncollision processes employing the Debye-H\\\"uckel screening model. The present\narticle aims at providing a comprehensive review of the recent studies in\natomic physics in Debye plasmas. Specifically, the work on atomic electronic\nstructure, photon excitation and ionization, electron/positron impact\nexcitation and ionization, and excitation, ionization and charge transfer of\nion-atom/ion collisions will be reviewed.\n", "  Planck's introduction of the quantum of action in 1900 was followed by 25\nyears of trial and error in quest of the understanding of the quantum world;\ndifferent ideas and directions had to be pursued until the path leading to the\nelementary quantum theory was discovered. Radical changes away from traditional\nperceptions about natural phenomena were necessary, the entire system of basic\nconcepts in classical physics had to be abandoned and replaced by a new mode of\nthought. Continuity and determinism of classical laws were no longer applicable\non the quantum scale, where dynamical behaviour proceeds by discontinuous and\nstatistical quantum transitions. Albert Einstein laid the essential foundations\nfor the new concept; Max Born made the decisive step further leading to the\nbreakthrough in 1925. The development of the ideas, which eventually resulted\nin the elementary quantum theory in 1925/26, will be described, relying on\noriginal publications and letters written during that period in time by the\nmajor contributors. The fundamental laws of Quantum Theory derived by Max Born\nand Pascual Jordan may mathematically be represented in many different ways,\nand particular emphasis is given to the distinction between physical content\nand mathematical representation.\n", "  We propose a novel graphical method for determining the mixing ratios\n{\\delta} and their associated uncertainties for mixed nuclear transitions. It\nincorporates the uncertainties both on both the measured and the theoretical\nconversion coefficients. The accuracy of the method has been studied by\nderiving the corresponding probability density function. The domains of\napplicability of the method are carefully defined.\n", "  Cytoskeletal motor proteins are involved in major intracellular transport\nprocesses which are vital for maintaining appropriate cellular function. The\nmotor exhibits distinct states of motility: active motion along filaments, and\neffectively stationary phase in which it detaches from the filaments and\nperforms passive diffusion in the vicinity of the detachment point due to\ncytoplasmic crowding. The transition rates between motion and pause phases are\nasymmetric in general, and considerably affected by changes in environmental\nconditions which influences the efficiency of cargo delivery to specific\ntargets. By considering the motion of molecular motor on a single filament as\nwell as a dynamic filamentous network, we present an analytical model for the\ndynamics of self-propelled particles which undergo frequent pause phases. The\ninterplay between motor processivity, structural properties of filamentous\nnetwork, and transition rates between the two states of motility drastically\nchanges the dynamics: multiple transitions between different types of anomalous\ndiffusive dynamics occur and the crossover time to the asymptotic diffusive or\nballistic motion varies by several orders of magnitude. We map out the phase\ndiagrams in the space of transition rates, and address the role of initial\nconditions of motion on the resulting dynamics.\n", "  For the purpose of treatment of various cancer and medical research, the\nsynchrotron based medical machine under the Korea Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator\n(KHIMA) project have been conducted and is going to treat the patient at the\nbeginning of 2018. The KHIMA synchrotron is designed to accelerate and extract\nthe carbon ion (proton) beam with various energy range, 110 up to 430 MeV/u (60\nup to 230 MeV). A lattice design and beam optics studies for the High Energy\nBeam Transport (HEBT) line at the KHIMA accelerator system have been carried\nout with WinAgile and the MAD-X codes. Because the magnetic eld errors and the\nmis-alignments introduce to the deviations from the design parameters, these\nerror sources should be treated explicitly and the sensitivity of the machine's\nlattice to di erent individual error sources is considered. Various types of\nerrors which are static and dynamic one have been taken into account and have\nbeen consequentially corrected with a dedicated correction algorithm by using\nthe MAD-X program. As a result, the tolerances for the diverse error\ncontributions have been speci ed for the dedicated lattice components in the\nwhole HEBT lines.\n", "  We study the topological susceptibility in 2+1 flavor QCD above the chiral\ncrossover transition temperature using Highly Improved Staggered Quark action\nand several lattice spacings, corresponding to temporal extent of the lattice,\n$N_\\tau=6,8,10$ and $12$. We observe very distinct temperature dependences of\nthe topological susceptibility in the ranges above and below $250$ MeV. While\nfor temperatures above $250$ MeV, the dependence is found to be consistent with\ndilute instanton gas approximation, at lower temperatures the fall-off of\ntopological susceptibility is milder. We discuss the consequence of our results\nfor cosmology wherein we estimate the bounds on the axion decay constant and\nthe oscillation temperature if indeed the QCD axion is a possible dark matter\ncandidate.\n", "  We present an efficient implementation of dynamically pruned quantum\ndynamics, both in coordinate space and in phase space. We combine the ideas\nbehind the biorthogonal von Neumann basis (PvB) with the orthogonalized\nmomentum-symmetrized Gaussians (Weylets) to create a new basis, projected\nWeylets, that takes the best from both methods. We benchmark pruned dynamics\nusing phase-space-localized PvB, projected Weylets, and\ncoordinate-space-localized DVR bases, with real-world examples in up to six\ndimensions. We show that coordinate-space localization is most important for\nefficient pruning and that pruned dynamics is much faster compared to unpruned,\nexact dynamics. Phase-space localization is useful for more demanding dynamics\nwhere many basis functions are required. There, projected Weylets offer a more\ncompact representation than pruned DVR bases.\n", "  A new method is proposed to numerically integrate a dynamical system on a\nmanifold such that the trajectory stably remains on the manifold and preserves\nfirst integrals of the system. The idea is that given an initial point in the\nmanifold we extend the dynamics from the manifold to its ambient Euclidean\nspace and then modify the dynamics outside the intersection of the manifold and\nthe level sets of the first integrals containing the initial point such that\nthe intersection becomes a unique local attractor of the resultant dynamics.\nWhile the modified dynamics theoretically produces the same trajectory as the\noriginal dynamics, it yields a numerical trajectory that stably remains on the\nmanifold and preserves the first integrals. The big merit of our method is that\nthe modified dynamics can be integrated with any ordinary numerical integrator\nsuch as Euler or Runge-Kutta. We illustrate this method by applying it to three\nfamous problems: the free rigid body, the Kepler problem and a perturbed Kepler\nproblem with rotational symmetry. We also carry out simulation studies to\ndemonstrate the excellence of our method and make comparisons with the standard\nprojection method, a splitting method and St\\\"ormer-Verlet schemes.\n", "  The elliptic, triangular, quadrangular and pentagonal anisotropic flow\ncoefficients for $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{\\pm}$ and p+$\\overline{\\mathrm{p}}$\nin Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV were measured with\nthe ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The results were obtained with\nthe Scalar Product method, correlating the identified hadrons with reference\nparticles from a different pseudorapidity region. Effects not related to the\ncommon event symmetry planes (non-flow) were estimated using correlations in pp\ncollisions and were subtracted from the measurement. The obtained flow\ncoefficients exhibit a clear mass ordering for transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$) values below $\\approx$ 3 GeV/$c$. In the intermediate\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ region ($3 < p_{\\mathrm{T}} < 6$ GeV/$c$), particles group at\nan approximate level according to the number of constituent quarks, suggesting\nthat coalescence might be the relevant particle production mechanism in this\nregion. The results for $p_{\\mathrm{T}} < 3$ GeV/$c$ are described fairly well\nby a hydrodynamical model (iEBE-VISHNU) that uses initial conditions generated\nby A Multi-Phase Transport model (AMPT) and describes the expansion of the\nfireball using a value of 0.08 for the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ($\\eta/s$), coupled to a hadronic cascade model (UrQMD). Finally,\nexpectations from AMPT alone fail to quantitatively describe the measurements\nfor all harmonics throughout the measured transverse momentum region. However,\nthe comparison to the AMPT model highlights the importance of the late hadronic\nrescattering stage to the development of the observed mass ordering at low\nvalues of $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and of coalescence as a particle production\nmechanism for the particle type grouping at intermediate values of\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ for all harmonics.\n", "  The non-stationary relaxation and physical ageing in the diffusion-limited\nerosion process ({\\sc dle}) is studied through the exact solution of its\nLangevin equation, in $d$ spatial dimensions. The dynamical exponent $z=1$, the\ngrowth exponent $\\beta=\\max(0,(1-d)/2)$ and the ageing exponents $a=b=d-1$ and\n$\\lambda_C=\\lambda_R=d$ are found. In $d=1$ spatial dimension, a new\nrepresentation of the meta-conformal Lie algebra, isomorphic to\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\oplus\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, acts as a\ndynamical symmetry of the noise-averaged {\\sc dle} Langevin equation. Its\ninfinitesimal generators are non-local in space. The exact form of the full\ntime-space dependence of the two-time response function of {\\sc dle} is\nreproduced for $d=1$ from this symmetry. The relationship to the\nterrace-step-kink model of vicinal surfaces is discussed.\n", "  In this paper, we deal with the inverse source problem of determining a\nsource in a time fractional diffusion equation where data are given at a fixed\ntime. This problem is ill-posed, i.e., the solution does not depend\ncontinuously on the data. To regularize the instable solution, we use the\ntrigonometric method in nonparametric regression associated with the truncated\nexpansion method. We also investigate the convergence rate.\n", "  We study a simple nonlinear model defined on the honeycomb and triangular\nlattices. We propose a bilinearization scheme for the field equations and\ndemonstrate that the resulting system is closely related to the well-studied\nintegrable models, such as the Hirota bilinear difference equation and the\nAblowitz-Ladik system. This result is used to derive the two sets of explicit\nsolutions: the N-soliton solutions and ones constructed of the Toeplitz\ndeterminants.\n", "  We propose a new method to evaluate jet substructure observables in inclusive\njet measurements, based upon semi-inclusive jet functions in the framework of\nSoft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). As a first example, we consider the jet\nfragmentation function, where a hadron $h$ is identified inside a fully\nreconstructed jet. We introduce a new semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function\n${\\mathcal G}^h_i(z= \\omega_J/\\omega,z_h=\\omega_h/\\omega_J,\\omega_J, R,\\mu)$,\nwhich depends on the jet radius $R$ and the large light-cone momenta of the\nparton `$i$' initiating the jet ($\\omega$), the jet ($\\omega_J$), and the\nhadron $h$ ($\\omega_h$). The jet fragmentation function can then be expressed\nas a semi-inclusive observable, in the spirit of actual experimental\nmeasurements, rather than as an exclusive one. We demonstrate the consistency\nof the effective field theory treatment and standard perturbative QCD\ncalculations of this observable at next-to-leading order (NLO). The\nrenormalization group (RG) equation for the semi-inclusive fragmenting jet\nfunction ${\\mathcal G}_i^h(z,z_h, \\omega_J, R,\\mu)$ are also derived and shown\nto follow exactly the usual timelike DGLAP evolution equations for\nfragmentation functions. The newly obtained RG equations can be used to perform\nthe resummation of single logarithms of the jet radius parameter $R$ up to\nnext-to-leading logarithmic (NLL$_R$) accuracy. In combination with the fixed\nNLO calculation, we obtain NLO+NLL$_R$ results for the hadron distribution\ninside the jet. We present numerical results for $pp\\to(\\mathrm{jet}\\,h)X$ in\nthe new framework, and find excellent agreement with existing LHC experimental\ndata.\n", "  Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of photonic signals preserves quantum\ninformation while simultaneously changing the signal wavelength. A common\napplication of QFC is to translate the wavelength of a signal compatible with\nthe current fiber-optic infrastructure to a shorter wavelength more compatible\nwith high quality single-photon detectors and optical memories. Recent work has\ninvestigated the use of QFC to manipulate and measure specific temporal modes\n(TMs) through tailoring of the pump pulses. Such a scheme holds promise for\nmultidimensional quantum state manipulation that is both low loss and\nre-programmable on a fast time scale. We demonstrate the first QFC temporal\nmode sorting system in a four-dimensional Hilbert space, achieving a conversion\nefficiency and mode separability as high as 92% and 0.84, respectively. A\n20-GHz pulse train is projected onto 6 different TMs, including superposition\nstates, and mode separability with weak coherent signals is verified via photon\ncounting. Such ultrafast high-dimensional photonic signals could enable\nlong-distance quantum communication with high rates.\n", "  Heavy vector-like quarks coupled to a scalar $S$ will induce a coupling of\nthis scalar to gluons and possibly (if electrically charged) photons. The decay\nof the heavy quark into $Sq$, with $q$ being a Standard Model quark, provides,\nif kinematically allowed, new channels for heavy quark searches. Inspired by\nnaturalness considerations, we consider the case of a vector-like partner of\nthe top quark. For illustration, we show that a singlet partner can be searched\nfor at the 13$\\,$TeV LHC through its decay into a scalar resonance in the\n$2\\gamma+\\ell + X$ final states, especially if the diphoton branching ratio of\nthe scalar $S$ is further enhanced by the contribution of non coloured\nparticles. We then show that conventional heavy quark searches are also\nsensitive to this new decay mode, when $S$ decays hadronically, by slightly\ntightening the current selection cuts. Finally, we comment about the\npossibility of disentangling, by scrutinising appropriate kinematic\ndistributions, heavy quark decays to $St$ from other standard decay modes.\n", "  The paper reports on a new plasma startup scenario in the Gas Dynamic Trap\n(GDT) magnetic mirror device. The primary 5 MW neutral beam injection (NBI)\nplasma heating system fires into a sufficiently dense plasma target (\"seed\nplasma\"), which is commonly supplied by an arc plasma generator. In the\nreported experiments, a different approach to seed plasma generation is\nexplored. One of the channels of the electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) heating\nsystem is used to ionize the neutral gas and build up the density of plasma to\na level suitable for NBI capture. After a short transition (about 1 ms) the\ndischarge becomes essentially similar to a standard one initiated by the plasma\ngun. The paper presents the discharge scenario and experimental data on the\nseed plasma evolution during ECR heating, along with the dependencies on\nincident microwave power, magnetic configuration and pressure of a neutral gas.\nThe characteristics of consequent high-power NBI discharge are studied and\ndifferences to the conventional scenario are discussed. A theoretical model\ndescribing the ECR breakdown and the seed plasma accumulation in a large scale\nmirror trap is developed on the basis of the GDT experiment.\n", "  We investigate the collective plasmonic modes in a chain of metallic\nnanoparticles that are coupled by near-field interactions. The size- and\nmomentum-dependent nonradiative Landau damping and radiative decay rates are\ncalculated analytically within an open quantum system approach. These decay\nrates determine the excitation propagation along the chain. In particular, the\nbehavior of the radiative decay rate as a function of the plasmon wavelength\nleads to a transition from an exponential decay of the collective excitation\nfor short distances to an algebraic decay for large distances. Importantly, we\nshow that the exponential decay is of a purely nonradiative origin. Our\ntransparent model enables us to provide analytical expressions for the\npolarization-dependent plasmon excitation profile along the chain and for the\nassociated propagation length. Our theoretical analysis constitutes an\nimportant step in the quest for the optimal conditions for plasmonic\npropagation in nanoparticle chains.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of an effective field theory which includes the\nStandard Model particle content extended by a pair of Weyl fermionic\nSU(2)-doublets with opposite hypercharges. A discrete symmetry guarantees that\na linear combination of the doublet components is stable and can act as a\ncandidate particle for Dark Matter. The dark sector fermions interact with the\nHiggs and gauge bosons through renormalizable $d=4$ operators, and\nnon-renormalizable $d=5$ operators that appear after integrating out extra\ndegrees of freedom above the TeV scale. We study collider, cosmological and\nastrophysical probes for this effective theory of Dark Matter. We find that a\nWIMP with a mass nearby to the electroweak scale, and thus observable at LHC,\nis consistent with collider and astrophysical data only when fairly large\nmagnetic dipole moment transition operators with the gauge bosons exist,\ntogether with moderate Yukawa interactions.\n", "  In this paper we develop a novel needlet-based estimator to investigate the\ncross-correlation between cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps and\nlarge-scale structure (LSS) data. We compare this estimator with its harmonic\ncounterpart and, in particular, we analyze the bias effects of different forms\nof masking. In order to address this bias, we also implement a MASTER-like\ntechnique in the needlet case. The resulting estimator turns out to have an\nextremely good signal-to-noise performance. Our analysis aims at expanding and\noptimizing the operating domains in CMB-LSS cross-correlation studies,\nsimilarly to CMB needlet data analysis. It is motivated especially by next\ngeneration experiments (such as Euclid) which will allow us to derive much\ntighter constraints on cosmological and astrophysical parameters through\ncross-correlation measurements between CMB and LSS.\n", "  We derive the spectrum and the total cross section of electromagnetic\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production in the collisions of two nuclei at low relative\nvelocity $\\beta$. Both free-free and bound-free $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair production is\nconsidered. The parameters $\\eta_{A,B}=Z_{A,B}\\alpha$ are assumed to be small\ncompared to unity but arbitrary compared to $\\beta$ ($Z_{A,B}$ are the charge\nnumbers of the nuclei and $\\alpha$ is the fine structure constant). Due to a\nsuppression of the Born term by high power of $\\beta$, the first Coulomb\ncorrection to the amplitude appears to be important at $\\eta_{A,B}\\gtrsim\n\\beta$. The effect of a finite nuclear mass is discussed. In contrast to the\nresult obtained in the infinite nuclear mass limit, the terms $\\propto M^{-2}$\nare not suppressed by the high power of $\\beta$ and may easily dominate at\nsufficiently small velocities.\n", "  We apply the framework of Rychkov-Tan arXiv:1505.00963 to the codimension two\ntwist defect at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. We\nobtain the scaling dimensions of the operators on the defect up to the lowest\nnontrivial order in the $\\epsilon$-expansion without using Feynman diagram\ncomputation. Our results agree with the known results.\n", "  Perovskite oxides form an eclectic class of materials owing to their\nstructural flexibility in accommodating cations of different sizes and\nvalences. They host well known point and planar defects, but so far no line\ndefect has been identified other than dislocations. Using analytical scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM) and ab initio calculations we have\ndetected and characterized the atomic and electronic structures of a novel line\ndefect in NdTiO3 perovskite. It appears in STEM images as a perovskite cell\nrotated by 45 degrees. It consists of self-organized Ti-O vacancy lines\nreplaced by Nd columns surrounding a central Ti-O octahedral chain containing\nTi4+ ions, as opposed to Ti3+ in the host. The distinct Ti valence in this line\ndefect introduces the possibility of engineering exotic conducting properties\nin a single preferred direction and tailoring novel desirable functionalities\nin this Mott insulator.\n", "  We demonstrate tunable Schottky barrier height and record photo-responsivity\nin a new-concept device made of a single-layer CVD graphene transferred onto a\nmatrix of nanotips patterned on n-type Si wafer. The original layout, where\nnano-sized graphene/Si heterojunctions alternate to graphene areas exposed to\nthe electric field of the Si substrate, which acts both as diode cathode and\ntransistor gate, results in a two-terminal barristor with single-bias control\nof the Schottky barrier. The nanotip patterning favors light absorption, and\nthe enhancement of the electric field at the tip apex improves photo-charge\nseparation and enables internal gain by impact ionization. These features\nrender the device a photodetector with responsivity (3 A/W for white LED light\nat 3 mW/cm2 intensity) almost an order of magnitude higher than commercial\nphotodiodes. We extensively characterize the voltage and the temperature\ndependence of the device parameters and prove that the multi-junction approach\ndoes not add extra-inhomogeneity to the Schottky barrier height distribution.\nThis work represents a significant advance in the realization of graphene/Si\nSchottky devices for optoelectronic applications.\n", "  We explore thermodynamic properties of a new class of Horndeski black holes\nwhose action contains a non-minimal kinetic coupling of a massless real scalar\nand the Einstein tensor. Our treatment is based on the well-accepted\nconsideration, where the cosmological constant is dealt with as thermodynamic\npressure and the mass of black holes as thermodynamic enthalpy. We resort to a\nnewly introduced intensive thermodynamic variable, i.e., the coupling strength\nof the scalar and tensor whose dimension is length square, and thus yield both\nthe generalized first law of thermodynamics and the generalized Smarr relation.\nOur result indicates that this class of Horndeski black holes presents rich\nthermodynamic behaviors and critical phenomena. Especially in the case of the\npresence of an electric field, these black holes undergo two phase transitions.\nOnce the charge parameter exceeds its critical value, or the cosmological\nparameter does not exceed its critical value, no phase transitions happen and\nthe black holes are stable. As a by-product, we point out that the coupling\nstrength acts as the thermodynamic pressure in the behavior of thermodynamics.\n", "  We investigate the electrical conductivity and thermoelectric effects in\ntopological crystalline insulators in the presence of short- and long-range\nimpurity interactions. We employ the generalized Boltzmann formalism for\nanisotropic Fermi surface systems. The conductivity exhibits a local minimum as\ndoping varies owing to the Van Hove singularity in the density of states\noriginated from the saddle point in the surface states band structure.\nSuppression of the interband scattering of the charge carriers at high-energy\nDirac points results in a maximum in the electrical conductivity. Whenever the\nFermi level passes an extremum in the conductivity, Seebeck coefficient changes\nsign. In addition, it is revealed that profound thermoelectric effects can be\nattained around these extrema points.\n", "  We find a simple analytic solution in open string field theory which, in the\non-shell limit, generates a tower of higher spin vertex operators in bosonic\nstring theory. The solution is related to irregular off-shell vertex operators\nfor Gaiotto states. The wavefunctions for the irregular vertex operators are\ndescribed by equations following from the cubic effective action for\ngeneralized rolling tachyons, indicating that the evolution from flat to\ncollective higher-spin background in string field theory occurs according to\ncosmological pattern. We discuss the relation between nonlocalities of the\nrolling tachyon action and those of higher spin interactions.\n", "  Considering stationary states of continuous-variable systems undergoing an\nopen dynamics, we unveil the connection between properties and symmetries of\nthe latter and the dynamical parameters. In particular, we explore the relation\nbetween the Lyapunov equation for dynamical systems and the steady-state\nsolutions of a time-independent Lindblad master equation for bosonic modes.\nExploiting bona-fide relations that characterize some genuine quantum\nproperties (entanglement, classicality, and steerability), we obtain conditions\non the dynamical parameters for which the system is driven to a steady-state\npossessing such properties. We also develop a method to capture the symmetries\nof a steady state based on symmetries of the Lyapunov equation. All the results\nand examples can be useful for steady-state engineering process.\n", "  We propose a version of functional renormalization-group (fRG) approach,\nwhich is, due to including Litim-type cutoff and switching off (or reducing)\nthe magnetic field during fRG flow, capable describing singular Fermi liquid\n(SFL) phase, formed due to presence of local moments in quantum dot structures.\nThe proposed scheme allows to describe the first-order quantum phase transition\nfrom \"singular\" to the \"regular\" paramagnetic phase with applied gate voltage\nto parallel quantum dots, symmetrically coupled to leads, and shows sizable\nspin splitting of electronic states in the SFL phase in the limit of vanishing\nmagnetic field $H\\rightarrow 0$; the calculated conductance shows good\nagreement with the results of the numerical renormalization group. Using the\nproposed fRG approach with the counterterm, we also show that for asymmetric\ncoupling of the leads to the dots the SFL behavior similar to that for the\nsymmetric case persists, but with occupation numbers, effective energy levels\nand conductance changing continuously through the quantum phase transition into\nSFL phase.\n", "  We present a superconformal tensor calculus for an arbitrary number of five\ndimensional N=2 linear multiplets. We also demonstrate how to construct higher\nderivative invariants and higher order supersymmetric off-diagonal models.\nFinally, we show the procedure required for the derivation of the\nsupersymmetric completion of the non-Abelian $F^4$ action.\n", "  Smith and Tombleson (2015) asserted that statistical tests disprove the\nstandard view of LBVs, and proposed a far more complex scenario to replace it.\nBut Humphreys et al. (2016) showed that Smith and Tombleson's Magellanic \"LBV\"\nsample was a mixture of physically different classes of stars, and genuine LBVs\nare in fact statistically consistent with the standard view. Smith (2016)\nrecently objected at great length to this result. Here we note that he\nmisrepresented some of the arguments, altered the test criteria, ignored some\nlong-recognized observational facts, and employed inadequate statistical\nprocedures. This case illustrates the dangers of uncareful statistical\nsampling, as well as the need to be wary of unstated assumptions.\n", "  When analyzing the perception of Hawking radiation by different observers,\nthe Hawking effect becomes mixed with the Unruh effect. The separation of both\neffects is not always clear in the literature. Here we propose an\ninconsistency-free interpretation of what constitutes a Hawking effect and what\nan Unruh effect. An appropriate interpretation is important in order to\nelucidate what sort of effects a detector might experience depending on its\ntrajectory and the state of the quantum field. Under simplifying assumptions we\nintroduce an analytic formula that separates these two effects. Armed with the\nprevious interpretation we argue that for a free-falling detector to cross the\nhorizon without experiencing high-energy effects, it is necessary that the\nhorizon crossing is not attempted at low velocities.\n", "  We derive a general energy balance equation for a self-interacting boson gas\nat vanishing temperature in a curved spacetime. This represents a first step\ntowards a formulation of the first law of thermodynamics for a scalar field in\ngeneral relativity. By using a $3+1$ foliation of the spacetime and performing\na Madelung transformation, we rewrite the Klein-Gordon-Maxwell equations in a\ngeneral curved spacetime into its hydrodynamic version where we can identify\nthe different energy contributions of the system and separate them into\nkinetic, quantum, electromagnetic, and gravitational.\n", "  Theories based upon strong real space (r-space) electron electron\ninteractions have long predicted that unidirectional charge density modulations\n(CDM) with four unit cell (4$a_0$) periodicity should occur in the hole doped\ncuprate Mott insulator (MI). Experimentally, however, increasing the hole\ndensity p is reported to cause the conventionally defined wavevector $Q_A$ of\nthe CDM to evolve continuously as if driven primarily by momentum space\n(k-space) effects. Here we introduce phase resolved electronic structure\nvisualization for determination of the cuprate CDM wavevector. Remarkably, this\nnew technique reveals a virtually doping independent locking of the local CDM\nwavevector at $|Q_0|=2\\pi/4a_0$ throughout the underdoped phase diagram of the\ncanonical cuprate $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8$. These observations have significant\nfundamental consequences because they are orthogonal to a k-space (Fermi\nsurface) based picture of the cuprate CDM but are consistent with strong\ncoupling r-space based theories. Our findings imply that it is the latter that\nprovide the intrinsic organizational principle for the cuprate CDM state.\n", "  Recently it has been recognized that many complex social, technological and\nbiological networks have a multilayer nature and can be described by multiplex\nnetworks. Multiplex networks are formed by a set of nodes connected by links\nhaving different connotations forming the different layers of the multiplex.\nCharacterizing the centrality of the nodes in a multiplex network is a\nchallenging task since the centrality of the node naturally depends on the\nimportance associated to links of a certain type. Here we propose to assign to\neach node of a multiplex network a centrality called Functional Multiplex\nPageRank that is a function of the weights given to every different pattern of\nconnections (multilinks) existent in the multiplex network between any two\nnodes. Since multilinks distinguish all the possible ways in which the links in\ndifferent layers can overlap, the Functional Multiplex PageRank can describe\nimportant non-linear effects when large relevance or small relevance is\nassigned to multilinks with overlap. Here we apply the Functional Page Rank to\nthe multiplex airport networks, to the neuronal network of the nematode\nc.elegans, and to social collaboration and citation networks between\nscientists. This analysis reveals important differences existing between the\nmost central nodes of these networks, and the correlations between their so\ncalled \"pattern to success\".\n", "  In this paper, we study the holographic models of s-wave and p-wave\nJosephoson junction away from probe limit in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime,\nrespectively. With the backreaction of the matter, we obtained the anisotropic\nblack hole solution with the condensation of matter fields. We observe that the\ncritical temperature of Josephoson junction decreases with increasing\nbackreaction. In addition to this, the tunneling current and condenstion of\nJosephoson junction become smaller as backreaction grows larger, but the\nrelationship between current and phase difference still holds for sine\nfunction. Moreover, condenstion of Josephoson junction deceases with increasing\nwidth of junction exponentially.\n", "  We theoretically address the effects of strong magnetic fields in\nthree-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs) built out of Weyl nodes with a\nmonopole charge $n$. For $n=1$, $2$, and $3$ we realize single, double, and\ntriple WSM, respectively, and the monopole charge $n$ determines the integer\ntopological invariant of the WSM. Within the linearized continuum description,\nthe quasiparticle spectrum is then composed of Landau levels (LLs), containing\nexactly $n$ number of chiral zeroth Landau levels (ZLLs), irrespective of the\norientation of the magnetic field. In the presence of strong backscattering,\nfor example, (due to quenched disorder associated with random impurities),\nthese systems generically give rise to longitudinal magnetotransport.\nRestricting ourselves to the quantum limit (and assuming only the subspace of\nthe ZLLs to be partially filled) and mainly accounting for Gaussian impurities,\nwe show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) in all members of the\nWeyl family displays a positive linear-$B$ scaling, when the field is applied\nalong the axis that separates the Weyl nodes. But, in double and triple WSM,\nLMC displays a smooth crossover to a nonlinear $B$-dependence as the field is\ntilted away from such a high-symmetry direction. In addition, due to the\nenhanced density of states, the LL quantization can trigger instabilities\ntoward the formation of translational symmetry breaking density-wave orderings\nfor sufficiently weak interaction (BCS instability), which gaps out the ZLLs.\nConcomitantly as the temperature (magnetic field) is gradually decreased\n(increased) the LMC becomes negative. Thus WSMs with arbitrary monopole charge\n($n$) can host an intriguing interplay of LL quantization, longitudinal\nmagnetotransport (a possible manifestation of one-dimensional chiral or axial\nanomaly), and density-wave ordering, when placed in a strong magnetic field.\n", "  Epitaxial thin films of 1T-HfTe2 semimetal are grown by MBE on AlN(0001)\nsubstrates. The measured in-plane lattice parameter indicates an unstrained\nfilm which is also azimuthally aligned with the AlN substrate, albeit with an\nin-plane mosaic spread, as it would be expected for van der Waals epitaxy.\nAngle resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with first principles\nelectronic band structure calculations show steep linearly dispersing\nconduction and valence bands which cross near the Brillouin zone center,\nproviding evidence that HfTe2 /AlN is an epitaxial topological Dirac semimetal.\n", "  Microwave heating of a high-temperature plasma confined in a large-scale open\nmagnetic trap, including all important wave effects like diffraction,\nabsorption, dispersion and wave beam aberrations, is described for the first\ntime within the first-principle technique based on consistent Maxwell's\nequations. With this purpose, the quasi-optical approach is generalized over\nweakly inhomogeneous gyrotrotropic media with resonant absorption and spatial\ndispersion, and a new form of the integral quasi-optical equation is proposed.\nAn effective numerical technique for this equation's solution is developed and\nrealized in a new code QOOT, which is verified with the simulations of\nrealistic electron cyclotron heating scenarios at the Gas Dynamic Trap at the\nBudker Institute of Nuclear Physics (Novosibirsk, Russia).\n", "  We study the settling of finite-size rigid spheres in sustained homogeneous\nisotropic turbulence (HIT) by direct numerical simulations using an immersed\nboundary method to account for the dispersed solid phase. We study semi-dilute\nsuspensions at different Galileo numbers, Ga. The Galileo number is the ratio\nbetween buoyancy and viscous forces, and is here varied via the solid-to-fluid\ndensity ratio. The focus is on particles that are slightly heavier than the\nfluid. We find that in HIT, the mean settling speed is less than that in\nquiescent fluid; in particular, it reduces by 6%-60% with respect to the\nterminal velocity of an isolated sphere in quiescent fluid as the ratio between\nthe latter and the turbulent velocity fluctuations is decreased. Analysing the\nfluid-particle relative motion, we find that the mean settling speed is\nprogressively reduced while reducing the density ratio due to the increase of\nthe vertical drag induced by the particle cross-flow velocity. Unsteady effects\ncontribute to the mean overall drag by about 6%-10%. The probability density\nfunctions of particle velocities and accelerations reveal that these are\nclosely related to the features of the turbulent flow. The particle mean-square\ndisplacement in the settling direction is found to be similar for all Ga if\ntime is scaled by (2a)/u' (where 2a is the particle diameter and u' is the\nturbulence velocity root mean square).\n", "  During the process of structure formation in the universe matter is converted\ninto radiation through a variety of processes such as light from stars,\ninfrared radiation from cosmic dust and gravitational waves from binary black\nholes/neutron stars and supernova explosions. The production of this\nastrophysical radiation background (ARB) could affect the expansion rate of the\nuniverse and the growth of perturbations. Here, we aim at understanding to\nwhich level one can constraint the ARB using future cosmological observations.\nWe model the energy transfer from matter to radiation through an effective\ninteraction between matter and astrophysical radiation. Using future supernova\ndata from LSST and growth-rate data from Euclid we find that the ARB density\nparameter is constrained, at the 95% confidence level, to be\n$\\Omega_{ar_0}<0.008$. Estimates of the energy density produced by well-known\nastrophysical processes give roughly $\\Omega_{ar_0}\\sim 10^{-5}$. Therefore, we\nconclude that cosmological observations will only be able to constrain exotic\nor not-well understood sources of radiation.\n", "  The description of the dynamics of a complex, high-dimensional system in\nterms of a low-dimensional set of collective variables Y can be fruitful if the\nlow dimensional representation satisfies a Langevin equation with drift and\ndiffusion coefficients which depend only on Y. We present a computational\nscheme to evaluate whether a given collective variable provides a faithful\nlow-dimensional representation of the dynamics of a high-dimensional system.\nThe scheme is based on the framework of finite-difference Langevin-equation,\nsimilar to that used for molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows one to\ncalculate the drift and diffusion coefficients in any point of the\nfull-dimensional system. The width of the distribution of drift and diffusion\ncoefficients in an ensemble of microscopic points at the same value of Y\nindicates to which extent the dynamics of Y is described by a simple Langevin\nequation. Using a simple protein model we show that collective variables often\nused to describe biopolymers display a non-negligible width both in the drift\nand in the diffusion coefficients. We also show that the associated effective\nforce is compatible with the equilibrium free--energy calculated from a\nmicroscopic sampling, but results in markedly different dynamical properties.\n", "  In this article, we study the ground states and the first radial excited\nstates of the tensor-tensor type scalar hidden-charm tetraquark states with the\nQCD sum rules. We separate the ground state contributions from the first radial\nexcited state contributions unambiguously, and obtain the QCD sum rules for the\nground states and the first radial excited states, respectively. Then we search\nfor the Borel parameters and continuum threshold parameters according to four\ncriteria and obtain the masses of the tensor-tensor type scalar hidden-charm\ntetraquark states, which can be confronted to the experimental data in the\nfuture.\n", "  We discuss a linearization procedure of nonlinear supersymmetry (NLSUSY)\nbased on the closure of the commutator algebra for variations of functionals of\nNambu-Goldstone fermions and their derivative terms under NLSUSY\ntransformations in Volkov-Akulov NLSUSY theory. In the case of a set of bosonic\nand fermionic functionals, which leads to (massless) vector linear\nsupermultiplets, we explicitly show that general linear SUSY transformations of\nbasic components defined from those functionals are uniquely determined by\nexamining the commutation relation in the NLSUSY theory.\n", "  Fermions hopping on a hexagonal lattice represent one of the most active\nresearch field in condensed matter since the discovery of graphene in 2004 and\nits numerous applications. Another exciting aspect of the interplay between\ngeometry and quantum mechanical effects is given by the Haldane model (F. D. M.\nHaldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 61, 2015 (1988)) where spinless fermions experiencing\na certain flux pattern on the honeycomb lattice leads to the stabilization of a\ntopological phase of matter, distinct from a Mott insulator and dubbed Chern\ninsulator nowadays. In this context, it is crucial to understand the role of\ninteractions and this review will describe recent results that have been\nobtained for a minimal model, namely spinless fermions fermions with nearest\nand next-nearest neighbour density-density interactions on the honeycomb\nlattice at half-filling.\n  Topics addressed include an introduction of the minimal model and a\ndiscussion of the possible instabilities of the Dirac semimetal, a presentation\nof various theroretical and numerical approaches, and a summary of the results\nwith a particular emphasis on the stability or not of some exotic quantum\nphases such as charge ordered ones (similar to Wigner crystals) or spontaneous\nChern insulator phase.\n", "  It is shown that appearance of inertial range of scales, adjacent to\ndistributed chaos range, results in adiabatic invariance of an energy\ncorrelation integral for isotropic homogeneous turbulence and for buoyancy\ndriven turbulence (with stable or unstable stratification, including\nRayleigh-Taylor mixing zone). Power spectrum of velocity field for distributed\nchaos dominated by this adiabatic invariant has a stretched exponential form\n$\\propto \\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{3/5}$. Results of recent direct numerical\nsimulations have been used in order to support these conclusions.\n", "  Gravitational couplings in bulk space-time include those terms which are\nfixed by scattering amplitude of strings and ambiguous terms that are coming\nfrom the field redefinitions. These field redefinitions can be fixed in the\nbulk by ghost-free condition. In this paper we have revised the effective\ngravitational couplings on D-branes by including the field redefinitions. We\nfind the gravitational effective action up to $\\alpha'^2$-order.\n", "  Black phosphorus has attracted interest as a material for use in\noptoelectronic devices due to many favorable properties such as a high carrier\nmobility, field-effect, and a direct bandgap that can range from 0.3 eV in its\nbulk crystalline form to 2 eV for a single atomic layer. The low bandgap energy\nfor bulk black phosphorus allows for direct transition photoabsorption that\nenables detection of light out to mid-infrared frequencies. In this work we\ncharacterize the room temperature optical response of a black phosphorus\nphotoconductive detector at wavelengths ranging from 1.56 $\\mu$m to 3.75\n$\\mu$m. Pulsed autocorrelation measurements in the near-infrared regime reveal\na strong, sub-linear photocurrent nonlinearity with a response time of 1 ns,\nindicating that gigahertz electrical bandwidth is feasible. Time resolved\nphotoconduction measurements covering near- and mid-infrared frequencies show a\nfast 65 ps rise time, followed by a carrier relaxation with a time scale that\nmatches the intrinsic limit determined by autocorrelation. The sublinear\nphotoresponse is shown to be caused by a reduction in the carrier relaxation\ntime as more energy is absorbed in the black phosphorus flake and is well\ndescribed by a carrier recombination model that is nonlinear with excess\ncarrier density. The device exhibits a measured noise-equivalent power of 530\npW/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ which is the expected value for Johnson noise limited\nperformance. The fast and sensitive room temperature photoresponse demonstrates\nthat black phosphorus is a promising new material for mid-infrared\noptoelectronics.\n", "  The MB-pol many-body potential has recently emerged as an accurate molecular\nmodel for water simulations from the gas to the condensed phase. In this study,\nthe accuracy of MB-pol is systematically assessed across the three phases of\nwater through extensive comparisons with experimental data and high-level ab\ninitio calculations. Individual many-body contributions to the interaction\nenergies as well as vibrational spectra of water clusters calculated with\nMB-pol are in excellent agreement with reference data obtained at the coupled\ncluster level. Several structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of\nthe liquid phase at atmospheric pressure are investigated through classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature. The structural\nproperties of the liquid phase are in nearly quantitative agreement with X-ray\ndiffraction data available over the temperature range from 268 to 368 K. The\nanalysis of other thermodynamic and dynamical quantities emphasizes the\nimportance of explicitly including nuclear quantum effects in the simulations,\nespecially at low temperature, for a physically correct description of the\nproperties of liquid water. Furthermore, both densities and lattice energies of\nseveral ice phases are also correctly reproduced by MB-pol. Following a recent\nstudy of DFT models for water, a score is assigned to each computed property,\nwhich demonstrates the high and, in many respects, unprecedented accuracy of\nMB-pol in representing all three phases of water.\n", "  We consider a particular truncation of the generalized Proca field theory in\nfour dimensions for which we construct a static and axisymmetric rotating black\nhole \"stealth solutions\", namely solutions with (Anti) de Sitter or Kerr metric\nbut non-trivial vector field. The static configuration is promoted to a\nbackreacting black hole with asymptotic (Anti) de Sitter behavior by turning on\na nonlinear electrodynamic source given as a fixed power of the Maxwell\ninvariant. Finally we extend our solutions to arbitrary dimensions.\n", "  We report the detection of a new feature at the centre of NGC 1275 in the\nPerseus cluster, hosting the radio source 3C 84. This feature emerges ~ 2 mas\n(~ 0.8 pc) north of the central core in recent 15 and 43 GHz VLBA images, and\nseems to be the counterjet to a known radio jet expanding to the south of the\ncore. Apparently, the two jets were born through an outburst around 2005. From\nthe ratio of the apparent lengths of the two jets from the core, we found that\nthe jet angle to the line of sight is \\theta=65^\\circ\\pm 16^\\circ, which is not\nmuch different from the angle of the outer jets generated by an activity around\n1959 and constrains theories on gamma-ray emission from jets. The new northern\njet has a strongly inverted spectrum in contrast with the southern jet. This\nsuggests that the central black hole is surrounded by a subparsec-scale\naccretion disk with the density of >~ 10^5 cm^-3. The brightness of the\ncounterjet suggests that the disk is highly inhomogeneous. The ambient gas\ndensity in the direction of the jet is ~ 8 cm^-3 if the current jet activity is\nsimilar to the past average.\n", "  The basic beer-brewing industrial practices have barely changed over time.\nWhile well proven and stable, they have been refractory to substantial\ninnovation. Technologies harnessing hydrodynamic cavitation have emerged since\nthe 1990s' in different technical fields including the processing of liquid\nfoods, bringing in advantages such as acceleration of extraction processes,\ndisinfection and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, so far beer-brewing processes\nwere not investigated. The impacts of controlled hydrodynamic cavitation,\nmanaged by means of a dedicated unit on a real microbrewery scale (230 L), on\nthe beer-brewing processes is the subject of this paper. The physico-chemical\nfeatures of the obtained products, analyzed by means of professional\ninstruments, were compared with both literature data and data from the outcomes\nof a traditional equipment. Traditional processes such as dry milling of malts\nand wort boiling becoming entirely unnecessary, dramatic reduction of\nsaccharification temperature, acceleration and increase of starch extraction\nefficiency, relevant energy saving, while retaining safety, reliability,\nscalability, virtually universal application to any brewing recipe, beer\nquality, were the most relevant experimental results. The impacts of these\nfindings are potentially far reaching, beer being the worldwide most widely\nconsumed alcoholic beverage, therefore highly relevant to health, environment,\nthe economy and even to local identities.\n", "  The holographic configurations dual to Wilson loops in higher rank\nrepresentations in the ABJM theory are described by branes with electric flux\nalong their world volumes. In particular, D2 and D6 branes with electric flux\nplay a central role as potential dual to totally symmetric and totally\nantisymmetric representations, respectively. We compute the spectra of\nexcitations of these brane configurations in both, the bosonic and fermionic\nsectors. We highlight a number of aspects that distinguish these configurations\nfrom their D3 and D5 cousins including new peculiar mixing terms in the\nfluctuations. We neatly organize the spectrum of fluctuations into the\ncorresponding supermultiplets.\n", "  We investigate the resonance interaction energy between two uniformly\naccelerated identical atoms, interacting with the scalar field or the\nelectromagnetic field in the vacuum state, in the reference frame\ncoaccelerating with the atoms. We assume that one atom is excited and the other\nin the ground state, and that they are prepared in their correlated symmetric\nor antisymmetric state. Using perturbation theory, we separate, at the second\norder in the atom-field coupling, the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and\nradiation reaction field to the energy shift of the interacting system. We show\nthat only the radiation reaction term contributes to the resonance interaction\nbetween the two atoms, while Unruh thermal fluctuations, related to the vacuum\nfluctuations contribution, do not affect the resonance interatomic interaction.\nWe also show that the resonance interaction between two uniformly accelerated\natoms, recently investigated in the comoving (locally inertial) frame, can be\nrecovered in the coaccelerated frame, without the additional assumption of the\nFulling-Davies-Unruh temperature for the quantum fields (as necessary for the\nLamb-shift, for example). This indicates, in the case considered, the\nequivalence between the coaccelerated frame and the locally inertial frame.\n", "  Alfv\\'enic turbulence in space is usually imbalanced: amplitudes of waves\npropagating parallel and anti-parallel to the mean magnetic field $B_0$ are\nunequal. It is commonly accepted that the turbulence is driven by\n(counter-)collisions between these counter-propagating wave fractions. Contrary\nto this, we found a new ion-scale dynamical range of the turbulence established\nby (co-)collisions among waves co-propagating in the same direction along\n$B_0$. Co-collisions become stronger than counter-collisions and produce steep\nnon-universal spectra above certain wavenumbers dependent on the imbalance.\nSpectral indexes of the strong turbulence vary around -3, such that steeper\nspectra follow larger imbalances. Intermittency steepens the -3 spectra\nfurther, up to -3.7. Our theoretical predictions are compatible with steep\nvariable spectra observed in the solar wind at ion kinetic scales, but further\nverifications are needed by correlating observed spectra with measured\nimbalances.\n", "  We consider the linearization of $N = 1$ nonlinear supersymmetry (NLSUSY)\nbased on a commutator algebra in Volkov-Akulov NLSUSY theory. We show\nexplicitly that $U(1)$ gauge and scalar supermultiplets in addition to a vector\nsupermultiplet with general auxiliary fields in linear SUSY theories are\nobtained from a same set of bosonic and fermionic functionals (composites)\nwhich are expressed as simple products of the powers of a Nambu-Goldstone\nfermion and a fundamental determinant in the NLSUSY theory.\n", "  A method is presented to solve the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations with\narbitrary distributions of vortices. The real-space Green's function approach\nbased on Chebyshev polynomials is complemented by a gauge transformation which\nallows one to treat finite as well as infinite, ordered as well as disordered\nvortex configurations. This tool gives unprecedented access to vortex lattices\nat very low magnetic fields and glassy phases. After describing in detail the\nmethod and its implementation, we use it to address a series of problems\nrelated to $d$-wave superconductivity on the square lattice. We first study the\ncontinuity of the vortex-core energy spectrum and its evolution from the\nquantum regime to the semiclassical limit; we investigate the effect of the\nband structure on the vortex by following the self-consistent solution through\na Lifshitz transition; we then study the evolution from the vortex lattice to\nthe isolated-vortex limit with decreasing field and show that a new emerging\nlength scale controls this transition; finally, we perform a statistical study\nof the vortex-core local density of states in the presence of positional\ndisorder in the vortex lattice. The calculations reveal a number of qualitative\ndifferences between the properties of vortices in the quantum and semiclassical\nregimes.\n", "  Recently proposed classical analogs of topological insulators in phononic\nlattices have the advantage of much more accessible experimental realization as\ncompared to conventional materials. Drawn to their potential practical\nstructural applications, we investigate how disorder, which is generically\nnon-negligible in macroscopic realization, can attenuate the topologically\nprotected edge (TPE) modes that constitute robust transmitting channels at zero\ndisorder. We simulate the transmission of phonon modes in a\nquasi-one-dimensional classical lattice waveguide with mass disorder, and show\nthat the TPE mode transmission remains highly robust ($\\Xi\\sim1$) in the\npresence of uncorrelated disorder, but diminishes when disorder is spatially\ncorrelated. This reduction in transmittance is attributed to the Anderson\nlocalization of states within the mass disorder domains. By contrast, non-TPE\nchannels exhibit qualitatively different behavior, with spatial correlation in\nthe mass disorder leading to significant transmittance reduction (enhancement)\nat low (high) frequencies. Our results demonstrate how topologically protected\nedge modes drastically modify the effect of spatial correlation on mode\nlocalization.\n", "  We consider ultracold atoms inside a ring optical cavity that supports a\nsingle plane-wave mode. The cavity field, together with an external coherent\nlaser field, drives a two-photon Raman transition between two internal\npseudo-spin states of the atom. This gives rise to an effective coupling\nbetween atom's pseudo-spin and external center-of-mass (COM) motion. For the\ncase of a single atom inside the cavity, We show how the spin-orbit coupling\nmodifies the static and dynamic properties of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model.\nIn the case of many atoms in thermodynamic limit, we show that the spin-orbit\ncoupling modifies the Dicke superradiance phase transition boundary and the\nnon-superradiant normal phase may become reentrant in some regimes.\n", "  Four-dimensional compactifications of string theory provide a controlled set\nof possible gauge representations accounting for BSM particles and dark sector\ncomponents. In this review, constraints from perturbative Type II string\ncompactifications in the geometric regime are discussed in detail and then\ncompared to results from heterotic string compactifications and\nnon-perturbative/non-geometric corners. As a prominent example, an open string\nrealization of the QCD axion is presented. The status of deriving the\nassociated low-energy effective action in four dimensions is discussed and open\navenues of major phenomenological importance are highlighted. As examples, a\nmechanism of closed string moduli stabilization by D-brane backreaction as well\nas one-loop threshold corrections to the gauge couplings and balancing a low\nstring scale $M_{\\text{string}}$ with unisotropic compact dimensions are\ndiscussed together with implications on potential future new physics\nobservations. For illustrative purposes, an explicit example of a globally\nconsistent D6-brane model with MSSM-like spectrum on $T^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times\n\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\times \\Omega {\\cal R})$ is presented.\n", "  Advances in electron beam technology have been central to creating the\ncurrent generation of x-ray free electron lasers and ultra-fast electron\nmicroscopes. These once exotic devices have become essential tools for basic\nresearch and applied science. One important beam technology for both is the\nelectron source which, for many of these instruments, is the photocathode gun.\nThe invention of the photocathode gun and the concepts of emittance\ncompensation and beam matching in the presence of space charge and RF forces\nhave made these high-quality beams possible. Achieving even brighter beams\nrequires taking a finer resolution view of the electron dynamics near the\ncathode during photoemission and the initial acceleration of the beam. In\naddition, the high-brightness beam is more sensitive to degradation by the\noptical aberrations of the gun's field and the magnetic lenses. This paper\ndiscusses these topics including the beam properties due to photoemission\nphysics, space charge effects close to the cathode, and optical distortions\nintroduced by the RF and solenoid fields. Analytic relations for these\nphenomena are derived and compared with numerical simulations.\n", "  We evaluate one-interval R\\'enyi entropy and entanglement entropy for the\nexcited states of two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) on a cylinder,\nand examine their differences from the ones for the thermal state. We assume\nthe interval to be short so that we can use operator product expansion (OPE) of\ntwist operators to calculate R\\'enyi entropy in terms of sum of one-point\nfunctions of OPE blocks. We find that the entanglement entropy for highly\nexcited state and thermal state behave the same way after appropriate\nidentification of the conformal weight of the state with the temperature.\nHowever, there exists no such universal identification for the R\\'enyi entropy\nin the short-interval expansion. Therefore, the highly excited state does not\nlook thermal when comparing its R\\'enyi entropy to the thermal state one. As\nthe R\\'enyi entropy captures the higher moments of the reduced density matrix\nbut the entanglement entropy only the average, our results imply that the\nemergence of thermality depends on how refined we look into the entanglement\nstructure of the underlying pure excited state.\n", "  Polyakov loops $L_a(T), a=3,8,...$ are shown to give the most important\nnonperturbative contribution to the thermodynamic potentials. Derived from the\ngluonic field correlators they enter as factors into free energy. It is shown\nin the $SU(3)$ case that $L_a (T)$ define to a large extent the behavior of the\nfree energy and the trace anomaly $I(T)$, most sensitive to nonperturbative\neffects.\n", "  We consider the self-interaction phenomenon in the framework of the\nBopp-Podolsky electrodynamics. In the present paper, we obtain the\nself-interaction potential energy of a charge at rest for the spacetimes with\ntopological defects of two types: for the axially symmetric spacetime of the\nstraight cosmic string and the spherically symmetric global monopole spacetime.\nIt is shown that the behavior of this expression depends essentially on the\nangular defect, in spite of the Bopp-Podolsky model parameter, which plays the\nrole of a scale factor. In contrast with the usual Maxwell electrodynamics, the\nself-interaction energy for the Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics appears to be\nfinite everywhere and the standard renormalization procedure is not required.\n", "  We present a non-destructive method to probe a complex quantum system using\nmultiple impurity atoms as quantum probes. Our protocol provides access to\ndifferent equilibrium properties of the system by changing its coupling to the\nprobes. In particular, we show that measurements with two probes reveal the\nsystem's non-local two-point density correlations, for probe-system contact\ninteractions. We illustrate our findings with analytic and numerical\ncalculations for the Bose-Hubbard model in the weakly and strongly-interacting\nregimes, under conditions relevant to ongoing experiments in cold atom systems.\n", "  We study a simple nonlinear vector model defined on the honeycomb lattice. We\npropose a bilinearization scheme for the field equations and demonstrate that\nthe resulting system is closely related to the well-studied integrable models,\nsuch as the Hirota bilinear difference equation and the Ablowitz-Ladik system.\nThis result is used to derive the N-soliton solutions.\n", "  The problem of time-dependent particle transport in quantum conductors is\nnowadays a well established topic. In contrast, the way in which energy and\nheat flow in mesoscopic systems subjected to dynamical drivings is a relatively\nnew subject that cross-fertilize both fundamental developments of quantum\nthermodynamics and practical applications in nanoelectronics and quantum\ninformation. In this short review, we discuss from a thermodynamical\nperspective recent investigations on nonstationary heat and work generated in\nquantum systems, emphasizing open questions and unsolved issues.\n", "  We derive a closed expression for the number of nonnegative solutions of a\ncertain system of linear Diophantine equations. The motivation comes from high\nenergy physics where the nonnegative solutions play a crucial role in the\nperturbative calculation for a class of Lagrangians describing the interaction\nof an atom with a boson field or a non-linear interaction of boson fields among\nthemselves (the so-called interacting phi^n models). The linear system can be\nsolved and the nonnegative solutions enumerated but a closed expression for the\nnumber of solutions is preferable to counting the solutions. Interestingly, the\nproblem led to a construction of a simpler linear Diophantine system whose\nnonnegative number of solutions turns out to be the magic constant.\n", "  The morphology and cluster membership of the Galactic open clusters - Czernik\n20 and NGC 1857 were analyzed using two different clustering algorithms. We\npresent the maiden use of density-based spatial clustering of applications with\nnoise (DBSCAN) to determine open cluster morphology from spatial distribution.\nThe region of analysis has also been spatially classified using a statistical\nmembership determination algorithm. We utilized near infrared (NIR) data for a\nsuitably large region around the clusters from the United Kingdom Infrared Deep\nSky Survey Galactic Plane Survey star catalogue database, and also from the Two\nMicron All Sky Survey star catalogue database. The densest regions of the\ncluster morphologies (1 for Czernik 20 and 2 for NGC 1857) thus identified were\nanalyzed with a K-band extinction map and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). To\naddress significant discrepancy in known distance and reddening parameters, we\ncarried out field decontamination of these CMDs and subsequent isochrone\nfitting of the cleaned CMDs to obtain reliable distance and reddening\nparameters for the clusters (Czernik 20: D = 2900 pc; E(J-K) = 0.33; NGC 1857:\nD = 2400 pc; E(J-K) = 0.18-0.19). The isochrones were also used to convert the\nluminosity functions for the densest regions of Czernik 20 and NGC 1857 into\nmass function, to derive their slopes. Additionally, a previously unknown\nover-density consistent with that of a star cluster is identified in the region\nof analysis.\n", "  We review the nuclear parton distribution functions computed on the basis of\nour microscopic model taking into account a number of nuclear effects including\nFermi motion and nuclear binding, nuclear meson-exchange currents, off-shell\ncorrections to bound nucleon distributions and nuclear shadowing. We discuss\napplications to a number of different processes including lepton-nucleus deep\ninelastic scattering, proton-nucleus Drell-Yan lepton pair production at\nFermilab, as well as $W^\\pm$ and $Z^0$ boson production in proton-lead\ncollisions at the LHC.\n", "  In this work, we study the hadronic loop contribution to the $\\Upsilon(5S)\\to\n\\Upsilon(1^3D_J)\\eta$ ($J=1,2,3$) transitions. We predict that the branching\nratios of $\\Upsilon(5S)\\to \\Upsilon(1^3D_1)\\eta$, $\\Upsilon(5S)\\to\n\\Upsilon(1^3D_2)\\eta$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)\\to \\Upsilon(1^3D_3)\\eta$ can reach up\nto $(0.5\\sim5.1)\\times10^{-3}$, $(0.7\\sim7.5)\\times10^{-3}$ and\n$(0.9\\sim9.6)\\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Since these predicted hadronic\ntransitions of $\\Upsilon(5S)$ are comparable with these observed\n$\\Upsilon(5S)\\to \\Upsilon(nS)\\pi^+\\pi^-$ $(n=1,2,3)$, we suggest future\nexperiment like Belle and BelleII to carry out the search for these anomalous\n$\\Upsilon(5S)\\to \\Upsilon(1^3D_J)\\eta$ transitions.\n", "  We study gravitational stealth configurations emerging on a charged dilatonic\n$(1+1)$-D black hole spacetime. We accomplish this by considering the coupling\nof a non-minimally scalar field $\\phi$ and a self-interacting scalar field\n$\\Psi$ living in a $(1+1)$-D charged black hole background. In addition, the\nself-interacting potential for $\\Psi$ is obtained which exhibits transitions\nfor some specific values of the non-minimal parameter. Atypically, we found\nthat the solutions for these stealth scalar fields do not have a dependence on\nthe temporal coordinate.\n", "  We investigate the growth of a class of networks in which a new node first\npicks a mediator at random and connects with $m$ randomly chosen neighbors of\nthe mediator at each time step. We show that degree distribution in such a\nmediation-driven attachment (MDA) network exhibits power-law $P(k)\\sim\nk^{-\\gamma(m)}$ with a spectrum of exponents depending on $m$. To appreciate\nthe contrast between MDA and Barab\\'{a}si-Albert (BA) networks, we then discuss\ntheir rank-size distribution. To quantify how long a leader, the node with the\nmaximum degree, persists in its leadership as the network evolves, we\ninvestigate the leadership persistence probability $F(\\tau)$ i.e. the\nprobability that a leader retains its leadership up to time $\\tau$. We find\nthat it exhibits a power-law $F(\\tau)\\sim \\tau^{-\\theta(m)}$ with persistence\nexponent $\\theta(m) \\approx 1.51 \\ \\forall \\ m$ in the MDA networks and\n$\\theta(m) \\rightarrow 1.53$ exponentially with $m$ in the BA networks.\n", "  The equivalence between the $\\mathrm{Schr\\ddot{o}dinger}$ dynamics of a\nquantum system with a finite number of basis states and a classical dynamics is\nrealized in terms of electric networks. The isomorphism that connects in a\nunivocal way both dynamical systems was applied to the case of neutral mesons,\nkaons in particular, and the class of electric networks univocally related to\nthe quantum system was analyzed. Moreover, under $CPT$ invariance, the relevant\n$\\epsilon$ parameter that measures $CP$ violation in the kaon system is\nreinterpreted in terms of network parameters. All these results were explicitly\nshown by means of both a numerical simulation of the implied networks and by\nconstructing the corresponding circuits.\n", "  Recently some 4d asymptotically $AdS_2 \\times S^2$ regular bubbling solutions\nwritten in terms of an arbitrary profile function has appeared in literature.\nWe discuss the possibility of extending these solutions to asymptotically flat\nspaces, therefore building a model for an horizonless and singularity-free\nfuzzball with the same asymptotic charges of the associated black hole,\ndirectly in general relativity. A negative conclusion is reached within an\naxial-symmetric ansatz inside the IWP family.\n", "  Morse potential $V_M(x)= g^2\\exp (2x)-g(2h+1)\\exp(x)$ is defined on the full\nline, $-\\infty<x<\\infty$ and it defines an exactly solvable 1-d quantum\nmechanical system with finitely many discrete eigenstates. By taking its right\nhalf $0\\le x<\\infty$ and glueing it with the left half of its mirror image\n$V_M(-x)$, $-\\infty<x\\le0$, the symmetric Morse potential $V(x)= g^2\\exp\n(2|x|)-g(2h+1)\\exp(|x|)$ is obtained. The quantum mechanical system of this\npiecewise analytic potential has infinitely many discrete eigenstates with the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions given by the Whittaker W function. The eigenvalues\nare the square of the zeros of the Whittaker function $W_{k,\\nu}(x)$ and its\nlinear combination with $W'_{k,\\nu}(x)$ as a function of $\\nu$ with fixed $k$\nand $x$. This quantum mechanical system seems to offer an interesting example\nfor discussing the Hilbert-P\\'olya conjecture on the pure imaginary zeros of\nRiemann zeta function on Re$(s)=\\tfrac12$.\n", "  In this work we have obtained the set of new exact solutions of the Einstein\nequations that generalize the known Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi solution for the\ncertain case of nonzero pressure under zero spatial curvature. These solutions\nare pretending to describe the black hole immersed in the nonstatic\ncosmological background and give a possibility to investigate the problems\nconcerning the effects of the cosmological expansion in gravitationally bounded\nsystems. They may also be used as a seed models in the problem of structure\nformation in the universe at the epoch of matter and radiation decoupling. It\nwas shown that each of the solutions obtained contains either the\nReissner-Nordstrom or the Schwarzschild black hole in the central region of the\nspace. It is demonstrated that the approach of the mass function use in solving\nthe Einstein equations allows clear physical interpretation of the resulting\nsolutions that is of much benefit to any their further application.\n", "  We derive conditions under which a general nonlinear mechanical system can be\nexactly reduced to a lower-dimensional model that involves only the most\nflexible degrees of freedom. This Slow-Fast Decomposition (SFD) enslaves\nexponentially fast the stiff degrees of freedom to the flexible ones as all\noscillations converge to the reduced model defined on a slow manifold. We\nobtain an expression for the domain boundary beyond which the reduced model\nceases to be relevant due to a generic loss of stability of the slow manifold.\nWe also find that near equilibria, the SFD gives a mathematical justification\nfor two modal-reduction methods used in structural dynamics: static\ncondensation and modal derivatives. These formal reduction procedures, however,\nare also found to return incorrect results when the SFD conditions do not hold.\nWe illustrate all these results on mechanical examples.\n", "  We study phase conjugation in a nonlinear composite slab when the counter\npropagating pump waves are completely absorbed by means of coherent perfect\nabsorption. Under the undepleted pump approximation the coupling constant and\nthe phase conjugated reflectivity are shown to undergo a substantial increase\nand multivalued response. The effect can be used for efficient switching of the\nphase conjugated reflectivity in photonic circuits.\n", "  A common approach to studying $\\beta$-delayed proton emission is to measure\nthe energy of the emitted proton and corresponding nuclear recoil in a\ndouble-sided silicon-strip detector (DSSD) after implanting the $\\beta$-delayed\nproton emitting ($\\beta$p) nucleus. However, in order to extract the\nproton-decay energy, the measured energy must be corrected for the additional\nenergy implanted in the DSSD by the $\\beta$-particle emitted from the $\\beta$p\nnucleus, an effect referred to here as $\\beta$-summing. We present an approach\nto determine an accurate correction for $\\beta$-summing. Our method relies on\nthe determination of the mean implantation depth of the $\\beta$p nucleus within\nthe DSSD by analyzing the shape of the total (proton + recoil + $\\beta$) decay\nenergy distribution shape. We validate this approach with other mean\nimplantation depth measurement techniques that take advantage of energy\ndeposition within DSSDs upstream and downstream of the implantation DSSD.\n", "  The existence of the miscibility gap in the Cu-Ni system has been an issue in\nboth computational and experimental discussions for half a century [Chakrabarti\net al., Phase diagrams of binary nickel alloys, ASM, 1991]. Here we propose a\nnew miscibility gap in the Cu-Ni system measured in nano-layered thin films by\nSecondary Neutral Mass Spectrometry. The maximum of the symmetrical miscibility\ncurve is around 800~K at Cu50%Ni50%. To our best knowledge, this is the first\nexperiment determining the miscibility from the measurement of the atomic\nfraction of Copper and Nickel in the whole composition range. Needless to say\nthat Ni, Cu and its alloys are important in various fields, accordingly this\nresult affects different areas to understand materials sciences.\n", "  These lecture notes discuss methods, recent results and future prospects in\nproton-proton physics at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Ladder operators for the simplest version of a rationally extended quantum\nharmonic oscillator (REQHO) are constructed by applying a Darboux\ntransformation to the quantum harmonic oscillator system. It is shown that the\nphysical spectrum of the REQHO carries a direct sum of a trivial and an\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representation of the polynomially deformed\nbosonized osp(1|2) superalgebra. In correspondence with this the ground state\nof the system is isolated from other physical states but can be reached by\nladder operators via non-physical energy eigenstates, which belong to either an\ninfinite chain of similar eigenstates or to the chains with generalized Jordan\nstates. We show that the discrete chains of the states generated by ladder\noperators and associated with physical energy levels include six basic\ngeneralized Jordan states, in comparison with the two basic Jordan states\nentering in analogous discrete chains for the quantum harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We study perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime in a coordinate-free,\ncovariant form. The GHP formulation, having the advantage of not only being\ncovariant but also tetrad-rotation invariant, is used to write down the\npreviously known odd- and even-parity gauge-invariants and the equations they\nsatisfy. Additionally, in the even-parity sector, a new invariant and the\nsecond order hyperbolic equation it satisfies are presented. Chandrasekhar's\nwork on transformations of solutions for perturbation equations on\nSchwarzschild spacetime is translated into the GHP form, i.e., solutions for\nthe equations of the even- and odd-parity invariants are written in terms of\none another, and the extreme Weyl scalars; and solutions for the equations of\nthese latter invariants are also written in terms of one another. Recently,\nfurther gauge invariants previously used by Steven Detweiler have been\ndescribed. His method is translated into GHP form and his basic invariants are\npresented here. We also show how these invariants can be written in terms of\ncurvature invariants.\n", "  The optical properties of thermally annealed TiO2 samples depend on their\npreparation process, and the TiO2 thin films usually exist in the form of\nanatase or rutile or the mixture of the two phases. The electronic structures\nand optical properties of anatase and rutile TiO2 are calculated by means of\nFirst-principles generalized gradient approximation (GGA) +U approach. By\nIntroducing the Coulomb interactions on 3d orbitals of Ti atom (Ud) and 2p\norbitals of O atom (Up), we can reproduce the experimental values of the band\ngap. The optical properties of anatase and rutile TiO2 are obtained by means of\nGGA+U method, well agreeing with experimental results and other theoretical\ndata. Further we present the comparison of the electronic structure,\nbirefringence and anisotropy between the two phases of TiO2.\n", "  Dynamics of the nuclear fragmentations and the charge exchange reactions in\npion-nucleus collisions near the $\\Delta$(1232) resonance energies has been\ninvestigated within the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD) transport\nmodel. An isospin, momentum and density-dependent pion-nucleon potential is\nimplemented in the model, which influences the pion dynamics, in particular the\nkinetic energy spectra, but weakly impacts the fragmentation mechanism. The\nabsorption process in pion-nucleon collisions to form the $\\Delta$(1232)\nresonance dominates the heating mechanism of target nucleus. The excitation\nenergy transferred to the target nucleus increases with the pion kinetic energy\nand is similar for both $\\pi^{-}$ and $\\pi^{+}$ induced reactions. The\nmagnitude of fragmentation of target nucleus weakly depends on the pion energy.\nThe isospin ratio in the pion double charge exchange is influenced by the\nisospin ingredient of target nucleus.\n", "  To demonstrate that matrices of seesaw type lead to a hieararchy in the\nneutrino masses, i.e. that there is a large gap in the singular spectrum of\nthese matrices, one generally uses an approximate block-diagonalization\nprocedure. In this note we show that no approximation is required to prove this\ngap property if the Courant-Fisher-Weyl theorem is used instead. This simple\nobservation might not be original, however it does not seem to show up in the\nliterature. We also sketch the proof of additional inequalities for the\nsingular values of matrices of seesaw type.\n", "  What makes a material a good ice nucleating agent? Despite the importance of\nheterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to\nmicrobiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still\nprevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the\nability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a\nfunction of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation\nrates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of\ncoarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal,\nvarying the water-surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It\nturns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice,\ncustomarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice\nnucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other\nhand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity\ncan significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the\nformation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have\npinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be\npromoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer\nthat acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer\nbuckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with\nvery high interaction strength. We hope that this extensive systematic study\nwill foster future experimental work aimed at testing the physiochemical\nunderstanding presented herein.\n", "  2MASS J07024146-0235017 = GDS J0702414-023501 was included in the \"Catalogue\nenriched with R CrB stars\" on grounds of its near- and mid-infrared colours.\nThe object, which corresponds to the carbon star IRAS 07001-0230 = CGCS 6197,\nhas been found to exhibit large amplitude variability in its Bochum Galactic\nDisk Survey light curve. Taking into account all available data, GDS\nJ0702414-023501 is here proposed as a new candidate Mira star.\n", "  We report the quantum efficiency of photoluminescence processes of Er optical\ncenters as well as the thermal quenching mechanism in GaN epilayers prepared by\nmetal-organic chemical vapor deposition. High resolution infrared spectroscopy\nand temperature dependence measurements of photoluminescence intensity from Er\nions in GaN under resonant excitation excitations were performed. Data provide\na picture of the thermal quenching processes and activation energy levels. By\ncomparing the photoluminescence from Er ions in the epilayer with a reference\nsample of Er-doped SiO2, we find that the fraction of Er ions that emits photon\nat 1.54 micron upon a resonant optical excitation is approximately 68%. This\nresult presents a significant step in the realization of GaN:Er epilayers as an\noptical gain medium at 1.54 micron.\n", "  A general diffuse interface model with a realistic equation of state (e.g.\nPeng-Robinson equation of state) is proposed to describe the multi-component\ntwo-phase fluid flow based on the principles of the NVT-based framework which\nis a latest alternative over the NPT-based framework to model the realistic\nfluids. The proposed model uses the Helmholtz free energy rather than Gibbs\nfree energy in the NPT-based framework. Different from the classical routines,\nwe combine the first law of thermodynamics and related thermodynamical\nrelations to derive the entropy balance equation, and then we derive a\ntransport equation of the Helmholtz free energy density. Furthermore, by using\nthe second law of thermodynamics, we derive a set of unified equations for both\ninterfaces and bulk phases that can describe the partial miscibility of two\nfluids. A relation between the pressure gradient and chemical potential\ngradients is established, and this relation leads to a new formulation of the\nmomentum balance equation, which demonstrates that chemical potential gradients\nbecome the primary driving force of fluid motion. Moreover, we prove that the\nproposed model satisfies the total (free) energy dissipation with time. For\nnumerical simulation of the proposed model, the key difficulties result from\nthe strong nonlinearity of Helmholtz free energy density and tight coupling\nrelations between molar densities and velocity. To resolve these problems, we\npropose a novel convex-concave splitting of Helmholtz free energy density and\ndeal well with the coupling relations between molar densities and velocity\nthrough very careful physical observations with a mathematical rigor. We prove\nthat the proposed numerical scheme can preserve the discrete (free) energy\ndissipation. Numerical tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n", "  The error scaling for Markov-Chain Monte Carlo techniques (MCMC) with $N$\nsamples behaves like $1/\\sqrt{N}$. This scaling makes it often very time\nintensive to reduce the error of computed observables, in particular for\napplications in lattice QCD. It is therefore highly desirable to have\nalternative methods at hand which show an improved error scaling. One candidate\nfor such an alternative integration technique is the method of recursive\nnumerical integration (RNI). The basic idea of this method is to use an\nefficient low-dimensional quadrature rule (usually of Gaussian type) and apply\nit iteratively to integrate over high-dimensional observables and Boltzmann\nweights. We present the application of such an algorithm to the topological\nrotor and the anharmonic oscillator and compare the error scaling to MCMC\nresults. In particular, we demonstrate that the RNI technique shows an error\nscaling in the number of integration points $m$ that is at least exponential.\n", "  Application of Parker's dynamo model to the geodynamo with the growing inner\ncore is considered. It is shown that decrease of the inner core size, where\nintensive magnetic field generation takes place, leads to the multi-polar\nmagnetic field in the past. This effect reflects the decrease of the region of\nthe effective magnetic field generation. The process is accompanied by increase\nof the reversals number and decrease of intensity of the geomagnetic field. The\nconstraints on the mechanisms of convection in the liquid core are discussed.\n", "  Foreshock events provide valuable insight to predict imminent major\nearthquakes. However, it is difficult to identify them in real time. In this\npaper, I propose an algorithm based on deep learning to instantaneously\nclassify a seismic waveform as a foreshock, mainshock or an aftershock event\nachieving a high accuracy of 99% in classification. As a result, this is by far\nthe most reliable method to predict major earthquakes that are preceded by\nforeshocks. In addition, I discuss methods to create an earthquake dataset that\nis compatible with deep networks.\n", "  The Orbital-Motion-Limited (OML) theory has been modified to predict the dust\ncharge and the results were contrasted with the Whipple approximation [Tang and\nDelzanno, Phys. Plasmas 21, 123708 (2014)]. To further establish its regime of\napplicability, in this paper the OML predictions (for a non-electron-emitting,\nspherical dust grain at rest in a collisionless, unmagnetized plasma) are\ncompared with Particle-In-Cell simulations that retain the absorption radius\neffect. It is found that for large dust grain radius $r_d$ relative to the\nplasma Debye length $\\lambda_D$, the revised OML theory remains a very good\napproximation as, for the parameters considered ($r_d/\\lambda_D\\le10$, equal\nelectron and ion temperatures), it yields the dust charge to within $20\\%$\naccuracy. This is a substantial improvement over the Whipple approximation. The\ndust collected currents and energy fluxes, which remain the same in the revised\nand standard OML theories, are accurate to within $15-30\\%$.\n", "  We report our recent lattice calculation of hadronic light-by-light\ncontribution to muon $g-2$ using our recently developed moment method. The\nconnected diagrams and the leading disconnected diagrams are included. The\ncalculation is performed on a $48^3 \\times 96$ lattice with physical pion mass\nand 5.5 fm box size. We expect sizable finite volume and finite lattice spacing\ncorrections to the results of these calculations which will be estimated in\ncalculations to be carried out over the next 1-2 years.\n", "  One-parameter families of exact two-component solitary-wave solutions for\ninteracting high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) waves are found in the\nframework of Zakharov-type models, which couple the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (NLSE) for intense HF waves to the Boussinesq (Bq) or Korteweg - de\nVries (KdV) equation for the LF component through quadratic terms. The systems\napply, in particular, to the interaction of surface (HF) and internal (LF)\nwaves in stratified fluids. These solutions are two-component generalizations\nof the single-component Bq and KdV solitons. Perturbed dynamics and stability\nof the solitary waves are studied in detail by means of analytical and\nnumerical methods. Essentially, they are stable against separation of the HF\nand LF components if the latter one is shaped as a potential well acting on the\nHF field, and unstable, against splitting of the two components, with a\nbarrier-shaped LF one. Collisions between the solitary waves are studied by\nmeans of direct simulations, demonstrating a trend to merger of in-phase\nsolitons, and elastic interactions of out-of-phase ones.\n", "  Hybrid entangled states, having entanglement between different\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF) of a particle pair, are of great interest for quantum\ninformation science and communication protocols. Among different DoFs, the\nhybrid entangled states encoded with polarization and orbital angular momentum\n(OAM) allow the generation of qubit-qudit entangled states, macroscopic\nentanglement with very high quanta of OAM and improvement in angular resolution\nin remote sensing. Till date, such hybrid entangled states are generated by\nusing a high-fidelity polarization entangled state and subsequent imprinting of\nchosen amount of OAM using suitable mode converters such as spatial light\nmodulator in complicated experimental schemes. Given that the entangled sources\nhave feeble number of photons, loss of photons during imprinting of OAM using\ndiffractive optical elements limits the use of such hybrid state for practical\napplications. Here we report, on a simple experimental scheme to generate\nhybrid entangled state in polarization and OAM through direct transfer of\nclassical non-separable state of the pump beam in parametric down conversion\nprocess. As a proof of principle, using local non-separable pump state of OAM\nmode l=3, we have produced quantum hybrid entangled state with entanglement\nwitness parameter of W-1.25 violating by 8 standard deviation. The generic\nscheme can be used to produce hybrid entangled state between two photons\ndiffering by any quantum number through proper choice of non-separable state of\nthe pump beam.\n", "  We studied waves seen during the class C1.9 flare that occurred in Active\nRegion NOAA 11272 on SOL2011-08-17. We found standing waves with periods in the\n9- and 19-minute band in six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths of the\nSDO/AIA instrument. We succeeded in identifying the magnetic arc where the\nflare started and two neighbour loops that were disturbed in sequence. The\nanalysed standing waves spatially coincide with these observed EUV loops. To\nstudy the wave characteristics along the loops, we extrapolated field lines\nfrom the line-of-sight magnetograms using the force-free approximation in the\nlinear regime. We used atmosphere models to determine the mass density and\ntemperature at each height of the loop. Then, we calculated the sound and\nAlfv{\\'e}n speeds using densities $10^8 \\lesssim n_i \\lesssim 10^{17}$\ncm$^{-3}$ and temperatures $10^3 \\lesssim T \\lesssim 10^7$ K. The brightness\nasymmetry in the observed standing waves resembles the Alfv{\\'e}n speed\ndistribution along the loops, but the atmospheric model we used needs higher\ndensities to explain the observed periods.\n", "  The topic of magnetic field diagnostics with the Zeeman effect is currently\nvividly discussed. There are some testable inversion codes available to the\nspectropolarimetry community and their application allowed for a better\nunderstanding of the magnetism of the solar atmosphere. In this context, we\npropose an inversion technique associated with a new numerical code. The\ninversion procedure is promising and particularly successful for interpreting\nthe Stokes profiles in quick and sufficiently precise way. In our inversion, we\nfit a part of each Stokes profile around a target wavelength, and then\ndetermine the magnetic field as a function of the wavelength which is\nequivalent to get the magnetic field as a function of the height of line\nformation.\n  To test the performance of the new numerical code, we employed \"hare and\nhound\" approach by comparing an exact solution (called input) with the solution\nobtained by the code (called output). The precision of the code is also checked\nby comparing our results to the ones obtained with the HAO MERLIN code. The\ninversion code has been applied to synthetic Stokes profiles of the Na D$_{1}$\nline available in the literature. We investigated the limitations in recovering\nthe input field in case of noisy data. As an application, we applied our\ninversion code to the polarization profiles of the Fe {\\sc i} $\\lambda$ 6302.5\n\\AA\\ observed at IRSOL in Locarno.\n", "  We discuss the reformulation of the O(2) model with a chemical potential and\nthe Abelian Higgs model on a 1+1 dimensional space-time lattice using the\nTensor Renormalization Group (TRG) method. The TRG allows exact blocking and\nconnects smoothly the classical Lagrangian approach to the quantum Hamiltonian\napproach. We calculate the entanglement entropy in the superfluid phase of the\nO(2) model and show that it approximately obeys the logarithmic Calabrese-Cardy\nscaling obtained from Conformal Field Theory (CFT). We calculate the Polyakov\nloop in the Abelian Higgs model and discuss the possibility of a deconfinement\ntransition at finite volume. We propose Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians implementable\non optical lattices as quantum simulators for CFT models.\n", "  We present ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements on Fe thin films where\nthe resonance condition is fulfilled in meta-stable magnetic states in\nsaturation. By comparison to spin wave theory calculations, we show that a\nsmall deviation in the shape of the free energy surfaces between the point at\nwhich the metastable state is expected to disappear and the one at which it\nactually decays in the measurement is accounted for by the thermal energy of\nthe magnonic and lattice system, namely the thermal fluctuation field. By\ncomparison to the expected magnon heat capacity, we show that this finding\noffers the possibility to measure the magnonic contribution to the heat\ncapacity by FMR independent of other contributions.\n", "  Bayesian techniques are widely used to obtain spectral functions from\ncorrelators. We suggest a technique to rid the results of nuisance parameters,\nie, parameters which are needed for the regularization but cannot be determined\nfrom data. We give examples where the method works, including a pion mass\nextraction with two flavours of staggered quarks at a lattice spacing of about\n0.07 fm. We also give an example where the method does not work.\n", "  The aim of the chapter is to summarize our understanding of the compositional\ndistribution across the different reservoirs of small bodies (main belt\nasteroids, giant planet trojans, irregular satellites of the giant planets,\nTNOs, comets). We then use this information to i) discuss current dynamical\nmodels (Nice and Grand Tack models), ii) mention possible caveats in these\nmodels if any, and iii) draw a preliminary version of the primordial\ncompositional gradient across the solar system before planetary migrations\noccured. Note that the composition of both planetary satellites (the regular\nones) and that of the transient populations (NEOs, centaurs) is not discussed\nhere. We strictly focus on the composition of the main reservoirs of small\nbodies. The manuscript's objective is to provide a global and synthetic view of\nsmall bodies' compositions rather than a very detailed one, for specific\nreviews regarding the composition of small bodies, see papers by Burbine (2014)\nfor asteroids, Emery et al. (2015) for Jupiter trojans, Mumma and Charnley\n(2011) for comets, and Brown (2012) for KBOs.\n", "  The generic problem of extracting information on intrinsic particle\nproperties from the whole class of interacting magnetic fine particle systems\nis a long standing and difficult inverse problem. As an example, the Switching\nField Distribution (SFD) is an important quantity in the characterization of\nmagnetic systems, and its determination in many technological applications,\nsuch as recording media, is especially challenging. Techniques such as the\nfirst order reversal curve (FORC) methods, were developed to extract the SFD\nfrom macroscopic measurements. However, all methods rely on separating the\ncontributions to the measurements of the intrinsic SFD and the extrinsic\neffects of magnetostatic and exchange interactions. We investigate the\nunderlying physics of the FORC method by applying it to the output predictions\nof a kinetic Monte-Carlo model with known input parameters. We show that the\nFORC method is valid only in cases of weak spatial correlation of the\nmagnetization and suggest a more general approach.\n", "  The gain in a plane wiggler with inhomogeneous magnetic field is calculated..\nIt is shown, that the account of inhomogenity of the magnetic field leads to\nappearance of additional peaks in the amplification\n", "  Low dimensional material systems provide a unique set of properties useful\nfor solid-state devices. The building block of these devices is the PN\njunction. In this work, we present a dramatic difference in the electrostatics\nof PN junctions in lower dimensional systems, as against the well understood\nthree dimensional systems. Reducing the dimensionality increases the fringing\nfields and depletion width significantly. We propose a novel method to derive\nanalytic equations in 2D and 1D that considers the impact of neutral regions.\nThe analytical results show an excellent match with both the experimental\nmeasurements and numerical simulations. The square root dependence of the\ndepletion width on the ratio of dielectric constant and doping in 3D changes to\na linear and exponential dependence for 2D and 1D respectively. This higher\nsensitivity of 1D PN junctions to its control parameters can be used towards\nnew sensors.\n", "  We calculate the photon emission rate and the electrical conductivity of the\nQGP at finite temperature and finite chemical potential using AdS/QCD\napproximations in an AdS Reissner Nordstrom background. To do so, we supposed\nthe medium properties to be encoded in a geometric background. The results\nobtained in the hard wall and soft wall model are consistent with the observed\nphenomenology and they also in agree with other holographic results, as the\nD3/D7 or the Sakai Sugimoto models, suggesting the universality of AdS/CFT\nconjecture as tool to explore QCD.\n", "  We report some approximate analytic form of meson wave function constructed\nupon solving Schrodinger equation with linear plus Coulomb type Cornell\npotential. With this wave function, we study Isgur-Wise function and its\nderivatives for heavy-light mesons in the infinite heavy quark mass limit. We\nalso explore the elastic form factors, charge radii and decay constants of\npseudoscalar mesons in this QCD inspired quark model approach.\n", "  Quantifying spontaneous, fugitive and venting related methane emissions are\noften difficult and cumbersome. However, auditing the methane emissions due to\nconventional and un-conventional hydrocarbon exploitation techniques are\nbecoming necessary. Present generation compact chemical sensors are slower,\ndegrade very fast, and are sensitive broad-spectrum gases. On the other hand,\noptical sensors are very fast in detection of gases and more precise and can be\neasily employed in various environments like boreholes and soils. In this\nstudy, we report development of an optical sensor that is methane specific,\nfast for real time applications and has tremendous application potential in the\nexploration of coal bed methane and other hydrocarbon reserves with methane as\na major constituent. The detection process is based on the principle of\nspectroscopic absorption of light. The detector, NiSi Schottky diode, was\nfabricated and characterized exclusively for the 1.65 um, narrow bandwidth\nmethane absorption. The probe is of 20 cm length and comprises of a laser\nsource and the NiSi detector aligned optically. This probe can be employed in\nboreholes, mine vents and soil layers for measuring real-time fluxes in methane\nconcentrations. From the laboratory based experiments it is observed that the\ndetection limits of the developed device is very low (3% by volume) and the\nresponse time of detection is very rapid (about 2 seconds). Based on the\nmaterials used, fabrication procedures adopted, sensitivity of the device and\nits compactness, the developed sensor can be considered as a novel, economic\ndevice for exploration of coal bed methane.\n", "  Multipacting is seen as a performance limiting phenomenon for the\nsuperconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Numerical simulations are\nessential to pre-empt the experimentally observed multipacting conditions.\nReadily available codes(e.g. FISHPACT, MULTIPACT,CST etc.) are widely used to\nsimulate the phenomenon of multipacting in such cases. Most of the contemporary\ntwo dimensional (2D) codes are unable to detect multipacting in the elliptical\ncavities because they use a simplistic secondary emission model, where a\nconstant value of emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons is assumed.\nSome three-dimensional (3D) codes, which use a more realistic and sophisticated\nsecondary emission model (Furman model) by following a probability distribution\nfor the emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons, are able to correctly\npredict the occurance of multipacting. These 3D softwares however require large\ndata handling and are slower than contemporary 2D codes. We have developed a 2D\ncode for the multipacting analysis for axisymmetric structures, which is based\non the Furman model. Since our code is 2D, it is faster than the 3D codes. This\nmakes it possible to perform an accurate multipacting analysis of multipacting\nwithin a resaonalble computational time, thus achieving an accuracy as good as\nin the case of 3D codes, but requiring significantly less computing time. We\nhave used our code for determining the multipacting prone range of values for\nEacc in beta_g =0.61 and beta_g =0.9, 650 MHz mid-cell elliptical cavities that\nwe have recently designed for the medium and high energy section of the\nproposed Indian Spallation Neutron Source (ISNS) project.\n", "  This dissertation investigates relative entropies, also called generalized\ndivergences, and how they can be used to characterize information-theoretic\ntasks in quantum information theory. The main goal is to further refine\ncharacterizations of the optimal rates for quantum source coding, state\nredistribution, and measurement compression with quantum side information via\nsecond order asymptotic expansions and strong converse theorems. The\ndissertation consists of a mathematical and an information-theoretic part. In\nthe mathematical part, we focus on the $\\alpha$-sandwiched R\\'enyi divergence\n($\\alpha$-SRD). We first investigate the limit $\\alpha\\to 0$ to determine\nwhether this recovers the well-known $0$-R\\'enyi relative divergence. We then\nprove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the\n$\\alpha$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the\nfidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and\nsufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality\n(viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the $\\alpha$-SRD, and give\napplications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first\nderive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a\nmixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source\ncodes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a\ncorollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum\nsource coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse\ntheorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement\ncompression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these\ntheorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on R\\'enyi entropic quantities\nderived from the $\\alpha$-SRD.\n", "  The motion of a compact body in space and time is commonly described by the\nworld line of a point representing the instantaneous position of the body. In\nGeneral Relativity such a world-line formalism is not quite straightforward\nbecause of the strict impossibility to accommodate point masses and rigid\nbodies. In many situations of practical interest it can still be made to work\nusing an effective hamiltonian or energy-momentum tensor for a finite number of\ncollective degrees of freedom of the compact object. Even so exact solutions of\nthe equations of motion are often not available. In such cases families of\nworld lines of compact bodies in curved space-times can be constructed by a\nperturbative procedure based on generalized geodesic deviation equations.\nExamples for simple test masses and for spinning test bodies are presented.\n", "  The paper describes the design of broadband excitation pulses in high\nresolution NMR by method of double sweep. We first show the design of a pulse\nsequence that produces broadband excitation to the equator of Bloch sphere with\nphase linearly dispersed as frequency. We show how this linear dispersion can\nthen be refocused by nesting free evolution between two adiabatic inversions\n(sweeps). We then show how this construction can be generalized to exciting\narbitrary large bandwidths without increasing the peak rf-amplitude and by\nincorporating more adiabatic sweeps. Finally, we show how the basic design can\nthen be modified to give a broadband $x$ rotation over arbitrary large\nbandwidth and with limited rf-amplitude. Experimental excitation profiles for\nthe residual HDO signal in a sample of $99.5\\%$ D$_2$0 are displayed as a\nfunction of resonance offset. Application of the excitation is shown for\n$^{13}$C excitation in a labelled sample of Alanine.\n", "  The dynamics of interstitial dopants governs the properties of a wide variety\nof doped crystalline materials. To describe the hopping dynamics of such\ninterstitial impurities, classical approaches often assume that dopant\nparticles do not interact and travel through a static potential energy\nlandscape. Here we show, using computer simulations, how these assumptions and\nthe resulting predictions from classical Eyring-type theories break down in\nentropically-stabilised BCC crystals due to the thermal excitations of the\ncrystalline matrix. Deviations are particularly severe close to melting where\nthe lattice becomes weak and dopant dynamics exhibit strongly localised and\nheterogeneous dynamics. We attribute these anomalies to the failure of both\nassumptions underlying the classical description: i) the instantaneous\npotential field experienced by dopants becomes largely disordered due to\nthermal fluctuations and ii) elastic interactions cause strong dopant-dopant\ninteractions even at low doping fractions. These results illustrate how\ndescribing non-classical dopant dynamics requires taking the effective\ndisordered potential energy landscape of strongly excited crystals and\ndopant-dopant interactions into account.\n", "  In recent years, a number of studies have introduced methods for identifying\npapers with delayed recognition (so called \"sleeping beauties\", SBs) or have\npresented single publications as cases of SBs. Most recently, Ke et al. (2015)\nproposed the so called \"beauty coefficient\" (denoted as B) to quantify how much\na given paper can be considered as a paper with delayed recognition. In this\nstudy, the new term \"smart girl\" (SG) is suggested to differentiate instant\ncredit or \"flashes in the pan\" from SBs. While SG and SB are qualitatively\ndefined, the dynamic citation angle \\b{eta} is introduced in this study as a\nsimple way for identifying SGs and SBs quantitatively - complementing the\nbeauty coefficient B. The citation angles for all articles from 1980 (n=166870)\nin natural sciences are calculated for identifying SGs and SBs and their\nextent. We reveal that about 3% of the articles are typical SGs and about 0.1%\ntypical SBs. The potential advantages of the citation angle approach are\nexplained.\n", "  We suggest the nondestructive method for determination of the dielectric\nconstant of substrate-deposited thin films by capacitance measurement with two\nparallel wires placed on top of the film. The exact analytical formula for the\ncapacitance of such system is derived. The functional dependence of the\ncapacitance on dielectric constants of the film, substrate, and environment\nmedia and on the distance between the wires permits to measure the dielectric\nconstant of thin films for the vast set of parameters where previously proposed\napproximate methods are less efficient.\n", "  We consider a class of stochastic models for energy transport and study\nrelations between the thermal conductivity and some static observables, such as\nthe static conductivity, which is defined as the contribution of static\ncorrelations in Green-Kubo formula. The class of models is a generalization of\ntwo specific models derived by Gaspard and Gilbert as mesoscopic dynamics of\nenergies for two-dimensional and three-dimensional locally confined hard-discs.\nThey claim some equalities hold between the thermal conductivity and several\nstatic observables and also conjecture that these equations are universal in\nthe sense that they hold for mesoscopic dynamics of energies for confined\nparticles interacting through hard-core collisions. In this paper, we give\nsufficient and necessary conditions for these equalities to hold in the class\nwe introduce. In particular, we prove that the equality between the thermal\nconductivity and other static observables holds if and only if the model obeys\nthe gradient condition. Since the gradient condition does not hold for models\nderived by Gaspard and Gilbert, our result implies a part of their claim is\nincorrect.\n", "  The origin of the anomalously compliant behavior of nanoporous gold is\nstudied by comparing the elasticity obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) and\nfinite element method (FEM) simulations. Both models yield a compliance, which\nis much higher than the predictions of the Gibson-Ashby scaling relation for\nmetal foams and thus confirm the influence of other microstructural features\nbesides the porosity. The linear elastic FEM simulation also yields a\nsubstantially stiffer response than the MD simulation, which reveals that\nnonlinear elastic behavior contributes decisively to the anomalous compliance\nof nanoporous gold at small structure size.\n", "  Transport properties of highly mobile 2D electrons are studied in symmetric\nGaAs quantum wells placed in titled magnetic fields. Quantum positive\nmagnetoresistance (QPMR) is observed in magnetic fields perpendicular to the 2D\nlayer. Application of in-plane magnetic field produces a dramatic decrease of\nthe QPMR. This decrease correlates strongly with the reduction of the amplitude\nof Shubnikov de Haas resistance oscillations due to modification of the\nelectron spectrum via enhanced Zeeman splitting. Surprisingly no quantization\nof the spectrum is detected when the Zeeman energy exceeds the half of the\ncyclotron energy suggesting an abrupt transformation of the electron dynamics.\nObserved angular evolution of QPMR implies strong mixing between spin subbands.\nTheoretical estimations indicate that in the presence of spin-orbital\ninteraction the elastic impurity scattering provides significant contribution\nto the spin mixing in GaAs quantum wells at high filling factors.\n", "  Studies of \\textit{BATSE} bursts \\citep{kouveliotou:93} have resulted in the\nwidespread adoption of a two-group categorization: long bursts (those with\ndurations $\\geq 2$ seconds) and short bursts (those with durations $\\leq 2$\nseconds). This categorization, one must recall, used the observed $T_{90}$ time\ndurations for bursts (during which 90\\% of a burst's fluence is measured). In\nthis work, we have explored two ideas: 1) a statistical search for a possible\nthird, intermediate category of bursts (between the \"short\" and the \"long\"\nones) among 2041 \\textit{BATSE} GRBs and 757 \\textit{Swift/BAT} ones, 2) a\nstudy of bursts' intrinsic durations, where durations in the bursts' reference\nframes (instead of the observed durations) are considered, for this, 248\n\\textit{Swift/BAT} bursts that have redshift measurements were statistically\nanalyzed for the same categorization goal.\n  We first use a Monte Carlo method to determine the proper binning of each\nGRB, considering that bursts come with different uncertainties on their\ndurations. Then, using the method of minimization of chi-square $\\chi^2$, we\nsearch for the best fit of the normalized frequency distributions\n$\\frac{1}{N_0}\\frac{dN}{d\\ln{T}}$ of durations, this allows us to compare fits\nwith two groups (\"short\" and \"long\") with fits with three groups (\"short\",\n\"long\", and \"intermediate\"). Our results indicate that the distributions of\nobserved durations are better fitted by three groups than two groups for\n\\textit{Swift/BAT} data, interestingly, the \"intermediate\" group appears rather\nclearly for both observed and intrinsic durations. For BATSE data, the\nstatistical test does not prefer three groups over two. We discuss the results,\ntheir possible underlying causes, and reasonable interpretations.\n", "  Geometric phase analysis has been applied to high resolution aberration\ncorrected (scanning) transmission electron microscopy images of InAs/GaAs\nquantum dot (QD) materials. We show quantitatively how the lattice mismatch\ninduced strain varies on the atomic scale and tetragonally distorts the lattice\nin a wide region that extends several nanometers into the GaAs spacer layer\nbelow and above the QDs. Finally, we show how V-shaped dislocations originating\nat the QD/GaAs interface efficiently remove most of the lattice mismatch\ninduced tetragonal distortions in and around the QD.\n", "  Urbanization is one of the extreme process that increases uncertainty in\nfuture climate projections. Flow regimes of mesoscale circulations associated\nwith surface heating due to urbanization have been investigated using a wavelet\nbased computational fluid dynamics~(CFD) model. The results of our numerical\nmodel have been validated against that of a laboratory model, as well as\nreference numerical simulations. Characteristics of urban induced circulations\nhave been studied for surface heat flux perturbation ($H_0$) between\n$28.93$Wm$^{-2}$ and $925.92$Wm$^{-2}$, and the results have been analyzed\nagainst available boundary layer measurements under similar physical\nconditions. Our primary study shows that urban/rural heat flux anomalies\nintroduce strong oscillations in the convective boundary layer (CBL), and\ntransfers a fraction of the turbulent kinetic energy vertically through\ninternal waves. Such results complement previous investigators' hypothesis that\ntemporal oscillations in urban-induced mesoscale circulations are primarily due\nto a downscale energy cascade. Although a further detailed study is necessary,\nthe present numerical observations provide useful feedback for the impacts of\nurbanization on regional climate.\n", "  The complete Swift Burst Alert Telescope and X-Ray Telescope light curves of\n118 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with known redshifts were fitted using the physical\nmodel of GRB pulses by Willingale et al. to produce a total of 607 pulses. We\ncompute the pulse luminosity function utilizing three GRB formation rate\nmodels: a progenitor that traces the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD)\nwith either a single population of GRBs, coupled to various evolutionary\nparameters, or a bimodal population of high- and low-luminosity GRBs, and a\ndirect fit to the GRB formation rate excluding any a priori assumptions. We\nfind that a single population of GRB pulses with an evolving luminosity\nfunction is preferred over all other univariate evolving GRB models, or bimodal\nluminosity functions in reproducing the observed GRB pulse L-z distribution and\nthat the magnitude of the evolution in brightness is consistent with studies\nthat utilize only the brightest GRB pulses. We determine that the appearance of\na GRB formation rate density evolution component is an artifact of poor\nparametrization of the CSFRD at high redshifts rather than indicating evolution\nin the formation rate of early epoch GRBs. We conclude that the single\nbrightest region of a GRB light curve holds no special property, by\nincorporating pulse data from the totality of GRB emission we boost the GRB\npopulation statistics by a factor of 5, rule out some models utilized to\nexplain deficiencies in GRB formation rate modelling, and constrain more\ntightly some of the observed parameters of GRB behaviour.\n", "  Epitaxial graphene grown on SiC by the confinement controlled sublimation\nmethod is reviewed, with an emphasis on multilayer and monolayer epitaxial\ngraphene on the carbon face of 4H-SiC and on directed and selectively grown\nstructures under growth-arresting or growth-enhancing masks. Recent\ndevelopments in the growth of templated graphene nanostructures are also\npresented, as exemplified by tens of micron long very well confined and\nisolated 20-40nm wide graphene ribbons. Scheme for large scale integration of\nribbon arrays with Si wafer is also presented.\n", "  Groundwater and rock are intensively exploited in the world. When a quarry is\ndeepened the water table of the exploited geological formation might be\nreached. A dewatering system is therefore installed so that the quarry\nactivities can continue, possibly impacting the nearby water catchments. In\norder to recommend an adequate feasibility study before deepening a quarry, we\npropose two interaction indices between extractive activity and groundwater\nresources based on hazard and vulnerability parameters used in the assessment\nof natural hazards. The levels of each index (low, medium, high, very high)\ncorrespond to the potential impact of the quarry on the regional hydrogeology.\n  The first index is based on a discrete choice modelling methodology while the\nsecond is relying on an artificial neural network. It is shown that these two\ncomplementary approaches (the former being probabilistic while the latter fully\ndeterministic) are able to predict accurately the level of interaction. Their\nuse is finally illustrated by their application on the Boverie quarry and the\nTridaine gallery located in Belgium. The indices determine the current\ninteraction level as well as the one resulting from future quarry extensions.\nThe results highlight the very high interaction level of the quarry with the\ngallery.\n", "  In nature, a variety of limbless locomotion patterns flourish from the small\nor basic life form (Escherichia coli, the amoeba, etc.) to the large or\nintelligent creatures (e.g., slugs, starfishes, earthworms, octopuses,\njellyfishes, and snakes). Many bioinspired soft robots based on locomotion have\nbeen developed in the past decades. In this work, based on the kinematics and\ndynamics of two representative locomotion modes (i.e., worm-like crawling and\nsnake-like slithering), we propose a broad set of innovative designs for soft\nmobile robots through simple mechanical principles. Inspired by and go beyond\nexisting biological systems, these designs include 1-D (dimensional), 2-D, and\n3-D robotic locomotion patterns enabled by simple actuation of continuous\nbeams. We report herein over 20 locomotion modes achieving various locomotion\nfunctions, including crawling, rising, running, creeping, squirming,\nslithering, swimming, jumping, turning, turning over, helix rolling, wheeling,\netc. Some of them are able to reach high speed, high efficiency, and overcome\nobstacles. All these locomotion strategies and functions can be integrated into\na simple beam model. The proposed simple and robust models are adaptive for\nsevere and complex environments. These elegant designs for diverse robotic\nlocomotion patterns are expected to underpin future deployments of soft robots\nand to inspire series of advanced designs.\n", "  Ba$_3$Mn$_2$O$_8$ is a geometrically frustrated spin dimer compound. We\ninvestigate the effect of site disorder on the zero field phase diagram of this\nmaterial by considering the solid solution\nBa$_{3}$(Mn$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{8}$, where nonmagnetic V$^{5+}$ ions\npartially substitute magnetic Mn$^{5+}$ ions. This substitution results in\nunpaired $S=1$ moments for half-substituted dimers, which are ungapped and\ntherefore susceptible to types of magnetic order not present in the parent\ncompound. AC susceptibility measurements of compositions between $x=0.046$ and\n$x=0.84$ show a sharp frequency- and composition-dependent kink at temperatures\nbelow 210mK, suggesting that unpaired spins form a spin glass. The case for a\nglassy state is made clearer by the absence of any sharp features in the\nspecific heat. However, Ba$_{3}$(Mn$_{1-x}$V$_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is not a\nparadigmatic spin glass. Whereas both the freezing temperature and the Weiss\ntemperature (determined from susceptibility above 1K) vary strongly as a\nfunction of composition, the heat capacity per unpaired spin is found to be\ninsensitive (above the glass transition) to the density of unpaired spins for\nthe broad regime $0.18\\leq x \\leq 0.84$. This surprising result is consistent\nwith a scenario in which nearest-neighbor unpaired spins form local, possibly\nfluctuating, spin-singlets prior to the eventual spin freezing. The spin glass\nstate is only found for temperatures below the energy scale of single-ion\nanisotropy, suggestive this plays a significant role in determining the\neventual ground state. Possible ground states in the \"dilute\" limit ($x < 0.04$\nand $x > 0.9$) are also discussed.\n", "  This paper is based on my presentation at RIMS workshop on \"Theory of\nIntegrable Systems and Its Applications in Various Fields\" held in Kyoto on\n19--21, August 2015. The aim of the present paper is to give a short account of\nrecent studies on relations between conformal blocks in the two-dimensional\nconformal field theory and Painlev\\'e functions. In addition, we present a\nconjecture on a combinatorial expansion formula of the three-point irregular\nconformal block at an irregular singular point, with two regular singular\npoints and one irregular singular point. Our conjectural expansion formula is\nwritten in terms of pairs of skew Young diagrams, while the four-point regular\nconformal block, by AGT correspondence, is written in terms of pairs of Young\ndiagrams.\n", "  We explore the critical behavior of (n+1)-dimensional topological\nBorn-Infeld-dilaton black holes in an extended phase space. We treat the\ncosmological constant and the Born-Infeld (BI) parameter as the thermodynamic\npressure and BI vacuum polarization which can vary. We obtain thermodynamic\nquantities of the system such as pressure, temperature, Gibbs free energy, and\ninvestigate the behaviour of these quantities. We also study the analogy of the\nvan der Waals liquid-gas system with the Born-Infeld-dilaton black holes in\ncanonical ensemble in which we can treat the black hole charge as a fixed\nexternal parameter. Moreover, we show that the critical values of pressure,\ntemperature and volume are physical provided the coupling constant of dilaton\ngravity is less than one and the horizon is sphere. Finally, we calculate the\ncritical xponents and show that although thermodynamic quantities depend on the\ndilaton oupling constant, BI parameter and the dimension of the spacetime, they\nare universal and are independent of metric parameters.\n", "  We study in some detail the \"extended Kerr-Schild\" formulation of general\nrelativity, which decomposes the gauge-independent degrees of freedom of a\ngeneric metric into two arbitrary functions and the choice of a flat background\ntetrad. We recast Einstein's equations and spacetime curvatures in the extended\nKerr-Schild form and discuss their properties, illustrated with simple\nexamples.\n", "  We theoretically study the Berry curvature of the magnon induced by the\nhybridization with the acoustic phonons via the spin-orbit and dipolar\ninteractions. We first discuss the magnon-phonon hybridization via the dipolar\ninteraction, and show that the dispersions have gapless points in momentum\nspace, some of which form a loop. Next, when both spin-orbit and dipolar\ninteractions are considered, we show anisotropic texture of the Berry curvature\nand its divergence with and without gap-closing. Realistic evaluation of the\nconsequent anomalous velocity is given for yttrium iron garnet.\n", "  Monolayer tinene presents rich absorption spectra in electric fields. There\nare three kinds of special structures, namely shoulders, logarithmically\nsymmetric peaks and asymmetric peaks in the square-root form, corresponding to\nthe optical excitations of the extreme points, saddle points and\nconstant-energy loops. With the increasing field strength, two splitting\nshoulder structures, which are dominated by the parabolic bands of ${5p_z}$\norbitals, come to exist because of the spin-split energy bands. The frequency\nof threshold shoulder declines to zero and then linearly grows. The third\nshoulder at ${0.75 \\sim 0.85}$ eV mainly comes from (${5p_x,5p_y}$) orbitals.\nThe former and the latter orbitals, respectively, create the saddle-point\nsymmetric peaks near the M point, while they hybridize with one another to\ngenerate the loop-related asymmetric peaks. Tinene quite differs from graphene,\nsilicene, and germanene. The special relationship among the multi-orbital\nchemical bondings, spin-orbital couplings and Coulomb potentials accounts for\nthe feature-rich optical properties.\n", "  In this work we investigate broad band (1-79 keV) spectral nature of the\natoll source 4U 1636-536 using the combined Nu-STAR and SWIFT-XRT data. The\nspectra are complex and have emission components from the disc, boundary-layer\nand corona. In addition to that a broad iron line is also observed. A\nrelativistic line model assuming Schwarzchild metric fits this feature. The\ntotal flux varies from 1.4 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$ to 4.36 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$\n$ergs/s/cm^2$. At the highest flux level the source was found in the soft\nstate. In this state the Comptonized component has temperature $kT_e \\sim 3$\nkeV and optical depth $\\tau \\sim $ 16. We also detect a non-thermal tail with\nindex $\\sim$ 2.4, contributing $\\sim$ 10 \\% of the total flux in the soft\nstate. We also find that the inner disc radius, electron temperature and\noptical depth vary with the total 0.1-100 keV unabsorbed flux. We discuss the\nimplication of the results in this paper.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the quantum spacetimes that are potentially\nconnected with the generalized uncertainty principles. By analyzing the\ngravity-induced quantum interference pattern and the Gedanken for weighting\nphoton, we find that the generalized uncertainty principles inspire the\neffective Newton constant as same as our previous proposal. A characteristic\nmomentum associated with the tidal effect is suggested, which incorporates the\nquantum effect with the geometric nature of gravity. When the simplest\ngeneralized uncertainty principle is considered, the minimal model of the\nregular black holes is reproduced by the effective Newton constant. The black\nhole's tunneling probability, accurate to the second order correction, is\ncarefully analyzed. We find that the tunneling probability is regularized by\nthe size of the black hole remnant. Moreover, the black hole remnant is the\nfinal state of a tunneling process that the probability is minimized. A theory\nof modified gravity is suggested, by substituting the effective Newton constant\ninto the Hilbert-Einstein action.\n", "  For studying how dynamical responses to external stimuli depend on the\nsynaptic-coupling type, we consider two types of excitatory and inhibitory\nsynchronization (i.e., synchronization via synaptic excitation and inhibition)\nin complex small-world networks of excitatory regular spiking (RS) pyramidal\nneurons and inhibitory fast spiking (FS) interneurons. For both cases of\nexcitatory and inhibitory synchronization, effects of synaptic couplings on\ndynamical responses to external time-periodic stimuli $S(t)$ (applied to a\nfraction of neurons) are investigated by varying the driving amplitude $A$ of\n$S(t)$. Stimulated neurons are phase-locked to external stimuli for both cases\nof excitatory and inhibitory couplings. On the other hand, the stimulation\neffect on non-stimulated neurons depends on the type of synaptic coupling. The\nexternal stimulus $S(t)$ makes a constructive effect on excitatory\nnon-stimulated RS neurons (i.e., it causes external phase lockings in the\nnon-stimulated sub-population), while $S(t)$ makes a destructive effect on\ninhibitory non-stimulated FS interneurons (i.e., it breaks up original\ninhibitory synchronization in the non-stimulated sub-population). As results of\nthese different effects of $S(t)$, the type and degree of dynamical response\n(e.g., synchronization enhancement or suppression), characterized by the\ndynamical response factor $D_f$ (given by the ratio of synchronization degree\nin the presence and absence of stimulus), are found to vary in a distinctly\ndifferent way, depending on the synaptic-coupling type. Furthermore, we also\nmeasure the matching degree between the dynamics of the two sub-populations of\nstimulated and non-stimulated neurons in terms of a \"cross-correlation\" measure\n$M_c$. With increasing $A$, based on $M_c$, we discuss the cross-correlations\nbetween the two sub-populations, affecting the dynamical responses to $S(t)$.\n", "  Using separable $\\bar{K}N-\\pi\\Sigma$ potentials in the Faddeev equations, we\ncalculated the binding energies and widths of the $K^{-}pp$, $K^{-}ppn$ and\n$K^{-}ppp$ quasi-bound states on the basis of three- and four-body\nAlt-Grassberger-Sandhas equations in the momentum representation. One- and\ntwo-pole version of $\\bar{K}N-\\pi\\Sigma$ interaction are considered and the\ndependence of the resulting few-body energy on the two-body\n$\\bar{K}N-\\pi\\Sigma$ potential was investigated. The $s$-wave [3+1] and [2+2]\nsub-amplitudes are obtained by using the Hilbert-Schmidt expansion procedure\nfor the integral kernels. As a result, we found a four-body resonance of the\n$K^{-}ppn$ and $K^{-}ppp$ quasi-bound states with a binding energy in the range\n$B_{K^{-}ppn}\\sim{55-70}$ and $B_{K^{-}ppp}\\sim{90-100}$ MeV, respectively. The\ncalculations yielded full width of $\\Gamma_{K^{-}ppn}\\sim{16-20}$ and\n$\\Gamma_{K^{-}ppp}\\sim{7-20}$ MeV.\n", "  We conclude our analysis of the linear response of charge transport in\nlattice systems of free fermions subjected to a random potential by deriving\ngeneral mathematical properties of its conductivity at the macroscopic scale.\nThe present paper belongs to a succession of studies on Ohm and Joule's laws\nfrom a thermodynamic viewpoint. We show, in particular, the existence and\nfiniteness of the conductivity measure $\\mu _{\\mathbf{\\Sigma }}$ for\nmacroscopic scales. Then we prove that, similar to the conductivity measure\nassociated to Drude's model, $\\mu _{\\mathbf{\\Sigma }}$ converges in the\nweak$^{\\ast } $-topology to the trivial measure in the case of perfect\ninsulators (strong disorder, complete localization), whereas in the limit of\nperfect conductors (absence of disorder) it converges to an atomic measure\nconcentrated at frequency $\\nu =0$. However, the AC--conductivity $\\mu\n_{\\mathbf{\\Sigma }}|_{\\mathbb{R}\\backslash \\{0\\}}$ does not vanish in general:\nWe show that $\\mu _{\\mathbf{\\Sigma }}(\\mathbb{R}\\backslash \\{0\\})>0$, at least\nfor large temperatures and a certain regime of small disorder.\n", "  We describe theoretically and validate experimentally the mechanism of\nformation of capillary bridges during pulling a beaded chain out from a liquid\nwith a planar surface. There are two types of capillary bridges present in this\nsystem, namely the sphere-planar liquid surface bridge initially formed between\nthe spherical bead leaving the liquid bath and the original bulk planar liquid\nsurface, and the sphere-sphere capillary bridge formed between neighbouring\nbeads in the part of the chain above the liquid surface. During pulling the\nchain out of the liquid, the sphere-planar liquid surface bridge transforms\ninto the sphere-sphere bridge. We show that for monodisperse spherical beads\ncomprising the chain, this morphological phase transition can be either\ncontinuous or discontinuous. The transition is continuous when the diameter of\nthe spherical beads is larger than the capillary length. Otherwise, the\ntransition is discontinuous, likewise the capillary force acting on the chain.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the contribution of the late time mode of a\nmassless vector field to the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational\nwave using retarded Green's propagator. We consider a non-trivial coupling\nbetween gravity and the vector field. We find that the correction is\nscale-invariant and of order $\\frac{H^4}{M_P^4}$. The non-minimal coupling\nleads to a dependence of $\\frac{H^2}{M^2}$, which can amplify the correlation\nfunction up to the level of $\\frac{H^2}{M^2_P}$.\n", "  We give a brief historical account on microscopic explanations of electrical\nconduction. One aim of this short review is to show that Thermodynamics is\nfundamental to the theoretical understanding of the phenomenon. We discuss how\nthe 2nd law, implemented in the scope of Quantum Statistical Mechanics, can be\nnaturally used to give mathematical sense to conductivity of very general\nquantum many-body models. This is reminiscent of original ideas of J.P. Joule.\nWe start with Ohm and Joule's discoveries and proceed by describing the Drude\nmodel of conductivity. The impact of Quantum Mechanics and the Anderson model\nare also discussed. The exposition is closed with the presentation of our\napproach to electrical conductivity based on the 2nd law of Thermodynamics as\npassivity of systems at thermal equilibrium. It led to new rigorous results on\nlinear conductivity of interacting fermions. One example is the existence of\nso-called AC-conductivity measures for such a physical system. These measures\nare, moreover, Fourier transforms of time correlations of current fluctuations\nin the system. I.e., the conductivity satisfies, for a large class of quantum\nmechanical microscopic models, Green-Kubo relations.\n", "  We introduce and analyze theoretically a procedure that combines slow\nadiabatic STIRAP manipulation with short nonadiabatic Rabi pulses to produce\nany desired three-level state in a qutrit system. In this protocol, the fast\npulses create superpositions between the ground state and the first excited\nstate, while the slow pulses transfer an arbitrary population to the second\nexcited state via stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP). We demonstrate\nhigh-fidelity quantum control of the level populations and phases and we\ncharacterize the errors incurred under the breakdown of adiabaticity. In a\nconfiguration where an ancillary state is available, we show how to realize a\nnondemolition monitoring of the relative phases. These methods are general and\ncan be implemented on any experimental platform where a quantum system with at\nleast three accessible energy levels is available. We discuss here in detail\nexperimental implementations in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) based on\nthe results obtained with a transmon, where the control of population using the\nhybrid Rabi-STIRAP sequence has been achieved.\n", "  Transition metal oxide heterostructures often, but by far not always, exhibit\nstrong electronic correlations. State-of-the-art calculations account for these\nby dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). We discuss the physical situations in\nwhich DMFT is needed, not needed, and where it is actually not sufficient. By\nmeans of an example, SrVO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$, we discuss step-by-step and\nfigure-by-figure a density functional theory(DFT)+DMFT calculation. The second\npart reviews DFT+DMFT calculations for oxide heterostructure focusing on\ntitanates, nickelates, vanadates, and ruthenates.\n", "  The quasiperiodic route to chaos in a piecewise linear forced parallel LCR\ncircuit with a negative conductance and diode is studied analytically. An\nexplicit analytical solution for the normalized state equations of the\npiecewise linear circuit is presented explaining the quasiperiodic route to\nchaos through phase portraits and power spectrum.\n", "  The study of dualities is a central issue in several modern approaches to\nquantum field theory, as they have broad consequences on the structure and on\nthe properties of the theory itself. We call Abelian duality the generalisation\nto arbitrary spacetime dimension of the duality between electric and magnetic\nfield in Maxwell theory. In the present thesis, in the framework of algebraic\nquantum field theory, the Abelian duality for quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetime with compact Cauchy surface is tackled. Fistly, the\nalgebra of observables is constructed. It is shown that it can be presented as\nthe direct sum of three pre-symplectic Abelian groups, each corresponding to a\ndifferent sector of the theory. As a consequence, it is possible to provide\nquantum states for the theory by building separate states on each direct\nsummand. In particular, explicit examples in two and four dimensions are\ndiscussed thoroughly; a ground Hadamard state in a suitable sense is proved to\nexist for both of them. Lastly, it is shown that the Abelian duality is\nimplemented by unitary operators at the level of the GNS Hilbert space.\n", "  This study investigates the effect of stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) on\nplanetary wave (PW) activity in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT). PW\nactivity near 95 km is derived from meteor wind data using a chain of eight\nSuperDARN radars at high northern latitudes that span longitudes from\n150$^{\\circ}$ W to 25$^{\\circ}$ E and latitudes from 51 to 66$^{\\circ}$ N.\nZonal wave number 1 and 2 components were extracted from the meridional wind\nfor the years 2000-2008. The observed wintertime PW activity shows common\nfeatures associated with the stratospheric wind reversals and the accompanying\nstratospheric warming events. Onset dates for seven SSW events accompanied by\nan elevated stratopause (ES) were identified during this time period using the\nSpecified Dynamics Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM). For the\nseven events, a significant enhancement in wave number 1 and 2 PW amplitudes\nnear 95 km was found to occur after the wind reversed at 50 km, with amplitudes\nmaximizing approximately 5 days after the onset of the wind reversal. This PW\nenhancement in the MLT after the event was confirmed using SD-WACCM. When all\ncases of polar cap wind reversals at 50 km were considered, a significant,\nalbeit moderate, correlation of 0.4 was found between PW amplitudes near 95 km\nand westward polar-cap stratospheric winds at 50 km, with the maximum\ncorrelation occurring $\\sim$ 3 days after the maximum westward wind. These\nresults indicate that the enhancement of PW amplitudes near 95 km is a common\nfeature of SSWs irrespective of the strength of the wind reversal.\n", "  The two-dimensional free-boundary problem describing steady gravity waves\nwith vorticity on water of finite depth is considered. Bounds for stream\nfunctions as well as free-surface profiles and the total head are obtained\nunder the assumption that the vorticity distribution is a locally Lipschitz\nfunction. It is also shown that wave flows have counter-currents in the case\nwhen the infimum of the free surface profile exceeds a certain critical value.\n", "  We derive a formula for the P\\'eclet number ($\\mathrm{Pe}$) by estimating the\nrelative strengths of various terms of the momentum equation. Using direct\nnumerical simulations in three dimensions we show that in the turbulent regime,\nthe fluid acceleration is dominated by the pressure gradient, with relatively\nsmall contributions arising from the buoyancy and the viscous term, in the\nviscous regime, acceleration is very small due to a balance between the\nbuoyancy and the viscous term. Our formula for $\\mathrm{Pe}$ describes the past\nexperiments and numerical data quite well. We also show that the ratio of the\nnonlinear term and the viscous term is $\\mathrm{Re} \\mathrm{Ra}^{-0.14}$, where\n$\\mathrm{Re}$ and $\\mathrm{Ra}$ are Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers respectively,\nand that the viscous dissipation rate $\\epsilon_u = (U^3/d)\n\\mathrm{Ra}^{-0.21}$, where $U$ is the root mean square velocity and $d$ is the\ndistance between the two horizontal plates. The aforementioned decrease in\nnonlinearity compared to free turbulence arises due to the wall effects.\n", "  In this paper we estimate the relative strengths of various terms of the\nRayleigh-B\\'enard equations. Based on these estimates and scaling analysis, we\nderive a general formula for the large-scale velocity, $U$, or the P\\'eclet\nnumber that is applicable for arbitrary Rayleigh number $\\mathrm{Ra}$ and\nPrandtl number $\\mathrm{Pr}$. Our formula fits reasonably well with the earlier\nsimulation and experimental results. Our analysis also shows that the\nwall-bounded convection has enhanced viscous force compared to free turbulence.\nWe also demonstrate how correlations deviate the Nusselt number scaling from\nthe theoretical prediction of $\\mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$ to the experimentally\nobserved scaling of nearly $\\mathrm{Ra}^{0.3}$.\n", "  We propose an ultradiscrete permanent solution to the ultradiscrete KP\nequation. The ultradiscrete permanent is an ultradiscrete analogue of the usual\npermanent. The elements on this ultradiscrete permanent solution are required\nsome additional relations other than the ultradiscrete dispersion relation. We\nconfirm the solution satisfying these relations and propose some explicit\nexamples of the solution.\n", "  We review the prospects of the Large Hadron Collider in accessing heavy\ncharged Higgs boson signals in $b\\bar b W^\\pm$ final states, wherein the\ncontributing channels can be $H^+\\to t\\bar b$, $hW^\\pm$, $HW^\\pm$ and $AW^\\pm$.\nIn particular, we devise a selection strategy which optimizes their global\nyield. We consider a 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II and we assume as production\nmode $bg\\to tH^-$ + c.c., the dominant one over the range $M_{H^\\pm}\\ge 480$\nGeV, as dictated by $b\\to s\\gamma$ constraints. Possibilities of detection are\nfound to be significant for various Run 2 energies and luminosities.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations revealed significant difference in deformation\nbehaviour of $<$100$>$ BCC Fe nanowires with and without twist boundary. The\nplastic deformation in perfect $<$100$>$ BCC Fe nanowire was dominated by\ntwinning and reorientation to $<$110$>$ followed by further deformation by slip\nmode. On the contrary, $<$100$>$ BCC Fe nanowire with a twist boundary deformed\nby slip at low plastic strains followed by twinning at high strains and absence\nof full reorientation. The results suggest that the deformation in $<$100$>$\nBCC Fe nanowire by dislocation slip is preferred over twinning in the presence\nof initial dislocations or dislocation networks. The results also explain the\nabsence of extensive twinning in bulk materials, which inherently contains\nlarge number of dislocations.\n", "  An overview of cross section measurements as a function of jet multiplicities\nand jet kinematics in association with $t\\bar{t}$ production is presented. Both\nthe ATLAS and the CMS collaborations performed a large number of measurements\nat different center-of-mass energies of the LHC using various $t\\bar{t}$ decay\nchannels. Theoretical predictions of these quantities usually rely on parton\nshower simulations that strongly depends on tunable parameters and come with\nlarge uncertainties. The measurements are compared to various theoretical\ndescriptions based on different combinations of matrix-element calculations and\nparton-shower models.\n", "  We consider chiral fluids within the standard framework of a chiral-invariant\nunderlying field theory, anomalous in presence of electromagnetic fields. Apart\nfrom the Noether axial current of the underlying theory, in the limit of ideal\nfluid there exist extra conserved currents, corresponding to classical helical\nmotions. The extra conservation laws are known to break down once viscosity is\nnon-vanishing. Which looks puzzling, as if introduction of viscosity were\ninconsistent with chiral invariance. As a resolution of the puzzle, we argue\nthat locally one can introduce an inertial frame where an extra conservation\nlaw still holds. In other words, the extra currents are covariantly conserved.\nThe emergent gravitational field is determined by dynamics of the viscous\nfluid. We turn then to instabilities of chiral plasma against decays into\nhelical magnetic or vortical configurations. We emphasise similarity between\nthe two cases in the far infrared region, responsible for the decays. This\nsimilarity is not apparent within the standard counting of orders in derivative\nexpansion. The material was originally prepared for a review talk by the\nauthor.\n", "  Strong coupling lattice QCD in the dual representation allows to study the\nfull $\\mu$-$T$ phase diagram, due to the mildness of the finite density sign\nproblem. Such simulations have been performed in the chiral limit, both at\nfinite $N_t$ and in the continuous time limit. Here we extend the phase diagram\nto finite quark masses, with an emphasis on the low temperature first order\ntransition. We present our results on the quark mass dependence of the critical\nend point and the first order line obtained by Monte Carlo via the worm\nalgorithm.\n", "  Coordination polymerization leads to various metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)\nin which symmetrical metal nodes exposed to nano voids lead to unique physical\nproperties and chemical functionalities. One of the challenges towards their\napplications as porous materials is to make MOFs optimally conductive to be\nused as electronic components. Here, we demonstrate that Co-MOF-74, a honeycomb\nnano{framework with one{dimensionally arranged cobalt atoms advances its\nphysical properties by accommodating Tetracyanochinodimethan (TCNQ), an\nacceptor molecule. Strong intermolecular charge transfer narrows the optical\nband gap down to 1.5 eV of divalent TCNQ and enhances the electrical\nconduction, which allows the MOF to be utilized for resistive gas- and\nphoto-sensing. Our result provides insight into electronic interactions in\ndoped MOFs and paves the way towards their electronic applications.\n", "  The latest ATLAS results for processes with a top quark pair and an\nassociated vector boson are presented here. The measurement of the production\ncross sections for these processes is important for the direct determination of\nthe top quark couplings to gauge bosons and for constraints on new physics\nmodels, in particular for models which go beyond the Standard Model regarding\nthe mechanism for the mass generation.\n", "  We study strong-field molecular ionization as a function of pulse duration.\nExperimental measurements of the photoelectron yield for a number of molecules\nreveal competition between different ionization continua (cationic states)\nwhich depends strongly on pulse duration. Surprisingly, in the limit of short\npulse duration, we find that a single ionic continuum dominates the yield,\nwhereas multiple continua are produced for longer pulses. Using calculations\nwhich take vibrational dynamics into account, we interpret our results in terms\nof nuclear motion and non-adiabatic dynamics during the ionization process.\n", "  We present results on the spin and quark content of the nucleon using $N_f=2$\ntwisted mass clover-improved fermion simulations with a pion mass close to its\nphysical value. We use recently developed methods to obtain accurate results\nfor both connected and disconnected contributions. We provide results for the\naxial charge, quark and gluon momentum fraction as well as the light, strange\nand charm $\\sigma$-terms.\n", "  We determine a fundamental upper bound on the performance of any adaptive\nprotocol for discrimination or estimation of a channel which has an unknown\nparameter encoded in the state of its environment. Since our approach relies on\nthe principle of data processing, the bound applies to a variety of\ndiscrimination measures, including quantum relative entropy, hypothesis testing\nrelative entropy, R\\'enyi relative entropy, fidelity, and quantum Fisher\ninformation. We apply the upper bound to thermal (amplifier) channels with a\nknown transmissivity (gain) but unknown excess noise. In these cases, we find\nthat the upper bounds are achievable for several discrimination measures of\ninterest, and the method for doing so is non-adaptive, employing a highly\nsqueezed two-mode vacuum state at the input of each channel use. Estimating the\nexcess noise of a thermal channel is of principal interest for the security of\nquantum key distribution, in the setting where a fiber-optic cable has a known\ntransmissivity but a tampering eavesdropper alters the excess noise on the\nchannel, so that estimating the excess noise as precisely as possible is\ndesirable. Finally, we outline a practical strategy which can be used to\nachieve these limits.\n", "  The \"generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations\", which had anticipated\nthe \"fluctuation theorems\" fifteen years before, are applied to presently\npopular \"information to useful work conversion\" to demonstrate that its success\nand bounds are determined by a specific \"insider\" information rather than\nformal one\n", "  We report on a measurement of the constancy and anisotropy of the speed of\nlight relative to the electrons in photon-electron scattering. We used the\nCompton scattering asymmetry measured by the new Compton polarimeter in Hall~C\nat Jefferson Lab to test for deviations from unity of the vacuum refractive\nindex ($n$). For photon energies in the range of 9 - 46 MeV, we obtain a new\nlimit of $1-n < 1.4 \\times 10^{-8}$. In addition, the absence of sidereal\nvariation over the six month period of the measurement constrains any\nanisotropies in the speed of light. These constitute the first study of Lorentz\ninvariance using Compton asymmetry. Within the minimal standard model extension\nframework, our result yield limits on the photon and electron coefficients\n$\\tilde{\\kappa}_{0^+}^{YZ}, c_{TX}, \\tilde{\\kappa}_{0^+}^{ZX}$, and $c_{TY}$.\nAlthough, these limits are several orders of magnitude larger than the current\nbest limits, they demonstrate the feasibility of using Compton asymmetry for\ntests of Lorentz invariance. Future parity violating electron scattering\nexperiments at Jefferson Lab will use higher energy electrons enabling better\nconstraints.\n", "  This thesis constitutes a first attempt to derive aspects of standard model\nparticle physics from little more than an algebra. Here, we argue that physical\nconcepts such as particles, causality, and irreversible time may result from\nthe algebra acting on itself. We then focus on a special case by considering\nthe algebra $\\mathbb{R}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\mathbb{H}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}$.\nUsing nothing more than\n$\\mathbb{R}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\mathbb{H}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}$ acting on\nitself, we set out to find standard model particle representations.\n  From the complex quaternionic portion of the algebra, we find generalized\nideals, and show that they describe concisely all of the Lorentz\nrepresentations of the standard model. From the complex octonionic portion of\nthe algebra, we find minimal left ideals, and show that they mirror the\nbehaviour of a generation of quarks and leptons under $su(3)_c$ and\n$u(1)_{em}$. We then demonstrate a rudimentary electroweak model which yields a\nstraightforward explanation as to why $SU(2)_L$ acts only on left-handed\nstates. This holds in the case of leptons.\n  Finally, we demonstrate how $\\mathbb{C}\\otimes\\mathbb{O}$ can generate a\n64-$\\mathbb{C}$-dimensional algebra, wherein we find the $SU(3)_c$ irreducible\nrepresentations corresponding to three generations of quarks and leptons. We\nthen conclude by showing how to arrive at all 48 electric charges.\n", "  The Gaia Archive provides access to observations of around a billion sky\nsources. The primary access to this archive is via TAP services such as GACS\nand ARI-Gaia, which allow execution of SQL-like queries against a large remote\ndatabase returning a result set of manageable size for client-side use. Such\nservices are generally used for extracting relatively small source lists\naccording to potentially complex selection criteria. But they can also be used\nto obtain statistical information about all, or a large fraction of, the\nobserved sources by building histogram-like results.\n  We examine here the practicalities of producing and consuming all-sky HEALPix\nweighted density maps in this way for Gaia and other large datasets. We present\nsome modest requirements on TAP/RDBMS services to enable such queries, and\ndiscuss visualisation and serialization options for the results including some\nnew capabilities in recent versions of TOPCAT.\n", "  SU(2) gauge theories with two quark flavours in the fundamental\nrepresentation are among the most promising theories of composite dynamics\ndescribing the electroweak sector. Three out of five Goldstone bosons in these\nmodels become the longitudinal components of the W and Z bosons giving them\nmass. Like in QCD, we expect a spectrum of excitations which appear as\nresonances in vector boson scattering, in particular the vector resonance\ncorresponding to the rho-meson in QCD. In this talk I will present the\npreliminary results of the first calculation of the rho-meson decay width in\nthis theory, which is analogous to rho to two pions decay calculation in QCD.\nThe results presented were calculated in a moving frame with total momentum\n(0,0,1) on two ensembles. Future plans include using 3 moving frames on a\nlarger set of ensembles to extract the resonance parameters more reliably and\nalso take the chiral and continuum limits.\n", "  The gauge theory is the most important type of the field theory, in which the\ninteractions of the elementary particles are described by the exchange of the\ngauge bosons.In this article, the gauge theory is reexamined as geometry of the\nvector space, and a new concept of \"little gauge theory\" is introduced. A key\npeculiarity of the little gauge theory is that the theory is able to give a\nrestriction for form of the connection field. Based on the little gauge theory,\nCartan geometry, a charged boson and the Dirac fermion field theory are\ninvestigated. In particular, the Dirac fermion field theory leads to an\nextension of Sogami's covariant derivative. And it is interpreted that Higgs\nbosons are included in new fields introduced in this article.\n", "  This article presents a new quantum-like model for cognition explicitly based\non knowledge. It is shown that this model, called QKT (quantum knowledge-based\ntheory), is able to coherently describe some experimental results that are\nproblematic for the prior quantum-like decision models. In particular, I\nconsider the experimental results relevant to the post-decision cognitive\ndissonance, the problems relevant to the question order effect and response\nreplicability, and those relevant to the grand-reciprocity equations. A new set\nof postulates is proposed, which evidence the different meaning given to the\nprojectors and to the quantum states. In the final part, I show that the use of\nquantum gates can help to better describe and understand the evolution of\nquantum-like models.\n", "  We study the maximum speed of quantum computation and how it is affected by\nlimitations on physical resources. We show how the resulting concepts\ngeneralize to a broader class of physical models of computation within\ndynamical systems and introduce a specific algebraic structure representing\nthese speed limits. We derive a family of quantum speed limit results in\nresource-constrained quantum systems with pure states and a finite dimensional\nstate space, by using a geometric method based on right invariant action\nfunctionals on $SU(N)$. We show that when the action functional is\nbi-invariant, the minimum time for implementing any quantum gate using a\npotentially time-dependent Hamiltonian is equal to the minimum time when using\na constant Hamiltonian, thus constant Hamiltonians are time optimal for these\nconstraints. We give an explicit formula for the time in these cases, in terms\nof the resource constraint. We show how our method produces a rich family of\nspeed limit results, of which the generalized Margolus--Levitin theorem and the\nMandelstam--Tamm inequality are special cases. We discuss the broader context\nof geometric approaches to speed limits in physical computation, including the\nway geometric approaches to quantum speed limits are a model for physical speed\nlimits to computation arising from a limited resource.\n", "  Scalar-tensor theory has arbitrary functions of the scalar field in front of\nthe geometric and scalar terms in the Lagrangain. The extent to which these\narbitrary functions appear in the Wheeler-deWitt wavefunction of mini-super\nRobertson-Walker spacetimes is discussed. The function of the scalar field in\nfront of the Einstein-Hilbert action allows a current to be constructed which\nsuggests transfer from matter to geometry of aspects of the wavefunction.\n", "  Introductory lectures notes on cosmology, aimed at master students in physics\nand based on a course held at Milano University (in Italian).\n", "  (Abridged abstract.) In this thesis we introduce new models of quantum\ncomputation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer\nalgorithms.\n  Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named\nnormalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit\nClifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and $\\pi/4$-phase gates): a normalizer circuit\nconsists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic\nphase gates associated to a set $G$, which is either an abelian group or\nabelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically\nsimulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated\nfactoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup\nProblems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under\nwhich scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we\ndevise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results\noffer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic\nproblems.\n  Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic)\nframework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating\nquantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism\n(PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer\ngroups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit\nsystems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable\nsystems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems. These results enlarge the known\nfamilies of quantum processes that can be efficiently classically simulated.\n  This thesis also establishes a precise connection between Shor's quantum\nalgorithm and the stabilizer formalism, revealing a common mathematical\nstructure in several quantum speed-ups and error-correcting codes.\n", "  We use a simple Hubbard model to characterize the electronic excited states\nof the dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecule; we compute the excited state transition\nenergies and oscillator strengths from the ground state to several singlet\nexcited states. We consider the lowest singlet and triplet states of the\nmolecule, examine their wavefunctions, and compute the density correlation\nfunctions that describe these states. We find that the DBT ground state is\nmostly a closed shell singlet with very slight radical character. We predict a\nrelatively small singlet-triplet splitting of 0.75 eV, which is less than the\nmid-sized -acenes but larger than literature predictions for this state; this\nis because the Hubbard interaction makes a very small correction to the singlet\nand triplet states.\n", "  Self-assembly of protein monomers into distinct membrane protein oligomers\nprovides a general mechanism for diversity in the molecular architectures, and\nresulting biological functions, of membrane proteins. We develop a general\nphysical framework describing the thermodynamic competition between different\noligomeric states of membrane proteins. Using the mechanosensitive channel of\nlarge conductance as a model system, we show how the dominant oligomeric states\nof membrane proteins emerge from the interplay of protein concentration in the\ncell membrane, protein-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and direct\nmonomer-monomer interactions. Our results suggest general physical mechanisms\nand principles underlying regulation of protein function via control of\nmembrane protein oligomeric state.\n", "  We investigate existence of solitonic solutions for higher-order partial\ndifferential equations with polynomial nonlinearities. Using the Hirota method\nwe obtain classification for higher-order integrable systems of equations.\n", "  We present a reply to the objections raised by M. J. W. Hall against our\nextension of Gleason's theorem.\n", "  The Fermi surface anisotropy of a pseudo-gap in the spectral weight, caused\nby superconducting fluctuations or anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations, is\ncalculated for a tight binding band. The importance of the Fermi surface saddle\npoint, or hot spot, is illustrated. A peak-dip-hump structure due to a finite\nfrequency mode, is briefly explored. The connection to high temperature\nsuperconducting copper-oxides is discussed.\n", "  We study collider phenomenology of the so-called 331 model with\n$SU(3)_C\\otimes SU(3)_L\\otimes U(1)_X$ gauge structure at the large hadron\ncollider, including single and double Higgs boson productions, Higgs boson rare\ndecay, $Z^\\prime$ boson production, new charged gauge boson pair production,\nand heavy quark pair production. We discuss all the possible collider\nsignatures of new particle productions. Four benchmark 331 models, $\\beta=\\pm\n\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\beta=\\pm 1/\\sqrt{3}$, are studied in this work.\n", "  The emergence of cosmic structure is commonly considered one of the most\ncomplex phenomena in Nature. However, this complexity has never been defined\nnor measured in a quantitative and objective way. In this work we propose a\nmethod to measure the information content of cosmic structure and to quantify\nthe complexity that emerges from it, based on Information Theory. The emergence\nof complex evolutionary patterns is studied with a statistical symbolic\nanalysis of the datastream produced by state-of-the-art cosmological\nsimulations of forming galaxy clusters. This powerful approach allows us to\nmeasure how many bits of information are necessary to predict the evolution of\nenergy fields in a statistical way, and it offers a simple way to quantify\nwhen, where and how the cosmic gas behaves in complex ways. The most complex\nbehaviors are found in the peripheral regions of galaxy clusters, where\nsupersonic flows drive shocks and large energy fluctuations over a few tens of\nmillion years. Describing the evolution of magnetic energy requires at least a\ntwice as large amount of bits than for the other energy fields. When radiative\ncooling and feedback from galaxy formation are considered, the cosmic gas is\noverall found to double its degree of complexity. In the future, Cosmic\nInformation Theory can significantly increase our understanding of the\nemergence of cosmic structure as it represents an innovative framework to\ndesign and analyze complex simulations of the Universe in a simple, yet\npowerful way.\n", "  A general scheme to calculate dynamical susceptibilities of strongly\ncorrelated electron systems within the dynamical mean field theory is\ndeveloped. Approach is based on an expansion over electron hopping around the\natomic limit (within the diagrammatic technique for site operators: projection\nand Hubbard ones) in infinite dimensions. As an example, the Falicov-Kimball\nand simplified pseudospin-electron models are considered for which an\nanalytical expressions for dynamical susceptibilities are obtained.\n", "  Energy spectrum and thermodynamics of the pseudospin-electron model\nintroduced at the consideration of the anharmonicity effects in high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors are investigated in the dynamical mean field approximation\n($d=\\infty$ limit). In the limit of zero electron correlation $U\\to 0$ this\nmodel is analytically exactly soluble within this approach: in the $\\mu=const$\nregime the first order phase transition with the jump of the pseudospin mean\nvalue $<S^z>$ and reconstruction of the electron spectrum can realize, while in\nthe $n=const$ regime the phase separation in electron subsystem can take place\nfor certain values of the model parameters. On the basis of the obtained\nresults the applicability of the approximate schemes previously used for the\ninvestigation of the pseudospin-electron model are discussed.\n"]}
