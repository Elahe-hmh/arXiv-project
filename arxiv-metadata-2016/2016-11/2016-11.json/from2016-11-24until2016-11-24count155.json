The relative importance of these mechanisms depends upon the flow\nregime of the gas, the mechanical state of the granular material, and other\nphysical parameters. Here we report research in two specific regimes: viscous\nerosion forming scour holes as a function of particle size and gravity; and\nbearing capacity failure forming deep transient craters as a function of soil\ncompaction.\n", "  A method combining photogrammetry with ballistic analysis is demonstrated to\nidentify flying debris in a rocket launch environment. Debris traveling near\nthe STS-124 Space Shuttle was captured on cameras viewing the launch pad within\nthe first few seconds after launch. One particular piece of debris caught the\nattention of investigators studying the release of flame trench fire bricks\nbecause its high trajectory could indicate a flight risk to the Space Shuttle.\nDigitized images from two pad perimeter high-speed 16-mm film cameras were\nprocessed using photogrammetry software based on a multi-parameter optimization\ntechnique. Reference points in the image were found from 3D CAD models of the\nlaunch pad and from surveyed points on the pad. The three-dimensional reference\npoints were matched to the equivalent two-dimensional camera projections by\noptimizing the camera model parameters using a gradient search optimization\ntechnique. Using this method of solving the triangulation problem, the xyz\nposition of the object's path relative to the reference point coordinate system\nwas found for every set of synchronized images. This trajectory was then\ncompared to a predicted trajectory while performing regression analysis on the\nballistic coefficient and other parameters. This identified, with a high degree\nof confidence, the object's material density and thus its probable origin\nwithin the launch pad environment. Future extensions of this methodology may\nmake it possible to diagnose the underlying causes of debris-releasing events\nin near-real time, thus improving flight safety.\n", "  The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential inclusive production cross section of the prompt\ncharm-strange meson $\\rm D_s^+$ in the rapidity range $|y|<0.5$ was measured in\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV at the LHC using the ALICE\ndetector. The analysis was performed on a data sample of $2.98 \\times 10^8$\nevents collected with a minimum-bias trigger. The corresponding integrated\nluminosity is $L_{\\rm int}=4.8$/nb. Reconstructing the decay ${\\rm D_s^{+}\\to\n\\phi\\pi^+}$, with $\\phi\\to {\\rm K}^-{\\rm K}^+$, and its charge conjugate, about\n480 ${\\rm D_s^{\\pm}}$ mesons were counted, after selection cuts, in the\ntransverse momentum range $2<p_{\\rm T}<12$ Gev/$c$. The results are compared\nwith predictions from models based on perturbative QCD. The ratios of the cross\nsections of four D meson species (namely ${\\rm D^0}$, ${\\rm D^+}$, ${\\rm\nD^{*+}}$ and ${\\rm D_s^+}$) were determined both as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$\nand integrated over $p_{\\rm T}$ after extrapolating to full $p_{\\rm T}$ range,\ntogether with the strangeness suppression factor in charm fragmentation. The\nobtained values are found to be compatible within uncertainties with those\nmeasured by other experiments in $\\rm e^+e^-$, ep and pp interactions at\nvarious centre-of-mass energies.\n", "  We prove that every geometric Lorenz attractor has superpolynomial decay of\ncorrelations with respect to the unique SRB measure. Moreover, we prove the\nCentral Limit Theorem and Almost Sure Invariance Principle for the time-1 map\nof the flow of geometric Lorenz attractors. In particular, our results apply to\nthe classical Lorenz attractor.\n", "  Recently, the {\\it Belle} and {\\it BABAR} Collaborations published the\nsingle-inclusive electron-positron annihilation data at the center of mass\nenergies ($\\sqrt{s}$) of $10.52$ GeV and $10.54$ GeV, respectively. These new\ndata offer one the possibility to determine the nonperturbative initial\nconditions of fragmentation functions much more accurately. In our previous\nwork \\cite{Soleymaninia:2013cxa}, we extracted the fragmentation functions for\n$\\pi^\\pm$ and $K^\\pm$ particles at next-to-leading order (NLO) including these\nnew data, for the first time. These new data are in the regions of larger\nscaled-energy $z$ and lower $\\sqrt{s}$. Our main purpose is to show that adding\nthese new data in our analysis how much improve the fragmentation functions of\n$\\pi^\\pm$ and $K^\\pm$ at NLO. We hope this analysis can obvious the effects of\nthese recent data on FFs for whom is studying the behavior of light meson FFs.\nWe also apply, for the first time, the extracted fragmentation functions to\nmake our predictions for the scaled-energy distributions of $\\pi^\\pm$ and\n$K^\\pm$ inclusively produced in polarized top quark decays at NLO.\n", "  Andoyer variables are well known for the study of rotational dynamics. These\nvariables were derived by Andoyer through a procedure that can be also used to\nobtain the Hill variables of the Kepler problem. Andoyer construction can also\nforecast the Delaunay variables which canonicity is then obtained without the\nuse of a generating function.\n", "  We elaborate the possibility for a deformed extra space to be considered as\nthe dark matter candidate. To perform calculations a class of two-dimensional\nextra metrics was considered in the framework of the multidimensional gravity.\nIt was shown that there exists a family of stationary metrics of the extra\nspace possessing point-like defect. Estimation of cross section of scattering\nof a particle of the ordinary matter on a spatial domain with deformed extra\nspace is in agreement with the observational constraints.\n", "  The powerful Lagrangian view of structure formation was essentially\nintroduced to cosmology by Zel'dovich. In the current cosmological paradigm, a\ndark-matter-sheet 3D manifold, inhabiting 6D position-velocity phase space, was\nflat (with vanishing velocity) at the big bang. Afterward, gravity stretched\nand bunched the sheet together in different places, forming a cosmic web when\nprojected to the position coordinates. Here, I explain some properties of an\norigami approximation, in which the sheet does not stretch or contract (an\nassumption that is false in general), but is allowed to fold. Even without\nstretching, the sheet can form an idealized cosmic web, with convex polyhedral\nvoids separated by straight walls and filaments, joined by convex polyhedral\nnodes. The nodes form in 'polygonal' or 'polyhedral' collapse, somewhat like\nspherical/ellipsoidal collapse, except incorporating simultaneous filament and\nwall formation. The origami approximation allows phase-space geometries of\nnodes, filaments, and walls to be more easily understood, and may aid in\nunderstanding spin correlations between nearby galaxies. This contribution\nexplores kinematic origami-approximation models giving velocity fields for the\nfirst time.\n", "  Although accumulation of molecular damage is suggested to be an important\nmolecular mechanism of aging, a quantitative link between the dynamics of\ndamage accumulation and mortality of species has so far remained elusive. To\naddress this question, we examine stability properties of a generic gene\nregulatory network (GRN) and demonstrate that many characteristics of aging and\nthe associated population mortality rate emerge as inherent properties of the\ncritical dynamics of gene regulation and metabolic levels. Based on the\nanalysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in\nDrosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly\ncritical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in\nthe form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and\ncauses the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a\nform of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality\ndeceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that\naging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory\nerrors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of\nsignaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We\nalso establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting\ngenetic control. Since mortality in humans, where it is characterized best, is\nstrongly associated with the incidence of age-related diseases, our findings\nsupport the idea that aging is the driving force behind the development of\nchronic human diseases.\n", "  Ferromagnets are believed to exhibit strongly anisotropic spin relaxation,\nwith relaxation lengths for spin longitudinal to magnetization significantly\nlonger than those for spin transverse to magnetization. Here we characterize\nthe anisotropy of spin relaxation in Co using the spin pumping contribution to\nGilbert damping in noncollinearly magnetized Py$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$/Cu/Co trilayer\nstructures. The static magnetization angle between Py$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ and Co,\nadjusted under field bias perpendicular to film planes, controls the\nprojections of longitudinal and transverse spin current pumped from\nPy$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$ into Co. We find nearly isotropic absorption of pure spin\ncurrent in Co using this technique; fits to a diffusive transport model yield\nthe longitudinal spin relaxation length $< 2$ nm in Co. The longitudinal spin\nrelaxation lengths found are an order of magnitude smaller than those\ndetermined by current-perpendicular-to-planes giant magnetoresistance\nmeasurements, but comparable with transverse spin relaxation lengths in Co\ndetermined by spin pumping.\n", "  A Magnetic Cluster Expansion (MCE) model for ternary face-centered cubic\nFe-Ni-Cr alloys has been developed using DFT data spanning binary and ternary\nalloy configurations. Using this MCE model Hamiltonian, we perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations and explore magnetic structures of alloys over the entire range of\nalloy compositions, considering both random and ordered alloy structures. In\nrandom alloys, the removal of magnetic collinearity constraint reduces the\ntotal magnetic moment but does not affect the predicted range of compositions\nwhere the alloys adopt low temperature ferromagnetic configurations. During\nalloying of ordered fcc Fe-Ni compounds with Cr, chromium atoms tend to replace\nnickel rather than iron atoms. Replacement of Ni by Cr in alloys with high iron\ncontent increases the Curie temperature of the alloys. This can be explained by\nstrong antiferromagnetic Fe-Cr coupling, similar to that found in bcc Fe-Cr\nsolutions, where the Curie temperature increase, predicted by simulations as a\nfunction of Cr concentration, is confirmed by experimental observations.\n", "  A global signature of the build-up to an intrinsic ELM is found in the phase\nof signals measured in full flux azimuthal loops in the divertor region of JET.\nFull flux loop signals provide a global measurement proportional to the voltage\ninduced by changes in poloidal magnetic flux; they are electromagnetically\ninduced by the dynamics of spatially integrated current density. We perform\ndirect time-domain analysis of the high time-resolution full flux loop signals\nVLD2 and VLD3. We analyze plasmas where a steady H-mode is sustained over\nseveral seconds, during which all the observed ELMs are intrinsic; there is no\ndeliberate intent to pace the ELMing process by external means. ELM occurrence\ntimes are determined from the Be II emission at the divertor. We previously\nfound that the occurrence times of intrinsic ELMs correlate with specific\nphases of the VLD2 and VLD3 signals. Here, we investigate how the VLD2 and VLD3\nphases vary with time in advance of the ELM occurrence time. We identify a\nbuild-up to the ELM in which the VLD2 and VLD3 signals progressively align to\nthe phase at which ELMs preferentially occur, on a ~ 2 -5ms timescale. At the\nsame time, the VLD2 and VLD3 signals become phase synchronized with each other,\nconsistent with the emergence of coherent global dynamics in the integrated\ncurrent density. In a plasma that remains close to a global magnetic\nequilibrium, this can reflect bulk displacement or motion of the plasma. This\nbuild-up signature to an intrinsic ELM can be extracted from a time interval of\ndata that does not extend beyond the ELM occurrence time, so that these full\nflux loop signals could assist in ELM prediction or mitigation.\n", "  We discuss the physics of interacting tensor fields and particles living in\n$M=\\mathrm{S0}(1,4)/\\mathrm{S0} (1,3)\\simeq\\mathbb{R}\\times S^{3}$ a\nsubmanifold of $\\mathring{M}=(\\mathbb{R}^{5},\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}})$, where\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathring {g}}$ has signature $(1,4)$. Structure\n$(M,\\boldsymbol{g})$ where $(\\boldsymbol{g=i}^{\\ast}\\boldsymbol{\\mathring{g}})$\nis a Lorentzian manifold. Structure\n$(M,\\boldsymbol{g,}\\tau_{\\boldsymbol{g}},\\uparrow)$ is primely used to study\nthe energy-momentum conservation law (for a system of physical fields (and\nparticles) living in $M$ and to get the respective equations of motion. We\nconstruct two different de Sitter spacetime structures\n$M^{dSL}=(M,\\boldsymbol{g,D},\\tau_{\\boldsymbol{g}},\\uparrow)$ and\n$M^{dSTP}=(M,\\boldsymbol{g,\\nabla},\\tau_{\\boldsymbol{g} },\\uparrow)$. Both\n(metrical compatible) connections are used only as mathematical devices. In\nparticular $M^{dSL}$ is not supposed to be the model of any gravitational field\nin the(\\textbf{GRT}). We clarify some misconceptions appearing in the\nliterature. We use the Clifford and spin-Clifford bundles formalism and gives a\nthoughtful presentation of the concept of a Komar current $\\mathcal{J}_{A}$ (in\nGRT}) associated to any vector field $\\mathbf{A}$. A formula for the Komar\ncurrent and its physical meaning are given. We show also how $F=dA$ satisfy in\nthe Clifford bundle a Maxwell like equation encoding the contents of Einstein\nequation. We show that in GRT there are infinitely many conserved\ncurrents,independently of the fact that the Lorentzian spacetime possess or not\nKilling vector fields and that even when the appropriate Killing vector fields\nexist there does not exist a conserved energy-momentum covector (not a covector\nfield) as in SRT.\n", "  This work presents a detailed characterisation of the MAST Scrape Off Layer\nin L-mode. Scans in line averaged density, plasma current and toroidal magnetic\nfield were performed. A comprehensive and integrated study of the SOL was\nallowed by the use of a wide range of diagnostics. In agreement with previous\nresults, an increase of the line averaged density induced a broadening of the\nmidplane density profile.\n", "  A persistent spin helix (PSH) is a robust helical spin-density pattern\narising in disordered 2D electron gases with Rashba $\\alpha$ and Dresselhaus\n$\\beta$ spin-orbit (SO) tuned couplings, i.e., $\\alpha=\\pm\\beta$. Here we\ninvestigate the emergence of a Persistent Skyrmion Lattice (PSL) resulting from\nthe coherent superposition of PSHs along orthogonal directions -- crossed PSHs\n-- in wells with two occupied subbands $\\nu=1,2$. For realistic GaAs wells we\nshow that the Rashba $\\alpha_\\nu$ and Dresselhaus $\\beta_\\nu$ couplings can be\nsimultaneously tuned to equal strengths but opposite signs, e.g., $\\alpha_1=\n\\beta_1$ and $\\alpha_2=-\\beta_2$. In this regime and away from band\nanticrossings, our {\\it non-interacting} electron gas sustains a topologically\nnon-trivial skyrmion-lattice spin-density excitation, which inherits the\nrobustness against spin-independent disorder and interactions from its\nunderlying crossed PSHs. We find that the spin relaxation rate due to the\ninterband SO coupling is comparable to that of the cubic Dresselhaus term as a\nmechanism of the PSL decay. Near anticrossings, the interband-induced spin\nmixing leads to unusual spin textures along the energy contours beyond those of\nthe Rahsba-Dresselhaus bands. Our PSL opens up the unique possibility of\nobserving topological phenomena, e.g., topological and skyrmion Hall effects,\nin ordinary GaAs wells with non-interacting electrons.\n", "  We study the Weyl-Wigner transform in the case of discrete variables defined\nin a Hilbert space of finite prime-number dimensionality $N$. We define a\nfamily of Weyl-Wigner transforms as function of a phase parameter. We show that\nit is only for a specific value of the parameter that all the properties we\nhave examined have a parallel with the case of continuous variables defined in\nan infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. A geometrical interpretation is briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  We characterize the asymptotic performance of a class of positive operator\nvalued measurements (POVMs) where the only task is to make measurements on\nindependent and identically distributed quantum states on finite-dimensional\nsystems. The POVMs we utilize here can be efficiently described in terms of a\nreasonably small set of parameters. Their analysis furthers the development of\na quantum method of types. They deliver provably optimal performance in\nasymmetric hypothesis testing and in the transmission of classical messages\nover quantum channels. We now relate them to the recently developed $\\alpha-z$\ndivergences $D_{\\alpha,z}$ by giving an operational interpretation for the\nlimiting case $\\lim_{\\alpha\\to1}D_{\\alpha,1-\\alpha}$ in terms of probabilities\nfor certain measurement outcomes. This explains one of the more surprising\nfindings of [1] in terms of the theory of group representations. In addition,\nwe provide a Cauchy-Binet type formula for unitary matrices which connects the\nunderlying representation theoretic objects to partial sums of the entries of\nunitary matrices. At last, we concentrate on the special case of qubits. We are\nable to give a complete description of the asymptotic detection probabilities\nfor all POVM elements described here. We take the opportunity to define a\nfamily of functions on pairs of semi-definite matrices which obeys the quantum\ngeneralizations of R\\'enyi's axioms except from the generalized mean value\naxiom. This family is described by limiting values of $\\alpha-z$ divergences\nfor the extremal values of the parameter.\n", "  We derive a formula which applies to conformal field theories on a spatial\ntorus and gives the asymptotic density of states solely in terms of the vacuum\nenergy on a parallel plate geometry. The formula follows immediately from\nglobal scale and Lorentz invariance, but to our knowledge has not previously\nbeen made explicit. It can also be understood from the fact that $\\log Z$ on\n$\\mathbb{T}^2\\times \\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ transforms as the absolute value of a\nnon-holomorphic modular form of weight $d-1$, which we show. The results are\nextended to theories which violate Lorentz invariance and hyperscaling but\nmaintain a scaling symmetry. The formula is checked for the cases of a free\nscalar, free Maxwell gauge field, and free $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills.\nThe case of a Maxwell gauge field gives Casimir's original calculation of the\nelectromagnetic force between parallel plates in terms of the entropy of a\nphoton gas.\n", "  The interpretation of quantum theory is one of the longest-standing debates\nin physics. Type I interpretations see quantum probabilities as determined by\nintrinsic properties of the observed system. Type II see them as relational\nexperiences between an observer and the system. It is usually believed that a\ndecision between these two options cannot be made simply on purely physical\ngrounds but requires an act of metaphysical judgment. Here we show that, under\nsome assumptions, the problem is decidable using thermodynamics. We prove that\ntype I interpretations are incompatible with the following assumptions: (i) The\nchoice of which measurement is performed can be made randomly and independently\nof the system under observation, (ii) the system has limited memory, and (iii)\nLandauer's erasure principle holds.\n", "  Non-destructive detection of photonic qubits is an enabling technology for\nquantum information processing and quantum communication. For practical\napplications such as quantum repeaters and networks, it is desirable to\nimplement such detection in a way that allows some form of multiplexing as well\nas easy integration with other components such as solid-state quantum memories.\nHere we propose an approach to non-destructive photonic qubit detection that\npromises to have all the mentioned features. Mediated by an impurity-doped\ncrystal, a signal photon in an arbitrary time-bin qubit state modulates the\nphase of an intense probe pulse that is stored during the interaction. Using a\nthulium-doped waveguide in LiNbO$_3$, we perform a proof-of-principle\nexperiment with macroscopic signal pulses, demonstrating the expected\ncross-phase modulation as well as the ability to preserve the coherence between\ntemporal modes. Our findings open the path to a new key component of quantum\nphotonics based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals.\n", "  The complete refuelling of the plasma density loss (pump-out) caused by\nmitigation of Edge Localised Modes (ELMs) is demonstrated on the ASDEX Upgrade\ntokamak. The plasma is refuelled by injection of frozen deuterium pellets and\nELMs are mitigated by external resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs). In this\nexperiment relevant dimensionless parameters, such as relative pellet size,\nrelative RMP amplitude and pedestal collisionality are kept at the ITER like\nvalues. Refuelling of density pump out requires a factor of two increase of\nnominal fuelling rate. Energy confinement and pedestal temperatures are not\nrestored to pre-RMP values by pellet refuelling.\n", "  In Hybrid plasma operation in JET with its ITER-like wall (JET-ILW) it is\nfound that n>1 tearing activity can significantly enhance the rate of on-axis\npeaking of tungsten impurities, which in turn significantly degrades discharge\nperformance. Core n=1 instabilities can be beneficial in removing tungsten\nimpurities from the plasma core (e.g. sawteeth or fishbones), but can\nconversely also degrade core confinement (particularly in combination with\nsimultaneous n=3 activity). The nature of MHD instabilities in JET Hybrid\ndischarges, with both its previous Carbon wall and subsequent JET-ILW, is\nsurveyed statistically and the character of the instabilities is examined.\nPossible qualitative models for how the n>1 islands can enhance on-axis\ntungsten transport accumulation processes are presented.\n", "  The simplest Higgs-portal dark matter model is studied in the light of dark\nmatter self-interacting effects on the formation of large scale structures. We\nshow the direct detection limits on the resonant and large mass regions.\nFinally, we also compare these limits with those at the LHC and Xenon 1T\nexperiments.\n", "  We study harmonic maps from surfaces coupled to a scalar and a two-form\npotential, which arise as critical points of the action of the full bosonic\nstring. We investigate several analytic and geometric properties of these maps\nand prove an existence result by the heat flow method.\n", "  It is interesting to ask how a confinement scale affects the thermalization\nof strongly coupled gauge theories with gravity duals. We study this question\nfor the AdS soliton model, which underlies top-down holographic models for\nYang-Mills theory and QCD. Injecting energy via a homogeneous massless scalar\nsource that is briefly turned on, our fully backreacted numerical analysis\nfinds two regimes. Either a black brane forms, possibly after one or more\nbounces, after which the pressure components relax according to the lowest\nquasinormal mode. Or the scalar shell keeps scattering, in which case the\npressure components oscillate and undergo modulation on time scales independent\nof the (small) shell amplitude. We show analytically that the scattering shell\ncannot relax to a homogeneous equilibrium state, and explain the modulation as\ndue to a near-resonance between a normal mode frequency of the metric and the\nfrequency with which the scalar shell oscillates.\n", "  We provide mathematicaly rigorous justification of using term \"probability\"\nin connection to the so called non-signalling theories,known also as Popescu's\nand Rohrlich's box worlds. No only do we prove correctness of these models (in\nthe sense that they describe composite system of two independent subsystems)\nbut we obtain new properties of non-signalling boxes and expose new tools for\nfurther investigation. Moreover, it allows strightforward generalization to\nmore complicated systems.\n", "  We study collisions of many point-like particles in three-dimensional anti-de\nSitter space, generalizing the known result with two particles. We show how to\nconstruct exact solutions corresponding to the formation of either a black hole\nor a conical singularity from the collision of an arbitrary number of massless\nparticles falling in radially from the boundary. We find that when going away\nfrom the case of equal energies and discrete rotational symmetry, this is not a\ntrivial generalization of the two-particle case, but requires that the excised\nwedges corresponding to the particles must be chosen in a very precise way for\na consistent solution. We also explicitly take the limit when the number of\nparticles goes to infinity and obtain thin shell solutions that in general\nbreak rotational invariance, corresponding to an instantaneous and\ninhomogeneous perturbation at the boundary. We also compute the stress-energy\ntensor of the shell using the junction formalism for null shells and obtain\nagreement with the point particle picture.\n", "  PROCESS is a reactor systems code - it assesses the engineering and economic\nviability of a hypothetical fusion power station using simple models of all\nparts of a reactor system. PROCESS allows the user to choose which constraints\nto impose and which to ignore, so when evaluating the results it is vital to\nstudy the list of constraints used. New algorithms submitted by collaborators\ncan be incorporated - for example safety, first wall erosion, and fatigue life\nwill be crucial and are not yet taken into account. This paper describes\nalgorithms relating to the engineering aspects of the plant. The toroidal field\n(TF) coils and the central solenoid are assumed by default to be wound from\nniobium-tin superconductor with the same properties as the ITER conductors. The\nwinding temperature and induced voltage during a quench provide a limit on the\ncurrent density in the TF coils. Upper limits are placed on the stresses in the\nstructural materials of the TF coil, using a simple two-layer model of the\ninboard leg of the coil. The thermal efficiency of the plant can be estimated\nusing the maximum coolant temperature, and the capacity factor is derived from\nestimates of the planned and unplanned downtime, and the duty cycle if the\nreactor is pulsed. An example of a pulsed power plant is given.\n", "  There is mounting evidence for the binary nature of the progenitors of\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs). For a long GRB, the induced gravitational collapse\n(IGC) paradigm proposes as progenitor, or \"in-state\", a tight binary system\ncomposed of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{core}$) undergoing a supernova (SN)\nexplosion which triggers hypercritical accretion onto a neutron star (NS)\ncompanion. For a short GRB, a NS-NS merger is traditionally adopted as the\nprogenitor. We divide long and short GRBs into two sub-classes, depending on\nwhether or not a black hole (BH) is formed in the merger or in the\nhypercritical accretion process exceeding the NS critical mass. For long\nbursts, when no BH is formed we have the sub-class of X-ray flashes (XRFs),\nwith isotropic energy $E_{iso}\\lesssim10^{52}$ erg and rest-frame spectral peak\nenergy $E_{p,i}\\lesssim200$ keV. When a BH is formed we have the sub-class of\nbinary-driven hypernovae (BdHNe), with $E_{iso}\\gtrsim10^{52}$ erg and\n$E_{p,i}\\gtrsim200$ keV. In analogy, short bursts are similarly divided into\ntwo sub-classes. When no BH is formed, short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs) occur,\nwith $E_{iso}\\lesssim10^{52}$ erg and $E_{p,i}\\lesssim2$ MeV. When a BH is\nformed, the authentic short GRBs (S-GRBs) occur, with $E_{iso}\\gtrsim10^{52}$\nerg and $E_{p,i}\\gtrsim2$ MeV. We give examples and observational signatures of\nthese four sub-classes and their rate of occurrence. From their respective\nrates it is possible that \"in-states\" of S-GRFs and S-GRBs originate from the\n\"out-states\" of XRFs. We indicate two additional progenitor systems: white\ndwarf-NS and BH-NS. These systems have hybrid features between long and short\nbursts. In the case of S-GRBs and BdHNe evidence is given of the coincidence of\nthe onset of the high energy GeV emission with the birth of a Kerr BH.\n", "  In future nuclear fusion reactors high heat load events, such as\nedge-localised modes (ELMs), can potentially damage divertor materials and\nrelease impurities into the main plasma, limiting plasma performance. The most\ndifficult to handle are type I ELMs since they carry the largest fraction of\nenergy from the plasma and therefore deposit the largest heat flux at the\ntarget and on first wall materials. Knowing the temperature of the ions\nreleased from ELM events is important since it determines the potential\nsputtering they would cause from plasma facing materials. To make measurements\nof Ti by retarding field energy analyser (RFEA) during type I ELMs a new\noperational technique has been used to allow faster measurements to be made;\nthis is called the fast swept technique (FST).\n", "  Clear filamentary structures are observed at the edge of tokamak plasmas.\nThese filaments are ejected out radially and carry plasma in the far Scrape Off\nLayer (SOL) region, where they are responsible for producing most of the\ntransport. A study has been performed of the characteristics of the filaments\nobserved in L-mode plasma on MAST, using visible imaging. A comparison has then\nbeen made with the observed particle and power profiles obtained at the\ndivertor as a function of the plasma current. The radial velocity and to a\nlesser extent the radial size of the filaments are found to decrease as the\nplasma current is increased at constant density and input power. The results\nobtained in this paper on the dependence of the average filament dynamics on\nplasma current are consistent with the idea that the filaments are responsible\nfor determining the particle profiles at the divertor.\n", "  The results of a search for a supersymmetric partner of the top quark (top\nsquark), pair-produced in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, are\npresented. The search, which focuses on R-parity violating, chargino-mediated\ndecays of the top squark, is performed in final states with low missing\ntransverse momentum, two oppositely charged electrons or muons, and at least\nfive jets. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns collected with the CMS detector at the\nLHC in 2012. The data are found to be in agreement with the standard model\nexpectation, and upper limits are placed on the top squark pair production\ncross section at 95% confidence level. Assuming a 100% branching fraction for\nthe top squark decay chain, top squark to t + chargino, chargino to lepton +\njj, top squark masses less than 890 (1000) GeV for the electron (muon) channel\nare excluded for the first time in models with a single nonzero R-parity\nviolating coupling lambda'[ijk] (i,j,k <= 2), where i,j,k correspond to the\nthree generations.\n", "  We study the expansion of the Universe using an effective Friedmann equation\nobtained from the dynamics of GFT (Group Field Theory) isotropic condensates.\nThe evolution equations are classical, with quantum correction terms to the\nFriedmann equation given in the form of effective fluids coupled to the\nemergent classical background. The occurrence of a bounce, which resolves the\ninitial spacetime singularity, is shown to be a general property of the model.\nA promising feature of this model is the occurrence of an era of accelerated\nexpansion, without the need to introduce an inflaton field with an\nappropriately chosen potential. We discuss possible viability issues of this\nscenario as an alternative to inflation.\n", "  We explore exact f(R) gravity solutions that mimic Chaplygin-gas inspired\nLCDM cosmology. Starting with the original and modified Chaplygin gas equations\nof state, we reconstruct the forms of f(R) Lagrangians. The resulting solutions\nare generally quadratic in the Ricci scalar, but have appropriate LCDM\nsolutions in limiting cases. These solutions, given appropriate initial\nconditions, can be potential candidates for scalar field-driven early universe\nexpansion (inflation) and dark energy-driven late-time cosmic acceleration.\n", "  We consider the notion of unitary transformations forming bases for subspaces\nof $M(d,\\mathbb{C})$ such that the square of Hilbert-Schmidt inner product of\nmatrices from the differing bases is a constant. Moving from the qubit case,\nweconstruct the maximal number of such bases for the 4 and 2 dimensional\nsubspaces while proving the nonexistence of such a construction for the 3\ndimensional case. Extending this to higher dimensions, we commit to such a\nconstruct for the case of qutrits and provide evidence for the existence of\nsuch unitaries for prime dimensional quantum systems. Focusing on the qubit\ncase, we show that the average fidelity for estimating any of such a\ntransformation is equal to the case for estimating a completely unknown unitary\nfrom $\\text{SU}(2)$. This is then followed by a quick application for such\nunitaries in a quantum cryptographic setup.\n", "  We experimentally show that nonlocality can be produced from single-particle\ncontextuality by using two-particle correlations which do not violate any Bell\ninequality by themselves. This demonstrates that nonlocality can come from an\n{\\em a priori} different simpler phenomenon, and connects contextuality and\nnonlocality, the two critical resources for, respectively, quantum computation\nand secure communication. From the perspective of quantum information, our\nexperiment constitutes a proof of principle that quantum systems can be used\nsimultaneously for both quantum computation and secure communication.\n", "  An explanation of the observed improvement in H-mode pedestal characteristics\nwith increasing core plasma pressure or poloidal beta, as observed in MAST and\nJET, is sought in terms of the impact of the Shafranov shift, d', on ideal\nballooning MHD stability.\n", "  The process of nonlinear electron emission from a metal surface under the\naction of femtosecond laser pulse with moderate intensity\n$\\sim10^{11}$~W/cm$^2$ is considered. One-dimensional model is formulated,\ntaking into account the advantage of the $p$-polarized light in the nonlinear\nemission. The time dependent Schrodinger equation with fixed equilibrium\nboundary conditions is solved in the half-space using the Laplace transform\ntechnique. The energy spectrum of emitted electrons is obtained, and its\ndependence on the laser pulse parameters in compare with experimental data is\ndiscussed.\n", "  A majority of early-type galaxies contain interstellar dust, yet the origin\nof this dust, and why the dust sometimes exhibits unusual polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon (PAH) ratios, remains a mystery. If the dust is internally\nproduced, it likely originates from the large number of AGB stars associated\nwith the old stellar population. We present GALEX and WISE elliptical aperture\nphotometry of $\\sim310$ early-type galaxies with Spitzer mid-infrared\nspectroscopy and/or ancillary data from ATLAS3D, to characterize their\ncircumstellar dust and the shape of the radiation field that illuminates the\ninterstellar PAHs. We find that circumstellar dust is ubiquitous in early-type\ngalaxies, which indicates some tension between stellar population age estimates\nand models for circumstellar dust production in very old stellar populations.\nWe also use dynamical masses from ATLAS3D to show that WISE W1 (3.4 $\\mu$m)\nmass-to-light ratios are consistent with the initial mass function variation\nfound by previous work. While the stellar population differences in early-type\ngalaxies correspond to a range of radiation field shapes incident upon the\ndiffuse dust, the ratio of the ionization-sensitive $7.7\\mu$m to $11.3\\mu$m PAH\nfeature does not correlate with the shape of the radiation field, nor to\nvariations with the size-sensitive $11.3\\mu$m to $17\\mu$m ratio. The $7.7\\mu$m\nto $11.3\\mu$m PAH ratio does tend to be smaller in galaxies with proportionally\ngreater $H_2$ emission, which is evidence that processing of primarily smaller\ngrains by shocks is responsible for the unusual ratios, rather than substantial\ndifferences in the overall PAH size or ionization distribution.\n", "  A $Q$-enhancement strategy for racetrack microresonators is put forward. The\ndesign is based on the modification of the resonator geometry in order to\nmitigate the two main sources of radiation loss in the presence of curved\nwaveguides: the discontinuities at the junctions between straight waveguides\nand the bent sections, and the continuous loss at the curved waveguide sectors.\nAt the same time, the modifications of the geometry do not affect the\nversatility of coupling of racetrack resonators in integrated optical circuits,\nwhich is their main advantage over ring microresonators. The proposal is\napplied to the design of high-$Q$ racetrack resonators for the silicon nitride\nCMOS-compatible platform having bent radii amenable for large-scale photonic\nintegration. Numerical calculations show over $100\\%$ improvement of the $Q$\nfactor in $\\text{Si}_3\\text{N}_4/\\text{SiO}_2$ resonators.\n", "  We evaluate the next-to-leading order correction to the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel starting from quantum chromodynamics. We show that a systematic expansion\nexists, starting from a given set of exact classical solutions, so that higher\norder corrections could in principle be computed at any order. In this way, we\nare able to fix the constants of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model from quantum\nchromodynamics and analyze the behavior of strong interactions at low energies.\nThe technique is to expand in powers of currents of the generating functional.\nWe apply it to a simple Yukawa model with self-interaction showing how this has\na Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model and its higher order corrections as a low-energy\nlimit. The same is shown to happen for quantum chromodynamics in the chiral\nlimit with two quarks. We prove stability of the NJL model so obtained. Then,\nwe prove that the correction term we obtained does not change the critical\ntemperature of the chiral transition of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at zero\nchemical potential.\n", "  A theoretical framework is developed to link the density profiles in the\nScrape Off Layer (SOL) with the fluctuations (filaments) that generate them.\nThe framework is based on the dynamics of independent filaments and their\nstatistical behaviour and can be used to rigorously understand the mechanisms\nthat lead to flattening and broadening of the SOL profiles as well as the\nradial increase of the relative fluctuation amplitude.\n", "  Boundary element methods (BEM) are used for forward computation of\nbioelectromagnetic fields in multi-compartment volume conductor models. Most\nBEM approaches assume that each compartment is in contact with at most one\nexternal compartment. In this work, I present a general surface integral\nequation and BEM discretization that remove this limitation and allow BEM\nmodeling of general piecewise-homogeneous medium. The new integral equation\nallows positioning of field points at junctioned boundary of more than two\ncompartments, enabling the use of linear collocation BEM in such a complex\ngeometry. A modular BEM implementation is presented for linear collocation and\nGalerkin approaches, starting from standard formulation. The approach and\nresulting solver are verified in four ways, including comparisons of volume and\nsurface potentials to those obtained using the finite element method (FEM), and\nthe effect of a hole in skull on electroencephalographic scalp potentials is\ndemonstrated.\n", "  We suggest a theoretical framework for the description of double photon and\nproton-antiproton photoproduction off the proton gamma + p -> 2 gamma + p and\ngamma + p -> antip + p + p which takes into account the contribution of the\nscalar mesons f0(1370), f0(1500) and f0(1710). These scalars are considered as\nmixed states of a glueball and nonstrange and strange quarkonia. Our framework\nis based on the use of effective hadronic Lagrangians that phenomenologically\ntake into account two-gluon exchange effects governing the gamma + p -> 2 gamma\n+ p and gamma + p -> antip + p + p processes. Present results can be used to\nguide the possible search for these reactions by the GlueX Collaboration at\nJLab.\n", "  Applying Feynman diagrammatics to non-fermionic strongly correlated models\nwith local constraints might seem generically impossible for two separate\nreasons: (i) the necessity to have a Gaussian (non-interacting) limit on top of\nwhich the perturbative diagrammatic expansion is generated by Wick's theorem,\nand (ii) the Dyson's collapse argument implying that the expansion in powers of\ncoupling constant is divergent. We show that for arbitrary classical lattice\nmodels both problems can be solved/circumvented by reformulating the\nhigh-temperature expansion (more generally, any discrete representation of the\nmodel) in terms of Grassmann integrals. Discrete variables residing on either\nlinks, plaquettes, or sites of the lattice are associated with the Grassmann\nvariables in such a way that the partition function (and correlations) of the\noriginal system and its Grassmann-field counterpart are identical. The\nexpansion of the latter around its Gaussian point generates Feynman diagrams. A\nproof-of-principle implementation is presented for the classical 2D Ising\nmodel. Our work paves the way for studying lattice gauge theories by treating\nbosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom on equal footing.\n", "  We aim to describe a droplet bouncing on a vibrating bath using a simple and\nhighly versatile model inspired from quantum mechanics. Close to the Faraday\ninstability, a long-lived surface wave is created at each bounce, which serves\nas a pilot wave for the droplet. This leads to so called walking droplets or\nwalkers. Since the seminal experiment by {\\it Couder et al} [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 97}, 154101 (2006)] there have been many attempts to accurately reproduce\nthe experimental results. We propose to describe the trajectories of a walker\nusing a Green function approach. The Green function is related to the Helmholtz\nequation with Neumann boundary conditions on the obstacle(s) and outgoing\nboundary conditions at infinity. For a single-slit geometry our model is\nexactly solvable and reproduces some general features observed experimentally.\nIt stands for a promising candidate to account for the presence of arbitrary\nboundaries in the walker's dynamics.\n", "  This article is based on a talk by S.S. at the Nambu Memorial Symposium at\nthe University of Chicago. We review ideas on the nature of the metallic states\nof the hole-doped cuprate high temperature superconductors, with an emphasis on\nthe connections between the Luttinger theorem for the size of the Fermi\nsurface, topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), and critical theories\ninvolving changes in the size of the Fermi surface. We begin with the\nderivation of the Luttinger theorem for a Fermi liquid, using momentum balance\nduring a process of flux-insertion in a lattice electronic model with toroidal\nboundary conditions. We then review the TQFT of the Z2 spin liquid, and\ndemonstrate its compatibility with the toroidal momentum balance argument. This\ndiscussion leads naturally to a simple construction of `topological' Fermi\nliquid states: the fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) and the algebraic charge\nliquid (ACL). We present arguments for a description of the pseudogap metal of\nthe cuprates using Z2-FL* or Z2-ACL states with Ising-nematic order. These\npseudogap metal states are also described as Higgs phases of a SU(2) gauge\ntheory. The Higgs field represents local antiferromagnetism, but the\nHiggs-condensed phase does not have long-range antiferromagnetic order: the\nmagnitude of the Higgs field determines the pseudogap, the reconstruction of\nthe Fermi surface, and the Ising-nematic order. Finally, we discuss the route\nto the large Fermi surface Fermi liquid via the critical point where the Higgs\ncondensate and Ising nematic order vanish, and the application of Higgs\ncriticality to the strange metal.\n", "  Quantum random number generators (QRNG) represent an advanced solution for\nrandomness generation, essential in every cryptographic applications. In this\ncontext, integrated arrays of single photon detectors have promising\napplications as QRNGs based on the spatial detection of photons. For the\nemployment of QRNGs in Cryptography, it is necessary to have efficient methods\nto evaluate the so called quantum min-entropy that corresponds to the amount of\nthe true extractable quantum randomness from the QRNG. Here we present an\nefficient method that allow to estimate the quantum min-entropy for a\nmulti-detector QRNG. In particular, we will consider a scenario in which an\nattacker can control the efficiency of the detectors and knows the emitted\nnumber of photons. Eventually, we apply the method to a QRNG with $10^3$\ndetectors.\n", "  Three aspects of the SU(3) fusion coefficients are revisited: the generating\npolynomials of fusion coefficients are written explicitly; some curious\nidentities generalizing the classical Freudenthal-de Vries formula are derived;\nand the properties of the fusion coefficients under conjugation of one of the\nfactors, previously analysed in the classical case, are extended to the affine\nalgebra of su(3) at finite level.\n", "  In the scenario of gauge-Higgs unification, the origin of the Higgs boson is\nhigher dimensional gauge boson. Reflecting its origin, very characteristic\npredictions are made of the Higgs boson interactions in this scenario.\nEspecially, a remarkable claim has been made: the contribution of non-zero\nKaluza-Klein modes to the Higgs decay $H \\to Z \\gamma$ exactly vanishes in the\nminimal SU(3) electro-weak unified model, at least at the one-loop level. In\nthis brief report, in order to see whether this prediction is a general feature\nof the scenario or the consequence of the specific choice of the model, matter\ncontent or the order of perturbative expansion, we perform an operator\nanalysis. We demonstrate that there does not exist any relevant operator,\nrespecting the gauge symmetry SU(3) in the bulk. We also comment on the\npossibly important contribution to the photonic decay $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ due\nto the non-zero Kaluza-Klein modes of light quarks.\n", "  We present an unbiased determination of the charm content of the proton, in\nwhich the charm parton distribution function (PDF) is parametrized on the same\nfooting as the light quarks and the gluon in a global PDF analysis. This\ndetermination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions\nin the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated\ncontributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is\nassumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light\nquarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find\nthat the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV\nfor all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient\nfunctions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and\nlow scales does not vanish, but rather has an \"intrinsic\" component, very\nweakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying\nabout 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other\nPDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the\ndependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm\nstructure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and\nPDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we\nverify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our\nfindings. The increased stability with respect to m_c persists at high scales\nand is the main implication of our results for LHC phenomenology. Fitting the\ncharm PDF modifies the predictions for processes such as high p_T and large\nrapidity charm pair production and Z+c production, and thus we expect that\nfuture LHC data will further constrain the charm content of the proton.\n", "  Including finite-temperature effects from the electronic degrees of freedom\nin electronic structure calculations of semiconductors and metals is desired;\nhowever, in practice it remains exceedingly difficult when using\nzero-temperature methods, since these methods require an explicit evaluation of\nmultiple excited states in order to account for any finite-temperature effects.\nUsing a Matsubara Green's function formalism remains a viable alternative,\nsince in this formalism it is easier to include thermal effects and to connect\nthe dynamic quantities such as the self-energy with static thermodynamic\nquantities such as the Helmholtz energy, entropy, and internal energy. However,\ndespite the promising properties of this formalism, little is know about the\nmultiple solutions of the non-linear equations present in the self-consistent\nMatsubara formalism and only a few cases involving a full Coulomb Hamiltonian\nwere investigated in the past. Here, to shed some light onto the iterative\nnature of the Green's function solutions, we self-consistently evaluate the\nthermodynamic quantities for a one-dimensional (1D) hydrogen solid at various\ninteratomic separations and temperatures using the self-energy approximated to\nsecond-order (GF2). At many points in the phase diagram of this system,\nmultiple phases such as a metal and an insulator exist, and we are able to\ndetermine the most stable phase from the analysis of Helmholtz energies.\nAdditionally, we show the evolution of the spectrum of 1D boron nitride (BN) to\ndemonstrate that GF2 is capable of qualitatively describing the temperature\neffects influencing the size of the band gap.\n", "  Nonclassical quantum effects gradually reach domains of physics of large\nsystems previously considered as purely classical. We derive a hierarchy of\noperational criteria suitable for a reliable detection of nonclassicality of\nlight from an arbitrarily large ensemble of independent single-photon emitters.\nWe show, that such large ensemble can always emit nonclassical light without\nany phase reference and under realistic experimental conditions including\nincoherent background noise. The nonclassical light from the large ensemble of\nthe emitters can be witnessed much better than light coming from a single or a\nfew emitters.\n", "  We study scalar products of Bethe vectors in integrable models solvable by\nnested algebraic Bethe ansatz and possessing $\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ symmetry.\nUsing explicit formulas of the monodromy matrix entries multiple actions onto\nBethe vectors we obtain a representation for the scalar product in the most\ngeneral case. This explicit representation appears to be a sum over partitions\nof the Bethe parameters. It can be used for the analysis of scalar products\ninvolving on-shell Bethe vectors.\n  As a by-product, we obtain a determinant representation for the scalar\nproducts of generic Bethe vectors in integrable models with\n$\\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ symmetry.\n", "  Intracellular transport is vital for the proper functioning and survival of a\ncell. Cargo (proteins, vesicles, organelles, etc.) is transferred from its\nplace of creation to its target locations via molecular motor assisted\ntransport along cytoskeletal filaments. The transport efficiency is strongly\naffected by the spatial organization of the cytoskeleton, which constitutes an\ninhomogeneous, complex network. In cells with a centrosome microtubules grow\nradially from the central microtubule organizing center towards the cell\nperiphery whereas actin filaments form a dense meshwork, the actin cortex,\nunderneath the cell membrane with a broad range of orientations. The emerging\nballistic motion along filaments is frequently interrupted due to constricting\nintersection nodes or cycles of detachment and reattachment processes in the\ncrowded cytoplasm. In order to investigate the efficiency of search strategies\nestablished by the cell's specific spatial organization of the cytoskeleton we\nformulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. With\nextensive computer simulations we analyze the dependence of the mean first\npassage times for narrow escape problems on the structural characteristics of\nthe cytoskeleton, the motor properties and the fraction of time spent in each\nstate. We find that an inhomogeneous architecture with a small width of the\nactin cortex constitutes an efficient intracellular search strategy.\n", "  We study the photon detection efficiency and position resolution of the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter (EMC) of the BESIII detector. The control samples\nof the initial-state-radiation (ISR) process of $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\gamma\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ at $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi(3770)$ resonances are used for the\ncalibration of the photon cluster shapes and photon detection efficiency study.\nThe photon detection efficiency is defined as the fraction of predicted photon,\ndetermined by performing a kinematic fit with the four momenta of two charged\ntracks only, matched with the actual photons in the EMC. The spatial resolution\nof the EMC is studied in polar ($\\theta$) and azimuthal ($\\phi$) angle\ndirections in a cylindrical coordinate system centered at the interaction\npoint, with z-axis along the beam direction.\n", "  We review methods of data analysis for biophysical data with a special\nemphasis on single molecule applications. Our review is intended for anyone,\nfrom student to established researcher. For someone just getting started, we\nfocus on exposing the logic, strength and limitations of each method and cite,\nas appropriate, the relevant literature for implementation details. We review\ntraditional frequentist and Bayesian parametric approaches to data analysis and\nsubsequently extend our discussion to recent non-parametric and information\ntheoretic methods.\n", "  Simulations have been carried out to establish how electron thermal physics,\nintroduced in the form of a dynamic electron temperature, affects isolated\nfilament motion and dynamics in 3D. It is found that thermal effects impact\nfilament motion in two major ways when the filament has a significant\ntemperature perturbation compared to its density perturbation: They lead to a\nstrong increase in filament propagation in the bi-normal direction and a\nsignificant decrease in net radial propagation. Both effects arise from the\ntemperature dependence of the sheath current which leads to a non-uniform\nfloating potential, with the latter effect supplemented by faster pressure\nloss. The reduction in radial velocity can only occur when the filament\ncross-section loses angular symmetry. The behaviour is observed across\ndifferent filament sizes and suggests that filaments with much larger\ntemperature perturbations than density perturbations are more strongly confined\nto the near SOL region.\n", "  Young stars typically form in star clusters, so the supernovae (SNe) they\nproduce are clustered in space and time. This clustering of SNe may alter the\nmomentum per SN deposited in the interstellar medium (ISM) by affecting the\nlocal ISM density, which in turn affects the cooling rate. We study the effect\nof multiple SNe using idealized 1D hydrodynamic simulations which explore a\nlarge parameter space of the number of SNe, and the background gas density and\nmetallicity. The results are provided as a table and an analytic fitting\nformula. We find that for clusters with up to ~100 SNe the asymptotic momentum\nscales super-linearly with the number of SNe, resulting in a momentum per SN\nthat can be an order of magnitude larger than for a single SN, with a maximum\nefficiency for clusters with 10-100 SNe. We argue that additional physical\nprocesses not included in our simulations -- self-gravity, breakout from a\ngalactic disk, and galactic shear -- can slightly reduce the momentum\nenhancement from clustering, but the average momentum per SN still remains a\nfactor of 4 larger than the isolated SN value when averaged over a realistic\ncluster mass function for a star-forming galaxy. We conclude with a discussion\nof the possible role of mixing between hot and cold gas, induced by\nmulti-dimensional instabilities or preexisting density variations, as a\nlimiting factor in the buildup of momentum by clustered SNe, and suggest future\nnumerical experiments to explore these effects.\n", "  The auditory system displays remarkable sensitivity and frequency\ndiscrimination, attributes shown to rely on an amplification process that\ninvolves a mechanical as well as a biochemical response. Models that display\nproximity to an oscillatory onset (a.k.a. Hopf bifurcation) exhibit a resonant\nresponse to distinct frequencies of incoming sound, and can explain many\nfeatures of the amplification phenomenology. To understand the dynamics of this\nresonance, frequency locking is examined in a system near the Hopf bifurcation\nand subject to two types of driving forces: additive and parametric. Derivation\nof a universal amplitude equation that contains both forcing terms enables a\nstudy of their relative impact on the hair cell response. In the parametric\ncase, although the resonant solutions are 1:1 frequency locked, they show the\ncoexistence of solutions obeying a phase shift of $\\pi$, a feature typical of\nthe 2:1 resonance. Different characteristics are predicted for the transition\nfrom unlocked to locked solutions, leading to smooth or abrupt dynamics in\nresponse to different types of forcing. The theoretical framework provides a\nmore realistic model of the auditory system, which incorporates a direct\nmodulation of the internal control parameter by an applied drive. The results\npresented here can be generalized to many other media, including Faraday waves,\nchemical reactions, and nonlinear optics, which are known to exhibit resonant\nbehavior.\n", "  We show that the defects of graphene, which lead to the non-equality between\npositive curvature of fermions with anti-parallel spins and negative curvature\nof fermions with parallel spins, imply an emergence of F(R) gravity. By\nincreasing the number of atoms at each defect, the order of scalar curvature\nincreases and the shape of F(R) gravity changes. This gravity has a direct\nrelation with energy-momentum tensor and leads to motion of electrons in a\nspecial path and hence producing superconductivity. Also, for some special\nangles, parallel spins become close to each other and repel to each other. In\nthat condition, the shape of F(R) gravity changes and electrons can't continue\nto move in an initial path and return. Consequently, superconductivity\ndisappears and one new conductivity appears in opposite direction.\n", "  We demonstrate an exact equivalence between two widely used methods of\ncommunity detection in networks, the method of modularity maximization in its\ngeneralized form which incorporates a resolution parameter controlling the size\nof the communities discovered, and the method of maximum likelihood applied to\nthe special case of the stochastic block model known as the planted partition\nmodel, in which all communities in a network are assumed to have statistically\nsimilar properties. Among other things, this equivalence provides a\nmathematically principled derivation of the modularity function, clarifies the\nconditions and assumptions of its use, and gives an explicit formula for the\noptimal value of the resolution parameter.\n", "  The Rayleigh limit has so far applied to all microscopy techniques that rely\non linear optical interaction and detection in the far field. Here we\ndemonstrate that detecting the light emitted by an object in higher-order\ntransverse electromagnetic modes (TEMs) can help achieving sub-Rayleigh\nprecision for a variety of microscopy-related tasks. Using optical heterodyne\ndetection in TEM01, we measure the position of coherently and incoherently\nemitting objects to within 0.0015 and 0.012 of the Rayleigh limit,\nrespectively, and determine the distance between two incoherently emitting\nslits positioned within 0.28 of the Rayleigh limit with a precision of 0.019 of\nthe Rayleigh limit. Extending our technique to higher-order TEMs enables full\nimaging with resolution significantly below the Rayleigh limit in a way that is\nreminiscent of quantum tomography of optical states.\n", "  A theoretical framework is developed to clarify the relation between the\nprofiles of density and temperature in the Scrape Off Layer (SOL) with the\nfluctuations (filaments) that generate them. The framework is based on the\ndynamics of independent filaments and on their statistical behaviour and can be\nused to rigorously understand the mechanisms that lead to the non-exponential\nnature of the radial SOL profiles as well as the increase of the relative\nfluctuation amplitude in the far SOL. Several models for the dynamics of the\nfilaments, which can be applied to the framework, are derived and discussed for\nthe purpose of identifying how different assumptions lead to the emergence of\nfeatures in the profiles. It is found that multiple alternative models can\nexplain the observations, thus motivating more stringent and focused\nexperimental analysis. In particular, radially accelerating filaments, less\nefficient parallel exhaust and also a statistical distribution of the velocity\nof the filaments can all contribute to induce flatter profiles in the far SOL.\nA quite general result is the resiliency of the non-exponential nature of the\nprofiles. At the same time, several of the models discussed can also capture\nthe increase of the relative fluctuation amplitude observed in the far SOL. It\nis also shown that several scenarios are compatible with the broadening of the\nSOL, which could be caused by charge exchange interactions with neutral\nparticles or by a significant radial acceleration of the filaments.\n", "  We explore the method of using the measured jet activity associated with a\nhigh mass resonance state to determine the corresponding production modes. To\ndemonstrate the potential of the approach, we consider the case of a resonance\nof mass $M_R$ decaying to a diphoton final state. We perform a Monte Carlo\nstudy, considering three mass points $M_R=0.75,\\,1.5\\,,2.5$ TeV, and show that\nthe $\\gamma\\gamma$, $WW$, $gg$ and light and heavy $q\\overline{q}$ initiated\ncases lead to distinct predictions for the jet multiplicity distributions. As\nan example, we apply this result to the ATLAS search for resonances in diphoton\nevents, using the 2015 data set of $3.2\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.\nTaking the spin-0 selection, we demonstrate that a dominantly $gg$-initiated\nsignal hypothesis is mildly disfavoured, while the $\\gamma\\gamma$ and light\nquark cases give good descriptions within the limited statistics, and a\ndominantly $WW$-initiated hypothesis is found to be in strong tension with the\ndata. We also comment on the $b\\overline{b}$ initial state, which can already\nbe constrained by the measured $b$-jet multiplicity. Finally, we present\nexpected exclusion limits with integrated luminosity, and demonstrate that with\njust a few 10's of ${\\rm fb}^{-1}$ we can expect to constrain the production\nmodes of such a resonance.\n", "  We review some recent results on properties of tensor product and fusion\ncoefficients under complex conjugation of one of the factors. Some of these\nresults have been proven, some others are conjectures awaiting a proof, one of\nthem involving hitherto unnoticed observations on ordinary representation\ntheory of finite simple groups of Lie type\n", "  We investigate Kantowski-Sachs models in Einstein-{\\ae}ther theory with a\nperfect fluid source using the singularity analysis to prove the integrability\nof the field equations and dynamical system tools to study the evolution. We\nfind an inflationary source at early times, and an inflationary sink at late\ntimes, for a wide region in the parameter space. The results by A. A. Coley, G.\nLeon, P. Sandin and J. Latta (JCAP 12, 010, 2015), are then re-obtained as\nparticular cases. Additionally, we select other values for the non-GR\nparameters which are consistent with current constraints, getting a very rich\nphenomenology. In particular, we find solutions with infinite shear, zero\ncurvature, and infinite matter energy density in comparison with the Hubble\nscalar. We also have stiff-like future attractors, anisotropic late-time\nattractors, or both, in some special cases. Such results are developed\nanalytically, and then verified by numerics. Finally, the physical\ninterpretation of the new critical points is discussed.\n", "  In this paper we study the shape characteristics of a polymer chain in a good\nsolvent using a mesoscopic level of modelling. The dissipative particle\ndynamics simulations are performed in the $3D$ space at a range of chain\nlengths $N$. The scaling laws for the end-to-end distance and gyration radius\nare examined first and found to hold for $N\\geq 10$ yielding reasonably\naccurate value for the Flory exponent $\\nu$. Within the same interval of chain\nlengths, the asphericity, prolateness, size ratio and other shape\ncharacteristics of the chain are found to become independent of $N$. Their mean\nvalues are found to agree reasonably well with the respective theoretical\nresults and lattice Monte Carlo simulations. Broad probability distributions\nfor the shape characteristics are found resembling in form the results of\nlattice Monte Carlo simulations. By means of analytic fitting of these\ndistributions the most probable values for the shape characteristics are found\nto supplement their mean values.\n", "  The directional control of molecular dissociation with the laser electric\nfield waveform is a paradigm and was demonstrated for a variety of molecules.\nIn most cases, the directional control occurs via a dissociative ionization\npathway. The role of laser-induced coupling of electronic states in the\ndissociating ion versus selective ionization of oriented neutral molecules,\nhowever, could not be distinguished for even small heteronuclear molecules such\nas CO. Here, we introduce a technique, using elliptically polarized pump and\nlinearly polarized two-color probe pulses that unambiguously distinguishes the\nroles of laser-induced state coupling and selective ionization. The measured\nphotoelectron momentum distributions governed by the light polarizations allow\nus to coincidently identify the ionization and dissociation from the pump and\nprobe pulses. Directional dissociation of CO+ as a function of the relative\nphase of the linearly polarized two-color pulse is observed for both parallel\nand orthogonally oriented molecules. We find that the laser-induced coupling of\nvarious electronic states of CO+ plays an important role for the observed\ndirectional bond breaking, which is verified by quantum calculations.\n", "  The decay B+ to psi(2S) phi(1020) K+ is observed for the first time using\ndata collected from pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV by the CMS experiment at\nthe LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns.\nThe branching fraction of this decay is measured, using the mode B+ to psi(2S)\nK+ as normalization, to be (4.0 +/- 0.4 (stat) +/- 0.6 (syst) +/- 0.2 (B)) x\nE-6, where the third uncertainty is from the measured branching fraction of the\nnormalization channel.\n", "  Given that many fundamental questions in neuroscience are still open, it\nseems pertinent to explore whether the brain might use other physical\nmodalities than the ones that have been discovered so far. In particular it is\nwell established that neurons can emit photons, which prompts the question\nwhether these biophotons could serve as signals between neurons, in addition to\nthe well-known electro-chemical signals. For such communication to be targeted,\nthe photons would need to travel in waveguides. Here we show, based on detailed\ntheoretical modeling, that myelinated axons could serve as photonic waveguides,\ntaking into account realistic optical imperfections. We propose experiments,\nboth \\textit{in vivo} and \\textit{in vitro}, to test our hypothesis. We discuss\nthe implications of our results, including the question whether photons could\nmediate long-range quantum entanglement in the brain.\n", "  We study integrable models solvable by the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz and\ndescribed by $\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)$ or $\\mathfrak{gl}(1|2)$ superalgebras. We\nobtain explicit determinant representations for form factors of the monodromy\nmatrix entries. We show that all form factors are related to each other at\nspecial limits of the Bethe parameters. Our results allow one to obtain\ndeterminant formulas for form factors of local operators in the supersymmetric\nt-J model.\n", "  A new accurate method for reconstructing the arrival direction of an\nextensive air shower (EAS) is described. Compared to existing methods, it is\nnot subject to minimization of a function and, therefore, is fast and stable.\nThis method also does not need to know detailed curvature or thickness\nstructure of an EAS. It can have angular resolution of about 1 degree for a\ntypical surface array in central regions. Also, it has better angular\nresolution than other methods in the marginal area of arrays.\n", "  Quantitative tracking of features from video images is a basic technique\nemployed in many areas of science. Here, we present a method for the tracking\nof features that partially overlap, in order to be able to track so-called\ncolloidal molecules. Our approach implements two improvements into existing\nparticle tracking algorithms. Firstly, we use the history of previously\nidentified feature locations to successfully find their positions in\nconsecutive frames. Secondly, we present a framework for non-linear\nleast-squares fitting to summed radial model functions and analyze the accuracy\n(bias) and precision (random error) of the method on artificial data. We find\nthat our tracking algorithm correctly identifies overlapping features with an\naccuracy below 0.2% of the feature radius and a precision of 0.1 to 0.01 pixels\nfor a typical image of a colloidal cluster. Finally, we use our method to\nextract the three-dimensional diffusion tensor from the Brownian motion of\ncolloidal dimers.\n", "  We give exact integral expressions of the third cluster or virial\ncoefficients of binary mixtures of ideal Bose or Fermi gases, with interspecies\ninteractions of zero range and infinite s-wave scattering length. In general\nthe result depends on three-body parameters Rt appearing in three-body contact\nconditions, because an Efimov effect is present or because the mixture is in a\npreefimovian regime with a mass ratio close to an Efimov effect threshold. We\ngive a new, exact integral expression of Rt for the microscopic narrow Feshbach\nresonance model. A divergence of Rt in the preefimovian regime at a scaling\nexponent s = 1/2 is predicted and physically discussed. The analytical results\nare applied to typical species used in cold atom experiments.\n", "  Some time ago we have derived from the QCD Lagrangian an equation of state\n(EOS) for the cold quark matter, which can be considered an improved version of\nthe MIT bag model EOS. Compared to the latter, our equation of state reaches\nhigher values of the pressure at comparable baryon densities. This feature is\ndue to perturbative corrections and also to non-perturbative effects. Later we\napplied this EOS to the study of compact stars, discussing the absolute\nstability of quark matter and computing the mass-radius relation for self-bound\n(strange) stars. We found maximum masses of the sequences with more than two\nsolar masses, in agreement with the recent experimental observations. In the\npresent work we include the magnetic field in the equation of state and study\nhow it changes the stability conditions and the mass-radius curves.\n", "  We study the effects of low-energy electron beam irradiation up to 10 keV on\ngraphene based field effect transistors. We fabricate metallic bilayer\nelectrodes to contact mono- and bi-layer graphene flakes on SiO$_2$, obtaining\nspecific contact resistivity $\\rho_c \\simeq 19 k\\Omega \\mu m^2$ and carrier\nmobility as high as 4000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. By using a highly doped\np-Si/SiO$_2$ substrate as back gate, we analyze the transport properties of the\ndevice and the dependence on the pressure and on the electron bombardment. We\ndemonstrate that low energy irradiation is detrimental on the transistor\ncurrent capability, resulting in an increase of the contact resistance and a\nreduction of the carrier mobility even at electron doses as low as 30\n$e^-/nm^2$. We also show that the irradiated devices recover by returning to\ntheir pristine state after few repeated electrical measurements.\n", "  A search for neutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (MSSM) and for a heavy neutral $Z^{\\prime}$ boson is performed using a\ndata sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ from\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector\nat the LHC. The heavy resonance is assumed to decay to a $\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ pair\nwith at least one $\\tau$ lepton decaying to final states with hadrons and a\nneutrino. The search is performed in the mass range of 0.2--1.2 TeV for the\nMSSM neutral Higgs bosons and 0.5--2.5 TeV for the heavy neutral $Z^{\\prime}$\nboson. The data are in good agreement with the background predicted by the\nStandard Model and hence results are given as upper limits on the production\ncross section times branching fraction of the boson decay to $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ as\na function of the boson mass. The results are interpreted in MSSM and\n$Z^{\\prime}$ benchmark scenarios. The most stringent MSSM parameter space\nconstraints for the Higgs boson search exclude at 95\\% confidence level (CL)\n$\\tan\\beta > 7.6$ for $m_A = 200$ GeV in the $m_{h}^{\\textrm{mod+}}$ MSSM\nscenario. This analysis extends the MSSM limits from previous searches for the\nmass range $m_A > 500$ GeV. For the Sequential Standard Model, a\n$Z^{\\prime}_\\mathrm{SSM}$ mass up to 1.90 TeV is excluded at 95% CL and masses\nup to 1.82--2.17 TeV are excluded for a $Z^{\\prime}_{\\mathrm{SFM}}$ of the\nStrong Flavour Model.\n", "  The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) is a ton-scale\ncryogenic experiment designed to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay of\n$^{130}$Te and other rare events. The CUORE detector consists of 988 TeO$_2$\nbolometers operated underground at 10 mK in a dilution refrigerator at the\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Candidate events are identified through a\nprecise measurement of their energy. The absolute energy response of the\ndetectors is established by the regular calibration of each individual\nbolometer using gamma sources. The close-packed configuration of the CUORE\nbolometer array combined with the extensive shielding surrounding the detectors\nrequires the placement of calibration sources within the array itself. The\nCUORE Detector Calibration System is designed to insert radioactive sources\ninto and remove them from the cryostat while respecting the stringent heat\nload, radiopurity, and operational requirements of the experiment. This paper\ndescribes the design, commissioning, and performance of this novel source\ncalibration deployment system for ultra-low-temperature environments.\n", "  We apply molecular beam epitaxy to grow GeSn-nanoparticles on top of\nSi-nanopillars patterned onto p-type Si wafers. We use X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy to confirm a metallic behavior of the nanoparticle surface due to\npartial Sn segregation as well as the presence of a superficial Ge oxide. We\nreport the observation of stable field emission current from the\nGeSn-nanoparticles. We prove that field emission can be enhanced by preventing\nGeSn nanoparticles oxidation or by breaking the oxide layer through electrical\nstress. Finally, we show that GeSn/p-Si junctions have a rectifying behavior.\n", "  We present phonon dispersions, element-resolved vibrational density of states\n(VDOS) and corresponding thermodynamic properties obtained by a combination of\ndensity functional theory (DFT) and nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering\n(NRIXS) across the metamagnetic transition of B2 FeRh in the bulk material and\nthin epitaxial films. We see distinct differences in the VDOS of the\nantiferromagnetic (AF) and ferromagnetic (FM) phase which provide a microscopic\nproof of strong spin-phonon coupling in FeRh. The FM VDOS exhibits a particular\nsensitivity to the slight tetragonal distortions present in epitaxial films,\nwhich is not encountered in the AF phase. This results in a notable change in\nlattice entropy, which is important for the comparison between thin film and\nbulk results. Our calculations confirm the recently reported lattice\ninstability in the AF phase. The imaginary frequencies at the $X$-point depend\ncritically on the Fe magnetic moment and atomic volume. Analyzing these non\nvibrational modes leads to the discovery of a stable monoclinic ground state\nstructure which is robustly predicted from DFT but not verified in our thin\nfilm experiments. Specific heat, entropy and free energy calculated within the\nquasiharmonic approximation suggest that the new phase is possibly suppressed\nbecause of its relatively smaller lattice entropy. In the bulk phase, lattice\ndegrees of freedom contribute with the same sign and in similar magnitude to\nthe isostructural AF-FM phase transition as the electronic and magnetic\nsubsystems and therefore needs to be included in thermodynamic modeling.\n", "  We discuss R-parity violation (RPV) in semi-local and local F-theory\nconstructions. We first present a detailed analysis of all possible\ncombinations of RPV operators arising from semi-local F-theory spectral cover\nconstructions, assuming an $SU(5)$ GUT. We provide a classification of all\npossible allowed combinations of RPV operators originating from operators of\nthe form $10\\cdot \\bar 5\\cdot \\bar 5$, including the effect of $U(1)$ fluxes\nwith global restrictions. We then relax the global constraints and perform\nexplicit computations of the bottom/tau and RPV Yukawa couplings, at an\n$SO(12)$ local point of enhancement in the presence of general fluxes subject\nonly to local flux restrictions. We compare our results to the experimental\nlimits on each allowed RPV operator, and show that operators such as $LLe^c$,\n$LQd^c$ and $u^cd^cd^c$ may be present separately within current bounds,\npossibly on the edge of observability, suggesting lepton number violation or\nneutron-antineutron oscillations could constrain F-theory models.\n", "  R-matrix is explicitly constructed for simplest representations of the\nDing-Iohara-Miki algebra. The calculation is straightforward and significantly\nsimpler than the one through the universal R-matrix used for a similar\ncalculation in the Yangian case by A.~Smirnov but less general. We investigate\nthe interplay between the R-matrix structure and the structure of DIM algebra\nintertwiners, i.e.\\ of refined topological vertices and show that the R-matrix\nis diagonalized by the action of the spectral duality belonging to the SL(2,Z)\ngroup of DIM algebra automorphisms. We also construct the T-operators\nsatisfying the RTT relations with the R-matrix from refined amplitudes on\nresolved conifold. We thus show that topological string theories on the toric\nCalabi-Yau threefolds can be naturally interpreted as lattice integrable\nmodels. Integrals of motion for these systems are related to q-deformation of\nthe reflection matrices of the Liouville/Toda theories.\n", "  We present ALMA measurements of a merger shock using the thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal, at the location of a radio relic in the\nfamous El Gordo galaxy cluster at $z \\approx 0.9$. Multi-wavelength analysis in\ncombination with the archival Chandra data and a high-resolution radio image\nprovides a consistent picture of the thermal and non-thermal signal variation\nacross the shock front and helps to put robust constraints on the shock Mach\nnumber as well as the relic magnetic field. We employ a Bayesian analysis\ntechnique for modeling the SZ and X-ray data self-consistently, illustrating\nrespective parameter degeneracies. Combined results indicate a shock with Mach\nnumber ${\\cal M} = 2.4^{+1.3}_{-0.6}$, which in turn suggests a high value of\nthe magnetic field (of the order of $4-10 ~\\mu$G) to account for the observed\nrelic width at 2 GHz. At roughly half the current age of the universe, this is\nthe highest-redshift direct detection of a cluster shock to date, and one of\nthe first instances of an ALMA-SZ observation in a galaxy cluster. It shows the\ntremendous potential for future ALMA-SZ observations to detect merger shocks\nand other cluster substructures out to the highest redshifts.\n", "  The national space programs have an historic opportunity to help solve the\nglobal-scale economic and environmental problems of Earth while becoming more\neffective at science through the use of space resources. Space programs will be\nmore cost-effective when they work to establish a supply chain in space, mining\nand manufacturing then replicating the assets of the supply chain so it grows\nto larger capacity. This has become achievable because of advances in robotics\nand artificial intelligence. It is roughly estimated that developing a lunar\noutpost that relies upon and also develops the supply chain will cost about 1/3\nor less of the existing annual budgets of the national space programs. It will\nrequire a sustained commitment of several decades to complete, during which\ntime science and exploration become increasingly effective. At the end, this\nspace industry will capable of addressing global-scale challenges including\nlimited resources, clean energy, economic development, and preservation of the\nenvironment. Other potential solutions, including nuclear fusion and\nterrestrial renewable energy sources, do not address the root problem of our\nlimited globe and there are real questions whether they will be inadequate or\ntoo late. While industry in space likewise cannot provide perfect assurance, it\nis uniquely able to solve the root problem, and it gives us an important chance\nthat we should grasp. What makes this such an historic opportunity is that the\nspace-based solution is obtainable as a side-benefit of doing space science and\nexploration within their existing budgets. Thinking pragmatically, it may take\nsome time for policymakers to agree that setting up a complete supply chain is\nan achievable goal, so this paper describes a strategy of incremental progress.\n", "  Virial shocks at edges of cosmic-web structures are a clear prediction of\nstandard structure formation theories. We derive a criterion for the stability\nof the post-shock gas and of the virial shock itself in spherical, filamentary\nand planar infall geometries. When gas cooling is important, we find that\nshocks become unstable, and gas flows uninterrupted towards the center of the\nrespective halo, filament or sheet. For filaments, we impose this criterion on\nself-similar infall solutions. We find that instability is expected for\nfilament masses between $10^{11}-10^{13}M_\\odot Mpc^{-1}.$ Using a simplified\ntoy model, we then show that these filaments will likely feed halos with\n$10^{10}M_{\\odot}\\lesssim M_{halo}\\lesssim 10^{13}M_{\\odot}$ at redshift $z=3$,\nas well as $10^{12}M_{\\odot}\\lesssim M_{halo}\\lesssim 10^{15}M_{\\odot}$ at\n$z=0$.\n  The instability will affect the survivability of the filaments as they\npenetrate gaseous halos in a non-trivial way. Additionally, smaller halos\naccreting onto non-stable filaments will not be subject to ram-pressure inside\nthe filaments. The instreaming gas will continue towards the center, and stop\neither once its angular momentum balances the gravitational attraction, or when\nits density becomes so high that it becomes self-shielded to radiation.\n", "  Unlike the one-loop QG divergences in D=4, which can all be transformed away,\nthose in arbitrary higher (even) dimension cannot.\n", "  We report a novel scheme for the generation of dense clusters of Raman\nsidebands. The scheme uses a broadband-guiding hollow-core photonic crystal\nfiber (HC-PCF) filled with a mixture of H2, D2, and Xe for efficient\ninteraction between the gas mixture and a green laser pump pulse (532 nm, 1 ns)\nof only 5 uJ energy. This results in the generation from noise of more than 135\nro-vibrational Raman sidebands covering the visible spectral region with an\naverage spacing of only 2 THz. Such a spectrally dense and compact fiber-based\nsource is ideal for applications where closely spaced narrow-band laser lines\nwith high spectral power density are required, such as in spectroscopy and\nsensing. When the HC-PCF is filled with a H2-D2 mixture the Raman comb spans\nthe spectral region from the deep UV (280 nm) to the near infrared (1000 nm).\n", "  We revisit the viable parameter space in No-Scale ${\\cal F}$-$SU(5)$,\nexamining the Grand Unified Theory within the context of the prevailing gluino\nmass limits established by the LHC. The satisfaction of both the No-Scale\nboundary condition and the experimentally measured Standard Model (SM) like\nHiggs boson mass requires a lower limit on the gluino mass in the model space\nof about 1.9 TeV, which maybe not coincidentally is the current LHC\nsupersymmetry search bound. This offers a plausible explanation as to why a\nsupersymmetry signal has thus far not been observed at the LHC. On the\ncontrary, since the vector-like flippon particles are relatively heavy due to\nthe strict condition that the supersymmetry breaking soft term $B_{\\mu}$ must\nvanish at the unification scale, we also cannot address the recently vanished\n750 GeV diphoton resonance at the 13 TeV LHC. Therefore, No-Scale ${\\cal\nF}$-$SU(5)$ returns as a King after the spurious 750 GeV diphoton excess was\ngone with the wind.\n", "  We report a first measurement for ultra-high energy cosmic rays of the\ncorrelation between the depth of shower maximum and the signal in the water\nCherenkov stations of air-showers registered simultaneously by the fluorescence\nand the surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Such a correlation\nmeasurement is a unique feature of a hybrid air-shower observatory with\nsensitivity to both the electromagnetic and muonic components. It allows an\naccurate determination of the spread of primary masses in the cosmic-ray flux.\nUp till now, constraints on the spread of primary masses have been dominated by\nsystematic uncertainties. The present correlation measurement is not affected\nby systematics in the measurement of the depth of shower maximum or the signal\nin the water Cherenkov stations. The analysis relies on general characteristics\nof air showers and is thus robust also with respect to uncertainties in\nhadronic event generators. The observed correlation in the energy range around\nthe `ankle' at $\\lg(E/{\\rm eV})=18.5-19.0$ differs significantly from\nexpectations for pure primary cosmic-ray compositions. A light composition made\nup of proton and helium only is equally inconsistent with observations. The\ndata are explained well by a mixed composition including nuclei with mass $A >\n4$. Scenarios such as the proton dip model, with almost pure compositions, are\nthus disfavoured as the sole explanation of the ultrahigh-energy cosmic-ray\nflux at Earth.\n", "  Cosmological $N$-body simulations are the standard tool to study the\nemergence of the observed large-scale structure of the Universe. Such\nsimulations usually solve for the gravitational dynamics of matter within the\nNewtonian approximation, thus discarding general relativistic effects such as\nthe coupling between matter and radiation ($\\equiv$ photons and neutrinos). In\nthis paper we investigate novel hybrid simulations which incorporate\ninteractions between radiation and matter to the leading order in General\nRelativity, whilst evolving the matter dynamics in full non-linearity according\nto Newtonian theory. Our hybrid simulations come with a relativistic space-time\nand make it possible to investigate structure formation in a unified framework.\nIn the present work we focus on simulations initialized at $z=99$, and show\nthat the extracted matter power spectrum receives up to $3\\%$ corrections on\nvery large scales through radiation. Our numerical findings compare favourably\nwith linear analytical results from Fidler et al. (2016), from which we deduce\nthat there cannot be any significant non-linear mode-coupling induced through\nlinear radiation corrections.\n", "  The lack of detailed balance in active colloidal suspensions allows\ndissipation to determine stationary states. Here we show that slow viscous flow\nproduced by polar or apolar active colloids near plane walls mediates\nattractive hydrodynamic forces that drive crystallization. Hydrodynamically\nmediated torques tend to destabilize the crystal but stability can be regained\nthrough critical amounts of bottom-heaviness or chiral activity. Numerical\nsimulations show that crystallization is not nucleational, as in equilibrium,\nbut is preceded by a spinodal-like instability. Harmonic excitations of the\nactive crystal relax diffusively but the normal modes are distinct from an\nequilibrium colloidal crystal. The hydrodynamic mechanisms presented here are\nuniversal and rationalize recent experiments on the crystallization of active\ncolloids.\n", "  We use variable-temperature x-ray thermal diffuse scattering and inelastic\nscattering to investigate the lattice dynamics in single crystals of\nmultiferroic CaMn7O12 which undergo a series of orbital and magnetic\ntransitions at low temperatures. Upon approaching the charge and orbital\nordering temperature To=250 K from above, we observe intense diffuse scattering\nfeatures and a pronounced optical phonon softening centered around the\nsuperstructure reflections of the incommensurately modulated structure. The\nphonon anomaly appears well above To and continuously increases upon cooling,\nfollowing a canonical power-law temperature dependence that confirms the\ntransition at To to be of second order and related to a soft-phonon lattice\ninstability. Microscopic mechanisms for the incommensurate charge and orbital\nordering based on competing interactions and on momentum dependent\nelectron-phonon coupling could both account for the observed extended momentum\nwidth of the phonon softening. Our results highlight the importance of the\nlattice interactions in the physics of this magnetically induced ferroelectric\nsystem.\n", "  We studied the critical dynamics of spectral singularities. The system\ninvestigated is a coupled resonator array with a side-coupled loss (gain)\nresonator. For a gain resonator, the system acts as a wave emitter at spectral\nsingularities. The reflection probability increased linearly over time. The\nrate of increase is proportional to the width of the incident wave packet,\nwhich served as the spectral singularity observer in the experiment. For a\nlossy resonator, the system acts as a wave absorber. The emission and\nabsorption states at spectral singularities coalesce in a finite parity-time\n(PT ) symmetric system that combined by the gain and loss structures cut from\ncorrresponding scattering systems at spectral singularities; in this case, the\nPT -symmetric system is at an exceptional point with a 2 * 2 Jordan block. The\ndynamics of the PT -symmetric system exhibit the characteristic of exceptional\npoints and spectral singularities.\n", "  We consider the production of $W$ and $Z / \\gamma^{*}$ gauge bosons in\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 510\n\\mbox{GeV}$ available at RHIC at BNL, operating at high luminosity. We stress\nthe importance of measuring the transverse double-spin asymmetries $A_{TT}$, in\nconnection with available transversely polarized beams with a high degree of\npolarisation. We will discuss some theoretical issues related to the predicted\nasymmetries. These studies are contrasted to the 2017 RHIC running operation of\ntransversely polarized beams of mid-rapidity $W$ and $Z$ boson production at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=510\\,$GeV along with long-term prospects\nbeyond 2020 at RHIC.\n", "  We investigate the optical transmission spectra for $s$-polarized (TE) and\n$p$-polarized (TM) waves in one-dimensional photonic quasicrystals on a\nquasiperiodic multilayer structure made up by alternate layers of SiO$_{2}$ and\n\\textit{metamaterials}, organized by following the Octonacci sequence.\nMaxwell's equations and the transfer-matrix technique are used to derive the\ntransmission spectra for the propagation of normaly and obliquely incident\noptical fields. We assume Drude-Lorentz-type dispersive response for the\ndielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the metamaterials. For\nnormally incident waves, we observe that the spectra does not have self-similar\nbehavior or mirror symmetry and it also features the absence of optical band\ngap. Also for normally incident waves, we show regions of full transmittance\nwhen the incident angle $\\theta_{C} = 0^{\\circ}$ in a particular frequency\nrange.\n", "  Bulk toroidal rotation has proven capable of stabilising both dangerous MHD\nmodes and turbulence. In this thesis, we explore a method to drive rotation in\nlarge tokamaks: up-down asymmetry in the magnetic equilibrium. We seek to\nmaximise this rotation by finding optimal up-down asymmetric flux surface\nshapes.\n  First, we use the ideal MHD model to show that low order external shaping\n(e.g. elongation) is best for creating up-down asymmetric flux surfaces\nthroughout the device. Then, we calculate realistic up-down asymmetric\nequilibria for input into nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence analysis. Analytic\ngyrokinetics shows that, in the limit of fast shaping effects, a poloidal tilt\nof the flux surface shaping has little effect on turbulent transport. Since\nup-down symmetric surfaces do not transport momentum, this invariance to tilt\nimplies that devices with mirror symmetry about any line in the poloidal plane\nwill drive minimal rotation. Accordingly, further analytic investigation\nsuggests that non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces with envelopes created by the\nbeating of fast shaping effects may create significantly stronger momentum\ntransport.\n  Guided by these analytic results, we carry out local nonlinear gyrokinetic\nsimulations of non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces created with the lowest\npossible shaping effects. First, we consider tilted elliptical flux surfaces\nwith a Shafranov shift and find little increase in the momentum transport when\nthe effect of the pressure profile on the equilibrium is included. We then\nsimulate flux surfaces with independently-tilted elongation and triangularity.\nThese two-mode configurations show a $60\\%$ increase over configurations with\njust elongation or triangularity. A rough analytic estimate indicates that the\noptimal two-mode configuration can drive rotation with an on-axis Alfven Mach\nnumber of $1.5 \\%$ in an ITER-like machine.\n", "  Under suitable scaling, the structure of self-gravitating polytropes is\ndescribed by the standard Lane-Emden equation (LEE), which is characterised by\nthe polytropic index $n$. Here we use the known exact solutions of the LEE at\n$n=0$ and $1$ to solve the equation perturbatively. We first introduce a scaled\nLEE (SLEE) where polytropes with different polytropic indices all share a\ncommon scaled radius. The SLEE is then solved perturbatively as an eigenvalue\nproblem. Analytical approximants of the polytrope function, the radius and the\nmass of polytropes as a function of $n$ are derived. The approximant of the\npolytrope function is well-defined and uniformly accurate from the origin down\nto the surface of a polytrope. The percentage errors of the radius and the mass\nare bounded by $8.1 \\times 10^{-7}$ per cent and $8.5 \\times 10^{-5}$ per cent,\nrespectively, for $n\\in[0,1]$. Even for $n\\in[1,5)$, both percentage errors are\nstill less than $2$ per cent.\n", "  Numerical simulations of merging black hole binaries produce the most\naccurate gravitational waveforms. The availability of hundreds of these\nnumerical relativity (NR) waveforms, often containing many higher spherical\nharmonic modes, allows one to study many aspects of gravitational waves.\nAmongst these are the response of data analysis pipelines, the calibration of\nsemi-analytical models, the building of reduced-order surrogates, the\nestimation of the parameters of detected gravitational waves, and the\ncomposition of public catalogs of NR waveform data. The large number of\ngenerated NR waveforms consequently requires efficient data storage and\nhandling, especially since many more waveforms will be generated at an\nincreased rate in the forthcoming years. In addition, gravitational wave data\nanalyses often require the NR waveforms to be interpolated and uniformly\nresampled at high sampling rates. Previously, this resulted in very large data\nfiles (up to $\\sim$ several GB) in memory-intensive operations, which is\nunfeasible when confronted with hundreds of multi-modal NR waveforms. To handle\nthese challenges, we present a simple and efficient method to significantly\n\\emph{compress} the original waveform data sets while accurately reproducing\nthe original data via spline interpolation. The method is generically\napplicable to relatively smooth, one-dimensional datasets and uses a greedy\nalgorithm to determine the most relevant subset of the full data such that a\nspline interpolant of a specified polynomial degree will represent the original\ndata to within a requested point-wise tolerance. We find significant\ncompression of the original NR data sets presented here. These compressed data\nsets can then be evaluated fast and efficiently and resampled as desired.\n", "  In the first part of this article, given the intent to stay at a popular\nlevel, it has been introduced and explained briefly basic concepts of\nEinstein's General Relativity, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, String Theory, Quantum\nGravity and Extended Theories of Gravity. The core of this research is based on\nselecting a class of f(R) theories of gravity, which exhibits scale factor\nduality transformations. The starting point of this theory is the effective\ntheory of gravity derived from Bosonic String Theory, which is called tree\nlevel effective theory of gravity. It is shown that this theory can be cast in\na class of f(R) theories of gravity (modified theories of Einstein's General\nRelativity). It is imposed that FLRW metric be solution of this class of $f(R)$\ntheories, and, using the Noether symmetry approach, it is found that the\ncosmological model has scale factor duality like the Pre-Big Bang cosmology of\nGasperini and Veneziano.\n", "  We develop and apply several strategies for setting physical parameters on\nquantum annealers for application problems that do not fit natively on the\nhardware graph. The strategies are tested with a culled random set of mixed\nsatisfiability problems, yielding results that generalize to guidelines\nregarding which parameter setting strategies to use for different classes of\nproblems, and how to choose other necessary hardware quantities as well.\nAlternate methods of changing the hardware implementation of an application\nproblem are also considered and their utility discussed.\n", "  It is shown that tunneling rates can be defined in terms of a false-vacuum\neffective action whose reality and convexity properties differ from those of\nthe corresponding groundstate functional. The tunneling rate is directly\nrelated to the false-vacuum effective action evaluated at an extremal \"quantum\nbounce\". The Nielsen identities of the false-vacuum functional ensure that the\nrate remains independent of the choice of gauge-fixing. Our results are\nnonperturbative and clarify issues related with convexity and radiative\ncorrections.\n", "  We give a pedagogical introduction of the stochastic variational method by\nconsidering the quantization of a non-inertial particle system. We show that\nthe effects of fictitious forces are represented in the forms of vector fields\nwhich behave analogous to the gauge fields in the electromagnetic interaction.\nWe further discuss that the operator expressions for observables can be defined\nby applying the stochastic Noether theorem.\n", "  We derive constraints on the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos with the\nSM fields in the most general Seesaw scenario where the heavy neutrinos are\nintegrated out. Among the electroweak and flavour observables included in the\nglobal fit, $\\mu\\rightarrow e\\gamma$ sets the present strongest bound on the\nadditional neutrino mixing, while in the future it will be dominated by $\\mu-e$\nconversion in nuclei. Increasing its sensitivity in future experiments could\nprobe Non-Unitarity in Lepton Flavour Violating processes. Nevertheless, in\norder to determine completely model-independent constraints, we provide a\nsecond set of bounds derived through a global fit that does not include LFV\nobservables. These indirect constraints on the off-diagonal elements come from\nthe diagonal bounds through the Schwarz inequality.\n", "  We investigate the integrability conditions of a class of shear-free\nperfect-fluid cosmological models within the framework of anisotropic fluid\nsources, applying our results to f(R) dark energy models. Generalising earlier\ngeneral relativistic results for time-like geodesics, we extend the potential\nand acceleration terms of the quasi-Newtonian formulation of integrable dust\ncosmological models about a linearized Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nbackground and derive the equations that describe their dynamical evolutions.\nWe show that in general, models with an anisotropic fluid source are not\nconsistent, but because of the particular form the anisotropic stress takes in\nf(R) gravity, the general integrability conditions, in this case, are\nsatisfied.\n", "  By using direct numerical simulations (DNS) at unprecedented resolution we\nstudy turbulence under rotation in the presence of simultaneous direct and\ninverse cascades. The accumulation of energy at large scale leads to the\nformation of vertical coherent regions with high vorticity oriented along the\nrotation axis. By seeding the flow with millions of inertial particles, we\nquantify -for the first time- the effects of those coherent vertical structures\non the preferential concentration of light and heavy particles. Furthermore, we\nquantitatively show that extreme fluctuations, leading to deviations from a\nnormal-distributed statistics, result from the entangled interaction of the\nvertical structures with the turbulent background. Finally, we present the\nfirst-ever measurement of the relative importance between Stokes drag, Coriolis\nforce and centripetal forces along the trajectories of inertial particles. We\ndiscover that vortical coherent structures lead to unexpected diffusion\nproperties for heavy and light particles in the directions parallel and\nperpendicular to the rotation axis.\n", "  We present a spectropolarimetric snapshot survey of solar-type planet hosting\nstars. In addition to 14 planet-hosting stars observed as part of the BCool\nmagnetic snapshot survey, we obtained magnetic observations of a further 19\nplanet-hosting solar-type stars in order to see if the presence of close-in\nplanets had an effect on the measured surface magnetic field (|B$_{\\ell}$|).\nOur results indicate that the magnetic activity of this sample is congruent\nwith that of the overall BCool sample. The effects of the planetary systems on\nthe magnetic activity of the parent star, if any, are too subtle to detect\ncompared to the intrinsic dispersion and correlations with rotation, age and\nstellar activity proxies in our sample. Four of the 19 newly observed stars,\ntwo of which are subgiants, have unambiguously detected magnetic fields and are\nfuture targets for Zeeman Doppler Mapping.\n", "  The Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) equation has proved valuable in describing\nthe motion of radiating electric charges but suffers from runaway,\npre-acceleration and other ambiguities. The usual scheme is problematic because\nof locality, which leads to self-interaction with the propagating radiation\n(i.e. real photons). Instead, the present heuristic model relies on an\ninfinitesimal time delay between the action of external forces and the inertial\nreaction by the charge. This yields a new and pathology-free equation of motion\nwhereas the radiated energy-momentum is expressed as an infinite series that\ngeneralises Larmor's formula and leads to testable predictions using current\nand near future ultra-intense lasers. The time-delay hypothesis is to be put in\nparallel with recently observed delays of order $10^{-18}$s (attosecond) in\nphotoemission by atoms and small molecules. Such behaviour is extended here to\nelementary charges which are supposed to exhibit delays given by the time taken\nby light to cross the charge's classical radius, which gives $\\approx\n10^{-23}$s for an electron.\n", "  We propose a novel stochastic method to generate Brownian paths conditioned\nto start at an initial point and end at a given final point during a fixed time\n$t_{f}$ under a given potential $U(x)$. These paths are sampled with a\nprobability given by the overdamped Langevin dynamics. We show that these paths\ncan be exactly generated by a local Stochastic Partial Differential Equation\n(SPDE). This equation cannot be solved in general. We present several\napproximations that are valid either in the low temperature regime or in the\npresence of barrier crossing. We show that this method warrants the generation\nof statistically independent transition paths. It is computationally very\nefficient. We illustrate the method on the two dimensional Mueller potential as\nwell as on the Mexican hat potential.\n", "  We develop a new class of random-graph models for the statistical estimation\nof network formation that allow for substantial correlation in links. Various\nsubgraphs (e.g., links, triangles, cliques, stars) are generated and their\nunion results in a network. We provide estimation techniques for recovering the\nrates at which the underlying subgraphs were formed. We illustrate the models\nvia a series of applications including testing for incentives to form\ncross-caste relationships in rural India, testing to see whether network\nstructure is used to enforce risk-sharing, testing as to whether networks\nchange in response to a community's exposure to microcredit, and show that\nthese models significantly outperform stochastic block models in matching\nobserved network characteristics. We also establish asymptotic properties of\nthe models and various estimators, which requires proving a new Central Limit\nTheorem for correlated random variables.\n", "  In December 2010, a major storm erupted in Saturn's northern hemisphere near\n37 degree planetographic latitude. This rather surprising event, occurring at\nan unexpected latitude and time, is the sixth \"Great White Spot\" (GWS) storm\nobserved over the last century and a half. Such GWS events are planetary-scale\natmospheric phenomena that dramatically change the typically bland appearance\nof the planet. Occurring while the Cassini mission was on-orbit at Saturn, the\nGreat Storm of 2010-2011 was well-suited for intense scrutiny by the suite of\nsophisticated instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft as well by modern\ninstrumentation on ground-based telescopes and onboard the Hubble Space\nTelescope. This GWS erupted on December 5th and generated a major dynamical\ndisturbance that affected the whole latitude band from 25 deg to 48 deg N.\nLightning events were prominent and detected as outbursts and flashes at both\noptical and radio wavelengths. The activity of the head ceased after about\nseven months, leaving the cloud structure and ambient winds perturbed. The tops\nof the optically dense clouds of the storm's head reached the 300 mbar altitude\nlevel where a mixture of ices was detected. The energetics of the frequency and\npower of lightning, as well as the estimated power generated by the latent heat\nreleased in the water-based convection, both indicate that the power released\nfor the storm was a significant fraction of Saturn's total radiated power. The\neffects of the storm propagated into the stratosphere forming two warm\nairmasses at the 0.5-5 mbar pressure level altitude. Related to the\nstratospheric disturbance, hydrocarbon composition excesses were found. The\ndecades-long interval between storms is probably related to the insolation\ncycle and the long radiative time constant of Saturn's atmosphere, and several\ntheories for temporarily storing energy have been proposed.\n", "  Since the beginning of quantum mechanics, many puzzling phenomena which\ndistinguish the quantum from the classical world, have appeared such as\ncomplementarity, entanglement or contextuality. All of these phenomena are\nbased on the existence of non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics.\nFurthermore, theses effects generate advantages which allow quantum\ntechnologies to surpass classical technologies.\n  In this lecture note, we investigate two prominent examples of these\nphenomenons: complementarity and entanglement. We discuss some of their basic\nproperties and introduce general methods for their experimental investigation.\nIn this way, we find many connections between the investigation of\ncomplementarity and entanglement. One of these connections is given by the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality which helps to formulate quantitative measurement\nprocedures to observe complementarity as well as entanglement.\n", "  We study the rotational motion of nano-flake ferromagnetic discs suspended in\na Newtonian fluid, as a potential material owing the vortex-like magnetic\nconfiguration. Using analytical expressions for hydrodynamic, magnetic and\nBrownian torques, the stochastic angular momentum equation is determined in the\ndilute limit conditions under applied magnetic field. Results are compared\nagainst experimental ones and excellent agreement is observed. We also estimate\nthe uncertainty in the orientation of the discs due to the Brownian torque when\nan external magnetic field aligns them. Interestingly, this uncertainty is\nroughly proportional to the ratio of thermal energy of fluid to the magnetic\nenergy stored in the discs. Our approach can be implemented in many practical\napplications including biotechnology and multi-functional fluidics.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) boron monolayers have been successfully synthesized on\nsilver substrate very recently. Their potential application is thus of great\nsignificance. In this work, we explore the possibility of boron monolayers\n(BMs) as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by\nfirst-principle method. Our calculations show that the BMs are active catalysts\nfor HER with nearly zero free energy of hydrogen adsorption, metallic\nconductivity and plenty of active sites in the basal plane. The effect of the\nsubstrate on the HER activity is further assessed. It is found that the\nsubstrate has a positive effect on the HER performance caused by the\ncompetitive effect of mismatch strain and charge transfer. The indepth\nunderstanding of the structure dependent HER activity is also provided.\n", "  Water ice covers the surface of various objects in the outer Solar system.\nWithin the heliopause, surface ice is constantly bombarded and sputtered by\nenergetic particles from the solar wind and magnetospheres. We report a\nlaboratory investigation of the sputtering yield of water ice when irradiated\nat 10 K by 4 keV singly (13C+, N+, O+, Ar+) and doubly charged ions (13C2+,\nN2+, O2+). The experimental values for the sputtering yields are in good\nagreement with the prediction of a theoretical model. There is no significant\ndifference in the yield for singly and doubly charged ions. Using these yields,\nwe estimate the rate of water ice erosion in the outer Solar system objects due\nto solar wind sputtering. Temperature-programmed desorption of the ice after\nirradiation with 13C+ and 13C2+ demonstrated the formation of 13CO and 13CO2,\nwith 13CO being the dominant formed species.\n", "  The time-window for processing electron spin information (spintronics) in\nsolid-state quantum electronic devices is determined by the spin-lattice (T1)\nand spin-spin (T2) relaxation times of electrons. Minimising the effects of\nspin-orbit coupling and the local magnetic contributions of neighbouring atoms\non T1 and T2 at room temperature remain substantial challenges to practical\nspintronics. Here, we report a record-high conduction electron T1=T2 of 175 ns\nat 300 K in 37 nm +/- 7 nm carbon spheres, which exceeds by far the highest\nvalues observed for any conducting solid state material of comparable size. The\nlong T1=T2 is due to quantum confinement effects, to the intrinsically weak\nspin-orbit coupling of carbon, and to the protecting nature of the outer shells\nof the inner spins from the influences of environmental disturbances. Following\nthe observation of spin polarization by electron spin resonance, we controlled\nthe quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of an\noscillating magnetic field and observed coherent oscillations of the spin\nstate. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating electron spins in\nconducting carbon nanospheres as quantum bits at room temperature.\n", "  We consider multilinear generalization of the Hirota derivative, which serves\nas a building block for integrable solitonic hierarchies. 2 special integrable\nmutlilinear equations are shown to be splittable into pairs of bilinear\noperators, parametrized by the additional variable. This fact is a signature of\na higher (B)KP reductions.\n", "  Electric resistance in conducting media is related to heat (or entropy)\nproduction in presence of electric fields. In this paper, by using Araki's\nrelative entropy for states, we mathematically define and analyze the heat\nproduction of free fermions within external potentials. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the heat production of the non-autonomous C*-dynamical system\nobtained from the fermionic second quantization of a discrete Schr\\\"odinger\noperator with bounded static potential in presence of an electric field that is\ntime- and space-dependent. It is a first preliminary step towards a\nmathematical description of transport properties of fermions from thermal\nconsiderations. This program will be carried out in several papers. The regime\nof small and slowly varying in space electric fields is important in this\ncontext, and is studied the present paper. We use tree-decay bounds of the\n$n$-point, $n\\in 2\\mathbb{N}$, correlations of the many-fermion system to\nanalyze this regime. We verify below the 1st law of thermodynamics for the\nsystem under consideration. The latter implies, for systems doing no work, that\nthe heat produced by the electromagnetic field is exactly the increase of the\ninternal energy resulting from the modification of the (infinite volume) state\nof the fermion system. The identification of heat production with an energy\nincrement is, among other things, technically convenient. We initially focus\nour study on non-interacting (or free) fermions, but our approach will be later\napplied to weakly interacting fermions.\n", "  We study the effects of vertical sinusoidal vibrations on a liquid droplet\nwith a low surface tension (ethanol) deposited on a solid substrate. In a\nprecise range of amplitudes and frequencies, the drop exhibits a dramatic\nworm-like shape instability with a strong symmetry breaking, comparable to the\none observed by Pucci et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., 106 (2011) 024503) on a\nvibrated floating lens. However, the geometry of our system is much simpler\nsince it does not involve the oscillation and deformation of a\nliquid-liquid-air contact line. We show that the Faraday waves appearing on the\nsurface of the droplet control its shape and we draw a systematic phase diagram\nof the instability. A simple theoretical model allows us to derive a relation\nbetween the elongation of the droplet and the amplitude of the Faraday wave, in\ngood agreement with measurements of both quantities.\n", "  The random laser action with coherent feedback by second-harmonic generation\n(SHG) was experimentally demonstrated in this paper. Compared with the\nconventional random laser action based on photoluminescence effect, which needs\nstrong photoresponse in the active medium and has a fixed response waveband due\nto the inherent energy level structure of the material, this random SHG laser\naction indicates a possible confinement of the nonlinear signal with ring\ncavities and widens the response waveband due to the flexible frequency\nconversion in nonlinear process. The combination of coherent random laser and\nnonlinear optics will provide us another possible way to break phase-matching\nlimitations, with fiber or feedback-based wavefront shaping method to transmit\nthe emission signal directionally. This work suggests potential applications in\nband-tunable random laser, phase-matching-free nonlinear optics and even brings\nin new consideration about random nonlinear optics (RNO).\n", "  We demonstrated recently that polyelectrolytes with cationic moieties along\nthe chain and a single anionic head are able to form physical hydrogels due to\nthe reversible nature of the head-to-body ionic bond. Here we generate a\nvariety of such polyelectrolytes with various cationic moieties and counterion\ncombinations starting from a common polymeric platform. We show that the\nrheological properties (shear modulus, critical strain) of the final hydrogels\ncan be modulated over three orders of magnitude depending on the cation/anion\npair. Our data fit remarkably well within a scaling model involving a\nsupramolecular head-to-tail single file between cross-links, akin to the\nbehaviour of pine-processionary caterpillar. This model allows the quantitative\nmeasure of the amount of counterion condensation from standard rheology\nprocedure.\n", "  We consider free lattice fermions subjected to a static bounded potential and\na time- and space-dependent electric field. For any bounded convex region\n$\\mathcal{R}\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ ($d\\geq 1$) of space, electric fields\n$\\mathcal{E}$ within $\\mathcal{R}$ drive currents. At leading order, uniformly\nwith respect to the volume $\\left| \\mathcal{R}\\right| $ of $\\mathcal{R}$ and\nthe particular choice of the static potential, the dependency on $\\mathcal{E}$\nof the current is linear and described by a conductivity distribution. Because\nof the positivity of the heat production, the real part of its Fourier\ntransform is a positive measure, named here (microscopic) conductivity measure\nof $\\mathcal{R}$, in accordance with Ohm's law in Fourier space. This finite\nmeasure is the Fourier transform of a time-correlation function of current\nfluctuations, i.e., the conductivity distribution satisfies Green-Kubo\nrelations. We additionally show that this measure can also be seen as the\nboundary value of the Laplace-Fourier transform of a so-called quantum current\nviscosity. The real and imaginary parts of conductivity distributions satisfy\nKramers-Kronig relations. At leading order, uniformly with respect to\nparameters, the heat production is the classical work performed by electric\nfields on the system in presence of currents. The conductivity measure is\nuniformly bounded with respect to parameters of the system and it is never the\ntrivial measure $0\\,\\mathrm{d}\\nu $. Therefore, electric fields generally\nproduce heat in such systems. In fact, the conductivity measure defines a\nquadratic form in the space of Schwartz functions, the Legendre-Fenchel\ntransform of which describes the resistivity of the system. This leads to\nJoule's law, i.e., the heat produced by currents is proportional to the\nresistivity and the square of currents.\n", "  We present DOHA, a new algorithm for cotrending photometric light curves\nobtained by transiting exoplanet surveys. The algorithm employs a novel\napproach to the traditional \"differential photometry\" technique, by selecting\nthe most suitable comparison star for each target light curve, using a two-step\ncorrelation search. Extensive tests on real data reveal that DOHA corrects both\nintra-night variations and long-term systematics affecting the data.\nStatistical studies conducted on a sample of 9500 light curves from the Qatar\nExoplanet Survey reveal that DOHA-corrected light curves show an RMS\nimprovement of a factor of 2, compared to the raw light curves. In addition, we\nshow that the transit detection probability in our sample can increase\nconsiderably, even up to a factor of 7, after applying DOHA.\n", "  We report a study of the strain state of epitaxial MnSi films on Si(111)\nsubstrates in the thick film limit (100-500~\\AA) as a function of film\nthickness using polarization-dependent extended x-ray absorption fine structure\n(EXAFS). All films investigated are phase-pure and of high quality with a sharp\ninterface between MnSi and Si. The investigated MnSi films are in a thickness\nregime where the magnetic transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ assumes a\nthickness-independent enhanced value of $\\geq$43~K as compared with that of\nbulk MnSi, where $T_\\mathrm{c} \\approx 29~{\\rm K}$. A detailed refinement of\nthe EXAFS data reveals that the Mn positions are unchanged, whereas the Si\npositions vary along the out-of-plane [111]-direction, alternating in\norientation from unit cell to unit cell. Thus, for thick MnSi films, the unit\ncell volume is essentially that of bulk MnSi --- except in the vicinity of the\ninterface with the Si substrate (thin film limit). In view of the enhanced\nmagnetic transition temperature we conclude that the mere presence of the\ninterface, and its specific characteristics, strongly affects the magnetic\nproperties of the entire MnSi film, even far from the interface. Our analysis\nprovides invaluable information about the local strain at the MnSi/Si(111)\ninterface. The presented methodology of polarization dependent EXAFS can also\nbe employed to investigate the local structure of other interesting interfaces.\n", "  Diffusion behavior of Brownian particles in confined spaces was studied for\nthe displacements notably shorter than the confinement size. The confinements,\nresembling structure of porous solids, were modeled using a spatially-varying\npotential field with an infinitely large potential representing the solid part\nand zero potential in the void space. Between them, a smooth transient\nmimicking the interaction potential of the tracer molecules with the pore walls\nwas applied. The respective Smoluchowski equation describing diffusion of\ntracer particles in the thus created force field was solved under certain\napproximations allowing for a general analytical solution. The time-depended\ndiffusion coefficient obtained was found to agree with that obtained earlier\nusing the Fick's diffusion equation, but with a different numerical constant.\nNumerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation with selected interaction\npotentials was used to clarify the origin of this discrepancy. The conditions\nunder which the solutions obtained within these two approaches converge were\nestablished.\n", "  We extend [Bru-de Siqueira Pedra-Hertling, J. Math. Phys. 56 (2015) 051901]\nin order to study the linear response of free fermions on the lattice within a\n(independently and identically distributed) random potential to a macroscopic\nelectric field that is time- and space-dependent. We obtain the notion of a\nmacroscopic AC-conductivity measure which only results from the second\nprinciple of thermodynamics. The latter corresponds here to the positivity of\nthe heat production for cyclic processes on equilibrium states. Its Fourier\ntransform is a continuous bounded function which is naturally called\n(macroscopic) conductivity. We additionally derive Green-Kubo relations\ninvolving time-correlations of bosonic fields coming from current fluctuations\nin the system. This is reminiscent of non-commutative central limit theorems.\n", "  The shape equation of lipid membranes [Zhong-can and Helfrich(1987) PRL 59\n2486] is a fourth-order partial differential equation. Under the axisymmetric\ncondition, this equation was transformed into a second-order ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) by Zheng and Liu [Zheng and Liu(1993) PRE 48 2856].\nHere we try to further reduce this second-order ODE to a first-order ODE by\nseeking for first integrals according to the Noether theorem. We indeed find a\nfirst integral when the second-order ODE is invariant under conformation\ntransformations. We obtain the mechanical interpretation of the first integral\nby using the membrane stress tensor.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a negative Kerr nonlinearity for quasi-undoped\ngraphene. Hereto, we introduce the method of chirped-pulse-pumped self-phase\nmodulation and apply it to graphene-covered silicon waveguides at telecom\nwavelengths. The extracted Kerr-nonlinear index for graphene equals n2,gr =\n-10^(-13) m^2/W. Whereas the sign of n2,gr turns out to be negative in contrast\nto what has been assumed so far, its magnitude is in correspondence with that\nobserved in earlier experiments. Graphene's negative Kerr nonlinearity strongly\nimpacts how graphene should be exploited for enhancing the nonlinear response\nof photonic (integrated) devices exhibiting a positive nonlinearity. It also\nopens up the possibility of using graphene to annihilate unwanted nonlinear\neffects in such devices, to develop unexplored approaches for establishing Kerr\nprocesses, and to extend the scope of the \"periodic poling\" method often used\nfor second-order nonlinearities towards third-order Kerr processes. Because of\nthe generic nature of the chirped-pulse-pumped self-phase modulation method, it\nwill allow fully characterizing the Kerr nonlinearity of essentially any novel\n(2D) material.\n", "  The magnetic fields, activity and dynamos of young solar-type stars can be\nempirically studied using time-series of spectropolarimetric observations and\ntomographic imaging techniques such as Doppler imaging and Zeeman Doppler\nimaging. In this paper we use these techniques to study the young Sun-like star\nEK Draconis (Sp-Type: G1.5V, HD 129333) using ESPaDOnS at the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope and NARVAL at the T\\`elescope Bernard Lyot. This\nmulti-epoch study runs from late 2006 until early 2012. We measure high levels\nof chromospheric activity indicating an active, and varying, chromosphere.\nSurface brightness features were constructed for all available epochs. The\n2006/7 and 2008 data show large spot features appearing at\nintermediate-latitudes. However, the 2012 data indicate a distinctive polar\nspot. We observe a strong, almost unipolar, azimuthal field during all epochs\nthat is similar to that observed on other Sun-like stars. Using magnetic\nfeatures, we determined an average equatorial rotational velocity, \\Omega_eq,\nof 2.50 +/- 0.08 rad/d. High levels of surface differential rotation were\nmeasured with an average rotational shear, \\Delta\\Omega, of 0.27 +0.24-0.26\nrad/d. During an intensively observed 3-month period from December 2006 until\nFebruary 2007, the magnetic field went from predominantly toroidal ( approx.\n80%) to a more balanced poloidal-toroidal (approx. 40-60%) field. Although the\nlarge-scale magnetic field evolved over the epochs of our observations, no\npolarity reversals were found in our data.\n", "  The vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of the Mie potential, where the dispersive\nexponent is constant (m = 6) while the repulsive exponent n is varied between 9\nand 48, is systematically investigated by molecular simulation. For systems\nwith planar vapor-liquid interfaces, long-range correction expressions are\nderived, so that interfacial and bulk properties can be computed accurately.\nThe present simulation results are found to be consistent with the available\nbody of literature on the Mie fluid which is substantially extended. On the\nbasis of correlations for the considered thermodynamic properties, a\nmulticriteria optimization becomes viable. Thereby, users can adjust the three\nparameters of the Mie potential to the properties of real fluids, weighting\ndifferent thermodynamic properties according to their importance for a\nparticular application scenario. In the present work, this is demonstrated for\ncarbon dioxide for which different competing objective functions are studied\nwhich describe the accuracy of the model for representing the saturated liquid\ndensity, the vapor pressure and the surface tension. It is shown that models\ncan be found which describe simultaneously the saturated liquid density and\nvapor pressure with good accuracy, and it is discussed to what extent this\naccuracy can be upheld as the model accuracy for the surface tension is further\nimproved.\n", "  To investigate the light scalar tetraquark candidate $a_0(980)$ (quantum\nnumbers $J^P =0^+$), a correlation matrix including a variety of two- and\nfour-quark interpolating operators has to be computed. We discuss efficient\ntechniques to compute the elements of this correlation matrix, in particular\ndiagrams with closed quark loops. Furthermore, we present evidence that such\ndiagrams are not negligible given our precision, and their contribution is\nessential to obtain physically meaningful results. In particular, we find\nindications of the existence of an \"additional\" state around the two-particle\nthresholds of $K+ \\bar K$ and $\\eta +\\pi$, which could correspond to the\n$a_0(980)$ meson.\n", "  An increasing number of research topics and applications ask for a precise\nmeasurement of the size distribution of small bubbles in a liquid - and hence\nfor reliable and automated image analysis. However, due to the strong mismatch\nbetween the refractive index of a liquid and a gas, bubbles deform strongly the\npath of light rays, rendering automated bubble size analysis a challenging\ntask. We show here how this challenge can be met using the fact that bubbles\nact like inverted, spherical lenses with a curvature which is the inverse of\nthe bubble radius. The imaging properties of each bubble can then be used to\naccurately determine the radius of the bubble upon imaging an object which can\nbe filtered easily by a computer. When bubbles are large enough to be deformed\nunder the influence of gravity, it is more appropriate to measure their size\nafter squeezing them between two narrowly spaced glass plates. We therefore\nshow here, how the analysis can be extended to this case; and how both\napproaches can be combined to measure the size distributions of strongly\npolydisperse foams containing simultaneously small (several 10s of micrometres)\nand large bubbles (several 100s of micrometres).\n", "  Neutrino oscillations physics is entered in the precision era. In this\ncontext accelerator-based neutrino experiments need a reduction of systematic\nerrors to the level of a few percent. Today one of the most important sources\nof systematic errors are neutrino-nucleus cross sections which in the\nhundreds-MeV to few-GeV energy region are known with a precision not exceeding\n20%. In this article we review the present experimental and theoretical\nknowledge of the neutrino-nucleus interaction physics. After introducing\nneutrino oscillation physics and accelerator-based neutrino experiments, we\noverview general aspects of the neutrino-nucleus cross sections, both\ntheoretical and experimental views. Then we focus on these quantities in\ndifferent reaction channels. We start with the quasielastic and\nquasielastic-like cross section, putting a special emphasis on multinucleon\nemission channel which attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. We\nreview the main aspects of the different microscopic models for this channel by\ndiscussing analogies and differences among them.The discussion is always driven\nby a comparison with the experimental data. We then consider the one pion\nproduction channel where data-theory agreement remains very unsatisfactory. We\ndescribe how to interpret pion data, then we analyze in particular the puzzle\nrelated to the impossibility of theoretical models and Monte Carlo to\nsimultaneously describe MiniBooNE and MINERvA experimental results. Inclusive\ncross sections are also discussed, as well as the comparison between the\n$\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_e$ cross sections, relevant for the CP violation\nexperiments. The impact of the nuclear effects on the reconstruction of\nneutrino energy and on the determination of the neutrino oscillation parameters\nis reviewed. A window to the future is finally opened by discussing projects\nand efforts in future detectors, beams, and analysis.\n", "  Thin polymer films have attracted attention because of both their broad range\nof applications and of the fundamental questions they raise regarding the\ndynamic response of confined polymers. These films are unstable if the\ntemperature is above their glass transition temperature Tg. Here, we describe\nfreestanding thin films of centimetric dimensions made of a comb copolymer melt\nfar from its glass transition that are stable for more than a day. These long\nlifetimes allowed us to characterize the drainage dynamics and the thickness\nprofile of the films. Stratified regions appear as the film drains. We have\nevidence that the stability, thinning dynamics and thickness profile of the\nfilms result from structural forces in the melt. Understanding the key\nmechanisms behind our observations may lead to new developments in polymeric\nthin films, foams and emulsions without the use of stabilizing agents.\n", "  The analysis of the electronic surface properties of transition metal oxides\nbeing key materials for future nanoelectronics requires a direct\ncharacterization of the conductivity with highest spatial resolution. Using\nlocal conductivity atomic force microscopy (LC-AFM) we demonstrate the\npossibility of recording current maps with true atomic resolution. The\napplication of this technique on surfaces of reduced TiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$\nreveals that the distribution of surface conductivity has a significant\nlocalized nature. Assisted by density functional theory (DFT) we propose that\nthe presence of oxygen vacancies in the surface layer of such materials can\nintroduce short range disturbances of electronic structure with confinement of\nmetallic states on the nanoscale.\n", "  Recently, in the DGFRS related experiments the discoveries of new superheavy\nelements 114 to 118 were successfully performed. As concerns to a background\nradical suppression in those experiments it was namely Active correlations\nmethod which was applied to this goal. Note, that application of DSSSD detector\nallows one to apply this method more effectively, although with some\ndifficulties due to neighbor strips edge effects. Present version of the DGFRS\nspectrometer is presented. Shapes of ER registered energy spectra in the nat\nYb+48Ca reaction are presented. First results of its application in the\n240Pu+48Ca=Fl complete fusion nuclear reaction are presented too. Conclusion,\nthat edge effects are to a first approximation explained by the role of inter\nstrips area is drawn.\n", "  When does a diffusing particle reach its target for the first time? This\nfirst-passage time (FPT) problem is central to the kinetics of molecular\nreactions in chemistry and molecular biology. Here we explain the behavior of\nsmooth FPT densities, for which all moments are finite, and demonstrate\nuniversal yet generally non-Poissonian long-time asymptotics for a broad\nvariety of transport processes. While Poisson-like asymptotics arise\ngenerically in the presence of an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity\nof the target, a time-scale separation between direct and reflected indirect\ntrajectories gives rise to a universal proximity effect: Direct paths, heading\nmore or less straight from the point of release to the target, become typical\nand focused, with a narrow spread of the corresponding first passage times.\nConversely, statistically dominant indirect paths exploring the system size\ntend to be massively dissimilar. The initial distance to the target\nparticularly impacts gene regulatory or competitive stochastic processes, for\nwhich often few binding events determine the regulatory outcome. The proximity\neffect is independent of details of the transport, highlighting the robust\ncharacter of the FPT features uncovered here.\n", "  A family of new one-parameter (\\epsilon_x=\\pm 1) nonlinear wave models\n(called G_{\\epsilon_x}^{(nm)} model) is presented, including both the local\n(\\epsilon_x=1) and new integrable nonlocal $(\\epsilon_x=-1)$ general vector\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (VNLS) equations with the self-phase, cross-phase, and\nmulti-wave mixing modulations. The nonlocal G_{-1}^{(nm)} model is shown to\npossess the Lax pair and infinite number of conservation laws for $m=1$. We\nalso establish a connection between the G_{\\epsilon_x}^{(nm)} model and some\nknown models. Some symmetric reductions and exact solutions (e.g., bright,\ndark, and mixed bright-dark solitons) of the representative nonlocal systems\nare also found. Moreover, we find that the new general two-parameter\n(\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t) model (called G_{\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t}^{(nm)} model)\nincluding the G_{\\epsilon_x}^{(nm)} model is invariant under the PT-symmetric\ntransformation and the PT symmetribility of its self-induced potentials is\ndiscussed for the distinct two parameters (\\epsilon_x, \\epsilon_t)=(\\pm 1, \\pm\n1).\n", "  Multibody systems usually give rise to complex nonlinear dynamics, and the\nbicycle is not an exception. Even a simple model as the Two-Mass-Skate presents\na long expression of the kinetic energy, making difficult to write explicitly\nthe equations of motion. Instead of linearising or approximating the model, we\nwill overcome this issue by using a functional expression of the kinetic\nenergy. With introduction of appropriate nonlinear functions, the equations of\nmotion are written in a form that can be easily handled despite their\ncomplexity. A stability analysis of the dynamics is then conducted.\n", "  We consider a mathematical model for the weak decay of the intermediate boson\n$Z^0$ into neutrinos and antineutrinos. We prove that the total Hamiltonian has\na unique ground state in Fock space and we establish a limiting absorption\nprinciple, local decay and a property of relaxation to the ground state for\ninitial states and observables suitably localized in energy and position. Our\nproofs rest, in particular, on Mourre's theory and a low-energy decomposition.\n", "  Classic tests of CPT symmetry have been done in the neutral-meson system.\nThese have been continued with new results in the framework of the\nStandard-Model Extension, where the coefficient for CPT violation is both boost\nand direction dependent. Recent contributions and new phenomenological\nimprovements are discussed with possible new contributions for $b$ and $d$\nspecific correlated decays at the Belle II asymmetric energy collider.\n", "  We consider the quantum loop effects in scalar electrodynamics on de Sitter\nspace by making use of the functional renormalization group approach. We first\nintegrate out the photon field, which can be done exactly to leading (zeroth)\norder in the gradients of the scalar field, thereby making this method suitable\nfor investigating the dynamics of the infrared sector of the theory. Assuming\nthat the scalar remains light we then apply the functional renormalization\ngroup methods to the resulting effective scalar theory and focus on\ninvestigating the effective potential, which is the leading order contribution\nin the gradient expansion of the effective action. We find symmetry restoration\nat a critical renormalization scale $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm cr}$ much below the\nHubble scale $H$. When compared with the results of Serreau and Guilleux\n[arXiv:1306.3846 [hep-th], arXiv:1506.06183 [hep-th]] we find that the photon\nfacilitates symmetry restoration such that it occurs at an RG scale\n$\\kappa_{\\rm cr}$ that is higher than in the case of a pure scalar theory. The\ntrue effective potential is recovered when $\\kappa\\rightarrow 0$ and in that\nlimit one obtains the results that agree with those of stochastic inflation,\nprovided one interprets it in the sense as advocated by Lazzari and Prokopec\n[arXiv:1304.0404 [hep-th]].\n", "  Engineering apparatus that harness quantum theory offers practical advantages\nover current technology. A fundamentally more powerful prospect is the\nlong-standing prediction that such quantum technologies could out-perform any\nfuture iteration of their classical counterparts, no matter how well the\nattributes of those classical strategies can be improved. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate such an instance of \\textit{absolute} advantage per\nphoton probe in the precision of optical direct absorption measurement. We use\ncorrelated intensity measurements of spontaneous parametric downconversion\nusing a commercially available air-cooled CCD, a new estimator for data\nanalysis and a high heralding efficiency photon-pair source. We show this\nenables improvement in the precision of measurement, per photon probe, beyond\nwhat is achievable with an ideal coherent state (a perfect laser) detected with\n$100\\%$ efficient and noiseless detection. We see this absolute improvement for\nup to $50\\%$ absorption, with a maximum observed factor of improvement of 1.46.\nThis equates to around $32\\%$ reduction in the total number of photons\ntraversing an optical sample, compared to any future direct optical absorption\nmeasurement using classical light.\n", "  In the last decades several correlations between the mass of the central\nsupermassive black hole (BH) and properties of the host galaxy - such as bulge\nluminosity and mass, central stellar velocity dispersion, S\\'ersic index,\nspiral pitch angle etc. - have been found and point at a coevolution scenario\nof BH and host galaxy. In this article, I review some of these relations for\ninactive galaxies and discuss the findings for galaxies that host an active\ngalactic nucleus/quasar. I present the results of our group that finds that\nactive galaxies at $z\\lesssim 0.1$ do not follow the BH mass - bulge luminosity\nrelation. Furthermore, I show near-infrared integral-field spectroscopic data\nthat suggest that young stellar populations cause the bulge overluminosity and\nindicate that the host galaxy growth started first. Finally, I discuss\nimplications for the BH-host coevolution.\n", "  The problem of reconstructing information on a physical system from data\nacquired in long sequences of direct (projective) measurements of some simple\nphysical quantities - histories - is analyzed within quantum mechanics; that\nis, the quantum theory of indirect measurements, and, in particular, of\nnon-demolition measurements is studied. It is shown that indirect measurements\nof time-independent features of physical systems can be described in terms of\nquantum-mechanical operators belonging to an algebra of asymptotic observables.\nOur proof involves associating a natural measure space with certain sets of\nhistories of a system and showing that quantum-mechanical states of the system\ndetermine probability measures on this space. Our main result then says that\nfunctions on that space of histories measurable at infinity (i.e., functions\nthat only depend on the tails of histories) correspond to operators in the\nalgebra of asymptotic observables.\n", "  We carry out multifractal analyses of multiple tracers namely the main galaxy\nsample, the LRG sample and the quasar sample from the SDSS to test the\nassumption of cosmic homogeneity and identify the scale of transition to\nhomogeneity, if any. We consider the behaviour of the scaled number counts and\nthe scaling relations of different moments of the galaxy number counts in\nspheres of varying radius $R$ to calculate the spectrum of the\nMinkowski-Bouligand general dimension $D_{q} (R)$ for $-4 \\leq q \\leq 4$. The\npresent analysis provides us the opportunity to study the spectrum of the\ngeneralized dimension $D_{q}(R)$ for multiple tracers of the cosmic density\nfield over a wide range of length scales and allows us to confidently test the\nvalidity of the assumption of cosmic homogeneity. Our analysis indicates that\nthe SDSS main galaxy sample is homogeneous on a length scales of $80\\, h^{-1}\\,\n{\\rm Mpc} $ and beyond whereas the SDSS quasar sample and the SDSS LRG sample\nshow transition to homogeneity on an even larger length scales at $\\sim 150\\,\nh^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$ and $\\sim 230\\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$ respectively. These\ndifferences in the scale of homogeneity arise due to the effective mass and\nredshift scales probed by the different tracers in a Universe where structures\nform hierarchically. Our results reaffirm the validity of cosmic homogeneity on\nlarge scales irrespective of the tracers used and strengthens the foundations\nof the Standard Model of Cosmology.\n", "  Magnetron sputtering has also been used to deposit thin films of some\nmaterials and it has significant technological importance. A modeling on\ndeposition of epitaxial thin films of Yttrium Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) was\ndone the diffusion of adatom on the surface were studies. There exists a strong\ninteraction of ions formed in the plasma during the sputtering process. Cu thin\nfilms were deposited on Si. Nanocomposite thin film of SiCN showed dendritic\ngrowth.\n", "  Raman studies of nanocomposite SiCN thin film by sputtering showed that with\nan increase of substrate temperature from room temperature to 500oC, a\ntransition from mostly sp2 graphitic phase to sp3 carbon took place which was\nobserved from the variation of ID/IG ratio and the peak shifts. This process\nresulted in the growth of C3N4 and Si3N4 crystallites in the amorphous matrix\nwhich led to an increase in hardness and modulus obtained through\nnanoindentation. However, at a further higher temperature of 600oC, again an\nincrease of sp2 C concentration in the film was observed and the H and E values\nshowed a decrease due to increased growth of graphitic carbon phase. The whole\nprocess got reflected in a modified four stage Ferrari Robertson model of Raman\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We followed the collective atomic-scale motion of Na atoms on a vicinal\nCu(115) surface within a time scale of pico to nano-seconds using helium spin\necho spectroscopy. The well defined stepped structure of Cu(115) allows us to\nstudy the effect that atomic steps have on the adsorption properties, the rate\nfor motion parallel and perpendicular to the step edge and the interaction\nbetween the Na atoms. With the support of a molecular dynamics simulation we\nshow that the Na atoms perform strongly anisotropic one dimensional hopping\nmotion parallel to the step edges. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial and\ntemporal correlations between the Na atoms which lead to collective motion are\nalso anisotropic, suggesting the steps efficiently screen the lateral\ninteraction between Na atoms residing on different terraces.\n", "  We present preliminary results of JVLA wideband full polarization\nobservations of a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with very high\nRotation Measure (RM) values, a sign of extreme environment. Polarization\nproperties show a complex behaviour such that the polarization angle (PA) and\nfractional polarization (fp) change dramatically within the wide band. The\nmeasured RM is not constant within the wide band. Its complex behaviour\nreflects the complexity of the medium with the presence of several Faraday\ncomponents. The depolarization has been studied by modelling the variations of\nthe Stokes parameters Q and U together with the polarization parameters (PA and\nfp) with wavelength using combinations of the simplest existing depolarization\nmodels. With this JVLA study we could spectrally resolve multiple polarized\ncomponents of unresolved AGN. These preliminary results reveal the complexity\nof these objects, but improvements to the depolarization modelling are needed\nto better understand the polarization structure of these sources.\n", "  The rapidly expanding hardware-intrinsic security primitives are aimed at\naddressing significant security challenges of a massively interconnected world\nin the age of information technology. The main idea of such primitives is to\nemploy instance-specific process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a\nsource of cryptographic data. Among the emergent technologies, memristive\ndevices provide unique opportunities for security applications due to the\nunderlying stochasticity in their operation. Herein, we report a prototype of a\nrobust, dense, and reconfigurable physical unclonable function primitives based\non the three-dimensional passive metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, by\nmaking positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear\nI-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a\nbasic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with\nmonolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.\nThe experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,\nmeasured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,\nis close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The\nuniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances\nof crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50%\n+/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability,\nmeasured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5%\n+/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate\nphysically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge\ngeneration that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has\ncomparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate.\n", "  Within a five-particle model (three $\\alpha$-particles plus two nucleons),\nthe structure functions of mirror nuclei $^{14}$C and $^{14}$O are studied.\nUsing the variational approach with Gaussian bases, the energies and wave\nfunctions are calculated for these five-particle systems. Two spatial\nconfigurations in the ground-state wave function are revealed. The r.m.s.\ncharge radius of $^{14}$O nucleus is found to be $2.415\\pm0.005$ fm. The charge\ndensity distributions and the form factors of both nuclei are predicted. The\npair correlation functions are analyzed, and the r.m.s. relative distances are\ncalculated. The momentum distributions of particles are found.\n", "  Watchings of Canopus as a herald of the winter were important duties of\nancient priests-astronomers on Easter Island. All the analysed data witness\nthat this star was observed during the first and second voyages from Mangareva\nto the island. The names of king Hotu-Matua (Anua-Motua) and his father Tara\ntahi have been decoded. Several rongorongo records from the Esteban Atan\nmanuscript have been deciphered advantageously. The new view at a painted\nbarkcloth figurine connected with the bird-man cult has been offered. Some data\nabout watchings of Aldebaran, the Pleiades, the sun, the moon, Venus and Mars\nhave been collected as well.\n", "  The question of Fermi liquid vs. non-Fermi liquid behavior induced by strong\ncorrelations is one of the prominent problems in metallic local moment systems.\nAs standard models for such systems, the SU(N) x SU(M) Anderson impurity models\nexhibit both Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid behavior, depending on their\nsymmetry. Using an auxiliary boson method, we present a generally applicable\nscheme to select the relevant contributions in the low frequency regime, while\npreserving the local gauge symmetry of the model. It amounts to a conserving\nT-matrix approximation (CTMA) including coherent spin flip as well as charge\nfluctuation processes, which are found to dominate in the Kondo and in the\nmixed valence regime, respectively. The infrared threshold exponents of the\nauxiliary particle spectral functions are indicators for the presence of Fermi\nor non-Fermi liquid behavior in any given model with strong on-site repulsion.\nWe show that, in contrast to earlier auxiliary boson theories, the CTMA\nrecovers the correct exponents in both cases, indicating that it correctly\ndescribes both the Fermi and the non-Fermi regimes of the Anderson model.\n", "  We derive two types of Ward identities for the generating functions for\ninvariant integrals of monomials of the fundamental characters for arbitrary\nsimple compact Lie groups. The results are applied to the groups SU(3), Spin(5)\nand G_2 of rank 2 as well as SU(4).\n"]}
