quantum proof with perfect completeness and soundness which is\npolynomially close to 1 in a context where the verifier is provided a proof\nwith two unentangled parts. We then show that PQMA_log(2) = NP. For this to be\npossible, it is important, when defining the class, not to give too much power\nto the verifier. This result, when compared to the fact that QMA_log = BQP,\ngives us new insight on the power of quantum information and the impact of\nentanglement.\n", "  Context. The high degree of deuteration observed in some prestellar cores\ndepends on the ortho-to-para H2 ratio through the H3+ fractionation. Aims. We\nwant to constrain the ortho/para H2 ratio across the L183 prestellar core. This\nis mandatory to correctly describe the deuter- ation amplification phenomenon\nin depleted cores such as L183 and to relate the total (ortho+para) H2D+\nabundance to the sole ortho-H2D+ column density measurement. Methods. To\nconstrain this ortho/para H2 ratio and derive its profile, we make use of the\nN2D+ /N2H+ ratio and of the ortho-H2D+ observations performed across the\nprestellar core. We use two simple chemical models limited to an almost totally\ndepleted core description. New dissociative recombination and trihydrogen\ncation-dihydrogen reaction rates (including all isotopologues) are presented in\nthis paper and included in our models. Results. We estimate the H2D+ ortho/para\nratio in the L183 cloud, and constrain the H2 ortho/para ratio : we show that\nit is varying across the prestellar core by at least an order of magnitude\nbeing still very high (~0.1) in most of the cloud. Our time-dependent model\nindicates that the prestellar core is presumably older than 1.5-2 x 10^5 years\nbut that it may not be much older. We also show that it has reached its present\ndensity only recently and that its contraction from a uniform density cloud can\nbe constrained. Conclusions. A proper understanding of deuteration chemistry\ncannot be attained without taking into account the whole ortho/para family of\nmolecular hydrogen and trihydrogen cation isotopologues as their relations are\nof utmost importance in the global scheme. Tracing the ortho/para H2 ratio\nshould also give useful constraints on the dynamical evolution of prestellar\ncores.\n", "  The recently discovered coeval, moving groups of young stellar objects in the\nsolar neighborhood represent invaluable laboratories to study recent star\nformation and to search for high metallicity stars which can be included in\nfuture exo-planet surveys. In this study we derived through an uniform and\nhomogeneous method stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances for iron,\nsilicium and nickel in 63 Post T-Tauri Stars from 11 nearby young associations.\nWe further compare the results with two different pre-main sequence (PMS) and\nmain sequence (MS) star populations. The stellar atmospheric parameters and the\nabundances presented here were derived using the equivalent width of individual\nlines in the stellar spectra through the excitation/ionization equilibrium of\niron. Moreover, we compared the observed Balmer lines with synthetic profiles\ncalculated for model atmospheres with a different line formation code. We found\nthat the synthetic profiles agree reasonably well with the observed profiles,\nalthough the Balmer lines of many stars are substantially filled-in, probably\nby chromospheric emission. Solar metallicity is found to be a common trend on\nall the nearby young associations studied. The low abundance dispersion within\neach association strengthens the idea that the origin of these nearby young\nassociations is related to the nearby Star Forming regions (SFR). Abundances of\nelements other than iron are consistent with previous results on Main Sequence\nstars in the solar neighborhood. The chemical characterization of the members\nof the newly found nearby young associations, performed in this study and\nintended to proceed in subsequent works, is essential for understanding and\ntesting the context of local star formation and the evolutionary history of the\ngalaxy.\n", "  Chromatin organization and dynamics is studied in this work at scales ranging\nfrom single nucleosome to nucleosomal array by using a unique combination of\nbiochemical assays, single molecule imaging technique and numerical modeling.\nWe demonstrate that a subtle modification in the nucleosome structure induced\nby the histone variant H2A.Bbd drastically modifies the higher order\norganization of the nucleosomal arrays. Importantly, as directly visualized by\nAFM, conventional H2A nucleosomal arrays exhibit specific local organization,\nin contrast to H2A.Bbd arrays, which show \"beads on a string\" structure. The\ncombination of systematic image analysis and theoretical modeling allows a\nquantitative description relating the observed gross structural changes of the\narrays to their local organization. Our results strongly suggest that\nhigher-order organization of H1-free nucleosomal arrays is mainly determined by\nthe fluctuation properties of individual nucleosomes. Moreover, numerical\nsimulations suggest the existence of attractive interactions between\nnucleosomes to provide the degree of compaction observed for conventional\nchromatin fibers.\n", "  We review problems involving the use of Grassmann techniques in the field of\nclassical spin systems in two dimensions. These techniques are useful to\nperform exact correspondences between classical spin Hamiltonians and\nfield-theory fermionic actions. This contributes to a better understanding of\ncritical behavior of these models in term of non-quadratic effective actions\nwhich can been seen as an extension of the free fermion Ising model. Within\nthis method, identification of bare masses allows for an accurate estimation of\ncritical points or lines and which is supported by Monte-Carlo results and\ndiagrammatic techniques.\n", "  Neutron powder diffraction measurements have been performed on\nCe_xNd_{1-x}B_6 (x = 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8) solid solutions to determine the\ntype of magnetic order occurring in these compounds as a result of the\ninterplay between magnetic dipole exchange and antiferroquadrupolar\ninteractions. In the Ce-rich range, the sequence of two magnetic phases, with\nan incommensurate order [k = (1/4 -\\delta, 1/4 -\\delta, 1/2)] forming below T N\nfollowed by a lock-in--type transition at lower temperature, is quite similar\nto that reported earlier for Ce_xPr_{1-x} B_6. For x = 0.5, on the other hand,\nthe same antiferromagnetic order as in pure NdB6 first occurs at TN, then\ncoexists with an incommensurate component below the lower transition\ntemperature. These results are in good agreement with previous resistivity\nmeasurements and support the idea that Ce and Nd magnetic moments in this\nsystem can be relatively decoupled.\n", "  We report the first experimental evidence for a strong electromechanical\ncoupling in the Mott insulator GaTa4Se8 allowing a highly reproducible\nnano-writing with a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). The local electric\nfield across the STM junction is observed to have a threshold value above which\nthe clean (100) surface of GaTa4Se8 becomes mechanically instable: At voltage\nbiases V > 1.1V the surface suddenly inflates and comes in contact with the STM\ntip, resulting in nanometer size craters. The formed pattern can be\nindestructibly \"read\" by STM at lower voltage bias, thus allowing a 5\nTdots/inch2 dense writing/reading at room temperature. The discovery of the\nelectromechanical coupling in GaTa4Se8 might give new clues in the\nunderstanding of the Electric Pulse Induced Resistive Switching recently\nobserved in this stoechiometric Mott insulator.\n", "  We focus on Horava-Lifshitz (HL) theory of gravity, and, in particular, on\nthe Kehagias and Sfetsos s solution that is the analog of Schwarzschild black\nhole of General Relativity. In the weak-field and slow-motion approximation we\nanalytically work out the secular precession of the longitude of the pericentre\nof a test particle induced by this solution. Its analytical form is different\nfrom that of the general relativistic Einstein's pericentre precession. Then,\nwe compare it to the latest determinations of the corrections to the standard\nNewtonian/ Einsteinian planetary perihelion precessions recently estimated by\nE.V. Pitjeva with the EPM2008 ephemerides. It turns out that the planets of the\nsolar system, taken singularly one at a time, allow to put lower bounds on the\nadimensional HL parameter \\psi_0 of the order of 10^-12 (Mercury) 10^-24\n(Pluto). They are not able to account for the Pioneer anomalous acceleration\nfor r > 20 AU.\n", "  We define a new theory of discrete Riemann surfaces and present its basic\nresults. The key idea is to consider not only a cellular decomposition of a\nsurface, but the union with its dual. Discrete holomorphy is defined by a\nstraightforward discretisation of the Cauchy-Riemann equation. A lot of\nclassical results in Riemann theory have a discrete counterpart, Hodge star,\nharmonicity, Hodge theorem, Weyl's lemma, Cauchy integral formula, existence of\nholomorphic forms with prescribed holonomies. Giving a geometrical meaning to\nthe construction on a Riemann surface, we define a notion of criticality on\nwhich we prove a continuous limit theorem. We investigate its connection with\ncriticality in the Ising model. We set up a Dirac equation on a discrete\nuniversal spin structure and we prove that the existence of a Dirac spinor is\nequivalent to criticality.\n", "  We present the results of a survey for damped (DLA, log N(H I) > 20.3) and\nsub-damped Lyman-? systems (19.5 < log N(H I) < 20.3) at z > 2.55 along the\nlines-of-sight to 77 quasars with emission redshifts in the range 4 < zem <\n6.3. Intermediate resolution (R ? 4300) spectra have been obtained with the\nEchellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) mounted on the Keck telescope. A total\nof 100 systems with log N(H I) > 19.5 are detected of which 40 systems are\ndamped Lyman-? systems for an absorption length of ?X = 378. About half of the\nlines of sight of this homogeneous survey have never been investigated for\nDLAs. We study the evolution with redshift of the cosmological density of the\nneutral gas and find, consis- tently with previous studies at similar\nresolution, that ?DLA,H I decreases at z > 3.5. The overall cosmological\nevolution of ?HI shows a peak around this redshift. The H I column density\ndistribution for log N(H I) ? 20.3 is ?tted, consistently with previous\nsurveys, with a single power-law of index ? ? -1.8$\\pm$0.25. This power-law\noverpredicts data at the high-end and a second, much steeper, power-law (or a\ngamma function) is needed. There is a flattening of the function at lower H I\ncolumn densities with an index of ? ? ?1.4 for the column density range log N(H\nI) = 19.5?21. The fraction of H I mass in sub-DLAs is of the order of 30%. The\nH column density distribution does not evolve strongly from z ? 2.5 to z ? 4.5.\n", "  New results on the B[e] star HD87643 are presented here. They were obtained\nwith a wide range of different instruments, from wide-field imaging with the\nWFI camera, high resolution spectroscopy with the FEROS instrument, high\nangular resolution imaging with the adaptive optics camera NACO, to the highest\nangular resolution available with AMBER on the VLTI. We report the detection of\na companion to HD87643 with AMBER, subsequently confirmed in the NACO data.\nImplications of that discovery to some of the previously\ndifficult-to-understand data-sets are then presented.\n", "  Motivated by the possible extension into a supersymmetric Randall-Sundrum\n(RS) model, we investigate the properties of the vacuum expectation value (VEV)\nof the stress-energy tensor for a quantized bulk Dirac spinor field in the RS\ngeometry and compare it with that for a real scalar field. This is carried out\nvia the Green function method based on first principles without invoking the\ndegeneracy factor, whose validity in a warp geometry is a priori unassured. In\naddition, we investigate the local behavior of the Casimir energy near the two\nbranes. One salient feature we found is that the surface divergences near the\ntwo branes have opposite signs. We argue that this is a generic feature of the\nfermionic Casimir energy density due to its parity transformation in the fifth\ndimension. Furthermore, we investigate the self-consistency of the RS metric\nunder the quantum correction due to the stress-energy tensor. It is shown that\nthe VEV of the stress-energy tensor and the classical one become comparable\nnear the visible brane if k ~ M ~ M_Pl (the requirement of no hierarchy\nproblem), where k is the curvature of the RS warped geometry and M the\n5-dimensional Planck mass. In that case the self-consistency of RS model that\nincludes bulk fields is in doubt. If, however, k <~ M, then an approximate\nself-consistency of the RS-type metric may still be satisfied.\n", "  We study the role of the quasi-linear diffusion (QLD) in producing X-ray\nemission by means of ultra-relativistic electrons in AGN magnetospheric flows.\nWe examined two regions: (a) an area close to the black hole and (b) the outer\nmagnetosphere. The synchrotron emission has been studied for ultra-relativistic\nelectrons and was shown that the QLD generates the soft and hard X-rays, close\nto the black hole and on the light cylinder scales respectively. By considering\nthe cyclotron instability, we show that despite the short synchrotron cooling\ntimescales, the cyclotron modes excite transverse and longitudinal-transversal\nwaves. On the other hand, it is demonstrated that the synchrotron reaction\nforce and a force responsible for the conservation of the adiabatic invariant\ntend to decrease the pitch angles, whereas the diffusion, that pushes back on\nelectrons by means of the aforementioned waves, tends to increase the pitch\nangles. By examining the quasi-stationary state, we investigate a regime in\nwhich these two processes are balanced and a non-vanishing value of pitch\nangles is created.\n", "  In this letter we study the coherent electronic transport through a metallic\nnanowire with magnetic impurities. The spins of these impurities are considered\nas frozen to mimic a low temperature spin glass phase. The transport properties\nof the wire are derived from a numerical Landauer technique which provides the\nconductance of the wire as a function of the disorder configuration. We show\nthat the correlation of conductance between two spin configurations provides a\nmeasure of the correlation between these spin configurations. This correlation\ncorresponds to the mean field overlap in the absence of any spatial order\nbetween the spin configurations. Moreover, we find that these conductance\ncorrelations are sensitive to the spatial order between the two spin\nconfigurations, i.e whether the spin ?ips between them occur in a compact\nregion or not.\n", "  The summation of the small x-corrections to hard-scattering QCD amplitudes by\ncollinear factorisation method is reconsidered and the K-factor is derived in\nleading ln x approximation with a result differing from the corresponding\nexpression by Catani and Hautmann (Nucl. Phys. B 427, 475, 1994). The\nsignificance of the difference is demonstrated in the examples of structure\nfunction F_L and of exclusive vector meson electroproduction. The formulation\ncovers the channels of non-vanishing conformal spin n paving the way for new\napplications.\n", "  For volume reflection process in a bent crystal, exact analytic expressions\nfor positively- and negatively-charged particle trajectories are obtained\nwithin a model of parabolic continuous potential in each interplanar interval,\nwith the neglect of incoherent multiple scattering. In the limit of the crystal\nbending radius greatly exceeding the critical value, asymptotic formulas are\nobtained for the particle mean deflection angle in units of Lindhard's critical\nangle, and for the final beam profile. Volume reflection of negatively charged\nparticles is shown to contain effects of rainbow scattering and orbiting,\nwhereas with positively charged particles none of these effects arise within\nthe given model. The model predictions are compared with experimental results\nand numerical simulations. Estimates of the volume reflection mean angle and\nthe final beam profile robustness under multiple scattering are performed.\n", "  In this paper we sum up our works on multiscale programs, mainly simulations.\nWe first start with describing what multiscaling is about, how it helps\nperceiving signal from a background noise in a ?ow of data for example, for a\ndirect perception by a user or for a further use by another program. We then\ngive three examples of multiscale techniques we used in the past, maintaining a\nsummary, using an environmental marker introducing an history in the data and\nfinally using a knowledge on the behavior of the different scales to really\nhandle them at the same time.\n", "  The Fe3+ lattice in the Bi2Fe4O9 compound is found to materialize the first\nanalogue of a magnetic pentagonal lattice. Due to its odd number of bonds per\nelemental brick, this lattice, subject to first neighbor antiferromagnetic\ninteractions, is prone to geometric frustration. The Bi2Fe4O9 magnetic\nproperties have been investigated by macroscopic magnetic measurements and\nneutron diffraction. The observed non-collinear magnetic arrangement is related\nto the one stabilized on a perfect tiling as obtained from a mean field\nanalysis with direct space magnetic configurations calculations. The\npeculiarity of this structure arises from the complex connectivity of the\npentagonal lattice, a novel feature compared to the well-known case of\ntriangle-based lattices.\n", "  The controlled and coherent manipulation of individual quantum systems is a\nfundamental key for the development of quantum information processing. The\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond is a promising system since its\nphotoluminescence is perfectly stable at room temperature and its electron spin\ncan be optically read-out at the individual level. We review here the\nexperiments currently realized in our laboratory, concerning the use of single\nNV color center as single photon source and the coherent magnetic manipulation\nof the electron spin associated to a single NV color center. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate a nanoscopy experiment based on saturation absorption effect, which\nallows to optically pin-point single NV color center at a sub-? resolution.\nThis opens a possibility to independently address two or multiple\nmagnetically-coupled single NV color centers, which is a necessary step toward\nthe realization of a diamond-based quantum computer.\n", "  We extend Quantum Dimer Model (QDM) introduced by Rokhsar and Kivelson in\nsuch a way that the model includes resonance processes on larger loops. The\nstrategy is to first construct a pseudo spin Hamiltonian which is defined not\nby the S =1/2 but by the S=1 representation and then establish the\ncorrespondence between the pseudo-spin-1 configurations and those of dimers.\nThe standard QDM keeps only the lowest resonance processes for pairs of\nparallel dimers and its validity in describing the realistic spin systems is\nnot obvious. Our extended QDM (EQDM) improves this point and contains a novel\nresonance term, which is equivalent to two successive actions of the familiar\nparallel dimer resonance. For a certain choice of the coupling constants, our\nmodel exhibits three exotic valence-bond phases (herringbone, checkerboard and\n'dimer smectic') in the ground state, which meet at a triple point. The\ncheckerboard phase has four-fold rotational symmetry, while the dimer smectic\nis characterized by partial ordering only in one of the two directions. In the\ndimer smectic phase, we investigate the dimer-dimer correlation by using an\nanalogy to random walks.\n", "  FBS0107-082 is an emission line object previously classified as a nova-like\ncataclysmic variable star. New optical spectroscopy shows very strong hydrogen\nBalmer lines, along with a nebular forbidden line spectrum and absorption\nfeatures from an early-F photosphere. When combined with other IR and optical\ndata from the literature, these data point to the object being a symbiotic nova\nseen in a prolonged outburst. Photometry on time scales of minutes, days, and\nyears show only very weak variability.\n", "  We use the Science Demonstration Phase data of the Herschel Virgo Cluster\nSurvey to search for dust emission of early-type dwarf galaxies in the central\nregions of the Virgo Cluster as an alternative way of identifying the\ninterstellar medium.We present the first possible far-infrared detection of\ncluster early-type dwarf galaxies: VCC781 and VCC951 are detected at the 10\nsigma level in the SPIRE 250 micron image. Both detected galaxies have dust\nmasses of the order of 10^5 Msun and average dust temperatures ~20K. The\ndetection rate (less than 1%) is quite high compared to the 1.7% detection rate\nfor Hi emission, considering that dwarfs in the central regions are more Hi\ndeficient. We conclude that the removal of interstellar dust from dwarf\ngalaxies resulting from ram pressure stripping, harassment, or tidal effects\nmust be as efficient as the removal of interstellar gas.\n", "  The deconfinement phase transition which happens in the interior of neutron\nstars are investigated. Coupled with the spin evolution of the stars, the\neffect of entropy production and deconfinement heat generation during the\ndeconfinement phase transition in the mixed phase of the neutron stars are\ndiscussed. The entropy production of deconfinement phase transition can be act\nas a signature of phase transition, but less important and does not\nsignificantly change the thermal evolution of neutron stars. The deconfinement\nheat can change the thermal evolution of neutron star distinctly.\n", "  A simple formula to read out the weak value from the wave function of the\nmeasuring device after the postselection with the initial Gaussian profile is\nproposed. We apply this formula for the weak value to the classical experiment\nof the realization of the weak measurement by the optical polarization and\nobtain the weak value for any pre- and post-selections. This formula\nautomatically includes the interference effect which is necessary to yields the\nweak value as an outcome of the weak measurement.\n", "  We investigate the spin- and energy dependent tunneling through a single\norganic molecule (CoPc) adsorbed on a ferromagnetic Fe thin film, spatially\nresolved by low-temperature spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy.\nInterestingly, the metal ion as well as the organic ligand show a significant\nspin-dependence of tunneling current flow. State-of-the-art ab initio\ncalculations including also van-der-Waals interactions reveal a strong\nhybridization of molecular orbitals and surface 3d states. The molecule is\nanionic due to a transfer of one electron, resulting in a non-magnetic (S= 0)\nstate. Nevertheless, tunneling through the molecule exhibits a pronounced\nspin-dependence due to spin-split molecule-surface hybrid states.\n", "  We study horizontal supergranule-scale motions revealed by TRACE observation\nof the chromospheric emission, and investigate the coupling between the\nchromosphere and the underlying photosphere. A highly efficient\nfeature-tracking technique called balltracking has been applied for the first\ntime to the image sequences obtained by TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal\nExplorer) in the passband of white light and the three ultraviolet passbands\ncentered at 1700 {\\AA}, 1600 {\\AA}, and 1550 {\\AA}. The resulting velocity\nfields have been spatially smoothed and temporally averaged in order to reveal\nhorizontal supergranule-scale motions that may exist at the emission heights of\nthese passbands. We find indeed a high correlation between the horizontal\nvelocities derived in the white-light and ultraviolet passbands. The horizontal\nvelocities derived from the chromospheric and photospheric emission are\ncomparable in magnitude. The horizontal motions derived in the UV passbands\nmight indicate the existence of a supergranule-scale magnetoconvection in the\nchromosphere, which may shed new light on the study of mass and energy supply\nto the corona and solar wind at the height of the chromosphere. However, it is\nalso possible that the apparent motions reflect the chromospheric brightness\nevolution as produced by acoustic shocks which might be modulated by the\nphotospheric granular motions in their excitation process, or advected partly\nby the supergranule-scale flow towards the network while propagating upward\nfrom the photosphere. To reach a firm conclusion, it is necessary to\ninvestigate the role of granular motions in the excitation of shocks through\nnumerical modeling, and future high-cadence chromospheric magnetograms must be\nscrutinized.\n", "  Heavy flavor hadrons, i.e. those containing charm and bottom quarks, will be\nabundantly produced at the LHC and are important probes of the Quark-Gluon\nPlasma (QGP). Of particular interest is the investigation of parton energy loss\nin the medium. Using heavy flavor jets we will have a pure sample of quark jets\nwith which to study the color-charge effects on energy loss. In addition,\nstudies of bottom production in p+p collision at LHC energies will be utilized\nto further constrain the current parameters used by NLO and FONLL calculations.\nThe talk will focus on the very high-pt electron particle identification using\nthe EMCal detector. We present the electron reconstruction and measurements\nwhich can be achieved with 1 nominal year of Pb-Pb running at 5.5 TeV. We then\nestimate the rate of non-photonic electrons and present systematic and\nstatistical error bars. Finally, we show preliminary results on B-jet tagging\ntechniques in p+p which utilize jet-finding algorithms (FASTJET) in conjunction\nwith displaced secondary vertices containing high-pt electrons.\n", "  The time evolution of the entanglement of a pair of two spin qubits is\ninvestigated when the two qubits simultaneously couple to an environment of an\nanisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. The entanglement of the two spin qubits\ncan be created and is a periodic function of the time if the magnetic field is\ngreater than a critical value. If the two spin qubits are in the Bell state,\nthe entanglement can be stored with relatively large value even when the\nmagnetic field is large.\n", "  Topological insulators in three dimensions are characterized by a Z2-valued\ntopological invariant, which consists of a strong index and three weak indices.\nIn the presence of disorder, only the strong index survives. This paper studies\nthe topological invariant in disordered three-dimensional system by viewing it\nas a super-cell of an infinite periodic system. As an application of this\nmethod we show that the strong index becomes non-trivial when strong enough\ndisorder is introduced into a trivial insulator with spin-orbit coupling,\nrealizing a strong topological Anderson insulator. We also numerically extract\nthe gap range and determine the phase boundaries of this topological phase,\nwhich ?ts well with those obtained from self-consistent Born approximation\n(SCBA) and the transport calculations.\n", "  Nonlocality and quantum entanglement constitute two special features of\nquantum systems of paramount importance in quantum information theory (QIT).\nEssentially regarded as identical or equivalent for many years, they constitute\ndifferent concepts. Describing nonlocality by means of the maximal violation of\ntwo Bell inequalities, we study both entanglement and nonlocality for two and\nthree spins in the XY model. Our results shed a new light into the description\nof nonlocality and the possible information-theoretic task limitations of\nentanglement in an infinite quantum system.\n", "  We analytically work out the cumulative, i.e. averaged over one orbital\nrevolution, time variations of the radial velocity v_r of a typical S star\norbiting the Supermassive Black Hole (SBH) hosted by the Galactic Center (GC)\nin Sgr A* caused by several dynamical effects. They are the general\nrelativistic gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) fields of the SBH, its quadrupole\nmass moment Q2, and a diffuse dark matter distribution around the SBH. All of\nthem induce non-zero secular radial accelerations proportional to the\neccentricity e of the orbit. By taking the S2 star, orbiting the SBH along a\nhighly eccentric (e = 0.8831) ellipse with a period Pb = 15.9 yr, we\nnumerically compute the magnitudes of its radial accelerations (Abridged).\n", "  Because scaling symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are generally not\nvariational symmetries of the action, they do not lead to conservation laws.\nInstead, an extension of Noether's theorem reduces the equations of motion to\nevolutionary laws that prove useful, even if the transformations are not\ngeneralized symmetries of the equations of motion. In the case of scaling,\nsymmetry leads to a scaling evolutionary law, a first-order equation in terms\nof scale invariants, linearly relating kinematic and dynamic degrees of\nfreedom.\n  This scaling evolutionary law appears in dynamical and in static systems.\nApplied to dynamical central-force systems, the scaling evolutionary equation\nleads to generalized virial laws, which linearly connect the kinetic and\npotential energies. Applied to barotropic hydrostatic spheres, the scaling\nevolutionary equation linearly connects the gravitational and internal energy\ndensities. This implies well-known properties of polytropes, describing\ndegenerate stars and chemically homogeneous non-degenerate stellar cores.\n", "  We investigate graphene superlattices of nitrogen and boron substitutional\ndefects and by using symmetry arguments and electronic structure calculations\nwe show how such superlattices can be used to modify graphene band structure.\nSpecifically, depending on the superlattice symmetry, the structures considered\nhere can either preserve the Dirac cones (D_{6h} superlattices) or open a band\ngap (D_{3h}). Relevant band parameters (carriers effective masses, group\nvelocities and gaps, when present) are found to depend on the superlattice\nconstant n as 1/n^{p} where p is in the range 1-2, depending on the case\nconsidered. Overall, the results presented here show how one can tune the\ngraphene band structure to a great extent by modifying few superlattice\nparameters.\n", "  We demonstrate all optical electron spin initialization, storage and readout\nin a single self-assembled InGaAs quantum dot. Using a single dot charge\nstorage device we monitor the relaxation of a single electron over long\ntimescales exceeding 40{\\mu}s. The selective generation of a single electron in\nthe quantum dot is performed by resonant optical excitation and subsequent\npartial exciton ionization; the hole is removed from the quantum dot whilst the\nelectron remains stored. When subject to a magnetic field applied in Faraday\ngeometry, we show how the spin of the electron can be prepared with a\npolarization up to 65% simply by controlling the voltage applied to the gate\nelectrode. After generation, the electron spin is stored in the quantum dot\nbefore being read out using an all optical implementation of spin to charge\nconversion technique, whereby the spin projection of the electron is mapped\nonto the more robust charge state of the quantum dot. After spin to charge\nconversion, the charge state of the dot is repeatedly tested by pumping a\nluminescence recycling transition to obtain strong readout signals. In\ncombination with spin manipulation using fast optical pulses or microwave\npulses, this provides an ideal basis for probing spin coherence in single\nself-assembled quantum dots over long timescales and developing optimal methods\nfor coherent spin control.\n", "  In this paper we study homogeneous Gibbs measures on a Cayley tree, subjected\nto an infinite-temperature Glauber evolution, and consider their (non-)Gibbsian\nproperties. We show that the intermediate Gibbs state (which in zero field is\nthe free-boundary-condition Gibbs state) behaves different from the plus and\nthe minus state. E.g. at large times, all configurations are bad for the\nintermediate state, whereas the plus configuration never is bad for the plus\nstate. Moreover, we show that for each state there are two transitions. For the\nintermediate state there is a transition from a Gibbsian regime to a\nnon-Gibbsian regime where some, but not all configurations are bad, and a\nsecond one to a regime where all configurations are bad. For the plus and minus\nstate, the two transitions are from a Gibbsian regime to a non-Gibbsian one and\nthen back to a Gibbsian regime again.\n", "  Using synthetic spectra to gauge the observational consequences of altering\nthe abundance of individual elements, I determine the observability of new Lick\nIDS style indices designed to target individual elements. Then using these new\nindices and single stellar population models, I investigate a new method to\ndetermine Balmer series emission in a Sloan Digital Sky Surveys grand average\nof quiescent galaxies. I also investigate the effects of an old metal-poor\nstellar population on the near ultra violet spectrum through the use of these\nnew indices and find that the presence of a small old metal-poor population\naccounts for discrepancies observed between index trends in the near UV and\noptical spectral regimes. Index trends for 74 indices and three data sets are\npresented and discussed. Finally, I determine the near nuclear line-strength\ngradients of 18 red sequence elliptical Virgo cluster galaxies for 74 indices.\n", "  In this paper we take an idea presented in recent paper by Carlen, Carvalho,\nLe Roux, Loss, and Villani and push it one step forward to find an exact\nestimation on the entropy production. The new estimation essentially proves\nthat Villani's conjecture is correct, or more precisely that a much worse bound\nto the entropy production is impossible in the general case.\n", "  Dispersive averaging effects are used to show that KdV equation with periodic\nboundary conditions possesses high frequency solutions which behave nearly\nlinearly. Numerical simulations are presented which indicate high accuracy of\nthis approximation. Furthermore, this result is applied to shallow water wave\ndynamics in the limit of KdV approximation, which is obtained by asymptotic\nanalysis in combination with numerical simulations of KdV.\n", "  We unzip DNA molecules using optical tweezers and determine the sizes of the\ncooperatively unzipping and zipping regions separating consecutive metastable\nintermediates along the unzipping pathway. Sizes are found to be distributed\nfollowing a power law, ranging from one base pair up to more than a hundred\nbase pairs. We find that a large fraction of unzipping regions smaller than 10\nbp are seldom detected because of the high compliance of the released single\nstranded DNA. We show how the compliance of a single nucleotide sets a limit\nvalue around 0.1 N/m for the stiffness of any local force probe aiming to\ndiscriminate one base pair at a time in DNA unzipping experiments.\n", "  Context. Asteroseismology is an effcient tool not only for testing stellar\nstructure and evolutionary theory but also constraining the parameters of stars\nfor which solar-like oscillations are detected, presently. As an important\nsouthern asteroseismic target, Tau Ceti, is a metal-poor star. The main\nfeatures of the oscillations and some frequencies of ? Ceti have been\nidentified. Many scientists propose to comprehensively observe this star as\npart of the Stellar Observations Network Group. Aims. Our goal is to obtain the\noptimal model and reliable fundamental parameters for the metal-poor star Tau\nCeti by combining all non-asteroseismic observations with these seismological\ndata. Methods. Using the Yale stellar evolution code (YREC), a grid of stellar\nmodel candidates that fall within all the error boxes in the HR diagram have\nbeen constructed, and both the model frequencies and large- and small-\nfrequency separations are calculated using the Guenther's stellar pulsation\ncode. The \\chi2c minimization is performed to identify the optimal modelling\nparameters that reproduce the observations within their errors. The frequency\ncorrections of near-surface effects to the calculated frequencies using the\nempirical law, as proposed by Kjeldsen and coworkers, are applied to the\nmodels. Results. We derive optimal models, corresponding to masses of about\n0.775 - 0.785 M? and ages of about 8 - 10 Gyr. Furthermore, we find that the\nquantities derived from the non-asteroseismic observations (effective\ntemperature and luminosity) acquired spectroscopically are more accurate than\nthose inferred from interferometry for ? Ceti, because our optimal models are\nin the error boxes B and C, which are derived from spectroscopy results.\n", "  Chemical reaction rates often depend strongly on stereodynamics, namely the\norientation and movement of molecules in three-dimensional space. An ultracold\nmolecular gas, with a temperature below 1 uK, provides a highly unusual regime\nfor chemistry, where polar molecules can easily be oriented using an external\nelectric field and where, moreover, the motion of two colliding molecules is\nstrictly quantized. Recently, atom-exchange reactions were observed in a\ntrapped ultracold gas of KRb molecules. In an external electric field, these\nexothermic and barrierless bimolecular reactions, KRb+KRb -> K2+Rb2, occur at a\nrate that rises steeply with increasing dipole moment. Here we show that the\nquantum stereodynamics of the ultracold collisions can be exploited to suppress\nthe bimolecular chemical reaction rate by nearly two orders of magnitude. We\nuse an optical lattice trap to confine the fermionic polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional, pancake-like geometry, with the dipoles oriented along\nthe tight confinement direction. With the combination of sufficiently tight\nconfinement and Fermi statistics of the molecules, two polar molecules can\napproach each other only in a \"side-by-side\" collision, where the chemical\nreaction rate is suppressed by the repulsive dipole-dipole interaction. We show\nthat the suppression of the bimolecular reaction rate requires quantum-state\ncontrol of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the molecules.\nThe suppression of chemical reactions for polar molecules in a\nquasi-two-dimensional trap opens the way for investigation of a dipolar\nmolecular quantum gas. Because of the strong, long-range character of the\ndipole-dipole interactions, such a gas brings fundamentally new abilities to\nquantum-gas-based studies of strongly correlated many-body physics, where\nquantum phase transitions and new states of matter can emerge.\n", "  We use high-temperature series expansions to obtain thermodynamic properties\nof the quantum compass model, and to investigate the phase transition on the\nsquare and simple cubic lattices. On the square lattice we obtain evidence for\na phase transition, consistent with recent Monte Carlo results. On the simple\ncubic lattice the same procedure provides no sign of a transition, and we\nconjecture that there is no finite temperature transition in this case.\n", "  Employing the interband exciton scattering model, we have performed a\nnumerical study of the direct photogeneration and population relaxation\nprocesses contributing to carrier multiplication (CM) in nanocrystalline and\nbulk PbSe. We argue that in both cases the impact ionization is the main\nmechanisms of CM. This explains weak contribution of the direct photogeneration\nto the total quantum efficiency (QE). Investigated size scaling of QE in NCs\nand comparison to the bulk limit provide microscopic insight in the\nexperimentally observed trends.\n", "  This paper discusses the observed at rotation curves of galaxies in the\ncontext of noncommutative geometry. The energy density of such a geometry is\ndiffused throughout a region due to the uncertainty encoded in the coordinate\ncommutator. This intrinsic property appears to be sufficient for producing\nstable circular orbits, as well as attractive gravity, without the need for\ndark matter.\n", "  The observation that the thermal conductivity of single-crystalline silicon\nnanowires with diameter on the length scale of 25 nm is lower than that of bulk\nmaterial by two orders of magnitude has attracted the interest onto silicon as\na potentially effective thermoelectric material. However, the potential\ninterest has a hope of transforming in a practical interest only if\npoly-crystalline silicon can replace single crystalline silicon and the\npreparation of nanowires does not involve any advanced photolithography. In\nthis work we show that a technique, based on the controlled etching and filling\nof recessed regions and employing standard photolithography and\ndeposition-etching methods, succeeds in the preparation of poly-crystalline\nsilicon nanowires (with diameter of 25 nm and length on the centimetre scale)\nat a linear density of 3E6 cm^-1.\n", "  This paper concerns hylomorphic solitons, namely stable, solitary waves whose\nexistence is related to the ratio energy/charge. In theoretical physics, the\nname Q-ball refers to a type of hylomorphic solitons or soli- tary waves\nrelative to the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKG). We are interested in the\nexistence of charged Q-balls, namely Q-balls for the Nonlinear Klein-Gordon\nequation coupled with the Maxwell equations (NKGM). In this case the charge\nreduces to the electric charge. The main result of this paper establishes that\nstable, charged Q-balls exist provided that the interaction between matter and\nthe gauge field is sufficiently small.\n", "  We explore the possibility of inducing a topological insulator phase in a\nhoneycomb lattice lacking spin-orbit interaction using a metallic (or Fermi\ngas) environment. The lattice and the metallic environment interact through a\ndensity-density interaction without particle tunneling, and integrating out the\nmetallic environment produces a honeycomb sheet with in-plane oscillating\nlong-ranged interactions. We find the ground state of the interacting system in\na variational mean-field method and show that the Fermi wave vector, kF, of the\nmetal determines which phase occurs in the honeycomb lattice sheet. This is\nanalogous to the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism in which the\nmetal's kF determines the interaction profile as a function of the distance.\nTuning kF and the interaction strength may lead to a variety of ordered phases,\nincluding a topological insulator and anomalous quantum-hall states with\ncomplex next-nearest-neighbor hopping, as in the Haldane and the Kane-Mele\nmodel. We estimate the required range of parameters needed for the topological\nstate and find that the Fermi vector of the metallic gate should be of the\norder of 3Pi/8a (with a being the graphene lattice constant). The net coupling\nbetween the layers, which includes screening in the metal, should be of the\norder of the honeycomb lattice bandwidth. This configuration should be most\neasily realized in a cold-atoms setting with two interacting Fermionic species.\n", "  Purpose: Many planning methods for high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy\ntreatment planning require an iterative approach. A set of computational\nparameters are hypothesized that will give a dose plan that meets dosimetric\ncriteria. A dose plan is computed using these parameters, and if any dosimetric\ncriteria are not met, the process is iterated until a suitable dose plan is\nfound. In this way, the dose distribution is controlled by abstract parameters.\nThe purpose of this study is to improve HDR brachytherapy planning by\ndeveloping a new approach that directly optimizes the dose distribution based\non dosimetric criteria.\n  Method: We develop Inverse Planning by Integer Program (IPIP), an\noptimization model for computing HDR brachytherapy dose plans and a fast\nheuristic for it. We used our heuristic to compute dose plans for 20 anonymized\nprostate cancer patient image data sets from our clinic database. Dosimetry was\nevaluated and compared to dosimetric criteria.\n  Results: Dose plans computed from IPIP satisfied all given dosimetric\ncriteria for the target and healthy tissue after a single iteration. The\naverage target coverage was 95%. The average computation time for IPIP was 30.1\nseconds on a Intel(R) CoreTM2 Duo CPU 1.67 GHz processor with 3 Gib RAM.\n  Conclusion: IPIP is an HDR brachytherapy planning system that directly\nincorporates dosimetric criteria. We have demonstrated that IPIP has clinically\nacceptable performance for the prostate cases and dosimetric criteria used in\nthis study, both in terms of dosimetry and runtime. Further study is required\nto determine if IPIP performs well for a more general group of patients and\ndosimetric criteria, including other cancer sites such as GYN.\n", "  The Calar Alto Observatory, located at 2168m height above the sea level in\ncontinental Europe, holds a significant number of astronomical telescopes and\nexperiments, covering a large range of the electromagnetic domain, from\ngamma-ray to near-infrared. It is a very well characterized site, with\nexcellent logistics. Its main telescopes includes a large suite of instruments.\nAt the present time, new instruments, namely CAFE, PANIC and Carmenes, are\nunder development. We are also planning a new operational scheme in order to\noptimize the observatory resources.\n", "  We present the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey (CALIFA).\nCALIFA's main aim is to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopic information for\n~600 galaxies of all Hubble types in the Local Universe (0.005< z <0.03). The\nsurvey has been designed to allow three key measurements to be made: (a)\nTwo-dimensional maps of stellar populations (star formation histories, chemical\nelements); (b) The distribution of the excitation mechanism and element\nabundances of the ionized gas; and (c) Kinematic properties (velocity fields,\nvelocity dispersion), both from emission and from absorption lines. To cover\nthe full optical extension of the target galaxies (i.e. out to a 3sigma depth\nof ~23 mag/arcsec2), CALIFA uses the exceptionally large field of view of the\nPPAK/PMAS IFU at the 3.5m telescope of the Calar Alto observatory. We use two\ngrating setups, one covering the wavelength range between 3700 and 5000 AA at a\nspectral resolution R~1650, and the other covering 4300 to 7000 AA at R~850.\nThe survey was allocated 210 dark nights, distributed in 6 semesters and\nstarting in July 2010 and is carried out by the CALIFA collaboration,\ncomprising ~70 astronomers from 8 different countries. As a legacy survey, the\nfully reduced data will be made publically available, once their quality has\nbeen verified. We showcase here early results obtained from the data taken so\nfar (21 galaxies).\n", "  In deriving large n probability distribution function of the rightmost\neigenvalue from the classical Random Matrix Theory Ensembles, one is faced with\nque question of finding large n asymptotic of certain coupled set of functions.\nThis paper presents some of these functions in a new light.\n", "  We consider a pure 2m-qubit initial state to evolve under a particular\nquantum me- chanical spin Hamiltonian, which can be written in terms of the\nadjacency matrix of the Johnson network J(2m;m). Then, by using some techniques\nsuch as spectral dis- tribution and stratification associated with the graphs,\nemployed in [1, 2], a maximally entangled GHZ state is generated between the\nantipodes of the network. In fact, an explicit formula is given for the\nsuitable coupling strengths of the hamiltonian, so that a maximally entangled\nstate can be generated between antipodes of the network. By using some known\nmultipartite entanglement measures, the amount of the entanglement of the final\nevolved state is calculated, and finally two examples of four qubit and six\nqubit states are considered in details.\n", "  The results of studies of 2006 VV2 and 13170 (1999 HF1) binary asteroids of\nNEA group, (45) Eugenia and (87) Sylvia triple asteroids, (762) Pulcova and\n(90) Antiope binary asteroids of the Main Belt are presented. For the asteroid\n2006 VV2, color indices (B-V, V-R, R-I), the absolute magnitude (16.7 \\pm\n0.2m), a taxonomy class, the density (2.71 \\pm 0.04 g/cm3), the masses of\ncomponents as well as refined form of the main component and the satellite\norbit were determined. For the (45) Eugenia asteroid, refined form the main\ncomponent, simulated orbits of both satellites were determined and it was\nshowed that the axis of rotation of the main component undergoes a forced\nprecession with an angle of 10 deg and a period of 66 days. Based on a\ncomparison of model lightcurves with observations over a long interval of time\nof (90) Antiope asteroid, reflective surface properties of its components were\ninvestigated. For asteroid (762) Pulcova, form of the main component was\ndetermined and the reflective properties of its surface were investigated. For\nasteroid 137170 (1999 HF1), estimates of the size of the main component (a =\n2.12 \\pm 0.02, b = 1.77 \\pm 0.01, c = 1.73 \\pm 0.03 km) were made and possible\nstable orbit of the satellite (with the elements of a~6.2 km, e~0.1, i~2 deg)\nwas identified and of component masses were estimated. For the asteroid (87)\nSylvia, form the main component was refined.\n", "  We present a study on the clustering of a stellar mass selected sample of\ngalaxies with stellar masses M*>10^10Msol at redshifts 0.4<z<2.0, taken from\nthe Palomar Observatory Wide-field Infrared Survey. We examine the clustering\nproperties of these stellar mass selected samples as a function of redshift and\nstellar mass, and find that galaxies with high stellar masses have a\nprogressively higher clustering strength than galaxies with lower stellar\nmasses. We also find that galaxies within a fixed stellar mass range have a\nhigher clustering strength at higher redshifts. We further estimate the average\ntotal masses of the dark matter haloes hosting these stellar-mass selected\ngalaxies. For all galaxies in our sample the stellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio\nis always lower than the universal baryonic mass fraction and the\nstellar-mass-to-total-mass ratio is strongly correlated with the halo masses\nfor central galaxies, such that more massive haloes contain a lower fraction of\ntheir mass in the form of stars. The remaining baryonic mass is included\npartially in stars within satellite galaxies in these haloes, and as diffuse\nhot and warm gas. We also find that, at a fixed stellar mass, the\nstellar-to-total-mass ratio increases at lower redshifts. This suggests that\ngalaxies at a fixed stellar mass form later in lower mass dark matter haloes,\nand earlier in massive haloes. We interpret this as a `halo downsizing' effect.\n", "  We have studied a GaAs-AlAs planar microcavity with a resonance near 1300 nm\nin the telecom range by ultrafast pump-probe reflectivity. By the judicious\nchoice of pump frequency, we observe a ultimate fast and reversible decrease of\nthe resonance frequency by more than half a linewidth due to the instantaneous\nelectronic Kerr effect. The switch-on and switch-off? of the cavity is only\nlimited by the cavity storage time of ?tcav = 0.3ps and not by intrinsic\nmaterial parameters. Our results pave the way to supra-THz switching rates for\non-chip data modulation and real-time cavity quantum electrodynamics.\n", "  Dilation and thermopower measurements on YbAgGe, a heavy-fermion\nantiferromagnet, clarify and refine the magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase\ndiagram and reveal a field-induced phase with T-linear resistivity. On the\nlow-H side of this phase we find evidence for a first-order transition and\nsuggest that YbAgGe at 4.5 T may be close to a quantum critical end point. On\nthe high-H side our results are consistent with a second-order transition\nsuppressed to a quantum critical point near 7.2 T. We discuss these results in\nlight of global phase diagrams proposed for Kondo lattice systems.\n", "  We employ classical molecular dynamics to study the nonlinear thermal\ntransport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). For GNRs under large temperature\nbiases beyond linear response regime, we have observed the onset of negative\ndifferential thermal conductance (NDTC). NDTC is tunable by varying the manner\nof applying the temperature biases. NDTC is reduced and eventually disappears\nwhen the length of the GNR increases. We have also observed NDTC in triangular\nGNRs, where NDTC exists only when the heat current is from the narrower to the\nwider end. These effects may be useful in nanoscale thermal managements and\nthermal signal processing utilizing GNRs.\n", "  Two distinct mechanisms for filtering noise in an input signal are identified\nin a class of adaptive sensory networks. We find that the high frequency noise\nis filtered by the output degradation process through time-averaging; while the\nlow frequency noise is damped by adaptation through negative feedback. Both\nfiltering processes themselves introduce intrinsic noises, which are found to\nbe unfiltered and can thus amount to a significant internal noise floor even\nwithout signaling. These results are applied to E. coli chemotaxis. We show\nunambiguously that the molecular mechanism for the Berg-Purcell time-averaging\nscheme is the dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY-P, not the\nreceptor adaptation process as previously suggested. The high frequency noise\ndue to the stochastic ligand binding-unbinding events and the random ligand\nmolecule diffusion is averaged by the CheY-P dephosphorylation process to a\nnegligible level in E.coli. We identify a previously unstudied noise source\ncaused by the random motion of the cell in a ligand gradient. We show that this\nrandom walk induced signal noise has a divergent low frequency component, which\nis only rendered finite by the receptor adaptation process. For gradients\nwithin the E. coli sensing range, this dominant external noise can be\ncomparable to the significant intrinsic noise in the system. The dependence of\nthe response and its fluctuations on the key time scales of the system are\nstudied systematically. We show that the chemotaxis pathway may have evolved to\noptimize gradient sensing, strong response, and noise control in different time\nscales\n", "  We have calculated the properties of SrTiO3 (STO) using a wide array of\ndensity functionals ranging from standard semi-local functionals to modern\nrange-separated hybrids, combined with several basis sets of varying\nsize/quality. We show how these combination's predictive ability varies\nsignificantly, both for STO's cubic and antiferrodistortive (AFD) phases, with\nthe greatest variation in functional/basis set efficacy seen in modeling the\nAFD phase. The screened hybrid functionals we utilized predict the structural\nproperties of both phases in very good agreement with experiment, especially if\nused with large (but still computationally tractable) basis sets. The most\naccurate results presented in this study, namely those from\nHSE06/modified-def2-TZVP, stand as the most accurate modeling of STO to date\nwhen compared to the literature; these results agree well with experimental\nstructural and electronic properties as well as providing insight into the band\nstructure alteration during the phase transition.\n", "  We reconsider the lambda-SUSY model, in which the mass of the Higgs boson is\nraised already at tree level up to about 200 GeV via an additional interaction\nin the superpotential between the Higgs bosons and a Singlet, focusing on a\nscale invariant superpotential. After a detailed analysis of the allowed region\nin parameter space, which includes constraints coming from the absence of\nspontaneous CP violation and of unrealistic minima, we study the scalar mass\nspectrum, the production rate and the decay modes of the lightest scalar,\nfinding that in general both the production rate and the Branching Ratio into\ngauge bosons can be reduced with respect of those of the standard Higgs,\ncausing it to be hardly detected in the first run of the LHC.\n", "  A method for the homogenization of 3-D periodic elastic composites is\npresented. It allows for the evaluation of the averaged overall frequency\ndependent dynamic material constitutive tensors relating the averaged dynamic\nfield variable tensors of velocity, strain, stress, and linear momentum. The\nformulation is based on micromechanical modeling of a representative unit cell\nof a composite proposed by Nemat-Nasser & Hori (1993), Nemat-Nasser et. al.\n(1982) and Mura (1987) and is the 3-D generalization of the 1-D elastodynamic\nhomogenization scheme presented by Nemat-Nasser & Srivastava (2011). We show\nthat for 3-D periodic composites the overall compliance (stiffness) tensor is\nhermitian, irrespective of whether the corresponding unit cell is geometrically\nor materially symmetric.Overall mass density is shown to be a tensor and, like\nthe overall compliance tensor, always hermitian. The average strain and linear\nmomentum tensors are, however, coupled and the coupling tensors are shown to be\neach others' hermitian transpose. Finally we present a numerical example of a\n3-D periodic composite composed of elastic cubes periodically distributed in an\nelastic matrix. The presented results corroborate the predictions of the\ntheoretical treatment.\n", "  We investigate the spontaneous generation of crystallized topological defects\nvia the combining effects of fast rotation and rapid thermal quench on the\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. By solving the stochastic projected\nGross-Pitaevskii equation, we show that, when the system reaches equilibrium, a\nhexagonal lattice of skyrmions, and a square lattice of half-quantized vortices\ncan be formed in a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spinor BEC, respetively,\nwhich can be imaged by using the polarization-dependent phase-contrast method.\n", "  We investigate the optical properties of bromine intercalated highly\norientated pyrolytic graphite (Br-HOPG) and provide a novel interpretation of\nthe data. We observe new absorption features below 620 meV which are absent in\nthe absorption spectrum of graphite. Comparing our results with those of\ntheoretical studies on graphite, single and bilayer graphene as well as recent\noptical studies of multilayer graphene, we conclude that Br-HOPG contains the\nsignatures of ultrapure bilayer, single layer graphene, and graphite. The\nobserved supermetallic conductivity of Br-HOPG is identified with the presence\nof very high mobility (~ 121,000 cm2V-1s-1 at room temperature and at very high\ncarrier density) multilayer graphene components in our sample. This could\nprovide a new avenue for single and multilayer graphene research.\n", "  Using the necessary and sufficient conditions, minimum error discrimination\namong two sets of similarity transformed equiprobable quantum qudit states is\ninvestigated. In the case that the unitary operators are generating sets of two\nirreducible representations, the optimal set of measurements and the\ncorresponding maximum success probability of discrimination are determined in\nclosed form. In the case of reducible representations, there exists no\nclosed-form formula in general, but the procedure can be applied in each case\naccordingly. Finally, we give the maximum success probability of optimal\ndiscrimination for some important examples of mixed quantum states, such as\nqubit states together with three special cases and generalized Bloch sphere\nm-qubit states.\n", "  Coherent states play an important role in quantum mechanics because of their\nunique properties under time evolution. Here we explore this concept for\none-dimensional repulsive nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations, which describe\nweakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or light propagation in a\nnonlinear medium. It is shown that the dynamics of phase-space translations of\nthe ground state of a harmonic potential is quite simple: the centre follows a\nclassical trajectory whereas its shape does not vary in time. The parabolic\npotential is the only one that satisfies this property. We study the time\nevolution of these nonlinear coherent states under perturbations of their\nshape, or of the confining potential. A rich variety of effects emerges. In\nparticular, in the presence of anharmonicities, we observe that the packet\nsplits into two distinct components. A fraction of the condensate is\ntransferred towards uncoherent high-energy modes, while the amplitude of\noscillation of the remaining coherent component is damped towards the bottom of\nthe well.\n", "  We study the anisotropic in-plane optical conductivity of detwinned\nBa(Fe1-xCox)2As2 single crystals for x=0, 2.5% and 4.5% in a broad energy range\n(3 meV-5 eV) across their structural and magnetic transitions. For temperatures\nbelow the Neel transition, the topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface,\ncombined with the distinct behavior of the scattering rates, determines the\nanisotropy of the low frequency optical response. For the itinerant charge\ncarriers, we are able to disentangle the evolution of the Drude weights and\nscattering rates and to observe their enhancement along the orthorhombic\nantiferromagnetic a-axis with respect to the ferromagnetic b-axis. For\ntemperatures above Ts, uniaxial stress leads to a finite in-plane anisotropy.\nThe anisotropy of the optical conductivity, leading to a significant dichroism,\nextends to high frequencies in the mid- and near-infrared regions. The\ntemperature dependence of the dichroism at all dopings scales with the\nanisotropy ratio of the dc conductivity, suggesting the electronic nature of\nthe structural transition. Our findings bear testimony to a large nematic\nsusceptibility that couples very effectively to the uniaxial lattice strain. In\norder to clarify the subtle interplay of magnetism and Fermi surface topology\nwe compare our results with theoretical calculations obtained from density\nfunctional theory within the full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method.\n", "  In this letter, we have considered generalized Ricci dark energy in the\nHorava-Lifshitz gravity. We have reconstructed the Hubble's parameter in terms\nof fractional densities. We have viewed the equation of state parameter in this\nsituation. Also, we have examined the behavior of deceleration parameter and\ninvestigated the nature of the statefinder diagnostics. The equation of state\nparameter has exhibited quintessence-like behavior and from the plot of the\ndeceleration parameter we have observed an ever accelerating universe.\n", "  We demonstrate control by applied electric field of the charge states in\nsingle self-assembled InP quantum dots placed in GaInP Schottky structures\ngrown by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. This has been enabled by growth\noptimization leading to suppression of formation of large dots uncontrollably\naccumulating charge. Using bias- and polarization-dependent\nmicro-photoluminescence, we identify the exciton multi-particle states and\ncarry out a systematic study of the neutral exciton state dipole moment and\npolarizability. This analysis allows for the characterization of the exciton\nwavefunction properties at the single dot level for this type of quantum dots.\nPhotocurrent measurements allow further characterization of exciton properties\nby electrical means, opening new possibilities for resonant excitation studies\nfor such system.\n", "  Approximate molecular calculations via standard Kohn-Sham Density Functional\nTheory are exactly reproduced by performing self-consistent calculations on\nisolated fragments via Partition Density Functional Theory [Phys. Rev. A 82,\n024501 (2010)]. We illustrate this with the binding curves of small diatomic\nmolecules. We find that partition energies are in all cases qualitatively\nsimilar and numerically close to actual binding energies. We discuss\nqualitative features of the associated partition potentials.\n", "  The analysis of scattering from complex objects using surface integral\nequations is a challenging problem. Its resolution has wide ranging\napplications- from crack propagation to diagnostic medicine. The two\ningredients of any integral equation methodology is the representation of the\ndomain and the design of approximation spaces to represent physical quantities\non the domain. The order of convergence depends on both the surface and\ngeometry representation. For instance, most surface models are restricted to\npiecewise at or second order tessellations. Similarly, the most commonly known\nbasis spaces for acoustics are piecewise constant functions. What is desirable\nis a framework that permits adaptivity (of size and order) in both geometry and\nfunction representations. Unlike volumetric, differential equation solvers,\nsuch as the finite element method, developing an hpadaptive framework for\nsurface integral equations is very difficult. This papers proposes a resolution\nto this problem by developing a novel framework that relies on reconstruction\nof the surface using locally smooth parameterizations, and defining partition\nof unity functions and higher order basis spaces on overlapping domains. This\npermits easy refinement of both the geometry and function representation. This\ncapabilities of the proposed framework are shown via a number of numerical\nexamples\n", "  First principles based phase diagram calculations were performed for the\noctahedral-interstitial solid solution system \\alpha ZrOX (\\alpha Zr[\n]_(1-X)OX; [ ]=Vacancy; 0 \\leq X \\leq 1/2). The cluster expansion method was\nused to do a ground state analysis, and to calculate the phase diagram. The\npredicted diagram has four ordered ground-states in the range 0 \\leq X \\leq\n1/2, but one of these, at X=5/12, is predicted to disproportionate at T \\approx\n20K, well below the experimentally investigated range T \\approx 420K. Thus, at\nT \\succeq 420K, the first-principles based calculation predicts three ordered\nphases rather than the four that have been reported by experimentalists.\n", "  The two-dimensional one-component plasma at the special coupling \\beta = 2 is\nknown to be exactly solvable, for its free energy and all of its correlations,\non a variety of surfaces and with various boundary conditions. Here we study\nthis system confined to a spherical annulus with soft wall boundary conditions,\npaying special attention to the resulting asymptotic forms from the viewpoint\nof expected general properties of the two-dimensional plasma. Our study is\nmotivated by the realization of the Boltzmann factor for the plasma system with\n\\beta = 2, after stereographic projection from the sphere to the complex plane,\nby a certain random matrix ensemble constructed out of complex Gaussian and\nHaar distributed unitary matrices.\n", "  A model for N2 triplet states band emissions in the Venusian dayglow has been\ndeveloped for low and high solar activity conditions. Steady state\nphotoelectron fluxes and volume excitation rates for N2 triplet states have\nbeen calculated using the Analytical Yield Spectra (AYS) technique. Model\ncalculated photoelectron flux is in good agreement with Pioneer Venus\nOrbiter-observed electron flux. Since inter-state cascading is important for\nthe triplet states of N2, populations of different levels of N2 triplet states\nare calculated under statistical equilibrium considering direct electron impact\nexcitation, and cascading and quenching effects. Densities of all vibrational\nlevels of each triplet state are calculated in the model. Height-integrated\noverhead intensities of N2 triplet band emissions are calculated, the values\nfor Vegard-Kaplan (A^3Sigma_u^+ - X^1Pi_g^+), First Positive (B^3Pi_g -\nA^3Sigma_u^+), Second Positive (C^3Pi_u - B^3Pi_g), and Wu-Benesch (W^3Delta_u\n- B^3Pi_g) bands of N2, are 1.9 (3.2), 3 (6), 0.4 (0.8), and 0.5 (1.1) kR,\nrespectively, for solar minimum (maximum) conditions. The intensities of the\nthree strong Vegard-Kaplan bands (0, 5), (0, 6), and (0, 7) are 94 (160), 120\n(204), and 114 (194) R, respectively, for solar minimum (maximum) conditions.\nLimb profiles are calculated for VK (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) and (0, 7) bands.\nThe calculated intensities on Venus are about a factor 10 higher than those on\nMars. The present study provides a motivation for a search of N2 triplet band\nemissions in the dayglow of Venus.\n", "  Recently Saito & Sirono (2011) proposed that large ice aggregates which drift\nin- wards in protoplanetary disks break up during sublimation, ejecting\nembedded silicate particles. This would lead to a concentration of small solid\nparticles close to the snow- line. In view of this model we carried out\nlaboratory experiments where we observed freely levitating ice aggregates\nsublimating. We find that frequent break up is indeed very common. Scaled to a\n10 cm aggregate about 2x10^4 small silicate aggregates might result. This\nsupports the idea that sublimation of drifting ice aggregates might locally\nincrease the density of small dust (silicate) particles which might more easily\nbe swept up by larger dust aggregates or trigger gravitational instability.\nEither way this might locally boost the formation of planetesimals at the\nsnowline.\n", "  A general expression for calculating the thermal power transferring from\n3-dimensional electron to any D-dimensional phonon subsystem is derived in this\npaper. Electron-phonon coupling in a free suspended cylindrical nanoshell is\nstudied, in which acoustic phonons are confined to quasi-one dimension but\nelectrons behave three-dimensionally. The temperature dependence of the thermal\npower is obtained analytically, and the low-temperature crossover from the\n$T^{3}$ to $T^{3}/(1-\\nu^2)+9\\gamma T^4/[T^*(1-\\nu^2)^{3/2}]$ dependence is\nalso observed. The corresponding quantities are estimated for the material\nparameters from a metallic nanotube.\n", "  We show that parity-time (PT) symmetric Bragg periodic structures, near the\nspontaneous PT - symmetry breaking point, can act as unidirectional invisible\nmedia. In this regime, the re flection from one end is diminished while it is\nenhanced from the other. At the same time the transmission coefficient and\nphase, are indistinguishable from those expected in the absence of a grating.\nThe phenomenon is robust even in the presence of Kerr non-linearities, and it\ncan also effectively suppress optical bistabilities.\n", "  We apply the plaquette renormalization scheme of tensor network states [Phys.\nRev. E, 83, 056703 (2011)] to study the spin-1/2 frustrated Heisenberg J1-J2\nmodel on a L*L square lattice with L = 8, 16 and 32. By treating tensor\nelements as variational parameters, we obtain the ground states for different\nJ2/J1 values, and investigate the staggered magnetic order parameters, the\nnearest-neighbor spin-spin correlations and the plaquette order parameters. In\naddition to the well-known N\\'eel-order and collinear-order at low and high\nJ2/J1, we observe a plaquette order at intermediate J2/J1. A continuous\ntransition between the N\\'eel order and the plaquette order near J2 = 0.40J1 is\nobserved. The collinear order emerges at J2 = 0.62J1 through a first-order\nphase transition.\n", "  We analyze how to exploit Brillouin scattering for the purpose of cooling\nopto-mechanical devices and present a quantum-mechanical theory for Brillouin\ncooling. Our analysis shows that significant cooling ratios can be obtained\nwith standard experimental parameters. A further improvement of cooling\nefficiency is possible by increasing the dissipation of the optical anti-Stokes\nresonance.\n", "  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. Please see [arXiv:1208.3224].\nWe investigate a model where dark energy is caused by the photon field coupling\nto gravitation. The cosmological background expectation value of the\nelectromagnetic scalar potential generates the Planck mass as well as causing\nan exponential expansion which is identified with dark energy. The Higgs-like\nmechanism for the vector potential predicts the photon mass to be exactly zero.\n", "  In this work, we present an implementation of quantum logic gates and\nalgorithms in a three effective qubits system, represented by a (I = 7/2) NMR\nquadrupolar nuclei. To implement these protocols we have used the strong\nmodulating pulses (SMP). The various stages of each implementation were\nverified by quantum state tomography (QST). It is presented here the results\nfor the computational base states, Toffolli logic gates, and Deutsch-Jozsa and\nGrover algorithms. Also, we discuss the difficulties and advantages of\nimplementing such protocols using the SMP technique in quadrupolar systems.\n", "  When an ultra-high energy neutrino or cosmic ray strikes the Lunar surface a\nradio-frequency pulse is emitted. We plan to use the LOFAR radio telescope to\ndetect these pulses. In this work we propose an efficient trigger\nimplementation for LOFAR optimized for the observation of short radio pulses.\n", "  We construct the effective lowest-band Bose-Hubbard model incorporating\ninteraction-induced on-site correlations. The model is based on ladder\noperators for local correlated states, which deviate from the usual Wannier\ncreation and annihilation, allowing for a systematic construction of the most\nappropriate single-band low-energy description in the form of the extended\nBose-Hubbard model. A formulation of this model in terms of ladder operators\nnot only naturally contains the previously found effective multibody\ninteractions, but also contains multibody-induced single-particle tunneling,\npair tunneling, and nearest-neighbor interaction processes of higher orders. An\nalternative description of the same model can be formulated in terms of\noccupation-dependent Bose-Hubbard parameters. These multiparticle effects can\nbe enhanced using Feshbach resonances, leading to corrections which are well\nwithin experimental reach and of significance to the phase diagram of ultracold\nbosonic atoms in an optical lattice. We analyze the energy-reduction mechanism\nof interacting atoms on a local lattice site and show that this cannot be\nexplained only by a spatial broadening of Wannier orbitals on a single-particle\nlevel, which neglects correlations.\n", "  We measure the statistical polarization of quadrupolar nuclear spins in a\nsub-micrometer (0.6 um^3) particle of GaAs using magnetic resonance force\nmicroscopy. The crystalline sample is cut out of a GaAs wafer and attached to a\nmicro-mechanical cantilever force sensor using a focused ion beam technique.\nNuclear magnetic resonance is demonstrated on ensembles containing less than 5\nx 10^8 nuclear spins and occupying a volume of around (300 nm)^3 in GaAs with\nreduced volumes possible in future experiments. We discuss how the further\nreduction of this detection volume will bring the spin ensemble into a regime\nwhere random spin fluctuations, rather than Boltzmann polarization, dominate\nits dynamics. The detection of statistical polarization in GaAs therefore\nrepresents an important first step toward 3D magnetic resonance imaging of\nIII-V materials on the nanometer-scale.\n", "  Context. We present very early optical lightcurves beginning 10 days before\nmaximum of the Type IIn supernova 1998S, covering the first four months after\ndiscovery. Aims. We examine the light evolution and try to compare the\nlightcurves to two analytical models(Nakar & Sari(2010) and Rabinak &\nWaxman(2011)) for a red supergiant star. Methods. The photometry was carried at\nthe 60-cm telescope of the Xinglong Station of China. Broadband filters\nJohnsons B, V and Cousins R were used. Results. The magnitude rose for the\nfirst few days and then dropped slowly afterwards. The two different models we\nuse can fit the early lightcurves very well. The explosion date derived from\nthe models is within the range of 1998 March 1.34 - 2.64(JD 2450873.84 - JD\n2450875.14.) The radius of the progenitor is found to be ~ 300 Rsun and ~ 2000\nRsun for the model of Nakar & Sari(2010) and Rabinak & Waxman(2011)\nrespectively. The constraint on mass and energy is not strong. The ranges of\nthese two parameters are within that of a red supergiant.\n", "  Stabilizing a nulling interferometer at a nanometric level is the key issue\nto obtain deep null depths. The PERSEE breadboard has been designed to study\nand optimize the operation of a cophased nulling bench in the most realistic\ndisturbing environment of a space mission. This presentation focuses on the\ncurrent results of the PERSEE bench. In terms of metrology, we cophased at 0.33\nnm rms for the piston and 80 mas rms for the tip/tilt (0.14% of the Airy disk).\nA Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control coupled with an unsupervised\nvibration identification allows us to maintain that level of correction, even\nwith characteristic vibrations of nulling interferometry space missions. These\nperformances, with an accurate design and alignment of the bench, currently\nlead to a polychromatic unpolarised null depth of 8.9E-6 stabilized at 3E-7 on\nthe [1.65-2.45] \\mum spectral band (37% bandwidth).\n", "  We develop a method to predict the existence of edge states in graphene\nribbons for a large class of boundaries. This approach is based on the\nbulk-edge correspondence between the quantized value of the Zak phase Z(k),\nwhich is a Berry phase across an appropriately chosen one-dimensional Brillouin\nzone, and the existence of a localized state of momentum k at the boundary of\nthe ribbon. This bulk-edge correspondence is rigorously demonstrated for a one\ndimensional toy model as well as for graphene ribbons with zigzag edges. The\nrange of k for which edge states exist in a graphene ribbon is then calculated\nfor arbitrary orientations of the edges. Finally, we show that the introduction\nof an anisotropy leads to a topological transition in terms of the Zak phase,\nwhich modifies the localization properties at the edges. Our approach gives a\nnew geometrical understanding of edge states, it confirms and generalizes the\nresults of several previous works.\n", "  The phonon and thermodynamic properties of rare-earth-aluminum intermetallics\nAlRE (RE=Y, Gd, Pr, Yb) with B2-type structure are investigated by performing\ndensity functional theory and density functional perturbation theory within the\nquasiharmonic approximation. The phonon spectra and phonon density of states,\nincluding the phonon partial density of states and total density of states,\nhave been discussed. Our results demonstrate that the density of states is\nmostly composed of Al states at the high frequency. The temperature dependence\nof various quantities such as the thermal expansions, the heat capacities at\nconstant volume and constant pressure, the isothermal bulk modulus, and the\nentropy are obtained. The electronic contribution to the specific heat is\ndiscussed, and the presented results show that the thermal electronic\nexcitation affecting the thermal properties is inessential.\n", "  Spontaneously crystalline ground states, called quantum crystals, of a\ntrapped Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensate are numerically investigated.\nAs a result described by a mean-field order parameter, such states\nsimultaneously possess crystalline and superfluid properties. A hexagonal\ndroplet lattice is observed in a quasi-two-dimensional system when dressing\ninteraction is sufficiently strong. Onset of these states is characterized by a\ndrastic drop of the non-classical rotational inertia proposed by Leggett [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 25, 1543 (1970)]. In addition, an AB stacking bilayer lattice can\nalso be attained. Due to an anisotropic interaction possibly induced by an\nexternal electric field, transition from a hexagonal to a nearly square droplet\nlattice is also observed.\n", "  The processes leading to nonthermal condensate vaporization and\ncharge-density wave (CDW) melting with femtosecond laser pulses is\nsystematically investigated in different materials. We find that vaporization\nis relatively slow (tau_v ~ 1 ps) and inefficient in superconductors,\nexhibiting a strong systematic dependence of the vaporization energy Uv on Tc.\nIn contrast, melting of CDW order proceeds rapidly (tau_m = 50 ~ 200 fs) and\nmore efficiently. A quantitative model describing the observed systematic\nbehavior in superconductors is proposed based on a phonon-mediated\nquasi-particle (QP) bottleneck mechanism. In contrast, Fermi surface disruption\nby hot QPs is proposed to be responsible for CDW state melting.\n", "  The interacting atom-molecule BEC (AMBEC) dynamics is investigated in the\nmean field ap- proach. The presence of atom-atom, atom-molecule and\nmolecule-molecule interactions, coupled with a characteristically different\ninteraction representing atom-molecule interconversion, endows this system with\nnonlinearities, which differ significantly from the standard Gross-Pitaevskii\n(GP) equation. Exact localized solutions are found to belong to two distinct\nclasses. The first ones are analogous to the soliton solutions of the weakly\ncoupled GP equation, whereas the second non- equivalent class is related to the\nsolitons of the strongly coupled BEC. Distinct parameter domains characterize\nthese solitons, some of which are analogous to the complex profile Bloch\nsolitons in magnetic systems. These localized solutions are found to represent\na variety of phenomena, which include co-existence of both atom-molecule\ncomplex and miscible-immiscible phases. Numerical sta- bility is explicitly\nchecked, as also the stability analysis based on the study of quantum\nuctuations around our solutions. We also find out the domain of modulation\ninstability in this system.\n", "  According to a recent conjecture, isospectral objects have different nodal\ncount sequences. We study generalized Laplacians on discrete graphs, and use\nthem to construct the first non-trivial counter-examples to this conjecture. In\naddition, these examples demonstrate a surprising connection between\nisospectral discrete and quantum graphs.\n", "  Using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we studied the local structure in\nLaMnO3 under applied pressure across and well above the insulator to metal (IM)\ntransition. A hysteretic behavior points to the coexistence of two phases\nwithin a large pressure range (7 to 25 GPa). The ambient phase with highly\nJahn-Teller (JT) distorted MnO6 octahedra is progressively substituted by a new\nphase with less-distorted JT MnO6 units. The electronic delocalization leading\nto the IM transition is finger-printed from the pre-edge XAS structure around\n30 GPa. We observed that the phase transition takes place without any\nsignificant reduction of the JT distortion. This entails band-overlap as the\ndriving mechanism of the IM transition.\n", "  LHC searches for the standard model Higgs Boson in di-photon or di-tau decay\nmodes place strong constraints on the light top-pion state predicted in\ntechnicolor models that include colored technifermions. Compared with the\nstandard Higgs Boson, the top-pions have an enhanced production rate (largely\nbecause the technipion decay constant is smaller than the weak scale) and also\nenhanced branching ratios into di-photon and di-tau final states (largely due\nto the suppression of WW decays of the technipions). These factors combine to\nmake the technipions more visible in both channels than a standard model Higgs\nwould be. Hence, the recent ATLAS and CMS searches for Higgs bosons exclude the\npresence of technipions with masses from 110 GeV to nearly twice the top-quark\nmass in technicolor models that (a) include colored technifermions (b) feature\ntopcolor dynamics and (c) have technicolor groups with three or more\ntechnicolors. For certain models, the limits also apply out to higher\ntechnipion masses or down to the minimum number of technicolors. The limits may\nbe softened somewhat in models where extended technicolor plays a significant\nrole in producing the top quark's mass. Additional LHC data on di-tau and\ndi-photon final states will be extremely valuable in further exploring\ntechnicolor parameter space.\n", "  A cylindrical acrylic tank with inner diameter D = 4 in. is mounted such that\nits axis of symmetry is at some angle measured from the vertical plane. The\nmixing tank is identical to that described in [1] The tank is filled with 200\nmL of 1000 cSt silicone oil and a 5 mL drop of de-ionized water is placed in\nthe oil volume. The water drop is allowed to come to rest and then a motor\nrotates the tank about its axis of symmetry at a fixed frequency = 0.3 Hz.\nTherefore the Reynolds number is fixed at about Re ~ 5 yielding laminar flow\nconditions. A CCD camera (PixeLink) is used to capture video of each\nexperiment.\n", "  We report on a combined theoretical and experimental study of the optical\ncoupling between a microdisk resonator and a waveguide laying on different\nplanes. While the lateral coupling between a planar resonator and a waveguide\nis characterized by a unique distance at which the resonant waveguide\ntransmission vanishes because of destructive interference, the vertical\ncoupling geometry exhibits an oscillatory behavior in the coupling amplitude as\na function of the vertical gap. This effect manifests experimentally as\noscillations in both the waveguide transmission and the mode quality factor. An\nanalytical description based on coupled-mode theory and a two-port\nbeam-splitter model of the waveguide-resonator coupling is developed, which\ncompares successfully both to experimental data and numerical simulations.\n", "  Deposition of graphene on top of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was very\nrecently demonstrated while graphene is now routinely grown on Ni. Because the\nin-plane lattice constants of graphite, h-BN, graphite-like BC2N and of the\nclose-packed surfaces of Co, Ni and Cu match almost perfectly, it should be\npossible to prepare ideal interfaces between these materials which are\nrespectively, a semimetal, insulator, semiconductor, ferromagnetic and\nnonmagnetic metals. Using parameter-free energy minimization and electronic\ntransport calculations, we show how h-BN can be combined with the perfect spin\nfiltering property of Ni|graphite and Co|graphite interfaces to make perfect\ntunnel junctions or ideal spin injectors (SI) with any desired resistance-area\nproduct.\n", "  We present a complete method to characterize multiphoton detectors with a\nsmall overall detection efficiency. We do this by separating the nonlinear\naction of the multiphoton detection event from linear losses in the detector.\nSuch a characterization is a necessary step for quantum information protocols\nwith single and multiphoton detectors and can provide quantitative information\nto understand the underlying physics of a given detector. This characterization\nis applied to a superconducting multiphoton nanodetector, consisting of an NbN\nnanowire with a bowtie-shaped subwavelength constriction. Depending on the bias\ncurrent, this detector has regimes with single and multiphoton sensitivity. We\npresent the first full experimental characterization of such a detector.\n", "  IAU Commission 35 consists of members of the International Astronomical Union\nwhose research is concerned with the structure and evolution of stars in all\nparts of the H-R diagram. Their interests range from various aspects of stellar\ninterior physics, such as convection, diffusion, rotation, magnetic fields, to\nasteroseismology and the prediction of the evolutionary and nucleosynthetic\nhistories of stars that are of vital importance for our understanding of\nstellar populations and galactic chemical evolution. This report presents some\nhighlights that were published during the present triennial term and which\nconcern the field of Stellar Constitution.\n", "  Context. Time dependent gas-grain chemistry can help us understand the\nlayered structure of species deposited onto the surface of grains during the\nlifetime of a protoplanetary disk. The history of trapping important quantities\nof carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules onto the grains is of special\nsignificance for the formation of more complex (organic) molecules on the\nsurface of grains. Aims. Among other processes, cosmic ray-induced UV\nphoto-processes can lead to the efficient formation of OH. Using a more\naccurate treatment of cosmic ray-gas interactions for disks, we obtain an\nincreased cosmic ray-induced UV photon flux of 3.8x10^5 photons cm^-2s^-1 for a\ncosmic-ray ionization rate of H2 value of 5x10^-17 s^-1 (compared to previous\nestimates of 10^4 photons cm^-2s^-1 based on ISM dust properties). We explore\nthe role of the enhanced OH abundance on the gas-grain chemistry in the\nmidplane of the disk at 10 AU, which is a plausible location for comet\nformation. We focus on studying the formation/destruction pathways and\ntimescales of the dominant chemical species. Methods. We solve the chemical\nrate equations based on a gas-grain chemical network and correcting for the\nenhanced cosmic rayinduced UV field. This field is estimated from an\nappropriate treatment of dust properties in a protoplanetary disk, as opposed\nto previous estimates that assume an ISM-like grain size distribution. We also\nexplore the chemical effects of photo-desorption of water ice into OH+H.\nResults. Near the end of the disk's lifetime our chemical model yields H2O, CO,\nCO2 and CH4 ice abundances at 10 AU (consistent with a midplane density of\n10^10 cm^-3 and a temperature of 20 K) that are compatible with measurements of\nthe chemical composition of cometary bodies for a [C/O] ratio of 0.16. Such\ncomparison provides constraints on the physical conditions in which comets were\nformed.\n", "  Convex operational models (COMs) are considered as great extrapolations to\nlarger settings of any statistical theory. In this article we generalize the\nmaximum entropy principle (MaxEnt) of Jaynes' to any COM. After expressing\nMax-Ent in a geometrical and latttice theoretical setting, we are able to cast\nit for any COM. This scope-amplification opens the door to a new\nsystematization of the principle and sheds light into its geometrical\nstructure.\n", "  In recent works, it has been shown rather generally that the time-reversed\nprocess of lasing at threshold realizes a coherent perfect absorber (CPA). In a\nCPA, a lossy medium in an optical cavity with a specific degree of dissipation,\nequal in modulus to the gain of the lasing medium, can perfectly absorb\ncoherent optical waves that are the time-reversed counterpart of the lasing\nfield. Here the time-reversed process of lasing is considered in details for a\nhomogeneously-broadened two-level medium in an optical cavity, and the\nconditions for CPA are derived. It is shown that, owing to the dispersive\nproperties of the two-level medium, exact time-reversal symmetry is broken and\nthe frequency of the field at which CPA occurs is generally different than the\none of the lasing mode. Moreover, at a large cooperation parameter the\nobservation of CPA in the presence of bistability requires to operate in the\nupper branch of the hysteresis cycle.\n", "  In recent works, the idea of time-reversed laser oscillation has been\nproposed and demonstrated to realize a two-channel coherent perfect absorber\n[Y.D. Chong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 053901 (2010); W.Wan et al., Science\n331, 889 (2011)]. Here the time reversal of optical parametric oscillation in a\nnonlinear ?(2) medium is considered and shown to realize a coherent perfect\nabsorber for colored incident signal and idler fields. A detailed analysis is\npresented for the time-reversed process of mirrorless optical parametric\noscillation in the full nonlinear regime\n", "  We present the first observations of the Sun with the Allen Telescope Array\n(ATA). We used up to six frequencies, from 1.43 to 6 GHz, and baselines from 6\nto 300 m. To our knowledge, these are the first simultaneous multifrequency\nfull-Sun maps obtained at microwave frequencies without mosaicing. The\nobservations took place when the Sun was relatively quiet, although at least\none active region was present each time. We present multi-frequency flux\nbudgets for each sources on the Sun. Outside of active regions, assuming\noptically thin bremsstrahlung (free--free) coronal emission on top of an\noptically thick ~10 000 K chromosphere, the multi-frequency information can be\ncondensed into a single, frequency-independent, \"coronal bremsstrahlung\ncontribution function\" [EM/sqrt(T)] map. This technique allows the separation\nof the physics of emission as well as a measurement of the density structure of\nthe corona. Deviations from this simple relationship usually indicate the\npresence of an additional gyroresonance-emission component, as is typical in\nactive regions.\n", "  Using RHESSI data, we have analyzed some 172 hard X-ray peaks during 53 solar\nflares which exhibited a double-footpoint structure. Fitting both footpoints\nwith power-laws, we find that spectral index differences range mostly between 0\nto 0.6, and only rarely go beyond. Asymmetries between footpoints were not\nobserved to be significantly dependent on their mean heliographic position,\ntheir relative position with respect to each other, nor their orientation with\nrespect to the solar equator. Assuming a symmetric acceleration process, it is\nalso clear that differences in footpoint spectral indices and footpoint flux\nratios can seldom be attributed to a difference in column densities between the\ntwo legs of a coronal loop. Our results corroborate better the magnetic mirror\ntrap scenario. Moreover, footpoint asymmetries are more marked during times of\npeak HXR flux than when averaging over the whole HXR burst, suggesting that the\nmagnetic configuration evolves during individual HXR bursts. We observed also a\nlinear correlation between the peak 50-keV flux and the peak GOES 1-8A channel\nflux, and that HXR burst duration seem correlated with loop length.\n", "  The measurement of the muon inclusive differential cross section dsigma/dpT\nin pp collisions at sqrt(s)=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector is presented. The\nanalysis is performed in the pseudorapidity interval |eta|< 2.5 for muon of\ntransverse momentum 4 < pT < 100 GeV and with an integrated luminosity of 1.4\npb-1. The result is compared with the next-to-leading order with\nnext-to-leading log high pT resummation prediction for the heavy avour\nproduction and with MC@NLO prediction for W-Z bosons production. The\nmeasurement is sensitive for the first time to the next-to-leading log\ncontribution to the heavy flavour production in hadronic interactions.\n", "  A diagonal Bianchi Type III space-time is treated, both at the classical and\nquantum level, in the context of Horava - Lifshitz gravity. The system of the\nclassical equations of motion is reduced to one independent Abel's equation of\nthe first kind. Closed form solution are presented for various values of the\ncoupling constants appearing in the action. Due to the method used, solutions\nof Euclidean, Lorentzian and neutral signature are attained. The solutions\ncorresponding to \\lamda <> 1 are seen to develop curvature singularities as the\nother constants approach their Einsteinian values, in contrast to those with\n\\lamda = 1 which tend to the known Einstein gravity solutions. At the quantum\nlevel, the resulting Wheeler-DeWitt equation is explicitly solved for \\lamda =\n1, \\sigma = 0 and \\lamda = 1/3 . The ensuing wave-functions diverge in the\nEinsteinian limit.\n", "  We consider a single electron traveling along a strictly one-dimensional\nquantum wire interacting with another electron in a quantum ring capacitively\ncoupled to the wire. We develop an exact numerical method for treating the\nscattering problem within the stationary two-electron wave function picture.\nThe considered process conserves the total energy but the electron within the\nwire passes a part of its energy to the ring. We demonstrate that the inelastic\nscattering results in both magnetic asymmetry of the transfer probability and a\nturnstile action of the ring on the electrons traveling separately along the\nring. We demonstrate that the inelastic backscattering and / or inelastic\nelectron transfer can be selectively eliminated from the process by inclusion\nof an energy filter into the wire in form of a double barrier system with the\nresonant energy level tuned to the energy of the incident electron. We\ndemonstrate that the magnetic symmetry is restored when the inelastic\nbackscattering is switched o?, and the turnstile character of the ring is\nremoved when the energy transfer to the ring is excluded for both transferred\nand backscattered electron waves. We discuss the relation of the present\nresults to the conductance systems based on the electron gas.\n", "  The angular momentum of a star is an important astrophysical quantity related\nto its internal structure, formation and evolution. On average, helioseismology\nyields S = 1.92 10^41 kg m^2 s^-1 for the angular momentum of the Sun. We show\nhow it should be possible to measure or, at least, constrain it in a near\nfuture by using the gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring effect predicted by general\nrelativity for the orbit of a test particle moving around a central rotating\nbody. We also discuss the present-day situation in view of the latest\ndeterminations of the supplementary perihelion precession of Mercury.\n", "  Quantum trajectories are used to study OPERA findings regarding superluminal\nneutrinos. As the applicable stationary quantum Klein-Gordon equation is real,\nreal quantum reduced actions and subsequent real quantum trajectories follow.\nThe requirements for superluminal neutrinos are examined. A neutrino that is\nself-entangled by its own backscatter is shown to have a nonlocal quantum\ntrajectory that may generate a superluminal transit time. Various cases are\nshown to produce theoretical superluminal neutrinos consistent with OPERA\nneutrinos. Quantum trajectories are also shown to provide insight into neutrino\noscillations.\n", "  Recent work by Teifel and Mahler [Eur. Phys. J. B 75, 275 (2010)] raises\nlegitimate concerns regarding the validity of quantum nonequilibrium work\nrelations in processes involving moving hard walls. We study this issue in the\ncontext of the rapidly expanding one-dimensional quantum piston. Utilizing\nexact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\u007fodinger equation, we find that the\nevolution of the wave function can be decomposed into static and dynamic\ncomponents, which have simple semiclassical interpretations in terms of\nparticle-piston collisions. We show that nonequilibrium work relations remains\nvalid at any finite piston speed, provided both components are included, and we\nstudy explicitly the work distribution for this model system.\n", "  We present enhancements to the computational efficiency of exact exchange\ncalculations using the density matrix and local support functions. We introduce\na numerical method which avoids the explicit calculation the four-center\ntwo-electron repulsion integrals and reduces the prefactor scaling by a factor\nN, where N is the number of atoms within the range of the exact exchange\nHamiltonian. This approach is based on a contraction-reduction scheme, and\ntakes advantage of the discretization space which enables the direct summation\nover the support functions in a localized space. Using the sparsity property of\nthe density matrix, the scaling of the prefactor can be further reduced to\nreach asymptotically O(N).\n", "  We present the prospects for the discovery or exclusion of heavy vector-like\ncharge 2/3 quarks, T, in proton-proton collisions at two center-of-mass\nenergies, 14 and 33 TeV at the LHC. In this note, the pair production of T\nquark and its antiparticle, with decays to W boson and a b quark (Wb), a top\nquark and the Higgs boson (tH), and a top quark and Z boson (tZ) are\ninvestigated. Higgs boson decays to $b\\bar b$ and $W^+W^-$ final states are\nselected for this study.\n", "  Microscopic mechanism for the Rashba-type band splitting is examined in\ndetail. We show how asymmetric charge distribution is formed when local orbital\nangular momentum (OAM) and crystal momentum get interlocked due to surface\neffects. An electrostatic energy term in the Hamiltonian appears when such OAM\nand crystal momentum dependent asymmetric charge distribution is placed in an\nelectric field produced from an inversion symmetry breaking (ISB). Analysis by\nusing an effective Hamiltonian shows that, as the atomic spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) strength increases from weak to strong, originally OAM-quenched states\nevolve into well-defined chiral OAM states and then to total angular momentum\nJ-states. In addition, the energy scale of the band splitting changes from\natomic SOC energy to electrostatic energy. To confirm the validity of the\nmodel, we study OAM and spin structures of Au(111) system by using an effective\nHamiltonian for the d-orbitals case. As for strong SOC regime, we choose\nBi2Te2Se as a prototype system. We performed circular dichroism angle resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy experiments as well as first-principles\ncalculations. We find that the effective model can explain various aspects of\nspin and OAM structures of the system.\n", "  We discuss the conditions under which a body, moving non-inertially in\nMinkowski space, can preserve its size. Under these conditions, using a series\nexpansion of the generalized Lorentz transformation, we find a coor- dinate\ntransformation connecting the laboratory inertial reference frame S and the\nrigid non-inertial reference frame s which moves without its own rotation with\nrespect to S. Direct consequences of this transformation are: (a)\ndesynchronization, in system s, of the coordinate clocks of s which were\npreviously synchronized in S, and (b) a kinematic contraction of a ruler of\nsystem s observed in S. We also consider the dependence of the transfor- mation\nvector parameter on the proper coordinates of s.\n", "  We study the formation of Majorana fermions in honeycomb-lattice structures\nin the presence of a Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit coupling, and in the\nproximity of an s-wave superconductor. We show that an exact mapping exists\nbetween an anisotropic hexagonal-lattice nanoribbon at k = 0 and a\none-dimensional chain, for which the existence of Majorana fermions has been\nextensively discussed. Consequently we can predict the conditions for the\nemergence of Majorana fermions at the edges of such ribbon, and relate the\nexistence of Majoranas to a band inversion in the bulk band structure. Moreover\nwe find that similar situations arise in isotropic lattices and we give some\nexamples which show the formation of Majorana fermions in these structures.\n", "  The energy gap for electronic excitations is one of the most important\ncharacteristics of the superconducting state, as it directly refects the\npairing of electrons. In the copper-oxide high temperature superconductors\n(HTSCs), a strongly anisotropic energy gap, which vanishes along high symmetry\ndirections, is a clear manifestation of the d-wave symmetry of the pairing.\nThere is, however, a dramatic change in the form of the gap anisotropy with\nreduced carrier concentration (underdoping). Although the vanishing of the gap\nalong the diagonal to the square Cu-O bond directions is robust, the doping\ndependence of the large gap along the Cu-O directions suggests that its origin\nmight be different from pairing. It is thus tempting to associate the large gap\nwith a second order parameter distinct from superconductivity. We use\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to show that the two-gap\nbehavior, and the destruction of well defined electronic excitations, are not\nuniversal features of HTSCs, and depend sensitively on how the underdoped\nmaterials are prepared. Depending on cation substitution, underdoped samples\neither show two-gap behavior or not. In contrast, many other characteristics of\nHTSCs, such as the domelike dependence of Tc on doping, long-lived excitations\nalong the diagonals to the Cu-O bonds, energy gap at the antinode (crossing of\nthe underlying Fermi surface and the (pi, 0)-(pi, pi) line) decreasing\nmonotonically with doping, while persisting above Tc (the pseudogap), are\npresent in all samples, irrespective of whether they exhibit two-gap behavior\nor not. Our results imply that universal aspects of high Tc superconductivity\nare relatively insensitive to differences in the electronic states along the\nCu-O bond directions.\n", "  Spin torque nano oscillators (STNO) are nano-scale devices that can convert a\ndirect current into short wave-length spin-wave excitations in a ferromagnetic\nlayer. We show that arrays of STNO can be used to create directional spin-wave\nradiation similar to electromagnetic antennas. Combining STNO excitations with\nplanar spin waves also creates interference patterns. We show that these\ninterference patterns are static and have information on the wavelength and\nphase of the spin waves emitted from the STNO.We describe means of actively\ncontrolling spin-wave radiation patterns with the direct current owing through\nSTNO, which is useful in on-chip communication and information processing and\ncould be a promising technique for studying short wave-length spin waves in\ndifferent materials.\n", "  A recursive method for construction of symmetric irreducible representations\nof O(2l+1) in the O(2l + 1) supset O(3) basis for identical boson systems is\nproposed. The formalism is realized based on the group chain U(2l + 1) supset\nU(2l- 1) x U(2), of which the symmetric irreducible representations are simply\nreducible. The basis vectors of the O(2l+1) supset O(2l-1) x U(1) can easily be\nconstructed from those of U(2l + 1) supset U(2l-1) x U(2) supset O(2l-1) x U(1)\nwith no boson pairs, from which one can construct symmetric irreducible\nrepresentations of O(2l+1) in the O(2l-1) x U(1) basis when all symmetric\nirreducible representations of O(2l-1) are known. As a starting point, basis\nvectors of symmetric irreducible representations of O(5) are constructed in the\nO1(3) x U(1) basis. Matrix representations of O(5) supset O1(3) x U(1),\ntogether with the elementary Wigner coefficients, are presented. After the\nangular momentum projection, a three-term relation in determining the expansion\ncoefficients of the O(5) supset O(3) basis vectors in terms of those of the\nO1(3) x U(1) is derived. The eigenvectors of the projection matrix with zero\neigenvalues constructed according to the three-term relation completely\ndetermine the basis vectors of O(5) supset O(3). Formulae for evaluating the\nelementary Wigner coefficients of O(5) supset O(3) are derived explicitly.\nAnalytical expressions of some elementary Wigner coefficients of O(5) supset\nO(3) for the coupling (tau, 0) x (1,0) with resultant angular momentum quantum\nnumber L = 2 tau+ 2 - k for k = 0, 2, 3,...,6 with a multiplicity 2 case for k\n= 6 are presented.\n", "  We report photometric observations for comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) obtained during\nthe time period immediately after discovery (r=6.28 AU) until it moved into\nsolar conjunction in mid-2013 June using the UH2.2m, and Gemini North 8-m\ntelescopes on Mauna Kea, the Lowell 1.8m in Flagstaff, the Calar Alto 1.2m\ntelescope in Spain, the VYSOS-5 telescopes on Mauna Loa Hawaii and data from\nthe CARA network. Additional pre-discovery data from the Pan STARRS1 survey\nextends the light curve back to 2011 September 30 (r=9.4 AU). The images showed\na similar tail morphology due to small micron sized particles throughout 2013.\nObservations at sub-mm wavelengths using the JCMT on 15 nights between 2013\nMarch 9 (r=4.52 AU) and June 16 (r=3.35 AU) were used to search for CO and HCN\nrotation lines. No gas was detected, with upper limits for CO ranging between\n(3.5-4.5)E27 molec/s. Combined with published water production rate estimates\nwe have generated ice sublimation models consistent with the photometric light\ncurve. The inbound light curve is likely controlled by sublimation of CO2. At\nthese distances water is not a strong contributor to the outgassing. We also\ninfer that there was a long slow outburst of activity beginning in late 2011\npeaking in mid-2013 January (r~5 AU) at which point the activity decreased\nagain through 2013 June. We suggest that this outburst was driven by CO\ninjecting large water ice grains into the coma. Observations as the comet came\nout of solar conjunction seem to confirm our models.\n", "  This is an example of application of Ziglin-Morales-Ramis algebraic studies\nin Hamiltonian integrability, more specifically the result by Morales, Ramis\nand Sim\\'o on higher-order variational equations, to the well-known\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological model. A previous paper by the author\nformalises said variational systems in such a way allowing the simple\nexpression of notable elements of the differential Galois group needed to study\nintegrability. Using this formalisation and an alternative method already used\nby other authors, we find sufficient conditions whose fulfillment would entail\nvery simple proofs of non-integrability -- both for the complete Hamiltonian, a\ngoal already achieved by other means by Coelho et al, and for a special open\ncase attracting recent attention.\n", "  The influence of the electron-vibron coupling on the transport properties of\na strongly interacting quantum dot built in a suspended carbon nanotube is\nanalyzed. The latter is probed by a charged AFM tip scanned along the axis of\nthe CNT which induces oscillations of the chemical potential and of the linear\nconductance. These oscillations are due to the competition between finite-size\neffects and the formation of a Wigner molecule for strong interactions. Such\noscillations are shown to be suppressed by the electron-vibron coupling. The\nsuppression is more pronounced in the regime of weak Coulomb interactions,\nwhich ensures that probing Wigner correlations in such a system is in principle\npossible.\n", "  We use group or representation theory and scattering matrix calculations to\nderive analytical results for the band structure topology and the scattering\nparameters, applicable to any chiral photonic crystal with body-centered cubic\nsymmetry I432 for circularly-polarised incident light. We demonstrate in\nparticular that all bands along the cubic [100] direction can be identified\nwith the irreducible representations E+/-,A and B of the C4 point group. E+ and\nE- modes represent the only transmission channels for plane waves with wave\nvector along the ? line, and can be identified as non-interacting transmission\nchannels for right- (E-) and left-circularly polarised light (E+),\nrespectively. Scattering matrix calculations provide explicit relationships for\nthe transmission and reflectance amplitudes through a finite slab which\nguarantee equal transmission rates for both polarisations and vanishing\nellipticity below a critical frequency, yet allowing for finite rotation of the\npolarisation plane. All results are verified numerically for the so-called\n8-srs geometry, consisting of eight interwoven equal-handed dielectric Gyroid\nnetworks embedded in air. The combination of vanishing losses, vanishing\nellipticity, near-perfect transmission and optical activity comparable to that\nof metallic meta-materials makes this geometry an attractive design for\nnanofabricated photonic materials.\n", "  The phenomenon of Anderson localization of waves in elastic systems is\nstudied. We analyze this phenomenon in two different set of systems: disordered\nlinear chains of harmonic oscillators and disordered rods which oscillate with\ntorsional waves. The first set is analyzed numerically whereas the second one\nis studied both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, we discuss the\nlocalization properties of the waves as a function of the frequency. In doing\nthat we have used the inverse participation ratio, which is related to the\nlocalization length. We find that the normal modes localize exponentially\naccording to Anderson theory. In the elastic systems, the localization length\ndecreases with frequency. This behavior is in contrast with what happens in\nanalogous quantum mechanical systems, for which the localization length grows\nwith energy. This difference is explained by means of the properties of the re\nection coefficient of a single scatterer in each case.\n", "  The Massive Young star-forming complex Study in Infrared and X-ray (MYStIX)\nuses data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory to identify and characterize the\nyoung stellar populations in twenty Galactic (d < 4 kpc) massive star-forming\nregions. Here, the X-ray analysis for Chandra ACIS-I observations of ten of the\nMYStIX fields is described, and a catalog of >10,000 X-ray sources is\npresented. In comparison to other published Chandra source lists for the same\nregions, the number of MYStIX detected faint X-ray sources in a region is often\ndoubled. While the higher catalog sensitivity increases the chance of false\ndetections, it also increases the number of matches to infrared stars. X-ray\nemitting contaminants include foreground stars, background stars, and\nextragalactic sources. The X-ray properties of sources in these classes are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Spitzer IRAC observations and stellar photometric catalogs are presented for\nthe Massive Young Star-Forming Complex Study in the Infrared and X-ray\n(MYStIX). MYStIX is a multiwavelength census of young stellar members of twenty\nnearby (d < 4 kpc), Galactic, star-forming regions that contain at least one O\nstar. All regions have data available from the Spitzer Space Telescope,\nconsisting of GLIMPSE or other published catalogs for eleven regions and\nresults of our own photometric analysis of archival data for the remaining nine\nregions. This paper seeks to construct deep and reliable catalogs of sources\nfrom the Spitzer images. Mid-infrared study of these regions faces challenges\nof crowding and high nebulosity. Our new catalogs typically contain fainter\nsources than existing Spitzer studies, which improves the match rate to Chandra\nX-ray sources that are likely to be young stars, but increases the possibility\nof spurious point-source detections, especially peaks in the nebulosity. IRAC\ncolor-color diagrams help distinguish spurious detections of nebular PAH\nemission from the infrared excess associated with dusty disks around young\nstars. The distributions of sources on the mid-infrared color-magnitude and\ncolor-color diagrams reflect differences between MYStIX regions, including\nastrophysical effects such as stellar ages and disk evolution.\n", "  We adapted the highly successful scattering density profile (SDP) model,\nwhich is used to jointly analyze small angle x-ray and neutron scattering data\nfrom unilamellar vesicles, for use with data from fully hydrated, liquid\ncrystalline multilamellar vesicles (MLVs). By using a genetic algorithm, this\nnew method is capable of providing high resolution structural information, as\nwell as determining bilayer elastic bending fluctuations from standalone x-ray\ndata. Important structural parameters, such as bilayer thickness and area per\nlipid were determined for a series of saturated and unsaturated lipids, as well\nas binary mixtures with cholesterol. Results are in good agreement with\npreviously reported SDP data, which used both neutron and x-ray data. The\naddition of deuterated and non-deuterated MLV neutron data to the analysis\nimproved lipid backbone information, but did not improve, within experimental\nuncertainties, the structural information regarding bilayer thickness and area\nper lipid.\n", "  Quantum mechanical treatment of light inside dielectric media is important to\nunderstand the behavior of an optical system. In this paper, a two-level atom\nembedded in a rectangular waveguide surrounded by a perfect electric conductor\nis considered. Spontaneous emission, propagation, and detection of a photon are\ndescribed by the second quantization formalism. The quantized modes for light\nare divided into two types: photonic propagating modes and localized modes with\nexponential decay along the direction of waveguide. Though spontaneous emission\ndepends on all possible modes including the localized modes, detection far from\nthe source only depends on the propagating modes. This discrepancy of dynamical\nbehaviors gives two different decay rates along space and time in the\ncorrelation function of the photon detection.\n", "  We consider the nonlinear propagation of finite amplitude electron-acoustic\nwaves (EAWs) in multi-component plasmas composed of two distinct groups of\nelectrons (cold and hot components), and non-isothermal ions. We use the\ncontinuity and momentum equations for cold inertial electrons, Boltzmann law\nfor inertialess hot electrons, non-isothermal density distribution for hot\nions, and Poisson's equation to derive an energy integral with a modified\nSagdeev potential (MSP) for nonlinear EAWs. The MSP is analyzed to demonstrate\nthe existence of arbitrary amplitude EA solitary pulses (EASPs) and EA double\nlayers (EA-DLs). Small amplitude limits have also been considered and\nanalytical results for EASPs and EA-DLs are presented. The implication of our\nresults to space and laboratory plasmas is briely discussed.\n", "  We apply constructions from topos-theoretic approaches to quantum theory to\nalgebraic quantum field theory. Thus a net of operator algebras is reformulated\nas a functor that maps regions of spacetime into a category of ringed topoi. We\nask whether this functor is a sheaf, a question which is related to the net\nsatisfying certain kinematical independence conditions. In addition, we\nconsider a C*-algebraic version of Nuiten's recent sheaf condition, and\ndemonstrate how it relates to C*-independence of the underlying net of operator\nalgebras.\n", "  Repetitive wet thermal oxidations of a tapered oxide aperture in a\nmicropillar structure are demonstrated. After each oxidation step the confined\noptical modes are analyzed at room temperature. Three regimes are identified.\nFirst, the optical confinement increases when the aperture oxidizes towards the\ncenter. Then, the cavity modes shift by more than 30 nm, when the taper starts\nto oxidize through the center, leading to a decrease in the optical path\nlength. Finally, the resonance frequency levels o?f, when the aperture is\noxidized all the way through the micropillar, but confined optical modes with a\nhigh quality factor remain. This repetitive oxidation technique therefore\nenables precise control of the optical cavity volume or wavelength.\n", "  This paper presents the set of measurements of ultra-high energy air shower\nradio emission at frequency 32 MHz in period of 2008-2012. The showers are\nselected by geomagnetic and azimuth angles and then by the energy in three\nintervals: 3*10^16 3*10^17 eV, 3*10^17 6*10^17 eV and 6*10^17 5*10^18 eV. In\neach energy interval average lateral distribution function using mathematically\naveraged data from antennas with different directions are plotted. In the\npaper, using experimental data the dependence of radio signal averaged\namplitude from geomagnetic angle, the shower axis distance and the energy are\ndetermined. Depth of maximum of cosmic ray showers Xmax for the given energy\nrange is evaluated. The evaluation is made according QGSJET model calculations\nand average lateral distribution function shape.\n", "  The analysis and interpretation of the present and future neutrino\noscillation experiments strongly rely on the quantitative understanding of\nneutrino and antineutrino interactions with nuclei in the \"few GeV\" energy\nrange. With the advent of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC)\nexperimental techniques for neutrino detection, a novel approach and\nmethodology in neutrino data analysis is now being developed. Purpose of this\nWhite Paper is to briefly illustrate this method, as based on real events\ncategorization into experimental exclusive topologies, rather than on MC driven\nclassification of the event rates in terms of interaction channel. Data\ncollected by the ArgoNeuT experiment in the \"few-GeV\" energy range are\nextremely helpful to directly probe features of neutrino interactions and\nassociated nuclear effects in the range of interest for future long-baseline\nneutrino oscillation experiments.\n", "  LiFeAs is unique among the arsenic based Fe-pnictide superconductors because\nit is the only nearly stoichiometric compound which does not exhibit magnetic\norder. This is at odds with electronic structure calculations which and a very\nstable magnetic state and predict cylindrical hole- and electron-like Fermi\nsurface sheets whose geometry suggests spin uctuations and a possible\ninstability toward long-range ordering at the nesting vector. In fact, a\ncomplex magnetic phase-diagram is indeed observed in the isostructural NaFeAs\ncompound. Previous angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments revealed\nthe existence of both hole and electron-like surfaces, but with rather distinct\ncross-sectional areas and an absence of the nesting that is thought to underpin\nboth magnetic order and superconductivity in the pnictide family of\nsuperconductors. These ARPES observations were challenged by subsequent de Haas\nvan Alphen (dHvA) measurements which detected a few, electron like Fermi\nsurface sheets in rough agreement with the original band calculations. Here, we\nshow a detailed dHvA study unveiling additional, small and nearly isotropic\nFermi surface sheets in LiFeAs single crystals, which ought to correspond to\nhole-like orbits, as previously observed by ARPES. Therefore, our results\nconciliate the apparent discrepancy between ARPES and the previous dHvA\nresults5. The small size of these Fermi surface pockets suggests a prominent\nrole for the electronic correlations in LiFeAs. The absence of gap nodes, in\ncombination with the coexistence of quasi-two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nFermi surfaces, favor a s-wave pairing symmetry for LiFeAs. But similar\nelectron-like Fermi surfaces combined with very different hole pockets between\nLiFeAs and LiFeP, suggest that the nodes in the gap function of LiFeP might be\nlocated on the hole-pockets.\n", "  The magnetic moment per Co4+ of P2(gamma)-type NaxCoO2 in Curie-Weiss metal\nregime is revisited and examined under a newly proposed modification of the\noctahedral crystal electric field (CEF). The proposed model explains the origin\nof the existence of the intermediate state S=1 for Co3+ through an exciton-like\nelementary excitation of the narrow gap between the split eg and t2g groups.\nThe CoO2 layer is proposed to be constructed from the tilted edge-sharing\nsquare-planar CoO2 chains with inter-chain coupling. The square-planar CEF of\nCoO2 requires covalent bond formation between Co and the four in-plane\nneighboring oxygens, while the oxygens sitting in the neighboring chains can be\nviewed as apical oxygens of low effective charge for a CoO6 pseudo-octahedron.\nThe reason why angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) failed to\nobserve the local-density approximation (LDA) predicted e'g hole pockets at\nkz=0 and the reversed order of the t2g splittings between LDA and CEF\ncalculations can also be resolved using the proposed model.\n", "  Context. The international whole earth blazar telescope (WEBT) consortium\nplanned and carried out three days of intensive micro-variability observations\nof S5 0716+714 from February 22, 2009 to February 25, 2009. This object was\nchosen due to its bright apparent magnitude range, its high declination, and\nits very large duty cycle for micro-variations. Aims. We report here on the\nlong continuous optical micro-variability light curve of 0716+714 obtained\nduring the multi-site observing campaign during which the Blazar showed almost\nconstant variability over a 0.5 magnitude range. The resulting light curve is\npresented here for the first time. Observations from participating\nobservatories were corrected for instrumental differences and combined to\nconstruct the overall smoothed light curve. Methods. Thirty-six observatories\nin sixteen countries participated in this continuous monitoring program and\ntwenty of them submitted data for compilation into a continuous light curve.\nThe light curve was analyzed using several techniques including Fourier\ntransform, Wavelet and noise analysis techniques. Those results led us to model\nthe light curve by attributing the variations to a series of synchrotron\npulses. Results. We have interpreted the observed microvariations in this\nextended light curve in terms of a new model consisting of individual\nstochastic pulses due to cells in a turbulent jet which are energized by a\npassing shock and cool by means of synchrotron emission. We obtained an\nexcellent fit to the 72-hour light curve with the synchrotron pulse model.\n", "  We have studied the exact solution of the extended cluster compass ladder,\nwhich is equivalent to extended quantum compass model with cluster interaction\nbetween next-nearest-neighbor spins, by using the Jordan-Wigner transformation.\nWe show that this model is always gapfull except at the critical surfaces where\nthe energy gap disappears. We obtain the analytic expressions of all critical\ncouplings which drive quantum phase transitions. This model shows a rich phase\ndiagram which includes spin-flop, strip antiferromagnetic and topological\nordered on the legs, in addition to the phase with antiparallel ordering of\nspin y component on the rungs. We study also the universality and scaling\nproperties of the three point correlation functions derivatives in different\nregions to confirm the results obtained using the energy gap analysis. On the\nother hand, we have replaced the cluster interaction with usual form and using\nthe Lanczos method a numerical experiment is done. Analyzing the numerical\nresults, we show that the effect of the cluster interaction between\nnext-nearest-neighbor spins is completely different from the usual form.\n", "  The standard model of strong laser physics, the recollision scenario, omits\nthe ionic core potential after tunneling. Strikingly, although the Coulomb\ninteraction drives all stages of recollision, the maximum energy the electrons\nbring back to the core is found by ignoring it. We resolve this long-standing\nparadox by showing that this good agreement stems from a fortuitous\ncancellation at high intensities. Instead of the three step model, we find that\nthe Coulomb interaction can be fully integrated into a purely classical\nscenario that explains recollisions without invoking tunneling.\n", "  In high-intensity (> 10^21W/cm^2) laser-matter interactions gamma-ray photon\nemission by the electrons can strongly affect the electron's dynamics and\ncopious numbers of electron-positron pairs can be produced by the emitted\nphotons. We show how these processes can be included in simulations by coupling\na Monte-Carlo algorithm describing the emission to a particle-in-cell code. The\nMonte-Carlo algorithm includes quantum corrections to the photon emission,\nwhich we show must be included if the pair production rate is to be correctly\ndetermined. The accuracy, convergence and energy conservation properties of the\nMonte-Carlo algorithm are analysed in simple test problems.\n", "  In-gas-cell laser ionization spectroscopy studies on the neutron deficient\n97-101Ag isotopes have been performed with the LISOL setup. Magnetic dipole\nmoments and mean-square charge radii have been determined for the first time\nwith the exception of 101Ag, which was found in good agreement with previous\nexperimental values. The reported results allow tentatively assigning the spin\nof 97,99Ag to 9/2 and confirming the presence of an isomeric state in these two\nisotopes, whose collapsed hyperfine structure suggests a spin of 1/2 . The\neffect of the N=50 shell closure is not only manifested in the magnetic moments\nbut also in the evolution of the mean-square charge radii of the isotopes\ninvestigated, in accordance with the spherical droplet model predictions.\n", "  We introduce a scheme for perfect routing of quantum states and entanglement\nin regular cavity QED networks. The couplings between the cavities are\nquasi-uniform and each cavity is doped with a two-level atom. Quasi-uniform\ncouplings leads the system to evolve in invariant subspaces. Combination the\nevolutions of the system in its invariant subspaces with quite simple local\noperations on atoms in the networks, gives the perfect routing of quantum\nstates and entanglement through the network. To provide the protocol be robust\ndue to decoherence arisen from photon loss, the field mode of the cavities are\nonly virtually excited.\n", "  Acoustic invisibility of a cloaking system in turbulent uids has been poorly\nunderstood. Here we show that evident scattering would appear in turbulent\nwakes owing to the submergence of a classical cloaking device. The inherent\nmechanism is explained using our theoretical model, which eventually inspires\nus to develop an optimized cloaking approach. Both the near- and far-field\nscatted fields are examined using high order computational acoustic methods.\nThe remarkably low scattering demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed\nacoustic cloaking approach for turbulent uid cases.\n", "  Proof of transverse-momentum-dependent(TMD) factorization for hadron-hadron\ncollision is given in this paper. We focus on processes without detected soft\nfinal hadrons or detected final hadrons that are collinear to initial hadrons.\nThis contradicts the widely accepted viewpoint that TMD- factorization does not\nhold in such processes even in the generalized sense. The key point is that\nsingular points of the type l+ = 0 can be absorbed into Wilson lines of soft\ngluons, where l is collinear to the plus direction. Thus one should subtract\nsuch singular points from the collinear region of l. After such subtraction,\none can make use of Ward identity to absorb effects of scalar-polarized\ncollinear gluons into Wilson lines.\n", "  Systems of identical particles with equal charge are studied under a special\ntype of confinement. These classical particles are free to move inside some\nconvex region S and on the boundary of it $\\Omega$ (the $S^{d-1}-$ sphere, in\nour case). We shall show how particles arrange themselves under the sole action\nof the Coulomb repulsion in many dimensions in the usual Euclidean space,\ntherefore generalizing the so called Thomson problem to many dimensions. Also,\nwe explore how the problem varies when non-Euclidean geometries are considered.\nWe shall see that optimal configurations in all cases possess a high degree of\nsymmetry, regardless of the concomitant dimension or geometry.\n", "  A systematic Bayesian framework is developed for physics constrained\nparameter inference ofstochastic differential equations (SDE) from partial\nobservations. The physical constraints arederived for stochastic climate models\nbut are applicable for many fluid systems. A condition isderived for global\nstability of stochastic climate models based on energy conservation.\nStochasticclimate models are globally stable when a quadratic form, which is\nrelated to the cubic nonlinearoperator, is negative definite. A new algorithm\nfor the efficient sampling of such negative definite matrices is developed and\nalso for imputing unobserved data which improve the accuracy of theparameter\nestimates. The performance of this framework is evaluated on two conceptual\nclimatemodels.\n", "  Based on the Landauer formalism, we demonstrate that the thermal conductance\ndue to the propagation of surface phonon-polaritons along a polar nanowire is\nindependent of the material characteristics and is given by Pi^2kB^2T/3h. The\ngiant propagation length of these energy carriers establishes that this\nquantization holds not only for a temperature much smaller than 1 K, as is the\ncase of electrons and phonons, but also for temperatures comparable to room\ntemperature, which can significantly facilitate its observation and application\nin the thermal management of nanoscale electronics and photonics.\n", "  We present preliminary results of a 3D MHD simulation of the convective\nenvelope of the giant star Pollux for which the rotation period and the\nmagnetic field intensity have been measured from spectroscopic and\nspectropolarimetric observations. This giant is one of the first single giants\nwith a detected magnetic field, and the one with the weakest field so far. Our\naim is to understand the development and the action of the dynamo in its\nextended convective envelope.\n", "  MCgrid is a software package that provides access to the APPLgrid\ninterpolation tool for Monte Carlo event generator codes, allowing for fast and\nflexible variations of scales, coupling parameters and PDFs in cutting edge\nleading and next-to-leading-order QCD calculations. This is achieved by\nproviding additional tools to the Rivet analysis system for the construction of\nMCgrid enhanced Rivet analyses. The interface is based around a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between a Rivet histogram class and a wrapper for an APPLgrid\ninterpolation grid. The Rivet system provides all of the analysis tools\nrequired to project a Monte Carlo weight upon an observable bin, and the MCgrid\npackage provides the correct conversion of the event weight to an APPLgrid fill\ncall. MCgrid has been tested and designed for use with the SHERPA event\ngenerator, however as with Rivet the package is suitable for use with any code\nwhich can produce events in the HepMC event record format.\n", "  We propose a small extenion of the minimal gauge mediation through the\ncombination of extended gauge mediation and conformal sequestering. We show\nthat the focus point supersymmetry can be realized naturally, and the\nfine-tuning is signifcantly reduced compared to the minimal gauge mediation and\nextended gauge mediation without focus point. The Higgs boson mass is around\n125 GeV, the gauginos remain light, and the gluino is likely to be detected at\nthe next run of the LHC. However, the multi-TeV squarks is out of the reach of\nthe LHC. The numerical calculation for finetuning shows that this model remains\nnatural.\n", "  Luminous tracers have been used extensively to map the large-scale matter\ndistribution in the Universe. Similarly the dynamics of stars or galaxies can\nbe used to estimate masses of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. However,\nassumptions need to be made about the dynamical state or how well galaxies\ntrace the underlying dark matter distribution. The gravitational tidal field\naffects the paths of photons, leading to observable effects. This phenomenon,\ngravitational lensing, has become an important tool in cosmology because it\nprobes the mass distribution directly. In these lecture notes we introduce the\nmain relevant quantities and terminology, but the subsequent discussion is\nmostly limited to weak gravitational lensing, the small coherent distortion of\nthe shapes of distant galaxies by intervening structures. We focus on some of\nthe issues in measuring accurate shapes and review the various applications of\nweak gravitational lensing, as well as some recent results.\n", "  We discuss the application of the two-band spin-dopon representation of the\nt-J model to address the issue of the Fermi surface reconstruction observed in\nthe cuprates. We show that the electron no double occupancy (NDO) constraint\nplays a key role in this formulation. In particular, the auxiliary lattice spin\nand itinerant dopon degrees of freedom of the spin-dopon formulation of the t-J\nmodel are shown to be confined in the emergent U(1) gauge theory generated by\nthe NDO constraint. This constraint is enforced by the requirement of an\ninfinitely large spin-dopon coupling. As a result, the t-J model is equivalent\nto a Kondo-Heisenberg lattice model of itinerant dopons and localized lattice\nspins at infinite Kondo coupling at all dopings. We show that mean-field\ntreatment of the large vs small Fermi surface crossing in the cuprates which\nleaves out the NDO constraint, leads to inconsistencies and it is automatically\nexcluded form the t - J model framework.\n", "  We demonstrate sub-wavelength sectioning on biological samples with a\nconventional confocal microscope. This optical sectioning is achieved by the\nphenomenon of supercritical angle fuorescence, wherein only a fluorophore next\nto the interface of a refractive index discontinuity can emit propagating\ncomponents of radiation into the so-called forbidden angles. The simplicity of\nthis technique allows it to be integrated with a high numerical aperture\nconfocal scanning microscope by only a simple modification on the detection\nchannel. Confocal-SAF microscopy would be a powerful tool to achieve high\nresolution surface imaging, especially for membrane imaging in biological\nsamples\n", "  LHAASO project is to be built in south-west China, which use an array of 5137\nelection detectors for the measurement of the incident electrons arriving at\nthe detector plane. For the quality control of the big quantity of electron\ndetectors, a cosmic ray hodoscope with two-dimensional spacial sensitivity and\ngood time resolution has been developed. The first prototype of electron\ndetector is tested with the hodoscope and the performance of the detector is\nvalidated to be consistent with the design.\n", "  We have demonstrated that a rather weak external optical feedback with delay\ncan lead to the mode switching of the counterpropogating modes. The delay time\nshould be longer then any system characteristic time. The equations describing\nthe ring resonator with the delayed optical feedback was obtained from the\nfirst principles. The analytical formula for the necessary external feedback\nstrength was derived. Other than the regular behavior, the system demonstrates\na complex chaotic behavior.\n", "  Meleshko presented a new method for reducing third order autonomous ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) to Lie linearizable second order ODEs. We\nextended his work by reducing fourth order autonomous ODEs to second and third\norder linearizable ODEs and then applying the Ibragimov and Meleshko\nlinearization test for the obtained ODEs. The application of the algorithm to\nseveral ODEs is also presented.\n", "  In this paper, we obtained the non-local residual symmetry related to\ntruncated Painlev\\'e expansion of Burgers equation. In order to localize the\nresidual symmetry, we introduced new variables to prolong the original Burgers\nequation into a new system. By using Lie's first theorem, we got the finite\ntransformation for the localized residual symmetry. More importantly, we also\nlocalized the linear superposition of multiple residual symmetries to find the\ncorresponding finite transformations. It is interesting to find that the nth\nB\u007facklund transformation for Burgers equation can be expressed by determinants\nin a compact way.\n", "  Using Monte Carlo simulations a lattice gas model with only repulsive\ninteractions was checked for the presence of anomalies. We show that this\nsystem exhibits the density (temperature of maximum density - TMD) and\ndiffusion anomalies as present in liquid water. These anomalous behavior exist\nin the region of the chemical potential vs temperature phase diagram where two\nstructured phases are present. A fragile-to-strong dynamic transition is also\nobserved in the vicinity of the TMD line.\n", "  We computationally investigate the chronoamperometric current response of\nspherical and cubic particles on a supporting insulating surface. By using the\nmethod of finite differences and random walk simulations, we can show that both\nsystems exhibit identical responses on all time scales if their exposed surface\nareas are equal. This result enables a simple and computationally effcient\nmethod to treat certain spherical geometries in random walk based noise\ninvestigations.\n", "  We report the existence of diverse routes of transition from amplitude death\n(AD) to oscillation death (OD) in three different diffusively coupled systems,\nthose are perturbed by a symmetry break- ing repulsive coupling link. For limit\ncycle systems the transition is through a pitchfork bifurcation (PB) as has\nbeen noted before, but in chaotic systems it can be through a saddle-node or a\ntrans- critical bifurcation depending on the nature of the underlying dynamics\nof the individual systems. The diversity of the routes and their dependence on\nthe complex dynamics of the coupled systems not only broadens our understanding\nof this important phenomenon but can lead to potentially new practical\napplications.\n", "  By studying Fe-doped ZnO pellets and thin films with various x-ray\nspectroscopic techniques, and complementing this with density functional theory\ncalculations, we find that Fe-doping in bulk ZnO induces isovalent (and\nisostructural) cation substitution (Fe2+ -> Zn2+). In contrast to this,\nFe-doping near the surface produces both isovalent and heterovalent\nsubstitution (Fe3+ -> Zn2+). The calculations performed herein suggest that the\nmost likely defect structure is the single or double substitution of Zn with\nFe, although, if additional oxygen is available, then Fe substitution with\ninterstitial oxygen is even more energetically favourable. Furthermore, it is\nfound that ferromagnetic states are energetically unfavourable, and\nferromagnetic ordering is likely to be realized only through the formation of a\nsecondary phase (i.e. ZnFe2O4), or codoping with Cu.\n", "  We propose a new type of laser resonator based on imaginary \"energy-level\nsplitting\" (imaginary coupling, or quality factor Q splitting) in a pair of\ncoupled microcavities. A particularly advantageous arrangement involves two\nmicroring cavities with different free-spectral ranges (FSRs) in a\nconfiguration wherein they are coupled by \"far-field\" interference in a shared\nradiation channel. A novel Vernier-like effect for laser resonators is designed\nwhere only one longitudinal resonant mode has a lower loss than the small\nsignal gain and can achieve lasing while all other modes are suppressed. This\nconfiguration enables ultra-widely tunable single-frequency lasers based on\neither homogeneously or inhomogeneously broadened gain media. The concept is an\nalternative to the common external cavity configurations for achieving tunable\nsingle-mode operation in a laser. The proposed laser concept builds on a high-Q\n\"dark state\" that is established by radiative interference coupling and bears a\ndirect analogy to parity-time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonians in optical systems.\nVariants of this concept should be extendable to parametric-gain based\noscillators, enabling use of ultrabroadband parametric gain for widely tunable\nsingle-frequency light sources.\n", "  We consider a family of exact boost invariant solutions of the transport\nequation for free streaming massless particles, where the one particle\ndistribution function is defined in terms of a function of a single variable.\nThe evolution of second and third moments of the one particle distribution\nfunction (the second moment being the energy momentum tensor (EMT) and the\nthird moment the non equilibrium current (NEC)) depends only on two moments of\nthat function. Given those two moments we show how to build a non linear\nhydrodynamic theory which reproduces the early time evolution of the EMT and\nthe NEC. The structure of these theories may give insight on nonlinear\nhydrodynamic phenomena on short time scales.\n", "  The transverse mass spectra of light mesons produced in Au-Au collisions at\n200 GeV/nucleon are analyzed in Tsallis statistics. In high energy collisions,\nit has been found that the spectra follow a generalized scaling law. We applied\nTsallis statistics to the description of different particles using the scaling\nproperties. The calculated results are in agreement with experimental data of\nPHENIX Collaboration. And, the temperature of emission sources is extracted\nconsistently.\n", "  We present a perturbation analysis of the semiclassical Wigner equation which\nis based on the interplay between configuration and phase spaces via Wigner\ntransform. We employ the so-called harmonic approximation of the Schr\u007fodinger\neigenfunctions for single-well potentials in configuration space, to construct\nan asymptotic expansion of the solution of the Wigner equation. This expansion\nis a perturbation of the Wigner function of a harmonic oscillator but it is not\na genuine semiclassical expansion because the correctors depend on the\nsemiclassical parameter. However, it suggests the selection of a novel ansatz\nfor the solution of the Wigner equation, which leads to an efficient regular\nperturbation scheme in phase space. The validity of the approximation is proved\nfor particular classes of initial data. The proposed ansatz is applied for\ncomputing the energy density of a a quartic oscillator on caustics (focal\npoints). The results are compared with those derived from the so-called\nclassical approximation whose principal term is the solution of Liouville\nequation with the same initial data. It turns out that the results are in good\napproximation when the coupling constant of the anharmonic potential has\ncertain dependence on the semiclassical parameter.\n", "  We presented background information about various entropies in the\nliterature. The pathway idea of Mathai (2005) is shown to be inferable from the\nmaximization of a certain generalized entropy measure and established\nconnections to outstanding problems in astronomy and physics. In this paper we\nproved that the generalized entropy of Mathai associated with diffusive\nprocesses grows linearly with the logarithm of time, and the rate of growth is\nindepen- dent of the generalized entropy parameter. We also proposed some\nresults concerning images of generalized Bessel function under the pathway\noperator and its special cases including some trigonometric functions.\nSituations are listed where a generalized entropy of order ? leads to pathway\nmodels, exponential and power law behavior and related differential equations.\n", "  In our own solar system, the necessity of understanding space weather is\nreadily evident. Fortunately for Earth, our nearest stellar neighbor is\nrelatively quiet, exhibiting activity levels several orders of magnitude lower\nthan young, solar-type stars. In protoplanetary systems, stellar magnetic\nphenomena observed are analogous to the solar case, but dramatically enhanced\non all physical scales: bigger, more energetic, more frequent. While coronal\nmass ejections (CMEs) could play a significant role in the evolution of\nprotoplanets, they could also affect the evolution of the central star itself.\nTo assess the consequences of prominence eruption/CMEs, we have invoked the\nsolar-stellar connection to estimate, for young, solar-type stars, how\nfrequently stellar CMEs may occur and their attendant mass and angular momentum\nloss rates. We will demonstrate the necessary conditions under which CMEs could\nslow stellar rotation.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate, with an all-optical setup, a nonlocal\ndeterministic quantum non-demolition interaction gate applicable to quantum\nstates at nodes separated by a physical distance and connected by classical\ncommunication channels. The gate implementation, based on entangled states\nshared in advance, local operations, and classical communication, runs\ncompletely in parallel fashion at both the local nodes, requiring minimum\nresource. The nondemolition character of the gate up to the local unitary\nsqueezing is verified by the analysis using several coherent states. A genuine\nquantum nature of the gate is confirmed by the capability of deterministically\nproducing an entangled state at the output from two separable input states. The\nall-optical nonlocal gate operation can be potentially incorporated into\ndistributed quantum computing with atomic or solid state systems as a\ncross-processor unitary operation.\n", "  The study of the neutrinoless double beta ($0 \\beta\\beta$) decay mode can\nprovide us with important information on the neutrino properties, particularly\non the electron neutrino absolute mass. In this work we revise the present\nconstraints on the neutrino mass parameters derived from the $0 \\beta\\beta$\ndecay analysis of the experimentally interesting nuclei. We use the latest\nresults for the phase space factors (PSFs) and nuclear matrix elements (NMEs),\nas well as for the experimental lifetimes limits. For the PSFs we use values\ncomputed with an improved method reported very recently. For the NMEs we use\nvalues chosen from literature on a case-by-case basis, taking advantage of the\nconsensus reached by the community on several nuclear ingredients used in their\ncalculation. Thus, we try to restrict the range of spread of the NME values\ncalculated with different methods and, hence, to reduce the uncertainty in\nderiving limits for the Majorana neutrino mass parameter. Our results may be\nuseful to have an up-date image on the present neutrino mass sensitivities\nassociated with $0 \\beta\\beta$ measurements for different isotopes and to\nbetter estimate the range of values of the neutrino masses that can be explored\nin the future double beta decay (DBD) experiments.\n", "  Spatial uctuations of spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW)\nin chromium have been compared by combining coherent and simultaneous X-ray\ndiffraction experiments. Despite their close relationship, spatial fluctuations\nof the spin and of the charge density waves display a very different behavior:\nthe satellite reflection associated to the charge density displays speckles\nwhile the spin one displays an impressive long-range order. This observation is\nhardly compatible with the commonly accepted magneto-elastic origin of CDW in\nchromium and is more consistent with a purely electronic scenario where CDW is\nthe second harmonic of SDW. A BCS model taking into account a second order\nnesting predicts correctly the existence of a CDW and explains why the CDW is\nmore sensitive to punctual defects.\n", "  The Einstein equations are non-linear and the particles of which the\ngravitational effect is described by these equations are lastly unknown. If\nrenormalizable fields are assumed, then results are obtained only in the case\nof a at space. Therefore, there is still no generally recognized quantum theory\nof gravitation and electromagnetism. In this work the solution of these quantum\nmechanic problems are forced in some sense: the metric tensor is linearized,\nand it is required that the entire system of equations is invariant with\nrespect to the symmetry group of the linearized Einstein equations. The field\nwhich represents this symmetry group only allows a measurement within the\nhorizon to simulate the event horizon. It is shown that the number of quants of\nthis field is constant. There are 4 types of solutions in the 2-quantum space,\nof which one has particle-like properties. This particular solution has a\ngravitational effect which can be externally arbitrarily small, as compared to\nits electromagnetic effect. In contrast, this does not apply to the other 3\nsolutions. The model might be used to explain why gravitation is so much weaker\nthan the electromagnetic interaction in real physics. Accordingly, the Higgs\nboson is possibly not necessarily be required for the mass scale. Likewise, an\nexplanation could be made why gravitation and electromagnetic inter- actions\nhad the same intensity during the early stages of the universe. A peculiarity\nof the model provides a mechanism for the Big Bang in all four types of\nsolutions, although there is no singularity. As a consequence of the inferred\nchange in the microstructure, a change in the macrostructure of the cosmos is\nsuggested, allowing an understanding of the particular properties of the Dark\nMatter and the accelerated expansion of the cosmos.\n", "  We investigate the optical response of quantum dot molecules coherently\ndriven by polarized laser light. Our description includes the splitting in\nexcitonic levels caused by isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions. We\nconsider interdot transitions mediated by hole tunneling between states with\nthe same total angular momentum and between bright and dark exciton states, as\nallowed by spin-flip hopping between the dots in the molecule. Using realistic\nexperimental parameters we demonstrate that the excitonic states coupled by\ntunneling exhibit a rich and controllable optical response. We show that\nthrough the appropriate control of an external electric field and light\npolarization, the tunneling coupling establishes an efficient destructive\nquantum interference path that creates a transparency window in the absorption\nspectra, whenever states of appropriate symmetry are mixed by the carrier\ntunneling. We explore the relevant parameter space that allows probing this\nphenomenon in experiments. Controlled variation of applied field and laser\ndetuning would allow the optical characterization of spin-preserving and\nspin-flip hopping amplitudes in such systems, by measuring the width of the\ntunneling-induced transparency windows.\n", "  We report a study of the lattice dynamics in superconducting NaFeAs (Tc = 8\nK) and doped NaFe0.97Co0.03As (Tc = 20 K) using Raman light scattering. Five of\nthe six phonon modes expected from group theory are observed. In contrast with\nresults obtained on iso-structural and iso-electronic LiFeAs, anomalous\nbroadening of Eg(As) and A1g(Na) modes upon cooling is observed in both\nsamples. In addition, in the Co-doped sample, a superconductivity-induced\nrenormalization of the frequency and linewidth of the B1g(Fe) vibration is\nobserved. This renormalization can not be understood within a single band and\nsimple multi-band approaches. A theoretical model that includes the effects of\nSDW correlations along with sign-changing s-wave pairing state and interband\nscattering has been developed to explain the observed behavior of the B1g(Fe)\nmode.\n", "  An innovative concept of thin-film organic solid-state laser is proposed,\nwith diffraction-limited output and a broad tuning range covering the visible\nspectrum under UV optical pumping. The laser beam is tunable over 230 nm, from\n440 to 670 nm, with a 3 nm full width at half maximum typical spectral width.\nThe structure consists of a compact fixed bulk optical cavity, a polymeric\nintracavity etalon for wavelength tuning, as well as five different disposable\nglass slides coated with a dye-doped polymer film, forming a very simple and\nlow-cost gain medium. The use of interchangeable/disposable \"gain capsules\" is\nan alternative solution to photodegradation issues, since gain chips can be\nreplaced without realignment of the cavity. The laser lifetime of a single chip\nin ambient conditions and without encapsulation was extrapolated to be around\n107 pulses at a microjoule energy-per-pulse level.\n", "  By combining density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function,\nwe study the electronic and transport properties of monolayer black phosphorus\nnanoribbons (PNRs). First, we investigate the band-gap of PNRs and its\nmodulation by the ribbon width and an external transverse electric feld. Our\ncalculations indicate a giant Stark effect in PNRs, which can switch on\ntransport channels of semiconducting PNRs under low bias, inducing an\ninsulator-metal-transition. Next, we study the transport channels in PNRs via\nthe calculations of the current density and local electron transmission\npathway. In contrast to graphene and MoS_2 nanoribbons, the carrier transport\nchannels under low bias are mainly located in the interior of both armchair and\nzigzag PNRs, and immune to a small amount of edge defects. Lastly, a device of\nthe PNR-based dual-gate feld-effect-transistor, with high on/off-ratio of 10^3,\nis proposed based on the giant electric feld tuning effect.\n", "  I consider skyrmionic states in non-centrosymmetric magnets near the ordering\ntemperatures. I show that the interaction between the chiral skyrmions, being\nrepulsive in a broad temperature range, changes into attraction at high\ntemperatures. This leads to a remarkable confinement effect: near the ordering\ntemperature skyrmions exist only as bound states. The confined skyrmions as\ndiscernible units may arrange in different mesophases. The confinement of\nmultiple skyrmions is a consequence of the coupling between the magnitude and\nthe angular part of the order parameter. Thus, near the ordering transitions, I\nconsider the local magnetization not only as multiply twisted but also\nlongitudinally modulated. From numerical investigations on 2D models of\nisotropic chiral ferromagnets, a staggered half-skyrmion square lattice at zero\nand low fields and a hexagonal skyrmion lattice at larger fields are found in\noverlapping regions of the phase diagram near the transition temperature. The\ncreation of skyrmions as stable units and their condensation into different\nextended textures occurs simultaneously through a rare case of an\ninstability-type nucleation transition1. As well, I introduce a new fundamental\nparameter, confinement temperature separating the peculiar region with\n\"confined\" chiral modulations from the main part of the phase diagram with\nregular helical and skyrmion states.\n", "  The resolution of conventional optical lenses is limited by the wavelength.\nMaterials with negative refractive index have been shown to enable the\ngeneration of an enhanced resolution image where both propagating and\nnon-propagating waves are employed. We analyze such a Veselago lens by\nexploiting some exact one dimensional integral expressions for the quasi-static\nelectric potential of a point charge in that system. Those were recently\nobtained by expanding that potential in the quasi-static eigenfunctions of a\nthree-flat-slabs composite structure. Numerical evaluations of those integrals,\nusing realistic values for physical parameters like the electric permittivities\nof the constituent slabs and their thickness, reveal some surprising effects:\nE.g., the maximum concentration of the electric field occurs not at the\ngeometric optics foci but at the interfaces between the negative permittivity\nslab and the positive permittivity slabs. The analysis provides simple\ncomputational guides for designing such structures in order to achieve enhanced\nresolution of an optical image.\n", "  We develop a Gaussian variational approach in replica space to investigate\nthe phase diagram of a one-dimensional interacting disordered topological\nsuperconducting wire in the strong coupling regime. This method allows for a\nnon-perturbative treatment in the disorder strength, electron- electron\ninteractions and the superconducting pairing amplitude. We find only two stable\nphases: a topological superconducting phase, and a glassy, non-topological\nlocalized phase, characterized by replica symmetry breaking.\n", "  The displacement of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) cantilevers is\nused to measure a broad variety of phenomena in devices ranging from force\nmicroscopes to biochemical sensors to thermal imaging systems. We demonstrate\nthe first direct measurement of a MEMS cantilever displacement with a noise\nfloor at 40% of the shot noise limit (SNL). By combining multi-spatial-mode\nquantum light sources with a simple differential measurement, we show that\nsub-SNL MEMS displacement sensitivity is highly accessible compared to previous\nefforts that measured the displacement of macroscopic mirrors with very\ndistinct spatial structures crafted with multiple optical parametric amplifiers\nand locking loops. These results support a new class of quantum MEMS sensor\nwith an ultimate signal to noise ratio determined by quantum correlations,\nenabling ultra-trace sensing, imaging, and microscopy applications in which\nsignals were previously obscured by shot noise.\n", "  We isolate single Schallamach waves --- detachment fronts that mediate\ninhomogeneous sliding between an elastomer and a hard surface --- to study\ntheir creation and dynamics. Based on measurements of surface displacement\nusing high-speed \\emph{in situ} imaging, we establish a Burgers vector for the\nwaves. The crystal dislocation analogues of nucleation stress, defect pinning\nand configurational force are demonstrated. It is shown that many\nexperimentally observed features can be quantitatively described using a\nconventional model of a dislocation line in an elastic medium. We also\nhighlight the evolution of nucleation features such as surface wrinkles, with\nconsequences for interface delamination.\n", "  We show here the existence of the indirect coupling of electron and magnetic\nor nuclear ion spins in self-assembled quantum dots mediated by\nelectron-electron interactions. With a single localized spin placed in the\ncenter of the dot, only the spins of electrons occupying the zero angular\nmomentum states couple directly to the localized spin. We show that when the\nelectron-electron interactions are included, the electrons occupying finite\nangular momentum orbitals interact with the localized spin. This effective\ninteraction is obtained using exact diagonalization of the microscopic\nHamiltonian as a function of the number of electronic shells, shell spacing,\nand anisotropy of the electron-Mn exchange interaction. The effective\ninteraction can be engineered to be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic\nby tuning the parameters of the quantum dot.\n", "  Context. More than 60 planets have been discovered so far in systems that\nharbour two stars, some of which have binary semi-major axes as small as 20 au.\nIt is well known that the formation of planets in such systems is strongly\ninfluenced by the stellar components, since the protoplanetary disc and the\nparticles within are exposed to the gravitational influence of the binary.\nHowever, the question on how self-gravitating protoplanetary bodies affect the\nevolution of a radiative, circumprimary disc is still open. Aims. We present\nour 2D hydrodynamical GPU-CPU code and study the interaction of several\nthousands of self-gravitating particles with a viscous and radiative\ncircumprimary disc within a binary star system. To our knowledge this program\nis the only one at the moment that is capable to handle this many particles and\nto calculate their influence on each other and on the disc. Methods. We\nperformed hydrodynamical simulations of a circumstellar disc assuming the\nbinary system to be coplanar. Our gridbased staggered mesh code relies on ideas\nfrom ZEUS-2D, where we implemented the FARGO algorithm and an additional energy\nequation for the radiative cooling according to opacity tables. To treat\nparticle motion we used a parallelised version of the precise Bulirsch - Stoer\nalgorithm. Four models in total where computed taking into account (i) only\nN-body interaction, (ii) N-body and disc interaction, (iii) the influence of\ncomputational parameters (especially smoothing) on N-body interaction, and (iv)\nthe influence of a quiet low-eccentricity disc while running model (ii). The\nimpact velocities where measured at two different time intervals and were\ncompared. Results. We show that the combination of disc- and N-body\nself-gravity can have a significant influence on the orbit evolution of roughly\nMoon sized protoplanets.\n", "  Recently, Liu et al. [Commun. Theor. Phys. 57, 583, 2012] proposed a quantum\nprivate comparison protocol based on entanglement swapping of Bell states,\nwhich aims to securely compare the equality of two participants' information\nwith the help of a semi-honest third party (TP). However, this study points out\nthere is a fatal loophole in this protocol, i.e., TP can obtain all of the two\nparticipants secret inputs without being detected through making a specific\nBell-basis measurement. To fix the problem, a simple solution, which uses\none-time eavesdropper checking with decoy photons instead of twice eavesdropper\nchecking with Bell states, is demonstrated. Compared with the original\nprotocol, it also reduces the Bell states consumption and simplifies the steps\nin the protocol.\n", "  A two-party quantum private comparison scheme using GHZ states and\nerror-correcting code (ECC) was introduced in Li et al.'s paper [Int. J. Theor.\nPhys. 52: 2818-2815, 2013], which holds the capability of fault-tolerate and\ncould be performed in a none-ideal scenario. However, this study points out\nthere exists a fatal loophole under a special attack, namely the\ntwice-Hadamard-CNOT attack. A malicious party may intercept the other's\nparticles, firstly executes the Hadamard operations on these intercepted\nparticles and his (her) own ones respectively, and then sequentially performs\ntwice CNOT operations on them and the auxiliary particles prepared in advance.\nAs a result, the secret input will be revealed without being detected through\nmeasuring the auxiliary particles. For resisting this special attack, an\nimprovement is proposed by applying a permutation operator before TP sends the\nparticle sequences to all the participants.\n", "  A longstanding challenge in the foundations of quantum mechanics is the\nverification of alternative collapse theories despite their mathematical\nsimilarity to decoherence. To this end, we suggest a novel method based on\ndynamical decoupling. Experimental observation of nonzero saturation of the\ndecoupling error in the limit of fast decoupling operations can provide\nevidence for alternative quantum theories. As part of the analysis we prove\nthat unbounded Hamiltonians can always be decoupled, and provide novel\ndilations of Lindbladians.\n", "  In the context of characterizing the structure of quantum entanglement in\nmany-body systems, we introduce the entanglement contour, a tool to identify\nwhich real-space degrees of freedom contribute, and how much, to the\nentanglement of a region A with the rest of the system B. The entanglement\ncontour provides a complementary, more refined approach to characterizing\nentanglement than just considering the entanglement entropy between A and B,\nwith several concrete advantages. We illustrate this in the context of ground\nstates and quantum quenches in fermionic quadratic systems. For instance, in a\nquantum critical system in $D = 1$ spatial dimensions, the entanglement contour\nallows us to determine the central charge of the underlying conformal field\ntheory from just a single partition of the system into regions A and B, (using\nthe entanglement entropy for the same task requires considering several\npartitions). In $D \\geq 2$ dimensions, the entanglement contour can distinguish\nbetween gapped and gapless phases that obey a same boundary law for\nentanglement entropy. During a local or global quantum quench, the\ntime-dependent contour provides a detailed account of the dynamics of\nentanglement, including propagating entanglement waves, which offers a\nmicroscopic explanation of the behavior of the entanglement entropy as a\nfunction of time.\n", "  We present the covariance analysis of two successful nuclear energy density\nfunctionals, (i) a non-relativistic Skyrme functional built from a zero-range\neffective interaction, and (ii) a relativistic nuclear energy density\nfunctional based on density dependent meson-nucleon couplings. The covariance\nanalysis is a useful tool for understanding the limitations of a model, the\ncorrelations between observables and the statistical errors. We show, for our\nselected test nucleus 208Pb, that when the constraint on a property A included\nin the fit is relaxed, correlations with other observables B become larger; on\nthe other hand, when a strong constraint is imposed on A, the correlations with\nother properties become very small. We also provide a brief review, partly\nconnected with the covariance analysis, of some instabilities displayed by\nseveral energy density functionals currently used in nuclear physics.\n", "  Density matrix embedding theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 186404 (2012)) and\ndensity embedding theory ((Phys. Rev. B 89, 035140 (2014)) have recently been\nintroduced for model lattice Hamiltonians and molecular systems. In the present\nwork, the formalism is extended to the ab initio description of infinite\nsystems. An appropriate definition of the impurity Hamiltonian for such systems\nis presented and demonstrated in cases of 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, using coupled\ncluster theory as the impurity solver. Additionally, we discuss the challenges\nrelated to disentanglement of fragment and bath states. The current approach\nyields results comparable to coupled cluster calculations of infinite systems\neven when using a single unit cell as the fragment. The theory is formulated in\nthe basis of Wannier functions but it does not require separate localization of\nunoccupied bands. The embedding scheme presented here is a promising way of\nemploying highly accurate electronic structure methods for extended systems at\na fraction of their original computational cost.\n", "  New experimental data about proton-proton collisions obtained atthe LHC allow\nto widen strongly the energy interval where one gets some knowledge about the\nstructure of their interaction region. Using the unitarity relation in\ncombination with experimental data about the elastic scattering in the\ndiffraction cone, it is shown how the shape and the darkness of the interaction\nregion of colliding protons change with increase of their energies. In\nparticular, the collisions become fully absorptive at small impact parameters\nat LHC energies that results in some special features of inelastic processes as\nwell. Possible evolution of the shape from the dark core at the LHC to the\nfully transparent one is discussed that implies the terminology of the black\ndisk would be replaced by the black torus. The parameter which determines the\nopacity of central collisions also plays a crucial role in the behavior of the\ndifferential cross section of elastic scattering outside the diffraction cone\nwhere the predictions of all phenomenological models failed at LHC energies.\nThe role of the ratio of real to imaginary part of the elastic scattering\namplitude at non-forward scattering becomes decisive there as seen from the\nunitarity condition. The obtained results allow to estimate this ratio outside\nthe diffraction cone for the first time by comparison with experiment at LHC\nenergies which happens to be drastically different from its values measured at\nforward scattering. Moreover, the behaviors of the real and imaginary parts\nseparately differ in different phenomeno- logical models and in the approach\nbased on the unitarity condition. This problem is still waiting for its\nresolution. All the conclusions are only obtained in the framework of the\nindubitable unitarity condition using experimental data about the elastic\nscattering.\n", "  In this paper, we study an adaptive spatial network. We consider an SIS\n(susceptible-infectedsusceptible) epidemic on the network, with a link/contact\nrewiring process constrained by spatial proximity. In particular, we assume\nthat susceptible nodes break links with infected nodes independently of\ndistance, and reconnect at random to susceptible nodes available within a given\nradius. By systematically manipulating this radius we investigate the impact of\nrewiring on the structure of the network and characteristics of the epidemic.\nWe adopt a step-by-step approach whereby we first study the impact of rewiring\non the network structure in the absence of an epidemic, then with nodes\nassigned a disease status but without disease dynamics, and finally running\nnetwork and epidemic dynamics simultaneously. In the case of no labelling and\nno epidemic dynamics, we provide both analytic and semi-analytic formulas for\nthe value of clustering achieved in the network. Our results also show that the\nrewiring radius and the network's initial structure have a pronounced effect on\nthe endemic equilibrium, with increasingly large rewiring radiuses yielding\nsmaller disease prevalence.\n", "  A Flux Coordinate Independent (FCI) approach for anisotropic systems, not\nbased on magnetic flux coordinates has been introduced in [F. Hariri and M.\nOttaviani, Comput. Phys. Commun., 184,2419 (2013)]. In this paper, we show that\nthe approach can tackle magnetic configurations including X-points. Using the\ncode FENICIA, an equilibrium with a magnetic island has been used to show the\nrobustness of the FCI approach to cases in which a magnetic separatrix is\npresent in the system, either by design or as a consequence of instabilities.\nNumerical results are in good agreement with the analytic solutions of the\nsound-wave propagation problem. Conservation properties are verified. Finally,\nthe critical gain of the FCI approach in situations including the magnetic\nseparatrix with an X-point is demonstrated by a fast convergence of the code\nwith the numerical resolution in the direction of symmetry. The results\nhighlighted in this paper show that the FCI approach should be able to address\nturbulent transport problems in X-point geometries.\n", "  We investigate proximity induced superconductivity in micrometer-long bismuth\nnanowires con- nected to superconducting electrodes with a high critical field.\nAt low temperature we measure a supercurrent that persists in magnetic fields\nas high as the critical field of the electrodes (above 11 T). The critical\ncurrent is also strongly modulated by the magnetic field. In certain samples we\nfind regular, rapid SQUID-like periodic oscillations occurring up to high\nfields. Other samples ex- hibit less periodic but full modulations of the\ncritical current on Tesla field scales, with field-caused extinctions of the\nsupercurrent. These findings indicate the existence of low dimensionally, phase\ncoherent, interfering conducting regions through the samples, with a subtle\ninterplay between orbital and spin contributions. We relate these surprising\nresults to the electronic properties of the surface states of bismuth, strong\nRashba spin-orbit coupling, large effective g factors, and their effect on the\ninduced superconducting correlations.\n", "  We present a practical scheme for measurement-device-independent polarization\nshift keying using two state polarization encoding. Most of the previous work\non optical free space laser communications through the atmosphere was\nconcentrated on intensity modulated systems. However, polarization modulated\nsystems may be more appropriate for such communication links, because the\npolarization seems to be the most stable characteristic of a laser beam while\npropagating through the atmosphere. Thus, a detailed comparison between\nintensity and polarization modulated systems is of much interest. We analyse\nthe noise in presence of simulated smoke and fog conditions within laboratory\nand propose a practical scheme for extracting message from the received data.\nThe proposed method uses only two detectors to analyse the polarizations and\nthe practical definition of state of polarization enables a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio even in presence of depolaration elements in atmosphere\nsuch as fog and smoke. The system also takes into account existing\nimperfections within the experimental setup and hence is more robust.\n", "  Vector and scalar potential formulation is valid from quantum theory to\nclassical electromagnetics. The rapid development in quantum optics calls for\nelectromagnetic solutions that straddle quantum physics as well as classical\nphysics. The vector potential formulation is a good candidate to bridge these\ntwo regimes. Hence, there is a need to generalize this formulation to\ninhomogeneous media. A generalized gauge is suggested for solving\nelectromagnetic problems in inhomogenous media which can be extended to the\nanistropic case. The advantages of the resulting equations are their absence of\nlow-frequency catastrophe. Hence, usual differential equation solvers can be\nused to solve them over multi-scale and broad bandwidth. It is shown that the\ninterface boundary conditions from the resulting equations reduce to those of\nclassical Maxwell's equations. Also, classical Green's theorem can be extended\nto such a formulation, resulting in similar extinction theorem, and surface\nintegral equation formulation for surface scatterers. The integral equations\nalso do not exhibit low-frequency catastrophe as well as frequency imbalance as\nobserved in the classical formulation using E-H fields. The matrix\nrepresentation of the integral equation for a PEC scatterer is given.\n", "  Two dimensional effective Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac electron\ninteracting with a hyperbolic magnetic field is discussed within PT symmetry.\nFactorization method and polynomial procedures are used to solve Dirac equation\nfor the constant Fermi velocity and the effective potential which is complex\nScarf II potential. The more general effective Scarf II potential models are\nalso obtained within pseudo-supersymmetry. Finally, an extension of Panella and\nRoy's work [12] to the both PT symmetric and real Scarf II partner potentials\nare given using the position dependent Fermi velocity.\n", "  The temperature dependence (10-290 K) of the low-frequency (20-150 cm-1)\nRaman-active phonon modes of supercooled confined water in L,L-diphenylalanine\nmicro/nanotubes was analysed. The isolated dynamics of a specific geometry of\nwater cluster (pentamer) in supercooled confined regime was studied in detail.\nA particular mode concerning water-nanotube interaction was also probed. A\nfragile-to-strong transition at 204 K was observed and related to the crossing\nof the Widom line. The critical exponent analyses of the relaxation rate data\nbased on mode-coupling theory indicated perfect agreement among experimental\ndata and theory. Our results are consistent with the existence of a second\ncritical point of water.\n", "  The time dependent transient lateral photovoltaic effect has been studied\nwith us time resolution and with chopping frequencies in the kHz range, in\nlithographically patterned 21 nm thick, 5, 10 and 20 um wide and 1500 um long\nCo lines grown over naturally passivated p-type Si (100). We have observed a\nnearly linear dependence of the transitorial response with the laser spot\nposition. A transitorial response with a sign change in the laser-off stage has\nbeen corroborated by numerical simulations. A qualitative explanation suggests\na modification of the drift-diffusion model by including the in uence of a\nlocal inductance. Our findings indicate that the microstructuring of position\nsensitive detectors could improve their space-time resolution.\n", "  A Josephson supercurrent has been induced into the three-dimensional\ntopological insulator Bi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3. We show that the transport in\nBi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 exfoliated flakes is dominated by surface states and that\nthe bulk conductivity can be neglected at the temperatures where we study the\nproximity induced superconductivity. We prepared Josephson junctions with\nwidths in the order of 40 nm and lengths in the order of 50 to 80 nm on several\nBi1.5Sb0.5Te1.7Se1.3 flakes and measured down to 30 mK. The Fraunhofer patterns\nunequivocally reveal that the supercurrent is a Josephson supercurrent. The\nmeasured critical currents are reproducibly observed on different devices and\nupon multiple cooldowns, and the critical current dependence on temperature as\nwell as magnetic field can be well explained by diffusive transport models and\ngeometric effects.\n", "  Motivated by the observational results of Braun (1995), we extend the model\nof Hanson & Cally (2014) to address the effect of multiple scattering of f and\np-modes by an ensemble of thin vertical magnetic flux tubes in the surface\nlayers of the Sun. As in observational Hankel analysis we measure the scatter\nand phase shift from an incident cylindrical wave in a coordinate system\nroughly centred in the core of the ensemble. It is demonstrated that, although\nthin flux tubes are unable to interact with high order fluting modes\nindividually, they can indirectly absorb energy from these waves through the\nscatters of kink and sausage components. It is also shown how the distribution\nof absorption and phase shift across the azimuthal order m depends strongly on\nthe tube position, as well as on the individual tube characteristics. This is\nthe first analytical study into an ensembles multiple scattering regime, that\nis embedded within a stratified atmosphere.\n", "  We present a new galaxy survey simulation package, which combines the power\nof Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with a robust and adaptable model\nof galaxy evolution. The aim of this code is to aid in the characterization and\nstudy of new and existing galaxy surveys. In this paper we briefly describe the\nMCMC implementation and the survey simulation methodology and associated tools.\nA test case of this full suite was to constrain the evolution of the IR\nLuminosity Function (LF) based on the HerMES (Herschel SPIRE) survey of the\nSpitzer First Look Survey field. The initial results are consistent with\nprevious studies, but our more general approach should be of wider benefit to\nthe community.\n", "  We study the slow dynamics of salol by varying both temperature and pressure\nusing photon correlation spectroscopy and pressure-volume-temperature\nmeasurements, and compare the behavior of the structural relaxation time with\nequations derived within the Adam-Gibbs entropy theory and the Cohen-Grest free\nvolume theory. We find that pressure dependent data are crucial to assess the\nvalidity of these model equations. Our analysis supports the entropy-based\nequation, and estimates the configurational entropy of salol at ambient\npressure ? 70% of the excess entropy. Finally, we investigate the evolution of\nthe shape of the structural relaxation process, and find that a\ntime-temperature-pressure superposition principle holds over the range\ninvestigated.\n", "  We investigate the quantum networks that their nodes are considered as\nquantum harmonic oscillators. The entanglement of the ground state can be used\nto quantify the amount of information one part of a network shares with the\nother part of the system. The networks which we studied in this paper, are\ncalled strongly regular graphs (SRG). These kinds of graphs have some special\nproperties like they have three strata in the stratification basis. The Schur\ncomplement method is used to calculate the Schmidt number and entanglement\nentropy between two parts of graph. We could obtain analytically, all blocks of\nadjacency matrix in several important kinds of strongly regular graphs. Also\nthe entanglement entropy in the large coupling limit is considered in these\ngraphs and the relationship between Entanglement entropy and the ratio of size\nof boundary to size of the system is found. Then, area-law is studied to show\nthat there are no entanglement entropy for the highest size of system. Then,\nthe graph isomorphism problem is considered in SRGs by using the elements of\nblocks of adjacency matrices. Two SRGs with the same parameters:\n$(\\eta,\\kappa,\\lambda,\\nu)$ are isomorphic if they can be made identical by\nrelabeling their vertices. So the adjacency matrices of two isomorphic SRGs\nbecome identical by replacing of rows and columns. The nonisomirph SRGs could\nbe distinguished by using the elements of blocks of adja- cency matrices in the\nstratification basis, numerically.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement of the ground state in the quantum networks\nthat their nodes are considered as quantum harmonic oscillators. To this aim,\nthe Schmidt numbers and entanglement entropy between two arbitrary partitions\nof a network, are calculated. In partitioning an arbitrary graph into two parts\nthere are some nodes in each parts which are not connected to the nodes of the\nother part. So these nodes of each part, can be in distinct subsets. Therefore\nthe graph separates into four subsets. The nodes of the first and last subsets\nare those which are not connected to the nodes of other part. In theorem I, by\nusing generalized Schur complement method in these four subsets, we prove that\nall graphs which their connections between all two alternative subsets are\ncomplete, have the same entropy. A large number of graphs satisfy this theorem.\nThen the entanglement entropy in the limit of large coupling and large size of\nsystem, is investigated in these graphs. One of important quantities about\npartitioning, is conductance of graph. The con- ductance of graph is considered\nin some various graphs. In these graphs we compare the conductance of graph and\nthe entanglement entropy.\n", "  We propose a class of linear elastic three-dimensional metamaterials for\nwhich the effective parameters bulk modulus and mass density can be adjusted\nindependently over a large range|which is not possible for ordinary materials.\nFirst, we systematically evaluate the static mechanical properties and the\nphonon dispersion relations. We show that the two are quantitatively consistent\nin the long-wavelength limit. To demonstrate the feasibility, corresponding\nfabricated polymer microstructures are presented. Finally, we discuss\ncalculations for laminates composed of alternating layers of two different\nmetamaterials with equal bulk modulus yet different mass density. This leads to\nmetamaterials with effectively anisotropic uniaxial dynamic mass density\ntensors.\n", "  The use of Bell's theorem in any application or experiment relies on the\nassumption of free choice or, more precisely, measurement independence, meaning\nthat the measurements can be chosen freely. Here, we prove that even in the\nsimplest Bell test - one involving 2 parties each performing 2 binary-outcome\nmeasurements - an arbitrarily small amount of measurement independence is\nsufficient to manifest quantum nonlocality. To this end, we introduce the\nnotion of measurement dependent locality and show that the corresponding\ncorrelations form a convex polytope. These correlations can thus be\ncharacterized efficiently, e.g., using a finite set of Bell-like inequalities -\nan observation that enables the systematic study of quantum nonlocality and\nrelated applications under limited measurement independence.\n", "  The wake field excitation in an unmagnetized plasma by a multi-petawatt,\nfemtosecond, pancake-shaped laser pulse is described both analytically and\nnumerically in the regime with ultrarelativistic electron jitter velocities,\nwhen the plasma electrons are almost expelled from the pulse region. This is\ndone, for the first time, in fluid theory. A novel mathematical model is\ndevised that does not break down for very intense pump strengths, in contrast\nto the standard approach that uses the laser field envelope and the\nponderomotive guiding center averaging. This is accomplished by employing a\nthree-timescale description, with the intermediate scale associated with the\nnonlinear phase of the electromagnetic wave and with the bending of its wave\nfront. The evolution of the pulse and of its electrostatic wake are studied by\nthe numerical solution in a two-dimensional geometry, with the spot diameter\n\\geq 100 microns. It reveals that the optimum initial pulse length needs to be\nsomewhat bigger than 1 micron (1-2 oscillations), as suggested by simple\nanalytical local estimates, because the nonlocal plasma response tends to\nstretch very short pulses.\n", "  Magnetic B-type stars are often host to Centrifugal Magnetospheres (CMs).\nHere we describe the results of a population study encompassing the full sample\nof known magnetic early B-type stars, focusing on those with detectable CMs. We\npresent revised rotational and magnetic parameters for some stars, clarifying\ntheir positions on the rotation-confinement diagram, and? find that plasma\ndensities within their CMs are much lower than those predicted by centrifugal\nbreakout.\n", "  We present an overview of the theoretical understanding of Hofstadter\nbutterflies in monolayer and bilayer graphene. After a brief introduction on\nthe past work in conventional semiconductor systems, we discuss the novel\nelectronic properties of monolayer and bilayer graphene that helped to detect\nexperimentally the fractal nature of the energy spectrum. We have discussed the\ntheoretical background on the Moir\\'e pattern in graphene. This pattern was\ncrucial in determining the butterfly structure. We have also touched upon the\nrole of electron-electron interaction in the butterfly pattern in graphene. We\nconclude by discussing the future prospects of butterfly search, especially for\ninteracting Dirac fermions.\n", "  We analyse, theoretically and experimentally, the nature of solitonic\nvortices (SV) in an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate. In the experiment, such\ndefects are created via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, when the temperature of a\ngas of sodium atoms is quenched across the BEC transition, and are imaged after\na free expansion of the condensate. By using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we\ncalculate the in-trap density and phase distributions characterizing a SV in\nthe crossover from an elongate quasi-1D to a bulk 3D regime. The simulations\nshow that the free expansion strongly amplifies the key features of a SV and\nproduces a remarkable twist of the solitonic plane due to the quantized\nvorticity associated with the defect. Good agreement is found between\nsimulations and experiments.\n", "  We have investigated the crystal and magnetic structures of the trigonal\niron-boracite Fe3B7O13X with X = OH by neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction\nenables us to locate the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group and determine the\nmagnetic ground state of this member of the multiferroic boracite family. No\nevidence was found for a monoclinic distortion in the magnetic ordered state.\nThe magnetic symmetry allows for magnetoelectric and ferroelectric properties.\nThe N/'eel tempera- ture TN of 4.86(4) K confirms the general trends within the\nboracites that TN decreases from X = I > Br > Cl > OH. Surprisingly while\nFe3B7O13OH exhibits the largest frustration with $|\\theta/T_N| = 5.6$ within\nthe Fe3B7O13X series, no reduction of the magnetic moment is found using\nneutron diffraction.\n", "  We predict that a lateral electrical current in antiferromagnets can induce\nnon-equilibrium N\\'eel order fields, i.e. fields whose sign alternates between\nthe spin sublattices, which can trigger ultra-fast spin-axis reorientation.\nBased on microscopic transport theory calculations we identify staggered\ncurrent-induced fields analogous to the intra-band and to the intrinsic\ninter-band spin-orbit fields previously reported in ferromagnets with a broken\ninversion-symmetry crystal. To illustrate their rich physics and utility, we\nconsidered bulk Mn2Au with the two spin sublattices forming inversion partners,\nand a 2D square-lattice antiferromagnet with broken structural inversion\nsymmetry modelled by a Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We propose an AFM memory\ndevice with electrical writing and reading.\n", "  The paper considers the general case of incompressible non-classical\nelasticity with small deformations and rotations. The thermodynamic stability\nis analysed for free energy density with three rotational degrees of freedom.\nAlthough the theory generally predicts the stress to be non-symmetric, the\nstress tensor can still be considered as symmetrical in the absence of external\nfields and when the inertia effects of internal rotations and couple stresses\nare neglected. When the condition of stress tensor symmetry is applied, it\nresults in simplified, \"reduced\" expressions for the free energy density and\nstress, which preserve the general stability conditions and allow easy\ncalculations of stress-strain relations and rotations. Using this reduced\nformulation, a general condition of existence of soft deformations is analysed\nfor the weak nematic elasticity. The reduction procedure is exemplified using\nthe infinitesimal Warner potential derived from a molecular model.\n", "  Al1-xCrxN thin films with $0.02\\le x \\le 0.1$ were deposited by reactive\nco-sputtering onto c-plane (001) sapphire. Room-temperature ferromagnetism with\na coercive field of 85 Oe was observed in samples with chromium contents as low\nas x = 0.027 (2.7%). With increasing Cr content the mean magnetic moment is\nstrongly suppressed, with a maximum saturation moment of 0.62 and 0.71 $\\mu_B$\nper Cr atom at 300 and 50 K respectively. We show that the Curie temperature of\nAl1-xCrxN for x = 0.027 is greater than 900 K.\n"]}
