First we prove\nStrichartz-type estimates in $ L_{t}^{q} L_{x}^{r} $ spaces. Then by using\nthese decays we establish some local bounds. By combining these results with a\nMorawetz-type estimate and a radial Sobolev inequality we control the variation\nof an almost conserved quantity on arbitrarily large intervals. Once we have\nshowed that this quantity is controlled, we prove that some of these local\nbounds can be upgraded to global bounds. This is enough to establish\nscattering. All the estimates involved require a delicate analysis due to the\nnature of the nonlinearity and the lack of scaling.\n", "  We devise a microscopic scattering approach to probe the excitation spectrum\nof a Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the experimentally accessible\nscattering cross section exhibits universal Ericson fluctuations, with\ncharacteristic properties rooted in the underlying classical field equations.\n", "  Biological rhythms are generated by pacemaker organs, such as the heart\npacemaker organ (the sinoatrial node) and the master clock of the circadian\nrhythms (the suprachiasmatic nucleus), which are composed of a network of\nautonomously oscillatory cells. Such biological rhythms have notable\nperiodicity despite the internal and external noise present in each cell.\nPrevious experimental studies indicate that the regularity of oscillatory\ndynamics is enhanced when noisy oscillators interact and become synchronized.\nThis effect, called the collective enhancement of temporal precision, has been\nstudied theoretically using particular assumptions. In this study, we propose a\ngeneral theoretical framework that enables us to understand the dependence of\ntemporal precision on network parameters including size, connectivity, and\ncoupling intensity; this effect has been poorly understood to date. Our\nframework is based on a phase oscillator model that is applicable to general\noscillator networks with any coupling mechanism if coupling and noise are\nsufficiently weak. In particular, we can manage general directed and weighted\nnetworks. We quantify the precision of the activity of a single cell and the\nmean activity of an arbitrary subset of cells. We find that, in general\nundirected networks, the standard deviation of cycle-to-cycle periods scales\nwith the system size $N$ as $1/\\sqrt{N}$, but only up to a certain system size\n$N^*$ that depends on network parameters. Enhancement of temporal precision is\nineffective when $N>N^*$. We also reveal the advantage of long-range\ninteractions among cells to temporal precision.\n", "  In this work we compute subleading oscillating terms in the Renyi entropy of\nFermi gases and Fermi liquids corresponding to $2k_F$-like oscillations. Our\ntheoretical tools are the one dimensional formulation of Fermi liquid\nentanglement familiar from discussions of the logarithmic violation of the area\nlaw and quantum Monte Carlo calculations. The main result is a formula for the\noscillating term for any region geometry and a spherical Fermi surface. We\ncompare this term to numerical calculations of entanglement using the\ncorrelation function method and find excellent agreement. We also compare with\nquantum Monte Carlo data on interacting Fermi liquids where we also find\nexcellent agreement up to moderate interaction strengths.\n", "  Studying the trajectories of objects like stars, globular clusters or\nsatellite galaxies in the Milky Way allows to trace the dark matter halo but\nrequires reliable models of its gravitational potential. Realistic, yet simple\nand fully analytical models have already been presented in the past. However,\nimproved as well as new observational constraints have become available in the\nmeantime calling for a recalibration of the respective model parameters. Three\nwidely used model potentials are revisited. By a simultaneous least-squared fit\nto the observed rotation curve, in-plane proper motion of Sgr A*, local\nmass/surface density and the velocity dispersion in Baade's window, parameters\nof the potentials are brought up-to-date. The mass at large radii - and thus in\nparticular that of the dark matter halo - is hereby constrained by imposing\nthat the most extreme halo blue horizontal-branch star known has to be bound to\nthe Milky Way. The Galactic mass models are tuned to yield a very good match to\nrecent observations. The mass of the dark matter halo is - within the\nlimitations of the applied models - estimated in a fully consistent way. As a\nfirst application, the trajectory of the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439 is\nre-investigated to check its suggested origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). Despite their simplicity, the presented Milky Way mass models are well\nable to reproduce all observational constraints. Their analytical and simple\nform makes them ideally suited for fast and accurate orbit calculations. The\nLMC cannot be ruled out as HE 0437-5439's birthplace.\n", "  A Poisson pencil is called flat if all brackets of the pencil can be\nsimultaneously locally brought to a constant form. Given a Poisson pencil on a\n3-manifold, we study under which conditions it is flat. Since the works of\nGelfand and Zakharevich, it is known that a pencil is flat if and only if the\nassociated Veronese web is trivial. We suggest a simpler obstruction to\nflatness, which we call the curvature form of a Poisson pencil. This form can\nbe defined in two ways: either via the Blaschke curvature form of the\nassociated web, or via the Ricci tensor of a connection compatible with the\npencil. We show that the curvature form of a Poisson pencil can be given by a\nsimple explicit formula. This allows us to study flatness of linear pencils on\nthree-dimensional Lie algebras, in particular those related to the argument\ntranslation method. Many of them appear to be non-flat.\n", "  Using the tools of random matrix theory we develop a statistical analysis of\nthe transport properties of thermoelectric low-dimensional systems made of two\nelectron reservoirs set at different temperatures and chemical potentials, and\nconnected through a low-density-of-states two-level quantum dot that acts as a\nconducting chaotic cavity. Our exact treatment of the chaotic behavior in such\ndevices lies on the scattering matrix formalism and yields analytical\nexpressions for the joint probability distribution functions of the Seebeck\ncoefficient and the transmission profile, as well as the marginal\ndistributions, at arbitrary Fermi energy. The scattering matrices belong to\ncircular ensembles which we sample to numerically compute the transmission\nfunction, the Seebeck coefficient, and their relationship. The exact transport\ncoefficients probability distributions are found to be highly non-Gaussian for\nsmall numbers of conduction modes, and the analytical and numerical results are\nin excellent agreement. The system performance is also studied, and we find\nthat the optimum performance is obtained for half-transparent quantum dots;\nfurther, this optimum may be enhanced for systems with few conduction modes.\n", "  Given an $\\widetilde n$-dimensional manifold $\\widetilde M$ equipped with a\n$\\widetilde G$-structure $\\widetilde\\pi:\\widetilde P\\rightarrow \\widetilde M$,\nthere is a naturally induced $G$-structure $\\pi: P\\rightarrow M$ on any\nsubmanifold $M\\subset\\widetilde M$ that satisfies appropriate regularity\nconditions. We study generalized integrability problems for a given\n$G$-structure $\\pi: P\\rightarrow M$, namely the questions of whether it is\nlocally equivalent to induced $G$-structures on regular submanifolds of\nhomogeneous $\\widetilde G$-structures $\\widetilde\\pi:\\widetilde P\\to\n\\widetilde{H}/\\widetilde{K}$. If $\\widetilde\\pi:\\widetilde P\\to\n\\widetilde{H}/\\widetilde{K}$ is flat $k$-reductive we introduce a sequence of\ngeneralized curvatures taking values in appropriate cohomology groups and prove\nthat the vanishing of these curvatures are necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the solution of the corresponding generalized integrability problems.\n", "  The dynamics of stochastic systems, both classical and quantum, can be\nstudied by analysing the statistical properties of dynamical trajectories. The\nproperties of ensembles of such trajectories for long, but fixed, times are\ndescribed by large-deviation (LD) rate functions. These LD functions play the\nrole of dynamical free-energies: they are cumulant generating functions for\ntime-integrated observables, and their analytic structure encodes dynamical\nphase behaviour. This \"thermodynamics of trajectories\" approach is to\ntrajectories and dynamics what the equilibrium ensemble method of statistical\nmechanics is to configurations and statics. Here we show that, just like in the\nstatic case, there is a variety of alternative ensembles of trajectories, each\ndefined by their global constraints, with that of trajectories of fixed total\ntime being just one of these. We show that an ensemble of trajectories where\nsome time-extensive quantity is constant (and large) but where total\nobservation time fluctuates, is equivalent to the fixed-time ensemble, and the\nLD functions that describe one ensemble can be obtained from those that\ndescribe the other. We discuss how the equivalence between generalised\nensembles can be exploited in path sampling schemes for generating rare\ndynamical trajectories.\n", "  We formulate a theory for the collective phase description of globally\ncoupled noisy limit-cycle oscillators exhibiting macroscopic rhythms.\nCollective phase equations describing such macroscopic rhythms are derived by\nmeans of a two-step phase reduction. The collective phase sensitivity and\ncollective phase coupling functions, which quantitatively characterize the\nmacroscopic rhythms, are illustrated using three representative models of\nlimit-cycle oscillators. As an important result of the theory, we demonstrate\nnoise-induced anti-phase synchronization between macroscopic rhythms by direct\nnumerical simulations of the three models.\n", "  We calculated the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ of\nhole-doped CuBO$_2$, CuAlO$_2$, CuGaO$_2$ and CuInO$_2$ using first-principles.\nThe calculated $T_{\\rm c}$ are about 50 K for CuAlO$_2$, 10 K for CuBO$_2$ and\nCuGaO$_2$ and 1 K for CuInO$_2$ at maximum in the optimum hole-doping\nconcentration. The low $T_{\\rm c}$ of CuInO$_2$ is attributed to the weak\nelectron-phonon interaction caused by the low covalency and heavy atomic mass.\n", "  We study pattern formation in a reaction-diffusion system for a benthic\nbacteria-nutrient model in a marine sediment, which originally contains some\nspatially varying coefficients and with these shows some layering of patterns.\nUsing the Landau reduction for the system with homogeneous coefficients, we\nlocally analyze Turing bifurcations in 1D and 2D. Moreover, we use the software\npde2path to compute the corresponding branches globally and find a number of\nsnaking branches of patterns over patterns. This shows that spatially varying\npatterns are not necessarily due to spatially varying coefficients. We find a\ntype of hexagon patches on a homogeneous background with no prior mention in\nthe literature. We show the first numerically calculated solution-branch, which\nconnects two different types of hexagons in parameter space. We call states on\nthis branch rectangles. We check numerically, if the stability changes for\nhexagons and stripes, which are continued homogeneously into the third\ndimension. We find that stripes and one type of hexagons have the same stable\nrange over bounded 2D and 3D domains, while the other type of hexagons becomes\nunstable earlier. Here we find a snaking branch of solutions, which are spatial\nconnects between hexagonal prisms and a genuine 3D pattern (balls).\n", "  Smooth Gowdy-symmetric generalized Taub-NUT solutions are a class of\ninhomogeneous cosmological models with spatial three-sphere topology. They have\na past Cauchy horizon with closed null-generators, and they are generally\nexpected to develop a second Cauchy horizon in the future. Here we generalize\nthese models to allow for past Cauchy horizons ruled by non-closed null\ngenerators. In particular, we show local and global existence of such a class\nof solutions with two functional degrees of freedom. This removes a periodicity\ncondition for the asymptotic data at the past Cauchy horizon that was required\nbefore. Moreover, we derive a three-parametric family of exact solutions within\nthat class and study some of its properties.\n", "  Enrico Fermi was one of the greater physicists of the XX century. In 1934, he\ngave several lectures in Brazil. Invited by Theodoro Ramos to work in S\\~ao\nPaulo, he preferred to stay in Rome and went to the USA in 1938. However, Fermi\nrecommended Gleb Wataghin to come in his place. Wataghin made history in\nBrazil, becoming one of the first Professors of the future S\\~ao Paulo\nUniversity. Besides his relevance to the History of Science, Fermi eventually\nleaved an indelible mark on the creation and institutionalization of national\nscientific research due to the indication of Wataghin. Despite this fact, very\nlittle is known about Fermi's trip to Brazil. This work tries to reconstruct\nthe fullest possible steps of the famous Italian physicist in our lands.\n", "  We formulate a theory for the phase description of oscillatory convection in\na cylindrical Hele-Shaw cell that is laterally periodic. This system possesses\nspatial translational symmetry in the lateral direction owing to the\ncylindrical shape as well as temporal translational symmetry. Oscillatory\nconvection in this system is described by a limit-torus solution that possesses\ntwo phase modes; one is a spatial phase and the other is a temporal phase. The\nspatial and temporal phases indicate the position and oscillation of the\nconvection, respectively. The theory developed in this paper can be considered\nas a phase reduction method for limit-torus solutions in infinite-dimensional\ndynamical systems, namely, limit-torus solutions to partial differential\nequations representing oscillatory convection with a spatially translational\nmode. We derive the phase sensitivity functions for spatial and temporal\nphases; these functions quantify the phase responses of the oscillatory\nconvection to weak perturbations applied at each spatial point. Using the phase\nsensitivity functions, we characterize the spatiotemporal phase responses of\noscillatory convection to weak spatial stimuli and analyze the spatiotemporal\nphase synchronization between weakly coupled systems of oscillatory convection.\n", "  Some ideas aimed to understand that time is one-dimensional are briefly\nreviewed. Some attempts to construct theories in varieties with more spatial\nand temporal components are presented. It is discussed, from the\nepistemological point of view, which path can be taken to try to \"prove\" the\none-dimensionality of time (or the three-dimensionality of space) from these\ngeneralized theories.\n", "  Recently there has been growing interest in extending the thermodynamic\nmethod from static configurations to dynamical trajectories. In this approach,\nensembles of trajectories are treated in an analogous manner to ensembles of\nconfigurations in equilibrium statistical mechanics: generating functions of\ndynamical observables are interpreted as partition sums, and the statistical\nproperties of trajectory ensembles are encoded in free-energy functions that\ncan be obtained through large-deviation methods in a suitable large time limit.\nThis establishes what one can call a 'thermodynamics of trajectories'. In this\npaper we go a step further, and make a first connection to fluctuation theorems\nby generalising them to this dynamical context. We show that an effective\n'meta-dynamics' in the space of trajectories gives rise to the celebrated\nJarzynski relation connecting an appropriately defined 'meta-work' with changes\nin dynamical generating functions. We demonstrate the potential applicability\nof this result to computer simulations for two open quantum systems, a\ntwo-level system and the micromaser. We finally discuss the behavior of the\nJarzynski relation across a first-order trajectory phase transition.\n", "  We give an analogy between non-reversible Markov chains and electric networks\nmuch in the flavour of the classical reversible results originating from\nKakutani, and later Kem\\'eny-Snell-Knapp and Kelly. Non-reversibility is made\npossible by a voltage multiplier -- a new electronic component. We prove that\nabsorption probabilities, escape probabilities, expected number of jumps over\nedges and commute times can be computed from electrical properties of the\nnetwork as in the classical case. The central quantity is still the effective\nresistance, which we do have in our networks despite the fact that individual\nparts cannot be replaced by a simple resistor. We rewrite a recent\nnon-reversible result of Gaudilli\\`ere-Landim about the Dirichlet and Thomson\nprinciples into the electrical language. We also give a few tools that can help\nin reducing and solving the network. The subtlety of our network is, however,\nthat the classical Rayleigh monotonicity is lost.\n", "  Astronomers have been using the measured luminosity to estimate the {\\em\nluminous mass} of stars, based on empirically established mass-to-light ratio\nwhich seems to be only applicable to a special class of stars---the\nmain-sequence stars---with still considerable uncertainties. Another basic tool\nto determine the mass of a system of stars or galaxies comes from the study of\ntheir motion, as Newton demonstrated with his law of gravitation, which yields\nthe {\\em gravitational mass}. Because the luminous mass can at best only\nrepresent a portion of the gravitational mass, finding the luminous mass to be\ndifferent or less than the gravitational mass should not be surprising. Using\nsuch an apparent discrepancy as a compelling evidence for the so-called dark\nmatter, which has been believed to possess mysterious nonbaryonic properties\nand present a dominant amount in galaxies and the universe, seems to be too far\na stretch when seriously examining the facts and uncertainties in the\nmeasurement techniques. In our opinion, a galaxy with star type distribution\nvarying from its center to edge may have a mass-to-light ratio varying\naccordingly. With the thin-disk model computations based on measured rotation\ncurves, we found that most galaxies have a typical mass density profile that\npeaks at the galactic center and decreases rapidly within $\\sim 5%$ of the\ncut-off radius, and then declines nearly exponentially toward the edge. The\npredicted mass density in the Galactic disk is reasonably within the reported\nrange of that observed in interstellar medium. This leads us to believe that\nordinary baryonic matter can be sufficient for supporting the observed galactic\nrotation curves; speculation of large amount of non-baryonic matter may be\nbased on an ill-conceived discrepancy between gravitational mass and luminous\nmass which appears to be unjustified.\n", "  We have performed accurate simulations of the Deuterium Hugoniot using\nCoupled Electron Ion Monte Carlo (CEIMC). Using highly accurate quantum Monte\nCarlo methods for the electrons, we study the region of maximum compression\nalong the principal Hugoniot, where the system undergoes a continuous\ntransition from a molecular fluid to a monatomic fluid. We include all relevant\nphysical corrections so that a direct comparison to experiment can be made.\nAround 50 GPa we found a maximum compression of 4.85, roughly 10% larger than\nprevious theoretical predictions and experimental data but still compatible\nwith the latter because of their large uncertainty.\n", "  This paper summarizes the relevant theoretical developments, outlines some\nideas to improve experimental searches for free neutron-antineutron\noscillations, and suggests avenues for future improvement in the experimental\nsensitivity.\n", "  Starting from equations obeyed by functions involving the first or the second\nderivatives of the biconfluent Heun function, we construct two expansions of\nthe solutions of the biconfluent Heun equation in terms of incomplete Beta\nfunctions. The first series applies single Beta functions as expansion\nfunctions, while the second one involves a combination of two Beta functions.\nThe coefficients of expansions obey four- and five-term recurrence relations,\nrespectively. It is shown that the proposed technique is potent to produce\nseries solutions in terms of other special functions. Two examples of such\nexpansions in terms of the incomplete Gamma functions are presented\n", "  In our previous paper [Comm. Math. Phys. 330 (2014), 367-399] we described\nthe asymptotic behaviour of trajectories of the full symmetric\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_n$ Toda lattice in the case of distinct eigenvalues of the Lax\nmatrix. It turned out that it is completely determined by the Bruhat order on\nthe permutation group. In the present paper we extend this result to the case\nwhen some eigenvalues of the Lax matrix coincide. In that case the trajectories\nare described in terms of the projection to a partial flag space where the\ninduced dynamical system verifies the same properties as before: we show that\nwhen $t\\to\\pm\\infty$ the trajectories of the induced dynamical system converge\nto a finite set of points in the partial flag space indexed by the Schubert\ncells so that any two points of this set are connected by a trajectory if and\nonly if the corresponding cells are adjacent. This relation can be explained in\nterms of the Bruhat order on multiset permutations.\n", "  The connective constant $\\mu(G)$ of an infinite transitive graph $G$ is the\nexponential growth rate of the number of self-avoiding walks from a given\norigin. In earlier work of Grimmett and Li, a locality theorem was proved for\nconnective constants, namely, that the connective constants of two graphs are\nclose in value whenever the graphs agree on a large ball around the origin. A\ncondition of the theorem was that the graphs support so-called 'unimodular\ngraph height functions'. When the graphs are Cayley graphs of infinite,\nfinitely generated groups, there is a special type of unimodular graph height\nfunction termed here a 'group height function'. A necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the existence of a group height function is presented, and may be\napplied in the context of the bridge constant, and of the locality of\nconnective constants for Cayley graphs. Locality may thereby be established for\na variety of infinite groups including those with strictly positive deficiency.\n  It is proved that a large class of Cayley graphs support unimodular graph\nheight functions, that are in addition harmonic on the graph. This implies, for\nexample, the existence of unimodular graph height functions for the Cayley\ngraphs of finitely generated solvable groups. It turns out that graphs with\nnon-unimodular automorphism subgroups also possess graph height functions, but\nthe resulting graph height functions need not be harmonic.\n  Group height functions, as well as the graph height functions of the previous\nparagraph, are non-constant harmonic functions with linear growth and an\nadditional property of having periodic differences. The existence of such\nfunctions on Cayley graphs is a topic of interest beyond their applications in\nthe theory of self-avoiding walks.\n", "  We present a quantum password checking protocol where secrecy is protected by\nthe laws of quantum mechanics. The passwords are encoded in quantum systems\nthat can be compared but have a dimension too small to allow reading the\nencoded bits. We study the protocol under different replay attacks and show it\nis robust even for poorly chosen passwords.\n", "  The holographic mutual information for the small separation of two circles\nand two strips in 2+1 dimensional space-time is considered based on the known\nexact minimal surfaces spanning the boundaries on AdS4. The results suggest a\nuniversality for the leading term in the short-distance expansion of\nholographic mutual information. A conjecture for a similar result for d > 2 is\nalso presented, as well as comments about the analogous expansion in conformal\nfield theory.\n", "  The world formulation of the full theory of classical Proca fields in\ngenerally relativistic spacetimes is concisely reviewed and the entire set of\npertinent field equations is transcribed in a straightforward way into the\nframework of one of the Infeld-van der Waerden formalisms. Some well-known\ncalculational techniques are then utilized for deriving the wave equations that\ncontrol the propagation of the fields allowed for. It appears that no\ninteraction couplings between such fields and electromagnetic curvatures are\ncarried by the wave equations at issue. What results is, in effect, that the\nonly interactions which ultimately occur in the theoretical context under\nconsideration involve strictly Proca fields and wave functions for gravitons.\n", "  We study the potential energy surface of the ozone molecule by means of\nQuantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the resonating valence bond concept.\nThe trial wave function consists of an antisymmetrized geminal power arranged\nin a single-determinant that is multiplied by a Jastrow correlation factor.\nWhereas the determinantal part incorporates static correlation effects, the\naugmented real-space correlation factor accounts for the dynamics electron\ncorrelation. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated by computing the\npotential energy surface for the ozone molecule in three vibrational states:\nsymmetric, asymmetric and scissoring. We find that the employed wave function\nprovides a detailed description of rather strongly-correlated multi-reference\nsystems, which is in quantitative agreement with experiment.\n", "  We study integrable Euler equations on the Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{gl}(3,\\mathbb{R})$ by interpreting them as evolutions on the space\nof hexagons inscribed in a real cubic curve.\n", "  We obtain an essential spectral gap for $n$-dimensional convex co-compact\nhyperbolic manifolds with the dimension $\\delta$ of the limit set close to\n$(n-1)/2$. The size of the gap is expressed using the additive energy of\nstereographic projections of the limit set. This additive energy can in turn be\nestimated in terms of the constants in Ahlfors-David regularity of the limit\nset. Our proofs use new microlocal methods, in particular a notion of a fractal\nuncertainty principle.\n", "  We provide and analyze examples that counter the widely made claim that\ntunneling is needed for a quantum speedup in optimization problems. The\nexamples belong to the class of perturbed Hamming-weight optimization problems.\nIn one case, featuring a plateau in the cost function in Hamming weight space,\nwe find that the adiabatic dynamics that make tunneling possible, while\nsuperior to simulated annealing, result in a slowdown compared to a diabatic\ncascade of avoided level-crossings. This, in turn, inspires a classical spin\nvector dynamics algorithm that is at least as efficient for the plateau problem\nas the diabatic quantum algorithm. In a second case whose cost function is\nconvex in Hamming weight space, the diabatic cascade results in a speedup\nrelative to both tunneling and classical spin vector dynamics.\n", "  Trajectories provide dynamical information that is discarded in free energy\ncalculations, for which we sought to design a scheme with the hope of saving\ncost for generating dynamical information. We first demonstrated that snapshots\nin a converged trajectory set are associated with implicit conformers that have\ninvariant statistical weight distribution (ISWD). Based on the thought that\ninfinite number of sets of implicit conformers with ISWD may be created through\nindependent converged trajectory sets, we hypothesized that explicit conformers\nwith ISWD may be constructed for complex molecular systems through systematic\nincrease of conformer fineness, and tested the hypothesis in lipid molecule\npalmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC). Furthermore, when explicit\nconformers with ISWD were utilized as basic states to define conformational\nentropy, change of which between two given macrostates was found to be\nequivalent to change of free energy except a mere difference of a negative\ntemperature factor, and change of enthalpy essentially cancels corresponding\nchange of average intra-conformer entropy. These findings suggest that entropy\nenthalpy compensation is inherently a local phenomenon in configurational\nspace. By implicitly taking advantage of entropy enthalpy compensation and\nforgoing all dynamical information, constructing explicit conformers with ISWD\nand counting thermally accessible number of which for interested end\nmacrostates is likely to be an efficient and reliable alternative end point\nfree energy calculation strategy.\n", "  An on-demand single photon source is a key element in a series of prospective\nquantum technologies and applications. We demonstrate the operation of a\ntuneable on-demand microwave photon source based on a fully controllable\nsuperconducting artificial atom strongly coupled to an open-end transmission\nline (a 1D half-space). The atom emits a photon upon excitation by a short\nmicrowave $\\pi$-pulse applied through a control line weakly coupled to the\natom. The emission and control lines are well decoupled from each other,\npreventing the direct leakage of radiation from the $\\pi$-pulses used for\nexcitation. The estimated efficiency of the source is higher than 75\\% and\nremains to be about 50\\% or higher over a wide frequency range from 6.7 to 9.1\nGHz continuously tuned by an external magnetic field.\n", "  We introduce a definition of symmetry generating vector fields on manifolds\nwhich are equipped with a first-order reductive Cartan geometry. We apply this\ndefinition to a number of physically motivated examples and show that our newly\nintroduced notion of symmetry agrees with the usual notions of symmetry of\naffine, Riemann-Cartan, Riemannian and Weizenb\\\"ock geometries, which are\nconventionally used as spacetime models. Further, we discuss the case of Cartan\ngeometries which can be used to model observer space instead of spacetime. We\nshow which vector fields on an observer space can be interpreted as symmetry\ngenerators of an underlying spacetime manifold, and may hence be called\n\"spatio-temporal\". We finally apply this construction to Finsler spacetimes and\nshow that symmetry generating vector fields on a Finsler spacetime are indeed\nin a one-to-one correspondence with spatio-temporal vector fields on its\nobserver space.\n", "  We present a systematic and comprehensive study of finite-size effects in\ndiffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations of metals. Several previously\nintroduced schemes for correcting finite-size errors are compared for accuracy\nand efficiency and practical improvements are introduced. In particular, we\ntest a simple but efficient method of finite-size correction based on an\naccurate combination of twist averaging and density functional theory. Our\ndiffusion quantum Monte Carlo results for lithium and aluminum, as examples of\nmetallic systems, demonstrate excellent agreement between all of the approaches\nconsidered.\n", "  We report the in-plane and out-of-plane heat conductivity of the\nantiferromagnetic spin-orbit induced Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ with\n$J_\\mathrm{eff} = 1/2$. Our data reveal clear-cut evidence for magnetic heat\ntransport within the IrO$_2$ planes which provides the unique possibility to\nanalyze the thermal occupation and scattering of $J_\\mathrm{eff} = 1/2$\npseudospin excitations. The analysis of the magnetic heat conductivity yields a\nlow-temperature ($T \\lesssim 75$ K) magnetic mean free path $l_\\mathrm{mag}\n\\sim 32$ nm, consistent with boundary scattering. Upon heating towards room\ntemperature, the mean free path strongly decreases by one order of magnitude\ndue to thermally activated scattering of the pseudospin excitations. The latter\nreveals that the coupling of these excitations to the lattice is radically\ndifferent from that of $S = 1/2$-excitations in cuprate analogs.\n", "  With recent developments in simulating nonadiabatic systems to high accuracy,\nit has become possible to determine how much energy is attributed to nuclear\nquantum effects beyond zero-point energy. In this work we calculate the\nnon-relativistic ground-state energies of atomic and molecular systems without\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approximation. For this purpose we utilize the fixed-node\ndiffusion Monte Carlo method, in which the nodes depend on both the electronic\nand ionic positions. We report ground-state energies for all systems studied,\nionization energies for the first-row atoms and atomization energies for the\nfirst-row hydrides. We find the ionization energies of the atoms to be nearly\nindependent of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, within the accuracy of our\nresults. The atomization energies of molecular systems, however, show small\neffects of the nonadiabatic coupling between electrons and nuclei.\n", "  Janus colloids propelled by light, e.g., thermophoretic particles, offer\npromising prospects as artificial microswimmers. However, their swimming\nbehavior and its dependence on fluid properties and fluid-colloid interactions\nremain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the behavior of a thermophoretic\nJanus colloid in its own temperature gradient using numerical simulations. The\ndissipative particle dynamics method with energy conservation is used to\ninvestigate the behavior in non-ideal and ideal-gas like fluids for different\nfluid-colloid interactions, boundary conditions, and temperature-controlling\nstrategies. The fluid-colloid interactions appear to have a strong effect on\nthe colloid behavior, since they directly affect heat exchange between the\ncolloid surface and the fluid. The simulation results show that a reduction of\nthe heat exchange at the fluid-colloid interface leads to an enhancement of\ncolloid's thermophoretic mobility. The colloid behavior is found to be\ndifferent in non-ideal and ideal fluids, suggesting that fluid compressibility\nplays a significant role. The flow field around the colloid surface is found to\nbe dominated by a source-dipole, in agreement with the recent theoretical and\nsimulation predictions. Finally, different temperature-control strategies do\nnot appear to have a strong effect on the colloid's swimming velocity.\n", "  The swimming properties of an E. coli-type model bacterium are investigated\nby mesoscale hy- drodynamic simulations, combining molecular dynamics\nsimulations of the bacterium with the multiparticle particle collision dynamics\nmethod for the embedding fluid. The bacterium is com- posed of a\nspherocylindrical body with attached helical flagella, built up from discrete\nparticles for an efficient coupling with the fluid. We measure the hydrodynamic\nfriction coefficients of the bacterium and find quantitative agreement with\nexperimental results of swimming E. coli. The flow field of the bacterium shows\na force-dipole-like pattern in the swimming plane and two vor- tices\nperpendicular to its swimming direction arising from counterrotation of the\ncell body and the flagella. By comparison with the flow field of a force dipole\nand rotlet dipole, we extract the force- dipole and rotlet-dipole strengths for\nthe bacterium and find that counterrotation of the cell body and the flagella\nis essential for describing the near-field hydrodynamics of the bacterium.\n", "  Worm-like filaments that are propelled homogeneously along their tangent\nvector are studied by Brownian dynamics simulations. Systems in two dimensions\nare investigated, corresponding to filaments adsorbed to interfaces or\nsurfaces. A large parameter space covering weak and strong propulsion, as well\nas flexible and stiff filaments is explored. For strongly propelled and\nflexible filaments, the free-swimming filaments spontaneously form stable\nspirals. The propulsion force has a strong impact on dynamic properties, such\nas the rotational and translational mean square displacement and the rate of\nconformational sampling. In particular, when the active self-propulsion\ndominates thermal diffusion, but is too weak for spiral formation, the\nrotational diffusion coefficient has an activity-induced contribution given by\n$v_c/\\xi_P$, where $v_c$ is the contour velocity and $\\xi_P$ the persistence\nlength. In contrast, structural properties are hardly affected by the activity\nof the system, as long as no spirals form. The model mimics common features of\nbiological systems, such as microtubules and actin filaments on motility assays\nor slender bacteria, and artificially designed microswimmers.\n", "  The conformations and dynamics of semiflexible filaments subject to a\nhomogeneous external (gravitational) field, e.g., in a centrifuge, are studied\nnumerically and analytically. The competition between hydrodynamic drag and\nbending elasticity generates new shapes and dynamical features. We show that\nthe shape of a semiflexible filament undergoes instabilities as the external\nfield increases. We identify two transitions that correspond to the excitation\nof higher bending modes. In particular, for strong fields the filament\nstabilizes in a non-planar shape, resulting in a sideways drift or in helical\ntrajectories. For two interacting filaments, we find the same transitions, with\nthe important consequence that the new non-planar shapes have an effective\nhydrodynamic repulsion, in contrast to the planar shapes which attract\nthemselves even when their osculating planes are rotated with respect to each\nother. For the case of planar filaments, we show analytically and numerically\nthat the relative velocity is not necessarily due to a different drag of the\nindividual filaments, but to the hydrodynamic interactions induced by their\nshape asymmetry.\n", "  Clean and interacting periodically driven quantum systems are believed to\nexhibit a single, trivial \"infinite-temperature\" Floquet-ergodic phase. In\ncontrast, here we show that their disordered Floquet many-body localized\ncounterparts can exhibit distinct ordered phases delineated by sharp\ntransitions. Some of these are analogs of equilibrium states with broken\nsymmetries and topological order, while others - genuinely new to the Floquet\nproblem - are characterized by order and non-trivial periodic dynamics. We\nillustrate these ideas in driven spin chains with Ising symmetry.\n", "  We study the evolution of the quantum state of $n$ photons in $m$ different\nmodes when they go through a lossless linear optical system. We show that there\nare quantum evolution operators $U$ that cannot be built with linear optics\nalone unless the number of photons or the number of modes is equal to one. The\nevolution for single photons can be controlled with the known realization of\nany unitary proved by Reck, Zeilinger, Bernstein and Bertani. The evolution for\na single mode corresponds to the trivial evolution in a phase shifter. We\nanalyze these two cases and prove that any other combination of the number of\nphotons and modes produces a Hilbert state too big for the linear optics system\nto give any desired evolution.\n", "  The eigenstates of many-body localized (MBL) Hamiltonians exhibit low\nentanglement. We adapt the highly successful density-matrix renormalization\ngroup method, which is usually used to find modestly entangled ground states of\nlocal Hamiltonians, to find individual highly excited eigenstates of many body\nlocalized Hamiltonians. The adaptation builds on the distinctive spatial\nstructure of such eigenstates. We benchmark our method against the well studied\nrandom field Heisenberg model in one dimension. At moderate to large disorder,\nwe find that the method successfully obtains excited eigenstates with high\naccuracy, thereby enabling a study of MBL systems at much larger system sizes\nthan those accessible to exact-diagonalization methods.\n", "  We investigate closed, symmetric $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$-realizations $H$ of\nSchr\\\"odinger-type operators $(- \\Delta\n+V)\\upharpoonright_{C_0^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\Sigma)}$ whose\npotential coefficient $V$ has a countable number of well-separated\nsingularities on compact sets $\\Sigma_j$, $j \\in J$, of $n$-dimensional\nLebesgue measure zero, with $J \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ an index set and $\\Sigma =\n\\bigcup_{j \\in J} \\Sigma_j$. We show that the defect, $\\mathrm{def}(H)$, of $H$\ncan be computed in terms of the individual defects, $\\mathrm{def}(H_j)$, of\nclosed, symmetric $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$-realizations of $(- \\Delta +\nV_j)\\upharpoonright_{C_0^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus \\Sigma_j)}$ with\npotential coefficient $V_j$ localized around the singularity $\\Sigma_j$, $j \\in\nJ$, where $V = \\sum_{j \\in J} V_j$. In particular, we prove \\[ \\mathrm{def}(H)\n= \\sum_{j \\in J} \\mathrm{def}(H_j), \\] including the possibility that one, and\nhence both sides equal $\\infty$. We first develop an abstract approach to the\nquestion of decoupling of deficiency indices and then apply it to the concrete\ncase of Schr\\\"odinger-type operators in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n  Moreover, we also show how operator (and form) bounds for $V$ relative to\n$H_0= - \\Delta\\upharpoonright_{H^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)}$ can be estimated in terms of\nthe operator (and form) bounds of $V_j$, $j \\in J$, relative to $H_0$. Again,\nwe first prove an abstract result and then show its applicability to\nSchr\\\"odinger-type operators in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n  Extensions to second-order (locally uniformly) elliptic differential\noperators on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with a possibly strongly singular potential\ncoefficient are treated as well.\n", "  We study an experimental system of hard granular squares in two dimensions,\nenergized by vibration. The interplay of order in the orientations and\npositions of anisotropic particles allows for a rich set of phases. We measure\nthe structure and dynamics of steady states as a function of particle density.\nThis allows us to identify a progression of phases in which a low density\nisotropic fluid gives way to a phase with tetratic orientational order,\nshort-range translational correlations, and slowed rotational dynamics. In this\nrange of density we also observe a coupling between the molecular orientational\norder and bond-orientational order. At higher densities, the particles freeze\ninto a translationally and orientationally ordered square crystalline phase in\nwhich translational diffusion is suppressed.\n", "  We demonstrate that the phenomenon of current confinement along graphene n-p\njunctions at high magnetic fields can be used to form an Aharonov-Bohm\ninterferometer. The interference system exploits a closed n-p junction that can\nbe induced by a floating gate within the sample, and coupling of the junction\ncurrents with the edge currents in the quantum Hall regime. Operation of the\ndevice requires current splitting at the edge and the n-p junction contacts\nwhich is found for armchair ribbons at low Fermi energy.\n", "  In general-relativistic perturbation theory, a point mass accelerates away\nfrom geodesic motion due to its gravitational self-force. Because the\nself-force is small, one can often approximate the motion as geodesic. However,\nit is well known that self-force effects accumulate over time, making the\ngeodesic approximation fail on long timescales. It is less well known that this\nfailure at large times translates to a failure at large distances as well. At\nsecond perturbative order, two large-distance pathologies arise: spurious\nsecular growth and infrared-divergent retarded integrals. Both stand in the way\nof practical computations of second-order self-force effects.\n  Utilizing a simple flat-space scalar toy model, I develop methods to overcome\nthese obstacles. The secular growth is tamed with a multiscale expansion that\ncaptures the system's slow evolution. The divergent integrals are eliminated by\nmatching to the correct retarded solution at large distances. I also show how\nto extract conservative self-force effects by taking local-in-time \"snapshots\"\nof the global solution. These methods are readily adaptable to the physically\nrelevant case of a point mass orbiting a black hole.\n", "  Using the largest spectroscopic dataset of stripped-envelope core-collapse\nsupernovae (stripped SNe), we present a systematic investigation of spectral\nproperties of Type IIb SNe (SNe IIb), Type Ib SNe (SNe Ib), and Type Ic SNe\n(SNe Ic). Prior studies have been based on individual objects or small samples.\nHere, we analyze 227 spectra of 14 SNe IIb, 258 spectra of 21 SNe Ib, and 207\nspectra of 17 SNe Ic based on the stripped SN dataset of Modjaz et al. (2014)\nand other published spectra of individual SNe. Each SN in our sample has a\nsecure spectroscopic ID, a date of $V$-band maximum light, and multiple spectra\nat different phases. We analyze these spectra as a function of subtype and\nphase in order to improve the SN identification scheme and constrain the\nprogenitors of different kinds of stripped SNe. By comparing spectra of SNe IIb\nwith those of SNe Ib, we find that the strength of H$\\alpha$ can be used to\nquantitatively differentiate between these two subtypes at all epochs.\nMoreover, we find a continuum in observational properties between SNe IIb and\nIb. We address the question of hidden He in SNe Ic by comparing our\nobservations with predictions from various models that either include hidden He\nor in which He has been burnt. Our results favor the He-free progenitor models\nfor SNe Ic. Finally, we construct continuum-divided average spectra as a\nfunction of subtype and phase to quantify the spectral diversity of the\ndifferent types of stripped SNe.\n", "  The extragalactic background light (EBL) is comprised of the cumulative\nradiation from all galaxies and active galactic nuclei over the cosmic history.\nIn addition to point sources, EBL also contains information from diffuse\nsources of radiation. The angular power spectra of the near-infrared\nintensities could contain additional signals and a complete understanding of\nthe nature of the IR background is still lacking in the literature. Here we\nexplore the constraints that can be placed on particle decays, especially\ncandidate dark matter models involving axions that trace dark matter halos of\ngalaxies. Axions with a mass around a few eV will decay via two photons with\nwavelengths in the near-IR band, and will leave a signature in the IR\nbackground intensity power spectrum. Using recent power spectra measurements\nfrom the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment\n(CIBER), we find that the 0.6 to 1.6 micron power spectra can be explained by\naxions with masses around 4 eV. The total axion abundance Omega_a~0.05, and it\nis comparable to the baryon density of the Universe. The suggested mean axion\nmass and abundance are not ruled out by existing cosmological observations.\nInterestingly, the axion model with a mass distribution is preferred by the\ndata, which cannot be explained by the standard quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\ntheory and needs further discussion.\n", "  In the light of recent experimental results on $\\theta_{13}^{pmns}$, we\nre-investigate the complementarity between the quark and lepton mixing matrices\nand obtain predictions for most unsettled neutrino mixing parameters like\n$\\theta_{23}^{pmns}$ and CP violating phase invariants $J$, $S_1$ and $S_2$.\nThis paper is motivated by our previous work where in a QLC model we predicted\nthe value for $\\theta_{13}^{pmns}=(9{^{+1}_{-2}})^\\circ$, which was found to be\nin strong agreement with the experimental results. In the QLC model the\nnon-trivial correlation between CKM and PMNS mixing matrices is given by a\ncorrelation matrix ($V_{c}$). We do numerical simulation and estimate the\ntexture of the $V_{c}$ and in our findings we get a small deviation from the\nTri-Bi-Maximal (TBM) texture and a large from the Bi-Maximal one, which is\nconsistent with the work already reported in literature. In the further\ninvestigation we obtain quite constrained limits for\n$sin^2{\\theta_{23}^{pmns}}= 0.4235_{-0.0043}^{+0.0032}$ that is narrower to the\nexisting ones. We also obtain the constrained limits for the three CP violating\nphase invariants $J$, $S_1$ and $S_2$: as $J < 0.0315$, $S_{1} <0.12$ and\n$S_{2} <0.08$, respectively.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of fermions are hampered by the notorious\nsign problem whose most striking manifestation is an exponential growth of\nsampling errors with the number of particles. With the sign problem known to be\nan NP-hard problem and any generic solution thus highly elusive, the Monte\nCarlo sampling of interacting many-fermion systems is commonly thought to be\nrestricted to a small class of model systems for which a sign-free basis has\nbeen identified. Here we demonstrate that entanglement measures, in particular\nthe so-called Renyi entropies, can intrinsically exhibit a certain robustness\nagainst the sign problem in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo approaches and\npossibly allow for the identification of global ground-state properties via\ntheir scaling behavior even in the presence of a strong sign problem. We\ncorroborate these findings via numerical simulations of fermionic quantum phase\ntransitions of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice at and below\nhalf-filling.\n", "  Motivation: DNA data is transcribed into single-stranded RNA, which folds\ninto specific molecular structures. In this paper we pose the question to what\nextent sequence- and structure-information correlate. We view this correlation\nas structural semantics of sequence data that allows for a different\ninterpretation than conventional sequence alignment. Structural semantics could\nenable us to identify more general embedded \"patterns\" in DNA and RNA\nsequences. Results: We compute the partition function of sequences with respect\nto a fixed structure and connect this computation to the mutual information of\na sequence-structure pair for RNA secondary structures. We present a Boltzmann\nsampler and obtain the a priori probability of specific sequence patterns. We\npresent a detailed analysis for the three PDB-structures, 2JXV (hairpin), 2N3R\n(3-branch multi-loop) and 1EHZ (tRNA). We localize specific sequence patterns,\ncontrast the energy spectrum of the Boltzmann sampled sequences versus those\nsequences that refold into the same structure and derive a criterion to\nidentify native structures. We illustrate that there are multiple sequences in\nthe partition function of a fixed structure, each having nearly the same mutual\ninformation, that are nevertheless poorly aligned. This indicates the\npossibility of the existence of relevant patterns embedded in the sequences\nthat are not discoverable using alignments.\n", "  We present a robust tight-binding description, based on the Slater-Koster\nformalism, of the band structure of H$_3$S in the {\\em Im}$\\bar{3}${\\em m}\nstructure, stable in the range of pressure $P = 180-220$ GPa. We show that the\ninteratomic hopping between the 3$s$ and 3$p$ orbitals (and partially between\nthe 3$p$ orbitals themselves) of sulphur is fundamental to capture the relevant\nphysics associated with the Van Hove singularities close to the Fermi level.\nComparing the model so defined with density functional theory calculations we\nobtain a very good agreement not only of the overall band-structure, but also\nof the low-energy states and of the Fermi surface properties. The description\nin terms of Slater-Koster parameters permits us also to evaluate at a\nmicroscopic level a hopping-resolved linear electron-lattice coupling which can\nbe employed for further tight-binding analyses also at a local scale.\n", "  We investigate the continuous quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit\nundergoing fluorescence. The fluorescence of the qubit is detected via a\nphase-preserving heterodyne measurement, giving the fluorescence quadrature\nsignals as two continuous qubit readout results. By using the stochastic path\nintegral approach to the measurement physics, we derive most likely paths\nbetween boundary conditions on the state, and compute approximate time\ncorrelation functions between all stochastic variables via diagrammatic\nperturbation theory. We focus on paths that increase in energy during the\ncontinuous measurement. Our results are compared to Monte Carlo numerical\nsimulation of the trajectories, and we find close agreement between direct\nsimulation and theory. We generalize this analysis to arbitrary diffusive\nquantum systems that are continuously monitored.\n", "  The Coulombic quantum spin liquid in quantum spin ice is an exotic quantum\nphase of matter that emerges on the pyrochlore lattice and is currently\nactively searched for. Motivated by recent experiments on the Yb-based\nbreathing pyrochlore material Ba$_3$Yb$_2$Zn$_5$O$_{11}$, we theoretically\nstudy the phase diagram and magnetic properties of the relevant spin model. The\nlatter takes the form of a quantum spin ice Hamiltonian on a breathing\npyrochlore lattice, and we analyze the stability of the quantum spin liquid\nphase in the absence of the inversion symmetry which the lattice breaks\nexplicitly at lattice sites. Using a gauge mean-field approach, we show that\nthe quantum spin liquid occupies a finite region in parameter space. Moreover,\nthere exists a direct quantum phase transition between the quantum spin liquid\nphase and featureless paramagnets, even though none of theses phases break any\nsymmetry. At nonzero temperature, we show that breathing pyrochlores provide a\nmuch broader finite temperature spin liquid regime than their regular\ncounterparts. We discuss the implications of the results for current\nexperiments and make predictions for future experiments on breathing\npyrochlores.\n", "  Objects are represented in sensory systems by continuous manifolds due to\nsensitivity of neuronal responses to changes in physical features such as\nlocation, orientation, and intensity. What makes certain sensory\nrepresentations better suited for invariant decoding of objects by downstream\nnetworks? We present a theory that characterizes the ability of a linear\nreadout network, the perceptron, to classify objects from variable neural\nresponses. We show how the readout perceptron capacity depends on the\ndimensionality, size, and shape of the object manifolds in its input neural\nrepresentation.\n", "  For numerical simulations of cosmic-ray propagation fast access to static\nmagnetic field data is required. We present a data structure for\nmultiresolution vector grids which is optimized for fast access, low overhead\nand shared memory use. The hierarchy information is encoded into the grid\nitself, reducing the memory overhead. Benchmarks show that in certain scenarios\nthe differences in deflections introduced by sampling the magnetic field model\ncan be significantly reduced when using the multiresolution approach.\n", "  We investigated the 238U(d,p) reaction as a surrogate for the n + 238U\nreaction. For this purpose we measured for the first time the gamma-decay and\nfission probabilities of 239U* simultaneously and compared them to the\ncorresponding neutron-induced data. We present the details of the procedure to\ninfer the decay probabilities, as well as a thorough uncertainty analysis,\nincluding parameter correlations. Calculations based on the\ncontinuum-discretized coupled-channels and distorted-wave Born approximations\nwere used to correct our data from detected protons originating from elastic\nand inelastic deuteron breakup. In the region where the fission and gamma-decay\nprobabilities compete, the corrected fission probability is in agreement with\nneutron-induced data, whereas the gamma-decay probability is much higher than\nthe neutron-induced data. The performed statistical-model calculations are not\nable to explain these results.\n", "  We present an analysis of the decay $D^{+} \\to K^{-} \\pi^+ e^+ \\nu_e$ based\non data collected by the BESIII experiment at the $\\psi(3770)$ resonance. Using\na nearly background-free sample of 18262 events, we measure the branching\nfraction $\\mathcal{B}(D^{+} \\to K^{-} \\pi^+ e^+ \\nu_e) = (3.71 \\pm 0.03 \\pm\n0.08)\\%$. For $0.8<m_{K\\pi}<1.0$ GeV/$c^{2}$ the partial branching fraction is\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^{+} \\to K^{-} \\pi^+ e^+ \\nu_e)_{[0.8,1]} = (3.33 \\pm 0.03 \\pm\n0.07)\\%$. A partial wave analysis shows that the dominant $\\bar K^{*}(892)^{0}$\ncomponent is accompanied by an \\emph{S}-wave contribution accounting for\n$(6.05\\pm0.22\\pm0.18)\\%$ of the total rate and that other components are\nnegligible. The parameters of the $\\bar K^{*}(892)^{0}$ resonance and of the\nform factors based on the spectroscopic pole dominance predictions are also\nmeasured. We also present a measurement of the $\\bar K^{*}(892)^{0}$ helicity\nbasis form factors in a model-independent way.\n", "  We present high-contrast H-band polarized intensity images of the\ntransitional disk around the young solar-like star LkCa 15. By utilizing\nSubaru/HiCIAO for polarimetric differential imaging, both the angular\nresolution and the inner working angle reach 0.07\" and r=0.1\", respectively. We\nobtained a clearly resolved gap (width <~ 27 AU) at ~ 48 AU from the central\nstar. This gap is consistent with images reported in previous studies. We also\nconfirmed the existence of a bright inner disk with a misaligned position angle\nof 13+/-4 degree with respect to that of the outer disk, i.e., the inner disk\nis possibly warped. The large gap and the warped inner disk both point to the\nexistence of a multiple planetary system with a mass of <~1Mjup.\n", "  Pairing gaps in neutron matter need to be computed in a wide range of\ndensities to address open questions in neutron star phenomenology.\nTraditionally, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer approach has been used to compute\ngaps from bare nucleon-nucleon interactions. Here, we incorporate the influence\nof short- and long-range correlations in the pairing gaps. Short-range\ncorrelations are treated including the appropriate fragmentation of\nsingle-particle states, and substantially suppress the gaps. Long-range\ncorrelations dress the pairing interaction via density and spin modes, and\nprovide a relatively small correction. We use different interactions, some with\nthree-body forces, as a starting point to control for any systematic effects.\nResults are relevant for neutron-star cooling scenarios, in particular in view\nof the recent observational data on Cassiopeia A.\n", "  Complex behaviour in many systems arises from the stochastic interactions of\nspatially distributed particles or agents. Stochastic reaction-diffusion\nprocesses are widely used to model such behaviour in disciplines ranging from\nbiology to the social sciences, yet they are notoriously difficult to simulate\nand calibrate to observational data. Here we use ideas from statistical physics\nand machine learning to provide a solution to the inverse problem of learning a\nstochastic reaction-diffusion process from data. Our solution relies on a\nnon-trivial connection between stochastic reaction-diffusion processes and\nspatio-temporal Cox processes, a well-studied class of models from\ncomputational statistics. This connection leads to an efficient and flexible\nalgorithm for parameter inference and model selection. Our approach shows\nexcellent accuracy on numeric and real data examples from systems biology and\nepidemiology. Our work provides both insights into spatio-temporal stochastic\nsystems, and a practical solution to a long-standing problem in computational\nmodelling.\n", "  We present a ray tracing code to compute integrated cosmological observables\non the fly in AMR N-body simulations. Unlike conventional ray tracing\ntechniques, our code takes full advantage of the time and spatial resolution\nattained by the N-body simulation by computing the integrals along the line of\nsight on a cell-by-cell basis through the AMR simulation grid. Moroever, since\nit runs on the fly in the N-body run, our code can produce maps of the desired\nobservables without storing large (or any) amounts of data for post-processing.\nWe implemented our routines in the RAMSES N-body code and tested the\nimplementation using an example of weak lensing simulation. We analyse basic\nstatistics of lensing convergence maps and find good agreement with\nsemi-analytical methods. The ray tracing methodology presented here can be used\nin several cosmological analysis such as Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and integrated\nSachs-Wolfe effect studies as well as modified gravity. Our code can also be\nused in cross-checks of the more conventional methods, which can be important\nin tests of theory systematics in preparation for upcoming large scale\nstructure surveys.\n", "  The Hawking radiation is considered as a quantum tunneling process, which can\nbe studied in the framework of the Hamilton-Jacobi method. In this study, we\npresent the wave equation for a mass generating massive and charged scalar\nparticle (boson). In sequel, we analyze the quantum tunneling of these bosons\nfrom a generic 4-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole. We apply the\nHamilton-Jacobi formalism to derive the radial integral solution for the\nclassically forbidden action which leads to the tunneling probability. To\nsupport our arguments, we take the dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole as\na test background. Comparing the tunneling probability obtained with the\nBoltzmann formula, we succeed to read the standard Hawking temperature of the\ndyonic Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole.\n", "  We analyze third-harmonic generation from high-index dielectric nanoparticles\nand discuss the basic features and multipolar nature of the parametrically\ngenerated electromagnetic fields near the Mie-type optical resonances. By\ncombining both analytical and numerical methods, we study the nonlinear\nscattering from simple nanoparticle geometries such as spheres and disks in the\nvicinity of the magnetic dipole resonance. We reveal the approaches for\nmanipulating and directing the resonantly enhanced nonlinear emission with\nsubwavelength all-dielectric structures that can be of a particular interest\nfor novel designs of nonlinear optical antennas and engineering the magnetic\noptical nonlinear response at nanoscale.\n", "  We consider mixed strongly gravitating configurations consisting of a\nwormhole threaded by two types of ordinary matter. For such systems, the\npossibility of obtaining static spherically symmetric solutions describing\ncompact massive central objects enclosed by high-redshift surfaces\n(black-hole-like configurations) is studied. Using the standard thin accretion\ndisk model, we exhibit potentially observable differences allowing to\ndistinguish the mixed systems from ordinary black holes with the same masses.\n", "  Optical conductivity of graphene is studied using Quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations. We start from Euclidean current-current correlator and extract\n$\\sigma (\\omega)$ from Green-Kubo relations using Backus-Gilbert method.\nCalculations were performed both for long-range interactions and taking into\naccount only contact term. In both cases we vary interaction strength and study\nits influence on optical conductivity. We compare our results with previous\ntheoretical calculations choosing $\\omega \\approx \\kappa$ thus working in the\nregion of the plateau in $\\sigma(\\omega)$ which corresponds to optical\nconductivity of Dirac quasiparticles. No dependence of optical conductivity on\ninteraction strength is observed unless we approach antiferromagnetic phase\ntransition in case of artificially enhanced contact term. Our results strongly\nsupport previous theoretical studies claimed very weak regularization of\ngraphene conductivity.\n", "  The gravitational-wave signal GW150914 was first identified on Sept 14 2015\nby searches for short-duration gravitational-wave transients. These searches\nidentify time-correlated transients in multiple detectors with minimal\nassumptions aboutthe signal morphology, allowing them to be sensitive to\ngravitational waves emitted by a wide range of sources including binary\nblack-hole mergers. Over the observational period from September 12th to\nOctober 20th 2015, these transient searches were sensitive to binary black-hole\nmergers similar to GW150914 to an average distance of $\\sim 600$ Mpc. In this\npaper, we describe the analyses that first detected GW150914 as well as the\nparameter estimation and waveform reconstruction techniques that initially\nidentified GW150914 as the merger of two black holes. We find that the\nreconstructed waveform is consistent with the signal from a binary black-hole\nmerger with a chirp mass of $\\sim 30 \\, M_\\odot$ and a total mass before merger\nof $\\sim 70 \\, M_\\odot$ in the detector frame.\n", "  Quantum communication demands efficient distribution of quantum entanglement\nacross a network of connected partners. The search for efficient strategies for\nthe entanglement distribution may be based on percolation theory, which\ndescribes evolution of network connectivity with respect to some network\nparameters. In this framework, the probability to establish perfect\nentanglement between two remote partners decays exponentially with the distance\nbetween them before the percolation transition point, which unambiguously\ndefines percolation properties of any classical network or lattice. Here we\nintroduce quantum networks created with local operations and classical\ncommunication, which exhibit non-classical percolation transition points\nleading to the striking communication advantages over those offered by the\ncorresponding classical networks. We show, in particular, how to establish\nperfect entanglement between any two nodes in the simplest possible network --\nthe 1D chain -- using imperfect entangled pairs of qubits.\n", "  Ultracold atoms are an ideal platform to study strongly correlated phases of\nmatter in and out of equilibrium. Much of the experimental progress in this\nfield crucially relies on the control of the contact interaction between two\natoms. Control of strong long-range interactions between distant ground state\natoms has remained a long standing goal, opening the path towards the study of\nfundamentally new quantum many-body systems including frustrated or topological\nmagnets and supersolids. Optical dressing of ground state atoms by\nnear-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile\nmethod to engineer such interactions. However, up to now the great potential of\nthis approach for interaction control in a many-body setting has eluded\nexperimental confirmation. Here we report the realisation of coherent\nRydberg-dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the\ninduced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single\natom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic\nspin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy\nof the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable\nagreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further\nevidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems.\nFinally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible\nroutes to overcome this current limitation of coherence times. Our work marks\nthe first step towards the use of laser-controlled Rydberg interactions for the\nstudy of exotic quantum magnets in optical lattices.\n", "  We study the correlations between the maxima $m$ and $M$ of a Brownian motion\n(BM) on the time intervals $[0,t_1]$ and $[0,t_2]$, with $t_2>t_1$. We\ndetermine exact forms of the distribution functions $P(m,M)$ and $P(G = M -\nm)$, and calculate the moments $\\mathbb{E}\\{\\left(M - m\\right)^k\\}$ and the\ncross-moments $\\mathbb{E}\\{m^l M^k\\}$ with arbitrary integers $l$ and $k$. We\nshow that correlations between $m$ and $M$ decay as $\\sqrt{t_1/t_2}$ when\n$t_2/t_1 \\to \\infty$, revealing strong memory effects in the statistics of the\nBM maxima. We also compute the Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho(m,M)$, the\npower spectrum of $M_t$, and we discuss a possibility of extracting the\nensemble-averaged diffusion coefficient in single-trajectory experiments using\na single realization of the maximum process.\n", "  Free energy is arguably the most importance function(al) for understanding of\nmolecular systems. A number of rigorous and approximate free energy\ncalculation/estimation methods have been developed over many decades. One\nimportant issue, the continuity of an interested macrostate (or path) in\nconfigurational space, has not been well articulated, however. As a matter of\nfact, some important special cases have been intensively discussed. In this\nperspective, I discuss the relevance of configurational space continuity in\ndevelopment of more efficient and reliable next generation free energy\nmethodologies.\n", "  We review the application of lattice QCD techniques, most notably the Hybrid\nMonte-Carlo (HMC) simulations, to first-principle study of tight-binding models\nof crystalline solids with strong inter-electron interactions. After providing\na basic introduction into the HMC algorithm as applied to condensed matter\nsystems, we review HMC simulations of graphene, which in the recent years have\nhelped to understand the semi-metal behavior of clean suspended graphene at the\nquantitative level. We also briefly summarize other novel physical results\nobtained in these simulations. Then we comment on the applicability of Hybrid\nMonte-Carlo to topological insulators and Dirac and Weyl semi-metals and\nhighlight some of the relevant open physical problems. Finally, we also touch\nupon the lattice strong-coupling expansion technique as applied to condensed\nmatter systems.\n", "  One of the hallmarks of Weyl semi-metals is the existence of unusual\ntopological surface states known as 'Fermi arcs' [1-3]. The formation of these\nstates is guaranteed by the existence of bulk Weyl points with opposite\nchirality. Tantalum Arsenide (TaAs) [4-9], a member of the newly discovered\nfamily of Weyl semi-metals [4,5], harbors a host of non-topological ('trivial')\nsurface states overlapping in energy with the predicted 12 'Fermi arcs'. This\noverlap poses a major challenge in identifying the signatures of the arcs [10].\nHere we harness the inherently distinct spatial structure of trivial and Fermi\narc states to visualize the Fermi arcs for the first time using scanning\ntunneling microscopy. We do so in four distinct ways, each of which highlights\na different aspect of their unusual nature. We reveal their relatively\nisotropic scattering signature, their energy dispersion and its relation to the\nbulk Weyl points, their deep bulk penetration relative to that of\nnon-topological surface states and their weak coupling to the atomic structure.\nThe latter is obtained by accounting for the spatial structure of the Bloch\nwavefunction and its effect on the scattering properties of the electrons off\nlattice defects in general. It thus provides a novel analysis tool for the\nspectroscopic characterization of electronic wavefunctions using scanning\ntunneling microscopy.\n", "  We study, in theory and experiment, the quantum properties of correlated\nlight fields measured with click-counting detectors providing incomplete\ninformation on the photon statistics. We establish a correlation parameter for\nthe conditional statistics, and we derive the corresponding nonclassicality\ncriteria for detecting conditional quantum correlations. Classical bounds for\nPearson's correlation parameter are formulated that allow us, once they are\nviolated, to determine nonclassical correlations via the joint statistics. On\nthe one hand, we demonstrate nonclassical correlations in terms of the joint\nclick statistics of light produced by a parametric down conversion source. On\nthe other hand, we verify quantum correlations of a heralded, split\nsingle-photon state via the conditional click statistics together with a\ngeneralization to higher-order moments. We discuss the performance of the\npresented nonclassicality criteria to successfully discern joint and\nconditional quantum correlations. Remarkably, our results are obtained without\nmaking any assumptions on the response function, quantum efficiency, and\ndark-count rate of the photodetectors.\n", "  Quantum Darwinism recognizes the role of the environment as a communication\nchannel: Decoherence can selectively amplify information about the pointer\nstates of a system of interest (preventing access to complementary information\nabout their superpositions) and can make records of this information accessible\nto many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective,\nclassical reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the\namplification of information in realistic spin environments can be quantified\nby the quantum Chernoff information, which characterizes the distinguishability\nof partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except\nfor a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires\nredundant information. Moreover, the Chernoff information captures the rich\nbehavior of amplification in both finite and infinite spin environments, from\nquadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These results will\nconsiderably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using\nnitrogen vacancies in diamond.\n", "  The R&D project COSINUS (Cryogenic Observatory for SIgnatures seen in\nNext-generation Underground Searches) aims to develop a cryogenic scintillating\ncalorimeter using NaI as target crystal for direct darkmatter search. Dark\nmatter particles interacting with the detector material generate both a phonon\nsignal and scintillation light. While the phonon signal provides a precise\ndetermination of the deposited energy, the simultaneously measured\nscintillation light allows for a particle identification on an event-by-event\nbasis, a powerful tool to study material-dependent interactions, and to\nsuppress backgrounds. Using the same target material as the DAMA/LIBRA\ncollaboration, the COSINUS technique may offer a unique possibility to\ninvestigate and contribute information to the presently controversial situation\nin the dark matter sector. We report on the dedicated design planned for the\nNaI proof-of-principle detector and the objectives of using this detection\ntechnique in the light of direct dark matter detection.\n", "  Development of exponentially scaling methods has seen great progress in\ntackling larger systems than previously thought possible. One such technique,\nfull configuration interaction quantum Monte Carlo, is a useful algorithm that\nallows exact diagonalization through stochastically sampling determinants. The\nmethod derives its utility from the information in the matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian, along with a stochastic projected wave function, to find the\nimportant parts of Hilbert space. However, the stochastic representation of the\nwave function is not required to search Hilbert space efficiently, and here we\ndescribe a highly efficient deterministic method to achieve chemical accuracy\nfor a wide range of systems, including the difficult Cr$_{2}$ dimer. In\naddition our method also allows efficient calculation of excited state\nenergies, for which we illustrate with benchmark results for the excited states\nof C$_{2}$.\n", "  This article reviews atmospheric changes associated with 44 solar eclipses,\nbeginning with the first quantitative results available, from 1834 (earlier\nqualitative, accounts also exist). Eclipse meteorology attracted relatively few\npublications until the total solar eclipse of 16 February 1980, with the 11\nAugust 1999 eclipse producing the most papers. Eclipses passing over populated\nareas such as Europe, China and India now regularly attract scientific\nattention, whereas atmospheric measurements of eclipses at remote locations\nremain rare. Many measurements and models have been used to exploit the\nuniquely predictable solar forcing provided by an eclipse. In this paper we\ncompile the available publications and review a sub-set of them chosen on the\nbasis of importance and novelty. Beyond the obvious reduction in incoming solar\nradiation, atmospheric cooling from eclipses can induce dynamical changes.\nObservations and meteorological modelling provide evidence for the generation\nof a local eclipse circulation which may be the origin of the \"eclipse wind\".\nGravity waves set up by the eclipse can, in principle, be detected as\natmospheric pressure fluctuations, though theoretical predictions are limited,\nand many of the data are inconclusive. Eclipse events providing important early\ninsights into the ionisation of the upper atmosphere are also briefly reviewed.\n", "  Very high energy (VHE; energy $E \\gtrsim 100\\,$GeV) $\\gamma$-rays originating\nfrom extragalactic sources undergo pair production with low-energy photons of\nbackground radiation fields. These pairs can inverse-Compton-scatter background\nphotons, initiating an electromagnetic cascade. The spatial and temporal\nstructure of this secondary $\\gamma$-ray signal is altered as the $e^+e^-$\npairs are deflected in an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF). We investigate\nhow VHE observations with the future Cherenkov Telescope Array with its high\nangular resolution and broad energy range, can potentially probe the IGMF. We\nidentify promising sources and simulate $\\gamma$-ray spectra over a wide range\nof values of the IGMF strength and coherence length using the publicly\navailable ELMAG Monte Carlo code. Combining simulated observations in a joint\nlikelihood approach, we find that current limits on the IGMF can be\nsignificantly improved. The projected sensitivity depends strongly on the time\na source has been $\\gamma$-ray active and on the emitted maximum $\\gamma$-ray\nenergy.\n", "  We discuss the motivations, difficulties and progress in the study of\nsupersymmetric lattice gauge theories focusing in particular on ${\\cal N}=1$\nand ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in four dimensions. Brief reviews of the\ncorresponding lattice formalisms are given and current results are presented\nand discussed. We conclude with a summary of the main aspects of current work\nand prospects for the future.\n", "  A scan of the top production threshold at a future electron-positron collider\nprovides the possibility for a precise measurement of the top quark mass in\ntheoretically well-defined mass schemes. With statistical uncertainties of 20\nMeV or below, systematics will likely dominate the total uncertainty of the\nmeasurement. This contribution presents a first look at the impact of the\nrenormalization scale uncertainties in recent NNNLO calculations of the top\npair production cross section in the threshold region on the measurement of the\ntop quark mass at the International Linear Collider.\n", "  Recent LHC data show hints of a new resonance in the diphoton distribution at\nan invariant mass of 750 GeV. Interestingly, this new particle might be both CP\nodd and play the role of a portal into the dark matter sector. Under these\nassumptions and motivated by the fact that the requirement of $SU(2)_L$\ninvariance automatically implies the coupling of this alleged new resonance to\n$ZZ$ and $Z\\gamma$, we investigate the current and future constraints coming\nfrom the indirect searches performed through the neutrino telescope IceCube. We\nshow that these constraints can be stronger than the ones from direct detection\nexperiments if the dark matter mass is larger than a few hundred GeV.\nFurthermore, in the scenario in which the dark matter is a scalar particle, the\nIceCube data limit the cross section between the DM and the proton to values\nclose to the predicted ones for natural values of the parameters.\n", "  We provide an up-to-date review of the recent constructive program for field\ntheories of the vector, matrix and tensor type, focusing not on the models\nthemselves but on the mathematical tools used.\n", "  Exciton optical transitions in transition-metal dichalcogenides offer unique\nopportunities to study rich many-body physics. Recent experiments in monolayer\nWSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ have shown that while the low-temperature photoluminescence\nfrom neutral excitons and three-body complexes is suppressed in the presence of\nelevated electron densities or strong photoexcitation, new dominant peaks\nemerge in the low-energy side of the spectrum. I present a theory that\nelucidates the nature of these optical transitions showing the role of the\nintervalley Coulomb interaction. After deriving a compact dynamical form for\nthe Coulomb potential, I calculate the self-energy of electrons due to their\ninteraction with this potential. For electrons in the upper valleys of the\nspin-split conduction band, the self energy includes a moderate redshift due to\nexchange, and most importantly, a correlation-induced virtual state in the\nband-gap. The latter sheds light on the origin of the luminescence in monolayer\nWSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ in the presence of pronounced many-body interactions.\n", "  In this work we investigate the description of superconducting systems with\nmultiple Fermi surfaces. For the case of one Fermi surface we re-obtain the\nresult that the superconductor is more precisely described as a topological\nstate of matter. Studying the case of more than one Fermi surface, we obtain\nthe effective theory describing a time reversal symmetric topological\nsuperconductor. These results are obtained by employing a general procedure to\nconstruct effective low energy actions describing states of electromagnetic\nsystems interacting with charges and defects. The procedure consists in taking\ninto account the proliferation or dilution of these charges and defects and its\nconsequences for the low energy description of the electromagnetic response of\nthe system. We find that the main ingredient entering the low energy\ncharacterization of the system with more the one Fermi surface is a\nnon-conservation of the canonical supercurrent triggered by particular vortex\nconfigurations.\n", "  A recent framework of quantum theory with no global causal order predicts the\nexistence of \"causally nonseparable\" processes. Some of these processes produce\ncorrelations incompatible with any causal order (they violate so-called \"causal\ninequalities\" analogous to Bell inequalities) while others do not (they admit a\n\"causal model\" analogous to a local model). Here we show for the first time\nthat bipartite causally nonseparable processes with a causal model exist, and\ngive evidence that they have no clear physical interpretation. We also provide\nan algorithm to generate processes of this kind and show that they have nonzero\nmeasure in the set of all processes. We demonstrate the existence of processes\nwhich stop violating causal inequalities but are still causally nonseparable\nwhen mixed with a certain amount of \"white noise\". This is reminiscent of the\nbehavior of Werner states in the context of entanglement and nonlocality.\nFinally, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of causally\nnonseparable processes which have a causal model even when extended with an\nentangled state shared among the parties.\n", "  We revisit the effect of local interactions on the quadratic band touching\n(QBT) of Bernal stacked bilayer graphene models using renormalization group\n(RG) arguments and quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model. We\npresent an RG argument which predicts, contrary to previous studies, that weak\ninteractions do not flow to strong coupling even if the free dispersion has a\nQBT. Instead they generate a linear term in the dispersion, which causes the\ninteractions to flow back to weak coupling. Consistent with this RG scenario,\nin unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model we find\ncompelling evidence that antiferromagnetism turns on at a finite $U/t$, despite\nthe $U=0$ hopping problem having a QBT. The onset of antiferromagnetism takes\nplace at a continuous transition which is consistent with a dynamical critical\nexponent $z=1$ as expected for 2+1 d Gross-Neveu criticality. We conclude that\ngenerically in models of bilayer graphene, even if the free dispersion has a\nQBT, small local interactions generate a Dirac phase with no symmetry breaking\nand that there is a finite-coupling transition out of this phase to a\nsymmetry-broken state.\n", "  We consider a generalized central spin model, consisting of two central\nqubits and an environmental spin chain (with periodic boundary condition) to\nwhich these central qubits are locally and weakly connected either at the same\nsite or at two different sites separated by a distance $d$. Our purpose is to\nstudy the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by\nconcurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. In the\nequilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value\nof $d$ when the environmental spin chain is critical. Importantly, a common\nfeature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations\nwhile the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental\ntransverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the\ncritical quenching. Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,\nour study for $d\\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above\nwhich concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number\nof independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the\nlocal difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians\ngoverning the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by\nthe concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is\ncharacterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The\nconcurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with\nthe most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the\nconcurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one\nof the intermediate DCs. Analyzing the reduced density of a single qubit, we\nalso explain the observation that the dephasing rate is always slower than the\nunentanglement rate.\n", "  We investigate a minimal scale-invariant implementation of the scotogenic\nmodel and show that viable electroweak symmetry breaking can occur while\nsimultaneously generating one-loop neutrino masses and the dark matter relic\nabundance. The model predicts the existence of a singlet scalar (dilaton) that\nplays the dual roles of triggering electroweak symmetry breaking and sourcing\nlepton number violation. Important constraints are studied, including those\nfrom lepton flavor violating effects and dark matter direct-detection\nexperiments. The latter turn out to be somewhat severe, already excluding large\nregions of parameter space. None the less, viable regions of parameter space\nare found, corresponding to dark matter masses below (roughly) 10 GeV and above\n200 GeV.\n", "  In this work, we have considered a gauged $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ extension of the\nStandard Model (SM) with three right handed neutrinos for anomaly cancellation\nand two additional SM singlet complex scalars with non-trivial B-L charges. One\nof these is used to spontaneously break the $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge symmetry,\nleading to Majorana masses for the neutrinos through the standard Type I seesaw\nmechanism, while the other becomes the dark matter (DM) candidate in the model.\nWe test the viability of the model to simultaneously explain the DM relic\ndensity observed in the CMB data as well as the Galactic Centre (GC)\n$\\gamma$-ray excess seen by Fermi-LAT. We show that for DM masses in the range\n40-55 GeV and for a wide range of $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ gauge boson masses, one can\nsatisfy both these constraints if the additional neutral Higgs scalar has a\nmass around the resonance region. In studying the dark matter phenomenology and\nGC excess, we have taken into account theoretical as well as experimental\nconstraints coming from vacuum stability condition, PLANCK bound on DM relic\ndensity, LHC and LUX and present allowed areas in the model parameter space\nconsistent with all relevant data, calculate the predicted gamma ray flux from\nthe GC and discuss the related phenomenology.\n", "  Quantum chemical studies of reactivity involve calculations on a large number\nof molecular structures and comparison of their energies. Already the set-up of\nthese calculations limits the scope of the results that one will obtain,\nbecause several system-specific variables such as the charge and spin need to\nbe set prior to the calculation. For a reliable exploration of reaction\nmechanisms, a considerable number of calculations with varying global\nparameters must be taken into account, or important facts about the reactivity\nof the system under consideration can go undetected. For example, one could\nmiss crossings of potential energy surfaces for different spin states or might\nnot note that a molecule is prone to oxidation. Here, we introduce the concept\nof molecular propensity to account for the predisposition of a molecular system\nto react across different electronic states in certain nuclear configurations.\nWithin our real-time quantum chemistry framework, we developed an algorithm\nthat allows us to be alerted to such a propensity of a system under\nconsideration.\n", "  The lattice thermal conductivity of silicon clathrate framework Si$_{23}$ and\ntwo Zintl clathrates, [Si$_{19}$P$_{4}$]Cl$_{4}$ and\nNa$_{4}$[Al$_{4}$Si$_{19}$], is investigated by using an iterative solution of\nthe linearized Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) in conjuntion with ab initio\nlattice dynamical techniques. At 300 K, the lattice thermal conductivities for\nSi$_{23}$, [Si$_{19}$P$_{4}$]Cl$_{4}$, and Na$_{4}$[Al$_{4}$Si$_{19}$] were\nfound to be 43 W/(m K), 25 W/(m K), and 2 W/(m K), respectively. In the case of\nNa$_{4}$[Al$_{4}$Si$_{19}$], the order-of-magnitude reduction in the lattice\nthermal conductivity was found to be mostly due to relaxation times and group\nvelocities differing from Si$_{23}$ and [Si$_{19}$P$_{4}$]Cl$_{4}$. The\ndifference in the relaxation times and group velocities arises primarily due to\nthe phonon spectrum at low frequencies, resulting eventually from the\ndifferences in the second-order interatomic force constants (IFCs). The\nobtained third-order IFCs were rather similar for all materials considered\nhere.\n", "  Recent work has shown that a variety of novel phases of matter arise in\nperiodically driven Floquet systems. Among these are many-body localized phases\nwhich spontaneously break global symmetries and exhibit novel multiplets of\nFloquet eigenstates separated by quantized quasienergies. Here we show that\nthese properties are stable to all weak local deformations of the underlying\nFloquet drives -- including those that explicitly break the defining symmetries\n-- and that the models considered until now occupy sub-manifolds within these\nlarger \"absolutely stable\" phases. While these absolutely stable phases have no\nexplicit global symmetries, they spontaneously break Hamiltonian dependent\nemergent symmetries, and thus continue to exhibit the novel multiplet\nstructure. The multiplet structure in turn encodes characteristic oscillations\nof the emergent order parameter at multiples of the fundamental period.\nAltogether these phases exhibit a form of simultaneous long-range order in\nspace and time which is new to quantum systems. We describe how this\nspatiotemporal order can be detected in experiments involving quenches from a\nbroad class of initial states.\n", "  We present the latest Hyper-Kamiokande sensitivity study showing that, with a\ntotal exposure of 13 MW $\\times 10^{7}$ seconds integrated beam power, the CP\nphase - $\\delta_{CP}$ - can be determined better than 21 degrees for all\npossible values of $\\delta_{CP}$ and CP violation can be established with a\nsignificance of more than 3$\\sigma$ (5$\\sigma$) for 78% (62%) of the\n$\\delta_{CP}$ parameter space.\n", "  We show that a thermally isolated system driven across a quantum phase\ntransition by a noisy control field exhibits anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior,\nwhereby slower driving results in higher excitations. We characterize the\ndensity of excitations as a function of the ramping rate and the noise\nstrength. The optimal driving time to minimize excitations is shown to scale as\na universal power law of the noise strength. Our findings reveal the\nlimitations of adiabatic protocols such as quantum annealing and demonstrate\nthe universality of the optimal ramping rate.\n", "  It has long been recognized that the neutrinos detected from the next\ncore-collapse supernova in the Galaxy have the potential to reveal important\ninformation about the dynamics of the explosion and the nucleosynthesis\nconditions as well as allowing us to probe the properties of the neutrino\nitself. The neutrinos emitted from thermonuclear - type Ia - supernovae also\npossess the same potential, although these supernovae are dimmer neutrino\nsources. For the first time, we calculate the time, energy, line of sight, and\nneutrino-flavor-dependent features of the neutrino signal expected from a\nthree-dimensional delayed-detonation explosion simulation, where a\ndeflagration-to-detonation transition triggers the complete disruption of a\nnear-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We also calculate the\nneutrino flavor evolution along eight lines of sight through the simulation as\na function of time and energy using an exact three-flavor transformation code.\nWe identify a characteristic spectral peak at $\\sim 10$ MeV as a signature of\nelectron captures on copper. This peak is a potentially distinguishing feature\nof explosion models since it reflects the nucleosynthesis conditions early in\nthe explosion. We simulate the event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, and\nDUNE neutrino detectors with the SNOwGLoBES event rate calculation software and\nalso compute the IceCube signal. Hyper-K will be able to detect neutrinos from\nour model out to a distance of $\\sim 10$ kpc. At 1 kpc, JUNO, Super-K, and DUNE\nwould register a few events while IceCube and Hyper-K would register several\ntens of events.\n", "  Non-uniform metasurfaces (electrically thin composite layers) can be used for\nshaping refracted and reflected electromagnetic waves. However, known design\napproaches based on the generalized refraction and reflection laws do not allow\nrealization of perfectly performing devices: there are always some parasitic\nreflections into undesired directions. In this paper we introduce and discuss a\ngeneral approach to the synthesis of metasurfaces for full control of\ntransmitted and reflected plane waves and show that perfect performance can be\nrealized. The method is based on the use of an equivalent impedance matrix\nmodel which connects the tangential field components at the two sides on the\nmetasurface. With this approach we are able to understand what physical\nproperties of the metasurface are needed in order to perfectly realize the\ndesired response. Furthermore, we determine the required polarizabilities of\nthe metasurface unit cells and discuss suitable cell structures. It appears\nthat only spatially dispersive metasurfaces allow realization of perfect\nrefraction and reflection of incident plane waves into arbitrary directions. In\nparticular, ideal refraction is possible only if the metasurface is\nbianisotropic (weak spatial dispersion), and ideal reflection without\npolarization transformation requires spatial dispersion with a specific,\nstrongly non-local response to the fields.\n", "  A quantitative discussion on the future prospects of the 750 GeV resonance at\nthe LHC experiment is given using a simple effective field theory analysis. The\nrelative size of two effective operators relevant to diphoton decays can be\nprobed by ratios of diboson signals in a robust way. We obtain the future\nsensitivities of $Z\\gamma $, $ZZ$ and $WW$ resonance searches at the high\nluminosity LHC, rescaling from the current sensitivities at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV.\nThen, we show that a large fraction of parameter space in the effective field\ntheory will be covered with 300 fb$^{-1}$ and almost the whole parameter space\nwill be tested with 3000 fb$^{-1}$. This discussion is independent of\nproduction processes, other decay modes and total decay width.\n", "  The asymptotic suction boundary layer (ASBL) is a parallel shear flow that\nbecomes turbulent in a bypass transition in parameter regions where the laminar\nprofile is stable. We here add a temperature gradient perpendicular to the\nplate and explore the interaction between convection and shear in determining\nthe transition. We find that the laminar state becomes unstable in a\nsubcritical bifurcation and that the critical Rayleigh number and wavenumber\ndepend strongly on the Prandtl number. We also track several secondary\nbifurcations and identify states that are localized in two directions, showing\ndifferent symmetries. In the subcritical regime, transient turbulent states\nwhich are connected to exact coherent states and follow the same transition\nscenario as found in linearly stable shear flows are identified and analyzed.\nThe study extends the bypass transition scenario from shear flows to thermal\nboundary layers and highlights the intricate interactions between thermal and\nshear forces.\n", "  We present a family of spherically symmetric Lorentzian wormholes in\nquadratic F(R) gravity, with a thin shell of matter corresponding to the\nthroat. At each side of the shell the geometry has a different constant value\nof the curvature scalar R. The junction conditions determine the equation of\nstate between the pressure and energy density at the throat, where a double\nlayer is also located. We analyze the stability of the configurations under\nperturbations preserving the spherical symmetry. In particular, we study\nthin-shell wormholes with mass and charge. We find that there exist values of\nthe parameters for which stable static solutions are possible.\n", "  We investigate the existence and phenomenology of stable photon orbits (SPOs)\nin stationary axisymmetric electrovacuum spacetimes in four dimensions. First,\nwe review the classification of equatorial circular photon orbits on\nKerr-Newman spacetimes in the charge-spin plane. Second, using a Hamiltonian\nformulation, we show that Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om di-holes (a family encompassing\nthe Majumdar-Papapetrou and Weyl-Bach special cases) admit SPOs, in a certain\nparameter regime that we investigate. Third, we explore the transition from\norder to chaos for typical SPOs bounded within a toroidal region around a\ndi-hole, via a selection of Poincar\\'e sections. Finally, for general\naxisymmetric stationary spacetimes, we show that the Einstein-Maxwell field\nequations allow for the existence of SPOs in electrovacuum; but not in pure\nvacuum.\n", "  Transverse electric (TE) surface wave in silicine is theoretically\ninvestigated. The TE surface wave in silicene is found to exhibit better\ncharacteristics compared with that in graphene, in terms of a broader frequency\nrange and more confinement to the surface which originate from the buckled\nstructure of silicene. We found that even undoped silicene can support the TE\nsurface wave. We expect to obtain the similar characteristics of the TE surface\nwave in other two-dimensional materials that have slightly buckled honeycomb\nlattice.\n", "  It is quite relevant the extension of decoration transformation for quantum\nspin models since most of the real materials could be well described by\nHeisenberg type models. Here we propose an exact quantum decoration\ntransformation and also showing interesting properties such as the persistence\nof symmetry and the symmetry breaking during this transformation. Although the\nproposed transformation, in principle, cannot be used to map exactly a quantum\nspin lattice model into another quantum spin lattice model, since the operators\nare non-commutative. However, it is possible the mapping in the \"classical\"\nlimit, establishing an equivalence between both quantum spin lattice models. To\nstudy the validity of this approach for quantum spin lattice model, we use the\nZassenhaus formula, and we verify how the correction could influence the\ndecoration transformation. But this correction could be useless to improve the\nquantum decoration transformation because it involves the\nsecond-nearest-neighbor and further nearest neighbor couplings, which leads\ninto a cumbersome task to establish the equivalence between both lattice\nmodels. This correction also gives us valuable information about its\ncontribution, for most of the Heisenberg type models, this correction could be\nirrelevant at least up to the third order term of Zassenhaus formula. This\ntransformation is applied to a finite size Heisenberg chain, comparing with the\nexact numerical results, our result is consistent for weak xy-anisotropy\ncoupling. We also apply to bond-alternating Ising-Heisenberg chain model,\nobtaining an accurate result in the limit of the quasi-Ising chain.\n", "  We verify the consistency of the G\\\"odel-type solutions within the\nfour-dimensional Chern-Simons modified gravity with the non-dynamical\nChern-Simons coefficient, for different forms of matter including dust, fluid,\nscalar field and electromagnetic field, and the related causality issues.\nUnlike the general relativity, the vacuum solution turns out to be possible in\nour theory. Another essentially new result of our theory having no analogue in\nthe general relativity consists in the existence of the hyperbolic causal\nsolutions for the physically well-motivated matter.\n", "  We propose a novel experimental approach to explore exotic spin-dependent\ninteractions using a spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer, the\nmost sensitive non-cryogenic magnetic-field sensor. This approach studies the\ninteractions between optically polarized electron spins located inside a vapor\ncell of the SERF magnetometer and unpolarized or polarized particles of\nexternal solid-state objects. The coupling of spin-dependent interactions to\nthe polarized electron spins of the magnetometer induces the tilt of the\nelectron spins, which can be detected with high sensitivity by a probe laser\nbeam similarly as an external magnetic field. We estimate that by moving\nunpolarized or polarized objects next to the SERF Rb vapor cell, the\nexperimental limit to the spin-dependent interactions can be significantly\nimproved over existing experiments, and new limits on the coupling strengths\ncan be set in the interaction range below 0.01 m.\n", "  In Plato's dialogues Republic and Laws, the most important disciplines for\nthe best education of the rulers of the city are identified with arithmetic,\ngeometry and astronomy. Those disciplines, however, are not intended for\npractical applications, but to reach the truth and see the form of good. In\nparticular, another dialogue, Epinomis, stresses on the relevance of astronomy\nitself as main discipline, since it coincides with the study of the gods, that\nis, the planets and the heaven. According to Epinomis, the wise astronomer does\nnot observe the risings and settings of stars for practical applications such\nas the farmer calendar, but he studies the orbits of the planets. Therefore,\nthe 'practical' astronomy of farmers appears intrinsically less important than\nthe 'theoretical' one, i.e. the study of the planetary motions. We discuss the\npossibly far-reaching negative implications of such a specific discrimination.\nWe report some examples taken from Greek and Latin literature illustrating the\ndifficulties of a coherent description of the risings and settings of stars\nthat was attempted by scholars, and should have been of little help for\nfarming. We conclude by pointing out the practical importance of astronomy\n(intended in a broad sense) even today, and of the dangers of the separation or\ndiscrimination of disciplines and sub-disciplines for the culture during the\npresent global economic crisis.\n", "  We report on the Lagrangian statistics of acceleration of small\n(sub-Kolmogorov) bubbles and tracer particles with Stokes number St << 1 in\nturbulent flow. At decreasing Reynolds number, the bubble accelerations show\ndeviations from that of tracer particles, i.e. they deviate from the\nHeisenberg-Yaglom prediction and show a quicker decorrelation despite their\nsmall size and minute St. Using direct numerical simulations, we show that\nthese effects arise due the drift of these particles through the turbulent\nflow. We theoretically predict this gravity-driven effect for developed\nisotropic turbulence, with the ratio of Stokes to Froude number or equivalently\nthe particle drift-velocity governing the enhancement of acceleration variance\nand the reductions in correlation time and intermittency. Our predictions are\nin good agreement with experimental and numerical results. The present findings\nare relevant to a range of scenarios encompassing tiny bubbles and droplets\nthat drift through the turbulent oceans and the atmosphere. They also question\nthe common usage of micro-bubbles and micro-droplets as tracers in turbulence\nresearch.\n", "  We present a measurement of the top quark mass in ppbar collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The data\nwere collected by the D0 experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 9.7 fb-1. The matrix element technique is applied to ttbar events in the\nfinal state containing leptons (electrons or muons) with high transverse\nmomenta and at least two jets. The calibration of the jet energy scale\ndetermined in the lepton + jets final state of ttbar decays is applied to jet\nenergies. This correction provides a substantial reduction in systematic\nuncertainties. We obtain a top quark mass of mt = 173.93 +- 1.84 GeV.\n", "  Giant molecular clouds contain supersonic turbulence that can locally heat\nsmall fractions of gas to over 100 K. We run shock models for low-velocity,\nC-type shocks propagating into gas with densities between 10^3 and 10^5 cm^(-3)\nand find that CO lines are the most important cooling lines. Comparison to\nphotodissociation region (PDR) models indicates that mid-J CO lines (J = 8-7\nand higher) should be dominated by emission from shocked gas. In Papers I and\nII we presented CO J = 3-2, 8-7, and 9-8 observations toward four primarily\nquiescent clumps within infrared dark clouds. Here we fit PDR models to the\ncombined spectral line energy distributions and show that the PDR models that\nbest fit the low-J CO emission underpredict the mid-J CO emission by orders of\nmagnitude, strongly hinting at a hot gas component within these clumps. The\nlow-J CO data clearly show that the integrated intensities of both the CO J =\n8-7 and 9-8 lines are anomalously high, such that the line ratio can be used to\ncharacterize the hot gas component. Shock models are reasonably consistent with\nthe observed mid-J CO emission, with models with densities near 10^(4.5)\ncm^(-3) providing the best agreement. Where this mid-J CO is detected, the mean\nvolume filling factor of the hot gas is 0.1%. Much of the observed mid-J CO\nemission, however, is also associated with known protostars and may be due to\nprotostellar feedback.\n", "  The spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with easy-plane anisotropy in a transverse\nfield describes well the thermodynamic properties of the material ${\\rm\nCs_2CoCl_4}$ in a wide range of temperatures and fields including the region\nclose to the spin-flop Ising quantum phase transition. For a comparison with\nprospective inelastic neutron scattering experiments on this compound, we\npresent results of an extensive numerical study of its dynamic structure factor\n$\\mathcal{S}^{\\alpha \\beta}(k,\\omega)$ using matrix-product-state (MPS)\ntechniques. Close to criticality, the dynamic part of the correlator\n$\\mathcal{S}^{xx}$ longitudinal to the applied field is incoherent and\npossesses a small total weight as the ground state is already close to\nsaturation. The transverse correlator $\\mathcal{S}^{zz}$, on the other hand, is\ndominated by a coherent single-particle excitation with additional spectral\nweight at higher energies that we tentatively attribute to a repulsively bound\npair of particles. With increasing temperature, the latter quickly fades and\nspectral weight instead accumulates close to zero wavevector just above the\nsingle-particle energy. On a technical level, we compare the numerical\nefficiency of real-time evolution to an MPS-based Chebyshev expansion in the\npresent context, finding that both methods yield results of similar quality at\ncomparable numerical costs.\n", "  We present a spectral representation of any computation performed by a\nCellular Automaton (CA) of arbitrary topology and dimensionality via an\nappropriate coding scheme in Fourier space that can be implemented in an analog\nmachine ideally circumventing part of the overall waste heat production. We\nexplore further consequences of this encoding and we provide a simple example\nbased on the Game-of-Life where we find global maps for small lattices\nindicating an interesting underlying recursive structure.\n", "  Time-series of allele frequencies are a useful and unique set of data to\ndetermine the strength of natural selection on the background of genetic drift.\nTechnically, the selection coefficient is estimated by means of a likelihood\nfunction built under the hypothesis that the available trajectory spans a\nsufficiently large portion of the fitness landscape. Especially for ancient\nDNA, however, often only one single such trajectories is available and the\ncoverage of the fitness landscape is very limited. In fact, one single\ntrajectory is more representative of a process conditioned both in the initial\nand in the final condition than of a process free to visit the available\nfitness landscape. Based on two models of population genetics, here we show how\nto build a likelihood function for the selection coefficient that takes the\nstatistical peculiarity of single trajectories into account. We show that this\nconditional likelihood delivers a precise estimate of the selection coefficient\nalso when allele frequencies are close to fixation whereas the unconditioned\nlikelihood fails. Finally, we discuss the fact that the traditional,\nunconditioned likelihood always delivers an answer, which is often\nunfalsifiable and appears reasonable also when it is not correct.\n", "  We show that the quantification of entanglement of any rank-2 state with any\npolynomial entanglement measure can be recast as a geometric problem on the\ncorresponding Bloch sphere. This approach provides novel insight into the\nproperties of entanglement and allows us to relate different polynomial\nmeasures to each other, simplifying their quantification. In particular,\nunveiling and exploiting the geometric structure of the concurrence for two\nqubits, we show that the convex roof of any polynomial measure of entanglement\ncan be quantified exactly for all rank-2 states of an arbitrary number of\nqubits which have only one or two unentangled states in their range. We give\nexplicit examples by quantifying the three-tangle exactly for several\nrepresentative classes of three-qubit states. We further show how our methods\ncan be used to obtain analytical results for entanglement of more complex\nstates if one can exploit symmetries in their geometric representation.\n", "  A full amplitude analysis of $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p \\pi^-$ decays is\nperformed with a data sample acquired with the LHCb detector from 7 and 8 TeV\n$pp$ collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. A\nsignificantly better description of the data is achieved when, in addition to\nthe previously observed nucleon excitations $N\\to p\\pi^-$, either the\n$P_c(4380)^+$ and $P_c(4450)^+\\to J/\\psi p$ states, previously observed in\n$\\Lambda_b^0 \\to J/\\psi p K^-$ decays, or the $Z_c(4200)^-\\to J/\\psi \\pi^-$\nstate, previously reported in $B^0 \\to J/\\psi K^+ \\pi^-$ decays, or all three,\nare included in the amplitude models. The data support a model containing all\nthree exotic states, with a significance of more than three standard\ndeviations. Within uncertainties, the data are consistent with the\n$P_c(4380)^+$ and $P_c(4450)^+$ production rates expected from their previous\nobservation taking account of Cabibbo suppression.\n", "  We study the low-pressure (0 to 10 GPa) phase diagram of crystalline benzene\nusing quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) and density functional theory (DFT) methods. We\nconsider the $Pbca$, $P4_32_12$, and $P2_1/c$ structures as the best candidates\nfor phase I and phase II. We perform diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC)\ncalculations to obtain accurate static phase diagrams as benchmarks for modern\nvan der Waals density functionals. We use density functional perturbation\ntheory to compute phonon contribution in the free-energy calculations. Our DFT\nenthalpy-pressure phase diagram indicates that the $Pbca$ and $P2_1/c$\nstructures are the most stable phases within the studied pressure range. The\nDMC Gibbs free-energy calculations predict that the room temperature $Pbca$ to\n$P2_1/c$ phase transition occurs at 2.1(1) GPa. This prediction is consistent\nwith available experimental results at room temperature. Our DMC calculations\nshow an estimate of 50.6$\\pm$0.5 kJ/mol for crystalline benzene lattice energy.\n", "  We use FIRAS and Planck 2015 data to place observational bounds on\ninflationary scenarios in multi-fractional spacetimes with $q$-derivatives.\nWhile a power-law expansion in the geometric time coordinate is subject to the\nusual constraints from the tensor-to-scalar ratio, model-independent best fits\nof the black-body and scalar spectra yield upper limits on the free parameters\nof the multi-fractal measure of the theory. When the measure describing the\nfractal spacetime geometry is non-oscillating, information on the CMB\nblack-body spectrum places constraints on the theory independent from but\nweaker than those obtained from the Standard Model, astrophysical gravitational\nwaves and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). When log oscillations are included and the\nmeasure describes a discrete fractal spacetime at microscopic scales, we obtain\nthe first observational constraints on the amplitudes of such oscillations and\nfind, in general, strong constraints on the multi-scale geometry and on the\ndimension of space. These results complete the scan and reduction of the\nparameter space of the theory. Black-body bounds are obtained also for the\ntheory with weighted derivatives.\n", "  The proposed analogy of particle production from high-energy collisions and\nHawking-Unruh radiation from black holes is extended to finite density\n(collisions) and finite-electric charge (black holes). Assuming that the\nelectric charge is directly proportional to the density (or the chemical\npotential), it becomes clear that for at least two freezeout conditions;\nconstant $s/T^3$ and $E/N$, the proposed analogy works very well. Dependence of\nradiation (freezeout) temperature on finite electric-charge leads to an\nexcellent estimation for Kaon-to-pion ratio, for instance, especially in the\nenergy range covered by NICA. The precise and complete measurements for various\nlight-flavored particle yields and ratios are essential in characterizing\nHawing-Unruh radiation from charged black holes and the QCD hadronization at\nfinite density, as well.\n", "  The spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg two-leg ladder accounting for alternating Ising\nand Heisenberg inter-leg couplings in addition to the Ising intra-leg coupling\nis rigorously mapped onto to a mixed spin-(3/2,1/2) Ising-Heisenberg diamond\nchain with the nodal Ising spins $S=3/2$ and the interstitial spin-1/2\nHeisenberg dimers. The latter effective model with higher-order interactions\nbetween the nodal and interstitial spins is subsequently exactly solved within\nthe transfer-matrix method. The model under investigation exhibits five\ndifferent ground states: ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic,\nsuperantiferromagnetic and two types of frustrated ground states with a\nnon-zero residual entropy. A detailed study of thermodynamic properties reveals\nan anomalous specific-heat peak at low enough temperatures, which is strongly\nreminiscent because of its extraordinary height and sharpness to an anomaly\naccompanying a phase transition. It is convincingly evidenced, however, that\nthe anomalous peak in the specific heat is finite and it comes from vigorous\nthermal excitations from a two-fold degenerate ground state towards a\nmacroscopically degenerate excited state. Thermal entanglement between the\nnearest-neighbor Heisenberg spins is also comprehensively explored by taking\nadvantage of the concurrence. The threshold temperature delimiting a boundary\nbetween the entangled and disentangled parameter space may show presence of a\npeculiar temperature reentrance.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of implementing axiomatic nonextensive statistics,\nwhere it is conjectured that the phase-space volume determines the\n(non)extensive entropy, on the particle production at NICA energies. Both\nBoltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis statistics are very special cases of this generic\n(non)extensivity. We conclude that the lattice thermodynamics is {\\it ab\ninitio} extensive and additive and thus the nonextensive approaches including\nTsallis statistics categorically are not matching with them, while the particle\nproduction, for instance the particle ratios at various center-of-mass\nenergies, is likely a nonextensive process but certainly not of Tsallis type.\nThe resulting freezeout parameters, the temperature and the chemical\npotentials, are approximately compatible with the ones deduced from\nBoltzmann-Gibbs statistics.\n", "  The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider is a major upgrade of the\nKEK \"$B$ factory\" facility in Tsukuba, Japan. Phase 1 commissioning of the main\nring of SuperKEKB has started in February 2016 and first physics data will be\nrecorded in 2017 during the so-called Phase 2 commissioning, when the partial\nBelle II detector will be operated still without its vertex detector. In 2018,\nthe full Belle II detector will be rolled in and physics run will start. In\nthis proceeding, a possible physics program for this early data run at\ndifferent center-of-mass energies is described, in particular at the\n$\\Upsilon(3S)$ and $\\Upsilon(6S)$ resonances, amongst other energy points.\n", "  Observations of pulsars across the radio spectrum are revealing a dependence\nof the characteristic scattering time ($\\tau$) on frequency, which is more\ncomplex than the simple power law with a theoretically predicted power law\nindex. In this paper we investigate these effects using simulated pulsar data\nat frequencies below 300 MHz. We investigate different scattering mechanisms,\nnamely isotropic and anisotropic scattering, by thin screens along the line of\nsight, and the particular frequency dependent impact on pulsar profiles and\nscattering time scales of each. We also consider how the screen shape, location\nand offset along the line of sight lead to specific observable effects. We\nevaluate how well forward fitting techniques perform in determining $\\tau$. We\ninvestigate the systematic errors in $\\tau$ associated with the use of an\nincorrect fitting method and with the determination of an off-pulse baseline.\nOur simulations provide examples of average pulse profiles at various\nfrequencies. Using these we compute spectra of $\\tau$ and mean flux for\ndifferent scattering setups. We identify setups that lead to deviations from\nthe simple theoretical picture. This work provides a framework for\ninterpretation of upcoming low frequency data, both in terms of modelling the\ninterstellar medium and understanding intrinsic emission properties of pulsars.\n", "  In this article we consider the possibility of controlling the dynamics of\nnonlinear discrete systems. A new method of control is by mixing states of the\nsystem (or the functions of these states) calculated on previous steps. This\napproach allows us to locally stabilize a priori unknown cycles of a given\nlength. As a special case, we have a cycle stabilization using nonlinear\nfeedback. Several examples are considered.\n", "  The distribution of the orbital elements of the known extreme trans-Neptunian\nobjects or ETNOs has been found to be statistically incompatible with that of\nan unperturbed asteroid population following heliocentric or, better,\nbarycentric orbits. Such trends, if confirmed by future discoveries of ETNOs,\nstrongly suggest that one or more massive perturbers could be located well\nbeyond Pluto. Within the trans-Plutonian planets paradigm, the Planet Nine\nhypothesis has received much attention as a robust scenario to explain the\nobserved clustering in physical space of the perihelia of seven ETNOs which\nalso exhibit clustering in orbital pole position. Here, we revisit the subject\nof clustering in perihelia and poles of the known ETNOs using barycentric\norbits, and study the visibility of the latest incarnation of the orbit of\nPlanet Nine applying Monte Carlo techniques and focusing on the effects of the\napsidal anti-alignment constraint. We provide visibility maps indicating the\nmost likely location of this putative planet if it is near aphelion. We also\nshow that the available data suggest that at least two massive perturbers are\npresent beyond Pluto.\n", "  We present a study of the application of the Jagiellonian Positron Emission\nTomograph (J-PET) for the registration of gamma quanta from decays of\northo-positronium (o-Ps). The J-PET is the first positron emission tomography\nscanner based on organic scintillators in contrast to all current PET scanners\nbased on inorganic crystals. Monte Carlo simulations show that the J-PET as an\naxially symmetric and high acceptance scanner can be used as a multi-purpose\ndetector well suited to pursue research including e.g. tests of discrete\nsymmetries in decays of ortho-positronium in addition to the medical imaging.\nThe gamma quanta originating from o-Ps decay interact in the plastic\nscintillators predominantly via the Compton effect, making the direct\nmeasurement of their energy impossible. Nevertheless, it is shown in this paper\nthat the J-PET scanner will enable studies of the o-Ps$\\to3\\gamma$ decays with\nangular and energy resolution equal to $\\sigma(\\theta) \\approx 0.4^{\\circ}$ and\n$\\sigma(E) \\approx 4.1$ keV, respectively. An order of magnitude shorter decay\ntime of signals from plastic scintillators with respect to the inorganic\ncrystals results not only in better timing properties crucial for the reduction\nof physical and instrumental background, but also suppresses significantly the\npileups, thus enabling compensation of the lower efficiency of the plastic\nscintillators by performing measurements with higher positron source\nactivities.\n", "  The Gaia all-sky astrometric survey is challenged by several issues affecting\nthe spacecraft stability. Amongst them, we find the focus evolution, straylight\nand basic angle variations\n  Contrary to pre-launch expectations, the image quality is continuously\nevolving, during commissioning and the nominal mission. Payload\ndecontaminations and wavefront sensor assisted refocuses have been carried out\nto recover optimum performance. Straylight and basic angle variations several\norders of magnitude greater than foreseen were found and studied during\ncommissioning by the Gaia scientists (payload experts). Building on their\ninvestigations, an ESA-Airbus DS working group was established during the early\nnominal mission and worked on a detailed root cause analysis. In parallel, Gaia\nscientists have also continued analysing the data, most notably comparing the\nBAM signal to global astrometric solutions, with remarkable agreement.\n  In this contribution, a status review of these issues will be provided, with\nemphasis on the mitigation schemes and the lessons learned for future space\nmissions where extreme stability is a key requirement.\n", "  This paper presents the results of specific-heat and magnetization\nmeasurements, in particular their field-orientation dependence, on the first\ndiscovered heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ ($T_{\\rm c} \\sim 0.6$\nK). We discuss the superconducting gap structure and the origin of the\nanomalous pair-breaking phenomena, leading e.g., to the suppression of the\nupper critical field $H_{\\rm c2}$, found in the high-field region. The data\nshow that the anomalous pair breaking becomes prominent below about 0.15 K in\nany field direction, but occurs closer to $H_{\\rm c2}$ for $H \\parallel c$. The\npresence of this anomaly is confirmed by the fact that the specific-heat and\nmagnetization data satisfy standard thermodynamic relations. Concerning the gap\nstructure, field-angle dependences of the low-temperature specific heat within\nthe $ab$ and $ac$ planes do not show any evidence for gap nodes. From\nmicroscopic calculations in the framework of a two-band full-gap model, the\npower-law-like temperature dependences of $C$ and $1/T_1$, reminiscent of nodal\nsuperconductivity, have been reproduced reasonably. These facts further support\nmultiband full-gap superconductivity in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$.\n", "  The star-forming reservoir in the distant Universe can be detected through HI\n21-cm absorption arising from either cool gas associated with a radio source or\nfrom within a galaxy intervening the sight-line to the continuum source. In\norder to test whether the nature of the absorber can be predicted from the\nprofile shape, we have compiled and analysed all of the known redshifted (z >\n0.1) HI 21-cm absorption profiles. Although between individual spectra there is\ntoo much variation to assign a typical spectral profile, we confirm that\nassociated absorption profiles are on average, wider than their intervening\ncounterparts. It is widely hypothesised that this is due to high velocity\nnuclear gas feeding the central engine, absent in the more quiescent\nintervening absorbers. Modelling the column density distribution of the mean\nassociated and intervening spectra, we confirm that the additional low optical\ndepth, wide dispersion component, typical of associated absorbers, arises from\ngas within the inner parsec. With regard to the potential of predicting the\nabsorber type in the absence of optical spectroscopy, we have implemented\nmachine learning techniques to the 55 associated and 43 intervening spectra,\nwith each of the tested models giving a >80% accuracy in the prediction of the\nabsorber type. Given the impracticability of follow-up optical spectroscopy of\nthe large number of 21-cm detections expected from the next generation of large\nradio telescopes, this could provide a powerful new technique with which to\ndetermine the nature of the absorbing galaxy.\n", "  Entangled systems with large quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be used to\noutperform the standard quantum limit of the separable systems in quantum\nmetrology. However, the interaction between the system and the environments\ninevitably leads to decoherence and decrease of the QFI, and it is not clear\nwhether the entanglement systems can be better resource than separable systems\nin the realistic physical condition. In this work, we study the steady QFI of\ntwo driven and collectively damped qubits with homodyne-mediated feedback. We\nshow that the steady QFI can be significantly enhanced both in the cases of\nsymmetric feedback and nonsymmetric feedback, and the shot-noise limit of\nseparable states can be surpassed in both cases. The QFI can even achieve the\nHeisenberg limit for appropriate feedback parameters and initial conditions in\nthe case of symmetric feedback. We also show that an\ninitial-condition-independent steady QFI can be obtained by using nonsymmetric\nfeedback.\n", "  Double-layered Sr3Ru2O7 has received phenomenal consideration because it\nexhibits a plethora of exotic phases when perturbed. New phases emerge with the\napplication of pressure, magnetic field, or doping. Here we show that creating\na surface is an alternative and effective way to reveal hidden phases that are\ndifferent from those seen in the bulk by investigating the surface properties\nof Sr3(Ru1-xMnx)2O7. Driven by the tilt distortion of RuO6 octahedra, the\nsurface of Sr3Ru2O7 is less metallic than the bulk. In contrast, because of the\nvanishing of tilt and enhanced rotation with Mn-doping, the surface of\nSr3(Ru0.84Mn0.16)2O7 is metallic while the bulk is insulating. Our result\ndemonstrates that the electronic and structural properties at the surface are\nintimately coupled and consistent with quasi two-dimensional character.\n", "  An exploding primordial black-hole (PBH) may produce a single pulse of\nelectromagnetic radiation detectable at the low-frequency end of the radio\nspectrum. Furthermore, a radio transient from an exploding PBH could be a\nsignature of an extra spatial dimension. We describe here an approach for\nsearching for PBH explosions using a low-frequency radio antenna array, and as\na practical example, the results of a such a search using the\nEight-meter-wavelength Transient Array (ETA). No compelling astrophysical\nsignal was detected in $\\approx 4$ hours of data implying an observational\nupper limit on the rate of exploding PBHs is $4.2 \\times 10^{-7}\n\\,\\rm{pc}^{-3}\\,\\rm{yr}^{-1}$ for an exploding PBH with a fireball Lorentz\nfactor of $10^{4.5}$ for the standard scenario of Page and Hawking. This rate\nlimit is the strongest constraint yet set for PBH explosions with this fireball\nLorentz factor. Observations ($\\sim300$ hours) using the Arecibo Observatory\nwere used to set a stronger constraint on the rate of PBH explosions for a\nfireball Lorentz factor of $10^{4.6}$ but the limit set by those observations\nfor the fireball Lorentz factor considered here are less stringent by more than\nan order of magnitude. The limits considered here are applicable to exploding\nPBHs in the halo of the Galaxy. These observations also imply an upper limit of\n$2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\rm{pc}^{-3}\\,\\rm{yr}^{-1}$ on the rate of PBH explosions\nin the context of certain extra dimension models as described by Kavic et al.\nThis rate limit is for a fireball Lorentz factor of $10^{4.3}$ which\ncorresponds to an extra dimension compactification scale of $3.0 \\times\n10^{-18}$m.\n", "  We have investigated the tunneling transport of mono- and few-layers of MnPS3\nby using conductive atomic force microscopy. Due to the band alignment of\nindium tin oxide/MnPS3/Pt-Ir tip junction, the key features of both Schottky\njunction and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (FNT) were observed for all the samples\nwith varying thickness. Using the FNT model and assuming the effective electron\nmass (0.5 me) of MnPS3, we estimate the tunneling barrier height to be 1.31 eV\nand the dielectric breakdown strength as 5.41 MV/cm.\n", "  Understanding about both the range and the strength of the effective force\nbetween two hydrophobic surfaces suspended in water is important in many areas\nof natural science but unfortunately has remained imperfect. Even the\nexperimental observations have not been explained quantitatively. Here we find\nby varying distance (d) between two hydrophobic walls in computer simulations\nof water that the force exhibits a bi-exponential distance dependence. The long\nrange part of the force can be fitted to an exponential force law with\ncorrelation length of 2 nm while the short range part displays a correlation\nlength of only 0.5 nm. The crossover from shorter range to longer range force\nlaw is rather sharp. We show that the distance dependence of the tetrahedrality\norder parameter provides a reliable marker of the force law, and exhibits\nsimilar distance dependence.\n", "  Synchronization over networks depends strongly on the structure of the\ncoupling between the oscillators. When the coupling presents certain\nregularities, the dynamics can be coarse-grained into clusters by means of\nExternal Equitable Partitions of the network graph and their associated\nquotient graphs. We exploit this graph-theoretical concept to study the\nphenomenon of cluster synchronization, in which different groups of nodes\nconverge to distinct behaviors. We derive conditions and properties of networks\nin which such clustered behavior emerges, and show that the ensuing dynamics is\nthe result of the localization of the eigenvectors of the associated graph\nLaplacians linked to the existence of invariant subspaces. The framework is\napplied to both linear and non-linear models, first for the standard case of\nnetworks with positive edges, before being generalized to the case of signed\nnetworks with both positive and negative interactions. We illustrate our\nresults with examples of both signed and unsigned graphs for consensus dynamics\nand for partial synchronization of oscillator networks under the master\nstability function as well as Kuramoto oscillators.\n", "  We study excitation transfer dynamics in a lattice of two level systems\ncharacterized by dynamic disorder. The diagonal and off-diagonal energy\ndisorders arise from the coupling of system and bath. We consider both the same\nand the independent bath limits. In case of independent bath all diagonal and\noff-diagonal bath coupling elements fluctuate independently of each other and\nthe dynamics is complicated. We obtain the time dependent population\ndistribution by solving quantum stochastic Liouville equation (QSLE) derived by\nKubo. The main result of our study is both the population transfer dynamics and\nthe mean square displacement of the exciton behave the similar way in the same\nand independent bath cases in the Markovian limit. However, these two baths can\ngive rise to markedly different behavior in the non-Markovian limit where\ncoherent transport becomes important. There are also several additional new\nresults as follows. (i) Exciton migration remains coherent all the time for an\naverage, non-zero off-diagonal coupling value J for the same bath case while it\nbecomes incoherent for independent bath case in the Markovian limit. (ii) An\noscillatory behavior of the population transfer dynamics supports the coherent\nmode of transfer of exciton. (iii) Agreement with available analytical\nexpression of mean squared displacement is good in the Markovian limit for\nindependent bath case with off-diagonal fluctuation but only qualitative in the\nnon-Markovian limit for which no complete analytical solution is available.\n(iv) Transition from coherent to incoherent transport is observed in the\nindependent bath case with diagonal fluctuation when the bath is made\nprogressively more Markovian. (v) The correlation time of the bath plays a\nunique role in dictating the diffusive spread that is not anticipated in a\nMarkovian treatment.\n", "  We give a simple proof of the exponential de Finetti theorem due to Renner.\nLike Renner's proof, ours combines the post-selection de Finetti theorem, the\nGentle Measurement lemma, and the Chernoff bound, but avoids virtually all\ncalculations, including any use of the theory of types.\n", "  We review the potential of precise measurements of electromagnetic probes in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions for the theoretical understanding of strongly\ninteracting matter. The penetrating nature of photons and dileptons implies\nthat they can carry undistorted information about the hot and dense regions of\nthe fireballs formed in these reactions and thus provide a unique opportunity\nto measure the electromagnetic spectral function of QCD matter as a function of\nboth invariant mass and momentum. In particular we report on recent progress on\nhow the medium modifications of the (dominant) isovector part of the vector\ncurrent correlator ($\\rho$ channel) can shed light on the mechanism of chiral\nsymmetry restoration in the hot and/or dense environment. In addition, thermal\ndilepton radiation enables novel access to (a) the fireball lifetime through\nthe dilepton yield in the low invariant-mass window $0.3 \\; \\mathrm{GeV} \\leq M\n\\leq 0.7 \\; \\mathrm{GeV}$, and (b) the early temperatures of the fireball\nthrough the slope of the invariant-mass spectrum in the intermediate-mass\nregion ($1.5 \\; \\mathrm{GeV} <M< 2.5 \\; \\mathrm{GeV}$). The investigation of\nthe pertinent excitation function suggests that the beam energies provided by\nthe NICA and FAIR projects are in a promising range for a potential discovery\nof the onset of a first order phase transition, as signaled by a non-monotonous\nbehavior of both low-mass yields and temperature slopes.\n", "  In original twin Higgs model, vacuum misalignment between electroweak and new\nphysics scales is realized by adding explicit $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking term.\nIntroducing additional twin Higgs could accommodate spontaneous $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nbreaking, which explains the origin of this misalignment. We introduce a class\nof two twin Higgs doublet models with most general scalar potential, and\ndiscuss general conditions which trigger electroweak and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry breaking. Various scenarios on realising the vacuum misalignment are\nsystematically discussed in a natural two Higgs double model framework:\nexplicit $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking, radiative $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking,\ntadpole-induced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking, and quartic-induced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nbreaking. We investigate the Higgs mass spectra and the Higgs phenomenology in\nthese scenarios.\n", "  Zero rest-mass fields of spin 1 (the electromagnetic field) and spin 2\npropagating on flat space and their corresponding Newman-Penrose (NP) constants\nare studied near spatial infinity. The aim of this analysis is to clarify the\ncorrespondence between data for these fields on a spacelike hypersurface and\nthe value of their corresponding NP constants at future and past null infinity.\nTo do so, the framework of the cylinder at spatial infinity is employed to show\nthat, expanding the initial data in terms spherical harmonics and powers of the\ngeodesic spatial distance $\\rho$ to spatial infinity, the NP constants\ncorrespond to the data for the highest possible spherical harmonic at fixed\norder in $\\rho$. In addition, it is shown that the NP constants at future and\npast null infinity, for both the Maxwell and spin-2 case, are related to each\nother as they arise from the same terms in the initial data. Moreover, it is\nshown that this observation is true for generic data (not necessarily\ntime-symmetric). This identification is a consequence of both the evolution and\nconstraint equations.\n", "  One of the defining properties of electrons is their mutual Coulombic\nrepulsion. In solids, however, this basic property may change. A famous example\nis that of superconductors, where coupling to lattice vibrations make electrons\nattract each other and leads to the formation of bound pairs. But what if all\ndegrees of freedom are electronic? Is it still possible to make electrons\nattractive via their repulsion from other electrons? Such a mechanism, termed\n'excitonic', was proposed fifty years ago by W. A. Little, aiming to achieve\nstronger and more exotic superconductivity, yet despite many experimental\nefforts, direct evidence for such 'excitonic' attraction is still lacking.\nHere, we demonstrate this unique attraction by constructing, from the bottom\nup, the fundamental building block of this mechanism. Our experiments are based\non quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic\nprecision manipulation. Using this platform we demonstrate that two electrons\ncan be made to attract using an independent electronic system as the binding\nglue. Owing to its large tunability, our system offers crucial insights into\nthe underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent attraction on\nthe underlying repulsion and the origin of the pairing energy. We also\ndemonstrate transport signatures of 'excitonic' pairing. This experimental\ndemonstration of 'excitonic' pairing paves the way for the design of exotic\nstates of matter.\n", "  Let $L^2$ be the Lebesgue space of square-integrable functions on the unit\ncircle. We show that the injectivity problem for Toeplitz operators is linked\nto the existence of geodesics in the Grassmann manifold of $L^2$. We also\ninvestigate this connection in the context of restricted Grassmann manifolds\nassociated to $p$-Schatten ideals and essentially commuting projections.\n", "  A fundamental problem in applying machine learning techniques for chemical\nproblems is to find suitable representations for molecular and crystal\nstructures. While the structure representations based on atom connectivities\nare prevalent for molecules, two-dimensional descriptors are not suitable for\ndescribing molecular crystals. In this work, we introduce the SFC-M family of\nfeature representations, which are based on Morton space-filling curves, as an\nalternative means of representing crystal structures. Latent Semantic Indexing\n(LSI) was employed in a novel setting to reduce sparsity of feature\nrepresentations. The quality of the SFC-M representations were assessed by\nusing them in combination with artificial neural networks to predict Density\nFunctional Theory (DFT) single point, Ewald summed, lattice, and many-body\ndispersion energies of 839 organic molecular crystal unit cells from the\nCambridge Structural Database that consist of the elements C, H, N, and O.\nPromising initial results suggest that the SFC-M representations merit further\nexploration to improve its ability to predict solid-state properties of organic\ncrystal structures\n", "  We study the pages in Albert Einstein's 1916 landmark paper in the Annalen\nder Physik where he derived his field equations for gravity. Einstein made two\nheuristic and physically insightful steps. The first was to obtain the field\nequations in vacuum in a rather geometric fashion. The second step was\nobtaining the field equations in the presence of matter from the field\nequations in vacuum. (This transition is an essential principle in physics,\nmuch as the principle of local gauge invariance in quantum field theory.) To\nthis end, we go over some quick differential geometric background related to\ncurvilinear coordinates, vectors, tensors, metric tensor, Christoffel symbols,\nRiemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and see how Einstein used geometry to\nmodel gravity.\n", "  Previous work developed a K-matrix formalism applicable to positive energies\nfor the scattering between two $s$-wave interacting particles with two internal\nstates, isotropic spin-orbit coupling and vanishing center-of-mass momentum [H.\nDuan, L. You and B. Gao, Phys. Rev A {\\bf{87}}, 052708 (2013)]. This work\nextends the formalism to the entire energy regime. Explicit solutions are\nobtained for the total angular momentum $J=0$ and $1$ channels. The behavior of\nthe partial cross sections in the negative energy regime is analyzed in detail.\nWe find that the leading contributions to the partial cross sections at the\nnegative energy thresholds are governed by the spin-orbit coupling strength\n$k_{\\text{so}}$ and the mass ratio. The fact that these contributions are\nindependent of the two-body scattering length $a_s$ is a direct consequence of\nthe effective reduction of the dimensionality, and hence of the density of\nstates, near the scattering thresholds due to the single-particle spin-orbit\ncoupling terms. The results are analytically continued to the energy regime\nwhere bound states exist. It is shown that our results are consistent with\nresults obtained by alternative approaches. Our formulation, which can be\nregarded as an extension of the standard textbook partial wave decomposition,\ncan be generalized to two-body systems with other types of spin-orbit coupling,\nincluding cases where the center-of-mass momentum does not vanish.\n", "  In this work, we developed an improved shear lag model to investigate the\nload transfer characteristics of three-phase nanocomposite which is reinforced\nwith microscale fibers augmented with carbon nanotubes on their circumferential\nsurfaces. The shear lag model accounts for (i) radial and axial deformations of\ndifferent transversely isotropic constituents, (ii) thermomechanical loads on\nthe representative volume element (RVE), and (iii) staggering effect of\nadjacent RVEs. The results from the current newly developed shear lag model are\nvalidated with the finite element simulations and found to be in good\nagreement. Our study reveals that the reduction in the maximum value of the\naxial stress in the fiber and the interfacial shear stress along its length\nbecome more pronounced in the presence of applied thermomechanical loads on the\nstaggered RVEs. The existence of shear tractions along the RVE length plays a\nsignificant role in the load transfer characteristics and cannot be ignored.\n", "  For the symmetric harmonic oscillator and the symmetric bouncer defined in\n2-D, two different Hamiltonian are given describing the same classical\ndynamics; however, their quantum dynamics behavior are different.\n", "  We are at a stage in our evolution where we do not yet know if we will ever\ncommunicate with intelligent beings that have evolved on other planets, yet we\nare intelligent and curious enough to wonder about this. We find ourselves\nwondering about this at the very beginning of a long era in which stellar\nluminosity warms many planets, and by our best models, continues to provide\nequally good opportunities for intelligent life to evolve. By simple Bayesian\nreasoning, if, as we believe, intelligent life forms have the same propensity\nto evolve later on other planets as we had to evolve on ours, it follows that\nthey will likely not pass through a similar wondering stage in their evolution.\nThis suggests that the future holds some kind of interstellar communication\nthat will serve to inform newly evolved intelligent life forms that they are\nnot alone before they become curious.\n", "  In his recent paper \"QBism, FAPP and the Quantum Omelette\" [1608.00548v1] de\nRonde makes a variety of questionable claims concerning QBism, Bohr, and the\npresent author's critical appraisal of QBism [1409.3312v1]. These claims are\nexamined. Subsequently an outline is presented of what one might see if one\nlooks into the quantum domain through the window provided by the\nquantum-mechanical correlations between outcome-indicating events in the\nclassical domain.\n", "  We study phase behaviours of lipid--bilayer vesicles functionalised by\nligand--receptor complexes made of synthetic DNA by introducing a modelling\nframework and a dedicated experimental platform. In particular, we perform\nMonte Carlo simulations that combine a coarse grained description of the lipid\nbilayer with state of art analytical models for multivalent ligand--receptor\ninteractions. Using density of state calculations, we derive the partition\nfunction in pairs of vesicles and compute the number of ligand--receptor bonds\nas a function of temperature. Numerical results are compared to microscopy and\nfluorimetry experiments on Large Unilamellar Vesicles decorated by DNA linkers\ncarrying complementary overhangs. We find that vesicle aggregation is\nsuppressed when the total number of linkers falls below a threshold value.\nWithin the model proposed here, this is due to the higher configurational costs\nrequired to form inter--vesicle bridges as compared to intra-vesicle loops,\nwhich are in turn related to membrane deformability. Our findings and our\nnumerical/experimental methodologies are applicable to the rational design of\nliposomes used as functional materials and drug delivery applications, as well\nas to study inter-membrane interactions in living systems, such as cell\nadhesion.\n", "  Toroidal drift waves with unconventional mode structures and non-ground\neigenstates, which differ from typical ballooning structure mode, are found to\nbe important recently by large scale global gyrokinetic simulations and\nespecially become dominant at strong gradient edge plasmas [cf., Xie and Xiao,\nPhys. Plasmas, 22, 090703 (2015)]. The global stability and mode structures of\ndrift wave in this steep edge density and temperature gradients are examined by\nboth direct numerical solutions of a model two-dimensional eigen equation and\nanalytical theory employing WKB-ballooning approach. Theory agrees with\nnumerical solutions quite well. Our results indicate that (i) non-ground\neigenstates and unconventional mode structures generally exist and can be\nroughly described by two parameters `quantum number' $l$ and ballooning angle\n$\\vartheta_k$, (ii) local model can overestimate the growth rate largely, say,\n$>50\\%$, and (iii) the narrow steep equilibrium profile leads to twisting\n(triangle-like) radial mode structures. With velocity space integral,\nsemi-local theory predicts that the critical jump gradient of the most unstable\nion temperature gradient mode from ground state $l=0$ to non-ground state $l=1$\nis $L_T^{-1}R\\sim50$. These features can have important consequences to\nturbulent transport.\n", "  We analysed solar-like oscillations in 1523 $\\textit{Kepler}$ red giants\nwhich have previously been misclassified as subgiants, with predicted $\\nu_{\\rm\nmax}$ values (based on the Kepler Input Catalogue) between 280$\\mu$Hz to\n700$\\mu$Hz. We report the discovery of 626 new oscillating red giants in our\nsample, in addition to 897 oscillators that were previously characterized by\nHekker et al. (2011) from one quarter of $\\textit{Kepler}$ data. Our sample\nincreases the known number of oscillating low-luminosity red giants by $26\\%$\n(up to $\\sim$ 1900 stars). About three quarters of our sample are classified as\nascending red-giant-branch stars, while the remainder are red-clump stars. A\nnovel scheme was applied to determine $\\Delta \\nu$ for 108 stars with $\\nu_{\\rm\nmax}$ close to the Nyquist frequency (240$\\mu$Hz < $\\nu_{\\rm max}$ <\n320$\\mu$Hz). Additionally, we identified 47 stars oscillating in the\nsuper-Nyquist frequency regime, up to 387$\\mu$Hz, using long-cadence light\ncurves. We show that the misclassifications are most likely due to large\nuncertainties in KIC surface gravities, and do not result from the absence of\nbroadband colors or from different physical properties such as reddening,\nspatial distribution, mass or metallicity. The sample will be valuable to study\noscillations in low-luminosity red giants and to characterize planet candidates\naround those stars.\n", "  Galilean transformation properties of different physical quantities are\ninvestigated from the point of view of four dimensional Galilean relativistic\n(non-relativistic) space-time. The objectivity of balance equations of general\nheat conducting fluids and of the related physical quantities is treated as an\napplication.\n", "  We study the transmission phase shift across a Kondo correlated quantum dot\nin a GaAs heterostructure at temperatures below the Kondo temperature ($T <\nT_{\\rm K}$), where the phase shift is expected to show a plateau at $\\pi/2$ for\nan ideal Kondo singlet ground state. Our device is tuned such that the ratio\n$\\Gamma/U$ of level width $\\Gamma$ to charging energy $U$ is quite large\n($\\lesssim 0.5$ rather than $\\ll 1$). This situation is commonly used in GaAs\nquantum dots to ensure Kondo temperatures large enough ($\\simeq 100$ mK here)\nto be experimentally accessible; however it also implies that charge\nfluctuations are more pronounced than typically assumed in theoretical studies\nfocusing on the regime $\\Gamma/U \\ll 1$ needed to ensure a well-defined local\nmoment. Our measured phase evolves monotonically by $\\pi$ across the two\nCoulomb peaks, but without being locked at $\\pi/2$ in the Kondo valley for $T\n\\ll T_{\\rm K}$, due to a significant influence of large $\\Gamma/U$. Only when\n$\\Gamma/U$ is reduced sufficiently does the phase start to be locked around\n$\\pi/2$ and develops into a plateau at $\\pi/2$. Our observations are consistent\nwith numerical renormalization group calculations, and can be understood as a\ndirect consequence of the Friedel sum rule that relates the transmission phase\nshift to the local occupancy of the dot, and thermal average of a transmission\ncoefficient through a resonance level near the Fermi energy.\n", "  Sand ripples are commonly observed in both nature and industry. For example,\nthey are found on riverbeds and in oil pipelines that transport sand. In both\nnatural and industrial cases, ripples increase friction between the bed and\nfluid and are related to flooding, high pressure drops, and transients. Ripples\nappear when sediments are entrained as bed load (a mobile granular layer) and\nare usually considered to be the result of initial bedforms that eventually\nsaturate. Given the small aspect ratio of the initial bedforms, linear analyses\ncan be used to understand the formation of ripples. This paper presents a\nlinear stability analysis of a granular bed under a turbulent flow of a liquid.\nThis analysis takes into consideration all the main mechanisms and parameters\ninvolved in the turbulent liquid case, including some important parameters that\nhave not yet been considered together such as the bed compactness and the\nbed-load threshold shear stress. The results of this analysis are compared with\npublished experimental results and they show good agreement.\n", "  The effects of plateau width and step edge kinking on carbon monoxide\n(CO)-induced restructuring of platinum surfaces were explored using molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations. Platinum crystals displaying four different vicinal\nsurfaces [(321), (765), (112), and (557)] were constructed and exposed to\npartial coverages of carbon monoxide. Platinum-CO interactions were fit to\nrecent experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations,\nproviding a classical interaction model that captures the atop binding\npreference on Pt. The differences in Pt-Pt binding strength between edge atoms\non the various facets were found to play a significant role in step edge\nwandering and reconstruction events. Because the mechanism for step doubling\nrelies on a stochastic meeting of two wandering edges, the widths of the\nplateaus on the original surfaces was also found to play a role in these\nreconstructions. On the Pt(321) surfaces, the CO adsorbate was found to assist\nin reordering the kinked step edges into straight {100} edge segments.\n", "  Coherent spin transport through bilayer graphene (BLG) nanoflakes sandwiched\nbetween two electrodes made of single-layer zigzag graphene nanoribbon was\ninvestigated by means of Landauer-Buttiker formalism. Application of a magnetic\nfield only on BLG structure as a channel produces a perfect spin polarization\nin a large energy region. Moreover, the conductance could be strongly modulated\nby magnetization of the zigzag edge of AB-stacked BLG, and the junction,\nentirely made of carbon, produces a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) up to\n$10^6\\%$. Intestinally, GMR and spin polarization could be tuned by varying BLG\nwidth and length. Generally, MR in a AB-stacked BLG strongly increases\n(decreases) with length (width).\n", "  We studied how the electron-electron (e-e) interaction enhances the strength\nof the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and opens the possibility of\ngenerating a spin-polarized output current from an unpolarized electric current\nwithout any magnetic elements. In this regard, we proposed a novel design of a\ngraphene-like junction based on the $e$-$e$ interaction and the $RSOC$. The\nresults showed that the $e$-$e$ interaction with $RSOC$ opens a spin energy gap\nand extremely enhances the $RSOC$ in this spin energy gap. Interestingly, the\njunction produces a large spin-polarized current and could act as a\nhigh-efficiency spin filter device (nearly 100\\% spin polarization) at room\ntemperature even at low Rashba and e-e interaction strengths. However, with an\nappropriate design, we showed that RSOC could strongly weaken the\nspin-polarized current and the spin energy gap, which is solely produced by the\n$e$-$e$ interaction, but a high spin polarization persists in some energy\nranges.\n", "  We investigate a model of an asymmetric bilayer consisting of sphigomyelin,\nphosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol in the outer leaflet, and\nphosphatidyl\\-ethanolamine, (PE), phosphatidylserine, and cholesterol in the\ninner leaflet. Composition fluctuations are coupled to membrane fluctuations\nvia the bending energy which depends upon the local spontaneous curvature\ndominated by the PE in the inner leaflet. This brings about a microemulsion in\nthat leaflet with a characteristic wavelength of 37 nm as shown by the PE-PE\nstructure function. Thus the inner leaflet will respond to an external\nperturbation most strongly at this length. However the correlation length is\napproximately 1 nm so that composition variations are not seen in the inner\nleaflet itself. Depending upon the strength of the coupling between leaflets,\nthe outer leaflet is either a normal fluid or is also a microemulsion. In this\nmodel then, the lipids of the plasma membrane would not evince inhomogeneities,\nbut would be primed to create them from the inner leaflet in response to\nnon-lipid perturbations.\n", "  The addition of wealth-attained advantage (WAA) to the Yard-Sale Model (YSM)\nof asset exchange has been demonstrated to induce wealth condensation. In a\nmodel of WAA for which the bias is a continuous function of the wealth\ndifference of the transacting agents, the condensation was shown to arise from\na second-order phase transition to a coexistence regime. In this paper, we\npresent the first analytic time-dependent results for this model, by showing\nthat the condensed wealth obeys a logistic equation in time.\n", "  Recently, simple dynamical systems such as the 1-d maps on the interval,\ngained significant attention in the context of statistical physics and complex\nsystems. The decay of correlations in these systems, can be characterized and\nmeasured by correlation functions. In the context of symbolic dynamics of the\nnon-chaotic multifractal attractors (i.e. Feigenbaum attractors), one\nobservable, the symbol-to-symbol correlation function, for the generating\npartition of the logistic map, is rigorously introduced and checked with\nnumerical experiments. Thanks to the Metropolis-Stein-Stein (MSS) algorithm\nthis observable can be calculated analytically, giving predictions in absolute\naccordance with numerical computations. The deep, algorithmic structure of the\nobservable is revealed clearly reflecting the complexity of the multifractal\nattractor.\n", "  The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a precise model of electroweak\ninteractions, however there is growing tension between the SM and observations\n(neutrino oscillations, dark matter, dark energy, baryogenesis, among others).\nThere is no reason to expect the validity of the ad hoc SM to remain intact at\nenergy scales above a few TeV, thus a more fundamental theory will almost\ncertainly be required.\n  Motivated by these considerations, we investigate a Supersymmetric version of\na natural extension of the SM, the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model, that is obtained by\ngauging the accidental B-L symmetry that exists in the ordinary SM. The\nSupersymmetric $U(1)_{B-L}$ extended SM can resolve the neutrino mass problem,\nthe dark matter problem, the hierarchy problem, and provides a mechanism for\nestablishing the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe.\n  When we include quantum corrections to the Higgs potential of the model, we\nfind that Radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking occurs through the interplay\nbetween large Majorana Yukawa couplings and SUSY breaking masses, and the SM\nneutrino masses arise through the Type-I seesaw mechanism. We deduce from the\nform RGEs that $B-L$ will be broken near the TeV scale when the Majorana Yukawa\ncouplings are of order 0.5, leading to TeV scale right-handed neutrinos, which\ncould be accessible at the LHC. We discuss the different vacua of the theory\nand the viability of a right-handed neutrino dark matter candidate in the\nR-parity conserving and violating sectors. A new $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity is\npostulated in the R-parity violating sector in which case the lightest right\nhanded neutrino becomes a viable Dark Matter candidate in addition to the\ngravitino.\n", "  Aluminum oxide thin films were deposited on silicon substrates under\ndifferent deposition conditions using pulse pressure metal organic chemical\nvapour deposition (PP-MOCVD). The current study investigates into the growth\nmechanism of the deposited film and the control of the film morphology by\nvarying the processing parameters of PP-MOCVD - choice of solvent,\nconcentration, and presence of a shield. Aluminum sec-butoxide (ASB) was used\nas the aluminum source while hexane and toluene were used as the solvents. The\nfilms were deposited at 475oC at different precursor concentrations. It was\nobserved that the choice of solvent has no effect on the surface morphology,\nbut it influenced the deposition rate. The improved deposition rate, relatively\nclose enthalpy of vaporisation ({\\Delta}H) values and uniformity of the film,\nirrespective of the growth conditions, showed that hexane was a better solvent\nfor ASB than toluene. A hybrid mode of vapour deposition and vapour\ncondensation model for thin film growth is proposed where five different\nmechanisms lead to a solid film formation. These include vapour phase\ndeposition under low arrival rate, vapour phase deposition under high arrival\nrate, Leidenfrost aerosol formation, heterogeneous particle formation and\nliquid droplet impingement. The important parameter that needs to be controlled\nis the precursor flux arrival rate which can be controlled by varying the\nprecursor concentration, use of a solvent with a low {\\Delta}H and the presence\nof a shield over the substrate, which influences the surface morphology and the\ngrowth rate of the films.\n", "  We show that suppression of vortex strings splits the order-disorder\ntransition in the three-state Potts ferromagnet on a simple cubic lattice and\nopens up an intermediate phase characterized by partial breaking of the\nthree-fold symmetry and long-range order. In contrast, suppression of vortices\nin the same model on a square lattice results in an intermediate phase with\nenhanced U(1) symmetry and quasi-long-range order. We show that the difference\nbetween the two phases originates from distinct patterns of domain wall\nproliferation. A domain wall, separating the two most populous spin states,\npercolates on its own in the former phase but remains at a percolation\nthreshold in the latter.\n", "  Many research works deal with chaotic neural networks for various fields of\napplication. Unfortunately, up to now these networks are usually claimed to be\nchaotic without any mathematical proof. The purpose of this paper is to\nestablish, based on a rigorous theoretical framework, an equivalence between\nchaotic iterations according to Devaney and a particular class of neural\nnetworks. On the one hand we show how to build such a network, on the other\nhand we provide a method to check if a neural network is a chaotic one.\nFinally, the ability of classical feedforward multilayer perceptrons to learn\nsets of data obtained from a dynamical system is regarded. Various Boolean\nfunctions are iterated on finite states. Iterations of some of them are proven\nto be chaotic as it is defined by Devaney. In that context, important\ndifferences occur in the training process, establishing with various neural\nnetworks that chaotic behaviors are far more difficult to learn.\n", "  Chaotic iterations, a tool formerly used in distributed computing, has\nrecently revealed various interesting properties of disorder leading to its use\nin the computer science security field. In this paper, a comprehensive study of\nits topological behavior is proposed. It is stated that, in addition to being\nchaotic as defined in the Devaney's formulation, this tool possesses the\nproperty of topological mixing. Additionally, its level of sensibility,\nexpansivity, and topological entropy are evaluated. All of these properties\nlead to a complete unpredictable behavior for the chaotic iterations. As it\nonly manipulates binary digits or integers, we show that it is possible to use\nit to produce truly chaotic computer programs. As an application example, a\ntruly chaotic hash function is proposed in two versions. In the second version,\nan artificial neural network is used, which can be stated as chaotic according\nto Devaney.\n", "  Lots of researches indicate that the inefficient generation of random numbers\nis a significant bottleneck for information communication applications.\nTherefore, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is developed to process a\nscalable fixed-point method for random streams generation. In our previous\nresearches, we have proposed a technique by applying some well-defined discrete\nchaotic iterations that satisfy the reputed Devaney's definition of chaos,\nnamely chaotic iterations (CI). We have formerly proven that the generator with\nCI can provide qualified chaotic random numbers. In this paper, this generator\nbased on chaotic iterations is optimally redesigned for FPGA device. By doing\nso, the generation rate can be largely improved. Analyses show that these\nhardware generators can also provide good statistical chaotic random bits and\ncan be cryptographically secure too. An application in the information hiding\nsecurity field is finally given as an illustrative example.\n", "  We revisit the discussion of the energetics of quasi-geostrophic flows from a\ngeometric perspective based on the introduction of an effective metric, built\nin terms of the flow stratification and the Coriolis parameter. In particular,\nan appropriate notion of normal modes is defined through a spectral geometry\nproblem in the ocean basin (a compact manifold with boundary) for the\nassociated Laplace-Beltrami scalar operator. This spectral problem can be used\nto systematically encode non-local aspects of stratification and topography. As\nexamples of applications we revisit the isotropy assumption in geostrophic\nturbulence, identify (a patch of) the hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^3$ as the\nleading-order term in the effective geometry for the deep mesoscale ocean and,\nfinally, discuss some diagnostic tools based on a simple statistical mechanics\ntoy-model to be used in numerical simulations and/or observations of\nquasi-geostrophic flows.\n", "  In the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, inhomogeneous models are usually\nquantized by means of a hybrid approach that combines loop quantization\ntechniques with standard quantum field theory methods. This approach is based\non a splitting of the phase space in a homogeneous sector, formed by global,\nzero-modes, and an inhomogeneous sector, formed by the remaining, infinite\nnumber of modes, that describe the local degrees of freedom. Then, the hybrid\nquantization is attained by adopting a loop representation for the homogeneous\ngravitational sector, while a Fock representation is used for the\ninhomogeneities. The zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint operator couples\nthe homogeneous and inhomogeneous sectors. The hybrid approach, therefore, is\nexpected to provide a suitable quantum theory in regimes where the main quantum\neffects of the geometry are those affecting the zero-modes, while the\ninhomogeneities, still being quantum, can be treated in a more conventional\nway. This hybrid strategy was first proposed for the simplest cosmological\nmidisuperspaces: the Gowdy models, and it has been later applied to the case of\ncosmological perturbations. This paper reviews the construction and main\napplications of hybrid Loop Quantum Cosmology\n", "  Although black holes are eminent manifestations of very strong gravity, the\ngeometry of space-time around and even inside them can be significantly\naffected by additional bodies present in their surroundings. We study such an\ninfluence within static and axially symmetric (electro-)vacuum space-times\ndescribed by exact solutions of Einstein's equations, considering\nastrophysically motivated configurations (such as black holes surrounded by\nrings) as well as those of pure academic interest (such as specifically \"tuned\"\nsystems of multiple black holes). The geometry is represented by the simplest\ninvariants determined by the metric (the lapse function) and its gradient\n(gravitational acceleration), with special emphasis given to curvature (the\nKretschmann and Ricci-square scalars). These quantities are analyzed and their\nlevel surfaces plotted both above and below the black-hole horizons, in\nparticular near the central singularities. Estimating that the black hole could\nbe most strongly affected by the other black hole, we focus, in this first\npaper, on the Majumdar--Papapetrou solution for a binary black hole and compare\nthe deformation caused by \"the other\" hole (and the electrostatic field) with\nthat induced by rotational dragging in the well-known Kerr and Kerr--Newman\nsolutions.\n", "  Effective state transfer is one of the most important problems in quantum\ninformation processing. Typically, a quantum information device is composed of\nmany subsystems with multi-input ports. In this paper, we develop a general\ntheory describing the condition for perfect state transfer from the multi-input\nports to the internal system components, for general passive linear quantum\nsystems. The key notion used is the zero of the transfer function matrix.\nApplication to entanglement generation and distribution in a quantum network is\nalso discussed.\n", "  We continue to study the response of black-hole space-times on the presence\nof additional strong sources of gravity. Restricting ourselves to static and\naxially symmetric (electro-)vacuum exact solutions of Einstein's equations, we\nfirst considered the Majumdar--Papapetrou solution for a binary of extreme\nblack holes in a previous paper, while here we deal with a Schwarzschild black\nhole surrounded by a concentric thin ring described by the Bach--Weyl solution.\nThe geometry is again revealed on the simplest invariants determined by the\nmetric (lapse function) and its gradient (gravitational acceleration), and by\ncurvature (Kretschmann scalar). Extending the metric inside the black hole\nalong null geodesics tangent to the horizon, we mainly focus on the black-hole\ninterior (specifically, on its sections at constant Killing time) where the\nquantities behave in a way indicating a surprisingly strong influence of the\nexternal source. Being already distinct on the level of potential and\nacceleration, this is still more pronounced on the level of curvature: for a\nsufficiently massive and/or nearby (small) ring, the Kretschmann scalar even\nbecomes negative in certain toroidal regions mostly touching the horizon from\ninside. Such regions have been interpreted as those where magnetic-type\ncurvature dominates, but here we deal with space-times which do {\\em not}\ninvolve rotation and the negative value is achieved due to the {\\em\nelectric}-type components of the Riemann/Weyl tensor. The Kretschmann scalar\nalso shapes rather non-trivial landscapes {\\em outside} the horizon.\n", "  Black hole apparent horizons possess a natural notion of stability, whose\nspectral characterization can be related to the problem of the stationary\nquantum charged particle. Such mathematical relation leads to an \"analyticity\nconjecture\" on the dependence of the spectral properties on a complex\n\"fine-structure-constant\" parameter, that can reduce the study of the spectrum\nof the (non-selfadjoint) MOTS-stability operator to that of the (selfadjoint)\nHamiltonian of the quantum charged particle. Moreover, this perspective might\nopen an avenue to the spinorial treatment of apparent horizon (MOTS-)stability\nand to the introduction of semiclassical tools to explore some of the\nqualitative aspects of this black hole spectral problem.\n", "  In our paper we would like to make a cross-disciplinary leap and use the\ntools of network theory to understand and explore narrative structure in\nliterary fiction, an approach that is still underestimated. However, the\nsystems in fiction are sensitive to readers subjectivity and attention must to\nbe paid to different methods of extracting networks. The project aims at\ninvestigating into different ways social interactions are read in texts by\ncomparing networks produced by automated algorithms-natural language processing\nwith those created by surveying more subjective human responses. Conversation\nnetworks from fiction have been already extracted by scientists, but the more\ngeneral framework surrounding these interactions was missing. We propose\nseveral NLP methods for detecting interactions and test them against a range of\nhuman perceptions. In doing so, we have pointed to some limitations of using\nnetwork analysis to test literary theory, e.g. interaction, which corresponds\nto the plot, does not form climax.\n", "  Properties of cooperation's probability function in Prisoner`s Dilemma have\nimpact on evolution of game. Basic model defines that probability of\ncooperation depends linearly, both on the player's altruism and the co-player's\nreputation. I propose modification of activation function to smooth one\n(hyperbolic tangent with scaling parameter a, which corresponds to its shape)\nand observe three phases for different range of a. (1) For small a, strategies\nseem to randomly change in time and situation of mixed choices (one cooperates\nand second defects) dominate. (2) For medium a, players choose only one\nstrategy for given period of time (the common state can switch to opposite one\nwith some probability). (3) For large a, mixed strategy (once defect, once\ncooperate) is coexisting with common strategies and no change is allowed. I\nbelieve that proposed function characterizes better socio-economical phenomena\nand especially phase 1 and 2 contain most of human behavior.\n", "  Epitaxial III-V semiconductor heterostructures are key components in modern\nmicroelectronics, electro-optics and optoelectronics. With superior\nsemiconducting properties, halide perovskite materials are rising as promising\ncandidates for coherent heterostructure devices. In this report, spinodal\ndecomposition is proposed and experimentally implemented to produce epitaxial\ndouble heterostructures in halide perovskite system. Pristine epitaxial mixed\nhalide perovskites rods and films were synthesized via Van der Waals epitaxy by\nchemical vapor deposition method. At room temperature, photon was applied as a\nknob to regulate the kinetics of spinodal decomposition and classic coarsening.\nBy this approach, halide perovskite double heterostructures were created\ncarrying epitaxial interfaces and outstanding optical properties. Reduced\nFr\\\"ohlich electron-phonon coupling was discovered in coherent halide double\nheterostructure, which is hypothetically attributed to the classic phonon\nconfinement effect widely existing in III-V double heterostructures. The\nability to develop coherent double heterostructures in halide perovskites paves\nan avenue to exploring halide perovskite-based quantum wells and superlattices\nfor high-performance and low-cost optoelectronics, electro-optics and\nmicroelectronics.\n", "  An overview of the algorithm and a sampling of plasma applications of the\nimplicit, adaptive high order finite (spectral) element modeling framework,\nHiFi, is presented. The distinguishing capabilities of the HiFi code include\nadaptive spectral element spatial representation with flexible geometry, highly\nparallelizable implicit time advance, and general flux-source form of the\npartial differential equations and boundary conditions that can be implemented\nin its framework. Early algorithm development and extensive verification\nstudies of the two-dimensional version of the code, known as SEL, have been\npreviously described [A.H. Glasser & X.Z. Tang, Comp. Phys. Comm., 164 (2004);\nV.S. Lukin, Ph.D. thesis, Princeton University (2008)]. Here, substantial\nalgorithmic improvements and extensions are presented together with examples of\ntwo- and three- dimensional applications of the HiFi framework. These include a\nCartesian two-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic simulation of low\ndissipation magnetic reconnection in a large system, a two-dimensional\naxisymmetric simulation of self-similar compression of a magnetic plasma\nconfinement configuration, and a three-dimensional Hall MHD simulation of\nspheromak tilting and relaxation. Some planned efforts to further improve and\nexpand the capabilities of the HiFi modeling framework are discussed.\n", "  I first recall the last occasion of meeting the late Professor Yoichiro Nambu\nin a hospital in Osaka. I then present a brief introduction to the moonshine\nphenomenon in string theory which is under recent investigations.\n", "  AstroSat is a multi-wavelength astronomy satellite, launched on 2015\nSeptember 28. It carries a suite of scientific instruments for multi-wavelength\nobservations of astronomical sources. It is a major Indian effort in space\nastronomy and the context of AstroSat is examined in a historical perspective.\nThe Performance Verification phase of AstroSat has been completed and all\ninstruments are working flawlessly and as planned. Some brief highlights of the\nscientific results are also given here.\n", "  We derive an effective Hamiltonian that takes into account the quantum nature\nof phonons and models cooperative Jahn-Teller effect in the adiabatic regime\nand at strong electron-phonon coupling in one dimension. Our approach involves\nmapping a strong-coupling problem to a weak-coupling one by using a duality\ntransformation. Subsequently, a sixth-order perturbation theory is employed in\nthe polaronic frame of reference where the small parameter is inversely\n(directly) proportional to the coupling (adiabaticity). We study charge and\norbital order in ferromagnetic manganite chains and address the pronounced\nelectron-hole asymmetry in the observed phase diagram. In particular, at strong\ncoupling, we offer an explanation for the observed density dependence of the\nwavevector of charge modulation, i.e., wavevector is proportional to\n(independent of) electron density on the electron-doped (hole-doped) side of\nthe phase diagram of manganites. We also provide a picture for the charge and\norbital order at special fillings $ \\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{3}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$,\nand $ \\frac{1}{5}$; while focusing on the ordering controversy at fillings\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$, we find that Wigner-crystal arrangement is\npreferred over bi-stripe order.\n", "  We report a theoretical prediction of a new class of bulk and intrinsic\nquantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators La$X$ ($X$=Br, Cl, and I) via\nrelativistic first-principle calculations. We find that these systems are\ninnate long-ranged ferromagnets which, with the help of intrinsic spin-orbit\ncoupling, become QAH insulators. A low-energy multiband tight binding model is\ndeveloped to understand the origin of the QAH effect. Finally integer Chern\nnumber is obtained via Berry phase computation for each two-dimensional plane.\nThese materials have the added benefit of a sizable band gap of as large as\n$\\sim$ 25 meV, with the flexibility of enhancing it to above 75 meV via strain\nengineering. The synthesis of La$X$ materials will provide the impurity-free\nsingle crystals and thin-film QAH insulators for versatile experiments and\nfunctionalities.\n", "  Stabilizing superconductivity at high temperatures and elucidating its\nmechanism have long been major challenges of materials research in condensed\nmatter physics. Meanwhile, recent progress in nanostructuring offers\nunprecedented possibilities for designing novel functionalities. Above all,\nthin films of cuprate and iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit\nremarkably better superconducting characteristics (e.g. higher critical\ntemperatures) than in the bulk, but the underlying mechanism is still not\nunderstood. Solving microscopic models suitable for cuprates, here, we\ndemonstrate that at an interface between a Mott insulator and an overdoped\nnon-superconducting metal, the superconducting amplitude stays always pinned at\nthe optimum achieved in the bulk, independently of the carrier concentration in\nthe metal. This is in contrast to the dome-like dependence in bulk\nsuperconductors, but consistent with the astonishing independence of the\ncritical temperature from the carrier density x observed at interfaces of\nLa2CuO4 and La2-xSrxCuO4. We furthermore identify a self-organization mechanism\nas responsible for the pinning at the optimum amplitude: An emergent electronic\nstructure induced by interlayer phase separation eludes bulk phase separation\nand inhomogeneities that would kill superconductivity in the bulk. Thus,\ninterfaces provide an ideal tool to enhance and stabilize superconductivity.\nThis interfacial example opens up further ways of shaping superconductivity by\nsuppressing competing instabilities, with direct perspectives for designing\ndevices.\n", "  The dark rate of single electrons emitted from a metal cathode of the counter\ndepends upon a temperature. At cryogenic temperatures the dark rate measured\nwith bi-alkaline cathodes of PMT has been found to increase by lowering the\ntemperature of the detector. One of the possible interpretations of this effect\nsuggests the energy trapping mechanism from the conversion of Hidden Photons of\nCDM at the surface of a photocathode. The measurements are planned by using a\nMulti-Cathode Counter (MCC) with a copper and aluminum cathodes of 0.2 m2 at\ntemperatures from 300 K down to 220 K to spot the increase of cryogenic dark\nrate from Hidden Photons of CDM. The physical motivation and the description of\nthe experiment are presented.\n", "  We formulate uncertainty relations for arbitrary finite number of\nincompatible observables. Based on the sum of variances of the observables,\nboth Heisenberg-type and Schr\\\"{o}dinger-type uncertainty relations are\nprovided. These new lower bounds are stronger in most of the cases than the\nones derived from some existing inequalities. Detailed examples are presented.\n", "  The virial theorem is a nice property for the linear Schrodinger equation in\natomic and molecular physics as it gives an elegant ratio between the kinetic\nand potential energies and is useful in assessing the quality of numerically\ncomputed eigenvalues. If the governing equation is a nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation with power-law nonlinearity, then a similar ratio can be obtained but\nthere seems no way of getting any eigenvalue estimate. It is surprising as far\nas we are concerned that when the nonlinearity is either square-root or\nsaturable nonlinearity (not a power-law), one can develop a virial theorem and\neigenvalue estimate of nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations in R2 with\nsquare-root and saturable nonlinearity, respectively. Furthermore, we show here\nthat the eigenvalue estimate can be used to obtain the 2nd order term (which is\nof order $ln\\Gamma$) of the lower bound of the ground state energy as the\ncoefficient $\\Gamma$ of the nonlinear term tends to infinity.\n", "  Science has traditionally played an important role in sharing knowledge among\npeople. Particle Physics, with its large experiments, has shown that one not\nonly can share the knowledge among different cultures, but that one can also\nwork together to achieve this knowledge. The present article gives a few\nexamples where this has been possible among people that are sometimes in\nconflict situations.\n", "  We show that the Bohmian approach in terms of persisting particles that move\non continuous trajectories following a deterministic law can be literally\napplied to QFT. By means of the Dirac sea model -- exemplified in the electron\nsector of the standard model neglecting radiation -- we explain how starting\nfrom persisting particles, one is led to standard QFT employing creation and\nannihilation operators when tracking the dynamics with respect to a reference\nstate, the so-called vacuum. Since on the level of wave functions, both\nformalisms are mathematically equivalent, this proposal provides for an\nontology of QFT that includes a dynamics of individual processes, solves the\nmeasurement problem and explains the appearance of creation and annihilation\nevents.\n", "  There are two important statements regarding the Trautman-Bondi mass [1,8,5]\nat null infinity: one is the positivity [7,6], and the other is the Bondi mass\nloss formula [1], which are both global in nature. The positivity of the\nquasi-local mass can potentially lead to a local description at null infinity.\nThis is confirmed for the Vaidya spacetime in this note. We study the Wang-Yau\nquasi-local mass on surfaces of fixed size at the null infinity of the Vaidya\nspacetime. The optimal embedding equation is solved explicitly and the\nquasi-local mass is evaluated in terms of the mass aspect function of the\nVaidya spacetime.\n", "  The Orion Bar is the archetypal edge-on molecular cloud surface illuminated\nby strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. Owing to the close\ndistance to Orion (about 1,350 light-year), the effects of stellar feedback on\nthe parental cloud can be studied in detail. Visible-light observations of the\nBar(1) show that the transition between the hot ionised gas and the warm\nneutral atomic gas (the ionisation front) is spatially well separated from the\ntransition from atomic to molecular gas (the dissociation front): about 15\narcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun\ndistance). Static equilibrium models(2,3) used to interpret previous\nfar-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Bar(4,5,6)\n(typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud\nstructure consisting of dense clumps embedded in a lower density extended gas\ncomponent. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that\nallow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary\nmodel predictions(7,8,9), there is no appreciable offset between the peak of\nthe H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of\nthe observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO\ntransition zones are very close. These observations reveal a fragmented ridge\nof high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the\nmolecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been\ncompressed by a high-pressure wave that currently moves into the molecular\ncloud. The images demonstrate that dynamical and nonequilibrium effects are\nimportant for the cloud evolution.\n", "  Factors distorting the statistics of photocounts when acquiring objects with\nlow fluxes were considered here. Measurements of the Fano factor for existing\nCCD systems were conducted. The study allows one to conclude on the quality of\nthe CCD video signal processing channel. The optimal strategy for faint object\nobservations was suggested.\n", "  Extrusion is a widely used process for forming pastes into designed shapes,\nand is central to the manufacture of many industrial products. The extrusion\nthrough a square-entry die of a model paste of non-Brownian spheres suspended\nin a Newtonian fluid is investigated using discrete element simulations,\ncapturing individual particle contacts and hydrodynamic interactions. The\nsimulations reveal inhomogeneous velocity and stress distributions, originating\nin the inherent microstructure formed by the constituent particles. Such\nfeatures are shown to be relevant to generic paste extrusion behaviour, such as\ndie swell. The pressure drop across the extruder is correlated with the\nextrudate velocity using the Benbow-Bridgwater equation, with the empirical\nparameters being linked directly to particle properties such as surface\nfriction, and processing conditions such as extruder wall roughness. Our model\nand results bring recent advances in suspension rheology into an industrial\nsetting, laying foundations for future model development, paste formulation and\nextrusion design.\n", "  Indirect transitions of electrons in graphene and graphite are investigated\nby means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) with several\ndifferent incident photon energies and light polarizations. The theoretical\ncalculations of the indirect transition for graphene and graphite are compared\nwith the experimental measurements for highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite and a\nsingle-crystal of graphite. The dispersion relations for the transverse optical\n(TO) and the out-of-plane longitudinal acoustic (ZA) phonon modes of graphite\nand the TO phonon mode of graphene can be extracted from the inelastic ARPES\nintensity. We find that the TO phonon mode for $k$ points along the\n$\\Gamma$-$K$ and $K$-$M$-$K'$ directions in the Brillouin zone can be observed\nin the ARPES spectra of graphite and graphene by using a photon energy of about\n11.1 eV. The relevant mechanism in the ARPES process for this case is the\nresonant indirect transition. On the other hand, the ZA phonon mode of graphite\ncan be observed by using a photon energy of about 6.3 eV through a nonresonant\nindirect transition, while the ZA phonon mode of graphene within the same\nmechanism should not be observed.\n", "  We review long-baseline neutrino experiments in which neutrinos are detected\nafter traversing macroscopic distances. Over such distances neutrinos have been\nfound to oscillate among flavor states. Experiments with solar, atmospheric,\nreactor, and accelerator neutrinos have resulted in a coherent picture of\nneutrino masses and mixing of the three known flavor states. We will summarize\nthe current best knowledge of neutrino parameters and phenomenology with our\nfocus on the evolution of the experimental technique. We proceed from the first\nevidence produced by astrophysical neutrino sources to the current open\nquestions and the goals of future research.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to understand the global characteristics of the\nstellar populations in NGC 300. In particular, we focused our attention on\nsearching young star groups and study their hierarchical organization.\n  The research was conducted using archival point spread function fitting\nphotometry measured from images in multiple bands obtained with the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys of the Hubble Space Telescope. Using the path linkage\ncriterion, we cataloged young star groups and analyzed them from the\nobservation of individual stars in the galaxy NGC 300. We also built stellar\ndensity maps from the bluest stars and applied the SExtractor code to identify\noverdensities. By plotting isocontours over the density maps and comparing the\ntwo methods, we could infer and delineate the hierarchical structure of the\nblue population in the galaxy. For each region of a detected young star group,\nwe estimated the size and derived the radial surface density profiles for\nstellar populations of different color. A statistical decontamination of field\nstars was performed for each region. In this way it was possible to build the\ncolor-magnitude diagrams and compare them with theoretical evolutionary models.\nWe also constrained the present-day mass function per group by estimating a\nvalue for its slope.\n  The blue population in NGC 300 shows a hierarchical behavior in which the\nlarger and loosely distributed structures split into more compact and denser\nones over several density levels. We created a catalog of 1147 young star\ngroups in six fields of the galaxy NGC 300, in which we present their\nfundamental characteristics. The mean and the mode radius values obtained from\nthe size distribution are both 25 pc, in agreement with the value for the Local\nGroup and nearby galaxies. Additionally, we found an average PDMF slope that is\ncompatible with the Salpeter value.\n", "  We constrain the spectrum of two-dimensional unitary, compact conformal field\ntheories with central charge c > 1 using modular bootstrap. Upper bounds on the\ngap in the dimension of primary operators of any spin, as well as in the\ndimension of scalar primaries, are computed numerically as functions of the\ncentral charge using semi-definite programming. Our bounds refine those of\nHellerman and Friedan-Keller, and are in some cases saturated by known CFTs. In\nparticular, we show that unitary CFTs with c < 8 must admit relevant\ndeformations, and that a nontrivial bound on the gap of scalar primaries exists\nfor c < 25. We also study bounds on the dimension gap in the presence of twist\ngaps, bounds on the degeneracy of operators, and demonstrate how \"extremal\nspectra\" which maximize the degeneracy at the gap can be determined\nnumerically.\n", "  We introduce a method that can be used to evolve the topology of a network in\na way that preserves both the network's spectral as well as local structure.\nThis method is quite versatile in the sense that it can be used to evolve a\nnetwork's topology over any collection of the network's elements. This\nevolution preserves both the eigenvector centrality of these elements as well\nas the eigenvalues of the original network. Although this method is introduced\nas a tool to model network growth, we show it can also be used to compare the\ntopology of different networks where two networks are considered similar if\ntheir evolved topologies are the same. Because this method preserves the\nspectral structure of a network, which is related to the network's dynamics, it\ncan also be used to study the interplay of network growth and function. We show\nthat if a network's dynamics is intrinsically stable, which is a stronger\nversion of the standard notion of stability, then the network remains\nintrinsically stable as the network's topology evolves. This is of interest\nsince the growth of a network can have a destabilizing effect on the network's\ndynamics, in general. In this sense the methods developed here can be used as a\ntool for designing mechanisms of network growth that ensure a network remains\nstabile as it grows.\n", "  With the availability of more powerful computing processors, iterative\nreconstruction algorithms have recently been successfully implemented as an\napproach to achieving significant dose reduction in X-ray CT. In this report,\nwe describe our proposal of an adaptive iterative reconstruction algorithm for\nX-ray CT, that is shown to provide results comparable to those obtained by\nproprietary algorithms, both in terms of reconstruction accuracy and execution\ntime. Implementation code in the C language is provided, along with example of\nuser interface.\n", "  The variability of wind-generated electricity can be reduced by aggregating\nthe outputs of wind generation plants spread over a large geographic area. In\nthis chapter we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to investigate upper bounds on\nthe degree of achievable smoothing and clarify how the degree of smoothing\ndepends on the number of plants and on the size of the geographic area over\nwhich they are spread.\n", "  Granular media are frequently found in nature and in industry and their\ntransport by a fluid flow is of great importance to human activities. One case\nof particular interest is the transport of sand in open-channel and river\nflows. In many instances, the shear stresses exerted by the fluid flow are\nbounded to certain limits and some grains are entrained as bed-load: a mobile\nlayer which stays in contact with the fixed part of the granular bed. Under\nthese conditions, an initially flat granular bed may be unstable, generating\nripples and dunes such as those observed on the bed of rivers. In free-surface\nwater flows, dunes are bedforms that scale with the flow depth, while ripples\ndo not scale with it. This article presents a model for the formation of\nripples and dunes based on the proposition that ripples are primary linear\ninstabilities and that dunes are secondary instabilities formed from the\ncompetition between the coalescence of ripples and free surface effects.\nAlthough simple, the model is able to explain the growth of ripples, their\nsaturation (not explained in previous models) and the evolution from ripples to\ndunes, presenting a complete picture for the formation of dunes.\n", "  We present an overview of the 'ICE' hardware and software framework that\nimplements large arrays of interconnected FPGA-based data acquisition, signal\nprocessing and networking nodes economically. The system was conceived for\napplication to radio, millimeter and sub-millimeter telescope readout systems\nthat have requirements beyond typical off-the-shelf processing systems, such as\ncareful control of interference signals produced by the digital electronics,\nand clocking of all elements in the system from a single precise\nobservatory-derived oscillator. A new generation of telescopes operating at\nthese frequency bands and designed with a vastly increased emphasis on digital\nsignal processing to support their detector multiplexing technology or\nhigh-bandwidth correlators---data rates exceeding a terabyte per second---are\nbecoming common. The ICE system is built around a custom FPGA motherboard that\nmakes use of an Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA and ARM-based co-processor. The system is\nspecialized for specific applications through software, firmware, and custom\nmezzanine daughter boards that interface to the FPGA through the\nindustry-standard FMC specifications. For high density applications, the\nmotherboards are packaged in 16-slot crates with ICE backplanes that implement\na low-cost passive full-mesh network between the motherboards in a crate, allow\nhigh bandwidth interconnection between crates, and enable data offload to a\ncomputer cluster. A Python-based control software library automatically detects\nand operates the hardware in the array. Examples of specific telescope\napplications of the ICE framework are presented, namely the\nfrequency-multiplexed bolometer readout systems used for the SPT and Simons\nArray and the digitizer, F-engine, and networking engine for the CHIME and\nHIRAX radio interferometers.\n", "  In this work a new family of black hole solutions in Lovelock gravity is\ndiscussed. These solutions describe anisotropic fluids which extend to the\nspatial infinity. Though far from the horizon their geometries approach some\npreviously known black holes solutions the location of the horizons differ.\nFurthemore, although the masses of these solutions match the masses of those\npreviously known black holes, their temperatures and entropies differ.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the effects of shielding on the internal\nquality factors (Qi) of Al and TiN microwave resonators designed for use in\nquantum coherent circuits. Measurements were performed in an adiabatic\ndemagnetization refrigerator, where typical magnetic fields of 200 {\\mu}T are\npresent at the unshielded sample stage. Radiation shielding consisted of 100 mK\nand 500 mK Cu cans coated with infrared absorbing epoxy. Magnetic shields\nconsisted of Cryoperm 10 and Sn plating of the Cu cans. A 2.7 K radiation can\nand coaxial thermalization filters were present in all measurements. TiN\nsamples with Qi = $1.3*10^6$ at 100 mK exhibited no significant variation in\nquality factor when tested with limited shielding. In contrast, Al resonators\nshowed improved Qi with successive shielding, with the largest gains obtained\nfrom the addition of the first radiation and magnetic shields and saturating\nbefore the addition of Sn plating infrared absorbing epoxy.\n", "  The \"principle of the fermionic projector\" provides a new mathematical\nframework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approach\nfor physics beyond the standard model. The book begins with a brief review of\nrelativity, relativistic quantum mechanics and classical gauge theories, with\nthe emphasis on the basic physical concepts and the mathematical foundations.\nThe external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved\nby introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time\nwhich generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the\nbook is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ\nmethods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The\nfermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational\nprinciples in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the\ncorresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed. A particular variational\nprinciple is proposed which gives rise to an effective interaction showing many\nsimilarities to the interactions of the standard model.\n  The main chapters of the book are easily accessible for beginning graduate\nstudents in mathematics or physics. Several appendices provide supplementary\nmaterial which will be useful to the experienced researcher.\n", "  The \"principle of the fermionic projector\" provides a new mathematical\nframework for the formulation of physical theories and is a promising approach\nfor physics beyond the standard model.
