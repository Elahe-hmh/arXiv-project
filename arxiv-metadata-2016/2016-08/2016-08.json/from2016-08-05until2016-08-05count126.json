These\nmeasurements reveal that the presence of non-magnetic dopants has a profound\neffect on the unconventional spin-Peierls behavior of this system, even at\nconcentrations as low as 1%. Sc-doping suppresses commensurate fluctuations in\nthe pseudogap and incommensurate spin-Peierls phases of TiOCl, and prevents the\nformation of a long-range ordered spin-Peierls state. Broad incommensurate\nscattering develops in the doped compounds near Tc2 ~ 93 K, and persists down\nto base temperature (~ 7 K) with no evidence of a lock-in transition. The width\nof the incommensurate dimerization peaks indicates short correlation lengths on\nthe order of ~ 12 angstroms below Tc2. The intensity of the incommensurate\nscattering is significantly reduced at higher Sc concentrations, indicating\nthat the size of the associated lattice displacement decreases rapidly as a\nfunction of doping.\n", "  Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies have been carried out on the\npyrochlore magnet Ho2Ti2O7. Measurements in zero applied magnetic field show\nthat the disordered spin ice ground state of Ho2Ti2O7 is characterized by a\npattern of rectangular diffuse elastic scattering within the [HHL] plane of\nreciprocal space, which closely resembles the zone boundary scattering seen in\nits sister compound Dy2Ti2O7. Well-defined peaks in the zone boundary\nscattering develop only within the spin ice ground state below ~ 2 K. In\ncontrast, the overall diffuse scattering pattern evolves on a much higher\ntemperature scale of ~ 17 K. The diffuse scattering at small wavevectors below\n[001] is found to vanish on going to Q=0, an explicit signature of expectations\nfor dipolar spin ice. Very high energy-resolution inelastic measurements reveal\nthat the spin ice ground state below ~ 2 K is also characterized by a\ntransition from dynamic to static spin correlations on the time scale of\n10^{-9} seconds. Measurements in a magnetic field applied along the\n[1${\\bar1}$0] direction in zero-field cooled conditions show that the system\ncan be broken up into orthogonal sets of polarized alpha chains along\n[1${\\bar1}$0] and quasi-one-dimensional beta chains along [110]. Three\ndimensional correlations between beta chains are shown to be very sensitive to\nthe precise alignment of the [1${\\bar1}$0] externally applied magnetic field.\n", "  We have performed detailed x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals\nof the spin-Peierls compound TiOBr in order to study the critical properties of\nthe transition between the incommensurate spin-Peierls state and the\nparamagnetic state at Tc2 ~ 48 K. We have determined a value of the critical\nexponent beta which is consistent with the conventional 3D universality\nclasses, in contrast with earlier results reported for TiOBr and TiOCl. Using a\nsimple power law fit function we demonstrate that the asymptotic critical\nregime in TiOBr is quite narrow, and obtain a value of beta_{asy} = 0.32 +/-\n0.03 in the asymptotic limit. A power law fit function which includes the first\norder correction-to-scaling confluent singularity term can be used to account\nfor data outside the asymptotic regime, yielding a more robust value of\nbeta_{avg} = 0.39 +/- 0.05. We observe no evidence of commensurate fluctuations\nabove Tc1 in TiOBr, unlike its isostructural sister compound TiOCl. In\naddition, we find that the incommensurate structure between Tc1 and Tc2 is\nshifted in Q-space relative to the commensurate structure below Tc1.\n", "  We have performed time-of-flight neutron scattering measurements on powder\nsamples of the unconventional spin-Peierls compound TiOBr using the\nfine-resolution Fermi chopper spectrometer (SEQUOIA) at the SNS. These\nmeasurements reveal two branches of magnetic excitations within the\ncommensurate and incommensurate spin-Peierls phases, which we associate with n\n= 1 and n = 2 triplet excitations out of the singlet ground state. These\nmeasurements represent the first direct measure of the singlet-triplet energy\ngap in TiOBr, which is determined to be Eg = 21.2 +/- 1.0 meV.\n", "  We have performed x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements on a\nseries of Ir-based 5d transition metal compounds, including Ir, IrCl3, IrO2,\nNa2IrO3, Sr2IrO4, and Y2Ir2O7. By comparing the intensity of the \"white-line\"\nfeatures observed at the Ir L2 and L3 absorption edges, it is possible to\nextract valuable information about the strength of the spin-orbit coupling in\nthese systems. We observe remarkably large, non-statistical branching ratios in\nall Ir compounds studied, with little or no dependence on chemical composition,\ncrystal structure, or electronic state. This result confirms the presence of\nstrong spin-orbit coupling effects in novel iridates such as Sr2IrO4, Na2IrO3,\nand Y2Ir2O7, and suggests that even simple Ir-based compounds such as IrO2 and\nIrCl3 may warrant further study. In contrast, XAS measurements on Re-based 5d\ncompounds, such as Re, ReO2, ReO3, and Ba2FeReO6, reveal statistical branching\nratios and negligible spin-orbit coupling effects.\n", "  Four 4-dimensional Painlev\\'e-type equations are obtained by isomonodromic\ndeformation of Fuchsian equations: they are the Garnier system in two\nvariables, the Fuji-Suzuki system, the Sasano system, and the sixth matrix\nPainlev\\'e system. Degenerating these four source equations, we systematically\nobtained other 4-dimensional Painlev\\'e-type equations. If we only consider\nPainlev\\'e-type equations whose associated linear equations are of unramified\ntype, there are 22 types of 4-dimensional Painlev\\'e-type equations: 9 of them\nare partial differential equations, 13 of them are ordinary differential\nequations. Some well-known equations such as Noumi-Yamada systems are included\nin this list. They are written as Hamiltonian systems, and their Hamiltonians\nare neatly written using Hamiltonians of the classical Painlev\\'e equations.\n", "  We propose a theory of optically-induced currents in dielectrics and wide-gap\nsemiconductors exposed to a non-resonant ultrashort laser pulse with a\nstabilized carrier-envelope phase. In order to describe strong-field electron\ndynamics, equations for density matrix have been solved self-consistently with\nequations for the macroscopic electric field inside the medium, which we model\nby a one-dimensional potential. We provide a detailed analysis of physically\nimportant quantities (band populations, macroscopic polarization, and\ntransferred charge), which reveals that carrier-envelope phase control of the\nelectric current can be interpreted as a result of quantum-mechanical\ninterference of multiphoton excitation channels. Our numerical results are in\ngood agreement with experimental data.\n", "  The simple finite Lie superalgebras D(2,1;\\alpha), G(3), D(4,1), D(2,2),\nA(3,1) and F(4) admit D-module representations, given by a set of differential\noperators of a single real variable t, at a critical value of the scaling\ndimension \\lambda. These superalgebras are one-dimensional N-extended\nsuperconformal algebras with N=4 (D(2,1;\\alpha)), N=7 (G(3)) and N=8 (the\nremaining ones). The critical D-module reps induce invariant actions in the\nLagrangian framework for superconformal mechanics in D target dimensions. The\nN=8 critical scalings \\lambda=1/(D-4) are linked to the D-dimensional harmonic\nfunctions with D=1,2,3,5,6,7,8. This talk is based on J. Math. Phys. 53 (2012)\n043513 (arXiv:1112.0995), J. Math. Phys. 53 (2012) 103518 (arXiv:1208.3612) and\nsome extra material.\n", "  We formulate a theory of low-temperature, stationary photoluminescence from a\nquantum-dot molecule composed of two spherical quantum dots whose electronic\nsubsystems are resonantly coupled via the Coulomb interaction. We show that the\ncoupling leads to the hybridization of the first excited states of the quantum\ndots, manifesting itself as a pair of photoluminescence peaks with intensities\nand spectral positions strongly dependent on the geometric, material, and\nrelaxation parameters of the quantum-dot molecule. These parameters are\nexplicitly contained in the analytical expression for the photoluminescence\ndifferential cross section derived in the paper. The developed theory and\nexpression obtained are essential in interpreting and analyzing spectroscopic\ndata on the secondary emission of coherently coupled quantum systems.\n", "  Symmetric and antisymmetric terms have been obtained in the framework of the\nvariational approach for two-dimensional (2D) Coulomb systems of symmetric\ntrions XXY. Stability diagrams and certain anomalies arising in the 2D space\nare explained qualitatively in the framework of the Born--Oppenheimer adiabatic\napproximation. The asymptotics of energy terms at large distances obtained for\nan arbitrary space dimensionality are analyzed, and some approximation formulas\nfor 2D terms are proposed. An anomalous dependence of multipole moments on the\nspace dimensionality has been found in the case of a spherically symmetric\nfield. The main results obtained for the 2D and 3D problems of two Coulomb\ncenters are compared.\n", "  This paper contends that the spacetime distortions resulting from the\nexperimentally obtainable electric field of a parallel plate capacitor\nconfiguration cannot be detected by the White-Juday Warp Field Interferometer\n[1]. Any post-processing results indicating a vanishing, non-zero difference\nbetween the charged and uncharged states of the capacitor are due to local\neffects rather than spacetime perturbations.\n", "  In this paper, the color-octet long distance matrix elements are studied\nthough the inclusive $J/\\psi$ production in $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation within\nthe non-relativistic QCD frame. The calculations are up-to next-to-leading\norder with the radiative corrections and relativistic corrections at the\nB-factory energy region and the near-threshold region of $4.6\\sim5.6~{\\rm\nGeV}$. A constraint of the long distance matrix elements\n($\\langle^1S_0^{8}\\rangle$, $\\langle^3P_0^{8}\\rangle$) is obtained. Through our\nestimation, the P-wave color-octet matrix element ( $\\langle0|^3P^8_0|0\\rangle$\n) should be the order of $0.005m_c^2~{\\rm GeV}^3$ or less. The constraint\nregion is not compatible with the values of the long distance matrix elements\nfitted at hadron colliders.\n", "  We present the first reported case of the simultaneous metallicity\ndetermination of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy, from both afterglow\nabsorption lines as well as strong emission-line diagnostics. Using\nspectroscopic and imaging observations of the afterglow and host of the\nlong-duration Swift GRB121024A at z = 2.30, we give one of the most complete\nviews of a GRB host/environment to date. We observe a strong damped Ly-alpha\nabsorber (DLA) with a hydrogen column density of log N(HI) = 21.88 +/- 0.10, H2\nabsorption in the Lyman-Werner bands (molecular fraction of log(f)~ -1.4;\nfourth solid detection of molecular hydrogen in a GRB-DLA), the nebular\nemission lines H-alpha, H-beta, [O II], [O III] and [N II], as well as metal\nabsorption lines. We find a GRB host galaxy that is highly star-forming (SFR ~\n40 solar masses/yr ), with a dust-corrected metallicity along the line of sight\nof [Zn/H]corr = -0.6 +/- 0.2 ([O/H] ~ -0.3 from emission lines), and a\ndepletion factor [Zn/Fe] = 0.85 +/- 0.04. The molecular gas is separated by 400\nkm/s (and 1-3 kpc) from the gas that is photoexcited by the GRB. This implies a\nfairly massive host, in agreement with the derived stellar mass of\nlog(M/M_solar ) = 9.9+/- 0.2. We dissect the host galaxy by characterising its\nmolecular component, the excited gas, and the line-emitting star-forming\nregions. The extinction curve for the line of sight is found to be unusually\nflat (Rv ~15). We discuss the possibility of an anomalous grain size\ndistributions. We furthermore discuss the different metallicity determinations\nfrom both absorption and emission lines, which gives consistent results for the\nline of sight to GRB 121024A.\n", "  We develop a new method for deriving local laws for a large class of random\nmatrices. It is applicable to many matrix models built from sums and products\nof deterministic or independent random matrices. In particular, it may be used\nto obtain local laws for matrix ensembles that are \\emph{anisotropic} in the\nsense that their resolvents are well approximated by deterministic matrices\nthat are not multiples of the identity. For definiteness, we present the method\nfor sample covariance matrices of the form $Q := T X X^* T^*$, where $T$ is\ndeterministic and $X$ is random with independent entries. We prove that with\nhigh probability the resolvent of $Q$ is close to a deterministic matrix, with\nan optimal error bound and down to optimal spectral scales.\n  As an application, we prove the edge universality of $Q$ by establishing the\nTracy-Widom-Airy statistics of the eigenvalues of $Q$ near the soft edges. This\nresult applies in the single-cut and multi-cut cases. Further applications\ninclude the distribution of the eigenvectors and an analysis of the outliers\nand BBP-type phase transitions in finite-rank deformations; they will appear\nelsewhere.\n  We also apply our method to Wigner matrices whose entries have arbitrary\nexpectation, i.e. we consider $W+A$ where $W$ is a Wigner matrix and $A$ a\nHermitian deterministic matrix. We prove the anisotropic local law for $W+A$\nand use it to establish edge universality.\n", "  Nuclear spins in the solid state environment of diamond are highly coherent,\nbut difficult to rapidly control due to the small nuclear gyromagnetic ratio.\nHere we demonstrate a more than 50-fold enhancement of the effective nuclear\ngyromagnetic ratio by coupling the nuclear spin to an electronic spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. The enhancement allows for faster\nnuclear spin rotations and is in good agreement with second-order perturbation\ntheory. The method may be applied to other systems with similar\nelectron-nuclear spin interactions, such as phosphorous donors in silicon,\nopening up the possibility of fast and direct nuclear spin control in coupled\nspin systems.\n", "  This work presents Wigner-type quasiprobability distributions for the rigid\nrotator which become, in the limit h=0, coherent solutions of the classical\nLiouville equation known as the \"action waves\" of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The\nresults are consistent with the usual quantization of the intrinsic angular\nmomentum, but for the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, a finite \"zero\npoint\" energy term is obtained. It is shown that during the time when a\nquasiprobability distribution evolves according to the Liouville equation, the\nrelated quantum wave function should satisfy the time-dependent Schroedinger\nequation.\n", "  The $k$'th frequency moment of a sequence of integers is defined as $F_k =\n\\sum_j n_j^k$, where $n_j$ is the number of times that $j$ occurs in the\nsequence. Here we study the quantum complexity of approximately computing the\nfrequency moments in two settings. In the query complexity setting, we wish to\nminimise the number of queries to the input used to approximate $F_k$ up to\nrelative error $\\epsilon$. We give quantum algorithms which outperform the best\npossible classical algorithms up to quadratically. In the multiple-pass\nstreaming setting, we see the elements of the input one at a time, and seek to\nminimise the amount of storage space, or passes over the data, used to\napproximate $F_k$. We describe quantum algorithms for $F_0$, $F_2$ and\n$F_\\infty$ in this model which substantially outperform the best possible\nclassical algorithms in certain parameter regimes.\n", "  We present a simple nanodevice that can operate in two modes: i) three-state\nmemory and ii) reading device. The nanodevice is fabricated with an array of\nordered triangular-shaped nanomagnets embedded in a superconducting thin film.\nThe input signal is ac current and the output signal is dc voltage. Vortex\nratchet effect in combination with out of plane magnetic anisotropy of the\nnanomagnets is the background physics which governs the nanodevice performance.\n", "  This paper concerns development of a high-performance implementation of the\nParticle-in-Cell method for plasma simulation on Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors.\nWe discuss suitability of the method for Xeon Phi architecture and present our\nexperience of porting and optimization of the existing parallel\nParticle-in-Cell code PICADOR. Direct porting with no code modification gives\nperformance on Xeon Phi close to 8-core CPU on a benchmark problem with 50\nparticles per cell. We demonstrate step-by-step application of optimization\ntechniques such as improving data locality, enhancing parallelization\nefficiency and vectorization that leads to 3.75 x speedup on CPU and 7.5 x on\nXeon Phi. The optimized version achieves 18.8 ns per particle update on Intel\nXeon E5-2660 CPU and 9.3 ns per particle update on Intel Xeon Phi 5110P. On a\nreal problem of laser ion acceleration in targets with surface grating that\nrequires a large number of macroparticles per cell the speedup of Xeon Phi\ncompared to CPU is 1.6 x.\n", "  Let $V(t) = e^{tG_b},\\: t \\geq 0,$ be the semigroup generated by Maxwell's\nequations in an exterior domain $\\Omega \\subset {\\mathbb R}^3$ with dissipative\nboundary condition $E_{tan}- \\gamma(x) (\\nu \\wedge B_{tan}) = 0, \\gamma(x) > 0,\n\\forall x \\in \\Gamma = \\partial \\Omega.$ We prove that if $\\gamma(x)$ is\nnowhere equal to 1, then for every $0 < \\epsilon \\ll 1$ and every $N \\in\n{\\mathbb N}$ the eigenvalues of $G_b$ lie in the region $\\Lambda_{\\epsilon}\n\\cup {\\mathcal R}_N,$ where $\\Lambda_{\\epsilon} = \\{ z \\in {\\mathbb C}:\\: |\\Re\nz | \\leq C_{\\epsilon} (|\\Im z|^{\\frac{1}{2} + \\epsilon} + 1), \\: \\Re z < 0\\},$\n${\\mathcal R}_N = \\{z \\in {\\mathbb C}:\\: |\\Im z| \\leq C_N (|\\Re z| + 1)^{-N},\\:\n\\Re z < 0\\}.$\n", "  We discuss a new scenario for the formation of intermediate mass black holes\nin dense star clusters. In this scenario, intermediate mass black holes are\nformed as a result of dynamical interactions of hard binaries containing a\nstellar mass black hole, with other stars and binaries. We discuss the\nnecessary conditions to initiate the process of intermediate mass black hole\nformation and the influence of an intermediate mass black hole on the host\nglobal globular cluster properties. We discuss two scenarios for intermediate\nmass black hole formation. The SLOW and FAST scenarios. They occur later or\nearlier in the cluster evolution and require smaller or extremely large central\ndensities, respectively. In our simulations, the formation of intermediate mass\nblack holes is highly stochastic. In general, higher formation probabilities\nfollow from larger cluster concentrations (i.e. central densities). We further\ndiscuss possible observational signatures of the presence of intermediate mass\nblack holes in globular clusters that follow from our simulations. These\ninclude the spatial and kinematic structure of the host cluster, possible\nradio, X-ray and gravitational wave emissions due to dynamical collisions or\nmass-transfer and the creation of hypervelocity main sequence escapers during\nstrong dynamical interactions between binaries and an intermediate mass black\nhole. All simulations discussed in this paper were performed with the MOCCA\nMonte Carlo code. MOCCA accurately follows most of the important physical\nprocesses that occur during the dynamical evolution of star clusters but, as\nwith other dynamical codes, it approximates the dissipative processes connected\nwith stellar collisions and binary mergers.\n", "  The dispersion of a CROW made of photonic crystal mode-gap cavities is\npronouncedly asymmetric. This asymmetry cannot be explained by the standard\ntight binding model. We show that the fundamental cause of the asymmetric\ndispersion is the fact that the cavity mode profile itself is dispersive, i.e.,\nthe mode wave function depends on the driving frequency, not the\neigenfrequency. This occurs because the photonic crystal cavity resonances do\nnot form a complete set. By taking into account the dispersive mode profile, we\nformulate a mode coupling model that accurately describes the asymmetric\ndispersion without introducing any new free parameters.\n", "  In this paper, we apply Osgood's criterion from the theory of ordinary\ndifferential equations to detect finite-time singularities in a spatially flat\nFLRW universe in the context of a perfect fluid, a perfect fluid with bulk\nviscosity, and a Chaplygin and anti-Chaplygin gas. In particular, we applied\nOsgood's criterion to demonstrate singularity behaviour for Type 0/big crunch\nsingularities as well as Type II/sudden singularities. We show that in each\ncase the choice of initial conditions is important as a certain number of\ninitial conditions leads to finite-time, Type 0 singularities, while other\nprecise choices of initial conditions which depend on the cosmological matter\nparameters and the cosmological constant can avoid such a finite-time\nsingularity. Osgood's criterion provides a powerful and yet simple way of\ndeducing the existence of these singularities, and also interestingly enough,\nprovides clues of how to eliminate singularities from certain cosmological\nmodels.\n", "  A major current challenge poses the systematic construction of coarse-grained\nmodels that are dynamically consistent, and, moreover, might be used for\nsystems driven out of thermal equilibrium. Here we present a novel prescription\nthat extends the Markov state modelling approach to driven systems. The first\nstep is to construct a complex network of microstates from detailed atomistic\nsimulations with transition rates that break detailed balance. The\ncoarse-graining is then carried out in the cycle space of this network. To this\nend we introduce the concept of representatives, which stand for many cycles\nwith similar properties. We show how to find these cycle communities using\nwell-developed standard algorithms. Removing all cycles except for the\nrepresentatives defines the coarse-grained model, which is mapped back onto a\nnetwork with far fewer states and renormalized transition rates that, however,\npreserve the entropy production of the original network. Our approach is\nillustrated and validated for a single driven particle.\n", "  In this essay, I argue that mathematics is a natural science---just like\nphysics, chemistry, or biology---and that this can explain the alleged\n\"unreasonable\" effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences. The main\nchallenge for this view is to explain how mathematical theories can become\nincreasingly abstract and develop their own internal structure, whilst still\nmaintaining an appropriate empirical tether that can explain their later use in\nphysics. In order to address this, I offer a theory of mathematical\ntheory-building based on the idea that human knowledge has the structure of a\nscale-free network and that abstract mathematical theories arise from a\nrepeated process of replacing strong analogies with new hubs in this network.\nThis allows mathematics to be seen as the study of regularities, within\nregularities, within ..., within regularities of the natural world. Since\nmathematical theories are derived from the natural world, albeit at a much\nhigher level of abstraction than most other scientific theories, it should come\nas no surprise that they so often show up in physics.\n  This version of the essay contains an addendum responding to Slyvia\nWenmackers' essay and comments that were made on the FQXi website.\n", "  Causality places nontrivial constraints on QFT in Lorentzian signature, for\nexample fixing the signs of certain terms in the low energy Lagrangian. In\nd-dimensional conformal field theory, we show how such constraints are encoded\nin crossing symmetry of Euclidean correlators, and derive analogous constraints\ndirectly from the conformal bootstrap (analytically). The bootstrap setup is a\nLorentzian four-point function corresponding to propagation through a\nshockwave. Crossing symmetry fixes the signs of certain log terms that appear\nin the conformal block expansion, which constrains the interactions of\nlow-lying operators. As an application, we use the bootstrap to rederive the\nwell known sign constraint on the $(\\partial\\phi)^4$ coupling in effective\nfield theory, from a dual CFT. We also find constraints on theories with higher\nspin conserved currents. Our analysis is restricted to scalar correlators, but\nwe argue that similar methods should also impose nontrivial constraints on the\ninteractions of spinning operators.\n", "  The effect of out-of-plane orientational freedom on the orientational\nordering properties of a monolayer of hard ellipsoids is studied using\nParsons-Lee scaling approach and replica exchange Monte Carlo computer\nsimulation. Prolate and oblate ellipsoids exhibit very different ordering\nproperties, namely, the axes of revolution of prolate particles tend to lean\nout, while those of oblate ones prefer to lean into the confining plane. The\ndriving mechanism of this is that the particles try to maximize the available\nfree area on the confining surface, which can be achieved by minimizing the\ncross section areas of the particles with the plane. In the lack out-of-plane\norientational freedom the monolayer of prolate particles is identical to a\ntwo-dimensional hard ellipse system, which undergoes an isotropic-nematic\nordering transition with increasing density. With gradually switching on the\nout-of-plane orientational freedom the prolate particles lean out from the\nconfining plane and a destabilisation of the in-plane isotropic-nematic phase\ntransition is observed. The system of oblate particles behaves oppositely to\nthat of prolates. It corresponds to a two-dimensional system of hard disks in\nthe lack of out-of-plane freedom, while it behaves similar to that of hard\nellipses in the freely rotating case.\n", "  Many link formation mechanisms for the evolution of social networks have been\nsuccessful to reproduce various empirical findings in social networks. However,\nthey have largely ignored the fact that individuals make decisions on whether\nto create links to other individuals based on cost and benefit of linking, and\nthe fact that individuals may use perception of the network in their decision\nmaking. In this paper, we study the evolution of social networks in terms of\nperception-based strategic link formation. Here each individual has her own\nperception of the actual network, and uses it to decide whether to create a\nlink to another individual. An individual with the least perception accuracy\ncan benefit from updating her perception using that of the most accurate\nindividual via a new link. This benefit is compared to the cost of linking in\ndecision making. Once a new link is created, it affects the accuracies of other\nindividuals' perceptions, leading to a further evolution of the actual network.\nAs for initial actual networks, we consider homogeneous and heterogeneous\ncases. The homogeneous initial actual network is modeled by Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\n(ER) random networks, while we take a star network for the heterogeneous case.\nIn any cases, individual perceptions of the actual network are modeled by ER\nrandom networks with controllable linking probability. Then the stable link\ndensity of the actual network is found to show discontinuous transitions or\njumps according to the cost of linking. As the number of jumps is the\nconsequence of the dynamical complexity, we discuss the effect of initial\nconditions on the number of jumps to find that the dynamical complexity\nstrongly depends on how much individuals initially overestimate or\nunderestimate the link density of the actual network. For the heterogeneous\ncase, the role of the highly connected individual as an information spreader is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper, we consider rolling tachyon, with steep run-away type of\npotentials non-minimally coupled to massive neutrino matter. The coupling\ndynamically builds up at late times as neutrino matter turns non-relativistic.\nIn case of scaling and string inspired potentials, we have shown that\nnon-minimal coupling leads to minimum in the field potential. Given a suitable\nchoice of model parameters, it is shown to give rise to late-time acceleration\nwith the desired equation of state.\n", "  We describe a systematic search for X-ray counterparts of radio pulsars. The\nsearch was accomplished by cross-correlating the radio timing positions of all\nradio pulsars from the ATNF pulsar database (version 1.54) with archival\nXMM-Newton and Chandra observations publicly released by July 1st 2016. In\ntotal, 178 of the archival XMM-Newton observations and 213 of the archival\nChandra datasets where found to have a radio pulsar serendipitously in the\nfield of view. From the 288 radio pulsars covered by these datasets we\nidentified 20 previously undetected X-ray counterparts. For 6 of them the\nstatistics was sufficient to model the energy spectrum with one- or\ntwo-component models. For the remaining new detections and for those pulsars\nfor which we determined an upper limit to their counting rate we computed the\nenergy flux by assuming a Crab-like spectrum. Additionally, we derived upper\nlimits on the neutron stars' surface temperature and on the non-thermal X-ray\nefficiency for those pulsars for which the spin-down energy was known. The\ntemperature upper limits where compared with predictions from various neutron\nstar cooling models and where found to be in agreement with the minimal cooling\nparadigm\n", "  Recent experimental developments in diverse areas - ranging from cold atomic\ngases over light-driven semiconductors to microcavity arrays - move systems\ninto the focus, which are located on the interface of quantum optics, many-body\nphysics and statistical mechanics. They share in common that coherent and\ndriven-dissipative quantum dynamics occur on an equal footing, creating genuine\nnon-equilibrium scenarios without immediate counterpart in condensed matter.\nThis concerns both their non-thermal flux equilibrium states, as well as their\nmany-body time evolution. It is a challenge to theory to identify novel\ninstances of universal emergent macroscopic phenomena, which are tied\nunambiguously and in an observable way to the microscopic drive conditions. In\nthis review, we discuss some recent results in this direction. Moreover, we\nprovide a systematic introduction to the open system Keldysh functional\nintegral approach, which is the proper technical tool to accomplish a merger of\nquantum optics and many-body physics, and leverages the power of modern quantum\nfield theory to driven open quantum systems.\n", "  We report on ab-initio NCSM calculations of the A=4 mirror Lambda hypernuclei\nLambda-4H and Lambda-4He, using the Bonn-Juelich LO chiral EFT YN potentials\nplus a CSB Lambda0--Sigma0 mixing vertex. In addition to reproducing rather\nwell the 0+ (g.s.) and 1+ (exc.) binding energies, these four-body calculations\ndemonstrate for the first time that the observed CSB splitting of mirror\nlevels, reaching hundreds of keV for 0+ (g.s.), can be reproduced using\nrealistic theoretical interaction models, although with a non-negligible\nmomentum cutoff dependence. Our results are discussed in relation to recent\nmeasurements of the Lambda-4H (0+ g.s.) binding energy [MAMI A1 Collaboration,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 114, 232501 (2015)] and the Lambda-4He (1+ exc.) excitation\nenergy [J-PARC E13 Collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 222501 (2015)].\n", "  Estimating city evacuation time is a non-trivial problem due to the\ninteraction between thousands of individual agents, giving rise to various\ncollective phenomena, such as bottleneck formation, intermittent flow and\nstop-and-go waves. We present a mean field approach to draw relationships\nbetween road network spatial attributes, number of evacuees and resultant\nevacuation time estimate (ETE). We divide $50$ medium sized UK cities into a\ntotal of $697$ catchment areas which we define as an area where all agents\nshare the same nearest exit node. In these catchment areas, 90% of agents are\nwithin $5.4$ km of their designated exit node. We establish a characteristic\nflow rate from catchment area attributes (population, distance to exit node and\nexit node width) and a mean flow rate in free-flow regime by simulating total\nevacuations using an agent based `queuing network' model. We use these\nvariables to determine a relationship between catchment area attributes and\nresultant ETE. This relationship could enable emergency planners to make rapid\nappraisal of evacuation strategies and help support decisions in the run up to\na crisis.\n", "  We study a fluid of two-dimensional parallel hard squares in bulk and under\nconfinement in channels, with the aim of evaluating the performance of\nFundamental-Measure Theory (FMT). To this purpose, we first analyse the phase\nbehaviour of the bulk system using FMT and Percus-Yevick theory, and compare\nthe results with MD and MC simulations. In a second step, we study the confined\nsystem and check the results against those obtained from Transfer Matrix Method\nand from our own Monte Carlo simulations. Squares are confined to channels with\nparallel walls at angles of 0$^{\\circ}$ or 45$^{\\circ}$ relative to the\ndiagonals of the parallel hard squares, respectively, which allows for an\nassessment of the effect of the external-potential symmetry on the fluid\nstructural properties. In general FMT overestimates bulk correlations,\npredicting the existence of a columnar phase (absent in simulations) prior to\ncrystallisation. The equation of state predicted by FMT compares well with\nsimulations, although the PY approach with the virial route is better in some\nrange of packing fractions. The FMT is highly accurate for the structure and\ncorrelations of the confined fluid due to the dimensional crossover property\nfulfilled by the theory. Both density profiles and equations of state of the\nconfined system are accurately predicted by the theory. The highly non-uniform\npair correlations inside the channel are also very well described by FMT.\n", "  High-refractive-index semiconductor optical waveguides form the basis for\nmodern photonic integrated circuits (PICs) , but the conventional methods of\nachieving optical confinement require a thick lower-refractive-index support\nlayer that impedes large-scale co-integration with electronics. To address this\nchallenge, we present a general architecture for single-mode waveguides that\nconfine light in a high-refractive-index material on a native substrate. Our\nwaveguide consists of a high-aspect-ratio fin of the guiding material\nsurrounded by lower-refractive-index dielectrics and is compatible with\nstandard top-down fabrication techniques. The proposed waveguide geometry\nremoves the need for a buried-oxide-layer in silicon photonics, as well as the\nInGaAsP layer in InP-based PICs and will allow for photonic integration on\nemerging material platforms such as diamond and SiC.\n", "  We prove exponential convergence to the stationary measure for a class of 1d\nLagrangian systems with random forcing in the space-periodic setting: $$\n\\phi_t+\\phi_x^2/2=F^{\\omega}, x \\in S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}. $$ This\nconfirms a part of a conjecture formulated in [9]. Our result is a consequence\n(and the natural stochastic PDE counterpart) of the results obtained in [5, 7].\nIt is also the natural analogue of the deterministic result [11] which holds in\na generic setting.\n", "  Magnetic-edge magnetoplasmons (MEMPs) are obtained for a two-dimensional\nelectron system (2DES) with atop semi-infinite metallic gate, at a distance\n$d$, and atop semi-infinite ferromagnetic film at a strong perpendicular\nmagnetic field. For two most fast MEMPs, one with positive chirality and other\nwith negative chirality, a strong spatial dispersion, due to effect of metallic\nhalf-plane gate, is obtained; some slower MEMPs manifest spatial dispersion\ntoo. Present MEMPs are localized at the magnetic-edge that is close to the\nwedge of metallic half-plane gate; the metallic wedge enhances localization of\nMEMPs at magnetic-edge. Obtained spatial dispersion has unconventional form. In\nparticular, for two most fast MEMPs the phase velocities, $\\omega/k_{x}$, are\nthe linear polynomials on the wave vector $k_{x}$ in the long-wavelength\nregion, $k_{x}d \\ll 1$. Strong effect of the ferromagnetic film hysteresis on\nthe MEMPs phase velocities and their anti-crossings are obtained for $0<k_{x}d\n\\leq1$. Two MEMPs of opposite chirality, especially two most fast MEMPs, at\nsome resonance frequency can create a resonance circuit, with closed wave path\nalong a fraction of the magnetic edge perimeter, with a total change of the\nwave phase given by an integer of $2\\pi$.\n", "  Temperature in a simple thermodynamical system is not limited from above. It\nis also widely believed that it does not make sense talking about temperatures\nhigher than the Planck temperature in the absence of the full theory of quantum\ngravity. Here, we demonstrate that there exist a maximal achievable temperature\nin a system where particles obey the laws of quantum mechanics and classical\ngravity before we reach the realm of quantum gravity. Namely, if two particles\nwith a given center of mass energy come at the distance shorter than the\nSchwarzschild diameter apart, according to classical gravity they will form a\nblack hole. It is possible to calculate that a simple thermodynamical system\nwill be dominated by black holes at a critical temperature which is about three\ntimes lower than the Planck temperature. That represents the maximal achievable\ntemperature in a simple thermodynamical system.\n", "  Since the sequencing of large genomes, many statistical features of their\nsequences have been found. One intriguing feature is that certain subsequences\nare much more abundant than others. In fact, abundances of subsequences of a\ngiven length are distributed with a scale-free power-law tail, resembling\nproperties of human texts, such as the Zipf's law. Despite recent efforts, the\nunderstanding of this phenomenon is still lacking. Here we find that selfish\nDNA elements, such as those belonging to the Alu family of repeats, dominate\nthe power-law tail. Interestingly, for the Alu elements the power-law exponent\nincreases with the length of the considered subsequences. Motivated by these\nobservations, we develop a model of selfish DNA expansion. The predictions of\nthis model qualitatively and quantitatively agree with the empirical\nobservations. This allows us to estimate parameters for the process of selfish\nDNA spreading in a genome during its evolution. The obtained results shed light\non how evolution of selfish DNA elements shapes non-trivial statistical\nproperties of genomes.\n", "  In this work we introduce an evolutionary strategy to solve combinatorial\noptimization tasks, i.e. problems characterized by a discrete search space. In\nparticular, we focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), i.e. a famous\nproblem whose search space grows exponentially, increasing the number of\ncities, up to becoming NP-hard. The solutions of the TSP can be codified by\narrays of cities, and can be evaluated by fitness, computed according to a cost\nfunction (e.g. the length of a path). Our method is based on the evolution of\nan agent population by means of an imitative mechanism, we define `partial\nimitation'. In particular, agents receive a random solution and then,\ninteracting among themselves, may imitate the solutions of agents with a higher\nfitness. Since the imitation mechanism is only partial, agents copy only one\nentry (randomly chosen) of another array (i.e. solution). In doing so, the\npopulation converges towards a shared solution, behaving like a spin system\nundergoing a cooling process, i.e. driven towards an ordered phase. We\nhighlight that the adopted `partial imitation' mechanism allows the population\nto generate solutions over time, before reaching the final equilibrium. Results\nof numerical simulations show that our method is able to find, in a finite\ntime, both optimal and suboptimal solutions, depending on the size of the\nconsidered search space.\n", "  Suspensions of purely repulsive but self-propelled Brownian particles might\nundergo phase separation, a phenomenon that strongly resembles the phase\nseparation of passive particles with attractions. Here we employ computer\nsimulations to study the nucleation kinetics and the microscopic pathway active\nBrownian disks take in two dimensions when quenched from the homogeneous\nsuspension to propulsion speeds beyond the binodal. We find the same\nqualitative behavior for the nucleation rate as a function of density as for a\npassive suspension undergoing liquid-vapor separation, suggesting that the\nscenario of an effective free energy also extends to the kinetics of phase\nseparation. We study the transition in more detail through a committor analysis\nand find that transition states are best described by a combination of cluster\nsize and the radial polarization of particles in the cluster.\n", "  We present an adjoint-based method for the calculation of eigenvalue\nperturbations in nonlinear, degenerate and non self-adjoint eigenproblems. This\nmethod is applied to a thermo-acoustic annular combustor network, the stability\nof which is governed by a nonlinear eigenproblem. We calculate the first- and\nsecond-order sensitivities of the growth rate and frequency to geometric, flow\nand flame parameters. Three different configurations are analysed. The\nbenchmark sensitivities are obtained by finite difference, which involves\nsolving the nonlinear eigenproblem at least as many times as the number of\nparameters. By solving only one adjoint eigenproblem, we obtain the\nsensitivities to any thermo-acoustic parameter, which match the\nfinite-difference solutions at much lower computational cost.\n", "  GRS 1747$-$312 is a neutron star Low-Mass X-ray Binary in the globular\ncluster Terzan 6, located at a distance of 9.5 kpc from the Earth. During its\noutbursts, periodic eclipses were known to occur. Observations for the\noutbursts were performed with Chandra in 2004 and Swift in 2013. XMM-Newton\nobserved its quiescent state in 2004. In addition, when Suzaku observed it in\n2009 as a part of Galactic center mapping observations, GRS 1747$-$312 was\nfound to be in a low luminosity state with $L_{\\rm x} \\sim 1.2 \\times 10^{35}$\nerg s$^{-1}$. All of the observations except for XMM-Newton included the time\nof the eclipses predicted. We analyzed archival data of these observations.\nDuring the Chandra and Swift observations, we found clear flux decreases at the\nexpected time of the eclipses. During the Suzaku observation, however, there\nwere no clear signs for the predicted eclipses. The lapse of the predicted\neclipses during the Suzaku observation can be explained by a contaminant source\nquite close to GRS 1747$-$312. When GRS 1747$-$312 is in the quiescent state,\nwe observe X-rays from the contaminant source rather than from GRS 1747$-$312.\nHowever, we have no clear evidence for the contaminant source in our data. The\nlapse might also be explained by thick material ($N_{\\rm H} > 10^{24}$\ncm$^{-2}$ ) between the neutron star and the companion star, though the origin\nof the thick material is not clear.\n", "  We study the compatibility of large quasar groups with the concordance\ncosmological model. Large Quasar Groups are very large spatial associations of\nquasars in the cosmic web, with sizes of 50-250h^-1 Mpc. In particular, the\nlargest large quasar group known, named Huge-LQG, has a longest axis of\n~860h^-1 Mpc, larger than the scale of homogeneity (~260 Mpc), which has been\nnoted as a possible violation of the cosmological principle. Using mock\ncatalogues constructed from the Horizon Run 2 cosmological simulation, we found\nthat large quasar groups size, quasar member number and mean overdensity\ndistributions in the mocks agree with observations. The Huge-LQG is found to be\na rare group with a probability of 0.3 per cent of finding a group as large or\nlarger than the observed, but an extreme value analysis shows that it is an\nexpected maximum in the sample volume with a probability of 19 per cent of\nobserving a largest quasar group as large or larger than Huge-LQG. The Huge-LQG\nis expected to be the largest structure in a volume at least 5.3 +- 1 times\nlarger than the one currently studied.\n", "  We propose a stress tensor for the Kerr black hole written in the\nBoyer-Lindquist coordinate. To achieve this, we use the dictionary of the\nFlat/CCFT correspondence and take the flat-space limit from the quasi-local\nstress tensor of the four-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. The proposed stress\ntensor yields the correct values for the mass and angular momentum of the Kerr\nblack hole at spatial infinity. We also calculate some components of the energy\nmomentum tensor of the three dimensional CCFT and show that they are consistent\nwith the holographic calculation of the Kerr black hole. The calculation we\npresent in this paper is another confirmation for the Flat/CCFT proposal.\n", "  Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation times are measured on copper using magnetic\nresonance force microscopy performed at temperatures down to 42 mK. The low\ntemperature is verified by comparison with the Korringa relation. Measuring\nspin-lattice relaxation times locally at very low temperatures opens up the\npossibility to measure the magnetic properties of inhomogeneous electron\nsystems realized in oxide interfaces, topological insulators and other strongly\ncorrelated electron systems such as high-Tc superconductors.\n", "  Quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently than any\npossible conventional computer. Small quantum algorithms have been demonstrated\non multiple quantum computing platforms, many specifically tailored in hardware\nto implement a particular algorithm or execute a limited number of\ncomputational paths. Here, we demonstrate a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum\ncomputer that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum\nalgorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic gates. We\ncompile algorithms into a fully-connected set of gate operations that are\nnative to the hardware and have a mean fidelity of 98 %. Reconfiguring these\ngate sequences provides the flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms\nwithout altering the hardware. As examples, we implement the Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ)\nand Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithms with average success rates of 95 % and\n90 %, respectively. We also perform a coherent quantum Fourier transform (QFT)\non five trappedion qubits for phase estimation and period finding with average\nfidelities of 62 % and 84 %, respectively. This small quantum computer can be\nscaled to larger numbers of qubits within a single register, and can be further\nexpanded by connecting several such modules through ion shuttling or photonic\nquantum channels.\n", "  Multimode fibers are attractive for a variety of applications such as\ninternet data transfer, data center hubs, micromanipulation, optogenetics and\nother biomedical applications. A major hurdle for imaging through multimode\nfibers is the occurring scrambling, resulting in a randomization of light.\nRecently, clear imaging has been successfully accomplished using wavefront\nshaping, but the spatial information was transferred synchronously only. We\ndemonstrate asynchronous information transmission using individual phase\nconjugations by employing only one spatial light modulator with multiple\nwindows. Our findings pave the way towards individual signal transfer inside\nstrongly scattering media.\n", "  The equation of state associated with ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills\nin 4 dimensions, for $SU(N)$ in the large $N$ limit, is investigated using the\nAdS/CFT correspondence. An asymptotically AdS black-hole on the gravity side\nprovides a thermal background for the Yang-Mills theory on the boundary in\nwhich the cosmological constant is equivalent to a volume. The thermodynamic\nvariable conjugate to the cosmological constant is a pressure and the $P-V$\ndiagram is studied. It is known that there is a critical point where the heat\ncapacity diverges and this is reflected in the isothermal compressibility.\nCritical exponents are derived and found to be mean field in the large $N$\nlimit. The same analysis applied to 3 and 6 dimensional conformal field\ntheories again yields mean field exponents associated with the compressibility\nat the critical point.\n", "  The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) in the Milky Way are the primary\ntargets in the indirect searches for particle dark matter. To set robust\nconstraints on candidate of dark matter particles, understanding the dark halo\nstructure of these systems is of substantial importance. In this paper, we\nfirst evaluate the astrophysical factors for dark matter annihilation and decay\nfor 24 dSphs, with taking into account a non-spherical dark halo, using\ngeneralized axisymmetric mass models based on axisymmetric Jeans equations.\nFirst, from a fitting analysis of the most recent kinematic data available, our\naxisymmetric mass models are a much better fit than previous spherical ones,\nthus, our work should be the most realistic and reliable estimator for\nastrophysical factors. Secondly, we find that among analysed dSphs, the\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies Triangulum II and Ursa Major II are the most\npromising but large uncertain targets for dark matter annihilation while the\nclassical dSph Draco is the most robust and detectable target for dark matter\ndecay. It is also found that the non-sphericity of luminous and dark components\ninfluences the estimate of astrophysical factors, even though these factors\nlargely depend on the sample size, the prior range of parameters and the\nspatial extent of the dark halo. Moreover, owing to these effects, the\nconstraints on the dark matter annihilation cross-section are more conservative\nthan those of previous spherical works. These results are important for\noptimizing and designing dark matter searches in current and future\nmulti-messenger observations by space and ground-based telescopes.\n", "  Due to their low surface mass density, two-dimensional materials with a\nstrong piezoelectric response are interesting for nanoelectromechanical systems\nwith high force sensitivity. Unlike graphene, the two sublattices in a\nmonolayer of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are occupied by different elements,\nwhich breaks inversion symmetry and allows for piezoelectricity. This has been\nconfirmed with density functional theory calculations of the piezoelectric\nconstant of hBN. Here, we formulate an entirely analytical derivation of the\nelectronic contribution to the piezoelectric response in this system based on\nthe concepts of strain-induced pseudomagnetic vector potential and the modern\ntheory of polarization that relates the polar moment to the Berry curvature.\nOur findings agree with the symmetry restrictions expected for the hBN lattice\nand reproduce well the magnitude of the piezoelectric effect previously\nobtained ab-initio.\n", "  We investigate the charmed baryon production reaction\n$p\\bar{p}\\rightarrow\\Lambda_c\\bar{\\Lambda}_c$ in an effective Lagrangian\napproach. Besides the $t$-channel $D^0$ and $D^{*0}$ mesons exchanges, the\n$s$-channel $Y(4630)$ meson exchange is taken into account. For the total cross\nsections, the $D^0$ and $D^{*0}$ mesons provide minor background contributions,\nwhile the $Y(4630)$ state gives a clear peak structure with the magnitude of 10\n$\\mu$b at center of mass energy 4.63 GeV. Basing on the results, we suggest\nthat the reaction of $p\\bar{p}\\rightarrow\\Lambda_c\\bar{\\Lambda}_c$ can be used\nto search for the $1^{--}$ charmonium-like $Y(4630)$ state, and our predictions\ncan be tested in future by the $\\rm{\\bar PANDA}$ facility.\n", "  The social brain hypothesis predicts that humans have an average of about 150\nrelationships at any given time. Within this 150, there are layers of friends\nof an ego, where the number of friends in a layer increases as the emotional\ncloseness decreases. Here we analyse a mobile phone dataset, firstly, to\nascertain whether layers of friends can be identified based on call frequency.\nWe then apply different clustering algorithms to break the call frequency of\negos into clusters and compare the number of alters in each cluster with the\nlayer size predicted by the social brain hypothesis. In this dataset we find\nstrong evidence for the existence of a layered structure. The clustering yields\nresults that match well with previous studies for the innermost and outermost\nlayers, but for layers in between we observe large variability.\n", "  Charge symmetry breaking (CSB) in the $\\Lambda$-nucleon strong interaction\ngenerates a charge dependence of $\\Lambda$ separation energies in mirror\nhypernuclei, which in the case of the $A=4$ mirror hypernuclei $0^+$ ground\nstates is sizable, $\\Delta B^{J=0}_{\\Lambda}\\equiv B^{J=0}_{\\Lambda}\n(_{\\Lambda}^4{\\rm He}) -B^{J=0}_{\\Lambda}(_{\\Lambda}^4{\\rm H})=230\\pm 90$ keV,\nand of opposite sign to that induced by the Coulomb repulsion in light\nhypernuclei. Recent ab-initio calculations of the ($_{\\Lambda}^4{\\rm\nH},{_{\\Lambda}^4{\\rm He}}$) mirror hypernuclei $0^+_{\\rm g.s.}$ and $1^+_{\\rm\nexc}$ levels have demonstrated that a $\\Lambda - \\Sigma^0$ mixing CSB model due\nto Dalitz and von Hippel (1964) is capable of reproducing this large value of\n$\\Delta B^{J=0}_{\\Lambda}$. These calculations are discussed here with emphasis\nplaced on the leading-order chiral EFT hyperon-nucleon strong-interaction\nBonn-Juelich potential model used and the no-core shell-model calculational\nscheme applied. The role of one-pion exchange in producing sizable CSB level\nsplittings in the $A=4$ mirror hypernuclei is discussed.\n", "  Atmospheric pressure steam/oxygen plasma is generated by a 88 Hz, 6kV AC\npower supply. The properties of the produced plasma are investigated by optical\nemission spectroscopy (OES). The relative intensity, rotational, vibrational,\nexcitation temperatures and electron density are studied as function of applied\nvoltage, electrode spacing and oxygen flow rate. The rotational and vibrational\ntemperatures are determined simulating the bands with the aid of LIFBASE\nsimulation software. The excitation temperature is obtained from the CuI\ntransition taking non-thermal equilibrium condition into account employing\nintensity ratio method. The electron density is approximated from the\nH_{\\alpha} Stark broadening using the Voigt profile fitting method. It is\nobserved that the rotational and vibrational temperatures are decreased with\nincreasing electrode spacing and O2 flow rate, but increased with the applied\nvoltage. The excitation temperature is found to increase with increasing\napplied voltage and O2 flow rate, but decrease with electrode spacing. The\nelectron density is increased with increasing applied voltage while it seems to\ndownward trend with increasing electrode spacing and O2 flow rate.\n", "  We present a new N-body code, gevolution, for the evolution of large scale\nstructure in the Universe. Our code is based on a weak field expansion of\nGeneral Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson\ngauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we\nwrite in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for\nrelativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild\nsolution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body\ncodes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale\nstructure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational\nslip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include\ndifferent kinds of dark energy or modified gravity models and going beyond the\nusually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.\n", "  We report results of low frequency nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nexperiments in the superfluid polar phase of 3He which is stabilized by a new\ntype of \"nematic\" aerogel - nafen. We have found that an interaction between\ntransverse and longitudinal NMR modes may essentially influence the spin\ndynamics. Theoretical formulas for NMR resonant frequencies are derived and\napplied for interpretation of the experimental results.\n", "  The spectrum and morphology of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission\ncarries valuable information on cosmic ray (CR) propagation. Recent results\nobtained by analyzing Fermi-LAT data accumulated over seven years of\nobservation show a substantial variation of the CR spectrum as a function of\nthe distance from the Galactic Center. The spatial distribution of the CR\ndensity in the outer Galaxy appears to be weakly dependent upon the\ngalactocentric distance, as found in previous studies as well, while the\ndensity in the central region of the Galaxy was found to exceed the value\nmeasured in the outer Galaxy. At the same time, Fermi-LAT data suggest a\ngradual spectral softening while moving outward from the center of the Galaxy\nto its outskirts. These findings represent a challenge for standard\ncalculations of CR propagation based on assuming a uniform diffusion\ncoefficient within the Galactic volume. Here we present a model of non-linear\nCR propagation in which transport is due to particle scattering and advection\noff self-generated turbulence. We find that for a realistic distribution of CR\nsources following the spatial distribution of supernova remnants and the space\ndependence of the magnetic field on galactocentric distance, both the spatial\nprofile of CR density and the spectral softening can easily be accounted for.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly on the\nnonequilibrium evolution of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) using\nreal-time lattice gauge theory techniques. For field strengths exceeding the\nSchwinger limit for pair production, we encounter a highly absorptive medium\nwith anomaly-induced dynamical refractive properties. In contrast to earlier\nexpectations based on equilibrium properties, where net anomalous effects\nvanish because of the trivial vacuum structure, we find that out-of-equilibrium\nconditions can have dramatic consequences for the presence of quantum currents\nwith distinctive macroscopic signatures. We observe an intriguing tracking\nbehavior, where the system spends longest times near collinear field\nconfigurations with maximum anomalous current. Apart from the potential\nrelevance of our findings for future laser experiments, similar phenomena\nrelated to the chiral magnetic effect are expected to play an important role\nfor strong QED fields during initial stages of heavy-ion collision experiments.\n", "  Experiments to probe the basic quantum properties of motional degrees of\nfreedom of mechanical systems have developed rapidly over the last decade. One\npromising approach is to use hybrid electromechanical systems incorporating\nsuperconducting qubits and microwave circuitry. However, a critical challenge\nfacing the development of these systems is to achieve strong coupling between\nmechanics and qubits while simultaneously reducing coupling of both the qubit\nand mechanical mode to the environment. Here we report measurements of a\nqubit-coupled mechanical resonator system consisting of an ultra-high-frequency\nnanoresonator and a long coherence-time superconducting transmon qubit,\nembedded in superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. It is demonstrated that\nthe nanoresonator and transmon have commensurate energies and transmon\ncoherence times are one order of magnitude larger than for all previously\nreported qubit-coupled nanoresonators. Moreover, we show that numerical\nsimulations of this new hybrid quantum system are in good agreement with\nspectroscopic measurements and suggest that the nanoresonator in our device\nresides at low thermal occupation number, near its ground state, acting as a\ndissipative bath seen by the qubit. We also outline how this system could soon\nbe developed as a platform for implementing more advanced experiments with\ndirect relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics,\nincluding the study of nanoresonator quantum noise properties, reservoir\nengineering, and nanomechanical quantum state generation and detection.\n", "  We study the effects of long-range hopping and long-range inter-particle\ninteractions on quantum walk of hard-core bosons in ideal and disordered\none-dimensional lattices. We find that the range of hopping has a much more\nsignificant effect on the particle correlation dynamics than the range of\ninteractions. We illustrate that long-range hopping makes the correlation\ndiagrams asymmetric with respect to the sign of the interaction and examine the\nrelative role of repulsive and attractive interactions on the dynamics of\nscattering by isolated impurities and Anderson localization in dis- ordered\nlattices. We show that weakly repulsive interactions increase the probability\nof tunnelling through isolated impurities and decrease the localization.\n", "  Stellar companions can influence the formation and evolution of planetary\nsystems, but there are currently few observational constraints on the\nproperties of planet-hosting binary star systems. We search for stellar\ncompanions around 77 transiting hot Jupiter systems to explore the statistical\nproperties of this population of companions as compared to field stars of\nsimilar spectral type. After correcting for survey incompleteness, we find that\n$47\\%\\pm7\\%$ of hot Jupiter systems have stellar companions with semi-major\naxes between 50-2000 AU. This is 2.9 times larger than the field star companion\nfraction in this separation range, with a significance of $4.4\\sigma$. In the\n1-50AU range, only $3.9^{+4.5}_{-2.0}\\%$ of hot Jupiters host stellar\ncompanions compared to the field star value of $16.4\\%\\pm0.7\\%$, which is a\n$2.7\\sigma$ difference. We find that the distribution of mass ratios for\nstellar companions to hot Jupiter systems peaks at small values and therefore\ndiffers from that of field star binaries which tend to be uniformly distributed\nacross all mass ratios. We conclude that either wide separation stellar\nbinaries are more favorable sites for gas giant planet formation at all\nseparations, or that the presence of stellar companions preferentially causes\nthe inward migration of gas giant planets that formed farther out in the disk\nvia dynamical processes such as Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We determine that\nless than 20% of hot Jupiters have stellar companions capable of inducing\nKozai-Lidov oscillations assuming initial semi-major axes between 1-5 AU,\nimplying that the enhanced companion occurrence is likely correlated with\nenvironments where gas giants can form efficiently.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the emission properties of double quantum dot\ndriven by a monochromatic electromagnetic field, while undergoing resonant\ntunneling and dissipation by phonons. We found emission spectra for both cases,\nwith and without phonons, whose comparison allows to determine the dissipative\neffects. On the basis of the obtained results we propose efficient control of\nthe resonance fluorescence of an artificial molecule, suitable for\noptoelectronic applications.\n", "  With first principles calculations, we predict a novel stable 2D layered\nstructure for group VI elements Se and Te that we call square selenene and\nsquare tellurene, respectively. They have chair-like buckled structures similar\nto other layered materials such as silicene and germanene but with a square\nunit cell rather than hexagonal. This special structure gives rise to\nanisotropic band dispersions near the Fermi level that can be described by a\ngeneralized semi-Dirac Hamiltonian. We show that the considerably large band\ngap ($\\sim$0.1 eV) opened by spin-orbit coupling makes square selenene and\ntellurene topological insulators, hosting non-trivial edge states. Therefore,\nsquare selenene and tellurene are promising materials for novel electronic and\nspintronic applications. Finally, we show that this new type of 2D elemental\nmaterial can potentially be grown on proper substrates, such as a Au(100)\nsurface.\n", "  We present observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 3\nGHz toward a sub-field of the XXL-North 25 deg$^{2}$ field targeting the first\nsupercluster discovered in the XXL Survey. The structure has been found at a\nspectroscopic redshift of 0.43 and extending over $0.35\\times0.1$ deg$^{2}$ on\nthe sky. We present the 3 GHz VLA radio continuum observations, the radio\nmosaic and radio source catalogue, and, perform an analysis of the supercluster\nin the optical and radio regimes using photometric redshifts from the CFHTLS\nsurvey and our new VLA data. Our 3 GHz radio mosaic has a resolution of\n$3.2\\times1.9$ arcsec$^2$, and covers an area of $41\\times41$ arcmin$^2$ with\nrms noise level below $\\sim20 \\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ ($\\sim11\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in\ncentral $15\\times15$ arcmin$^2$). We extract a catalogue of 155 radio sources\n$\\geq6\\sigma$, 8 of which are multicomponent sources, and 123 ($79\\%$) can be\nassociated with optical sources in the CFHTLS W1 catalogue. Applying Voronoi\ntessellation analysis (VTA) in the area around the X-ray identified\nsupercluster we identify a total of 17 overdensities at $z=0.35-0.50$, 7 of\nwhich are associated with clusters detected in the $XMM-Newton$ XXL data. We\nfind a mean photometric redshift of 0.43 for our overdensities, consistent with\nthe spectroscopic redshifts of 7 X-ray detected clusters. The full\nVTA-identified structure extends over $\\sim0.6\\times0.2$ deg$^2$ on the sky,\n($\\sim12\\times4$ Mpc$^{2}$ at $z=0.43$). We associate 8 radio sources with\npotential group/cluster member galaxies none of which are large radio galaxies.\nThe spatial distribution of the red and blue potential group member galaxies\nsuggests that the clusters are dynamically young and not virialised yet, as\nexpected for hierarchical structure growth in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe. Further\nspectroscopic data are required to analyze the dynamical state of the groups.\n", "  In this paper, the modified entropic force law is studied by using a new kind\nof generalized uncertainty principle which contains a minimal length, a minimal\nmomentum and a maximal momentum. Firstly, the quantum corrections to the\nthermodynamics of a black hole is investigated. Then, according to Verlinde's\ntheory, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected entropic force is\nobtained. The result shows that the GUP corrected entropic force is related not\nonly to the properties of the black holes, but also to the Planck length and\nthe dimensionless constants $\\alpha _{\\rm{0}}$ and $\\beta _{\\rm{0}}$. Moreover,\nbased on the GUP corrected entropic force, we also derive the modified\nEinstein's field equation (EFE) and the modified Friedmann equation.\n", "  We use the Jeans equations for an ensemble of collisionless particles to\ndescribe the distribution of broad-line region (BLR) cloud in three classes:\n(A) non disc (B) disc-wind (c) pure disc structure. We propose that clumpy\nstructures in the brightest quasars belong to class A, fainter quasars and\nbrighter Seyferts belong to class B, and dimmer Seyfert galaxies and all\nlow-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) belong to class C. We derive the virial factor,\n$f$, for disc-like structures and find a negative correlation between the\ninclination angle, $\\theta_{0}$, and $f$. We find similar behaviour for $f$ as\na function of the FWHM and $\\sigma_{z}$, the $z$ component of velocity\ndispersion. For different values of $\\theta_{0}$ we find that $ 1.0 \\lesssim f\n\\lesssim 9.0 $ in type1 AGNs and $ 0.5 \\lesssim f \\lesssim 1.0 $ in type2 AGNs.\nMoreover we have $ 0.5 \\lesssim f \\lesssim 6.5 $ for different values of FWHM\nand $ 1.4 \\lesssim f \\lesssim 1.8 $ for different values of $ \\sigma_{z} $. We\nalso find that $ f $ is relatively insensitive to the variations of bolometric\nluminosity and column density of each cloud and the range of variation of $ f $\nis in order of 0.01. Considering wide range of $ f $ we see the use of average\nvirial factor $ \\langle f \\rangle $ is not very safe. Therefore we propose AGN\ncommunity to divide a sample into a few subsamples based on the value of $\n\\theta_{0}$ and FWHM of members and calculate $ \\langle f \\rangle $ for each\ngroup separately to reduce uncertainty in black hole mass estimation.\n", "  The Newman-Janis Ansatz was used first to obtain the stationary Kerr metric\nfrom the static Schwarzschild metric. Many works have been devoted to\ninvestigate the physical significance of this Ansatz, but no definite answer\nhas been given so far. We show that this Ansatz can be applied in general to\nconformastatic vacuum metrics, and leads to stationary generalizations which,\nhowever, do not preserve the conformal symmetry. We investigate also the\nparticular case when the seed solution is given by the Schwarzschild spacetime\nand show that the resulting rotating configuration does not correspond to a\nvacuum solution, even in the limiting case of slow rotation. In fact, it\ndescribes in general a relativistic fluid with anisotropic pressure and heat\nflux. This implies that the Newman-Janis Ansatz strongly depends on the choice\nof representation for the seed solution. We interpret this result as as a\nfurther indication of its applicability limitations.\n", "  In recent years, the Renyi entropy has repeatedly been discussed for\ncharacterization of quantum critical states and entanglement. Here, time\nevolution of the Renyi entropy is studied. A compact general formula is\npresented for the lower bound on the entropy rate.\n", "  How black holes accrete surrounding matter is a fundamental, yet unsolved\nquestion in astrophysics. It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into\nblack holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the\nmass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington\nlimit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disc, causing\nrepetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on\ntimescales of minutes to hours. In fact, such oscillations have been observed\nonly in sources with a high mass accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105. These\nlarge-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to have\nphysical origins distinct from X-ray or optical variations with small\namplitudes and fast ($\\lesssim$10 sec) timescales often observed in other black\nhole binaries (e.g., XTE J1118+480 and GX 339-4). Here we report an extensive\nmulti-colour optical photometric data set of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient\nsource containing a black hole of nine solar masses (and a conpanion star) at a\ndistance of 2.4 kiloparsecs. Our data show that optical oscillations on\ntimescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates more\nthan ten times lower than previously thought. This suggests that the accretion\nrate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disc instabilities.\nInstead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key condition for these\nlarge-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the large disc in\nbinaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too low to\nmaintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disc. The lack of\nsustained accretion -- not the actual rate -- would then be the critical factor\ncausing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems.\n", "  We present long-term photometric observations of the young open cluster IC\n348 with a baseline time-scale of 2.4 yr. Our study was conducted with several\ntelescopes from the Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative (YETI) network in the\nBessel $R$ band to find periodic variability of young stars. We identified 87\nstars in IC 348 to be periodically variable; 33 of them were unreported before.\nAdditionally, we detected 61 periodic non-members of which 41 are new\ndiscoveries. Our wide field of view was the key to those numerous newly found\nvariable stars. The distribution of rotation periods in IC 348 has always been\nof special interest. We investigate it further with our newly detected periods\nbut we cannot find a statistically significant bimodality. We also report the\ndetection of a close eclipsing binary in IC 348 composed of a low-mass stellar\ncomponent ($M \\gtrsim 0.09\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) and a K0 pre-main sequence\nstar ($M \\approx 2.7\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$). Furthermore, we discovered three\ndetached binaries among the background stars in our field of view and confirmed\nthe period of a fourth one.\n", "  The definition of entanglement temperature for the quantum walk on the line\nis extended to $N$-cycles, which are more amenable to a physical\nimplementation. We show that, for these systems, there is a linear connection\nbetween the thermalization time and the mixing time, and also that these\ncharacteristic times become insensitive to the system size when $N$ is larger\nthan a few units\n", "  We report on mapping of the local density of states in L3 photonic crystal\nresonators (PCR) via deterministically positioned single Ge quantum dots (QDs).\nPerfect site-control of Ge QDs on pre-patterned silicon-on-insulator substrates\nwas exploited to fabricate in one processing run almost 300 L3 PCRs containing\nsingle QDs in systematically varying positions in the cavities. The alignment\nprecision of the QD emitters was better than 20 nm. This type of parallel\nprocessing is essentially based on standard Si device technologies and is\ntherefore scalable to any number and configuration of PCR structures. As a\nfirst demonstrator, we probed the coupling efficiency of a single Ge QD to the\nL3 cavity modes as a function of their spatial overlap. The results are in very\ngood agreement with finite-difference time-domain simulations.\n", "  The pullback approach to global Finsler geometry is adopted. Three classes of\nrecurrence in Finsler geometry are introduced and investigated: simple\nrecurrence, Ricci recurrence and concircular recurrence. Each of these classes\nconsists of four types of recurrence. The interrelationships between the\ndifferent types of recurrence are studied. The generalized concircular\nrecurrence, as a new concept, is singled out.\n", "  A model of nonlinear electrodynamics with the Lagrangian density ${\\cal L} =\n-(1/\\beta)\\arcsin(\\beta F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}/4)$ is proposed. The scale\ninvariance and the dual invariance of electromagnetic fields are broken in the\nmodel. In the limit $\\beta\\rightarrow 0$ one comes to Maxwell's electrodynamics\nand the scale and dual invariances are recovered. We investigate the effect of\ncoupling electromagnetic fields with the gravitational field. The asymptotic\nblack hole solution is found which is similar to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nsolution. We obtain corrections to Coulomb's law and to the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution in the model proposed. The existence of the\nregular asymptotic at $r\\rightarrow 0$ was demonstrated. The mass of the black\nhole is calculated possessing the electromagnetic origin. It was shown that\nthere are not superluminal fluctuations and principles of causality and\nunitarity take place.\n", "  We study the temperature dependence of the orbital susceptibility of an\nexcitonic insulator on the basis of a two-band model. It is shown that a\ndrastic change (an anomalous enhancement) in susceptibility as a function of\ntemperature occurs owing to the occurrence of additional orbital susceptibility\ndue to the excitonic gap. We calculate explicitly the temperature dependence of\norbital susceptibility for a model of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, and show that the result\nis consistent with experimental results.\n", "  Three three-component (bulge, disk, halo) model Galactic gravitational\npotentials differing by the expression for the dark matter halo are considered.\nThe central (bulge) and disk components are described by the Miyamoto-Nagai\nexpressions. The Allen-Santill'an (I), Wilkinson-Evans (II), and\nNavarro-Frenk-White (III) models are used to describe the halo. A set of\npresent-day observational data in the range of Galactocentric distances R from\n0 to 200 kpc is used to refine the parameters of these models. The model\nrotation curves have been fitted to the observed velocities by taking into\naccount the constraints on the local matter density \\rho_\\odotand the force\nK_{z=1.1} acting perpendicularly to the Galactic plane. The Galactic mass\nwithin a sphere of radius 50 kpc,\n  M_G (R<=50 kpc)=(0.41+/-0.12)x10^12 M_\\odot, is shown to satisfy all three\nmodels. The differences between the models become increasingly significant with\nincreasing radius R. In model I, the Galactic mass within a sphere of radius\n200 kpc turns out to be greatest among the models considered,\n  M_G (R<=200 kpc)=(1.45+/-0.30)x10^12 M_\\odot, and the smallest value has been\nfound in model II,\n  M_G (R<=200 kpc)=(0.61+/-0.12)x10^{12} M_\\odot.\n  In our view, model III is the best one among those considered, because it\nensures the smallest residual between the data and the constructed model\nrotation curve provided that the constraints on the local parameters hold with\na high accuracy. Here, the Galactic mass is\n  M_G (R<=200 kpc)=(0.75+/-0.19)x10^12 M_\\odot.\n  A comparative analysis with the models by Irrgang et al. (2013), including\nthose using the integration of orbits for the two globular clusters NGC 104 and\nNGC 1851 as an example, has been performed. The third model is shown to have\nsubjected to a significant improvement.\n", "  White dwarfs are compact stars, similar in size to Earth but ~200,000 times\nmore massive. Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet\nto near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less dense stars,\nwhite dwarfs can strip material from their companions, and the resulting mass\ntransfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as near- and\nmid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in\nbinaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio\nfrequencies. Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf / cool star binary\nthat emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR\nSco), was classified in the early 1970s as a delta-Scuti star, a common variety\nof periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56 hr period\nclose binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 min. The pulses are so\nintense that AR Sco's optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30\ns, and they are detectable at radio frequencies, the first such detection for\nany white dwarf system. They reflect the spin of a magnetic white dwarf which\nwe find to be slowing down on a 10^7 yr timescale. The spin-down power is an\norder of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radiation, which,\ntogether with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is\nprimarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf's\nspin, they originate in large part from the cool star. AR Sco's broad-band\nspectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic\nelectrons. These must either originate from near the white dwarf or be\ngenerated in situ at the M star through direct interaction with the white\ndwarf's magnetosphere.\n", "  This article presents a new semi-automatic method for charge and mass\nidentification in two-dimensional matrices. The proposed algorithm is based on\nthe matrix's properties and uses as little information as possible on the\nglobal form of the identification lines, making it applicable to a large\nvariety of matrices, including Particular attention has been paid to the\nimplementation in a suitable graphical environment, so that only two\nmouse-clicks are required from the user to calculate all initialization\nparameters. Example applications to recent data from both INDRA and FAZIA\ntelescopes are presented.\n", "  In this note we show that if a family of ergodic Schr\\\"odinger operators on\n$l^2({\\Bbb Z}^\\gamma)$ with continuous potentials have uniformly localized\neigenfunctions then these eigenfunctions must be uniformly localized in a\nhomogeneous sense.\n", "  In this paper we prove the dry version of the Ten Martini problem: Cantor\nspectrum with all gaps open, for the extended Harper's model in the non\nself-dual region for Diophantine frequencies.\n", "  A new entropic gravity inspired derivation of general relativity from\nthermodynamics is presented. This generalizes, within Einstein gravity, the\n\"Thermodynamics of Spacetime\" approach by T. Jacobson, which relies on the\nRaychaudhuri evolution equation. Here the rest of the first law of\nthermodynamics is incorporated by using the Damour-Navier-Stokes equation,\nknown from the membrane paradigm for describing fluid dynamics on the horizon.\n", "  At ambient pressure (P) and below 5.5 K, olivine-type Mn2GeO4 hosts a\nmultiferroic (MF) phase where a multicomponent, i.e., multi-k magnetic order\ngenerates spontaneous ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity (FE) along the c\naxis. Under high P the FE disappears above 6 GPa, yet the P evolution of the\nmagnetic structure remained unclear based on available data. Here we report\nhigh P single crystal neutron diffraction experiments in theMF phase at T = 4.5\nK.We observe clearly that the incommensurate spiral component of the magnetic\norder responsible for FE varies little with P up to 5.1 GPa. With support from\nhigh P synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements at room temperature (T), the\nP driven suppression of FE is proposed to occur as a consequence of a crystal\nstructure transition away from the olivine structure. In addition, in the low T\nneutron scattering experiments an emergent nonhydrostatic P component, i.e., a\nuniaxial stress, leads to the selection of certain multi-k domains. We use this\nobservation to deduce a double-k conical magnetic structure for the ambient P\nground state, this being a key ingredient for a model description of the MF\nphase.\n", "  We investigated the transport properties under magnetic fields of up to 9 T\nfor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ thin films on CaF$_2$. Measurements of the temperature\ndependence of the electrical resistivity revealed that for $x = 0.2 - 0.4$,\nwhere $T_{\\rm c}$ is the highest, the width of the superconducting transition\nincreased with increasing magnetic field, while the width was almost the same\nwith increasing magnetic field for $x = 0 - 0.1$. In addition, the temperature\ndependence of the Hall coefficient drastically changed between $x = 0.1$ and\n$0.2$ at low temperatures. These results indicate that clear differences in the\nnature of the superconductivity and electronic structure exist between\n$x=0-0.1$ and $x \\ge 0.2$.\n", "  Using Brownian dynamics computer simulations we investigate the dynamics of\nthe one-body density and one-body current in a one-dimensional system of\nparticles that interact with a repulsive Gaussian pair potential. We\nsystematically split the internal force distribution into an adiabatic part,\nwhich originates from the equilibrium free energy, and a superadiabatic\ncontribution, which is neglected in dynamical density functional theory. We\nfind a strong dependence of the magnitude and phase of the superadiabatic force\ndistribution on the initial state of the system. While the magnitude of the\nsuperadiabatic force is small if the system evolves from an equilibrium state\ninside of a parabolic external potential, it is large for particles with\nequidistant initial separations at high temperature. We analyze these findings\nin the light of the known mean-field behavior of Gaussian core particles and\ndiscuss a multi-occupancy mechanism which generates superadiabatic forces that\nare out of phase with respect to the adiabatic force.\n", "  Recent studies seem to suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF)\nin early-type galaxies might be different from a classical Kroupa or Chabrier\nIMF, i.e. contain a larger fraction of the total mass in low-mass stars. From a\ntheoretical point of view, supersonic turbulence has been the subject of\ninterest in many analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the\ncharacteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star forming regions,\nand as a consequence with the stellar IMF. Performing two suites of smoothed\nparticles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with different mass resolutions, we\naim at testing the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a\ndense, star forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system mass function in\ndifferent density regimes. While analytical theories predict a shift of the\npeak of the CMF towards lower masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the\ncloud, we observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high Mach\nnumbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution. For the high-density\nregime we do not find any trend correlating the Mach number with the\ncharacteristic mass of the resulting IMF, implying that the dynamics of\nprotostellar accretion discs and fragmentation on small scales is not strongly\naffected by turbulence driven at the scale of the cloud. Furthermore, we\nsuggest that a significant fraction of dense cores are disrupted by turbulence\nbefore stars can be formed in their interior through gravitational collapse.\nAlthough this particular study has limitations in its numerical resolution, we\nsuggest that our results, along with those from other studies, cast doubt on\nthe turbulent fragmentation models on the IMF that simply map the CMF to the\nIMF.\n", "  The production of jets in polarized proton collisions at STAR is dominated by\nquark-gluon and gluon-gluon scattering processes. The dijet longitudinal\ndouble-spin asymmetry $(A_{LL})$ is sensitive to the helicity distributions and\nmay be used to extract information about the gluon helicity contribution\n$\\Delta{g(x,Q^2)}$ to the spin of the proton. Previous STAR jet measurements at\n$\\sqrt s$ = 200 GeV show evidence of polarized gluons for gluon momentum\nfractions above 0.05. The measurement of dijet $A_{LL}$ at $\\sqrt s$ = 510 GeV\nwill extend the current constraints on $\\Delta{g(x,Q^2)}$ to lower gluon\nmomentum fractions and allow for the reconstruction of the partonic kinematics\nat leading order. These proceedings present preliminary results from the dijet\n$A_{LL}$ measurement from $\\sim50 pb^{-1}$ of $\\sim50 \\%$ polarized proton data\ntaken during the 2012 RHIC run.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the conversion of a Gaussian beam to an\napproximate Bessel-Gauss mode by making use of a non-collinear four-wave mixing\nprocess in hot atomic vapor. The presence of a strong, spatially non-Gaussian\npump both converts the probe beam into a non-Gaussian mode, and generates a\nconjugate beam that is in a similar non-Gaussian mode. The resulting probe and\nconjugate modes are compared to the output of a Gaussian beam incident on an\nannular aperture that is then spatially filtered according to the\nphase-matching conditions imposed by the four-wave mixing process. We find that\nthe resulting experimental data agrees well with both numerical simulations, as\nwell as analytical formulae describing the effects of annular apertures on\nGaussian modes. These results show that spatially-multimode gain platforms may\nbe used as a new method of mode conversion.\n", "  A novel topological segmentation of retinal images represents blood vessels\nas connected regions in the continuous image plane, having shape-related\nanalytic and geometric properties. This paper presents topological segmentation\nresults from the DRIVE retinal image database.\n", "  Heavy ions induced single event upset (SEU) sensitivity of three-dimensional\nintegrated SRAMs are evaluated by using Monte Carlo sumulation methods based on\nGeant4. The cross sections of SEUs and Multi Cell Upsets (MCUs) for 3D SRAM are\nsimulated by using heavy ions with different energies and LETs. The results\nshow that the sensitivity of different die of 3D SRAM has obvious discrepancies\nat low LET. Average percentage of MCUs of 3D SRAMs rises from 17.2% to 32.95%\nwhen LET increases from 42.19 MeV cm2/mg to 58.57MeV cm2/mg. As for a certain\nLET, the percentage of MCUs shows a notable distinction between face-to-face\nstructure and back-to-face structure. For back-to-face structure, the\npercentage of MCUs increases with the deeper die. However, the face-to-face die\npresents the relatively low percentage of MCUs. The comparison of SEU cross\nsections for planar SRAMs and experiment data are conducted to indicate the\neffectiveness of our simulation method. Finally, we compare the upset cross\nsections of planar process and 3D integrated SRAMs. Results demonstrate that\nthe sensitivity of 3D SRAMs is not more than that of planar SRAMs and the 3D\nstructure can be become a great potential application for aerospace and\nmilitary domain.\n", "  Seawater intrusion (SWI) is a complex process, where 3D modeling is often\nnecessary in order to monitor and manage the affected aquifers. Here, we\npresent a synthetic study to test a joint hydrogeophysical inversion approach\naimed at solving the inverse problem of estimating initial and current\nsaltwater distribution. First, we use a 3D groundwater model for variable\ndensity flow based on discretized flow and solute mass balance equations. In\naddition to the groundwater model, a 3D geophysical model was developed for\ndirect current resistivity imaging and inversion. The objective function of the\ncoupled problem consists of data misfit and regularization terms as well as a\ncoupling term that relates groundwater and geophysical states. We present a\nnovel approach to solve the inverse problem using an Alternating Direction\nMethod of Multipliers (ADMM) to minimize this coupled objective function. The\nsensitivities are derived analytically for the discretized system of equations,\nwhich allows us to efficiently compute the gradients in the minimization\nprocedure and reduce the computational complexity of the problem. The method\nwas tested on different synthetic scenarios with groundwater and geophysical\ndata represented by solute mass fraction data and direct current resistivity\ndata. With the ADMM approach, we were able to obtain better estimates for the\nsolute distribution, compared to just considering each data set separately or\nsolving with a simple coupled approach.\n", "  Using a combination of kinetic Activation Relaxation Technique with empirical\npotential and ab initio based climbing image nudged elastic band method, we\nperform an extensive search of the migration and rotation paths of the most\nstable carbon tri-interstitial cluster in cubic SiC. Our research reveals paths\nwith the lowest energy barriers to migration, rotation, and dissociation of the\nmost stable cluster. The kinetic properties of the most stable cluster,\nincluding its mobility, rotation behavior at different temperatures and\nstability against high temperature annealing, are discussed based on the\ncalculated transition barriers. In addition to fundamental insights, our study\nprovides a methodology for investigation of other extended defects in a\ntechnologically important material.\n", "  We investigate the Casimir effect in the context of a nontrivial topology by\nmeans of a generalized Matsubara formalism. This is performed in the context of\na scalar field in $D$ Euclidean spatial dimensions with $d$ compactified\ndimensions. The procedure gives us the advantage of considering simultaneously\nspatial constraints and thermal effects. In this sense, the Casimir pressure in\na heated system between two infinite planes is obtained and the results are\ncompared with those found in the literature.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of an active particle in two-dimensional\nspherical crystals, which provide an ideal environment to illustrate the\ninterplay of active particle and crystallographic defects. A moving active\nparticle is observed to be surrounded by localized topological defects,\nbecoming a dressed active particle. Such a physical picture characterizes both\nthe lattice distortion around the moving particle and the healing of the\ndistorted lattice in its trajectory. We find that the dynamical behaviors of an\nactive particle in both random and ballistic motions uniformly conform to this\nfeatured scenario, whether the particle is initially a defect or not. We\nfurther observe that the defect pattern around a dressed ballistic active\nparticle randomly oscillates between two well-defined wing-like defect motifs\nregardless of its speed. The established physical picture of dressed active\nparticles in this work partially deciphers the complexity of the intriguing\nnonequilibrium behaviors in active crystals, and opens the promising\npossibility of introducing the activity to engineer defects, which has strong\nconnections with the design of materials.\n", "  The discovery of community structure in networks is a problem of considerable\ninterest in recent years. In online social networks, often times, users are\nsimultaneously involved in multiple social media sites, some of which share\ncommon social relationships. It is of great interest to uncover a shared\ncommunity structure across these networks. However, in reality, users typically\nidentify themselves with different usernames across social media sites. This\ncreates a great difficulty in detecting the community structure. In this paper,\nwe explore several approaches for community detection across online social\nnetworks with limited knowledge of username alignment across the networks. We\nrefer to the known alignment of usernames as seeds. We investigate strategies\nfor seed selection and its impact on networks with a different fraction of\noverlapping vertices. The goal is to study the interplay between network\ntopologies and seed selection strategies, and to understand how it affects the\ndetected community structure. We also propose several measures to assess the\nperformance of community detection and use them to measure the quality of the\ndetected communities in both Twitter-Twitter networks and Twitter-Instagram\nnetworks.\n", "  Isolated pulsars are rotating neutron stars with accurately measured angular\nvelocities $\\Omega$, and their time derivatives that show unambiguously that\nthe pulsars are slowing down. The commonly accepted view is that it arises\nthrough emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) from a rotating magnetized\nbody. The calculated energy loss by a rotating pulsar with a constant moment of\ninertia is assumed proportional to a model dependent power of $\\Omega$. This\nrelation leads to the power law $\\dot{\\Omega}$ = -K $\\Omega^{\\rm n}$ where $n$\nis called the braking index. The MDR model predicts $n$ exactly equal to 3.\nSelected observations of isolated pulsars provide rather precise values of $n$,\nindividually accurate to a few percent or better, in the range 1$ <$ n $ < $\n2.8, which is consistently less than the predictions of the MDR model. In spite\nof an extensive investigation of various modifications of the MDR model, no\nsatisfactory explanation of observation has been found yet.\n  The aim of this work is to determine the deviation of the value of $n$ from\nthe canonical $n = 3$ for a star with a frequency dependent moment of inertia\nin the region of frequencies from zero to the Kepler velocity (onset of mass\nshedding by a rotating deformed star), in the macroscopic MDR model. For the\nfirst time, we use microscopic realistic equations of state (EoS) of the star\nto determine its behavior and structure. In addition, we examine the effects of\nthe baryonic mass M$_{\\rm B}$ of the star, and possible core superfluidity, on\nthe value of the braking index within the MDR model.\n", "  We investigate two distinct sources of uncertainty in low-energy nuclear\nphysics calculations and develop ways to account for them.\n  Harmonic oscillator basis expansions are widely used in ab-initio nuclear\nstructure calculations. Finite computational resources usually require that the\nbasis be truncated before observables are fully converged, necessitating\nreliable extrapolation schemes. We show that a finite oscillator basis\neffectively imposes a hard-wall boundary condition. We accurately determine the\nposition of the hard-wall as a function of oscillator space parameters, derive\nextrapolation formulas for the energy and other observables, and discuss the\nextension of this approach to higher angular momentum.\n  Nucleon knockout reactions have been widely used to study and understand\nnuclear properties. Such an analysis implicitly assumes that the effects of the\nprobe can be separated from the physics of the target nucleus. This\nfactorization between nuclear structure and reaction components depends on the\nrenormalization scale and scheme, and has not been well understood. But it is\npotentially critical for interpreting experiments and for extracting\nprocess-independent nuclear properties. We use similarity renormalization group\n(SRG) transformations to systematically study the scale dependence of\nfactorization for the simplest knockout process of deuteron\nelectrodisintegration. We find that the extent of scale dependence depends\nstrongly on kinematics, but in a systematic way. Based on examination of the\nrelevant overlap matrix elements, we are able to qualitatively explain and even\npredict the nature of scale dependence based on the kinematics under\nconsideration.\n", "  Recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on strong\nspin-orbit coupled materials have shown an in-plane orbital texture switch at\ntheir respective Dirac points, regardless of whether they are topological\ninsulators or \"trivial\" Rashba materials. This feature has also been\ndemonstrated in a few materials ($\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Se}_3$,\n$\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Te}_3$, and $\\text{BiTeI}$) though DFT calculations. Here we\npresent a minimal orbital-derived tight binding model to calculate the electron\nwave-function in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. We show that the orbital\ncomponents of the wave-function demonstrate an orbital-texture switch in\naddition to the usual spin switch seen in spin polarized bands. This orbital\ntexture switch is determined by the existence of three main properties: local\nor global inversion symmetry breaking, strong spin-orbit coupling, and\nnon-local physics (the electrons are on a lattice). Using our model we\ndemonstrate that the orbital texture switch is ubiquitous and to be expected in\nmany real systems. The orbital hybridization of the bands is the key aspect for\nunderstanding the unique wave function properties of these materials, and this\nminimal model helps to establish the quantum perturbations that drive these\nhybridizations.\n", "  Dislocation motion in body centered cubic (bcc) metals displays a number of\nspecific features that result in a strong temperature dependence of the flow\nstress, and in shear deformation asymmetries relative to the loading direction\nas well as crystal orientation. Here we develop a generalized dislocation\nmobility law in bcc metals, and demonstrate its use in discrete Dislocation\nDynamics (DD) simulations of plastic flow in tungsten (W) micro pillars. We\npresent the theoretical background for dislocation mobility as a motivating\nbasis for the developed law. Analytical theory, molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations, and experimental data are used to construct a general\nphenomenological description. The usefulness of the mobility law is\ndemonstrated through its application to modeling the plastic deformation of W\nmicro pillars. The model is consistent with experimental observations of\ntemperature and orientation dependence of the flow stress and the corresponding\ndislocation microstructure.\n", "  Density operators allow for representing ambiguity about a vector\nrepresentation, both in quantum theory and in distributional natural language\nmeaning. Formally equivalently, they allow for discarding part of the\ndescription of a composite system, where we consider the discarded part to be\nthe context. We introduce dual density operators, which allow for two\nindependent notions of context. We demonstrate the use of dual density\noperators within a grammatical-compositional distributional framework for\nnatural language meaning. We show that dual density operators can be used to\nsimultaneously represent: (i) ambiguity about word meanings (e.g. queen as a\nperson vs. queen as a band), and (ii) lexical entailment (e.g. tiger ->\nmammal). We provide a proof-of-concept example.\n", "  We propose a new application of quantum computing to the field of natural\nlanguage processing. Ongoing work in this field attempts to incorporate\ngrammatical structure into algorithms that compute meaning. In (Coecke,\nSadrzadeh and Clark, 2010), the authors introduce such a model (the CSC model)\nbased on tensor product composition. While this algorithm has many advantages,\nits implementation is hampered by the large classical computational resources\nthat it requires. In this work we show how computational shortcomings of the\nCSC approach could be resolved using quantum computation (possibly in addition\nto existing techniques for dimension reduction). We address the value of\nquantum RAM (Giovannetti,2008) for this model and extend an algorithm from\nWiebe, Braun and Lloyd (2012) into a quantum algorithm to categorize sentences\nin CSC. Our new algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over classical\nmethods under certain conditions.\n", "  Heating by short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) such as aluminum-26 and iron-60\nfundamentally shaped the thermal history and interior structure of Solar System\nplanetesimals during the early stages of planetary formation. The subsequent\nthermo-mechanical evolution, such as internal differentiation or rapid volatile\ndegassing, yields important implications for the final structure, composition\nand evolution of terrestrial planets. SLR-driven heating in the Solar System is\nsensitive to the absolute abundance and homogeneity of SLRs within the\nprotoplanetary disk present during the condensation of the first solids. In\norder to explain the diverse compositions found for extrasolar planets, it is\nimportant to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation\nregions (star clusters) during their first few Myr of evolution. By\nconstraining the range of possible effects, we show how the imprint of SLRs can\nbe extrapolated to exoplanetary systems and derive statistical predictions for\nthe distribution of aluminum-26 and iron-60 based on N-body simulations of\ntypical to large clusters (1000-10000 stars) with a range of initial\nconditions. We quantify the pollution of protoplanetary disks by supernova\nejecta and show that the likelihood of enrichment levels similar to or higher\nthan the Solar System can vary considerably, depending on the cluster\nmorphology. Furthermore, many enriched systems show an excess in radiogenic\nheating compared to Solar System levels, which implies that the formation and\nevolution of planetesimals could vary significantly depending on the birth\nenvironment of their host stars.\n", "  The Gratton-Vargas snowplow model, recently revisited and expanded (S K H\nAuluck, Physics of Plasmas, 20, 112501 (2013)), has given rise to significant\nnew insights into some aspects of the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF), in spite of\nbeing a purely kinematic description having no reference to plasma phenomena.\nIt is able to provide a good fit to the experimental current waveforms in at\nleast 4 large facilities. It has been used for construction of a local\ncurvilinear frame of reference, in which conservation laws for mass, momentum\nand energy can be reduced to effectively-one-dimensional hyperbolic\nconservation law equations. Its utility in global parameter optimization of\ndevice parameters has been demonstrated. These features suggest that the\nGratton-Vargas model deserves a closer look at its supposed limitations near\nthe singular phase of the DPF. This paper presents a discussion of its\ndevelopment near the device axis, based on the original work of Gratton and\nVargas, with some differences. It is shown that the Gratton-Vargas partial\ndifferential equation has solutions for times after the current singularity,\nwhich exhibit an expanding bounded volume, (which can serve as model of an\nexpanding plasma column) and decreasing dynamic inductance of the discharge, in\nspite of having no built-in hydrodynamics. This enables the model to\nqualitatively reproduce the characteristic shape of the current derivative in\nDPF experiments without reference to any plasma phenomena such as\ninstabilities, anomalous resistance or reflection of hydrodynamic shock wave\nfrom the axis. The axial propagation of the solution exhibits a power-law\ndependence on the dimensionless time starting from the time of singularity,\nwhich is similar to the power-law relations predicted by theory of point\nexplosions in ideal gases and which has also been observed experimentally.\n", "  In quantum metrology, quantum probe states are capable of estimating unknown\nphysical parameters to precisions beyond classical limits. What qualities do\nsuch states possess? Here we relate the performance of a probe state at\nestimating a parameter $\\phi$ -- as quantified by the quantum Fisher\ninformation -- to the amount of purity it loses when $\\phi$ undergoes\nstatistical fluctuation. This indicates that the better a state is for\nestimating $\\phi$, the more it decoheres when $\\phi$ is subject to noise.\n", "  We present analytical derivation of the closed-form expression for the dipole\nmagnetic shielding constant of a Dirac one-electron atom being in an arbitrary\ndiscrete energy eigenstate. The external magnetic field, by which the atomic\nstate is perturbed, is assumed to be weak, uniform and time independent. With\nrespect to the atomic nucleus we assume that it is pointlike, spinless,\nmotionless and of charge Ze. Calculations are based on the Sturmian expansion\nof the generalized Dirac- Coulomb Green function [R. Szmytkowski, J. Phys. B\n30, 825 (1997); erratum 30, 2747 (1997)], combined with the theory of\nhypergeometric functions. The final result is of an elementary form and agrees\nwith corresponding formulas obtained earlier by other authors for some\nparticular states of the atom.\n", "  A micelle consists of monolayer of lipid molecules containing hydrophilic\nhead and hydrophobic tail. These amphiphilic molecules in aqueous environment\naggregate spontaneously into monomolecular layer held together due to\nhydrophobic effect by weak non-covalent forces. Micelles are flexible surfaces\nthat show variety of shapes of different topology, but remarkably in mechanical\nequilibrium conditions they are spherical in shape. The shape and size of a\nmicelle are functions of many variables such as lipid concentration,\ntemperature, ionic strength, etc. Addressing the question, why the shape of\nmicelles is sphere in mechanical equilibrium conditions, analytically proved to\nbe a difficult problem. In the following paper we offer the shortest and\nelegant analytical proof of micelles spheroidal nature when they are\nthermodynamically equilibrated with solvent. The formalism presented in this\npaper can be readily extended to any homogenous surfaces, such are vesicles and\nmembranes.\n", "  A large number of optimization algorithms have been developed by researchers\nto solve a variety of complex problems in operations management area. We\npresent a novel optimization algorithm belonging to the class of swarm\nintelligence optimization methods. The algorithm mimics the decision making\nprocess of human groups and exploits the dynamics of this process as an\noptimization tool for combinatorial problems. In order to achieve this aim, a\ncontinuous-time Markov process is proposed to describe the behavior of a\npopulation of socially interacting agents, modelling how humans in a group\nmodify their opinions driven by self-interest and consensus seeking. As in the\ncase of a collection of spins, the dynamics of such a system is characterized\nby a phase transition from low to high values of the overall consenus\n(magnetization). We recognize this phase transition as being associated with\nthe emergence of a collective superior intelligence of the population. While\nthis state being active, a cooling schedule is applied to make agents closer\nand closer to the optimal solution, while performing their random walk on the\nfitness landscape. A comparison with simulated annealing as well as with a\nmulti-agent version of the simulated annealing is presented in terms of\nefficacy in finding good solution on a NK - Kauffman landscape. In all cases\nour method outperforms the others, particularly in presence of limited\nknowledge of the agent.\n", "  We use the dipole model to analyze the inclusive DIS cross section data,\nobtained from the HERA I+II measurements \\cite{Abramowicz:2015mha}. We show\nthat these combined data are very well described within the dipole model\nframework, which is complemented with a valence quark structure functions. Our\nmotivation is to investigate the gluon density with the BGK dipole model\n\\cite{BGK} as an alternative to the PDF approach. BGK dipole model uses for\nevolution the DGLAP mechanism in the $kt$ factorization scheme (in contrast to\nthe collinear factorization for PDFs). We confirm our results from the previous\npaper \\cite{Luszczak:2013rxa} with old HERA data \\cite{HERA2010}. In addition\nwe also performed a first, preliminary investigation of saturation. The\nanalysis was done in the xFitter framework\n\\cite{xFitter,xFitter2,xFitter3,xFitter4,xFitter5}.}\n", "  We consider the motion of electrons confined to a two dimensional plane with\nan externally applied perpendicular inhomogeneous magnetic field, both with and\nwithout a Coulomb potential. We find that as long as the magnetic field is\nslowly-decaying, bound states in magnetic quantum dots are indeed possible.\nSeveral example cases of such magnetic quantum dots are considered in which one\ncan find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in closed form, including two\nhitherto unknown quasi-exactly solvable models treated with confluent and\nbiconfluent Heun polynomials. It is shown how a modulation of the strength of\nthe magnetic field can exclude magnetic vortex-like states, rotating with a\ncertain angular momenta and possessing a definite spin orientation, from\nforming. This indicates one may induce localization-delocalization transitions\nand suggests a mechanism for spin-separation.\n", "  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detection of\ngravitational waves that take away 5 per cent of the total mass of two merging\nblack holes points out on the importance of considering varying gravitational\nmass of a system in the framework of the Einstein general theory of relativity.\nWe calculate the acceleration of a particle in the non-stationary field of a\nquasi-spherical system composed of a large number of objects emitting\ngravitational waves. It is shown that reduction of the gravitational mass of\nthe system due to emitting gravitational waves leads to a repulsive\ngravitational force that diminishes with time but never disappears. This\nrepulsive force may be related to the observed expansion of the Universe.\n", "  We identify a fundamental space-time invariance principle by combining the\nthesis of the conventionality of simultaneity with the Hugyens-Fresnel-Miller\nmodel of wave propagation. By following the standard gauge prescription, we\nshow that the classical electromagnetic potentials influence the one-way speed\nof light.\n", "  We prove an identity that relates the q-Laplace transform of the height\nfunction of a (higher spin inhomogeneous) stochastic six vertex model in a\nquadrant on one side, and a multiplicative functional of a Macdonald measure on\nthe other. The identity is used to prove the GUE Tracy-Widom asymptotics for\ntwo instances of the stochastic six vertex model via asymptotics analysis of\nthe corresponding Schur measures.\n", "  FIR observation of BCD galaxies with Herschel has revealed a wealth of new\ninsights in these objects which are thought to resemble high-redshift forming\ngalaxies. Dust and cold gas showed to be colder, in more or less quantities\nthan expected and of uncertain origin. However, not unlike in the local\nuniverse, not all the dust or the cold gas is accounted for, making it more\nchallenging. SPICA and its factor 10 to 100 in sensitivity will allow to image\nthe faint extended cold gas/dusty disks in BCDGs in addition to detect faint C\nand O lines only marginally or not at all detected by Herschel/\n", "  We study Faraday and resonant waves in two-component quasi-one-dimensional\n(cigar-shaped) collisionally inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates subject to\nperiodic modulation of the radial confinement. We show by means of extensive\nnumerical simulations that, as the system exhibits stronger spatially-localised\nbinary collisions (whose scattering length is taken for convenience to be of\nGaussian form), the system becomes effectively a linear one. In other words, as\nthe scattering length approaches a delta-function, we observe that the two\nnonlinear configurations typical for binary cigar-shaped condensates, namely\nthe segregated and the symbiotic one, turn into two overlapping Gaussian wave\nfunctions typical for linear systems, and that the instability onset times of\nthe Faraday and resonant waves become longer. Moreover, our numerical\nsimulations show that the spatial period of the excited waves (either resonant\nor Faraday ones) decreases as the inhomogeneity becomes stronger. Our results\nalso demonstrate that the topology of the ground state impacts the dynamics of\nthe ensuing density waves, and that the instability onset times of Faraday and\nresonant waves, for a given level of inhomogeneity in the two-body\ninteractions, depend on whether the initial configuration is segregated or\nsymbiotic.\n", "  In this paper, we will give a rigorous construction of the exact discrete\nLagrangian formulation associated to a continuous Lagrangian problem. Moreover,\nwe work in the setting of Lie groupoids and Lie algebroids which is enough\ngeneral to simultaneously cover several cases of interest in discrete and\ncontinuous descriptions as, for instance, Euler-Lagrange equations,\nEuler-Poincar\\'e equations, Lagrange-Poincar\\'e equations... The construction\nof an exact discrete Lagrangian is of considerable interest for the analysis of\nthe error between an exact trajectory and the discrete trajectory derived by a\nvariational integrator.\n", "  We present an analytical lower bound of multipartite concurrence based on the\ngeneralized Bloch representations of density matrices. It is shown that the\nlower bound can be used as an effective entanglement witness of genuine\nmultipartite entanglement. Tight lower and upper bounds for multipartite\ntangles are also derived. Since the lower bounds depend on just part of the\ncorrelation tensors, the result is experimentally feasible.\n", "  The OPERA long baseline experiment located in the INFN Gran Sasso underground\nLaboratory was designed to establish the $\\nu_{\\mu}$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\nu_{\\tau}$\noscillations in appearance mode, using the CNGS neutrino beam. Five\n$\\nu_{\\tau}$ candidate events have been detected in a data sample from the\n2008-2012 runs, with a expected background of 0.25 events. The background only\nhypothesis is rejected with a significance larger than 5${\\sigma}$. The\nanalysis of the tau neutrino sample in the framework of the 3+1 neutrino model\nis presented. OPERA is able to identify $\\nu_{e}$ CC events due to the good\ntracking capabilities of its target. The electron neutrino sample is also used\nto set limits on the 3+1 oscillation parameters.\n", "  Cells actively probe and respond to the stiffness of their surroundings.\nSince mechanosensory cells in connective tissue are surrounded by a disordered\nnetwork of biopolymers, their in vivo mechanical environment can be extremely\nheterogeneous. Here, we investigate how this heterogeneity impacts\nmechanosensing by modeling the cell as an idealized local stiffness sensor\ninside a disordered fiber network. For all types of networks we study,\nincluding experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin architectures, we find that\nmeasurements applied at different points throughout a given network yield a\nstrikingly broad range of local stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades. We\nverify via simulations and scaling arguments that this broad range of local\nstiffnesses is a generic property of disordered fiber networks, and show that\nthe range can be further increased by tuning specific network features,\nincluding the presence of long fibers and the proximity to elastic transitions.\nThese features additionally allow for a highly tunable dependence of stiffness\non probe length. Finally, we show that to obtain optimal, reliable estimates of\nglobal tissue stiffness, a cell must adjust its size, shape, and position to\nintegrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.\n", "  Planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (N=4 SYM) is a special\nquantum field theory. A few of its remarkable features are conformal symmetry\nat the quantum level, evidence of integrability and, moreover, it is a prime\nexample of the AdS/CFT duality. Triggered by Witten's twistor string theory,\nthe past 15 years have witnessed enormous progress in reformulating this theory\nto make as many of these special features manifest, from the choice of\nconvenient variables to recursion relations that allowed new mathematical\nstructures to appear, like the Grassmannian. These methods are collectively\nreferred to as on-shell methods. The ultimate hope is that, by understanding\nN=4 SYM in depth, one can learn about other, more realistic quantum field\ntheories. The overarching theme of this thesis is the investigation of how\non-shell methods can aid the computation of quantities other than scattering\namplitudes. In this spirit we study form factors and correlation functions,\nsaid to be partially and completely off-shell quantities, respectively. More\nexplicitly, we compute form factors of half-BPS operators up to two loops, and\nstudy the dilatation operator in the SO(6) and SU(2|3) sectors using techniques\noriginally designed for amplitudes. A second part of the work is dedicated to\nthe study of scattering amplitudes beyond the planar limit, an area of research\nwhich is still in its infancy, and not much is known about which special\nfeatures of the planar theory survive in the non-planar regime. In this\ncontext, we generalise some aspects of the on-shell diagram formulation of\nArkani-Hamed et al. to take into account non-planar corrections.\n", "  The Li\\'{e}nard equation is of a high importance from both mathematical and\nphysical points of view. However a question about integrability of this\nequation has not been completely answered yet. Here we provide a new criterion\nfor integrability of the Li\\'{e}nard equation using an approach based on\nnonlocal transformations. We also obtain some of previously known criteria for\nintegrability of the Li\\'{e}nard equation as a straightforward consequences of\nour approach's application. We illustrate our results by several new examples\nof integrable Li\\'{e}nard equations.\n", "  In the past two decades, under the conditions that both the osmotic pressure\n$\\Delta p$ and tensile stress $\\lambda$ equal zero, a rigorous solution (RS) of\nhuman red blood cell (RBC) with a minus spontaneous curvature $c_{0}$ has been\nderived with Helfrich model. And, by fitting with observed shapes of RBC,\n$c_{0}R_{0}$ has been predicted to be -1.62 as minus golden ratio, where\n$R_{0}$ is the radius of a sphere with the same area of RBC. In this Lett., it\nis also found $\\rho_{max}$ /$\\rho_{B}\\approx$ 1.6 shows a approximately\nbeautiful golden cross section of RBC, where $\\rho_{max}$ is the radius of RBC\nand $\\rho_{B}$ is the radius at maximal thickness of RBC. With a complete\nnumerical calculation, we find the mechanism behind the beauty that minus\ngolden ratio of $c_{0}R_{0}$ is the balance between economical surface area and\nenough deformability to pass spleen, the so called \"physical fitness test\".\n", "  I discuss progress towards \"bootstrapping\" a Lorentz-violating gravity\ntheory: namely, extending a linear Lorentz-violating theory of a rank-2 tensor\nto a non-linear theory by coupling this field to its own stress-energy tensor.\n", "  The confinement of liquid crystals inside curved geometries leads to exotic\nstructures, with applications ranging from bio-sensors to optical switches and\nprivacy windows. Here we study how curvature affects the alignment of a\ncholesteric liquid crystal. We model the system on the mesoscale using the\nLandau-de Gennes model. Our study was performed in three stages, analysing\ndifferent curved geometries from cylindrical walls and pores, to toroidal\ndomains, in order to isolate the curvature effects. Our results show that the\nstresses introduced by the curvature influence the orientation of the liquid\ncrystal molecules, and cause distortions in the natural periodicity of the\ncholesteric that depend on the radius of curvature and on the commensurability\nbetween the pitch and the dimensions of the system. In particular, the\ncholesteric layers of toroidal droplets exhibit a symmetry breaking not seen in\ncylindrical pores and that is driven by the additional curvature.\n", "  Estimates of the black hole mass $M$ and dimensionless spin $a$ in the\nmicroquasar GRO J1655-40 implied by strong gravity effects related to the\ntiming and spectral measurements are controversial, if the mass restriction\ndetermined by the dynamics related to independent optical measurements, $M_{\\rm\nopt}=(5.4\\pm0.3) M_{\\odot}$, are applied. The timing measurements of twin\nhigh-frequency (HF) quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) with frequency ratio\n$3:2$ and the simultaneously observed low-frequency (LF) QPO imply the spin in\nthe range $a\\in(0.27-0.29)$ if models based on the frequencies of the geodesic\nepicyclic motion are used to fit the timing measurements, and correlated\ncreation of the twin HF QPOs and the LF QPO at a common radius is assumed. On\nthe other hand, the spectral continuum method implies $a\\in(0.65-0.75)$, and\nthe Fe-line-profile method implies $a\\in(0.94-0.98)$. This controversy can be\ncured, if we abandon the assumption of the occurrence of the twin HF QPOs and\nthe simultaneously observed LF QPO at a common radius. We demonstrate that the\nepicyclic resonance model of the twin HF QPOs is able to predict the spin in\nagreement with the Fe-profile method, but no model based on the geodesic\nepicyclic frequencies can be in agreement with the spectral continuum method.\nWe also show that the non-geodesic string loop oscillation model of twin HF\nQPOs predicts spin $a>0.3$ under the optical measurement limit on the black\nhole mass, in agreement with both the spectral continuum and Fe-profile\nmethods.\n", "  X-ray scattering measurements on single crystals of TiOCl reveal the presence\nof commensurate dimerization peaks within both the incommensurate spin-Peierls\nphase and the so-called pseudogap phase above T_c2. This scattering is\nrelatively narrow in Q-space indicating long correlation lengths exceeding ~\n100 A below T* ~ 130 K. It is also slightly shifted in Q relative to that of\nthe commensurate long range ordered state at the lowest temperatures, and it\ncoexists with the incommensurate Bragg peaks below T_c2. The integrated\nscattering over both commensurate and incommensurate positions evolves\ncontinuously with decreasing temperature for all temperatures below T* ~ 130 K.\n", "  An accurate simulation of the propagation of muons through matter is needed\nfor the analysis of data produced by muon/neutrino underground experiments. A\nmuon may sustain hundreds of interactions before it is detected by the\nexperiment. Since a small systematic uncertainty repeated hundreds of times may\nlead to sizable errors, requirements on the precision of the muon propagation\ncode are very stringent. A new tool for propagating muon and tau charged\nleptons through matter that is believed to meet these requirements is presented\nhere. An overview of the program is given and some results of its application\nare discussed.\n"]}
