experienced by a system superposition state in the regime of strong\nsystem- environment coupling. As an example of this general approach, a generic\nsystem comprising spin-half particles interacting with a thermalized oscillator\nenvironment is considered. We find that (a) amongst the collection of\nparametrized Hamiltonians, the larger the overlapping resonances contribution,\nthe greater the maximum possible purity, and (b) for a fixed Hamiltonian, the\nlarger the overlapping resonances contribution, the larger the range of\npossible values of the purity as one varies the phases in the system\nsuperposition states. Systems displaying decoherence free subspaces show that\nlargest overlapping resonances contribution.\n", "  We suggest a novel discretisation of the momentum equation for Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and show that it significantly improves the\naccuracy of the obtained solutions. Our new formulation which we refer to as\nrelative pressure SPH, rpSPH, evaluates the pressure force in respect to the\nlocal pressure. It respects Newtons first law of motion and applies forces to\nparticles only when there is a net force acting upon them. This is in contrast\nto standard SPH which explicitly uses Newtons third law of motion continuously\napplying equal but opposite forces between particles. rpSPH does not show the\nunphysical particle noise, the clumping or banding instability, unphysical\nsurface tension, and unphysical scattering of different mass particles found\nfor standard SPH. At the same time it uses fewer computational operations. and\nonly changes a single line in existing SPH codes. We demonstrate its\nperformance on isobaric uniform density distributions, uniform density shearing\nflows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the Sod shock\ntube, the Sedov-Taylor blast wave and a cosmological integration of the Santa\nBarbara galaxy cluster formation test. rpSPH is an improvement these cases. The\nimprovements come at the cost of giving up exact momentum conservation of the\nscheme. Consequently one can also obtain unphysical solutions particularly at\nlow resolutions.\n", "  We study the ground state of a finite size ensemble of interacting qubits\ndriven by a quantum field. We find a maximally entangled W-state in the\nensemble part of the system for a certain coupling parameters region. The area\nof this region decreases as the ensemble size increases and, in the classical\nlimit, becomes the line in parameter space that defines the phase transition of\nthe system. In the classical limit, we also study the dynamics of the system\nand its transition from order to disorder for initial energies close to the\nground state energy. We find that a critical energy providing this transition\nis related to the minimum of the projection of the total angular momentum of\nthe quantum system in the $z$-direction.\n", "  Depletion-induced aggregation of rods enhanced by clustering is observed to\nproduce a novel model of attractive pairs of rods separated by a line of\nspheres in a quasi-2D, vertically-shaken, granular gas of rods and spheres. We\nshow that the stability of these peculiar granular aggregates increases as a\nfunction of shaking intensity. Velocity distributions of spheres inside and\noutside of a pair of rods trapping a line of spheres show a clear suppression\nof the momentum acquired by the trapped spheres. The condensed phase formed\nbetween the rods is caused by a clustering instability of the trapped spheres,\nenhanced by a vertical guidance produced by the confining rods. The liberated\narea corresponding to direct excluded-volume pairs and indirect\ndepletion-aggregated pairs is measured as a function of time. The stability of\nrod pairs mediated by spheres reveals an attraction comparable in strength to\nthe one purely induced by depletion forces.\n", "  We study a problem of interconvertibility of two supra-quantum resources: one\nis so called PR-box, which violates CHSH inequality up to maximal algebraic\nbound, and second is so called random access code (RAC). The latter is a\nfunctionality that enables Bob (receiver) to choose one of two bits of Alice.\nIt has been known, that PR-box supplemented with one bit of communication can\nbe used to simulate RAC. We ask the converse question: to what extent RAC can\nsimulate PR-box? To this end we introduce racbox: a box such that supplemented\nwith one bit of communication offers RAC. As said, PR-box can simulate racbox.\nThe question we raise, is whether any racbox can simulate PR-box. We show that\na non-signaling racbox indeed can simulate PR-box, hence those two resources\nare equivalent. We also provide an example of signalling racbox which cannot\nsimulate PR-box. We give a resource inequality between racbox es and PR-boxes,\nand show that it is saturated.\n", "  We provide a differential cocycle model for elliptic cohomology with complex\ncoefficients and use analytic methods to construct a cocycle representative for\nthe Witten class in this language. Our motivation stems from the conjectural\nconnection between 2-dimensional field theories and elliptic cohomology\noriginally due to G. Segal and E. Witten. The specifics of our constructions\nare informed by the work of S. Stolz and P. Teichner on super Euclidean field\ntheories and K. Costello's construction of the Witten genus using perturbative\nquantization. As a warm-up, we prove analogous results for supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics and K-theory with complex coefficients.\n", "  We present a new set of inseparabilty inequalities to detect entanglement in\n$N$-spin states. These are based on negative partial transposition and involve\ncollective spin-spin correlations of any two partitions of the entire system.\nThey also reveal the rich texture of partial separability for different\npartition and can discriminate between GHZ-type and W-type entanglement, as\nwell. We introduce a new concept of relative entanglement of two different\nsystems and two different partitions in a spin-ensemble. These criteria can be\napplicable to non-symmetric states and states with odd or even $N$.\n", "  Understanding the interplay between many-body phenomena and non-equilibrium\nin systems with entangled spin and orbital degrees of freedom is a central\nobjective in nano-electronics. We demonstrate that the combination of Coulomb\ninteraction, spin-orbit coupling and valley mixing results in a particular\nselection of the inelastic virtual processes contributing to the Kondo\nresonance in carbon nanotubes at low temperatures. This effect is dictated by\nconjugation properties of the underlying carbon nanotube spectrum at zero and\nfinite magnetic field. Our measurements on a clean carbon nanotube are\ncomplemented by calculations based on a new approach to the non-equilibrium\nKondo problem which well reproduces the rich experimental observations in Kondo\ntransport.\n", "  We consider renormalization group flows between conformal field theories in\nfive (six) dimensions with a string (M-theory) dual. By compactifying on a\ncircle (torus) with appropriate boundary conditions, we obtain continuous\nfamilies of confining four-dimensional theories parametrized by the ratio\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm {\\tiny flow}}/\\Lambda_{\\rm \\tiny{QCD}}$, with $\\Lambda_{\\rm\n\\tiny{flow}}$ the scale at which the flow between fixed points takes place and\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm \\tiny{QCD}}$ the confinement scale. We construct the dual\ngeometries explicitly and compute the spectrum of scalar bound states\n(glueballs). We find a `universal' subset of states common to all the models.\nWe comment on the modifications of these models, and the corresponding\nfine-tuning, required for a parametrically light `dilaton' state to be present.\nWe also comment on some aspects of these theories as probed by extended objects\nsuch as strings and branes.\n", "  We study the passive influence of quantum matter fluctuations on the\nexpansion parameter of a congruence of timelike geodesics in a semiclassical\nregime. In particular, we show that, the perturbations of this parameter can be\nconsidered to be elements of the algebra of matter fields at all perturbative\norder. Hence, once a quantum state for matter is chosen, it is possible to\nexplicitly evaluate the behavior of geometric fluctuations. After introducing\nthe formalism necessary to treat similar problems, in the last part of the\npaper, we estimate the approximated probability of having a geodesic collapse\nin a flat spacetime due to those fluctuations.\n", "  We study the capture of galactic dark matter particles (DMP) in two-body and\nfew-body systems with a symplectic map description. This approach allows\nmodeling the scattering of $10^{16}$ DMPs after following the time evolution of\nthe captured particle on about $10^9$ orbital periods of the binary system. We\nobtain the DMP density distribution inside such systems and determine the\nenhancement factor of their density in a center vicinity compared to its\ngalactic value as a function of the mass ratio of the bodies and the ratio of\nthe body velocity to the velocity of the galactic DMP wind. We find that the\nenhancement factor can be on the order of tens of thousands.\n", "  We employ Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the non-equilibrium\nrelaxation properties of the two- and three-dimensional Coulomb glass with\ndifferent long-range repulsive interactions. Specifically, we explore the aging\nscaling laws in the two-time density autocorrelation function. We find that in\nthe time window and parameter range accessible to us, the scaling exponents are\nnot universal, depending on the filling fraction and temperature: As either the\ntemperature decreases or the filling fraction deviates more from half-filling,\nthe exponents reflect markedly slower relaxation kinetics. In comparison with a\nrepulsive Coulomb potential, appropriate for impurity states in strongly\ndisordered semiconductors, we observe that for logarithmic interactions, the\nsoft pseudo-gap in the density of states is considerably broader, and the\ndependence of the scaling exponents on external parameters is much weaker. The\nlatter situation is relevant for flux creep in the disorder-dominated Bose\nglass phase of type-II superconductors subject to columnar pinning centers.\n", "  We study the fluctuations of random surfaces on a two-dimensional discrete\ntorus. The random surfaces we consider are defined via a nearest-neighbor pair\npotential which we require to be twice continuously differentiable on a\n(possibly infinite) interval and infinity outside of this interval. No\nconvexity assumption is made and we include the case of the so-called hammock\npotential, when the random surface is uniformly chosen from the set of all\nsurfaces satisfying a Lipschitz constraint. Our main result is that these\nsurfaces delocalize, having fluctuations whose variance is at least of order\n$\\log n$, where $n$ is the side length of the torus. We also show that the\nexpected maximum of such surfaces is of order at least $\\log n$. The main tool\nin our analysis is an adaptation to the lattice setting of an algorithm of\nRichthammer, who developed a variant of a Mermin-Wagner-type argument\napplicable to hard-core constraints. We rely also on the reflection positivity\nof the random surface model. The result answers a question mentioned by\nBrascamp, Lieb and Lebowitz 1975 on the hammock potential and a question of\nVelenik 2006.\n", "  The second generation of large scale interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors will be limited by quantum noise over a wide frequency range in their\ndetection band. Further sensitivity improvements for future upgrades or new\ndetectors beyond the second generation motivate the development of measurement\nschemes to mitigate the impact of quantum noise in these instruments. Two\nstrands of development are being pursued to reach this goal, focusing both on\nmodifications of the well-established Michelson detector configuration and\ndevelopment of different detector topologies. In this paper, we present the\ndesign of the world's first Sagnac speed meter interferometer which is\ncurrently being constructed at the University of Glasgow. With this\nproof-of-principle experiment we aim to demonstrate the theoretically predicted\nlower quantum noise in a Sagnac interferometer compared to an equivalent\nMichelson interferometer, to qualify Sagnac speed meters for further research\ntowards an implementation in a future generation large scale gravitational wave\ndetector, such as the planned Einstein Telescope observatory.\n", "  The smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique is a numerical method for\nsolving gas-dynamical problems. It has been applied to simulate the evolution\nof a wide variety of astrophysical systems. The method has a second-order\naccuracy, with a resolution that is usually much higher in the compressed\nregions than in the diluted zones of the fluid. In this work, we propose and\ncheck a scheme to balance and equalize the resolution of SPH between high- and\nlow-density regions. This method relies on the versatility of a family of\ninterpolators called Sinc kernels, which allows increasing the interpolation\nquality by varying only a single parameter (the exponent of the Sinc function).\nThe scheme is checked and validated through a number of numerical tests, from\nstandard one-dimensional Riemann problems in shock tubes, to multidimensional\nsimulations of explosions, hydrodynamic instabilities and the collapse of a\nsun-like polytrope. The analysis of the hydrodynamical simulations suggests\nthat the scheme devised to equalizing accuracy improves the treatment of the\npost-shock regions and, in general, of the rarefacted zones of fluids while\ncausing no harm to the growth of hydrodynamic instabilities. The method is\nrobust and easy to implement with a low computational overload. It conserves\nmass, energy, and momentum and reduces to the standard SPH scheme in regions of\nthe fluid that have smooth density gradients.\n", "  Many real world systems can be expressed as complex networks of\ninterconnected nodes. It is frequently important to be able to quantify the\nrelative importance of the various nodes in the network, a task accomplished by\ndefining some centrality measures, with different centrality definitions\nstressing different aspects of the network. It is interesting to know to what\nextent these different centrality definitions are related for different\nnetworks. In this work, we study the correlation between pairs of a set of\ncentrality measures for different real world networks and two network models.\nWe show that the centralities are in general correlated, but with stronger\ncorrelations for network models than for real networks. We also show that the\nstrength of the correlation of each pair of centralities varies from network to\nnetwork. Taking this fact into account, we propose the use of a centrality\ncorrelation profile, consisting of the values of the correlation coefficients\nbetween all pairs of centralities of interest, as a way to characterize\nnetworks. Using the yeast protein interaction network as an example we show\nalso that the centrality correlation profile can be used to assess the adequacy\nof a network model as a representation of a given real network.\n", "  We further investigate slowing down of acceleration of the universe scenario\nfor five parametrizations of the equation of state of dark energy using four\nsets of supernovae data. In a maximal probability analysis we also use the\nbaryon acoustic oscillation and cosmic microwave background observations. We\nfound the low redshift transition of the deceleration parameter appears,\nindependently of the parametrization, using supernovae data alone except for\nthe Union 2.1 sample. This feature disappears once we combine the supernova\ndata with high redshift data. We conclude that the rapid variation of the\ndeceleration parameter is independent of the parametrization. We also found\nmore evidence for a tension among the supernovae samples, as well as for the\nlow and high redshift data.\n", "  We investigate the gluon, ghost and quark propagators in the Landau gauge\nwith dynamic quarks. We perform a one-loop calculation in a model where the\nstandard Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian is complemented by a mass term for the gluons\nwhich is seen as a minimal way of taking into account the effect of the Gribov\ncopies. The analytic results are compared with lattice data obtained in four\ndimension and for two, three and four quark flavors. The gluon and ghost\npropagators are reproduced with a few percent accuracy in the whole range of\naccessible momenta. The scalar part of the quark propagator is found to be in\ngood agreement with the lattice data. However, the quark renormalization is\npoorly described. We attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the one-loop\ncorrections to this quantity are unusually small so that the two loop\ncontribution can not be discarded. The results are expressed in terms of the\ncoupling, the gluon mass and the light quark mass at 1 GeV.\n", "  The necessity of quantising the gravitational field is still subject to an\nopen debate. In this paper we compare the approach of quantum gravity, with\nthat of a fundamentally semi-classical theory of gravity, in the weak-field\nnon-relativistic limit. We show that, while in the former case the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation stays linear, in the latter case one ends up with the\nso-called Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation, which involves a nonlinear, non-local\ngravitational contribution. We further discuss that the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton\nequation does not describe the collapse of the wave-function, although it was\ninitially proposed for exactly this purpose. Together with the standard\ncollapse postulate, fundamentally semi-classical gravity gives rise to\nsuperluminal signalling. A consistent fundamentally semi-classical theory of\ngravity can therefore only be achieved together with a suitable prescription of\nthe wave-function collapse. We further discuss, how collapse models avoid such\nsuperluminal signalling and compare the nonlinearities appearing in these\nmodels with those in the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation.\n", "  In order to study the interplay between localized and dispersive orbital\nstates in a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we investigate the\npossibility to coherently couple the lowest two Bloch bands by means of\nresonant periodic forcing. Considering bosons in one dimension, it is shown\nthat a strongly interacting Floquet system can be realized, where at every\nlattice site two (and only two) near-degenerate orbital states are relevant. By\nsmoothly tuning both states into resonance we find that the system can undergo\nan orbital-driven Mott-insulator-to-superfluid transition. As an intriguing\nconsequence of the kinetic frustration in the system, this transition can be\neither continuous or first-order, depending on parameters such as lattice depth\nand filling.\n", "  We present a general formalism for incorporating the string corrections in\ngeneralised geometry, which necessitates the extension of the generalised\ntangent bundle. Not only are such extensions obstructed, string symmetries and\nthe existence of a well-defined effective action require a precise choice of\nthe (generalised) connection. The action takes a universal form given by a\ngeneralised Lichnerowitz--Bismut theorem. As examples of this construction we\ndiscuss the corrections linear in $\\alpha'$ in heterotic strings and the\nabsence of such corrections for type II theories.\n", "  In this report we explore the remarkable connections between light-front\ndynamics, its holographic mapping to gravity in a higher-dimensional anti-de\nSitter (AdS) space, and conformal quantum mechanics. This approach provides new\ninsights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying\nconfinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a\nrelativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective\nconfinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS\nspace. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron\nspectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods\ndescribed here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and\nquantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This\nleads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant\nlight-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound\nstates in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states\nlie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and\norbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here\ncurrents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a\nproduct of poles. At large $q^2$ the form factor incorporates the correct\npower-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and\nis dictated by the twist. At low $q^2$ the form factor leads to vector\ndominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses. We\nbriefly review in this report other holographic approaches to QCD, in\nparticular top-down and bottom-up models based on chiral symmetry breaking. We\nalso include a discussion of open problems and future applications.\n", "  Using femtosecond time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy we demonstrate\nthat photoexcitation transforms monoclinic VO$_2$ quasi-instantaneously into a\nmetal. Thereby, we exclude an 80 femtosecond structural bottleneck for the\nphotoinduced electronic phase transition of VO$_2$. First-principles many-body\nperturbation theory calculations reveal a high sensitivity of the VO$_2$\nbandgap to variations of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction,\nsupporting a fully electronically driven isostructral insulator-to-metal\ntransition. We thus conclude that the ultrafast band structure renormalization\nis caused by photoexcitation of carriers from localized V 3d valence states,\nstrongly changing the screening \\emph{before} significant hot-carrier\nrelaxation or ionic motion has occurred.\n", "  Motivated by recent studies suggesting that the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\ncould be significantly more massive than previously thought, we explore whether\nthe approximation of an inertial Galactocentric reference frame is still valid\nin the presence of such a massive LMC. We find that previous estimates of the\nLMC's orbital period and apocentric distance derived assuming a fixed Milky Way\nare significantly shortened for models where the Milky Way is allowed to move\nfreely in response to the gravitational pull of the LMC. Holding other\nparameters fixed, the fraction of models favoring first infall is reduced. Due\nto this interaction, the Milky Way center of mass within the inner 50 kpc can\nbe significantly displaced in phase-space in a very short period of time that\nranges from 0.3 to 0.5 Gyr by as much as 30 kpc and 75 km/s. Furthermore, we\nshow that the gravitational pull of the LMC and response of the Milky Way are\nlikely to significantly affect the orbit and phase space distribution of tidal\ndebris from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr). Such effects are larger than\nprevious estimates based on the torque of the LMC alone. As a result, Sgr\ndeposits debris in regions of the sky that are not aligned with the present-day\nSgr orbital plane. In addition, we find that properly accounting for the\nmovement of the Milky Way around its common center of mass with the LMC\nsignificantly modifies the angular distance between apocenters and tilts its\norbital pole, alleviating tensions between previous models and observations.\nWhile these models are preliminary in nature, they highlight the central\nimportance of accounting for the mutual gravitational interaction between the\nMW and LMC when modeling the kinematics of objects in the Milky Way and Local\nGroup.\n", "  On-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are performed to investigate\nslow relaxation of non-equilibrium systems. Point defects induced by 25 keV\ncascades in $\\alpha$-Fe are shown to lead to a characteristic time-evolution,\ndescribed by the \\emph{replenish and relax} mechanism. Then, we produce an\natomistically-based assessment of models proposed to explain the slow\nstructural relaxation by focusing on the aggregation of 50 vacancies and 25\nself-interstital atoms (SIA) in 10-lattice-parameter $\\alpha$-Fe boxes, two\nprocesses that are closely related to cascade annealing and exhibit similar\ntime signature. Four atomistic effects explain the timescales involved in the\nevolution: defect concentration heterogeneities, concentration-enhanced\nmobility, cluster-size dependent bond energies and defect-induced pressure.\nThese findings suggest that the two main classes of models to explain slow\nstructural relaxation, the Eyring model and the Gibbs model, both play a role\nto limit the rate of relaxation of these simple point-defect systems.\n", "  Relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of quark-gluon plasma play a pivotal\nrole in our understanding of heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. They are\nbased on a phenomenological description due to Mueller, Israel, Stewart (MIS)\nand others, which incorporates viscous effects and ensures a well-posed initial\nvalue problem. Focusing on the case of conformal plasma we propose a\ngeneralization which includes, in addition, the dynamics of the least damped\nfar-from-equilibrium degree of freedom found in strongly coupled plasmas\nthrough the AdS/CFT correspondence. We formulate new evolution equations for\ngeneral flows and then test them in the case of N=4 super Yang-Mills plasma by\ncomparing their solutions alongside solutions of MIS theory with numerical\ncomputations of isotropization and boost-invariant flow based on holography. In\nthese tests the new equations reproduce the results of MIS theory when\ninitialized close to the hydrodynamic stage of evolution, but give a more\naccurate description of the dynamics when initial conditions are set in the\npre-equilibrium regime.\n", "  We derive explicit, closed-form expressions for the cumulant densities of a\nmultivariate, self-exciting Hawkes point process, generalizing a result of\nHawkes in his earlier work on the covariance density and Bartlett spectrum of\nsuch processes. To do this, we represent the Hawkes process in terms of a\nPoisson cluster process and show how the cumulant density formulas can be\nderived by enumerating all possible \"family trees\", representing complex\ninteractions between point events. We also consider the problem of computing\nthe integrated cumulants, characterizing the average measure of correlated\nactivity between events of different types, and derive the relevant equations.\n", "  Context: In astronomy, new approaches to process and analyze the\nexponentially increasing amount of data are inevitable. While classical\napproaches (e.g. template fitting) are fine for objects of well-known classes,\nalternative techniques have to be developed to determine those that do not fit.\nTherefore a classification scheme should be based on individual properties\ninstead of fitting to a global model and therefore loose valuable information.\nAn important issue when dealing with large data sets is the outlier detection\nwhich at the moment is often treated problem-orientated. Aims: In this paper we\npresent a method to statistically estimate the redshift z based on a similarity\napproach. This allows us to determine redshifts in spectra in emission as well\nas in absorption without using any predefined model. Additionally we show how\nan estimate of the redshift based on single features is possible. As a\nconsequence we are e.g. able to filter objects which show multiple redshift\ncomponents. We propose to apply this general method to all similar problems in\norder to identify objects where traditional approaches fail. Methods: The\nredshift estimation is performed by comparing predefined regions in the spectra\nand applying a k nearest neighbor regression model for every predefined\nemission and absorption region, individually. Results: We estimated a redshift\nfor more than 50% of the analyzed 16,000 spectra of our reference and test\nsample. The redshift estimate yields a precision for every individually tested\nfeature that is comparable with the overall precision of the redshifts of SDSS.\nIn 14 spectra we find a significant shift between emission and absorption or\nemission and emission lines. The results show already the immense power of this\nsimple machine learning approach for investigating huge databases such as the\nSDSS.\n", "  The formation of a new type of laser-induced periodic surface structures\nusing a femtosecond pulsed laser is studied on the basis of the Sipe-Drude\ntheory solved with a FDTD scheme. Our numerical results indicate the\npossibility of coexisting structures parallel and perpendicular to the\npolarization of the incident light for low reduced collision frequency\n($\\gamma/\\omega \\lesssim 1/4$, where $\\omega$ is the laser frequency).\nMoreover, these structures have a periodicity of $\\Lambda \\sim \\lambda$ in both\norientations. To explain this behavior, light-matter interaction around a\nsingle surface inhomogeneity is also studied and confirms the simultaneous\npresence of surface plasmon polaritons and radiation remnants in orthogonal\norientations at low $\\gamma/\\omega$ values.\n", "  The determination of the birth radius of the Sun is important to understand\nthe evolution and consequent disruption of the Sun's birth cluster in the\nGalaxy. Motivated by this fact, we study the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way\nduring the last 4.6 Gyr in order to find its birth radius. We carried out orbit\nintegrations backward in time using an analytical model of the Galaxy which\nincludes the contribution of spiral arms and a central bar. We took into\naccount the uncertainty in the parameters of the Milky Way potential as well as\nthe uncertainty in the present day position and velocity of the Sun. We find\nthat in general the Sun has not migrated from its birth place to its current\nposition in the Galaxy (R_\\odot). However, significant radial migration of the\nSun is possible when: 1) The 2:1 Outer Lindblad resonance of the bar is\nseparated from the corrotation resonance of spiral arms by a distance ~1 kpc.\n2) When these two resonances are at the same Galactocentric position and\nfurther than the solar radius. In both cases the migration of the Sun is from\nouter regions of the Galactic disk to R_\\odot, placing the Sun's birth radius\nat around 11 kpc. We find that in general it is unlikely that the Sun has\nmigrated significantly from the inner regions of the Galactic disk to R_\\odot.\n", "  We consider a modification of the Fukuyama-Nishiura texture and compare it to\nthe precision quark flavour data, finding that it fits the data very well but\nat the cost of accidental cancelations between parameters. We then propose\ndifferent viable textures for quarks, where only the Cabibbo mixing arises from\nthe down sector, and extend to the charged leptons while constructing a\ncomplementary neutrino structure that leads to viable lepton masses and mixing.\n", "  Fast magnetic reconnection events can be a very powerful mechanism operating\nin the core region of microquasars and AGNs. In earlier work, it has been\nsuggested that the power released by fast reconnection events between the\nmagnetic field lines lifting from the inner accretion disk region and the lines\nanchored into the central black hole could accelerate relativistic particles\nand produce the observed radio emission from microquasars and low luminosity\nAGNs (LLAGNs). Moreover, it has been proposed that the observed correlation\nbetween the radio emission and the mass of these sources, spanning $10^{10}$\norders of magnitude in mass, might be related to this process. In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected.\n", "  We study time-dependent density fluctuations in the stationary state of\ndriven diffusive systems with two conserved densities $\\rho_\\lambda$. Using\nMonte-Carlo simulations of two coupled single-lane asymmetric simple exclusion\nprocesses we present numerical evidence for universality classes with dynamical\nexponents $z=(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ and $z=3/2$ (but different from the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class), which have not been reported yet\nfor driven diffusive systems. The numerical asymmetry of the dynamical\nstructure functions converges slowly for some of the non-KPZ superdiffusive\nmodes for which mode coupling theory predicts maximally asymmetric $z$-stable\nL\\'evy scaling functions. We show that all universality classes predicted by\nmode coupling theory for two conservation laws are generic: They occur in\ntwo-component systems with nonlinearities in the associated currents already of\nthe minimal order $\\rho_\\lambda^2\\rho_\\mu$. The macroscopic stationary\ncurrent-density relation and the compressibility matrix determine completely\nall permissible universality classes through the mode coupling coefficients\nwhich we compute explicitly for general two-component systems.\n", "  We analyze the fragmentation behavior of random clusters on the lattice under\na process where bonds between neighboring sites are successively broken.\nModeling such structures by configurations of a generalized Potts or\nrandom-cluster model allows us to discuss a wide range of systems with fractal\nproperties including trees as well as dense clusters. We present exact results\nfor the densities of fragmenting edges and the distribution of fragment sizes\nfor critical clusters in two dimensions. Dynamical fragmentation with a size\ncutoff leads to broad distributions of fragment sizes. The resulting power laws\nare shown to encode characteristic fingerprints of the fragmented objects.\n", "  It is commonly believed that area laws for entanglement entropies imply that\na quantum many-body state can be faithfully represented by efficient tensor\nnetwork states - a conjecture frequently stated in the context of numerical\nsimulations and analytical considerations. In this work, we show that this is\nin general not the case, except in one dimension. We prove that the set of\nquantum many-body states that satisfy an area law for all Renyi entropies\ncontains a subspace of exponential dimension. Establishing a novel link between\nquantum many-body theory and the theory of communication complexity, we then\nshow that there are states satisfying area laws for all Renyi entropies but\ncannot be approximated by states with a classical description of small\nKolmogorov complexity, including polynomial projected entangled pair states\n(PEPS) or states of multi-scale entanglement renormalisation (MERA). Not even a\nquantum computer with post-selection can efficiently prepare all quantum states\nfulfilling an area law, and we show that not all area law states can be\neigenstates of local Hamiltonians. We also prove translationally invariant and\nisotropic instances of these results, and show a variation with decaying\ncorrelations using quantum error-correcting codes.\n", "  We consider a quintessence model for dark energy interacting with dark matter\nvia a Yukawa interaction. To put constraints on this model we use the CMB\nmeasurements from the Planck satellite together with BAO, SNIa and $H_0$ data.\nWe conclude that this is a viable model and an appropriate scalar potential can\nfavor the interacting scenario.\n", "  Capacitive mixing (CAPMIX) and capacitive deionization (CDI) are promising\ncandidates for harvesting clean, renewable energy and for the energy efficient\nproduction of potable water, respectively. Both CAPMIX and CDI involve\nwater-immersed porous carbon (supercapacitors) electrodes at voltages of the\norder of hundreds of millivolts, such that counter-ionic packing is important\nfor the electric double layer (EDL) which forms near the surface of these\nporous materials. Thus, we propose a density functional theory (DFT) to model\nthe EDL, where the White-Bear mark II fundamental measure theory functional is\ncombined with a mean-field Coulombic and a mean spherical approximation-type\ncorrection to describe the interplay between dense packing and electrostatics,\nin good agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. We discuss the\nconcentration-dependent potential rise due to changes in the chemical potential\nin capacitors in the context of an over-ideal theoretical description and its\nimpact on energy harvesting and water desalination. Compared to less elaborate\nmean-field models our DFT calculations reveal a higher work output for\nblue-energy cycles and a higher energy demand for desalination cycles.\n", "  The theoretically studied impact of rapid rotation on stellar evolution needs\nto be confronted with the results of high resolution spectroscopy-velocimetry\nobservations. A weak surface magnetic field had recently been detected in the\nA0 prototype star Vega, potentially leading to a (yet undetected) structured\nsurface. The goal of this article is to present a thorough analysis of the line\nprofile variations and associated estimators in the early-type standard star\nVega (A0) in order reveal potential activity tracers, exoplanet companions and\nstellar oscillations. Vega was monitored in high-resolution spectroscopy with\nthe velocimeter Sophie/OHP. A total of 2588 high S/N spectra was obtained\nduring 5 nights (August 2012) at R = 75000 and covering the visible domain. For\neach reduced spectrum, Least Square Deconvolved (LSD) equivalent photospheric\nprofiles were calculated with a Teff = 9500 and logg = 4.0 spectral line mask.\nSeveral methods were applied to study the dynamic behavior of the profile\nvariations (evolution of radial velocity, bisectors, vspan, 2D profiles,\namongst others). We present the discovery of a starspotted stellar surface in\nan A-type standard star with faint spot amplitudes Delta F/Fc ~5 10^{-4}. A\nrotational modulation of spectral lines with a period of rotation P = 0.68 d\nhas clearly been exhibited, confirming the results of previous\nspectropolarimetric studies. Either a very thin convective layer can be\nresponsible for magnetic field generation at small amplitudes, or a new\nmechanism has to be invoked in order to explain the existence of activity\ntracing starspots. This first strong evidence that standard A-type stars can\nshow surface structures opens a new field of research and asks the question\nabout a potential link with the recently discovered weak magnetic field\ndiscoveries in this category of stars.\n", "  We present a holographic construction of the large-N Bose-Hubbard model. The\nmodel is based on Maxwell fields coupled to charged scalar fields on the AdS2\nhard wall. We realize the lobe-shaped phase structure of the Bose-Hubbard model\nand find that the model admits Mott insulator ground states in the limit of\nlarge Coulomb repulsion. In the Mott insulator phases, the bosons are localized\non each site. At zero hopping we find that the transitions between Mott\ninsulating phases with different fillings correspond to first order\nlevel-crossing phase transitions. At finite hopping we find a holographic phase\ntransition between the Mott phase and a non-homogeneous phase. We then analyze\nthe perturbations of fields around both the Mott insulator phase and\ninhomogeneous phase. We find almost zero modes in the non-homogeneous phase.\n", "  In this work we investigate the Blume-Capel model with infinite-range\nferromagnetic interactions and under the influence of a quenched disorder - a\nrandom crystal field. For a suitable choice of the random crystal field the\nmodel displays a wealth of multicritical behavior, continuous and first-order\ntransition lines, as well as re-entrant behavior. The resulting phase diagrams\nshow a variety of topologies as a function of the disorder parameter\n$\\textit{p}$. A comparison with recent results on the Blume-Capel model in\nrandom crystal field is discussed.\n", "  Constraints to the parameters of inflation models are often derived assuming\nsome plausible range for the number--e.g., $N_k=46$ to $N_k=60$--of $e$-folds\nof inflation that occurred between the time that our current observable\nUniverse exited the horizon and the end of inflation. However, that number is,\nfor any specific inflaton potential, related to an effective equation-of-state\nparameter $w_{\\mathrm{re}}$ and temperature $T_{\\mathrm{re}}$, for reheating.\nAlthough the physics of reheating is highly uncertain, there is a finite range\nof reasonable values for $w_{\\mathrm{re}}$. Here we show that by restricting\n$w_{\\mathrm{re}}$ to this range, more stringent constraints to inflation-model\nparameters can be derived than those obtained from the usual procedure. To do\nso, we focus in this work in particular on natural inflation and inflation with\na Higgs-like potential, and on power law models as limiting cases of those. As\none example, we show that the lower limit to the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$,\nderived from current measurements of the scalar spectral index, is about\n20%-25% higher (depending on the model) with this procedure than with the usual\napproach.\n", "  We develop a higher-order perturbation theory for large-scale structure\nformation involving a free-streaming hot or warm dark matter species. We focus\non the case of mixed cold dark matter and massive neutrinos, although our\napproach is applicable also to a single warm dark matter species. In order to\ncapture the suppressed growth of neutrino density perturbations on small\nscales, we account for the full momentum dependence of the phase space\ndistribution using the Vlaslov equation, and derive from it a formal\nclosed-form nonlinear equation for the neutrino density. Using a systematic\nperturbative expansion of this equation we compute high-order corrections to\nthe neutrino density contrast without the explicit need to track the perturbed\nneutrino momentum distribution. We calculate the leading-order total matter\nbispectrum for several neutrino masses. Using our result as a benchmark, we\ntest the accuracy of the fluid approximation and a linear approximation used in\nperturbative and N-body analyses, as well as a new hybrid approach that\ncombines the exact linear evolution with the nonlinear structure of the fluid\nequations. Aiming at $\\lesssim1%$ accuracy, we find that the total matter\nbispectrum with a low neutrino mass m=0.046 eV can be reproduced by all but the\nfluid approximation, while for larger neutrino masses m=0.46-0.93 eV only the\nhybrid approach has the desired accuracy on a large range of scales. This\nresult serves as a cautionary note that approximate nonlinear models of\nneutrino clustering that reproduce the gross features of some observables may\nnot suffice for precision calculations, nor are they guaranteed to apply to\nother observables. All of the approximation schemes fail to reproduce the\nbispectrum of the neutrino density perturbations at better than 20% accuracy\nacross all scales, indicating that an exact treatment of nonlinear neutrino\nperturbations is necessary.\n", "  In the ONeMg cores of $8.8-9.5~{\\rm M}_\\odot$ stars, neon and oxygen burning\nis ignited off-center. Whether the neon-oxygen flame propagates to the center\nis critical to determine whether these stars undergo Fe core collapse or\nelectron capture induced ONeMg core collapse. We present more details of stars\nthat ignite neon and oxygen burning off-center. The neon flame is established\nin a similar manner to the carbon flame of super-AGB stars, albeit with a\nnarrower flame width. The criteria for establishing a flame are able to be met\nif the strict Schwarzschild criterion for convective instability is adopted.\nMixing across the interface of the convective shell disrupts the conditions for\nthe propagation of the burning front and instead the shell burns as a series of\ninward-moving flashes. While this may not directly affect whether the burning\nwill reach the center (as in super-AGB stars), the core is allowed to contract\nbetween each shell flash. Reduction of the electron fraction in the shell\nreduces the Chandrasekhar mass and the center reaches the threshold density for\nthe URCA process to activate and steer the remaining evolution of the core.\nThis highlights the importance of a more accurate treatment of mixing in the\nstellar interior for yet another important question in stellar astrophysics -\ndetermining the properties of stellar evolution and supernova progenitors at\nthe boundary between electron capture supernova and iron core-collapse\nsupernova.\n", "  We study the photoinduced manipulation of charge carriers in monolayer\nsilicene subject to intense electromagnetic terahertz radiation. Considering\nthe Dirac cone approximation and going beyond the off resonant condition for\nlarge frequencies of the radiation field, where only virtual photon processes\nare allowed, we present the exact zero-momentum pseudospin polarization and\nnumerical results for the quasienergy band structure and time-averaged density\nof states. We find that resonant processes, due to real photon emission and\nabsorbtion processes, induce a band inversion that qualitatively modifies the\nquasienergy spectrum. These band structure changes manifest themselves as an\ninversion of the averaged pseudospin polarization. Through the analysis of the\ntime-averaged density of states we find that effective photoinduced gap\nmanipulation can only be achieved in the intermediate and strong\nmatter-radiation coupling regime where the off resonant approximation breaks\ndown.\n", "  We present a simple method of generating approximate synthetic halo\ncatalogues: HALOGEN. This method uses a combination of $2^{nd}$-order\nLagrangian Perturbation Theory (2LPT) in order to generate the large-scale\nmatter distribution, analytical mass functions to generate halo masses, and a\nsingle-parameter stochastic model for halo bias to position haloes. HALOGEN\nrepresents a simplification of similar recently published methods.\n  Our method is constrained to recover the 2-point function at intermediate\n($10Mpc/h<r<50Mpc/h$) scales, which we show is successful to within 2 per cent.\nLarger scales ($\\sim100Mpc/h$) are reproduced to within 15 per cent. We compare\nseveral other statistics (e.g. power spectrum, point distribution function,\nredshift space distortions) with results from N-Body simulations to determine\nthe validity of our method for different purposes. One of the benefits of\nHALOGEN is its flexibility, and we demonstrate this by showing how it can be\nadapted to varying cosmologies and simulation specifications.\n  A driving motivation for the development of such approximate schemes is the\nneed to compute covariance matrices and study the systematic errors for large\ngalaxy surveys, which requires thousands of simulated realisations. We discuss\nthe applicability of our method in this context, and conclude that it is well\nsuited to mass production of appropriate halo catalogues.\n  The code is publicly available at https://github.com/savila/halogen\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the process of spontaneous parametric\ndown conversion (SPDC) in a non-linear crystal characterized by a\nlinearly-chirped X(2) grating along the direction of propagation. Our analysis\nleads to an expression for the joint spectral amplitude, based on which we can\nderive various spectral-temporal properties of the photon pairs and of the\nheralded single photons obtained from the photon pairs, including: the single\nphoton spectrum, the chronocyclic Wigner function and the Schmidt number. The\nsimulations that we present are for the specific case of a collinear SPDC\nsource based on a PPLN crystal with the signal and idler photons emitted close\nto the telecom window. We discuss the mechanism for spectral broadening due to\nthe presence of a linearly chirped X(2) grating, showing that not only the\nwidth but also to some extent the shape of the SPDC spectrum maybe controlled.\nAlso, we discuss how the fact that the different spectral components are\nemitted on different planes in the crystal leads to single-photon chirp.\n", "  This work presents a comprehensive overview of the physics of vector boson\nscattering (VBS) in the dawn of Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nRecalled here are some of its most basic physics principles, the historical\nrelation between vector boson scattering and the Higgs boson, then discussed is\nthe physics of VBS processes after Higgs discovery, and the prospects for\nfuture VBS measurements at the LHC and beyond. This monograph reviews the work\nof many people, including previously published theoretical work as well as\nexperimental results, but also contains a portion of original simulation-based\nstudies that have not been published before.\n", "  Recently it has been suggested that many-body localization (MBL) can occur in\ntranslation-invariant systems, and candidate 1D models have been proposed. We\nfind that such models, in contrast to MBL systems with quenched disorder,\ntypically exhibit much more severe finite-size effects due to the presence of\ntwo or more vastly different energy scales. In a finite system, this can easily\ncreate an artificial splitting of the density of states (DOS) into bands\nseparated by large energy gaps. We argue that in order for such models to\nfaithfully represent the physics of the thermodynamic limit, the ratio of the\nrelevant coupling parameters must be larger than a certain cutoff that depends\non system size, and should be chosen in such a way that various bands in the\nDOS of a given model overlap with one another. By setting the parameters in\nthis way to minimize the finite-size effects, we then perform exact\ndiagonalization studies of several translation-invariant MBL candidate models.\nBased on the variety of diagnostics, including entanglement properties and the\nbehaviour of local observables, we find the systems exhibit thermal (ergodic),\nrather than MBL-like behaviour. Our results suggest that MBL in\ntranslation-invariant systems with two or more very different energy scales is\nless robust than perturbative arguments suggest, possibly pointing to the\nimportance of non-perturbative effects which induce delocalization in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  Using the boundary state formalism we investigate the effect of tachyon\ncondensation process on a rotating and moving D$p$-brane with various\nbackground fields in the bosonic string theory. The rotation and motion are\ninside the brane volume. We demonstrate that some specific rotations and/or\nmotions can preserve the brane from instability and collapse.\n", "  We study the holographic dual of a (2+1)-dimensional s-wave superfluid that\nbreaks an abelian U(1) x U(1) global symmetry group to the diagonal U(1)_V. The\nmodel is inspired by Sen's tachyonic action, and the operator that condenses\ntransforms in the bifundamental representation of the symmetry group. We focus\non two configurations: the first one describes a marginal operator, and the\nphase diagram at finite temperature contains a first or a second order phase\ntransition, depending on the parameters that determine the theory. In the\nsecond model the operator is relevant and the finite temperature transitions\nare always second order. In the latter case the conductivity for the current\nassociated to the broken symmetry shows quasiparticle excitations at low\ntemperatures, with mass given by the width of the superconducting gap. The\nsuppression of spectral weight at low frequencies is also observed in the\nconductivity associated to the conserved symmetry, for which the DC value\ndecreases as the temperature is reduced.\n", "  We report on a method, PUSH, for triggering core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of massive stars in spherical symmetry. We explore basic explosion\nproperties and calibrate PUSH such that the observables of SN1987A are\nreproduced. Our simulations are based on the general relativistic hydrodynamics\ncode AGILE combined with the detailed neutrino transport scheme IDSA for\nelectron neutrinos and ALS for the muon and tau neutrinos. To trigger\nexplosions in the otherwise non-exploding simulations, we rely on the\nneutrino-driven mechanism. The PUSH method locally increases the energy\ndeposition in the gain region through energy deposition by the heavy neutrino\nflavors. Our setup allows us to model the explosion for several seconds after\ncore bounce. We explore the progenitor range 18-21M$_{\\odot}$. Our studies\nreveal a distinction between high compactness (HC) and low compactness (LC)\nprogenitor models, where LC models tend to explore earlier, with a lower\nexplosion energy, and with a lower remnant mass. HC models are needed to obtain\nexplosion energies around 1 Bethe, as observed for SN1987A. However, all the\nmodels with sufficiently high explosion energy overproduce $^{56}$Ni. We\nconclude that fallback is needed to reproduce the observed nucleosynthesis\nyields. The nucleosynthesis yields of $^{57-58}$Ni depend sensitively on the\nelectron fraction and on the location of the mass cut with respect to the\ninitial shell structure of the progenitor star. We identify a progenitor and a\nsuitable set of PUSH parameters that fit the explosion properties of SN1987A\nwhen assuming 0.1M$_{\\odot}$ of fallback. We predict a neutron star with a\ngravitational mass of 1.50M$_{\\odot}$. We find correlations between explosion\nproperties and the compactness of the progenitor model in the explored\nprogenitors. However, a more complete analysis will require the exploration of\na larger set of progenitors with PUSH.\n", "  We present 1D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) time-dependent\nradiative-transfer simulations of a Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model\nwhich synthesizes 0.51 Msun of 56Ni, and confront our results to the Type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) 2002bo over the first 100 days of its evolution. Assuming\nonly homologous expansion, this same model reproduces the bolometric and\nmulti-band light curves, the secondary near-infrared (NIR) maxima, and the\noptical and NIR spectra. The chemical stratification of our model qualitatively\nagrees with previous inferences by Stehle et al., but reveals significant\nquantitative differences for both iron-group and intermediate-mass elements. We\nshow that +/-0.1 Msun (i.e., +/-20 per cent) variations in 56Ni mass have a\nmodest impact on the bolometric and colour evolution of our model. One notable\nexception is the U-band, where a larger abundance of iron-group elements\nresults in less opaque ejecta through ionization effects, our model with more\n56Ni displaying a higher near-UV flux level. In the NIR range, such variations\nin 56Ni mass affect the timing of the secondary maxima but not their magnitude,\nin agreement with observational results. Moreover, the variation in the I, J,\nand K_s magnitudes is less than 0.1 mag within ~10 days from bolometric\nmaximum, confirming the potential of NIR photometry of SNe Ia for cosmology.\nOverall, the delayed-detonation mechanism in single Chandrasekhar-mass white\ndwarf progenitors seems well suited for SN 2002bo and similar SNe Ia displaying\na broad Si II 6355 A line. Whatever multidimensional processes are at play\nduring the explosion leading to these events, they must conspire to produce an\nejecta comparable to our spherically-symmetric model.\n", "  We compute the fully differential decay rate of the Standard Model Higgs\nboson into b-quarks at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in\nalpha_S. We employ a general subtraction scheme developed for the calculation\nof higher order perturbative corrections to QCD jet cross sections, which is\nbased on the universal infrared factorization properties of QCD squared matrix\nelements. We show that the subtractions render the various contributions to the\nNNLO correction finite. In particular, we demonstrate analytically that the sum\nof integrated subtraction terms correctly reproduces the infrared poles of the\ntwo-loop double virtual contribution to this process. We present illustrative\ndifferential distributions obtained by implementing the method in a parton\nlevel Monte Carlo program. The basic ingredients of our subtraction scheme,\nused here for the first time to compute a physical observable, are universal\nand can be employed for the computation of more involved processes.\n", "  A single-level quantum dot with Coulomb repulsion attached to two\nsuperconducting leads is studied via the perturbation expansion in the\ninteraction strength. We use the Nambu formalism and the standard many-body\ndiagrammatic representation of the impurity Green functions to formulate the\nMatsubara self-consistent perturbation expansion. We show that at zero\ntemperature second order of the expansion in its $\\it{spin-symmetric}$ version\nyields a nearly perfect agreement with the numerically exact calculations for\nthe position of the $0-\\pi$ phase boundary at which the Andreev bound states\nreach the Fermi energy as well as for the values of single-particle quantities\nin the 0-phase. We present results for phase diagrams, level occupation,\ninduced local superconducting gap, Josephson current, and energy of the Andreev\nbound states with the precision surpassing any (semi)analytical approaches\nemployed thus far.\n", "  We study the dependence of protoplanetary disk evolution on stellar mass\nusing a large sample of young stellar objects in nearby young star-forming\nregions. We update the protoplanetary disk fractions presented in our recent\nwork (paper I of this series) derived for 22 nearby (< 500 pc) associations\nbetween 1 and 100 Myr. We use a subsample of 1 428 spectroscopically confirmed\nmembers to study the impact of stellar mass on protoplanetary disk evolution.\nWe divide this sample into two stellar mass bins (2 M$_{\\odot}$ boundary) and\ntwo age bins (3 Myr boundary), and use infrared excesses over the photospheric\nemission to classify objects in three groups: protoplanetary disks, evolved\ndisks, and diskless. The homogeneous analysis and bias corrections allow for a\nstatistically significant inter-comparison of the obtained results. We find\nrobust statistical evidence of disk evolution dependence with stellar mass. Our\nresults, combined with previous studies on disk evolution, confirm that\nprotoplanetary disks evolve faster and/or earlier around high-mass (> 2\nM$_{\\odot}$) stars. We also find a roughly constant level of evolved disks\nthroughout the whole age and stellar mass spectra. We conclude that\nprotoplanetary disk evolution depends on stellar mass. Such a dependence could\nhave important implications for gas giant planet formation and migration, and\ncould contribute to explaining the apparent paucity of hot Jupiters around\nhigh-mass stars.\n", "  We calculate the cross section for the inclusive production of B mesons in pp\nand ppbar collisions at next-to-leading order in the general-mass\nvariable-flavor-number scheme and show that a suitable choice of factorization\nscales leads to a smooth transition to the fixed-flavor-number scheme. Our\nnumerical results are in good agreement with data from the Tevatron and LHC\nexperiments at small and at large transverse momenta.\n", "  We show that similarity (or equivalent) transformations enable one to\nconstruct non-Hermitian operators with real spectrum. In this way we can also\nprove and generalize the results obtained by other authors by means of a\ngauge-like transformation and its generalization. Such similarity\ntransformations also reveal the connection with pseudo-Hermiticity in a simple\nand straightforward way. In addition to it we consider the positive and\nnegative eigenvalues of a three-parameter non-Hermitian oscillator.\n", "  We propose a simple yet efficient method for generating in-plane hollow beams\nwith a nearly-full circular light shell without the contribution of backward\npropagating waves. The method relies on modulating the phase in the near field\nof a centro-symmetric optical wavefront, such as that from a\nhigh-numericalaperture focused wave field. We illustrate how beam acceleration\nmay be carried out by using an ultranarrow non-flat meta-surface formed by\nengineered plasmonic nanoslits. A mirrorsymmetric, with respect to the optical\naxis, circular caustic surface is numerically demonstrated that can be used as\nan optical bottle.\n", "  An orthonormal basis consisting of unentangled (pure tensor) elements in a\ntensor product of Hilbert spaces is an Unentangled Orthogonal Basis (UOB). In\ngeneral, for $n$ qubits, we prove that in its natural structure as a real\nvariety, the space of UOB is a bouquet of products of Riemann spheres\nparametrized by a class of edge colorings of hypercubes. Its irreducible\ncomponents of maximum dimension are products of $2^n-1$ two-spheres. Using a\ntheorem of Walgate and Hardy, we observe that the UOB whose elements are\ndistinguishable by local operations and classical communication (called locally\ndistinguishable or LOCC distinguishable UOB) are exactly those in the maximum\ndimensional components. Bennett et al, in their in-depth study of quantum\nnonlocality without entanglement, include a specific 3 qubit example UOB which\nis not LOCC distinguishable; we construct certain generalized counterparts of\nthis UOB in $n$ qubits.\n", "  We report a comprehensive micro-Raman scattering study of\nelectrochemically-gated graphene field-effect transistors. The geometrical\ncapacitance of the electrochemical top-gates is accurately determined from\ndual-gated Raman measurements, allowing a quantitative analysis of the\nfrequency, linewidth and integrated intensity of the main Raman features of\ngraphene. The anomalous behavior observed for the G-mode phonon is in very good\nagreement with theoretical predictions and provides a measurement of the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant for zone-center ($\\Gamma$ point) optical\nphonons. In addition, the decrease of the integrated intensity of the 2D-mode\nfeature with increasing doping, makes it possible to determine the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant for near zone-edge (K and K' points) optical\nphonons. We find that the electron-phonon coupling strength at $\\Gamma$ is five\ntimes weaker than at K (K'), in very good agreement with a direct measurement\nof the ratio of the integrated intensities of the resonant intra- (2D') and\ninter-valley (2D) Raman features. We also show that electrochemical reactions,\noccurring at large gate biases, can be harnessed to efficiently create defects\nin graphene, with concentrations up to approximately $1.4\\times 10^{12}~\\rm\ncm^{-2}$. At such defect concentrations, we estimate that the electron-defect\nscattering rate remains much smaller than the electron-phonon scattering rate.\nThe evolution of the G- and 2D-mode features upon doping remain unaffected by\nthe presence of defects and the doping dependence of the D mode closely follows\nthat of its two-phonon (2D mode) overtone. Finally, the linewidth and frequency\nof the G-mode phonon as well as the frequencies of the G- and 2D-mode phonons\nin doped graphene follow sample-independent correlations that can be utilized\nfor accurate estimations of the charge carrier density.\n", "  Starting from the Oliva--Tempo--Troncoso black hole, a solution of the\nBergshoeff--Hohm--Townsend massive gravity, a class of the Vaidya-like exact\nvacuum solutions with torsion is constructed in the three-dimensional\nPoincar\\'e gauge theory. A particular subclass of these solutions is shown to\npossess the asymptotic conformal symmetry. The related canonical energy\ncontains a contribution stemming from torsion.\n", "  Over the recent decades, diverse formalisms have emerged that are adopted to\napproach complex systems. Amongst those, we may quote the q-calculus in\nTsallis' version of Non-Extensive Statistics with its undeniable success\nwhenever applied to a wide class of different systems; Kaniadakis' approach,\nbased on the compatibility between relativity and thermodynamics; Fractional\nCalculus (FC), that deals with the dynamics of anomalous transport and other\nnatural phenomena, and also some local versions of FC that claim to be able to\nstudy fractal and multifractal spaces and to describe dynamics in these spaces\nby means of fractional differential equations.\n  The question we might ask is whether or not there are common aspects that\nconnect these alternative approaches. In this short communication, we discuss a\npossible relationship between q-deformed algebras in two different contexts of\nStatistical Mechanics, namely, the Tsallis' framework and the Kaniadakis'\nscenario, with local form of fractional-derivative operators defined in fractal\nmedia, the so-called Hausdorff derivatives, mapped into a continuous medium\nwith a fractal measure. This connection opens up new perspectives for theories\nthat satisfactorily describe the dynamics for the transport in media with\nfractal metrics, such as porous or granular media. Possible connections with\nother alternative definitions of FC are also contempled. Insights on complexity\nconnected to concepts like coarse-grained space-time and physics in general are\npointed out.\n", "  Conservation laws in the $1f_{7/2}$ shell model of $^{48}$Cr found in numeric\nstudies by Escuderos, Zamick and Bayman [A. Escuderos, L. Zamick, and B. F.\nBayman, arXiv:0506050 (2005)] and me [K. Neerg\\aa rd, Phys. Rev. C \\textbf{90},\n014318 (2014)] are explained by symmetry under particle-hole conjugation and\nthe structure of the irreps of the symplectic group Sp(4). A generalization is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this chapter we review the use of semiconductor quantum dots as sources of\nquantum light. Principally, we focus on resonant two-photon excitation, which\nis a method that allows for on-demand generation of photon pairs. We explore\nthe advantages of resonant excitation and present a number of measurements that\nwere made in this excitation regime. In particular, we cover the following\ntopics: photon statistics, coherent manipulation of the ground-excited state\nsuperposition, and generation of time-bin entangled photon pairs.\n", "  The Typical Medium Theory provides conceptually the simplest order parameter\ndescription of Anderson localization by self-consistently calculating the\ngeometrically-averaged (typical) local density of states (LDOS). Here we show\nhow spatial correlations can also be captured within such a self-consistent\ntheory, by utilizing the standard Landau method of allowing for (slow) spatial\nfluctuations of the order parameter, and performing an appropriate gradient\nexpansion. Our theoretical results provide insight into recent STM experiments,\nwhich were used to visualize the spatially fluctuating electronic wave\nfunctions near the metal insulator transition in $Ga_{1-x}Mn_{x}As.$ We show\nthat, within our theory, all features of the experiment can be accounted for by\nconsidering a model of disorder renormalized by long-range Coulomb\ninteractions. This includes the pseudogap formation, the $C(R)\\sim\\frac{1}{R}$\nform of the LDOS autocorrelations function, and the $\\zeta\\sim\\frac{1}{E}$\nenergy dependence of the correlation length at criticality.\n", "  In this paper searches for flaring astrophysical neutrino sources and sources\nwith periodic emission with the IceCube neutrino telescope are presented. In\ncontrast to time integrated searches, where steady emission is assumed, the\nanalyses presented here look for a time dependent signal of neutrinos using the\ninformation from the neutrino arrival times to enhance the discovery potential.\nA search was performed for correlations between neutrino arrival times and\ndirections as well as neutrino emission following time dependent lightcurves,\nsporadic emission or periodicities of candidate sources. These include active\ngalactic nuclei, soft $\\gamma$-ray repeaters, supernova remnants hosting\npulsars, micro-quasars and X-ray binaries. The work presented here updates and\nextends previously published results to a longer period that covers four years\nof data from 2008 April 5 to 2012 May 16 including the first year of operation\nof the completed 86-string detector. The analyses did not find any significant\ntime dependent point sources of neutrinos and the results were used to set\nupper limits on the neutrino flux from source candidates.\n", "  The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) searches for $a\\to\\gamma$ conversion in\nthe 9 T magnetic field of a refurbished LHC test magnet that can be directed\ntoward the Sun. Two parallel magnet bores can be filled with helium of\nadjustable pressure to match the X-ray refractive mass $m_\\gamma$ to the axion\nsearch mass $m_a$. After the vacuum phase (2003--2004), which is optimal for\n$m_a\\lesssim0.02$ eV, we used $^4$He in 2005--2007 to cover the mass range of\n0.02--0.39 eV and $^3$He in 2009--2011 to scan from 0.39--1.17 eV. After\nimproving the detectors and shielding, we returned to $^4$He in 2012 to\ninvestigate a narrow $m_a$ range around 0.2 eV (\"candidate setting\" of our\nearlier search) and 0.39--0.42 eV, the upper axion mass range reachable with\n$^4$He, to \"cross the axion line\" for the KSVZ model. We have improved the\nlimit on the axion-photon coupling to $g_{a\\gamma}< 1.47\\times10^{-10} {\\rm\n  GeV}^{-1}$ (95% C.L.), depending on the pressure settings. Since 2013, we\nhave returned to vacuum and aim for a significant increase in sensitivity.\n", "  We present high-resolution far-UV spectroscopy of the 14 galaxies of the\nLyman Alpha Reference Sample; a sample of strongly star-forming galaxies at low\nredshifts ($0.028 < z < 0.18$). We compare the derived properties to global\nproperties derived from multi band imaging and 21 cm HI interferometry and\nsingle dish observations, as well as archival optical SDSS spectra. Besides the\nLyman $\\alpha$ line, the spectra contain a number of metal absorption features\nallowing us to probe the kinematics of the neutral ISM and evaluate the optical\ndepth and and covering fraction of the neutral medium as a function of\nline-of-sight velocity. Furthermore, we show how this, in combination with\nprecise determination of systemic velocity and good Ly$\\alpha$ spectra, can be\nused to distinguish a model in which separate clumps together fully cover the\nbackground source, from the \"picket fence\" model named by Heckman et al.\n(2011). We find that no one single effect dominates in governing Ly$\\alpha$\nradiative transfer and escape. Ly$\\alpha$ escape in our sample coincides with a\nmaximum velocity-binned covering fraction of $\\lesssim 0.9$ and bulk outflow\nvelocities of $\\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, although a number of galaxies show\nthese characteristics and yet little or no Ly$\\alpha$ escape. We find that\nLy$\\alpha$ peak velocities, where available, are not consistent with a strong\nbackscattered component, but rather with a simpler model of an intrinsic\nemission line overlaid by a blueshifted absorption profile from the outflowing\nwind. Finally, we find a strong anticorrelation between H$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidth and maximum velocity-binned covering factor, and propose a heuristic\nexplanatory model.\n", "  Detection of the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization (EoR) is\nchallenging especially because, even after removing the foregrounds, the\nresidual Stokes $I$ maps contain leakage from polarized emission that can mimic\nthe signal. Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present\nrealistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR\nobservations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the\nlevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and\ncompared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization\nleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\\perp$ when 70\\% of the leakage had\nbeen removed. These LOFAR results show that even a modest polarimetric\ncalibration over a field of view of $\\lesssim 4^\\circ$ in the future arrays\nlike SKA will ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the\nexpected EoR signal at the scales of 0.02-1 Mpc$^{-1}$.\n", "  We present near-infrared (NIR) time-series spectroscopy, as well as\ncomplementary ultraviolet (UV), optical, and NIR data, of the Type Ia supernova\n(SN Ia) iPTF13ebh, which was discovered within two days from the estimated time\nof explosion. The first NIR spectrum was taken merely 2.3 days after explosion\nand may be the earliest NIR spectrum yet obtained of a SN Ia. The most striking\nfeatures in the spectrum are several NIR C I lines, and the C I {\\lambda}1.0693\n{\\mu}m line is the strongest ever observed in a SN Ia. Interestingly, no strong\noptical C II counterparts were found, even though the optical spectroscopic\ntime series began early and is densely-cadenced. Except at the very early\nepochs, within a few days from the time of explosion, we show that the strong\nNIR C I compared to the weaker optical C II appears to be general in SNe Ia.\niPTF13ebh is a fast decliner with {\\Delta}m15(B) = 1.79 $\\pm$ 0.01, and its\nabsolute magnitude obeys the linear part of the width-luminosity relation. It\nis therefore categorized as a \"transitional\" event, on the fast-declining end\nof normal SNe Ia as opposed to subluminous/91bg-like objects. iPTF13ebh shows\nNIR spectroscopic properties that are distinct from both the normal and\nsubluminous/91bg-like classes, bridging the observed characteristics of the two\nclasses. These NIR observations suggest composition and density of the inner\ncore similar to that of 91bg-like events, and a deep reaching carbon burning\nlayer not observed in slower declining SNe Ia. There is also a substantial\ndifference between the explosion times inferred from the early-time light curve\nand the velocity evolution of the Si II {\\lambda}0.6355 {\\mu}m line, implying a\nlong dark phase of ~ 4 days.\n", "  Do the laws of quantum physics still hold for macroscopic objects - this is\nat the heart of Schr\\\"odinger's cat paradox - or do gravitation or yet unknown\neffects set a limit for massive particles? What is the fundamental relation\nbetween quantum physics and gravity? Ground-based experiments addressing these\nquestions may soon face limitations due to limited free-fall times and the\nquality of vacuum and microgravity. The proposed mission MAQRO may overcome\nthese limitations and allow addressing those fundamental questions. MAQRO\nharnesses recent developments in quantum optomechanics, high-mass matter-wave\ninterferometry as well as state-of-the-art space technology to push macroscopic\nquantum experiments towards their ultimate performance limits and to open new\nhorizons for applying quantum technology in space. The main scientific goal of\nMAQRO is to probe the vastly unexplored \"quantum-classical\" transition for\nincreasingly massive objects, testing the predictions of quantum theory for\ntruly macroscopic objects in a size and mass regime unachievable in\nground-based experiments. The hardware for the mission will largely be based on\navailable space technology. Here, we present the MAQRO proposal submitted in\nresponse to the (M4) Cosmic Vision call of the European Space Agency for a\nmedium-size mission opportunity with a possible launch in 2025.\n", "  Re-observations with the H.E.S.S. telescope array of the very-high-energy\n(VHE) source HESS J1018-589 A coincident with the Fermi-LAT $\\gamma$-ray binary\n1FGL J1018.6-5856 have resulted in a source detection significance of more than\n9$\\sigma$, and the detection of variability ($\\chi^2$/$\\nu$ of 238.3/155) in\nthe emitted $\\gamma$-ray flux. This variability confirms the association of\nHESS J1018-589 A with the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray binary detected by\nFermi-LAT, and also confirms the point-like source as a new very-high-energy\nbinary system. The spectrum of HESS J1018-589 A is best fit with a power-law\nfunction with photon index $\\Gamma = 2.20 \\pm 0.14_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.2_{\\rm\nsys}$. Emission is detected up to ~20 TeV. The mean differential flux level is\n$(2.9 \\pm 0.4)\\times10^{-13}$ TeV$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1 TeV,\nequivalent to ~1% of the flux from the Crab Nebula at the same energy.\nVariability is clearly detected in the night-by-night lightcurve. When folded\non the orbital period of 16.58 days, the rebinned lightcurve peaks in phase\nwith the observed X-ray and high-energy phaseograms. The fit of the H.E.S.S.\nphaseogram to a constant flux provides evidence of periodicity at the level of\n3$\\sigma$. The shape of the VHE phaseogram and measured spectrum suggest a low\ninclination, low eccentricity system with a modest impact from VHE $\\gamma$-ray\nabsorption due to pair production ($\\tau$ < 1 at 300 GeV).\n", "  Background: Shape coexistence in heavy nuclei poses a strong challenge to\nstate-of-the-art nuclear models, where several competing shape minima are found\nclose to the ground state. A classic region for investigating this phenomenon\nis in the region around $Z=82$ and the neutron mid-shell at $N=104$.\n  Purpose: Evidence for shape coexistence has been inferred from $\\alpha$-decay\nmeasurements, laser spectroscopy and in-beam measurements. While the latter\nallow the pattern of excited states and rotational band structures to be mapped\nout, a detailed understanding of shape coexistence can only come from\nmeasurements of electromagnetic matrix elements.\n  Method: Secondary, radioactive ion beams of $^{202}$Rn and $^{204}$Rn were\nstudied by means of low-energy Coulomb excitation at the REX-ISOLDE facility in\nCERN.\n  Results: The electric-quadrupole ($E2$) matrix element connecting the ground\nstate and first-excited $2^{+}_{1}$ state was extracted for both $^{202}$Rn and\n$^{204}$Rn, corresponding to ${B(E2;2^{+}_{1} \\to 2^{+}_{1})=29^{+8}_{-8}}$\nW.u. and $43^{+17}_{-12}$ W.u., respectively. Additionally, $E2$ matrix\nelements connecting the $2^{+}_{1}$ state with the $4^{+}_{1}$ and $2^{+}_{2}$\nstates were determined in $^{202}$Rn. No excited $0^{+}$ states were observed\nin the current data set, possibly due to a limited population of second-order\nprocesses at the currently-available beam energies.\n  Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of collectivity and the\ndeformation of both nuclei studied is deduced to be weak, as expected from the\nlow-lying level-energy schemes. Comparisons are also made to state-of-the-art\nbeyond-mean-field model calculations and the magnitude of the transitional\nquadrupole moments are well reproduced.\n", "  In this work we use gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow spectra observed with the\nVLT/X-shooter spectrograph to measure rest-frame extinction in GRB\nlines-of-sight by modeling the broadband near-infrared (NIR) to X-ray afterglow\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our sample consists of nine Swift GRBs,\neight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-duration\nclass. Dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the Milky Way and\nthe two Magellanic Clouds. We derive the rest-frame extinction of the entire\nsample, which fall in the range $0 \\lesssim {\\it A}_{\\rm V} \\lesssim 1.2$.\nMoreover, the SMC extinction curve is the preferred extinction curve template\nfor the majority of our sample, a result which is in agreement with those\ncommonly observed in GRB lines-of-sights. In one analysed case (GRB 120119A),\nthe common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observed\nextinction. To illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality X-shooter\nafterglow SEDs over the photometric SEDs, we repeat the modeling using the\nbroadband SEDs with the NIR-to-UV photometric measurements instead of the\nspectra. The main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to a\ncombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the SED,\nare more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore the\ndust properties in GRB hosts with respect to photometric measurements. In all\ncases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over the\nothers. We show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectral\nslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric SED analysis, can differ\nsignificantly for individual events. Finally we stress that, regardless of the\nresolution of the optical-to-NIR data, the SED modeling gives reliable results\nonly when the fit is performed on a SED covering a broader spectral region.\n", "  Coherent scattering of an electron beam by the Kapitza-Dirac effect from a\nstanding laser wave which comprises two frequency components is studied. To\nthis end, the Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved numerically with a suitable\nponderomotive potential. Besides, an analytical solution for electron\ndiffraction in the asymptotic domain of large field amplitudes is obtained and\na mathematical model in reduced dimensionality for the scattering amplitude in\nthe Bragg regime is presented. We demonstrate distinct interference signatures\nand relative phase effects when the standing wave contains a fundamental\nfrequency and its second harmonic. The influence of the relative field\nintensities on the Rabi oscillation dynamics is also discussed.\n", "  We add a Heisenberg interaction term $\\propto\\lambda$ in the one-dimensional\nSU(2)$\\otimes$XY spin-orbital model introduced by B. Kumar. At $\\lambda=0$ the\nspin and orbital degrees of freedom can be separated by a unitary\ntransformation leading to an exact solution of the model. We show that a finite\n$\\lambda>0$ leads to spontaneous dimerization of the system which in the\nthermodynamic limit becomes a smooth phase transition at $\\lambda\\to 0$,\nwhereas it remains discontinuous within the first order perturbation approach.\nWe present the behavior of the entanglement entropy, energy gap and\ndimerization order parameter in the limit of $\\lambda\\to 0$ confirming the\ncritical behavior. Finally, we show the evidence of another phase transition in\nthe Heisenberg limit, $\\lambda\\to\\infty$, and give a qualitative analytical\nexplanation of the observed dimerized states both in the limit of small and\nlarge $\\lambda$.\n", "  We consider the class of non-Hermitian operators represented by infinite\ntridiagonal matrices, selfadjoint in an indefinite inner product space with one\nnegative square. We approximate them with their finite truncations. Both\ninfinite and truncated matrices have eigenvalues of nonpositive type: either a\nsingle one on the real axis or a couple of complex conjugate ones. As a tool to\nevaluate the reliability of the use of truncations in numerical simulations, we\ngive bounds for the rate of convergence of their eigenvalues of nonpositive\ntype. Numerical examples illustrate our results.\n", "  The existence of substellar cold H2 globules in planetary nebulae and the\nmere existence of comets suggest that the physics of cold interstellar gas\nmight be much richer than usually envisioned.\n  We study the case of a cold gaseous medium in ISM conditions which is subject\nto a gas-liquid/solid phase transition.\n  First the equilibrium of general non-ideal fluids is studied using the virial\ntheorem and linear stability analysis. Then the non-linear dynamics is studied\nby using simulations to characterize the expected formation of solid bodies\nanalogous to comets. The simulations are run with a state of the art molecular\ndynamics code (LAMMPS). The long-range gravitational forces can be taken into\naccount with short-range molecular forces with finite limited computational\nresources by using super-molecules, provided the right scaling is followed.\n  The concept of super-molecule is tested with simulations, allowing us to\ncorrectly satisfy the Jeans instability criterion for one-phase fluids. The\nsimulations show that fluids presenting a phase transition are gravitationally\nunstable as well, independent of the strength of the gravitational potential,\nproducing two distinct kinds of sub-stellar bodies, those dominated by gravity\n(\"planetoids\") and those dominated by molecular attractive force (\"comets\").\n  Observations, formal analysis and computer simulations suggest the\npossibility of the formation of substellar H2 clumps in cold molecular clouds\ndue to the combination of phase transition and gravity. Fluids presenting a\nphase transition are gravitationally unstable, independent of the strength of\nthe gravitational potential. Arbitrarily small H2 clumps may form even at\nrelatively high temperatures up to 400 - 600K, according to virial analysis.\nThe combination of phase transition and gravity may be relevant for a wider\nrange of astrophysical situations, such as proto-planetary disks.\n", "  We have carried-out 98-level configuration-interaction / close-coupling\n(CI/CC) intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT) and Breit-Pauli\nR-matrix calculations for the electron-impact excitation of Be-like Al$^{9+}$.\nThe close agreement that we find between the two sets of effective collision\nstrengths demonstrates the continued robustness of the ICFT method. On the\nother hand, a comparison of this data with previous 238-level CI/CC ICFT\neffective collision strengths shows that the results for excitation up to n=4\nlevels are systematically and increasingly underestimated over a wide range of\ntemperatures by R-matrix calculations whose close-coupling expansion extends\nonly to n=4 (98-levels). Thus, we find to be false a recent conjecture that the\nICFT approach may not be completely robust. The conjecture was based upon a\ncomparison of 98-level CI/CC Dirac R-matrix effective collision strengths for\nAl$^{9+}$ with those from the 238-level CI/CC ICFT R-matrix calculations. The\ndisagreement found recently is due to a lack of convergence of the\nclose-coupling expansion in the 98-level CI/CC Dirac work. The earlier\n238-level CI/CC ICFT work has a superior target to the 98-level CI/CC Dirac one\nand provides more accurate atomic data. Similar considerations need to be made\nfor other Be-like ions and for other sequences.\n", "  We report a measurement of the branching fraction of B^+ -> tau^+ nu_tau\ndecays using a data sample of 772 x 10^6 BBbar pairs, collected at the Y(4S)\nresonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^-\ncollider. We reconstruct the accompanying B meson in a semileptonic decay and\ndetect the recoiling B candidate in the decay channel B^+ -> tau^+ nu_tau. We\nobtain a branching fraction of BR(B^+ -> tau^+ nu_tau) = [1.25 +- 0.28 (stat.)\n+- 0.27 (syst.)] x 10^-4. This result is in good agreement with previous\nmeasurements and the expectation from the calculation based on the Standard\nModel.\n", "  We fabricated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) direct current (dc) nano\nsuperconducting quantum interference devices (nanoSQUIDs) based on grain\nboundary Josephson junctions by focused ion beam patterning. Characterization\nof electric transport and noise properties at 4.2$\\,$K in magnetically shielded\nenvironment yields a very small inductance $L$ of a few pH for an optimized\ndevice geometry. This in turn results in very low values of flux noise\n$<50\\,{\\rm n}\\Phi_0/{\\rm Hz}^{1/2}$ in the thermal white noise limit, which\nyields spin sensitivities of a few $\\mu_{\\rm B}/{\\rm Hz}^{1/2}$ ($\\Phi_0$ is\nthe magnetic flux quantum and $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ is the Bohr magneton). We observe\nfrequency-dependent excess noise up to 7$\\,$MHz, which can only partially be\neliminated by bias reversal readout. This indicates the presence of fluctuators\nof unknown origin, possibly related to defect-induced spins in the SrTiO$_3$\nsubstrate. We demonstrate the potential of using YBCO nanoSQUIDs for the\ninvestigation of small spin systems, by placing a 39$\\,$nm diameter Fe\nnanowire, encapsulated in a carbon nanotube, on top of a non-optimized YBCO\nnanoSQUID and by measuring the magnetization reversal of the Fe nanowire via\nthe change of magnetic flux coupled to the nanoSQUID. The measured flux signals\nupon magnetization reversal of the Fe nanowire are in very good agreement with\nestimated values, and the determined switching fields indicate magnetization\nreversal of the nanowire via curling mode.\n", "  We show Akari data, Herschel data and data from the SCUBA2 camera on JCMT, of\nmolecular clouds. We focus on pre-stellar cores within the clouds. We present\nAkari data of the L1147-1157 ring in Cepheus and show how the data indicate\nthat the cores are being externally heated. We present SCUBA2 and Herschel data\nof the Ophiuchus region and show how the environment is also affecting core\nevolution in this region. We discuss the effects of the magnetic field in the\nLupus I region, and how this lends support to a model for the formation and\nevolution of cores in filamentary molecular clouds.\n", "  We consider heat transport in one-dimensional harmonic chains with isotopic\ndisorder, focussing our attention mainly on how disorder correlations affect\nheat conduction. Our approach reveals that long-range correlations can change\nthe number of low-frequency extended states. As a result, with a proper choice\nof correlations one can control how the conductivity $\\kappa$ scales with the\nchain length $N$. We present a detailed analysis of the role of specific\nlong-range correlations for which a size-independent conductivity is exactly\nrecovered in the case of fixed boundary conditions. As for free boundary\nconditions, we show that disorder correlations can lead to a conductivity\nscaling as $\\kappa \\sim N^{\\varepsilon}$, with the scaling exponent\n$\\varepsilon$ being arbitrarily small (although not strictly zero), so that\nnormal conduction is almost recovered even in this case.\n", "  The relevance of neglecting three- and four-body interactions in the\ncoarse-grained version of the Asakura-Oosawa model is examined. A mapping\nbetween the first few virial coefficients of the binary nonadditive hard-sphere\nmixture representative of this model and those arising from the coarse-grained\n(pairwise) depletion potential approximation allows for a quantitative\nevaluation of the effect of such interactions. This turns out to be especially\nimportant for large size ratios and large reservoir polymer packing fractions.\n", "  The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is widely used to sample a probability\ndensity function (pdf) generated by a stochastic model conditioned by noisy\ndata. This pdf can be either a joint posterior that describes the evolution of\nthe state of the system in time, conditioned on all the data up to the present,\nor a particular marginal of this posterior. We show that the EnKF collapses in\nthe same way and under even broader conditions as a particle filter when it\nsamples the joint posterior. However, this does not imply that EnKF collapses\nwhen it samples the marginal posterior. We we show that a localized and\ninflated EnKF can efficiently sample this marginal, and argue that the marginal\nposterior is often the more useful pdf in geophysics. This explains the wide\napplicability of EnKF in this field. We further investigate the typical tuning\nof EnKF, in which one attempts to match the mean square error (MSE) to the\nmarginal posterior variance, and show that sampling error may be huge, even if\nthe MSE is moderate.\n", "  Fractional (L\\'{e}vy-type) operators are known to be spatially nonlocal. This\nbecomes an issue if confronted with a priori imposed exterior Dirichlet\nboundary data. We address spectral properties of the prototype example of the\nCauchy operator $(-\\Delta )^{1/2}$ in the interval $D=(-1,1) \\subset R$, with a\nfocus on functional shapes of lowest eigenfunctions and their fall-off at the\nboundaries of $D$. New high accuracy formulas are deduced for approximate\neigenfunctions. We analyze how their shape reproduction fidelity is correlated\nwith the evaluation finesse of the corresponding eigenvalues.\n", "  The Internet is composed of routing devices connected between them and\norganized into independent administrative entities: the Autonomous Systems. The\nexistence of different types of Autonomous Systems (like large connectivity\nproviders, Internet Service Providers or universities) together with\ngeographical and economical constraints, turns the Internet into a complex\nmodular and hierarchical network. This organization is reflected in many\nproperties of the Internet topology, like its high degree of clustering and its\nrobustness.\n  In this work, we study the modular structure of the Internet router-level\ngraph in order to assess to what extent the Autonomous Systems satisfy some of\nthe known notions of community structure. We show that the modular structure of\nthe Internet is much richer than what can be captured by the current community\ndetection methods, which are severely affected by resolution limits and by the\nheterogeneity of the Autonomous Systems. Here we overcome this issue by using a\nmultiresolution detection algorithm combined with a small sample of nodes. We\nalso discuss recent work on community structure in the light of our results.\n", "  In order to assess whether the environment has a significant effect on galaxy\nsizes, we compare the mass--size relations of cluster and field galaxies in the\n$0.4 < z < 0.8$ redshift range from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS)\nusing HST images. We analyse two mass-selected samples, one defined using\nphotometric redshifts ($10.2 \\le \\log M_\\ast/M_{\\odot} \\le 12.0$), and a\nsmaller more robust subsample using spectroscopic redshifts ($10.6 \\le \\log\nM_\\ast/M_{\\odot} \\le 11.8$). We find no significant difference in the size\ndistributions of cluster and field galaxies of a given morphology. Similarly,\nwe find no significant difference in the size distributions of cluster and\nfield galaxies of similar rest-frame $B-V$ colours. We rule out average size\ndifferences larger than $10$--$20$\\% in both cases. Consistent conclusions are\nfound with the spectroscopic and photometric samples. These results have\nimportant consequences for the physical process(es) responsible for the size\nevolution of galaxies, and in particular the effect of the environment. The\nremarkable growth in galaxy size observed from $z\\sim2.5$ has been reported to\ndepend on the environment at higher redshifts ($z>1$), with early-type/passive\ngalaxies in higher density environments growing earlier. Such dependence\ndisappears at lower redshifts. Therefore, if the reported difference at\nhigher-$z$ is real, the growth of field galaxies has caught up with that of\ncluster galaxies by $z\\sim1$. Any putative mechanism responsible for galaxy\ngrowth has to account for the existence of environmental differences at high\nredshift and their absence (or weakening) at lower redshifts.\n", "  We present a detailed statistical treatment of the energy calibration of\nhybrid air-shower detectors, which combine a surface detector array and a\nfluorescence detector, to obtain an unbiased estimate of the calibration curve.\nThe special features of calibration data from air showers prevent unbiased\nresults, if a standard least-squares fit is applied to the problem. We develop\na general maximum-likelihood approach, based on the detailed statistical model,\nto solve the problem. Our approach was developed for the Pierre Auger\nObservatory, but the applied principles are general and can be transferred to\nother air-shower experiments, even to the cross-calibration of other\nobservables. Since our general likelihood function is expensive to compute, we\nderive two approximations with significantly smaller computational cost. In the\nrecent years both have been used to calibrate data of the Pierre Auger\nObservatory. We demonstrate that these approximations introduce negligible bias\nwhen they are applied to simulated toy experiments, which mimic realistic\nexperimental conditions.\n", "  Integrated photonic devices are poised to play a key role in a wide variety\nof applications, ranging from optical interconnects and sensors to quantum\ncomputing. However, only a small library of semi-analytically designed devices\nare currently known. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design\nmethod that explores the full design space of fabricable devices and allows us\nto design devices with previously unattainable functionality, higher\nperformance and robustness, and smaller footprints compared to conventional\ndevices. We designed a silicon wavelength demultiplexer that splits\n$1300~\\mathrm{nm}$ and $1550~\\mathrm{nm}$ light from an input waveguide into\ntwo output waveguides, and fabricated and characterized several devices. The\ndevices display low insertion loss $\\left(2 - 4~\\mathrm{dB}\\right)$, high\ncontrast $\\left(12 - 17~\\mathrm{dB}\\right)$, and wide bandwidths $\\left(\\sim\n100~\\mathrm{nm} \\right)$. The device footprint is $2.8 \\times 2.8 ~\\mathrm{\\mu\nm}$, making this the smallest dielectric wavelength splitter to date.\n", "  We present the first detection of a rotationally affected series consisting\nof 36 consecutive high-order sectoral dipole gravity modes in a slowly\npulsating B (SPB) star. The results are based on the analysis of four years of\nvirtually uninterrupted photometric data assembled with the Kepler Mission, and\nhigh-resolution spectra acquired using the HERMES spectrograph at the 1.2 meter\nMercator Telescope. The spectroscopic measurements place KIC7760680 inside the\nSPB instability strip, near the cool edge. The photometric analysis reveals the\nlongest unambiguous series of gravity modes of the same degree l with\nconsecutive radial order n, that carries clear signatures of chemical mixing\nand rotation. With such exceptional observational constraints, this star should\nbe considered as the Rosetta Stone of SPBs for future modelling, and bring us a\nstep closer to the much needed seismic calibration of stellar structure models\nof massive stars.\n", "  The effect of a tunable, externally coupled Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity to\nresonantly enhance the optical Hall effect signatures at terahertz frequencies\nproduced by a traditional Drude-like two-dimensional electron gas is shown and\ndiscussed in this communication. As a result, the detection of optical Hall\neffect signatures at conveniently obtainable magnetic fields, for example by\nneodymium permanent magnets, is demonstrated. An AlInN/GaN-based high electron\nmobility transistor structure grown on a sapphire substrate is used for the\nexperiment. The optical Hall effect signatures and their dispersions, which are\ngoverned by the frequency and the reflectance minima and maxima of the\nexternally coupled Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity, are presented and discussed. Tuning\nthe externally coupled Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity strongly modifies the optical\nHall effect signatures, which provides a new degree of freedom for optical Hall\neffect experiments in addition to frequency, angle of incidence and magnetic\nfield direction and strength.\n", "  We exploit spin noise spectroscopy (SNS) to directly observe build-up of\ndynamic nuclear polarization and relaxation of a perturbed nuclear spin-system\nto its equilibrium state in a single-shot experiment. The SNS experiments were\nperformed on a layer of bulk $n$-type GaAs embedded into a high-finesse\nmicrocavity with negative detuning. The dynamic nuclear spin polarization is\nobserved as a shift of the peak in the electron spin noise spectrum due to the\nbuild-up of the Overhauser field acting on the electron spin. The relaxation\ndynamics of nuclear spin system was revealed in the time-resolved SNS\nexperiments where the exponential decay of the Overhauser field with\ncharacteristic timescale of hundreds of seconds was detected. We show that\nelliptically polarized laser beam tuned in resonance with the cavity mode,\nwhose energy corresponds to nominal transparency of the semiconductor, can\nnevertheless produce a sizable nuclear polarization.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on pure liquid water,\naqueous solutions of sodium chloride, and polymer solutions exposed to a strong\nexternal electric field with the goal to gain molecular insight into the\nstructural response to the field. Several simulation methodologies have been\nused to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the processes leading to the\nformation of liquid bridges and jets (in the production of nanofibers). It is\nshown that in the established nanoscale structures, the molecules form a chain\nwith their dipole moments oriented parallel to the applied field throughout the\nentire sample volume. The presence of ions may disturb this structure leading\nto its ultimate disintegration into droplets; the concentration dependence of\nthe threshold field required to stabilize a liquid column has been determined.\nConformational changes of the polymer in the jetting process have also been\nobserved.\n", "  We used the Very Large Array to carry out a multi-epoch radio continuum\nmonitoring of the Orion Nebula Cluster and Orion Molecular Cloud. Our\nobservations reveal the presence of 19 sources. With the exception of the\nsources BN and C the sources show variability between the different epochs. We\nhave found tentative evidence of variability in the massive object related with\nsource I. Our observations also confirm radio flux density variations of a\nfactor >2 on timescales of hours to days in 5 sources. One of these flaring\nsources, OHC-E, has been detected for the first time. We conclude that the\nradio emission arises from: i) highly-variable non-thermal gyrosynchrotron\nemission produced by electrons accelerated in the magnetospheres of pre-main\nsequence stars; ii) thermal emission from ionized gas and/or heated dust around\nmassive objects and proplyds. Combining our sample with other radio monitoring\nand a X-ray catalog, we have studied the properties of 51 radio/X-ray stars. We\nhave found severals hints of a direct relation between the X-ray activity and\nthe mechanisms responsible for (at least some fraction of) the radio emission.\nWe have estimated a radio flaring rate of 0.14 flares day-1 in the densest\nstellar cluster of the region, suggesting that radio flares from young stars\nare more common events than previously thought.\n", "  We have investigated temperature trends of the microscopic structure of the\nSPC/E and TIP4P-Ew water models in terms of the pair distribution functions,\ncoordination numbers, the average number of hydrogen bonds, the distribution of\nbonding states of a single molecule as well as the angular distribution of\nmolecules by using the constant pressure molecular dynamics simulations. The\nevolution of the structure is put in correspondence with the dependence of\nwater density on high temperatures down to the region of temperatures where the\nsystem becomes supercooled. It is shown that the fraction of molecules with\nthree and four bonds determine the maximum density for both models. Moreover,\nthe temperature dependence of the dielectric constant is obtained and analyzed.\n", "  Quasiprobability distributions (QDs) in open quantum systems are investigated\nfor $SU(2)$, spin like systems, having relevance to quantum optics and\ninformation. In this work, effect of both quantum non-demolition (QND) and\ndissipative open quantum systems, on the evolution of a number of spin QDs are\ninvestigated. Specifically, compact analytic expressions for the $W$, $P$, $Q$,\nand $F$ functions are obtained for some interesting single, two and three qubit\nstates, undergoing general open system evolutions. Further, corresponding QDs\nare reported for an N qubit Dicke model and a spin-1 system. The existence of\nnonclassical characteristics are observed in all the systems investigated here.\nThe study leads to a clear understanding of quantum to classical transition in\na host of realistic physical scenarios. Variation of the amount of\nnonclassicality observed in the quantum systems, studied here,are also\ninvestigated using nonclassical volume.\n", "  We present the complete calculation of $W$-boson production in association\nwith a jet in hadronic collisions through next-to-next-to-leading order in\nperturbative QCD. To cancel infrared divergences we introduce a new subtraction\nmethod that exploits the fact that the $N$-jettiness event-shape variable fully\ncaptures the singularity structure of QCD amplitudes with final-state partons.\nThis method holds for processes with an arbitrary number of jets, and is easily\nimplemented into existing frameworks for higher-order calculations. We present\ninitial phenomenological results for $W$+jet production at the LHC. The NNLO\ncorrections are small and lead to a significantly reduced theoretical error,\nopening the door to precision measurements in the $W$+jet channel at the LHC.\n", "  We show numerically that a rotating, harmonically trapped mixture of two\nBose-Einstein-condensed superfluids can, contrary to its single-species\ncounterpart, contain a multiply quantized vortex in the ground state of the\nsystem. This giant vortex can occur without any accompanying single-quantum\nvortices, may either be coreless or have an empty core, and can be realized in\na $^{87}$Rb-$^{41}$K Bose-Einstein condensate. Our results not only provide a\nrare example of a stable, solitary multiquantum vortex but also reveal exotic\nphysics stemming from the coexistence of multiple, compositionally distinct\ncondensates in one system.\n", "  The slow-roll field equations for the case of non-minimally coupled scalar\nfields are obtained in two ways: first using the direct generalization of\nslow-roll conditions in the minimal coupling case to non-minimal one; and,\nsecond, conformal transforming the slow-roll field equations in the Einstein\nframe to the Jordan frame and then applying the generalized slow-roll\nconditions. We compare the difference of two methods in calculation of the\nspectral index, $n_s$, for a model example. The second method seems to be more\nprecise.\n", "  We present a strong and weak lensing reconstruction of the massive cluster\nAbell 2744, the first cluster for which deep Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) images\nand spectroscopy from the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS) are\navailable. By performing a targeted search for emission lines in multiply\nimaged sources using the GLASS spectra, we obtain 5 high-confidence\nspectroscopic redshifts and 2 tentative ones. We confirm 1 strongly lensed\nsystem by detecting the same emission lines in all 3 multiple images. We also\nsearch for additional line emitters blindly and use the full GLASS\nspectroscopic catalog to test reliability of photometric redshifts for faint\nline emitters. We see a reasonable agreement between our photometric and\nspectroscopic redshift measurements, when including nebular emission in\nphotometric redshift estimations. We introduce a stringent procedure to\nidentify only secure multiple image sets based on colors, morphology, and\nspectroscopy. By combining 7 multiple image systems with secure spectroscopic\nredshifts (at 5 distinct redshift planes) with 18 multiple image systems with\nsecure photometric redshifts, we reconstruct the gravitational potential of the\ncluster pixellated on an adaptive grid, using a total of 72 images. The\nresulting mass map is compared with a stellar mass map obtained from the deep\nSpitzer Frontier Fields data to study the relative distribution of stars and\ndark matter in the cluster. We find that the stellar to total mass ratio varies\nsubstantially across the cluster field, suggesting that stars do not trace\nexactly the total mass in this interacting system. The maps of convergence,\nshear, and magnification are made available in the standard HFF format.\n", "  The physics of activated escape of objects out of a metastable state plays a\nkey role in diverse scientific areas involving chemical kinetics, diffusion and\ndislocation motion in solids, nucleation, electrical transport, motion of flux\nlines superconductors, charge density waves, and transport processes of\nmacromolecules, to name but a few. The underlying activated processes present\nthe multidimensional extension of the Kramers problem of a single Brownian\nparticle. In comparison to the latter case, however, the dynamics ensuing from\nthe interactions of many coupled units can lead to intriguing novel phenomena\nthat are not present when only a single degree of freedom is involved. In this\nreview we report on a variety of such phenomena that are exhibited by systems\nconsisting of chains of interacting units in the presence of potential\nbarriers.\n  In the first part we consider recent developments in the case of a\ndeterministic dynamics driving cooperative escape processes of coupled\nnonlinear units out of metastable states. The ability of chains of coupled\nunits to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a\nself-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units\nbecome re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming\nlocalised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present\nscenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the\nnoise-assisted case.\n  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of\ninteracting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential\nlandscapes. Escape processes in both time-homogeneous and time-dependent driven\nsystems are considered for the emergence of directed motion. It is shown that\nballistic channels immersed in the associated high-dimensional phase space are\nthe source for the directed long-range transport.\n", "  We present an ab initio calculation of the shear viscosity as a function of\ninteraction strength in a two-component unpolarized Fermi gas near the unitary\nlimit, within a finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework and\nusing the Kubo linear-response formalism. The shear viscosity decreases as we\ntune the interaction strength 1/ak_F from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer side of\nthe Feshbach resonance towards Bose-Einstein condensation limit and it acquires\nthe smallest value for 1/ak_F approx 0.4, with a minimum value of (eta/s)_min\napprox 0.2 hbar/k_B, which is about twice as small as the value reported for\nexperiments in quark-gluon plasma (eta/s)_QGP lesssim 0.4 hbar/k_B. The Fermi\ngas near unitarity thus emerges as the most \"perfect fluid\" observed so far in\nnature. The clouds of dilute Fermi gas near unitarity exhibit the unusual\nattribute that, for the sizes realized so far in the laboratory or larger (less\nthan 10^9 atoms), can sustain quantum turbulence below the critical\ntemperature, but at the same time the classical turbulence is suppressed in the\nnormal phase.\n", "  The critical properties of the stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected model\non a square lattice is studied by numerical simulations and by the use of\nscaling relations. In the presence of an infected individual, a susceptible\nbecomes either infected or exposed. Once infected or exposed, the individual\nremains forever in this state. The stationary properties are shown to be the\nsame as those of isotropic percolation so that the critical behavior puts the\nmodel into the universality class of dynamic percolation.\n", "  The lifetime of the metastable 5d$^2$D$_{5/2}$ state has been measured for a\nsingle trapped Ba$^+$ ion in a Paul trap in Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in the\n10$^{-10}$ mbar pressure range. A total of 5046 individual periods when the ion\nwas shelved in this state have been recorded. A preliminary value\n$\\tau_{D_{5/2}} = 26.4(1.7)$~s is obtained through extrapolation to zero\nresidual gas pressure.\n", "  We investigate dynamic properties of a plasma whose constituents are\nconfining gluons resulting from the Gribov quantization. In a static\nformulation, this system reproduces qualitatively the pure-glue equation of\nstate and thereby encodes crucial features of the phase transition. The dynamic\ndescription proposed in this work allows us to study non-equilibrium transport\nphenomena with the inclusion of confinement effects. In particular, we\ndetermine the non-equilibrium behaviour of the interaction measure (trace\nanomaly) and find the form of the bulk viscosity coefficient. The latter may be\nused in phenomenological applications to heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We present a measurement of the atmospheric $\\nu_e$ spectrum at energies\nbetween 0.1 TeV and 100 TeV using data from the first year of the complete\nIceCube detector. Atmospheric $\\nu_e$ originate mainly from the decays of kaons\nproduced in cosmic-ray air showers. This analysis selects 1078 fully contained\nevents in 332 days of livetime, then identifies those consistent with particle\nshowers. A likelihood analysis with improved event selection extends our\nprevious measurement of the conventional $\\nu_e$ fluxes to higher energies. The\ndata constrain the conventional $\\nu_e$ flux to be $1.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ times a\nbaseline prediction from a Honda's calculation, including the knee of the\ncosmic-ray spectrum. A fit to the kaon contribution ($\\xi$) to the neutrino\nflux finds a kaon component that is $\\xi =1.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ times the baseline\nvalue. The fitted/measured prompt neutrino flux from charmed hadron decays\nstrongly depends on the assumed astrophysical flux and shape. If the\nastrophysical component follows a power law, the result for the prompt flux is\n$0.0^{+3.0}_{-0.0}$ times a calculated flux based on the work by Enberg, Reno\nand Sarcevic.\n", "  High-precision frequencies of acoustic modes in red giant stars are now\navailable thanks to the long observing length and high-quality of the light\ncurves provided by the NASA Kepler mission, thus allowing to probe the interior\nof evolved cool low-mass stars with unprecedented level of detail. We\ncharacterize the acoustic signature of the helium second ionization zone in a\nsample of 18 low-mass low-luminosity red giants by exploiting new mode\nfrequency measurements derived from more than four years of Kepler\nobservations. We analyze the second frequency differences of radial acoustic\nmodes in all the stars of the sample by using the Bayesian code Diamonds. We\nfind clear acoustic glitches due to the signature of helium second ionization\nin all the stars of the sample. We measure the acoustic depth and the\ncharacteristic width of the acoustic glitches with a precision level on average\naround $\\sim$2% and $\\sim$8%, respectively. We find good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions and existing measurements from the literature. Lastly,\nwe derive the amplitude of the glitch signal at $\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ for the\nsecond differences and for the frequencies with an average precision of\n$\\sim$6%, obtaining values in the range 0.14-0.24 $\\mu$Hz, and 0.08-0.33\n$\\mu$Hz, respectively, which can be used to investigate the helium abundance in\nthe stars.\n", "  Heavy quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) play an important role in\nseveral Standard Model and New Physics processes. Most analyses rely on the\nassumption that the charm and bottom PDFs are generated perturbatively by gluon\nsplitting and do not involve any non-perturbative degrees of freedom. It is\nclearly necessary to test this hypothesis with suitable QCD processes.\nConversely, a non-perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark parton distribution has\nbeen predicted in the literature. We demonstrate that to a very good\napproximation the scale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the\nnucleon is governed by non-singlet evolution equations. This allows us to\nanalyze the intrinsic heavy quark distributions without having to resort to a\nfull-fledged global analysis of parton distribution functions. We exploit this\nfreedom to model intrinsic bottom distributions which are so far missing in the\nliterature in order to estimate the impact of this non-perturbative\ncontribution to the bottom-quark PDF, and on parton--parton luminosities at the\nLHC. This technique can be applied to the case of intrinsic charm, albeit\nwithin the limitations outlined in the following.\n", "  We present an analysis of the impact of the tree rings seen in the candidate\nsensors of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) on galaxy-shape\nmeasurements. The tree rings are a consequence of transverse electric fields\ncaused by circularly symmetric impurity gradients in the silicon of the\nsensors. They effectively modify the pixel area and shift the photogenerated\ncharge around, displacing the observed photon positions. The displacement\ndistribution generates distortions that cause spurious shears correlated with\nthe tree-rings patterns, potentially biasing cosmic shear measurements. In this\npaper we quantify the amplitude of the spurious shear caused by the tree rings\non the LSST candidate sensors, and calculate its 2-point correlation function.\nWe find that 2-point correlation function of the spurious shear on an area\nequivalent to the LSST field of view is order of about $10^{-13}$, providing a\nnegligible contribution to the 2-point correlation of the cosmic shear signal.\nAdditional work is underway, and the final results and analysis will be\npublished elsewhere (Okura et al. (2015), in prep.)\n", "  The experimental study of edge states in atomically-thin layered materials\nremains a challenge due to the difficult control of the geometry of the sample\nterminations, the stability of dangling bonds and the need to measure local\nproperties. In the case of graphene, localised edge modes have been predicted\nin zig-zag and bearded edges, characterised by flat dispersions connecting the\nDirac points. Polaritons in semiconductor microcavities have recently emerged\nas an extraordinary photonic platform to emulate 1D and 2D Hamiltonians,\nallowing the direct visualization of the wavefunctions in both real- and\nmomentum-space as well as of the energy dispersion of eigenstates via\nphotoluminescence experiments. Here we report on the observation of edge states\nin a honeycomb lattice of coupled micropillars. The lowest two bands of this\nstructure arise from the coupling of the lowest energy modes of the\nmicropillars, and emulate the {\\pi} and {\\pi}* bands of graphene. We show the\nmomentum space dispersion of the edge states associated to the zig-zag and\nbearded edges, holding unidimensional quasi-flat bands. Additionally, we\nevaluate polarisation effects characteristic of polaritons on the properties of\nthese states.\n", "  We search for the decay B+ -> l+ nu gamma with l+ = e+ or mu+ using the full\nBelle data set of 772 x 10^6 BBbar pairs, collected at the Y(4S) resonance with\nthe Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We reconstruct\none B meson in a hadronic decay mode and search for the B+ -> l+ nu gamma decay\nin the remainder of the event. We observe no significant signal within the\nphase space of E_gamma^sig > 1 GeV and obtain upper limits of BR(B+ -> e+ nu\ngamma) < 6.1 x 10^-6, BR(B+ -> mu+ nu gamma) < 3.4 x 10^-6, and BR(B+ -> l+ nu\ngamma) < 3.5 x 10^-6 at 90 % credibility level.\n", "  We use Spitzer observations of the rich population of Asymptotic Giant Branch\nstars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to test models describing the\ninternal structure and nucleosynthesis of the most massive of these stars, i.e.\nthose with initial mass above $\\sim 4M_{\\odot}$. To this aim, we compare\nSpitzer observations of LMC stars with the theoretical tracks of Asymptotic\nGiant Branch models, calculated with two of the most popular evolution codes,\nthat are known to differ in particular for the treatment of convection.\nAlthough the physical evolution of the two models are significantly different,\nthe properties of dust formed in their winds are surprisingly similar, as is\ntheir position in the colour-colour (CCD) and colour-magnitude (CMD) diagrams\nobtained with the Spitzer bands. This model independent result allows us to\nselect a well defined region in the ($[3.6]-[4.5], [5.8]-[8.0]$) plane,\npopulated by AGB stars experiencing Hot Bottom Burning, the progeny of stars\nwith mass $M\\sim 5.5M_{\\odot}$. This result opens up an important test of the\nstrength hot bottom burning using detailed near-IR (H and K bands)\nspectroscopic analysis of the oxygen-rich, high luminosity candidates found in\nthe well defined region of the colour-colour plane. This test is possible\nbecause the two stellar evolution codes we use predict very different results\nfor the surface chemistry, and the C/O ratio in particular, owing to their\ntreatment of convection in the envelope and of convective boundaries during\nthird dredge-up. The differences in surface chemistry are most apparent when\nthe model stars reach the phase with the largest infrared emission.\n", "  Physical vacuum is a special superfluid medium. Its motion is described by\nthe Navier-Stokes equation having two slightly modified terms that relate to\ninternal forces. They are the pressure gradient and the dissipation force\nbecause of viscosity. The modifications are as follows:\n  (a) the pressure gradient contains an added term describing the pressure\nmultiplied by the entropy gradient;\n  (b) time-averaged viscosity is zero, but its variance is not zero.\n  Owing to these modifications, the Navier-Stokes equation can be reduced to\nthe Schrodinger equation describing behavior of a particle into the vacuum,\nwhich looks like a superfluid medium populated by enormous amount of virtual\nparticle-antiparticle pairs.\n", "  The capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor can depend on applied magnetic\nfield. Previous studies have identified capacitance changes induced via\nclassical Lorentz force or spin-dependent Zeeman effects. Here we measure a\nmagnetization direction dependent capacitance in parallel-plate capacitors\nwhere one plate is a ferromagnetic semiconductor, gallium manganese arsenide.\nThis anisotropic magneto-capacitance is due to the anisotropy in the density of\nstates dependent on the magnetization through the strong spin-orbit\ninteraction.\n", "  The irradiation of a dilute cloud of cold atoms with a coherent light field\nproduces a random intensity distribution known as laser speckle. Its\nstatistical fluctuations contain information about the mesoscopic scattering\nprocesses at work inside the disordered medium. Following up on earlier work by\nAssaf and Akkermans [Phys.\\ Rev.\\ Lett.\\ \\textbf{98}, 083601 (2007)], we\nanalyze how static speckle intensity correlations are affected by an internal\nZeeman degeneracy of the scattering atoms. It is proven on general grounds that\nthe speckle correlations cannot exceed the standard Rayleigh law. On the\ncontrary, because which-path information is stored in the internal atomic\nstates, the intensity correlations suffer from strong decoherence and become\nexponentially small in the diffusive regime applicable to an optically thick\ncloud.\n", "  Linear optics underpins tests of fundamental quantum mechanics and computer\nscience, as well as quantum technologies. Here we experimentally demonstrate\nthe longstanding goal of a single reprogrammable optical circuit that is\nsufficient to implement all possible linear optical protocols up to the size of\nthat circuit. Our six-mode universal system consists of a cascade of 15\nMach-Zehnder interferometers with 30 thermo-optic phase shifters integrated\ninto a single photonic chip that is electrically and optically interfaced for\narbitrary setting of all phase shifters, input of up to six photons and their\nmeasurement with a 12 single-photon detector system. We programmed this system\nto implement heralded quantum logic and entangling gates, boson sampling with\nverification tests, and six-dimensional complex Hadamards. We implemented 100\nHaar random unitaries with average fidelity 0.999 $\\pm$ 0.001. Our system is\ncapable of switching between these and any other linear optical protocol in\nseconds. These results point the way to applications across fundamental science\nand quantum technologies.\n", "  An analysis of high-resolution near-infrared spectra of a sample of 45\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars towards the Galactic bulge is presented.\nThe sample consists of two subsamples, a larger one in the inner and\nintermediate bulge, and a smaller one in the outer bulge. The data are analysed\nwith the help of hydrostatic model atmospheres and spectral synthesis. We\nderive the radial velocity of all stars, and the atmospheric chemical mix\n([Fe/H], C/O, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, Al, Si, Ti, and Y) where possible. Our ability\nto model the spectra is mainly limited by the (in)completeness of atomic and\nmolecular line lists, at least for temperatures down to $T_{\\rm\neff}\\approx3100$ K. We find that the subsample in the inner and intermediate\nbulge is quite homogeneous, with a slightly sub-solar mean metallicity and only\nfew stars with super-solar metallicity, in agreement with previous studies of\nnon-variable M-type giants in the bulge. All sample stars are oxygen-rich,\nC/O$<$1.0. The C/O and carbon isotopic ratios suggest that third dredge-up\n(3DUP) is absent among the sample stars, except for two stars in the outer\nbulge that are known to contain technetium. These stars are also more\nmetal-poor than the stars in the intermediate or inner bulge. Current stellar\nmasses are determined from linear pulsation models. The masses, metallicities\nand 3DUP behaviour are compared to AGB evolutionary models. We conclude that\nthese models are partly in conflict with our observations. Furthermore, we\nconclude that the stars in the inner and intermediate bulge belong to a more\nmetal-rich population that follows bar-like kinematics, whereas the stars in\nthe outer bulge belong to the metal-poor, spheroidal bulge population.\n", "  With infrared spectroscopy we investigated the spin-reorientation transition\nfrom an orthorhombic antiferromagnetic (o-AF) to a tetragonal AF (t-AF) phase\nand the reentrance of the o-AF phase in the superconducting state of underdoped\nBa$ _{1-x} $K$ _{x} $Fe$ _{2} $As$ _{2} $. In agreement with the predicted\ntransition from a single-$\\mathbf{Q}$ to a double-$\\mathbf{Q}$ AF structure, we\nfound that a distinct spin density wave (SDW) develops in the t-AF phase. The\npair breaking peak of this SDW acquires much more low-energy spectral weight\nthan the one in the o-AF state which indicates that it competes more strongly\nwith superconductivity. We also observed additional phonon modes in the t-AF\nphase which likely arise from a Brillouin-zone folding that is induced by the\ndouble-$\\mathbf{Q}$ magnetic structure with two Fe sublattices exhibiting\ndifferent magnitudes of the magnetic moment.\n", "  We present an unitary dispersive model for the $\\eta \\to 3 \\pi$ decay process\nbased upon the Khuri-Treiman equations which are solved by means of the\nPasquier inversion method. The description of the hadronic final-state\ninteractions for the $\\eta \\to 3\\pi$ decay is essential to reproduce the\navailable data and to understand the existing discrepancies between Dalitz plot\nparameters from experiment and chiral perturbation theory. Our approach\nincorporates substraction constants that are fixed by fitting the recent\nhigh-statistics WASA-at-COSY data for $\\eta \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$. Based on\nthe parameters obtained we predict the slope parameter for the neutral channel\nto be $\\alpha=-0.022\\pm 0.004$. Through matching to next-to-leading order\nchiral perturbation theory we estimate the quark mass double ratio to be\n$Q=21.4 \\pm 0.4$.\n", "  Microvariability consists in small time scale variations of low amplitude in\nthe photometric light curves of quasars, and represents an important tool to\ninvestigate their inner core. Detection of quasar microvariations is\nchallenging for their non-periodicity, as well as the need for high monitoring\nfrequency and high signal-to-noise ratio. Statistical tests developed for the\nanalysis of quasar differential light curves usually show either low power or\nlow reliability, or both. In this paper we compare two statistical procedures\nthat include several stars to perform tests with enhanced power and high\nreliability. We perform light curve simulations of variable quasars and\nnon-variable stars, and analyze them with statistical procedures developed from\nthe F-test and the analysis of variance. The results show a large improvement\nin the power of both statistical probes, and a larger reliability, when several\nstars are included in the analysis. The results from the simulations agree with\nthose obtained from observations of real quasars. The high power and high\nreliability of the tests discussed in this paper improve the results that can\nbe obtained from short and long time scale variability studies. These\ntechniques are not limited to quasar variability; on the contrary, they can be\neasily implemented to other sources such as variable stars. Their applications\nto future research and to the analysis of large field photometric monitoring\narchives can reveal new variable sources.\n", "  A fraction of the early-type galaxy population hosts a prominent dust lane.\nMethods to quantify the dust content of these systems based on optical imaging\ndata usually yield dust masses which are an order of magnitude lower than dust\nmasses derived from the observed FIR emission. High-quality optical data from\nthe Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS) and FIR/submm observations from\nthe Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS) allow us to revisit previous methods\nto determine the dust content in galaxies and explore new ones. We aim to\nderive the dust mass in NGC 4370 from both optical and FIR data, and\ninvestigate the need to invoke a putative diffuse dust component. We create\ncolor and attenuation maps, which are converted to approximate dust mass maps\nbased on simple dust geometries. Dust masses are also derived from SED fits to\nFIR/submm observations. Finally, inverse radiative transfer fitting is\nperformed to investigate more complex dust geometries. The empirical methods\napplied to the optical data yield lower limits of 3.4e5 solar masses, an order\nof magnitude below the total dust masses derived from SED fitting. In contrast,\nradiative transfer models yield dust masses which are slightly lower, but fully\nconsistent with the FIR-derived mass. Dust is more likely to be distributed in\na ring around the centre of NGC 4370 as opposed to an exponential disc or a\nsimple foreground screen. Moreover, using inverse radiative transfer fitting,\nwe are able to constrain most of the parameters describing these geometries.\nThe resulting dust masses are high enough to account for the dust observed at\nFIR/submm wavelengths, so that no diffuse dust component needs to be invoked.\nWe furthermore caution for the interpretation of dust masses and optical depths\nbased on optical data alone, using overly simplistic star-dust geometries and\nthe neglect of scattering effects. [ABRIDGED]\n", "  We report on the first observations of $\\bar{B}^0 \\to D_1(2430)^0 \\omega$,\n$\\bar{B}^0 \\to D_1(2420)^0 \\omega$ and $\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^*_2(2460)^0 \\omega$\ndecays. The $\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{*+} \\rho(1450)^-$ decay is also observed. The\nbranching fraction measurements are based on $(771.6 \\pm 10.6)\\times 10^6$\n$B\\bar{B}$ events collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. The fractions of\nlongitudinal polarization of the $D^{**}$ states as well as partial wave\nfractions of the $D_1(2430)^0$ are obtained. We also set a $90\\%$ confidence\nlevel upper limit for the product of branching fractions of\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0 \\to D^{*+} b_1(1235)^-) \\times \\mathcal{B}(b_1(1235)^-\n\\to \\omega \\pi^-)$. The measurements show evidence of nontrivial final-state\ninteraction phases for the $\\rho$-like amplitudes.\n", "  A search for high-energy neutrinos coming from the direction of the Galactic\nCentre is performed using the data recorded by the ANTARES neutrino telescope\nfrom 2007 to 2012. The event selection criteria are chosen to maximise the\nsensitivity to possible signals produced by the self-annihilation of weakly\ninteracting massive particles accumulated around the centre of the Milky Way\nwith respect to the atmospheric background. After data unblinding, the number\nof neutrinos observed in the line of sight of the Galactic Centre is found to\nbe compatible with background expectations. The 90% C.L. upper limits in terms\nof the neutrino+anti-neutrino flux, $\\rm \\Phi_{\\nu_{\\mu}+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu}$, and\nthe velocity averaged annihilation cross-section, $\\rm <\\sigma_{A}v>$, are\nderived for the WIMP self-annihilation channels into $\\rm\nb\\bar{b},W^{+}W^{-},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-},\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-},\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$. The ANTARES\nlimits for $\\rm <\\sigma_{A}v>$ are shown to be the most stringent for a\nneutrino telescope over the WIMP masses $\\rm 25\\,GeV < M_{WIMP} < 10\\,TeV$.\n", "  Context. The prototypical low-mass young stellar object, T Tauri, is a\nwell-studied multiple system with at least three components. Aims. We aim to\nexplore the T Tau system with the highest spatial resolution, study the time\nevolution of the known components, and re-determine the orbital parameters of\nthe stars. Methods. Near-infrared classical imaging and integral field\nspectrograph observations were obtained during the Science Verification of\nSPHERE, the new high-contrast imaging facility at the VLT. The obtained FWHM of\nthe primary star varies between 0.050\" and 0.059\", making these the highest\nspatial resolution near-infrared images of the T Tauri system obtained to date.\nResults. Our near-infrared images confirm the presence of extended emission\nsouth of T Tau Sa, reported in the literature. New narrow-band images show, for\nthe first time, that this feature shows strong emission in both the Br-{\\gamma}\nand H2 1-0 S(1) lines. Broadband imaging at 2.27 {\\mu}m shows that T Tau Sa is\n0.92 mag brighter than T Tau Sb, which is in contrast to observations from Jan.\n2014 (when T Tau Sa was fainter than Sb), and demonstrates that T Tau Sa has\nentered a new period of high variability. The newly obtained astrometric\npositions of T Tau Sa and Sb agree with orbital fits from previous works. The\norbit of T Tau S (the center of gravity of Sa and Sb) around T Tau N is poorly\nconstrained by the available observations and can be fit with a range of orbits\nranging from a nearly circular orbit with a period of 475 years to highly\neccentric orbits with periods up to 2.7*10^4 years. We also detected a feature\nsouth of T Tau N, at a distance of $144 \\pm 3$ mas, which shows the properties\nof a new companion.\n", "  The replica method for calculating the von Neumann entropy is reviewed.\nExplicit expression for the entropy of the mixed coherent states $|\\alpha>$ and\n$|\\beta>$ is obtained using this method. The purity inequality for bipartite\nsystem for separable states is studied on example of even and odd\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger cat state.\n", "  We present results on the K*(892)+ production in proton-proton collisions at\na beam energy of E = 3.5 GeV, which is hitherto the lowest energy at which this\nmesonic resonance has been observed in nucleon-nucleon reactions. The data are\ninterpreted within a two-channel model that includes the 3-body production of\nK*(892)+ associated with the Lambda- or Sigma-hyperon. The relative\ncontributions of both channels are estimated. Besides the total cross section\nsigma(p+p -> K*(892)+ + X) = 9.5 +- 0.9 +1.1 -0.9 +- 0.7 mub, that adds a new\ndata point to the excitation function of the K*(892)+ production in the region\nof low excess energy, transverse momenta and angular spectra are extracted and\ncompared with the predictions of the two-channel model. The spin\ncharacteristics of K*(892)+ are discussed as well in terms of the\nspin-alignment.\n", "  We introduce a grating assisted tunneling scheme for tunable synthetic\nmagnetic fields in photonic lattices, which can be implemented at optical\nfrequencies in optically induced one- and two-dimensional dielectric photonic\nlattices. We demonstrate a conical diffraction pattern in particular\nrealization of these lattices which possess Dirac points in $k$-space, as a\nsignature of the synthetic magnetic fields. The two-dimensional photonic\nlattice with grating assisted tunneling constitutes the realization of the\nHarper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian.\n", "  We study the chaos decomposition of self-intersection local times and their\nregularization, with a particular view towards Varadhan's renormalization for\nthe planar Edwards model.\n", "  Neutron scattering is used to study\nNiCl$_{2-2x}$Br$_{2x}\\cdot$4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$, $x=0.06$, a bond-disordered\nmodification of the well-known gapped $S=1$ antiferromagnetic quantum spin\nsystem NiCl$_{2}\\cdot$4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$. The magnetic excitation spectrum\nthroughout Brillouin zone is mapped out at $T=60$ mK using high-resolution\ntime-of-flight spectroscopy. It is found that the dispersion of spin excitation\nis renormalized, as compared to that in the parent compound. The lifetime of\nexcitations near the bottom of the band is substantially decreased. No\nlocalized states are found below the gap energy $\\Delta\\simeq0.2$ meV. At the\nsame time, localized zero wave vector states are detected above the top of the\nband. The results are consistent with a more or less continuous random\ndistribution of bond strengths, and a discrete, possibly bimodal, distribution\nof single-ion anisotropies in the disordered material.\n", "  We present an experimental study of macroscopic and microscopic magnetic\nanisotropy of a spin tetramer system \\cso using torque magnetometry and ESR\nspectroscopy. Large rotation of macroscopic magnetic axes with temperature\nobserved from torque magnetometry agrees reasonably well with the rotation of\nthe $\\mathbf{g}$ tensor above $T \\gtrsim 50$~K. Below 50~K, the $\\mathbf{g}$\ntensor is temperature independent, while macroscopic magnetic axes continue to\nrotate. Additionally, the susceptibility anisotropy has a temperature\ndependence which cannot be reconciled with the isotropic Heisenberg model of\ninteractions between spins. ESR linewidth analysis shows that anisotropic\nexchange interaction must be present in \\csos. These findings strongly support\nthe presence of anisotropic exchange interactions in the Hamiltonian of the\nstudied system. Below $T_N=8$~K, the system enters a long - range\nantiferromagnetically ordered state with easy axis along the $<\\bar{1} 0 1>^*$\ndirection. Small but significant rotation of magnetic axes is also observed in\nthe antiferromagnetically ordered state suggesting strong spin-lattice coupling\nin this system.\n", "  We present first results on polarization swings in optical emission of\nblazars obtained by RoboPol, a monitoring program of an unbiased sample of\ngamma-ray bright blazars specially designed for effective detection of such\nevents. A possible connection of polarization swing events with periods of high\nactivity in gamma rays is investigated using the dataset obtained during the\nfirst season of operation. It was found that the brightest gamma-ray flares\ntend to be located closer in time to rotation events, which may be an\nindication of two separate mechanisms responsible for the rotations. Blazars\nwith detected rotations have significantly larger amplitude and faster\nvariations of polarization angle in optical than blazars without rotations. Our\nsimulations show that the full set of observed rotations is not a likely\noutcome (probability $\\le 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}$) of a random walk of the\npolarization vector simulated by a multicell model. Furthermore, it is highly\nunlikely ($\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-5}$) that none of our rotations is physically\nconnected with an increase in gamma-ray activity.\n", "  Concerted effort is currently ongoing to open up the Epoch of Reionization\n(EoR) ($z\\sim$15-6) for studies with IR and radio telescopes. Whereas IR\ndetections have been made of sources (Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters, quasars and\ndrop-outs) in this redshift regime in relatively small fields of view, no\ndirect detection of neutral hydrogen, via the redshifted 21-cm line, has yet\nbeen established. Such a direct detection is expected in the coming years, with\nongoing surveys, and could open up the entire universe from $z\\sim$6-200 for\nastrophysical and cosmological studies, opening not only the EoR, but also its\npreceding Cosmic Dawn ($z\\sim$30-15) and possibly even the later phases of the\nDark Ages ($z\\sim$200-30). All currently ongoing experiments attempt\nstatistical detections of the 21-cm signal during the EoR, with limited\nsignal-to-noise. Direct imaging, except maybe on the largest (degree) scales at\nlower redshifts, as well as higher redshifts will remain out of reach. The\nSquare Kilometre Array(SKA) will revolutionize the field, allowing direct\nimaging of neutral hydrogen from scales of arc-minutes to degrees over most of\nthe redshift range $z\\sim$6-28 with SKA1-LOW, and possibly even higher\nredshifts with the SKA2-LOW. In this SKA will be unique, and in parallel\nprovide enormous potential of synergy with other upcoming facilities (e.g.\nJWST). In this chapter we summarize the physics of 21-cm emission, the\ndifferent phases the universe is thought to go through, and the observables\nthat the SKA can probe, referring where needed to detailed chapters in this\nvolume (Abridged).\n", "  We observed with the JVLA at 3.6 and 1.3 cm a sample of 11 proto-brown dwarf\ncandidates in Taurus in a search for thermal radio jets driven by the most\nembedded brown dwarfs. We detected for the first time four thermal radio jets\nin proto-brown dwarf candidates. We compiled data from UKIDSS, 2MASS, Spitzer,\nWISE and Herschel to build the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the\nobjects in our sample, which are similar to typical Class~I SEDs of Young\nStellar Objects (YSOs). The four proto-brown dwarf candidates driving thermal\nradio jets also roughly follow the well-known trend of centimeter luminosity\nagainst bolometric luminosity determined for YSOs, assuming they belong to\nTaurus, although they present some excess of radio emission compared to the\nknown relation for YSOs. Nonetheless, we are able to reproduce the flux\ndensities of the radio jets modeling the centimeter emission of the thermal\nradio jets using the same type of models applied to YSOs, but with\ncorresponding smaller stellar wind velocities and mass-loss rates, and\nexploring different possible geometries of the wind or outflow from the star.\nMoreover, we also find that the modeled mass outflow rates for the bolometric\nluminosities of our objects agree reasonably well with the trends found between\nthe mass outflow rates and bolometric luminosities of YSOs, which indicates\nthat, despite the \"excess\" centimeter emission, the intrinsic properties of\nproto-brown dwarfs are consistent with a continuation of those of very low mass\nstars to a lower mass range. Overall, our study favors the formation of brown\ndwarfs as a scaled-down version of low-mass stars.\n", "  We perform a theoretical study on direct $CP$ violation in $D^\\pm\\to \\pi^\\pm\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ in phase space around the intermediate states $\\rho^0(770)$ and\n$f_0(500)$. The possible interference between the amplitudes corresponding to\nthe two resonances is taken into account, and the relative strong phase of the\ntwo amplitudes is treated as a free parameter. Our analysis shows that by\nproperly chosen the strong phase, both the $CP$ violation strength and\ndifferential decay width accommodate to the experimental results.\n", "  The CALIFA team has recently found that the stellar angular momentum and\nconcentration of late-type spiral galaxies are incompatible with those of\nlenticular galaxies (S0s), concluding that fading alone cannot satisfactorily\nexplain the evolution from spirals into S0s. Here we explore whether major\nmergers can provide an alternative way to transform spirals into S0s by\nanalysing the spiral-spiral major mergers from the GalMer database that lead to\nrealistic, relaxed S0-like galaxies. We find that the change in stellar angular\nmomentum and concentration can explain the differences in the\n$\\lambda_\\mathrm{Re}$--$R_{90}/R_{50}$ plane found by the CALIFA team. Major\nmergers thus offer a feasible explanation for the transformation of spirals\ninto S0s.\n", "  We present the detection of a giant radio halo (GRH) in the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)-selected merging galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0256.5+0006 ($z\n= 0.363$), observed with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 325 MHz and 610\nMHz. We find this cluster to host a faint ($S_{610} = 5.6 \\pm 1.4$ mJy) radio\nhalo with an angular extent of 2.6 arcmin, corresponding to 0.8 Mpc at the\ncluster redshift, qualifying it as a GRH. J0256 is one of the lowest-mass\nsystems, $M_{\\rm 500,SZ} = (5.0 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^{14} M_\\odot$, found to host\na GRH. We measure the GRH at lower significance at 325 MHz ($S_{325} = 10.3 \\pm\n5.3$ mJy), obtaining a spectral index measurement of $\\alpha^{610}_{325} =\n1.0^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$. This result is consistent with the mean spectral index of\nthe population of typical radio halos, $\\alpha = 1.2 \\pm 0.2$. Adopting the\nlatter value, we determine a 1.4 GHz radio power of $P_{1.4\\text{GHz}} = (1.0\n\\pm 0.3) \\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, placing this cluster within the scatter\nof known scaling relations. Various lines of evidence, including the ICM\nmorphology, suggest that ACT-CL J0256.5+0006 is composed of two subclusters. We\ndetermine a merger mass ratio of 7:4, and a line-of-sight velocity difference\nof $v_\\perp = 1880 \\pm 280$ km s$^{-1}$. We construct a simple merger model to\ninfer relevant time-scales in the merger. From its location on the $P_{\\rm\n1.4GHz}{-}L_{\\rm X}$ scaling relation, we infer that we observe ACT-CL\nJ0256.5+0006 approximately 500 Myr before first core crossing.\n", "  Context: Several hundred candidate hybrid pulsators of type A-F have been\nidentified from space-based observations. Their large number allows both\nstatistical analyses and detailed investigations of individual stars. This\noffers the opportunity to study the full interior of the genuine hybrids, in\nwhich both low-radial-order p- and high-order g-modes are self-excited at the\nsame time. However, a few other physical processes can also be responsible for\nthe observed hybrid nature, related to binarity or to surface inhomogeneities.\nThe finding that most delta Scuti stars also show long-period light variations\nrepresents a real challenge for theory.\n  Methods: Fourier analysis of all the available Kepler light curves.\nInvestigation of the frequency and period spacings. Determination of the\nstellar physical parameters from spectroscopic observations. Modelling of the\ntransit events.\n  Results: The Fourier analysis of the Kepler light curves revealed 55\nsignificant frequencies clustered into two groups, which are separated by a gap\nbetween 15 and 27 c/d. The light variations are dominated by the beating of two\ndominant frequencies located at around 4 c/d. The amplitudes of these two\nfrequencies show a monotonic long-term trend. The frequency spacing analysis\nrevealed two possibilities: the pulsator is either a highly inclined moderate\nrotator (v~70 km/s, i > 70 deg) or a fast rotator (v~200 km/s) with i~20 deg.\nThe transit analysis disclosed that the transit events which occur with a ~197\nc/d period may be caused by a 1.6 R_Jup body orbiting a fainter star, which\nwould be spatially coincident with KIC 9533489.\n", "  The [CII]158um line is one of the dominant cooling lines in star-forming\nactive regions. The commonly assumed clumpy UV-penetrated cloud models predict\na [CII] line profile similar to that of CO. However, recent spectral-resolved\nobservations show that they are often very different, indicating a more complex\norigin of the line emission including the dynamics of the source region. The\naim of our study is to investigate the physical properties of the star-forming\nISM in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by separating the origin of the\nemission lines spatially and spectrally. In this paper, we focus on the\nspectral characteristics and the origin of the emission lines, and the phases\nof carbon-bearing species in the N159 star-forming region in the LMC. We mapped\na 4'x(3-4)' region in N159 in [CII]158um and [NII]205um with the GREAT on board\nSOFIA, and in CO(3-2), (4-3), (6-5), 13CO(3-2), and [CI]3P1-3P0 and 3P2-3P1\nwith APEX. The emission of all transitions observed shows a large variation in\nthe line profiles across the map and between the different species. At most\npositions the [CII] emission line profile is substantially wider than that of\nCO and [CI]. We estimated the fraction of the [CII] integrated line emission\nthat cannot be fitted by the CO line profile to be 20%-50%. We derived the\nrelative contribution from C+, C, and CO to the column density in each velocity\nbin. The contribution from C+ dominates the velocity range far from the\nvelocities traced by the dense molecular gas, and the region located between\nthe CO cores of N159 W and E. We estimate the contribution of the ionized gas\nto the [CII] emission using the ratio to the [NII] emission to be < 19% to the\n[CII] emission at its peak position, and <15% over the whole observed region.\nUsing the integrated line intensities, we present the spatial distribution of\nI([CII])/I(FIR). (abridged for arXiv)\n", "  We study the band-centre anomaly in the one-dimensional Anderson model with\nweak correlated disorder. Our analysis is based on the Hamiltonian map\napproach; the correspondence between the discrete model and its continuous\ncounterpart is discussed in detail. We obtain analytical expressions of the\nlocalisation length and of the invariant measure of the phase variable, valid\nfor energies in a neighbourhood of the band centre. By applying these general\nresults to specific forms of correlated disorder, we show how correlations can\nenhance or suppress the anomaly at the band centre.\n", "  Atomic clock technology is advancing rapidly, now reaching stabilities of\n$\\Delta f/f \\sim 10^{-18}$, which corresponds to resolving $1$ cm in equivalent\ngeoid height over an integration timescale of about 7 hours. At this level of\nperformance, ground-based atomic clock networks emerge as a tool for monitoring\na variety of geophysical processes by directly measuring changes in the\ngravitational potential. Vertical changes of the clock's position due to\nmagmatic, volcanic, post-seismic or tidal deformations can result in measurable\nvariations in the clock tick rate. As an example, we discuss the geopotential\nchange arising due to an inflating point source (Mogi model), and apply it to\nthe Etna volcano. Its effect on an observer on the Earth's surface can be\ndivided into two different terms: one purely due to uplift and one due to the\nredistribution of matter. Thus, with the centimetre-level precision of current\nclocks it is already possible to monitor volcanoes. The matter redistribution\nterm is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller than the uplift term,\nand should be resolvable when clocks improve their stability to the\nsub-millimetre level. Additionally, clocks can be compared over distances of\nthousands of kilometres on a short-term basis (e.g. hourly). These clock\nnetworks will improve our ability to monitor periodic effects with\nlong-wavelength like the solid Earth tide.\n", "  We explore the magnetic Feshbach spectra of ultracold ground-state Li+Er\nsystems. Our calculations predict many tunable resonances at fields below 1000\nG that could be stably tuned in ultracold experiments. We show that Li+Er\nspectra are much less congested than those of systems involving heavier\nhighly-magnetic atoms and exhibit non-chaotic properties. These features would\nfacilitate identifying and addressing individual resonances. We derive a simple\nmodel for the mass-scaling shifting of low-field resonances that may simplify\ndesigning experiments with different Er bosonic isotopes. Our work establishes\nLi+Er as very promising systems for quantum simulation, precision measurements\nand the formation of polar paramagnetic molecules.\n", "  Due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) an electric current flowing in a normal\nmetal or semiconductor can induce a bulk magnetic moment. This effect is known\nas the Edelstein (EE) or magneto-electric effect. Similarly, in a bulk\nsuperconductor a phase gradient may create a finite spin density. The inverse\neffect, also known as the spin-galvanic effect, corresponds to the creation of\na supercurrent by an equilibrium spin polarization. Here, by exploiting the\nanalogy between a linear-in-momentum SOC and a background SU(2) gauge field, we\ndevelop a quasiclassical transport theory to deal with magneto-electric effects\nin superconducting structures. For bulk superconductors this approach allows us\nto easily reproduce and generalize a number of previously known results. For\nJosephson junctions we establish a direct connection between the inverse EE and\nthe appearance of an anomalous phase-shift $\\varphi_{0}$ in the current-phase\nrelation. In particular we show that $\\varphi_{0}$ is proportional to the\nequilibrium spin-current in the weak link. We also argue that our results are\nvalid generically, beyond the particular case of linear-in-momentum SOC. The\nmagneto-electric effects discussed in this study may find applications in the\nemerging field of coherent spintronics with superconductors.\n", "  Processes involving alpha particles and alpha-like nuclei comprise a major\npart of stellar nucleosynthesis and hypothesized mechanisms for thermonuclear\nsupernovae. In an effort towards understanding alpha processes from first\nprinciples, we describe in this letter the first ab initio calculation of\nalpha-alpha scattering. We use lattice effective field theory to describe the\nlow-energy interactions of nucleons and apply a technique called the adiabatic\nprojection method to reduce the eight-body system to an effective two-cluster\nsystem. We find good agreement between lattice results and experimental phase\nshifts for S-wave and D-wave scattering. The computational scaling with\nparticle number suggests that alpha processes involving heavier nuclei are also\nwithin reach in the near future.\n", "  Strong-field physics is currently experiencing a shift towards the use of\nmid-IR driving wavelengths. This is because they permit conducting experiments\nunambiguously in the quasi-static regime and enable exploiting the effects\nrelated to ponderomotive scaling of electron recollisions. Initial measurements\ntaken in the mid-IR immediately led to a deeper understanding of\nphoto-ionization and allowed a discrimination amongst different theoretical\nmodels. Ponderomotive scaling of rescattering has enabled new avenues towards\ntime resolved probing of molecular structure. Essential for this paradigm shift\nwas the convergence of two experimental tools: 1) intense mid-IR sources that\ncan create high energy photons and electrons while operating within the\nquasi-static regime, and 2) detection systems that can detect the generated\nhigh energy particles and image the entire momentum space of the interaction in\nfull coincidence. Here we present a unique combination of these two essential\ningredients, namely a 160\\~kHz mid-IR source and a reaction microscope\ndetection system, to present an experimental methodology that provides an\nunprecedented three-dimensional view of strong-field interactions. The system\nis capable of generating and detecting electron energies that span a six order\nof magnitude dynamic range. We demonstrate the versatility of the system by\ninvestigating electron recollisions, the core process that drives strong-field\nphenomena, at both low (meV) and high (hundreds of eV) energies. The low energy\nregion is used to investigate recently discovered low-energy structures, while\nthe high energy electrons are used to probe atomic structure via laser-induced\nelectron diffraction. Moreover we present, for the first time, the correlated\nmomentum distribution of electrons from non-sequential double-ionization driven\nby mid-IR pulses.\n", "  We propose and investigate bounds on quantum process fidelity of quantum\nfilters, i.e. probabilistic quantum operations represented by a single Kraus\noperator K. These bounds generalize the Hofmann bounds on quantum process\nfidelity of unitary operations [H.F. Hofmann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 160504\n(2005)], and are based on probing the quantum filter by pure states forming two\nmutually unbiased bases. Determination of these bounds therefore requires much\nless measurements than full quantum process tomography. We find that it is\nparticularly suitable to construct one of the probe basis from the right\neigenstates of K, because in this case the bounds are tight in the sense that\nif the actual filter coincides with the ideal one then both the lower and upper\nbounds are equal to one. We theoretically investigate application of these\nbounds to a two-qubit optical quantum filter formed by interference of two\nphotons on a partially polarizing beam splitter. For experimentally convenient\nchoice of factorized input states and measurements we study the tightness of\nthe bounds. We show that more stringent bounds can be obtained by more\nsophisticated processing of the data using convex optimization and we compare\nour methods for different choice of the input probe states.\n", "  We apply a simple analytical method based on a unitary transformation to\ncalculate the Bloch-Siegert (BS) shift over the entire driving-strength range.\nIn quantitative comparison with the numerically exact BS shift obtained by\nFloquet formalism as well as the previous BS results, we confirm that our\ncalculated results are not only accurate in the weak-driving regime but also\ncorrect in strong-driving limit. In the intermediate strong-driving regime, the\ncalculated values of the BS shift are nearly the same as the exact ones. It\nturns out that our calculation for the BS shift is beyond perturbation.\nMeanwhile, we demonstrate the signatures caused by the BS shift by monitoring\nthe excited-state population and the probe-pump spectrum under the experiment\naccessible conditions. In particular, we find that when the driving frequency\nis fixed at the transition frequency of the system, the lineshape of the\nprobe-pump spectrum becomes asymmetric with the increase of the driving\nstrength, which may be verified experimentally.\n", "  We investigate the localized surface modes in a structure consisting of the\ncholesteric liquid crystal layer, a phase plate, and a metal layer. These modes\nare analogous to the optical Tamm states. The nonreciprocal transmission of\npolarized light propagating in the forward and backward directions is\nestablished. It is demonstrated that the transmission spectrum can be\ncontrolled by external fields acting on the cholesteric liquid crystal and by\nvarying the plane of polarization of the incident light. [The text is presented\nboth in English (pp 1-9) and in Russian (pp 10-19)]\n", "  We study the long time behavior of solutions to a nonlinear partial\ndifferential equation arising in the description of trapped rotating\nBose-Einstein condensates. The equation can be seen as a hybrid between the\nwell-known nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the\nGinzburg-Landau equation. We prove existence and uniqueness of global in-time\nsolutions in the physical energy space and establish the existence of a global\nattractor within the associated dynamics. We also obtain basic structural\nproperties of the attractor and an estimate on its Hausdorff and fractal\ndimensions.\n", "  Weyl semimetals typically appear in systems in which either time-reversal (T)\nor inversion (P}) symmetry are broken. Here we show that in the presence of\ngauge potentials these topological states of matter can also arise in fermionic\nlattices preserving both T and P. We analyze in detail the case of a cubic\nlattice model with $\\pi$-fluxes, discussing the role of gauge symmetries in the\nformation of Weyl points and the difference between the physical and the\ncanonical T and P symmetries. Motivated by advances in ultracold atom\nexperiments and by the possibility of using synthetic magnetic fields, we\nexamine the robustness of the Weyl semimetal phase in the presence of trapping\npotentials and random perturbations of the magnetic fluxes, which can be\ncompared to a local disorder in realistic scenarios.\n", "  We study the nature of spin excitations of individual transition metal atoms\n(Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni) deposited on a Cu$_2$N/Cu(100) surface using\nboth spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) and exact diagonalization\nof an Anderson model derived from DFT. We use DFT to compare the structural,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of different transition metal adatoms on the\nsurface. We find that the average occupation of the transition metal d shell,\nmain contributor to the magnetic moment, is not quantized, in contrast with the\nquantized spin in the model Hamiltonians that successfully describe spin\nexcitations in this system. In order to reconcile these two pictures, we build\na multi-orbital Anderson Hamiltonian for the d shell of the transition metal\nhybridized with the p orbitals of the adjacent Nitrogen atoms, by means of\nmaximally localized Wannier function representation of the DFT Hamiltonian. The\nexact solutions of this model have quantized total spin, without quantized\ncharge at the d shell. We propose that the quantized spin of the models\nactually belongs to many-body states with two different charge configurations\nin the d shell, hybridized with the p orbital of the adjacent Nitrogen atoms.\nThis scenario implies that the measured spin excitations are not fully\nlocalized at the transition metal.\n", "  Located in the Perseus cluster, NGC 1271 is an early-type galaxy with a small\neffective radius of 2.2 kpc and a large stellar velocity dispersion of 276 km/s\nfor its K-band luminosity of 8.9x10^{10} L_sun. We present a mass measurement\nfor the black hole in this compact, high-dispersion galaxy using observations\nfrom the integral field spectrograph NIFS on the Gemini North telescope\nassisted by laser guide star adaptive optics, large-scale integral field unit\nobservations with PPAK at the Calar Alto Observatory, and Hubble Space\nTelescope WFC3 imaging observations. We are able to map out the stellar\nkinematics on small spatial scales, within the black hole sphere of influence,\nand on large scales that extend out to four times the galaxy's effective\nradius. We find that the galaxy is rapidly rotating and exhibits a sharp rise\nin the velocity dispersion. Through the use of orbit-based stellar dynamical\nmodels, we determine that the black hole has a mass of (3.0^{+1.0}_{-1.1}) x\n10^9 M_sun and the H-band stellar mass-to-light ratio is 1.40^{+0.13}_{-0.11}\nM_sun/L_sun (1-sigma uncertainties). NGC 1271 occupies the sparsely-populated\nupper end of the black hole mass distribution, but is very different from the\nBrightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) and giant elliptical galaxies that are\nexpected to host the most massive black holes. Interestingly, the black hole\nmass is an order of magnitude larger than expectations based on the galaxy's\nbulge luminosity, but is consistent with the mass predicted using the galaxy's\nbulge stellar velocity dispersion. More compact, high-dispersion galaxies need\nto be studied using high spatial resolution observations to securely determine\nblack hole masses, as there could be systematic differences in the black hole\nscaling relations between these types of galaxies and the BCGs/giant\nellipticals, thereby implying different pathways for black hole and galaxy\ngrowth.\n", "  The examination of two 2010 Chandra ACIS exposures of the Circinus galaxy\nresulted in the discovery of two pulsators: CXO J141430.1-651621 and CXOU\nJ141332.9-651756. We also detected 26-ks pulsations in CG X-1, consistently\nwith previous measures. For ~40 other sources, we obtained limits on periodic\nmodulations. In CXO J141430.1-651621, which is ~2 arcmin outside the Circinus\ngalaxy, we detected signals at 6120(1) s and 64.2(5) ks. In the longest\nobservation, the source showed a flux of ~1.1e-13 erg/cm^2/s (absorbed, 0.5-10\nkeV) and the spectrum could be described by a power-law with photon index ~1.4.\nFrom archival observations, we found that the luminosity is variable by ~50 per\ncent on time-scales of weeks-years. The two periodicities pin down CXO\nJ141430.1-651621 as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar subtype.\nThe period of CXOU J141332.9-651756 is 6378(3) s. It is located inside the\nCircinus galaxy, but the low absorption indicates a Galactic foreground object.\nThe flux was ~5e-14 erg/cm^2/s in the Chandra observations and showed ~50 per\ncent variations on weekly/yearly scales; the spectrum is well fit by a power\nlaw ~0.9. These characteristics and the large modulation suggest that CXOU\nJ141332.9-651756 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable, probably a polar. For CG\nX-1, we show that if the source is in the Circinus galaxy, its properties are\nconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet plus black hole binary. We consider the\nimplications of this for ultraluminous X-ray sources and the prospects of\nAdvanced LIGO and Virgo. In particular, from the current sample of WR-BH\nsystems we estimate an upper limit to the detection rate of stellar BH-BH\nmergers of ~16 events per yr.\n", "  The NEMO-3 detector, which had been operating in the Modane Underground\nLaboratory from 2003 to 2010, was designed to search for neutrinoless double\n$\\beta$ ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay. We report final results of a search for\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays with $6.914$ kg of $^{100}$Mo using the entire NEMO-3\ndata set with a detector live time of $4.96$ yr, which corresponds to an\nexposure of 34.3 kg$\\cdot$yr. We perform a detailed study of the expected\nbackground in the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ signal region and find no evidence of\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays in the data. The level of observed background in the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ signal region $[2.8-3.2]$ MeV is $0.44 \\pm 0.13$ counts/yr/kg,\nand no events are observed in the interval $[3.2-10]$ MeV. We therefore derive\na lower limit on the half-life of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays in $^{100}$Mo of\n$T_{1/2}(0\\nu\\beta\\beta)> 1.1 \\times 10^{24}$ yr at the $90\\%$ Confidence\nLevel, under the hypothesis of light Majorana neutrino exchange. Depending on\nthe model used for calculating nuclear matrix elements, the limit for the\neffective Majorana neutrino mass lies in the range $\\langle m_{\\nu} \\rangle <\n0.33$--$0.62$ eV. We also report constraints on other lepton-number violating\nmechanisms for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays.\n", "  Complex oxide heterostructures are hot candidates for post CMOS\nmulti-functional devices. Especially in spintronics applications ferromagnetic\noxides may play a key role because they can exhibit extraordinary high spin\npolarization. Indeed, there are already plenty of examples in spintronics,\nnotably in the area of spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE)\n\\cite{Azevedo2011, Czeschka2011, Hahn2013, Obstbaum2014}. Although complex\noxides have been used in these experiments as a source of spin currents, they\nhave never been demonstrated to act as a spin sink that exhibits ISHE. Here we\nshow that in a heterostructure consisting of La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$\n(LSMO) and SrRuO$_{3}$ (SRO) the low temperature ferromagnet SRO can act as a\nspin sink and exhibit a sizeable ISHE which persists even below its Curie\ntemperature. This result opens up new possibilities for application of all\noxide heterostructures in spintronics and may significantly extend the research\non spin Hall effect and related phenomena.\n", "  In this work we consider the $SU(N)$ gauge theory with two Dirac fermions in\nthe adjoint representation, in the limit of large $N$. In this limit the\ninfinite-volume physics of this model can be studied by means of the\ncorresponding twisted reduced model defined on a single site lattice. Making\nuse of this strategy we study the reduced model for various values of $N$ up to\n289. By analyzing the eigenvalue distribution of the adjoint Dirac operator we\ntest the conformality of the theory and extract the corresponding mass\nanomalous dimension.\n", "  We show that the entanglement spectrum associated with a certain class of\nstrongly correlated many-body states --- the wave functions proposed by\nLaughlin and Jain to describe the fractional quantum Hall effect --- can be\nvery well described in terms of a simple model of non-interacting (or weakly\ninteracting) composite fermions.\n", "  The film growth of Mn$_3$O$_4$(001) films on Ag(001) up to film thicknesses\nof almost seven unit cells of Mn$_3$O$_4$ has been monitored using a\ncomplementary combination of near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure\nspectroscopy (NEXAFS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and low-energy\nelectron diffraction (LEED). The oxide films have been prepared by molecular\nbeam epitaxy. Using NEXAFS, the identity of the Mn oxide has clearly been\ndetermined as Mn$_3$O$_4$. For the initial stages of growth, oxide islands with\np(2$\\times$1) and p(2$\\times$2) structures are formed, which are embedded into\nthe substrate. For Mn$_3$O$_4$ coverages up to 1.5 unit cells a p(2$\\times$1)\nstructure of the films is visible in STM and LEED. Further increase of the\nthickness leads to a phase transition of the oxide films resulting in an\nadditional c(2$\\times$2) structure with a 45$^\\circ$ rotated atomic pattern.\nThe emerging film structures are discussed on the basis of a sublayer model of\nthe Mn$_3$O$_4$ spinel unit cell. While the polarity of the island edges\ndetermines the structure of initial islands, the surface energy of thicker\nlayers is remarkably reduced by a film restructuring.\n", "  The ANTARES telescope is well-suited for detecting astrophysical transient\nneutrino sources as it can observe a full hemisphere of the sky at all times\nwith a high duty cycle. The background due to atmospheric particles can be\ndrastically reduced, and the point-source sensitivity improved, by selecting a\nnarrow time window around possible neutrino production periods. Blazars, being\nradio-loud active galactic nuclei with their jets pointing almost directly\ntowards the observer, are particularly attractive potential neutrino point\nsources, since they are among the most likely sources of the very high-energy\ncosmic rays. Neutrinos and gamma rays may be produced in hadronic interactions\nwith the surrounding medium. Moreover, blazars generally show high time\nvariability in their light curves at different wavelengths and on various time\nscales. This paper presents a time-dependent analysis applied to a selection of\nflaring gamma-ray blazars observed by the FERMI/LAT experiment and by TeV\nCherenkov telescopes using five years of ANTARES data taken from 2008 to 2012.\nThe results are compatible with fluctuations of the background. Upper limits on\nthe neutrino fluence have been produced and compared to the measured gamma-ray\nspectral energy distribution.\n", "  A proper theoretical description of electronic structure of the 3d orbitals\nin the metal centers of functional metalorganics is a challenging problem. In\nthis letter, we apply density functional theory and an exact diagonalization\nmethod in a many body approach to study the ground state electronic\nconfiguration of an iron porphyrin (FeP) molecule. Our study reveals that\ndynamical correlation effects are important, and FeP is a potential candidate\nfor realizing a spin crossover due to a subtle balance of crystal field\neffects, on-site Coulomb repulsion and hybridization between the Fe d-orbitals\nand ligand N p-states. The mechanism of switching between two close lying\nelectronic configurations of Fe-d orbitals is shown. We discuss the generality\nof the suggested approach and the possibility to properly describe the\nelectronic structure and related low energy physics of the whole class of\ncorrelated metal centered organometallic molecules.\n", "  The promise of innovative applications has triggered the development of many\nmodern technologies capable of exploiting quantum effects. But in addition to\nfuture applications, such quantum technologies have already provided us with\nthe possibility of accessing quantum-mechanical scenarios that seemed\nunreachable just a few decades ago. With this spirit, in this work we show that\nmodern optomechanical setups are mature enough to implement one of the most\nelusive models in the field of open system dynamics: degenerate parametric\noscillation. The possibility of implementing it in nonlinear optical resonators\nwas the main motivation for introducing such model in the eighties, which\nrapidly became a paradigm for the study of dissipative phase transitions whose\ncorresponding spontaneously broken symmetry is discrete. However, it was found\nthat the intrinsic multimode nature of optical cavities makes it impossible to\nexperimentally study the model all the way through its phase transition. In\ncontrast, here we show that this long-awaited model can be implemented in the\nmotion of a mechanical object dispersively coupled to the light contained in a\ncavity, when the latter is properly driven with multi-chromatic laser light. We\nfocus on membranes as the mechanical element, showing that the main signatures\nof the degenerate parametric oscillation model can be studied in\nstate-of-the-art setups, thus opening the possibility of studying spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and enhanced metrology in one of the cleanest dissipative\nphase transitions.\n", "  We generalize ERA method of PSF correction for more realistic situations. The\nmethod re-smears the observed galaxy image(galaxy image smeared by PSF) and PSF\nimage by an appropriate function called Re-Smearing Function(RSF) to make new\nimages which have the same ellipticity with the lensed (before smeared by PSF)\ngalaxy image. It has been shown that the method avoids a systematic error\narising from an approximation in the usual PSF correction in moment method such\nas KSB for simple PSF shape. By adopting an idealized PSF we generalize ERA\nmethod applicable for arbitrary PSF. This is confirmed with simulated complex\nPSF shapes. We also consider the effect of pixel noise and found that the\neffect causes systematic overestimation.\n", "  We present high-dispersion spectroscopic data of the compact planetary nebula\nVy 1-2, where high expansion velocities up to 100 km/s are found in the Ha, [N\nII] and [O III] emission lines. HST images reveal a bipolar structure. Vy 1-2\ndisplays a bright ring-like structure with a size of 2.4\"x3.2\" and two faint\nbipolar lobes in the west-east direction. A faint pair of knots is also found,\nlocated almost symmetrically on opposite sides of the nebula at PA=305 degrees.\nFurthermore, deep low-dispersion spectra are also presented and several\nemission lines are detected for the first time in this nebula, such as the\ndoublet [Cl III] 5517, 5537 A, [K IV] 6101 A, C II 6461 A, the doublet C IV\n5801, 5812 A. By comparison with the solar abundances, we find enhanced N,\ndepleted C and solar O. The central star must have experienced the hot bottom\nburning (CN-cycle) during the 2nd dredge-up phase, implying a progenitor star\nof higher than 3 solar masses. The very low C/O and N/O abundance ratios\nsuggest a likely post-common envelope close binary system.\n  A simple spherically symmetric geometry with either a blackbody or a\nH-deficient stellar atmosphere model is not able to reproduce the ionisation\nstructure of Vy 1-2. The effective temperature and luminosity of its central\nstar indicate a young nebula located at a distance of ~9.7 kpc with an age of\n~3500 years. The detection of stellar emission lines, C II 6461 A, the doublet\nC IV {\\lambda}{\\lambda} 5801, 5812 A and O III 5592 A, emitted from a\nH-deficient star, indicates the presence of a late-type Wolf-Rayet or a WEL\ntype central star.\n", "  Coalescing binaries of neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BH) are one of the\nmost important sources of gravitational waves for the upcoming network of\nground based detectors. Detection and extraction of astrophysical information\nfrom gravitational-wave signals requires accurate waveform models. The\nEffective-One-Body and other phenomenological models interpolate between\nanalytic results and $10-30$ orbit numerical relativity (NR) merger\nsimulations. In this paper we study the accuracy of these models using new NR\nsimulations that span $36-88$ orbits, with mass-ratios and black hole spins\n$(q,\\chi_{BH}) = (7, \\pm 0.4), (7, \\pm 0.6)$, and $(5, -0.9)$. We find that:\n(i) the recently published SEOBNRv1 and SEOBNRv2 models of the\nEffective-One-Body family disagree with each other (mismatches of a few\npercent) for black hole spins $\\geq 0.5$ or $\\leq -0.3$, with waveform mismatch\naccumulating during early inspiral; (ii) comparison with numerical waveforms\nindicate that this disagreement is due to phasing errors of SEOBNRv1, with\nSEOBNRv2 in good agreement with all of our simulations; (iii) Phenomenological\nwaveforms disagree with SEOBNRv2 over most of the NSBH binary parameter space;\n(iv) comparison with NR waveforms shows that most of the model's dephasing\naccumulates near the frequency interval where it switches to a phenomenological\nphasing prescription; and finally (v) both SEOBNR and post-Newtonian (PN)\nmodels are effectual for NSBH systems, but PN waveforms will give a significant\nbias in parameter recovery. Our results suggest that future gravitational-wave\ndetection searches and parameter estimation efforts targeted at NSBH systems\nwith $q\\lesssim 7$ and $\\chi_\\mathrm{BH} \\approx [-0.9, +0.6]$ will benefit\nfrom using SEOBNRv2 templates. For larger black hole spins and/or binary\nmass-ratios, we recommend the models be further investigated as suitable NR\nsimulations become available.\n", "  In this article we propose a dynamic approach to complex vector\nreconstruction in the context of quantum tomography. There are two underlying\nassumptions behind our reasoning. The first one claims that the evolution of a\nd-level pure quantum system is given by the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a\ntime-independent Hamiltonian and the other states that the knowledge about the\nquantum state is provided from projective measurements, also called intensity\nmeasurements. The problem of quantum state reconstruction is connected with the\nnotion known as phase retrieval -- recovering a complex vector from modulus of\ninner product with frame vectors. Phase retrieval is widely studied in many\nareas of science but still there is a number of problems that remain to be\nanswered. We believe that the dynamic approach can significantly improve the\neffectiveness of the vector reconstruction as it aims to decrease the number of\ndistinct projectors by taking advantage of the knowledge about the evolution.\nGeneral conditions and observations are applied to a specific unitary evolution\nmodel.\n", "  The OPERA experiment was designed to search for $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow\n\\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillations in appearance mode, i.e. by detecting the\n$\\tau$-leptons produced in charged current $\\nu_{\\tau}$ interactions. The\nexperiment took data from 2008 to 2012 in the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso\nbeam. The observation of $\\nu_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau}$ appearance,\nachieved with four candidate events in a sub-sample of the data, was previously\nreported. In this paper, a fifth $\\nu_{\\tau}$ candidate event, found in an\nenlarged data sample, is described. Together with a further reduction of the\nexpected background, the candidate events detected so far allow assessing the\ndiscovery of $\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillations in appearance mode\nwith a significance larger than 5 $\\sigma$.\n", "  High-throughput experimental techniques and bioinformatics tools make it\npossible to obtain reconstructions of the metabolism of microbial species.\nCombined with mathematical frameworks such as flux balance analysis, which\nassumes that nutrients are used so as to maximize growth, these reconstructions\nenable us to predict microbial growth.\n  Although such predictions are generally accurate, these approaches do not\ngive insights on how different nutrients are used to produce growth, and thus\nare difficult to generalize to new media or to different organisms.\n  Here, we propose a systems-level phenomenological model of metabolism\ninspired by the virial expansion. Our model predicts biomass production given\nthe nutrient uptakes and a reduced set of parameters, which can be easily\ndetermined experimentally. To validate our model, we test it against in silico\nsimulations and experimental measurements of growth, and find good agreement.\nFrom a biological point of view, our model uncovers the impact that individual\nnutrients and the synergistic interaction between nutrient pairs have on\ngrowth, and suggests that we can understand the growth maximization principle\nas the optimization of nutrient synergies.\n", "  We have developed an all-optical method for measuring the lifetimes of $n S$\nand $n D$ Rydberg states and demonstrate its capabilities with measurements on\na dilute cloud of ultracold ${}^{87}$Rb atoms in a cryogenic environment. The\nmethod is based on the time-resolved observation of resonant light absorption\nby ground state atoms and selective transfer of Rydberg atoms into the ground\nstate at varying delay times in order to reconstruct Rydberg decay curves. Our\nmeasurements of the ${}^{87}$Rb $30S_{1/2}$ state indicate an increase of the\nlifetime at lowered environment temperatures, as expected due to decreased\nblack body radiation. For the $38D_{5/2}$ state with an attractive\ndipole-dipole interaction, ionization and lifetime reduction due to collisional\neffects are observed.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional homogeneous ensemble of cold bosonic atoms\nloaded inside two optical cavities and pumped by a far-detuned external laser\nfield. We examine the conditions for these atoms to self-organize into\ntriangular and honeycomb lattices as a result of superradiance. By collectively\nscattering the pump photons, the atoms feed the initially empty cavity modes.\nAs a result, the superposition of the pump and cavity fields creates a\nspace-periodic light-shift external potential and atoms self-organize into the\npotential wells of this optical lattice. Depending on the phase of the cavity\nfields with respect to the pump laser, these minima can either form a\ntriangular or a hexagonal lattice. By numerically solving the dynamical\nequations of the coupled atom-cavity system, we have shown that the two stable\natomic structures at long times are the triangular lattice and the honeycomb\nlattice with equally-populated sites. We have also studied how to drive atoms\nfrom one lattice structure to another by dynamically changing the phase of the\ncavity fields with respect to the pump laser.\n", "  Evolution of the ESR absorption in a strong-leg spin ladder magnet\n(C$_7$H$_{10}$N$_2$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ (abbreviated as DIMPY) is studied from 300K to\n400mK. Temperature dependence of the ESR relaxation follows a staircase of\ncrossovers between different relaxation regimes. We ague that the main\nmechanism of ESR line broadening in DIMPY is uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moria\ninteraction ($|\\vec{D}|=0.20$K) with an effective longitudinal component along\nan exchange bond of Cu ions within the legs resulting from the low crystal\nsymmetry of DIMPY and nontrivial orbital ordering. The same\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in the lifting of the triplet\nexcitation degeneracy, revealed through the weak splitting of the ESR\nabsorption at low temperatures.\n", "  We present spin transport studies on bi- and trilayer graphene non-local\nspin-valves which have been fabricated by a bottom-up fabrication method. By\nthis technique, spin injection electrodes are first deposited onto\nSi$^{++}$/SiO$_2$ substrates with subsequent mechanical transfer of a\ngraphene/hBN heterostructure. We showed previously that this technique allows\nfor nanosecond spin lifetimes at room temperature combined with carrier\nmobilities which exceed 20,000 cm$^2$/(Vs). Despite strongly enhanced spin and\ncharge transport properties, the MgO injection barriers in these devices\nexhibit conducting pinholes which still limit the measured spin lifetimes. We\ndemonstrate that these pinholes can be partially diminished by an oxygen\ntreatment of a trilayer graphene device which is seen by a strong increase of\nthe contact resistance area products of the Co/MgO electrodes. At the same\ntime, the spin lifetime increases from 1 ns to 2 ns. We believe that the\npinholes partially result from the directional growth in molecular beam\nepitaxy. For a second set of devices, we therefore used atomic layer deposition\nof Al$_2$O$_3$ which offers the possibility to isotropically deposit more\nhomogeneous barriers. While the contacts of the as-fabricated bilayer graphene\ndevices are non-conductive, we can partially break the oxide barriers by\nvoltage pulses. Thereafter, the devices also exhibit nanosecond spin lifetimes.\n", "  Since 1970's, gedanken experiments have been devised to challenge the weak\ncosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), which is the expectation that spacetime\nsingularities will be hidden from faraway observers by event horizons so that\nclassical predictability in a spacetime is preserved. These experiments involve\nthe interaction of an extremal or a slightly sub-extremal black hole with a\ntest particle or field, attempting to destroy the horizon, i.e. to create a\nso-called naked singularity. They usually conclude that WCCC cannot be violated\nstarting from an extremal black hole, but may be violated starting from a\nslightly sub-extremal one, if backreaction and self-force effects are\nneglected. Some other works also analyze these effects.\n  Starting 2007, a string of papers argue if WCCC can be violated by\nclassically forbidden interactions occuring via the quantum nature of the\nparticles associated with the fields; and where backrection and/or\nsuperradiance are pointed out as effects working in the direction of preserving\nthe WCCC. We correct/modify a backrection argument, and furthermore point out\nthat superradiance does not prevent {\\em single particles} from being captured\nby the black hole; even if this capture would lead to WCCC violation.\n  Then we consider the spontaneous emission (which we call the Zel'dovich-Unruh\neffect) of particles by the black hole, and find that at least for scalars, it\ncan be understood without second quantization. It also completely invalidates\nthe mentioned single- or few-particle thought experiments. However, the\nconclusions of our previous work on (at least) scalar fields interacting with\nblack holes, i.e. that WCCC may be violated starting from slightly subextremal\nblack holes, remains valid in this (semi)classical framework.\n", "  Experimental evidence from both spin-valve and quantum transport measurements\npoints towards unexpectedly fast spin relaxation in graphene. We report\nmagnetotransport studies of epitaxial graphene on SiC in a vector magnetic\nfield showing that spin relaxation, detected using weak-localisation analysis,\nis suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field, $B_{\\parallel}$, and thereby\nproving that it is caused at least in part by spinful scatterers. A\nnon-monotonic dependence of effective decoherence rate on $B_{\\parallel}$\nreveals the intricate role of scatterers' spin dynamics in forming the\ninterference correction to conductivity, an effect that has gone unnoticed in\nearlier weak localisation studies\n", "  Hyperfine structure $A$ and $B$ factors of the atomic $5s\\,5p\\,\\; ^3\\rm{P}_2\n\\rightarrow 5s\\,6s\\,\\; ^3\\rm{S}_1$ transition are determined from collinear\nlaser spectroscopy data of $^{107-123}$Cd and $^{111m-123m}$Cd. Nuclear\nmagnetic moments and electric quadrupole moments are extracted using reference\ndipole moments and calculated electric field gradients, respectively. The\nhyperfine structure anomaly for isotopes with $s_{1/2}$ and $d_{5/2}$ nuclear\nground states and isomeric $h_{11/2}$ states is evaluated and a linear\nrelationship is observed for all nuclear states except $s_{1/2}$. This\ncorresponds to the Moskowitz-Lombardi rule that was established in the mercury\nregion of the nuclear chart but in the case of cadmium the slope is\ndistinctively smaller than for mercury. In total four atomic and ionic levels\nwere analyzed and all of them exhibit a similar behaviour. The electric field\ngradient for the atomic $5s\\,5p\\,\\; ^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ level is derived from\nmulti-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock calculations in order to evaluate the\nspectroscopic nuclear quadrupole moments. The results are consistent with those\nobtained in an ionic transition and based on a similar calculation.\n", "  We present a search for ten baryon-number violating decay modes of $\\Lambda$\nhyperons using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Laboratory. Nine of these decay\nmodes result in a single meson and single lepton in the final state ($\\Lambda\n\\rightarrow m \\ell$) and conserve either the sum or the difference of baryon\nand lepton number ($B \\pm L$). The tenth decay mode ($\\Lambda \\rightarrow\n\\bar{p}\\pi^+$) represents a difference in baryon number of two units and no\ndifference in lepton number. We observe no significant signal and set upper\nlimits on the branching fractions of these reactions in the range\n$(4-200)\\times 10^{-7}$ at the $90\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  Results from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have recently provided\ncompelling evidence for the existence of a high energy astrophysical neutrino\nflux utilizing a dominantly Southern Hemisphere dataset consisting primarily of\nnu_e and nu_tau charged current and neutral current (cascade) neutrino\ninteractions. In the analysis presented here, a data sample of approximately\n35,000 muon neutrinos from the Northern sky was extracted from data taken\nduring 659.5 days of livetime recorded between May 2010 and May 2012. While\nthis sample is composed primarily of neutrinos produced by cosmic ray\ninteractions in the Earth's atmosphere, the highest energy events are\ninconsistent with a hypothesis of solely terrestrial origin at 3.7 sigma\nsignificance. These neutrinos can, however, be explained by an astrophysical\nflux per neutrino flavor at a level of Phi(E_nu) = 9.9^{+3.9}_{-3.4} times\n10^{-19} GeV^{-1} cm^{-2} sr^{-1} s^{-1} ({E_nu / 100 TeV})^{-2}, consistent\nwith IceCube's Southern Hemisphere dominated result. Additionally, a fit for an\nastrophysical flux with an arbitrary spectral index was performed. We find a\nspectral index of 2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}, which is also in good agreement with the\nSouthern Hemisphere result.\n", "  We used a new generation of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar models that\ninclude dust formation in the stellar winds to find the links between\nevolutionary models and the observed properties of a homogeneous sample of\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) planetary nebulae (PNe). Comparison between the\nevolutionary yields of elements such as CNO and the corresponding observed\nchemical abundances is a powerful tool to shed light on evolutionary processes\nsuch as hot bottom burning (HBB) and third dredge-up (TDU). We found that the\noccurrence of HBB is needed to interpret the nitrogen-enriched (log(N/H)+12>8)\nPNe. In particular, N-rich PNe with the lowest carbon content are nicely\nreproduced by AGB models of mass M >=6 Mo, whose surface chemistry reflects the\npure effects of HBB. PNe with log(N/H)+12<7.5 correspond to ejecta of stars\nthat have not experienced HBB, with initial mass below about 3 Mo. Some of\nthese stars show very large carbon abundances, owing to the many TDU episodes\nexperienced. We found from our LMC PN sample that there is a threshold to the\namount of carbon accumulated at AGB surfaces, log(C/H)+12<9. Confirmation of\nthis constraint would indicate that, after the C-star stage is reached,AGBs\nexperience only a few thermal pulses, which suggests a rapid loss of the\nexternal mantle, probably owing to the effects of radiation pressure on\ncarbonaceous dust particles present in the circumstellar envelope. The\nimplications of these findings for AGB evolution theories and the need to\nextend the PN sample currently available are discussed.\n", "  This article presents a set of spectro-goniometric measurements of different\nwater ice samples and the comparison with an approximated radiative transfer\nmodel. The experiments were done using the spectro-radiogoniometer described in\nBrissaud et al. (2004). The radiative transfer model assumes an isotropization\nof the flux after the second interface and is fully described in Andrieu et al.\n(2015). Two kind of experiments were conducted. First, the specular spot was\nclosely investigated, at high angular resolution, at the wavelength of\n$1.5\\,\\mbox{\\mu m}$, where ice behaves as a very absorbing media. Second, the\nbidirectional reflectance was sampled at various geometries, including low\nphase angles on 61 wavelengths ranging from $0.8\\,\\mbox{\\mu m}$ to\n$2.0\\,\\mbox{\\mu m}$.\n  In order to validate the model, we made a qualitative test to demonstrate the\nrelative isotropization of the flux. We also conducted quantitative assessments\nby using a bayesian inversion method in order to estimate the parameters (e.g.\nsample thickness, surface roughness) from the radiative measurements only. A\nsimple comparison between the retrieved parameters and the direct independent\nmeasurements allowed us to validate the model.\n  We developed an innovative bayesian inversion approach to quantitatively\nestimate the uncertainties on the parameters avoiding the usual slow Monte\nCarlo approach. First we built lookup tables, and then searched the best fits\nand calculated a posteriori density probability functions. The results show\nthat the model is able to reproduce the spectral behavior of water ice slabs,\nas well as the specular spot. In addition, the different parameters of the\nmodel are compatible with independent measurements.\n", "  There has been significant recent progress in solving the long-standing\nproblems of how nuclear shell structure and collective motion emerge from\nunderlying microscopic inter-nucleon interactions. We review a selection of\nrecent significant results within the ab initio No Core Shell Model (NCSM)\nclosely tied to three major factors enabling this progress: (1) improved\nnuclear interactions that accurately describe the experimental two-nucleon and\nthree-nucleon interaction data; (2) advances in algorithms to simulate the\nquantum many-body problem with strong interactions; and (3) continued rapid\ndevelopment of high-performance computers now capable of performing $20 \\times\n10^{15}$ floating point operations per second. We also comment on prospects for\nfurther developments.\n", "  The aim here is to address the origins of sustainability for the real growth\nrate in the United States. For over a century of observations on the real GDP\nper capita of the United States a sustainable two percent growth rate has been\nobserved. To find an explanation for this observation I consider the impact of\nutility preferences and the effect of mobility of labor \\& capital on every\nprovided measurement. Mobility of labor results in heterogenous rates of\nincrease in prices which is called Baumol's cost disease phenomenon.\nHeterogeneous rates of inflation then make it impossible to define an invariant\nmeasure for the real growth rate. Paradoxical and ambiguous results already\nhave been observed when different measurements provided by the World Bank have\nbeen compared with the ones from the systems of national accounts (SNA). Such\nambiguity is currently being discussed in economy. I define a toy model for\ncaring out measurements in order to state that this ambiguity can be very\nsignificant. I provide examples in which GDP expands 5 folds while measurements\npercept an expansion around 2 folds. Violation of invariance of the\nmeasurements leads to state that it is hard to compare the growth rate of GDP\nfor a smooth growing country such as the U.S. with a fast growing country such\nas China. Besides, I state that to extrapolate the time that economy of China\npasses the economy of the US we need to consider local metric of the central\nbanks of both countries. Finally I conclude that it is our method of\nmeasurements that leads us to percept the sustainable growth rate.\n", "  This work presents a direct measurement of the $^{96}$Ru($p,\n\\gamma$)$^{97}$Rh cross section via a novel technique using a storage ring,\nwhich opens opportunities for reaction measurements on unstable nuclei. A\nproof-of-principle experiment was performed at the storage ring ESR at GSI in\nDarmstadt, where circulating $^{96}$Ru ions interacted repeatedly with a\nhydrogen target. The $^{96}$Ru($p, \\gamma$)$^{97}$Rh cross section between 9\nand 11 MeV has been determined using two independent normalization methods. As\nkey ingredients in Hauser-Feshbach calculations, the $\\gamma$-ray strength\nfunction as well as the level density model can be pinned down with the\nmeasured ($p, \\gamma$) cross section. Furthermore, the proton optical potential\ncan be optimized after the uncertainties from the $\\gamma$-ray strength\nfunction and the level density have been removed. As a result, a constrained\n$^{96}$Ru($p, \\gamma$)$^{97}$Rh reaction rate over a wide temperature range is\nrecommended for $p$-process network calculations.\n", "  We present estimates of the basic physical properties -- including size and\nalbedo -- of the extreme Centaur 2013 AZ60. These properties have been derived\nfrom optical and thermal infrared measurements. Our optical measurements\nrevealed a likely full period of ~9.4 h with a shallow amplitude of 4.5%. By\ncombining optical brightness information and thermal emission data, we are able\nto derive a diameter of 62.3 +/- 5.3 km and a geometric albedo of 2.9% --\ncorresponding to an extremely dark surface. Additionally, our finding of ~> 50\nJm^{-2}K^{-1}s^{-1/2} for the thermal inertia is also noticeably for objects in\nsuch a distance. The results of dynamical simulations yield an unstable orbit,\nwith a 50% probability that the target will be ejected from the Solar System\nwithin 700,000 years. The current orbit of this object as well as its\ninstability could imply a pristine cometary surface. This possibility is in\nagreement with the observed low geometric albedo and red photometric colour\nindices for the object, which are a good match for the surface of a dormant\ncomet -- as would be expected for a long-period cometary body approaching\nperihelion. Despite the fact it was approaching ever closer to the Sun,\nhowever, the object exhibited star-like profiles in each of our observations,\nlacking any sign of cometary activity. By the albedo, 2013 AZ60 is a candidate\nfor the darkest body among the known TNOs.\n", "  We estimate the accretion rates of 235 Classical T Tauri star (CTTS)\ncandidates in the Lagoon Nebula using $ugri$H$\\alpha$ photometry from the\nVPHAS+ survey. Our sample consists of stars displaying H$\\alpha$-excess, the\nintensity of which is used to derive accretion rates. For a subset of 87 stars,\nthe intensity of the $u$-band excess is also used to estimate accretion rates.\nWe find the mean variation in accretion rates measured using H$\\alpha$ and\n$u$-band intensities to be $\\sim$ 0.17 dex, agreeing with previous estimates\n(0.04-0.4 dex) but for a much larger sample. The spatial distribution of CTTS\nalign with the location of protostars and molecular gas suggesting that they\nretain an imprint of the natal gas fragmentation process. Strong accretors are\nconcentrated spatially, while weak accretors are more distributed. Our results\ndo not support the sequential star forming processes suggested in the\nliterature.\n", "  We measured the absolute lengths of three single crystal silicon samples by\nmeans of an imaging Twyman-Green interferometer in the temperature range from 7\nK to 293 K with uncertainties of about 1 nm. From these measurements we extract\nthe coefficient of thermal expansion with uncertainties in the order of\n$1\\times 10^{-9} {\\rm /K}$. To access the functional dependence of the length\non the temperature usually polynomials are fitted to the data. Instead we use a\nphysically motivated model equation with 7 fit parameters for the whole\ntemperature range. The coefficient of thermal expansion is obtained from the\nderivative of the best fit. The measurements conducted in 2012 and 2014\ndemonstrate a high reproducibility and the agreement of two independently\nproduced samples supports single crystal silicon as reference material for\nthermal expansion. Although the results for all three samples agree with each\nother and with measurements performed at other institutes, they significantly\ndiffer from the recommended values for thermal expansion of crystalline\nsilicon.\n", "  We investigate the properties of an impurity immersed in a dilute Bose gas at\nzero temperature using quantum Monte-Carlo methods. The interactions between\nbosons are modeled by a hard sphere potential with scattering length $a$,\nwhereas the interactions between the impurity and the bosons are modeled by a\nshort-range, square-well potential where both the sign and the strength of the\nscattering length $b$ can be varied by adjusting the well depth. We\ncharacterize the attractive and the repulsive polaron branch by calculating the\nbinding energy and the effective mass of the impurity. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate structural properties of the bath, such as the impurity-boson\ncontact parameter and the change of the density profile around the impurity. At\nthe unitary limit of the impurity-boson interaction, we find that the effective\nmass of the impurity remains smaller than twice its bare mass, while the\nbinding energy scales with $\\hbar^2n^{2/3}/m$, where $n$ is the density of the\nbath and $m$ is the common mass of the impurity and the bosons in the bath. The\nimplications for the phase diagram of binary Bose-Bose mixtures at small\nconcentrations are also discussed.\n", "  R-process nucleosynthesis models rely, by necessity, on nuclear structure\nmodels for input. Particularly important are beta-decay half-lives of neutron\nrich nuclei. At present only a single systematic calculation exists that\nprovides values for all relevant nuclei making it difficult to test the\nsensitivity of nucleosynthesis models to this input. Additionally, even though\nthere are indications that their contribution may be significant, the impact of\nfirst-forbidden transitions on decay rates has not been systematically studied\nwithin a consistent model. We use a fully self-consistent covariant density\nfunctional theory (CDFT) framework to provide a table of $\\beta$-decay\nhalf-lives and $\\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities, including\nfirst-forbidden transitions. We observe a significant contribution of the\nfirst-forbidden transitions to the total decay rate in nuclei far from the\nvalley of stability. The experimental half-lives are in general well\nreproduced, both for even-even, odd-A and odd-odd nuclei, in particular for\nshort-lived nuclei.\n", "  We have carried out an investigation of the structural, magnetic, transport\nand superconducting properties of Fe$_{1+z}$Te$_{1-x-y}$Se$_x$S$_y$ ceramic\ncompounds, for $z=0$ and some specific Se (0$\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 0.5) and S (0\n$\\leq$ y $\\leq$0.12) contents. The incorporation of Se and S to the FeTe\nstructure produces a progressive reduction of the crystallographic parameters\nas well as different degrees of structural disorder associated with the\ndifferences of the ionic radius of the substituting cations. In the present\nstudy, we measure transport properties of this family of compounds and we show\nthe direct influence of disorder in the normal and superconductor states. We\nnotice that the structural disorder correlates with a variable range hopping\nconducting regime observed at temperatures $T >$ 200 K. At lower temperatures,\nall the samples except the one with the highest degree of disorder show a\ncrossover to a metallic-like regime, probably related to the transport of\nresilient-quasi-particles associated with the proximity of a Fermi liquid state\nat temperatures below the superconducting transition. Moreover, the\nsuperconducting properties are depressed only for that particular sample, in\naccordance to the condition that superconductivity is affected by disorder when\nthe electronic localization length $\\xi_L$ becomes smaller than the coherence\nlength $\\xi_{SC}$.\n", "  (Abridged) Near- to mid-IR observations of protoplanetary disks show that the\ninner regions (<10AU) are rich in small organic volatiles (e.g., C2H2 and HCN).\nTrends in the data suggest that disks around cooler stars (~3000K) are\npotentially more carbon- and molecule-rich than their hotter counterparts. Our\naims are to explore the composition of the planet-forming region of disks\naround stars from M dwarf to Herbig Ae and compare with the observed trends.\nModels of the disk physical structure are coupled with a gas-grain chemical\nnetwork to map the abundances in the planet-forming zone. N2 self shielding,\nX-ray-induced chemistry, and initial abundances, are investigated. The\ncomposition in the 'observable' atmosphere is compared with that in the\nmidplane where the planet-building reservoir resides. M dwarf disk atmospheres\nare relatively more molecule rich than those for T Tauri or Herbig Ae disks.\nThe weak far-UV flux helps retain this complexity which is enhanced by\nX-ray-induced ion-molecule chemistry. N2 self shielding has only a small effect\nand does not explain the higher C2H2/HCN ratios observed towards cooler stars.\nThe models underproduce the OH/H2O column density ratios constrained in Herbig\nAe disks, despite reproducing the absolute value for OH: H2O self shielding\nonly increases this discrepency. The disk midplane content is sensitive to the\ninitial main elemental reservoirs. The gas in the inner disk is generally more\ncarbon rich than the midplane ices and is most significant for disks around\ncooler stars. The atmospheric C/O ratio appears larger than it actually is when\ncalculated using observable tracers only because gas-phase O2 is predicted to\nbe a significant oxygen reservoir. The models suggest that the gas in the inner\nregions of disks around cooler stars is more carbon rich; however, calculations\nof the molecular emission are necessary to confirm the observed trends.\n", "  Two-dimensional photonic crystal membranes provide a versatile planar\narchitecture for integrated photonics to control the propagation of light on a\nchip employing high quality optical cavities, waveguides, beamsplitters or\ndispersive elements. When combined with highly non-linear quantum emitters,\nquantum photonic networks operating at the single photon level come within\nreach. Towards large-scale quantum photonic networks, selective dynamic control\nof individual components and deterministic interactions between different\nconstituents are of paramount importance. This indeed calls for switching\nspeeds ultimately on the system's native timescales. For example, manipulation\nvia electric fields or all-optical means have been employed for switching in\nnanophotonic circuits and cavity quantum electrodynamics studies. Here, we\ndemonstrate dynamic control of the coherent interaction between two coupled\nphotonic crystal nanocavities forming a photonic molecule. By using an\nelectrically generated radio frequency surface acoustic wave we achieve\noptomechanical tuning, demonstrate operating speeds more than three orders of\nmagnitude faster than resonant mechanical approaches. Moreover, the tuning\nrange is large enough to compensate for the inherent fabrication-related cavity\nmode detuning. Our findings open a route towards nanomechanically gated\nprotocols, which hitherto have inhibited the realization in all-optical\nschemes.\n", "  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the strongest explosions in the Universe, which\ndue to their extreme character likely involve some of the strongest magnetic\nfields in nature. This review discusses the possible roles of magnetic fields\nin GRBs, from their central engines, through the launching, acceleration and\ncollimation of their ultra-relativistic jets, to the dissipation and particle\nacceleration that power their $\\gamma$-ray emission, and the powerful blast\nwave they drive into the surrounding medium that generates their long-lived\nafterglow emission. An emphasis is put on particular areas in which there have\nbeen interesting developments in recent years.\n", "  Galactic Center (GC) molecular cloud Sgr B2 is the best manifestation of an\nX-ray reflection nebula (XRN) reprocessing a past giant outburst from the\nsupermassive black hole Sgr A*. Alternatively, Sgr B2 could be illuminated by\nlow-energy cosmic ray electrons (LECRe) or protons (LECRp). In 2013, NuSTAR for\nthe first time resolved Sgr B2 hard X-ray emission on sub-arcminute scales. Two\nprominent features are detected above 10 keV - a newly emerging cloud\nG0.66-0.13 and the central 90\" radius region containing two compact cores Sgr\nB2(M) and Sgr B2(N) surrounded by diffuse emission. It is inconclusive whether\nthe remaining level of Sgr B2 emission is still decreasing or has reached a\nconstant background level. A decreasing Fe K$\\alpha$ emission can be best\nexplained by XRN while a constant background emission can be best explained by\nLECRp. In the XRN scenario, the 3-79 keV Sgr B2 spectrum can well constrain the\npast Sgr A* outburst, resulting in an outburst spectrum with a peak luminosity\nof $L_{3-79\\rm~keV} \\sim 5\\times10^{38} \\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ derived from the\nmaximum Compton-scattered continuum and the Fe K$\\alpha$ emission consistently.\nThe XRN scenario is preferred by the fast variability of G0.66-0.13, which\ncould be a molecular clump located in the Sgr B2 envelope reflecting the same\nSgr A* outburst. In the LECRp scenario, we derived the required CR ion power\n$dW/dt=(1-4)\\times10^{39}\\rm~erg~s^{-1}$ and the CR ionization rate\n$\\zeta_{H}=(6-10)\\times 10^{-15}\\rm~H^{-1}~s^{-1}$. The Sgr B2 background level\nX-ray emission will be a powerful tool to constrain GC CR population.\n", "  We have studied the filaments extracted from the column density maps of the\nnearby Lupus 1, 3, and 4 molecular clouds, derived from photometric maps\nobserved with the Herschel satellite. Filaments in the Lupus clouds have quite\nlow column densities, with a median value of $\\sim$1.5$\\times$10$^{21}$\ncm$^{-2}$ and most have masses per unit length lower than the maximum critical\nvalue for radial gravitational collapse. Indeed, no evidence of filament\ncontraction has been seen in the gas kinematics. We find that some filaments,\nthat on average are thermally subcritical, contain dense cores that may\neventually form stars. This is an indication that in the low column density\nregime, the critical condition for the formation of stars may be reached only\nlocally and this condition is not a global property of the filament. Finally,\nin Lupus we find multiple observational evidences of the key role that the\nmagnetic field plays in forming filaments, and determining their confinement\nand dynamical evolution.\n", "  We demonstrate that to a very good approximation the scale-evolution of the\nintrinsic heavy quark content of the nucleon is governed by non-singlet\nevolution equations. This allows us to analyze the intrinsic heavy quark\ndistributions without having to resort to a full-fledged global analysis of\nparton distribution functions. This freedom is then exploited to model\nintrinsic bottom distributions which are so far missing in the literature in\norder to estimate the impact of this non-perturbative contribution to the\nbottom-quark PDF, and on parton--parton luminosities at the LHC.\n  This technique can be applied to the case of intrinsic charm, albeit within\nthe limitations outlined in the following.\n", "  We consider the pairing between conduction band electrons, and the valence\nband holes in the neutral bilayer-type structures. By employing the bilayer\nHubbard model, we show the possibility of the inter-plane exciton formation in\nthe system without applied external field. The in-plane and inter-plane Coulomb\ninteraction effects on the pairing mechanism are considered, and the role of\nthe in-plane particle hopping asymmetry on the gap behavior is analyzed in the\npaper. We show that both Frenkel-type pairing channel and Wannier-Mott-type\nexcitonic pairings are present in the considered system. We analyze also the\nstructure of the chemical potential in the bilayer system. The temperature\neffects, and the tunable inter-plane electron hopping effects are discussed.\nFor the Frenkel channel, we have shown a particular behavior of the chemical\npotential at the very low temperatures, which is related to the degenerated\nFrenkel-gap.\n", "  We report on measurements of the sound velocity and attenuation in a single\ncrystal of the candidate quantum- spin-ice material Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ as a\nfunction of temperature and magnetic field. The acoustic modes couple to the\nspins magneto-elastically and, hence, carry information about the spin\ncorrelations that sheds light on the intricate magnetic phase diagram of\nYb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and the nature of spin dynamics in the material.\nParticularly, we find a pronounced thermal hysteresis in the acoustic data with\na concomitant peak in the specific heat indicating a possible first-order phase\ntransition at about $0.17$ K. At low temperatures, the acoustic response to\nmagnetic field saturates hinting at the development of magnetic order.\nFurthermore, mean-field calculations suggest that Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ undergoes a\nfirst-order phase transition from a cooperative paramagnetic phase to a\nferromagnet below $T\\approx 0.17$ K.\n", "  We report the results of a long-term spectroscopic monitoring of the FS\\,CMa\ntype object MWC\\,728. We found that it is a binary system with a B5 Ve (T$_{\\rm\neff}$ = 14000$\\pm$1000 K) primary and a G8 III type (T$_{\\rm eff} \\sim$ 5000 K)\nsecondary. Absorption line positions of the secondary vary with a\nsemi-amplitude of $\\sim$20 km/s and a period of 27.5 days. The system's mass\nfunction is 2.3$\\times10^{-2}$ M$_\\odot$, and its orbital plane is\n$13^{\\circ}-15^{\\circ}$ tilted from the plane of the sky. The primary's $v \\sin\ni \\sim$110 km/s combined with this tilt implies that it rotates at a nearly\nbreakup velocity. We detected strong variations of the Balmer and He I\nemission-line profiles on timescales from days to years. This points to a\nvariable stellar wind of the primary in addition to the presence of a\ncircum-primary gaseous disk. The strength of the absorption-line spectrum along\nwith the optical and near-IR continuum suggest that the primary contributes\n$\\sim$60% of the $V$--band flux, the disk contributes $\\sim$30%, and the\nsecondary $\\sim$10%. The system parameters, along with the interstellar\nextinction, suggest a distance of $\\sim$1 kpc, that the secondary does not fill\nits Roche lobe, and that the companions' mass ratio is $q \\sim$0.5. Overall,\nthe observed spectral variability and the presence of a strong IR-excess are in\nagreement with a model of a close binary system that has undergone a\nnon-conservative mass-transfer.\n", "  We report the discovery of Antlia B, a faint dwarf galaxy at a projected\ndistance of $\\sim$72 kpc from NGC 3109 ($M_{V}$$\\sim$$-$15 mag), the primary\ngalaxy of the NGC 3109 dwarf association at the edge of the Local Group. The\ntip of the red giant branch distance to Antlia B is $D$=1.29$\\pm$0.10 Mpc,\nwhich is consistent with the distance to NGC 3109. A qualitative analysis\nindicates the new dwarf's stellar population has both an old, metal poor red\ngiant branch ($\\gtrsim$10 Gyr, [Fe/H]$\\sim$$-$2), and a younger blue population\nwith an age of $\\sim$200-400 Myr, analogous to the original Antlia dwarf,\nanother likely satellite of NGC 3109. Antlia B has \\ion{H}{1} gas at a velocity\nof $v_{helio,HI}$=376 km s$^{-1}$, confirming the association with NGC 3109\n($v_{helio}$=403 km s$^{-1}$). The HI gas mass\n(M$_{HI}$=2.8$\\pm$0.2$\\times$10$^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), stellar luminosity\n($M_{V}$=$-$9.7$\\pm$0.6 mag) and half light radius ($r_{h}$=273$\\pm$29 pc) are\nall consistent with the properties of dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies in the Local Volume, and is most similar to the Leo P dwarf galaxy.\nThe discovery of Antlia B is the initial result from a Dark Energy Camera\nsurvey for halo substructure and faint dwarf companions to NGC 3109 with the\ngoal of comparing observed substructure with expectations from the\n$\\Lambda$+Cold Dark Matter model in the sub-Milky Way regime.\n", "  Low-temperature neutron diffraction and NMR studies of field-induced phases\nin linarite are presented for magnetic fields $H \\parallel b$ axis. A two-step\nspin-flop transition is observed as well as a transition transforming a helical\nmagnetic ground state into an unusual magnetic phase with sine-wave modulated\nmoments $\\parallel H$. An effective $\\tilde{J}_1$-$\\tilde{J}_2$ single-chain\nmodel with a magnetization-dependent frustration ratio $\\alpha_{\\rm eff} =\n-\\tilde{J}_2/\\tilde{J}_1$ is proposed. The latter is governed by skew\ninterchain couplings and shifted to the vicinity of the ferromagnetic critical\npoint. It explains qualitatively the observation of a rich variety of exotic\n(for strongly correlated cuprate spin-1/2 Heisenberg systems) longitudinal\ncollinear spin-density wave SDW$_p$ states ($9 \\geq p \\geq 2$).\n", "  The relative cosmic variance ($\\sigma_v$) is a fundamental source of\nuncertainty in pencil-beam surveys and, as a particular case of count-in-cell\nstatistics, can be used to estimate the bias between galaxies and their\nunderlying dark-matter distribution. Our goal is to test the significance of\nthe clustering information encoded in the $\\sigma_v$ measured in the ALHAMBRA\nsurvey. We measure the cosmic variance of several galaxy populations selected\nwith $B-$band luminosity at $0.35 \\leq z < 1.05$ as the intrinsic dispersion in\nthe number density distribution derived from the 48 ALHAMBRA subfields. We\ncompare the observational $\\sigma_v$ with the cosmic variance of the dark\nmatter expected from the theory, $\\sigma_{v,{\\rm dm}}$. This provides an\nestimation of the galaxy bias $b$. The galaxy bias from the cosmic variance is\nin excellent agreement with the bias estimated by two-point correlation\nfunction analysis in ALHAMBRA. This holds for different redshift bins, for red\nand blue subsamples, and for several $B-$band luminosity selections. We find\nthat $b$ increases with the $B-$band luminosity and the redshift, as expected\nfrom previous work. Moreover, red galaxies have a larger bias than blue\ngalaxies, with a relative bias of $b_{\\rm rel} = 1.4 \\pm 0.2$. Our results\ndemonstrate that the cosmic variance measured in ALHAMBRA is due to the\nclustering of galaxies and can be used to characterise the $\\sigma_v$ affecting\npencil-beam surveys. In addition, it can also be used to estimate the galaxy\nbias $b$ from a method independent of correlation functions.\n", "  In the 50 years since the advent of X-ray astronomy there have been many\nscientific advances due to the development of new experimental techniques for\ndetecting and characterising X-rays. Observations of X-ray polarisation have,\nhowever, not undergone a similar development. This is a shortcoming since a\nplethora of open questions related to the nature of X-ray sources could be\nresolved through measurements of the linear polarisation of emitted X-rays. The\nPoGOLite Pathfinder is a balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimeter operating in the\n25 - 240 keV energy band from a stabilised observation platform. Polarisation\nis determined using coincident energy deposits in a segmented array of plastic\nscintillators surrounded by a BGO anticoincidence system and a polyethylene\nneutron shield. The PoGOLite Pathfinder was launched from the SSC Esrange Space\nCentre in July 2013. A near-circumpolar flight was achieved with a duration of\napproximately two weeks. The flight performance of the Pathfinder design is\ndiscussed for the three Crab observations conducted. The signal-to-background\nratio for the observations is shown to be 0.25$\\pm$0.03 and the Minimum\nDetectable Polarisation (99% C.L.) is (28.4$\\pm$2.2)%. A strategy for the\ncontinuation of the PoGOLite programme is outlined based on experience gained\nduring the 2013 maiden flight.\n", "  The solar photospheric oxygen abundance is still widely debated. Adopting the\nsolar chemical composition based on the \"low\" oxygen abundance, as determined\nwith the use of three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical model atmospheres,\nresults in a well-known mismatch between theoretical solar models and\nhelioseismic measurements that is so far unresolved. We carry out an\nindependent redetermination of the solar oxygen abundance by investigating the\ncenter-to-limb variation of the OI IR triplet lines at 777 nm in different sets\nof spectra with the help of detailed synthetic line profiles based on 3D\nhydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmospheres and 3D non-LTE line formation\ncalculations with NLTETD. The idea is to simultaneously derive the oxygen\nabundance,A(O), and the scaling factor SH that describes the cross-sections for\ninelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen relative the classical Drawin\nformula. The best fit of the center-to-limb variation of the triplet lines\nachieved with the CO5BOLD 3D solar model is clearly of superior quality\ncompared to the line profile fits obtained with standard 1D model atmospheres.\nOur best estimate of the 3D non-LTE solar oxygen abundance is A(O) = 8.76 +/-\n0.02, with the scaling factor SH in the range between 1.2 and 1.8. All 1D\nnon-LTE models give much lower oxygen abundances, by up to -0.15 dex. This is\nmainly a consequence of the assumption of a $\\mu$-independent microturbulence.\n", "  QCD resummation predictions for the production of new charged ($W'$) and\nneutral ($Z'$) heavy gauge bosons decaying leptonically are presented. These\nresults are obtained with our resummation code at next-to-leading order and\nnext-to-leading logarithmic (NLO+NLL) accuracy. Our predictions are compared to\nPYTHIA at leading order (LO) supplemented with parton showers (PS) and FEWZ at\nNLO and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) for the $p_T$-differential and\ntotal cross sections in the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) and general\nSU(2)$\\times$SU(2)$\\times$U(1) models. We show that the importance of\nresummation for total cross sections increases with the gauge boson mass.\nFinally, the latest ATLAS and CMS results are reinterpreted to derive new\nlimits at NLO+NLL on $W'$ and $Z'$ boson masses in general extensions of the\nStandard Model.\n", "  The questions about the origin and type of cosmic particles are not only\nfascinating for scientists in astrophysics, but also for young enthusiastic\nhigh school students. To familiarize them with research in astroparticle\nphysics, the Pierre Auger Collaboration agreed to make 1% of its data publicly\navailable. The Pierre Auger Observatory investigates cosmic rays at the highest\nenergies and consists of more than 1600 water Cherenkov detectors, located near\nMalarg\\\"{u}e, Argentina. With publicly available data from the experiment,\nstudents can perform their own hands-on analysis. In the framework of a\nso-called Astroparticle Masterclass organized alongside the context of the\nGerman outreach network Netzwerk Teilchenwelt, students get a valuable insight\ninto cosmic ray physics and scientific research concepts. We present the\nproject and experiences with students.\n", "  We conduct a pilot investigation to determine the optimal combination of\ncolor and variability information to identify quasars in current and future\nmulti-epoch optical surveys. We use a Bayesian quasar selection algorithm\n(Richards et al. 2004) to identify 35,820 type 1 quasar candidates in a 239\nsquare degree field of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, using a\ncombination of optical photometry and variability. Color analysis is performed\non 5-band single- and multi-epoch SDSS optical photometry to a depth of r\n~22.4. From these data, variability parameters are calculated by fitting the\nstructure function of each object in each band with a power law model using 10\nto >100 observations over timescales from ~1 day to ~8 years. Selection was\nbased on a training sample of 13,221 spectroscopically-confirmed type-1\nquasars, largely from the SDSS. Using variability alone, colors alone, and\ncombining variability and colors we achieve 91%, 93%, and 97% quasar\ncompleteness and 98%, 98%, and 97% efficiency respectively, with particular\nimprovement in the selection of quasars at 2.7<z<3.5 where quasars and stars\nhave similar optical colors. The 22,867 quasar candidates that are not\nspectroscopically confirmed reach a depth of i ~22.0; 21,876 (95.7%) are dimmer\nthan coadded i-band magnitude of 19.9, the cut off for spectroscopic follow-up\nfor SDSS on Stripe 82. Brighter than 19.9, we find 5.7% more quasar candidates\nwithout confirming spectra in sky regions otherwise considered complete. The\nresulting quasar sample has sufficient purity (and statistically correctable\nincompleteness) to produce a luminosity function comparable to those determined\nby spectroscopic investigations. We discuss improvements that can be made to\nthe process in preparation for performing similar photometric selection and\nscience on data from post-SDSS sky surveys.\n", "  We propose a model for the quark-antiquark interaction in Minkowski space\nusing the Covariant Spectator Theory. We show that with an equal-weighted\nscalar-pseudoscalar structure for the confining part of our interaction kernel\nthe axial-vector Ward-Takahashi identity is preserved and our model complies\nwith the Adler-zero constraint for pi-pi-scattering imposed by chiral symmetry.\n", "  The stability of $\\nu=1/3$ Fractional Chern Insulator (FCI) phase is analysed\non the example of checkerboard lattice undergoing a transition into Lieb\nlattice. The transition is performed by the addition of a second sublattice,\nwhose coupling to the checkerboard sites is controlled by sublattice staggered\npotential. We investigate the influence of these sites on the many body energy\ngap between three lowest energy states and the fourth state. We consider cases\nwith different complex phases acquired in hopping and a model with a flattened\ntopologically nontrivial band. We find that an interaction with the additional\nsites either open the single-particle gap or enlarge the existing one, which\ntranslates into similar effect on the many-particle gap. Evidences of FCI phase\nfor a region in a parameter space with larger energy gap are shown by looking\nat momenta of the three-fold degenerate ground state, spectral flow, and\nquasihole excitation spectrum.\n", "  The morphology of the circumnuclear gas accreting onto supermassive black\nholes in Seyfert galaxies remains a topic of much debate. As the innermost\nregions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are spatially unresolved, X-ray\nspectroscopy, and in particular line-of-sight absorption variability, is a key\ndiagnostic to map out the distribution of gas. Observations of variable X-ray\nabsorption in multiple Seyferts and over a wide range of timescales indicate\nthe presence of clumps/clouds of gas within the circumnuclear material. Eclipse\nevents by clumps transiting the line of sight allow us to explore the\nproperties of the clumps over a wide range of radial distances from the\noptical/UV Broad Line Region (BLR) to beyond the dust sublimation radius.\nTime-resolved absorption events have been extremely rare so far, but suggest a\nrange of density profiles across Seyferts. We resolve a weeks-long absorption\nevent in the Seyfert NGC 3227. We examine six Suzaku and twelve Swift\nobservations from a 2008 campaign spanning 5 weeks. We use a model accounting\nfor the complex spectral interplay of three differently-ionized absorbers. We\nperform time-resolved spectroscopy to discern the absorption variability\nbehavior. We also examine the IR-to-X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) to\ntest for reddening by dust. The 2008 absorption event is due to\nmoderately-ionized ($\\log \\xi\\sim 1.2-1.4$) gas covering 90% of the line of\nsight. We resolve the density profile to be highly irregular, in contrast to a\nprevious symmetric and centrally-peaked event mapped with RXTE in the same\nobject. The UV data do not show significant reddening, suggesting that the\ncloud is dust-free. The 2008 campaign has revealed a transit by a filamentary,\nmoderately-ionized cloud of variable density that is likely located in the BLR,\nand possibly part of a disk wind.\n", "  Using a sample of 425 nearby Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) from von der\nLinden et al. (2007), we study the relationship between their internal\nproperties (stellar masses, structural parameters and morphologies) and their\nenvironment. More massive BCGs tend to inhabit denser regions and more massive\nclusters than lower mass BCGs. Furthermore, cDs, which are BCGs with\nparticularly extended envelopes, seem to prefer marginally denser regions and\ntend to be hosted by more massive halos than elliptical BCGs. cD and elliptical\nBCGs show parallel positive correlations between their stellar masses and\nenvironmental densities. However, at a fixed environmental density, cDs are, on\naverage, ~40% more massive. Our results, together with the findings of previous\nstudies, suggest an evolutionary link between elliptical and cD BCGs. We\nsuggest that most present-day cDs started their life as ellipticals, which\nsubsequently grew in stellar mass and size due to mergers. In this process, the\ncD envelope developed. The large scatter in the stellar masses and sizes of the\ncDs reflects their different merger histories. The growth of the BCGs in mass\nand size seems to be linked to the hierarchical growth of the structures they\ninhabit: as the groups and clusters became denser and more massive, the BCGs at\ntheir centres also grew. This process is nearing completion since the majority\n(~60%) of the BCGs in the local Universe have cD morphology. However, the\npresence of galaxies with intermediate morphological classes (between\nellipticals and cDs) suggests that the growth and morphological transformation\nof some BCGs is still ongoing.\n", "  Unidirectional transports have been observed in two-dimensional systems,\nhowever, so far they have not been experimentally observed in three-dimensional\nbulk materials. In this theoretical work we show that the recently discovered\nWeyl materials provide a platform for unidirectional transports inside bulk\nmaterials. With high experimental feasibility, a complex Dirac mass can be\ngenerated and manipulated in the photonic Weyl crystals, creating\nunidirectionally propagating modes observable in transmission experiments.\nPossible realization in (electronic) Weyl semimetals is also studied. We show\nin a lattice model that, with a short-range interaction, the desired form of\nthe Dirac mass can be spontaneously generated in a first-order transition.\n", "  Photometric and spectroscopic observations of five nearly parabolic comets\nwith eccentricity larger than 0.99 at heliocentric distances greater than 4 AU\nwere performed. No molecular emission was observed for any studied comet and\nthe entire cometary activity in all cases was attributed to dust production.\nUpper limits of the gas production rates for the main neutral molecules in the\ncometary comae were calculated. The derived values of dust apparent magnitudes\nwere used to estimate the upper limit of the geometric cross-section of\ncometary nuclei (upper limits of radii range from 2 km to 28 km). Due to the\npoor sublimation of water ice at these distances from the Sun, other mechanisms\ntriggering activity in comets are discussed.\n", "  We present a sample of 22 blue ($(B-V)_{AB}<0.45$), luminous\n($M_{B,AB}<-18.9$), metal-poor galaxies in the $0.69<z<0.88$ redshift range,\nselected from the DEEP2 galaxy redshift survey. Their spectra contain the\n$[OIII]\\lambda4363$ auroral line, the $[OII]\\lambda \\lambda3726,3729$ doublet\nand the strong nebular $[OIII]\\lambda \\lambda 4959,5007$ emission lines. The\nionised gas-phase oxygen abundances of these galaxies lie between $7.62<12+\\log\nO/H < 8.19$, i.e. between $1/10 Z_{\\odot}$ and $1/3 Z_{\\odot}$. We find that\ngalaxies in our sample have comparable metallicities to other\nintermediate-redshift samples, but are more metal poor than local systems of\nsimilar B-band luminosities and star formation activity. The galaxies here show\nsimilar properties to the \"green peas\" discovered at $z\\simeq 0.2 - 0.3$ though\nour galaxies tend to be slightly less luminous.\n", "  SNO+ is a large liquid scintillator-based experiment located 2km underground\nat SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. It reuses the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory\ndetector, consisting of a 12m diameter acrylic vessel which will be filled with\nabout 780 tonnes of ultra-pure liquid scintillator. Designed as a multipurpose\nneutrino experiment, the primary goal of SNO+ is a search for the neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$) of 130Te. In Phase I, the detector will be\nloaded with 0.3% natural tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800 kg of 130Te,\nwith an expected effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of\n55-133 meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy. Recently, the possibility\nof deploying up to ten times more natural tellurium has been investigated,\nwhich would enable SNO+ to achieve sensitivity deep into the parameter space\nfor the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy in the future. Additionally, SNO+ aims\nto measure reactor antineutrino oscillations, low-energy solar neutrinos, and\ngeoneutrinos, to be sensitive to supernova neutrinos, and to search for exotic\nphysics. A first phase with the detector filled with water will begin soon,\nwith the scintillator phase expected to start after a few months of water data\ntaking. The 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ Phase I is foreseen for 2017.\n", "  We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ka band (33 GHz) and Atacama\nLarge Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 (94.5 GHz) continuum images covering the\nnucleus and two extranuclear star-forming regions within the nearby galaxy NGC\n3627 (M 66), observed as part of the Star Formation in Radio Survey (SFRS).\nBoth images achieve an angular resolution of $\\lesssim$2\\arcsec, allowing us to\nmap the radio spectral indices and estimate thermal radio fractions at a linear\nresolution of $\\lesssim$90 pc at the distance of NGC 3627. The thermal fraction\nat 33 GHz reaches unity at and around the peaks of each HII region; we\nadditionally observed the spectral index between 33 and 94.5 GHz to become both\nincreasingly negative and positive away from the peaks of the HII regions,\nindicating an increase of non-thermal extended emission from diffusing\ncosmic-ray electrons and the possible presence of cold dust, respectively.\nWhile the ALMA observations were optimized for collecting continuum data, they\nalso detected line emission from the $J=1\\rightarrow0$ transitions of HCN and\nHCO$^{+}$. The peaks of dense molecular gas traced by these two spectral lines\nare spatially offset from the peaks of the 33 and 94.5 GHz continuum emission\nfor the case of the extranuclear star-forming regions, indicating that our data\nreach an angular resolution at which one can spatially distinguish sites of\nrecent star formation from the sites of future star formation. Finally, we find\ntrends of decreasing dense gas fraction and velocity dispersion with increasing\nstar formation efficiency among the three regions observed, indicating that the\ndynamical state of the dense gas, rather than its abundance, plays a more\nsignificant role in the star formation process.\n", "  An effective field theory for infalling observers in the vicinity of a\nquasi-static black hole is given in terms of a freely falling lattice\ndiscretization. The lattice model successfully reproduces the thermal spectrum\nof outgoing Hawking radiation, as was shown by Corley and Jacobson, but can\nalso be used to model observations made by a typical low-energy observer who\nenters the black hole in free fall at a prescribed time. The explicit short\ndistance cutoff ensures that, from the viewpoint of the infalling observer, any\nquantum information that entered the black hole more than a scrambling time\nearlier has been erased by the black hole singularity. This property, combined\nwith the requirement that outside observers need at least of order the\nscrambling time to extract quantum information from the black hole, ensures\nthat a typical infalling observer does not encounter drama upon crossing the\nblack hole horizon in a theory where black hole information is preserved for\nasymptotic observers.\n", "  We present a code to construct initial data for binary neutron star systems\nin which the stars are rotating. Our code, based on a formalism developed by\nTichy, allows for arbitrary rotation axes of the neutron stars and is able to\nachieve rotation rates near rotational breakup. We compute the neutron star\nangular momentum through quasi-local angular momentum integrals. When\nconstructing irrotational binary neutron stars, we find a very small residual\ndimensionless spin of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{-4}$. Evolutions of rotating neutron\nstar binaries show that the magnitude of the stars' angular momentum is\nconserved, and that the spin- and orbit-precession of the stars is well\ndescribed by post-Newtonian approximation. We demonstrate that orbital\neccentricity of the binary neutron stars can be controlled to $\\sim 0.1\\%$. The\nneutron stars show quasi-normal mode oscillations at an amplitude which\nincreases with the rotation rate of the stars.\n", "  The dynamics of excited electrons and holes in single layer (SL) MoS$_2$ have\nso far been difficult to disentangle from the excitons that dominate the\noptical response of this material. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy for a SL of MoS$_2$ on a metallic substrate to\ndirectly measure the excited free carriers. This allows us to ascertain a\ndirect quasiparticle band gap of 1.95 eV and determine an ultrafast (50 fs)\nextraction of excited free carriers via the metal in contact with the SL\nMoS$_2$. This process is of key importance for optoelectronic applications that\nrely on separated free carriers rather than excitons.\n", "  Quantum Hall bilayer phase diagram with respect to interlayer distance bears\na remarkable similarity with phase diagrams of strongly correlated systems as a\nfunction of doping, with magnetic ordering on the one end and Fermi-liquid-like\nbehaviour on the other. Moreover, it has been suggested [PRL 101, 176803\n(2008)] that a BCS correlated state of composite fermions with p-wave pairing\nmay exist in the intermediate region. In the same region, an exact\ndiagonalization study in the torus geometry [PRB 69, 045319 (2004)] pointed out\nthe existence of state(s) with pseudospin spiraling order. Here we reconcile\nthese two descriptions of the intermediate state by considering the underlying\nbosonic representation of the composite fermion paired state in the long\ndistance limit, and by performing extensive exact diagonalizations on the\ntorus. We argue that the spiraling states belong to the manifold of degenerate\nground state(s), and are a consequence of Bose condensation of the\nquasiparticles (with critical algebraic correlations) at non-zero momenta in\nthe two pseudospin states. The spiraling states, generated in this way as\nspin-textures, can be identified with meron-antimeron constructions. Thus,\nmerons -- the fractionally charged vortex excitations of the XY magnetically\nordered state -- constitute some of the topological sectors. It follows that\nmerons are deconfined in the intermediate state, and allow for a smooth\ntransition between the magnetically ordered and Fermi-liquid-like phases, in\nwhich they are bound in pairs.\n", "  The combination of nonlinear and integrated photonics has recently seen a\nsurge with Kerr frequency comb generation in micro-resonators as the most\nsignificant achievement. Efficient nonlinear photonic chips have myriad\napplications including high speed optical signal processing, on-chip\nmulti-wavelength lasers, metrology, molecular spectroscopy, and quantum\ninformation science. Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) exhibits very high\nmaterial nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss when operated below half its\nbandgap energy. However, difficulties in device processing and low device\neffective nonlinearity made Kerr frequency comb generation elusive. Here, we\ndemonstrate AlGaAs-on-insulator as a nonlinear platform at telecom wavelengths.\nUsing newly developed fabrication processes, we show high-quality-factor\n(Q>100,000) micro-resonators with integrated bus waveguides in a planar circuit\nwhere optical parametric oscillation is achieved with a record low threshold\npower of 3 mW and a frequency comb spanning 350 nm is obtained. Our\ndemonstration shows the huge potential of the AlGaAs-on-insulator platform in\nintegrated nonlinear photonics.\n", "  We show how to exploit algebraic relations of operators (or matrices) which\nconstitute the non-equilibrium matrix product steady state of a boundary driven\nquantum spin chain to find partial differential equations determining all the\n$m$-point correlation functions in the continuum limit. These partial\ndifferential equations, the order of which is determined by scaling of the\nnon-equilibrium partition function, are readily solved if we also know the\nboundary conditions. In this way we can avoid resorting to representation\ntheory of the matrix product algebra. We apply our methods to study the\ndistributions, or moments, of the magnetization and the spin current\nobservables in boundary driven open XXZ spin chains, as well as some connected\ncorrelation functions and find that the transverse connected correlation\nfunctions are thermodynamically non-decaying and long-range at the isotropic\npoint $\\Delta=1$.\n", "  We reconstructed the energy and the position of the shower maximum of air\nshowers with energies $E \\gtrsim 100 $PeV applying a method using radio\nmeasurements performed with Tunka-Rex. An event-to-event comparison to\nair-Cherenkov measurements of the same air showers with the Tunka-133\nphotomultiplier array confirms that the radio reconstruction works reliably.\nThe Tunka-Rex reconstruction methods and absolute scales have been tuned on\nCoREAS simulations and yield energy and $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ values consistent\nwith the Tunka-133 measurements. The results of two independent measurement\nseasons agree within statistical uncertainties, which gives additional\nconfidence in the radio reconstruction. The energy precision of Tunka-Rex is\ncomparable to the Tunka-133 precision of $15 %$, and exhibits a $20 %$\nuncertainty on the absolute scale dominated by the amplitude calibration of the\nantennas. For $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$, this is the first direct experimental\ncorrelation of radio measurements with a different, established method. At the\nmoment, the $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ resolution of Tunka-Rex is approximately $40\n$g/cm$^2$. This resolution can probably be improved by deploying additional\nantennas and by further development of the reconstruction methods, since the\npresent analysis does not yet reveal any principle limitations.\n", "  Anomalous spectral shift of transmission peaks is observed in a\nFabry--P\\'erot cavity filled with a chiral anisotropic medium. The effective\nrefractive index value resides out of the interval between the ordinary and the\nextraordinary refractive indices. The spectral shift is explained by\ncontribution of a geometric phase. The problem is solved analytically using the\napproximate Jones matrix method, numerically using the accurate Berreman method\nand geometrically using the generalized Mauguin--Poincar\\'e rolling cone\nmethod. The $o$-mode blue shift is measured for a\n4-methoxybenzylidene-4'-$n$-butylaniline twisted--nematic layer inside the\nFabry--P\\'erot cavity. The twist is electrically induced due to the\nhomeoplanar--twisted configuration transition in an ionic-surfactant-doped\nliquid crystal layer. Experimental evidence confirms the validity of the\ntheoretical model.\n", "  We investigate the problem of what evolutions an open quantum system\ndescribed by a time-local Master equation can undergo with universal coherent\ncontrols. A series of conditions are given which exclude channels from being\nreachable by any unitary controls, assuming that the coupling to the\nenvironment is not being modified. These conditions primarily arise by defining\ndecay rates for the generator of the dynamics of the open system, and then\nshowing that controlling the system can only make these rates more isotropic.\nThis forms a series of constraints on the shape and non-unitality of allowed\nevolutions, as well as an expression for the time required to reach a given\ngoal. We give numerical examples of the usefulness of these criteria, and\nexplore some similarities they have with quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  We derive the joint probability distribution of the first two spectral\nmoments for the G$\\beta$E random matrix ensembles in N dimensions for any N.\nThis is achieved by making use of two complementary invariants of the domain in\n$\\mathbb{R}^N$ where the spectral moments are defined. Our approach is\nsignificantly different from those employed previously to answer related\nquestions and potentially offers new insights. We also discuss the problems\nfaced when attempting to include higher spectral moments.\n", "  We investigate the neutral hidden charm pentaquark states $P_c^0(4380)$ and\n$P_c^0(4450)$ in $\\pi^-p \\to J/\\psi n$ reaction within an effective Lagrangian\napproach. The background contributions for the process mainly come from\n$t$-channel $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ meson exchanges. The contributions of\n$P_c^0(4380)$ and $P_c^0(4450)$ states give clear peak structures in the\nmagnitude of 1 $\\mu$b at center of mass energy 4.38 GeV and 4.45 GeV in the\ntotal cross sections. Hence, this reaction may provide a new good platform to\nsearch for neutral $P_c$ states. It is expected that our estimated total cross\nsections together with the angular distributions can be tested by future\nexperiments at J-PARC.\n", "  Opening up a band gap of the graphene and finding a suitable substrate are\ntwo challenges for constituting the nano-electronic equipment. A new\ntwo-dimensional layered crystal g-C2N (Nat. Commun. 2015, 6, 1--7) with novel\nelectronic and optical properties can be effectively synthesized via a\nwet-chemical reaction. And g-C2N can be used as a suitable substrate to open\nthe band gap of graphene as much as 0.239 eV, which is large enough for the\nband gap opening at room temperature. The physics behind the band gap opening\nis that g-C2N substrate can produce the inhomogeneous electrostatic potential\nover the graphene layer. The imposition of external electrical field can tune\nthe band gap of the hybrid of graphene/g-C2N effectively from the\nsemiconductors to the metal. The hybrid graphene/g-C2N displays an enhanced\noptical activity compared with the pure g-C2N monolayer.\n", "  In this note we continue to pursue the question whether gauge theories can be\nrepresented in terms of effective \"scalar\" degrees of freedom. We provide such\na consistent representation for a free photon theory in 3+1 dimensions.\nBuilding on results of [1] we construct a Lagrangian with a four derivative\nkinetic term, and demonstrate that despite seeming nonlinearity of the theory\nit is equivalent to a theory of a free photon.\n", "  We study flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models for a\nscalar field coupled nonminimally to teleparallel gravity with generic coupling\nand potential functions. The goal of this paper is to determine the conditions\nunder which the cosmological evolution tends to the limit where the variation\nof the gravitational \"constant\" ceases and the system evolves close to general\nrelativity. These conditions can be read off from the approximate analytical\nsolutions describing the process in matter and potential domination eras. Only\nthose models where the GR limit exists and is an attractor can be considered\nviable. We expect the results to hold in the original \"pure tetrad\" formulation\nas well as in the recently suggested covariant formulation of the teleparallel\ntheory. In the former case the GR attractor simultaneously provides a mechanism\nhow cosmological evolution suppresses the problematic degrees of freedom\nstemming from the lack of local Lorentz invariance.\n", "  The main goal of the experimental programs on ultra-relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions at the LHC is the production and characterization of the Quark Gluon\nPlasma (QGP), a phase of nuclear matter in which strongly interacting\nconstituents (quarks and gluons) are deconfined. Heavy quarks are considered\neffective probes of the properties of the QGP as they are created on a short\ntime scale, with respect to that of the QGP, and subsequently interact with it.\nMoreover, for a proper assessment of the characteristics of the matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions, it is important to disentangle the final state effects\ndue to the formation of a QGP from the initial state effects due to the fact\nthat nuclei are present in the colliding system. Both initial and final state\neffects may lead to qualitatively similar phenomena in the observables of\ninterest. The measurement of charmed meson production in proton-nucleus\ncollisions allows to assess initial state effects present in nuclear\ncollisions, under the assumption that an extended deconfined medium is not\ncreated in this kind of interactions. The nuclear modification factor of $D$\nmesons in p-Pb collisions ($R_{\\rm pPb}$) is essential for a complete\nunderstanding of the modification of $D$ mesons momentum distributions observed\nin Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$= 2.76 TeV, which is interpreted as\ndue to the $c$-quark energy loss in the medium. In addition, some of the\nresults obtained from high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions at LHC, such as the\nridge structure in the two-particle correlation function, turned out to be\nunexpected, and have been interpreted in terms of final state effects such as\nhydrodynamic flow. These aspects make a study of charmed meson production in\np-Pb collisions as a function of the event multiplicity of great interest.\n", "  A damped driven pendulum with a magnetic driving force, appearing from a\nsolenoid, where ac current flows is considered. The solenoid acts on the\nmagnet, which is located at the free end of the pendulum. In this system, the\nexistence and interrelation of chaos and parametric resonance is theoretically\nexamined. Derived analytical results are supported by numerical simulations and\nconducted experiments.\n", "  Physical properties were derived for the candidate open cluster La Serena 94,\nrecently unveiled by the VVV collaboration. Thanks to the exquisite angular\nresolution provided by GeMS/GSAOI, we could characterize this system in detail,\nfor the first time, with deep photometry in JHK$_{s}$ - bands. Decontaminated\nJHK$_{s}$ diagrams reach about 5 mag below the cluster turnoff in H. The locus\nof red clump giants in the colour - colour diagram, together with an extinction\nlaw, was used to obtain an average extinction of $A_V =14.18 \\pm 0.71$. The\nsame stars were considered as standard - candles to derive the cluster\ndistance, $8.5 \\pm 1.0$ kpc. Isochrones were matched to the cluster colour -\nmagnitude diagrams to determine its age, $\\log{t(yr)}=9.12\\pm 0.06$, and\nmetallicity, $Z=0.02\\pm0.01$. A core radius of $r_{c}=0.51\\pm 0.04$ pc was\nfound by fitting King models to the radial density profile. By adding up the\nvisible stellar mass to an extrapolated mass function, the cluster mass was\nestimated as $M=(2.65\\pm0.57) \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$, consistent with an\nintegrated magnitude of $M_{K}=-5.82\\pm0.16$ and a tidal radius of\n$r_{t}=17.2\\pm2.1$ pc. The overall characteristics of La Serena 94 confirm that\nit is an old open cluster located in the Crux spiral arm towards the fourth\nGalactic quadrant and distant $7.30\\pm 0.49$ kpc from the Galactic centre. The\ncluster distorted structure, mass segregation and age indicate that it is a\ndynamically evolved stellar system.\n", "  We consider two Higgs doublet models with a softly broken U(1) symmetry, for\nvarious limiting values of the scalar mixing angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. These\ncorrespond to the Standard Model Higgs particle being the lighter CP-even\nscalar (alignment) or the heavier CP-even scalar (reverse alignment), and also\nthe limit in which some of the Yukawa couplings of this particle are of the\nopposite sign from the vector boson couplings (wrong sign). In these limits we\nimpose a criterion for naturalness by demanding that quadratic divergences\ncancel at one loop. We plot the allowed masses of the remaining physical\nscalars based on naturalness, stability, perturbative unitarity and constraints\ncoming from the $\\rho$ parameter. We also calculate the $h\\to \\gamma\\gamma$\ndecay rate in the wrong sign limit.\n", "  We resolve the real-time dynamics of a purely dissipative $s = 1/2$ quantum\nspin or, equivalently, hard-core boson model on a hypercubic $d$-dimensional\nlattice. The considered quantum dissipative process drives the system to a\ntotally symmetric macroscopic superposition in each of the $S^3$ sectors.\nDifferent characteristic time scales are identified for the dynamics and we\ndetermine their finite-size scaling. We introduce the concept of cumulative\nentanglement distribution to quantify multiparticle entanglement and show that\nthe considered protocol serves as an efficient method to prepare a\nmacroscopically entangled Bose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  We propose a generalized $\\mu-\\tau$ reflection symmetry to constrain the\nlepton flavor mixing parameters. We obtain a new correlation between the\natmospheric mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ and the \"Dirac\" CP violation phase\n$\\delta_{\\rm CP}$. Only in a specific limit our proposed CP transformation\nreduces to standard $\\mu-\\tau$ reflection, for which $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\delta_{CP}$ are both maximal. The \"Majorana\" phases are predicted to lie at\ntheir CP-conserving values with important implications for the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay rates. We also study the phenomenological implications of our\nscheme for present and future neutrino oscillation experiments including T2K,\nNO$\\nu$A and DUNE.\n", "  We perform first-principles band structure calculations for the tetragonal\nand monoclinic structures of LaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_2$. We find that the Bi\n$6p_{x,y}$ bands on two BiS$_2$ layers exhibit a sizable splitting at the X =\n($\\pi$, 0, 0) and several other \\textbf{k}-points for the monoclinic structure.\nWe show that this feature originates from the inter-BiS$_2$ layer coupling\nstrongly enhanced by the symmetry breaking of the crystal structure. The Fermi\nsurface also shows a large splitting and becomes anisotropic with respect to\nthe $k_x$ and $k_y$ directions in the monoclinic structure, whereas it remains\nalmost flat with respect to the $k_z$ direction.\n", "  We study the low-energy physics of a broad class of time-reversal invariant\nand SU(2)-symmetric one-dimensional spin-S systems in the presence of quenched\ndisorder via a strong-disorder renormalization-group technique. We show that,\nin general, there is an antiferromagnetic phase with an emergent SU(2S+1)\nsymmetry. The ground state of this phase is a random singlet state in which the\nsinglets are formed by pairs of spins. For integer spins, there is an\nadditional antiferromagnetic phase which does not exhibit any emergent symmetry\n(except for S=1). The corresponding ground state is a random singlet one but\nthe singlets are formed mostly by trios of spins. In each case the\ncorresponding low-energy dynamics is activated, i.e., with a formally infinite\ndynamical exponent, and related to distinct infinite-randomness fixed points.\nThe phase diagram has two other phases with ferromagnetic tendencies: a\ndisordered ferromagnetic phase and a large spin phase in which the effective\ndisorder is asymptotically finite. In the latter case, the dynamical scaling is\ngoverned by a conventional power law with a finite dynamical exponent.\n", "  We demonstrate laser-driven two-qubit and single-qubit logic gates with\nfidelities 99.9(1)% and 99.9934(3)% respectively, significantly above the\napproximately 99% minimum threshold level required for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation, using qubits stored in hyperfine ground states of calcium-43 ions\nheld in a room-temperature trap. We study the speed/fidelity trade-off for the\ntwo-qubit gate, for gate times between 3.8$\\mu$s and 520$\\mu$s, and develop a\ntheoretical error model which is consistent with the data and which allows us\nto identify the principal technical sources of infidelity.\n", "  We derive a necessary condition for the existence of marginally stable\ncircular orbits of test particles in stationary axisymmetric spacetimes which\npossess a refection symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane; photon\norbits are also addressed. Energy and angular momentum are shown to decouple\nfrom metric quantities, rendering a purely geometric characterization of\ncircular orbits for this general class of metrics. The subsequent system is\nanalyzed using resultants, providing an algorithmic approach for finding MSCO\nconditions. MSCOs are explicitly calculated for concrete examples of physical\ninterest.\n", "  We analyze the second-class current decays\n$\\tau^{-}\\to\\pi^{-}\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\nu_{\\tau}$ in the framework of Chiral\nPerturbation Theory with resonances. Taking into account\n$\\pi^{0}$-$\\eta$-$\\eta^{\\prime}$ mixing, the $\\pi^{-}\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ vector\nform factor is extracted, in a model-independent way, using existing data on\nthe $\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}$ one. For the participant scalar form factor, we have\nconsidered different parameterizations ordered according to their increasing\nfulfillment of analyticity and unitarity constraints. We start with a\nBreit-Wigner parameterization dominated by the $a_{0}(980)$ scalar resonance\nand after we include its excited state, the $a_{0}(1450)$. We follow by an\nelastic dispersion relation representation through the Omn\\`{e}s integral.\nThen, we illustrate a method to derive a closed-form expression for the\n$\\pi^{-}\\eta$, $\\pi^{-}\\eta^{\\prime}$ (and $K^{-}K^{0}$) scalar form factors in\na coupled-channels treatment. Finally, predictions for the branching ratios and\nspectra are discussed emphasizing the error analysis. An interesting result of\nthis study is that both $\\tau^{-}\\to\\pi^{-}\\eta^{(\\prime)}\\nu_{\\tau}$ decay\nchannels are promising for the soon discovery of second-class currents at\nBelle-II. We also predict the relevant observables for the partner\n$\\eta^{(\\prime)}_{\\ell 3}$ decays, which are extremely suppressed in the\nStandard Model.\n", "  The Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN) III-Nitride ternary alloy has the\npotentiality to allow achieving high efficiency solar cells through the tuning\nof its band gap by changing the Indium composition. It also counts among its\nadvantages a relatively low effective mass, high carriers\\^a mobility, a high\nabsorption coefficient along with good radiation tolerance.However, the main\ndrawback of InGaN is linked to its p-type doping, which is difficult to grow in\ngood quality and on which ohmic contacts are difficult to realize. The Schottky\nsolar cell is a good alternative to avoid the p-type doping of InGaN. In this\nreport, a comprehensive numerical simulation, using mathematically rigorous\noptimization approach based on state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, is\nused to find the optimum geometrical and physical parameters that yield the\nbest efficiency of a Schottky solar cell within the achievable device\nfabrication range. A 18.2% efficiency is predicted for this new InGaN solar\ncell design.\n", "  We have developed a correction tool to improve the quality of RXTE HEXTE\nspectra by employing the same method we used earlier to improve the quality of\nRXTE PCA spectra. We fit all of the hundreds of HEXTE spectra of the Crab\nindividually to a simple power-law model, some 37 million counts in total for\nCluster A and 39 million counts for Cluster B, and we create for each cluster a\ncombined spectrum of residuals. We find that the residual spectrum of Cluster A\nis free of instrumental artifacts while that of Cluster B contains significant\nfeatures with amplitudes ~1%; the most prominent is in the energy range 30-50\nkeV, which coincides with the iodine K edge. Starting with the residual\nspectrum for Cluster B, via an iterative procedure we created the calibration\ntool hexBcorr for correcting any Cluster B spectrum of interest. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of the tool by applying it to Cluster B spectra of two bright\nblack holes, which contain several million counts apiece. For these spectra,\napplication of the tool significantly improves the goodness of fit, while\naffecting only slightly the broadband fit parameters. The tool may be important\nfor the study of spectral features, such as cyclotron lines, a topic that is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n", "  Starting from a set of different two- and three-nucleon interactions from\nchiral effective field theory, we use the importance-truncated no-core shell\nmodel for ab initio calculations of excitation energies as well as electric\nquadrupole (E2) and magnetic dipole (M1) moments and transition strengths for\nselected p-shell nuclei. We explore the sensitivity of the excitation energies\nto the chiral interactions as a first step towards and systematic uncertainty\npropagation from chiral inputs to nuclear structure observables. The\nuncertainty band spanned by the different chiral interactions is typically in\nagreement with experimental excitation energies, but we also identify\nobservables with notable discrepancies beyond the theoretical uncertainty that\nreveal insufficiencies in the chiral interactions. For electromagnetic\nobservables we identify correlations among pairs of E2 or M1 observables based\non the ab initio calculations for the different interactions. We find extremely\nrobust correlations for E2 observables and illustrate how these correlations\ncan be used to predict one observable based on an experimental datum for the\nsecond observable. In this way we circumvent convergence issues and arrive at\nfar more accurate results than any direct ab initio calculation. A prime\nexample for this approach is the quadrupole moment of the first 2^+ state in\nC-12, which is predicted with an drastically improved accuracy.\n", "  From the unified statistical thermodynamics of quantum gases, the virial\ncoefficients of ideal Bose and Fermi gases which are trapped under generic\npower law potential are derived systematically. From the general result of\nvirial coefficients, one can produce the known results in $d=3$ and $d=2$. But\nmore importantly we found that, the virial coefficients of bosons and fermions\nbecome equal (except the the second virial coefficient, where the sign is\ndifferent) when we trap the gases under harmonic potential in $d=1$. This\nresult suggests the equivalence between Bose and Fermi gases which is already\nestablished for $d=1$ by M M Faruk (J Stat Phys, DOI\n10.1007/s10955-015-1344-4). Surprisingly our investigation also shows that the\nvirial coefficients of two dimensional free quantum gases are identical to the\nvirial coefficients of one dimensional harmonically trapped quantum gases.\n", "  Compactifications of the physical superstring to two dimensions provide a\ngeneral template for realizing 2D conformal field theories coupled to\nworldsheet gravity, i.e. non-critical string theories. Motivated by this\nobservation, in this paper we determine the quasi-topological 8D theory which\ngoverns the vacua of 2D N = (0,2) gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) obtained\nfrom compactifications of type I and heterotic strings on a Calabi-Yau\nfourfold. We also determine the quasi-topological 6D theory governing the 2D\nvacua of intersecting 7-branes in compactifications of F-theory on an\nelliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fivefold, where matter fields and interaction\nterms localize on lower-dimensional subspaces, i.e. defect operators. To cancel\nanomalies / cancel tadpoles, these GLSMs must couple to additional chiral\nsectors, which in some cases do not admit a known description in terms of a UV\nGLSM. Additionally, we find that constructing an anomaly free spectrum can\nsometimes break supersymmetry due to spacetime filling anti-branes. We also\nstudy various canonical examples such as the standard embedding of heterotic\nstrings on a Calabi-Yau fourfold and F-theoretic \"rigid clusters\" with no local\ndeformation moduli of the elliptic fibration.\n", "  Surface coatings and patterning technologies are essential for various\nphysicochemical applications. In this Letter, we describe key parameters to\nachieve uniform particle coatings from binary solutions: First, multiple\nsequential Marangoni flows, set by solute and surfactant simultaneously,\nprevent non-uniform particle distributions and continuously mix suspended\nmaterials during droplet evaporation. Second, we show the importance of\nparticle-surface interactions that can be established by surface-adsorbed\nmacromolecules. To achieve a uniform deposit in a binary mixture, a small\nconcentration of surfactant and surface-adsorbed polymer (0.05 wt% each) is\nsufficient, which offers a new physicochemical avenue for control of coatings.\n", "  There is now copious direct experimental evidence of various forms of\n(short-range) charge order in underdoped cuprate high temperature\nsuperconductors, and spectroscopic signatures of a nodal-antinodal dichotomy in\nthe structure of the single-particle spectral functions. In this context, we\nanalyze the Bogoliubov quasiparticle spectrum in a superconducting nematic\nglass. The coincidence of the superconducting \"nodal points\" and the nematic\n\"cold-spots\" on the Fermi surface naturally accounts for many of the most\nsalient features of the measured spectral functions (from angle-resolved\nphotoemission) and the local density of states (from scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy).\n", "  The corrections of gluon fusion to the DGLAP and BFKL equations are discussed\nin a united partonic framework. The resulting nonlinear evolution equations are\nthe well-known GLR-MQ-ZRS equation and a new evolution equation. Using the\navailable saturation models as input, we find that the new evolution equation\nhas the chaos solution with positive Lyaponov exponents in the perturbative\nrange. We predict a new kind of shadowing caused by chaos, which blocks the QCD\nevolution in a critical small $x$ range. The blocking effect in the evolution\nequation may explain the Abelian gluon assumption and even influence our\nexpectations to the projected Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), Very Large\nHadron Collider (VLHC) and the upgrade (CppC) in a circular $e^+e^-$ collider\n(SppC).\n", "  We study the laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator through the coupling\nwith a dissipative three-level system. Under a background temperature beyond\nthe Lamb-Dicke regime, we extend the standard cooling analysis by separately\nstudying the classical motion and the quantum dynamics of the oscillator. In\nLadder-system cooling, the cooling rate degrades by orders of magnitude at\nlarge classical motion. This phenomenon causes a critical transition of the\nfinal temperature at a hot background. In stark contrast,\nelectromagnetic-induced-transparency (EIT) cooling with a $\\Lambda$-system\nproduces significant negative cooling rate at high motional excitation. At\nsteady state, the oscillator could exhibit both cooling and lasing behaviours.\nWe argue that a successful EIT cooling requires either a poor quality\noscillator to suppress the lasing effect, or terminating the cooling process at\na transient stage.\n", "  We consider mixing by incompressible flows. In 2003, Bressan stated a\nconjecture concerning a bound on the mixing achieved by the flow in terms of an\n$L^1$ norm of the velocity field. Existing results in the literature use an\n$L^p$ norm with $p>1$. In this paper we introduce a new approach to prove such\nresults. It recovers most of the existing results and offers new perpective on\nthe problem. Our approach makes use of a recent harmonic analysis estimate from\nSeeger, Smart and Street.\n", "  Skyrmions and domain walls are typical spin textures of significant\ntechnological relevance to magnetic memory and logic applications, where they\nare used as carriers of information. The unique topology of skyrmions makes\nthem to display distinct dynamical properties compared to domain walls. Some\nstudies have demonstrated that the two topologically inequivalent magnetic\nobjects could be interconverted by cleverly designed geometric structures.\nHere, we numerically address the skyrmion-domain wall collision in a magnetic\nracetrack by introducing relative motion between the two objects based on a\nspecially designed junction. An electric current serves as the driving force\nthat moves a skyrmion toward a trapped domain-wall pair. We observe different\ntypes of collision dynamics by changing the driving parameters. Most\nimportantly, the domain wall modulation of skyrmion transport is realized in\nthis system, allowing a set of domain wall-gated logical NOT, NAND, and NOR\ngates to be constructed. By providing a promising logic architecture that is\nfully compatible with racetrack memories, this work is expected to speed up the\ndevelopment of skyrmion-based magnetic computation.\n", "  Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are likely produced in the shock that is\ndriven as the GRB jet interacts with the external medium. Long-duration GRBs\nare also associated with powerful supernovae (SNe). We consider the optical and\nradio afterglows of long GRBs for both blasts viewed along the jet axis\n(\"on-axis\" afterglows) and misaligned observes (\"off-axis\" afterglows).\nComparing the optical emission from the afterglow with that of the accompanying\nSN, using SN 1998bw as an archetype, we find that only a few percent of\nafterglows viewed off-axis are brighter than the SN. For observable optical\noff-axis afterglows, the viewing angle is at most twice the half-opening angle\nof the GRB jet. Radio off-axis afterglows should be detected with upcoming\nradio surveys within a few hundred Mpc. We propose that these surveys will act\nas \"radio triggers\", and that dedicated radio facilities should follow-up these\nsources. Follow-ups can unveil the presence of the radio SN remnant, if\npresent. In addition, they can probe the presence of a mildly relativistic\ncomponent, either associated with the GRB jet or the SN ejecta, expected in\nthese sources.\n", "  We numerically study the fractional quantum Hall effect at filling factors\n$\\nu=12/5$ and 13/5 (the particle-hole conjugate of 12/5) in high-quality\ntwo-dimensional GaAs heterostructures via exact diagonalization including\nfinite well width and Landau level mixing. We find that Landau level mixing\nsuppresses $\\nu=13/5$ fractional quantum Hall effect relative to $\\nu=12/5$. By\ncontrast, we find both $\\nu=2/5$ and (its particle-hole conjugate) $\\nu=3/5$\nfractional quantum Hall effects in the lowest Landau level to be robust under\nLandau level mixing and finite well-width corrections. Our results provide a\npossible explanation for the experimental absence of the 13/5 fractional\nquantum Hall state as caused by Landau level mixing effects.\n", "  Studies measuring the star formation rate density, luminosity function, and\nproperties of star-forming galaxies are numerous. However, it exists a gap at\n$0.5<z<0.8$ in H$\\alpha$-based studies. Our main goal is to study the\nproperties of a sample of faint H$\\alpha$ emitters at $z\\sim0.62$. We focus on\ntheir contribution to the faint end of the luminosity function and derived star\nformation rate density, characterising their morphologies and basic photometric\nand spectroscopic properties. We use a narrow-band technique in the\nnear-infrared, with a filter centred at 1.06 $\\mu$m. The data come from\nultra-deep VLT/HAWK-I observations in the GOODS-S field with a total of 31.9 h\nin the narrow-band filter. We perform a visual classification of the sample and\nstudy their morphologies from structural parameters available in CANDELS. Our\n28 H$\\alpha$-selected sample of faint star-forming galaxies reveals a robust\nfaint-end slope of the luminosity function $\\alpha=-1.46_{-0.08}^{+0.16}$. The\nderived star formation rate density at $z\\sim0.62$ is $\\rho_\\mathrm{SFR} =\n0.036_{-0.008}^{+0.012} M_{\\odot}~\\mathrm{yr^{-1}~Mpc^{-3}}$. The sample is\nmainly composed of disks, but an important contribution of compact galaxies\nwith S\\'ersic indexes $n\\sim2$ display the highest specific star formation\nrates. The luminosity function at $z\\sim0.62$ from our ultra-deep data points\ntowards a steeper $\\alpha$ when an individual extinction correction for each\nobject is applied. Compact galaxies are low-mass, low-luminosity, and\nstarburst-dominated objects with a light profile in an intermediate stage from\nearly to late types.\n", "  We use large-scale cosmological observations to place constraints on the\ndark-matter pressure, sound speed and viscosity, and infer a limit on the mass\nof warm-dark-matter particles. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies constrain the equation of state and sound speed of the dark\nmatter at last scattering at the per mille level. Since the redshifting of\ncollisionless particles universally implies that these quantities scale like\n$a^{-2}$ absent shell crossing, we infer that today $w_{\\rm (DM)}< 10^{-10.0}$,\n$c_{\\rm s,(DM)}^2 < 10^{-10.7}$ and $c_{\\rm vis, (DM)}^{2} < 10^{-10.3}$ at the\n$99\\%$ confidence level. This very general bound can be translated to\nmodel-dependent constraints on dark-matter models: for warm dark matter these\nconstraints imply $m> 70$ eV, assuming it decoupled while relativistic around\nthe same time as the neutrinos; for a cold relic, we show that $m>100$ eV. We\nseparately constrain the properties of the DM fluid on linear scales at late\ntimes, and find upper bounds $c_{\\rm s, (DM)}^2<10^{-5.9}$, $c_{\\rm vis,\n(DM)}^{2} < 10^{-5.7}$, with no detection of non-dust properties for the DM.\n", "  The $\\mathbb{C}P^N$ extended Skyrme-Faddeev model possesses planar soliton\nsolutions. We consider quantum aspects of the solutions applying collective\ncoordinate quantization in regime of rigid body approximation. In order to\ndiscuss statistical properties of the solutions we include an Abelian\nChern-Simons term (the Hopf term) in the Lagrangian. Since\n$\\Pi_3(\\mathbb{C}P^1)=\\mathbb{Z}$ then for $N=1$ the term becomes an integer.\nOn the other hand for $N>1$ it became perturbative because\n$\\Pi_3(\\mathbb{C}P^N)$ is trivial. The prefactor of the Hopf term (anyon angle)\n$\\Theta$ is not quantized and its value depends on the physical system. The\ncorresponding fermionic models can fix value of the angle $\\Theta$ for all $N$\nin a way that the soliton with $N=1$ is not an anyon type whereas for $N>1$ it\nis always an anyon even for $\\Theta=n\\pi, n\\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We quantize the\nsolutions and calculate several mass spectra for $N=2$. Finally we discuss\ngeneralization for $N\\geqq 3$.\n", "  Searching for room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors has evolved into\na broad field of material science and spintronics for decades, nevertheless,\nthese novel states remain rare. Phosphorene, a monolayer black phosphorus with\na puckered honeycomb lattice structure possessing a finite band gap and high\ncarrier mobility, has been synthesized recently. Here we show, by means of two\ndifferent large scale quantum Monte-Carlo methods, that relatively weak\ninteractions can lead to remarkable edge magnetism in the phosphorene\nnanoribbons. The ground state constrained path quantum Monte-Carlo simulations\nreveal strong ferromagnetic correlations along the zigzag edges, and the finite\ntemperature determinant quantum Monte-Carlo calculations show a high Curie\ntemperature up to room temperature.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing causes subtle changes in the apparent shapes of\ngalaxies due to the bending of light by the gravity of foreground masses. By\nmeasuring the shapes of large numbers of galaxies (millions in recent surveys,\nup to tens of billions in future surveys) we can infer the parameters that\ndetermine cosmology. Imperfections in the detectors used to record images of\nthe sky can introduce changes in the apparent shape of galaxies, which in turn\ncan bias the inferred cosmological parameters. In this paper we consider the\neffect of two widely discussed sensor imperfections: tree-rings, due to\nimpurity gradients which cause transverse electric fields in the Charge-Coupled\nDevices (CCD), and pixel-size variation, due to periodic CCD fabrication\nerrors. These imperfections can be observed when the detectors are subject to\nuniform illumination (flat field images). We develop methods to determine the\nspurious shear and convergence (due to the imperfections) from the flat-field\nimages. We calculate how the spurious shear when added to the lensing shear\nwill bias the determination of cosmological parameters. We apply our methods to\ncandidate sensors of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) as a timely and\nimportant example, analyzing flat field images recorded with LSST prototype\nCCDs in the laboratory. We find that tree-rings and periodic pixel-size\nvariation present in the LSST CCDs will introduce negligible bias to\ncosmological parameters determined from the lensing power spectrum,\nspecifically w, {\\Omega}m and {\\sigma}8.\n", "  We use six years of accurate hyperfine frequency comparison data of the dual\nrubidium and caesium cold atom fountain FO2 at LNE-SYRTE to search for a\nmassive scalar dark matter candidate. Such a scalar field can induce harmonic\nvariations of the fine structure constant, of the mass of fermions and of the\nquantum chromodynamic mass scale, which will directly impact the\nrubidium/caesium hyperfine transition frequency ratio. We find no signal\nconsistent with a scalar dark matter candidate but provide improved constraints\non the coupling of the putative scalar field to standard matter. Our limits are\ncomplementary to previous results that were only sensitive to the fine\nstructure constant, and improve them by more than an order of magnitude when\nonly a coupling to electromagnetism is assumed.\n", "  Solitons, defined as nonlinear waves which can reflect from boundaries or\ntransmit through each other, are found in conservative, fully integrable\nsystems. Similar phenomena, dubbed quasi-solitons, have been observed also in\ndissipative, \"excitable\" systems, either at finely tuned parameters (near a\nbifurcation) or in systems with cross-diffusion. Here we demonstrate that\nquasi-solitons can be robustly observed in excitable systems with excitable\nkinetics and with self-diffusion only. This includes quasi-solitons of fixed\nshape (like KdV solitons) or envelope quasi-solitons (like NLS solitons). This\ncan happen in systems with more than two components, and can be explained by\neffective cross-diffusion, which emerges via adiabatic elimination of a fast\nbut diffusing component. We describe here a reduction procedure can be used for\nthe search of complicated wave regimes in multi-component, stiff systems by\nstudying simplified, soft systems.\n", "  In this paper it is studied the influence of a minimal thermal environment on\nthe dynamics of a quantum harmonic oscillator (labelled A), prepared in a\ncoherent state. The environment itself consists of a second oscillator\n(labelled B), initially in a thermal state. Two types of interaction\nHamiltonians are considered, and the time-evolution of the reduced density\noperator of oscillator A is compared to the one obtained from the usual master\nequation approach, i.e., assuming that oscillator A is coupled to a large\nreservoir. An analysis of the linear entropy evolution of oscillator A shows\nthat simplified models may be able to describe important features related to\nthe phenomenon of decoherence.\n", "  Obtaining high-quality thin films of 5d transition metal oxides is essential\nto explore the exotic semimetallic and topological phases predicted to arise\nfrom the combination of strong electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling.\nHere, we show that the transport properties of SrIrO3 thin films, grown by\npulsed laser deposition, can be optimized by considering the effect of\nlaser-induced modification of the SrIrO3 target surface. We further demonstrate\nthat bare SrIrO3 thin films are subject to degradation in air and are highly\nsensitive to lithographic processing. A crystalline SrTiO3 cap layer deposited\nin-situ is effective in preserving the film quality, allowing us to measure\nmetallic transport behavior in films with thicknesses down to 4 unit cells. In\naddition, the SrTiO3 encapsulation enables the fabrication of devices such as\nHall bars without altering the film properties, allowing precise\n(magneto)transport measurements on micro- and nanoscale devices.\n", "  Extensive dynamical simulations of Restricted Solid on Solid models in\n$D=2+1$ dimensions have been done using parallel multisurface algorithms\nimplemented on graphics cards. Numerical evidence is presented that these\nmodels exhibit KPZ surface growth scaling, irrespective of the step heights\n$N$. We show that by increasing $N$ the corrections to scaling increase, thus\nsmaller step-sized models describe better the asymptotic, long-wave-scaling\nbehavior.\n", "  Layered compounds AMnBi2 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba, or rare earth element) have been\nestablished as Dirac materials. Dirac electrons generated by the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Bi square net in these materials are normally massive due\nto the presence of a spin-orbital coupling (SOC) induced gap at Dirac nodes.\nHere we report that the Sb square net in an isostructural compound BaMnSb2 can\nhost nearly massless Dirac fermions. We observed strong Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\noscillations in this material. From the analyses of the SdH oscillations, we\nfind key signatures of Dirac fermions, including light effective mass\n(~0.052m0; m0, mass of free electron), high quantum mobility (1280 cm2V-1S-1)\nand a Pi Berry phase accumulated along cyclotron orbit. Compared with AMnBi2,\nBaMnSb2 also exhibits much more significant quasi two-dimensional (2D)\nelectronic structure, with the out-of-plane transport showing nonmetallic\nconduction below 120K and the ratio of the out-of-plane and in-plane\nresistivity reaching ~670. Additionally, BaMnSb2 also exhibits an\nantiferromagnetic order with a weak ferromagnetic component. The combination of\nnearly massless Dirac fermions on quasi-2D planes with a magnetic order makes\nBaMnSb2 an intriguing platform for seeking novel exotic phenomena of massless\nDirac electrons.\n", "  We study the observed $B^-\\rightarrow X(3823)K^-$ decay via rescattering\nmechanism and show that this branching ratio is well reproduced by this\nmechanism. We further extend this theoretical framework to investigate the\ndecays of $B^-\\to\\eta_{c2} (^1D_2)/\\psi_3(^3D_3)K^-$, where the $\\eta_{c2}\n(^1D_2)$ and the $\\psi_3(^3D_3)$ are $D$-wave charmonium partners of the\n$X(3823)$. Our results show that the branching ratios, $B^-\\to \\eta_{c2}(^1D_2)\nK^-$ and $B^-\\to \\psi_3(^3D_3) K^-$, are of the order of $10^{-5}$, which can\nbe accessible at LHCb, Belle and forthcoming BelleII.\n", "  We study the dark matter (DM) direct detection for the models with the\neffects of the isospin-violating couplings, exothermic scatterings, and/or the\nlightness of the mediator, proposed to relax the tension between the CDMS-Si\nsignals and null experiments. In the light of the new updates of the LUX and\nCDMSlite data, we find that many of the previous proposals are now ruled out,\nincluding the Ge-phobic exothermic DM model and the Xe-phobic DM one with a\nlight mediator. We also examine the exothermic DM models with a light mediator\nbut without the isospin violation, and we are unable to identify any available\nparameter space that could simultaneously satisfy all the experiments. The only\nmodels that can partially relax the inconsistencies are the Xe-phobic\nexothermic DM models with or without a light mediator. But even in this case, a\nlarge portion of the CDMS-Si regions of interest has been constrained by the\nLUX and SuperCDMS data.\n", "  The dynamical response of an Ising ferromagnet to a plane polarised standing\nmagnetic field wave is modelled and studied here by Monte Carlo simulation in\ntwo dimensions. The amplitude of standing magnetic wave is modulated along the\ndirection x. We have detected two main dynamical phases namely, pinned and\noscillating spin clusters. Depending on the value of field amplitude the system\nis found to undergo a phase transition from oscillating spin cluster to pinned\nas the system is cooled down. The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle\nof magnetic field oscillations is defined as the dynamic order parameter. The\ntransition is detected by studying the temperature dependences of the variance\nof the dynamic order parameter, the derivative of the dynamic order parameter\nand the dynamic specific heat. The dependence of the transition temperature on\nthe magnetic field amplitude and on the wavelength of the magnetic field wave\nis studied at a single frequency. A comprehensive phase boundary is drawn in\nthe plane described by the temperature and field amplitude for two different\nwavelengths of the magnetic wave. The variation of instantaneous line\nmagnetisation during a period of magnetic field oscillation for standing wave\nmode is compared to those for the propagating wave mode. Also the probability\nthat a spin at any site, flips, is calculated. The above mentioned variations\nand the probability of spin flip clearly distinguish between the dynamical\nphases formed by propagating magnetic wave and by standing magnetic wave in an\nIsing ferromagnet.\n", "  Helical Majorana edge states at the 2D boundaries of 3D topological\nsuperconductors can be gapped by a surface Zeeman field. Here we study the\neffect nested defects imprinted on the Zeeman field can have on the edge\nstates. We demonstrate that depending on the configuration of the field we can\ninduce dimensional reduction of gapless Majorana modes from 2D to 1D or\nquasi-0D at magnetic domain walls. We determine the nature of the Majorana\nlocalisation on these defects as a function of the magnitude and configuration\nof the Zeeman field. Finally, we observe a generalisation of the index theorem\ngoverning the number of gapless modes at the interface between topologically\nnon-trivial systems with partial Chern numbers.\n", "  The absorption feature O I 7773 is an important spectral indicator for type\nIa supernovae (SNe~Ia) that can be used to trace the unburned material at outer\nlayers of the exploding white dwarf. In this work, we use a large sample of\nSNe~Ia to examine this absorption at early phases (i.e., -13 days <t <-7 days),\nand make comparisons with the absorption features of Si~II 6355 and Ca~II\nnear-infrared (NIR) triplet. We show that for a subgroup of spectroscopically\nnormal SNe with normal photospheric velocities (i.e., v_si < 12,500 km s^{-1}\nat optical maximum), the line strength of high velocity feature (HVF) of O~I is\ninversely correlated with that of Si~II (or Ca~II), and this feature also shows\na negative correlation with the luminosity of SNe Ia. This finding, together\nwith other features we find for the O~I HVF, reveal that for this subgroup of\nSNe~Ia explosive oxygen burning occurs at the outermost layer of supernova and\ndifference in burning there could lead to the observed diversity, which are in\nremarkable agreement with the popular delayed-detonation model of Chandrasekhar\nmass WD.\n", "  We study lepton flavor violation in a class of supersymmetric models with\nlight sgoldstino - scalar superpartner of Goldstone fermions responsible for\nspontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Sgoldstino couplings to the Standard Model\n(SM) fermions are determined by the MSSM soft terms and, in general, provide\nwith flavor violation in this sector. Sgoldstino admixture to the lightest\nHiggs boson results in changes of its coupling constants and, in particular,\nleads to lepton flavor-violating decay $h\\to\\tau\\mu$ of the Higgs resonance. We\ndiscuss viability and phenomenological consequences of this scenario.\n", "  We summarise the main experimental, phenomenological and theoretical issues\nrelated to the 750 GeV digamma excess\n", "  We examine how three fundamentally different numerical hydrodynamics codes\nfollow the evolution of an isothermal galactic disc with an external spiral\npotential. We compare an adaptive mesh refinement code (RAMSES), a smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics code (sphNG), and a volume-discretised meshless code\n(GIZMO). Using standard refinement criteria, we find that RAMSES produces a\ndisc that is less vertically concentrated and does not reach such high\ndensities as the sphNG or GIZMO runs. The gas surface density in the spiral\narms increases at a lower rate for the RAMSES simulations compared to the other\ncodes. There is also a greater degree of substructure in the sphNG and GIZMO\nruns and secondary spiral arms are more pronounced. By resolving the Jeans'\nlength with a greater number of grid cells we achieve more similar results to\nthe Lagrangian codes used in this study. Other alterations to the refinement\nscheme (adding extra levels of refinement and refining based on local density\ngradients) are less successful in reducing the disparity between RAMSES and\nsphNG/GIZMO. Although more similar, sphNG displays different density\ndistributions and vertical mass profiles to all modes of GIZMO (including the\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics version). This suggests differences also arise\nwhich are not intrinsic to the particular method but rather due to its\nimplementation. The discrepancies between codes (in particular, the densities\nreached in the spiral arms) could potentially result in differences in the\nlocations and timescales for gravitational collapse, and therefore impact star\nformation activity in more complex galaxy disc simulations.\n", "  Classical Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of long-time processes with\nstrongly separated time scales is computationally extremely demanding if not\nimpossible. Consequently, the state-of-the-art description of such systems is\nnot capable of real-time simulations or online process monitoring. In order to\nbridge this gap, we propose a new method suitable to decouple slow from fast\ndegrees of freedom in many cases. Based on the recurrence statistics of\nunsteady flow fields, we deduce a recurrence process which enables the generic\nrepresentation of pseudo-periodic motion at high spatial and temporal\nresolution. Based on these fields, passive scalars can be traced by recurrence\nCFD. While a first, Eulerian Model A solves a passive transport equation in a\nclassical implicit finite-volume environment, a second, Lagrangian Model B\npropagates fluid particles obeying a stochastic differential equation\nexplicitly. Finally, this new concept is tested by two multiphase processes - a\nlab scale oscillating bubble column and an industrial scale steelmaking\nconverter. Results of tracer distribution obtained by recurrence CFD are in\nvery good agreement with full CFD simulations, while computational times are\ndramatically reduced. Actually, recurrence CFD is a promising candidate for\nonline simulations of passive transport processes at full CFD resolution, which\nopens the door towards improved process monitoring.\n", "  It is well-known that the thermal Hawking-like radiation can be emitted from\nthe acoustic horizon, but the thermodynamic-like understanding for acoustic\nblack holes was rarely made. In this paper, we will show that the kinematic\nconnection can lead to the dynamic connection at the horizon between the fluid\nand gravitational models in two dimension, which implies that there exists the\nthermodynamic-like description for acoustic black holes. Then, we discuss the\nfirst law of thermodynamics for the acoustic black hole via an intriguing\nconnection between the gravitational-like dynamics of the acoustic horizon and\nthermodynamics. We obtain a universal form for the entropy of acoustic black\nholes, which has an interpretation similar to the entropic gravity. We also\ndiscuss the specific heat, and find that the derivative of the velocity of\nbackground fluid can be regarded as a novel acoustic analogue of the\ntwo-dimensional dilaton potential, which interprets why the two-dimensional\nfluid dynamics can be connected to the gravitational dynamics but difficult for\nfour-dimensional case. In particular, when a constraint is added for the fluid,\nthe analogue of a Schwarzschild black hole can be realized.\n", "  The Orion star-forming region is the nearest active high-mass star-forming\nregion and has created a large superbubble, the Orion-Eridanus superbubble.\nRecent work by Ochsendorf et al. has extended the accepted boundary of the\nsuperbubble. We fit Kompaneets models of superbubbles expanding in exponential\natmospheres to the new, larger shape of the Orion-Eridanus superbubble. We find\nthat this larger morphology of the superbubble is consistent with the evolution\nof the superbubble being primarily controlled by expansion into the exponential\nGalactic disk ISM if the superbubble is oriented with the Eridanus side farther\nfrom the Sun than the Orion side. Unlike previous Kompaneets model fits that\nrequired abnormally small scale heights for the Galactic disk (<40 pc), we find\nmorphologically consistent models with scale heights of 80 pc, similar to that\nexpected for the Galactic disk.\n", "  Unconventional emissions from exciton and trion in monolayer WS2 are studied\nby photoexcitation. Excited by 532nm laser beam, the carrier species in the\nmonolayer WS2 are affected by the excess electrons escaping from\nphotoionization of donor impurity, the concentration of which varies with\ndifferent locations of the sample. Simply increasing the excitation power at\nroom temperature, the excess electron and thus the intensity ratio of excited\ntrion and exciton can be continuously tuned over a large range from 0.1 to 7.7.\nFurthermore, this intensity ratio can also be manipulated by varying\ntemperature. However, in this way the resonance energy of the exciton and trion\nshow red-shifts with increasing temperature due to electron-phonon coupling.\nThe binding energy of the trion is determined to be ~23meV and independent to\ntemperature, indicating strong Coulomb interaction of carriers in such 2D\nmaterials.\n", "  High-brightness electron sources are a key ingredient to the development of\ncompact accelerator-based light sources. The electron sources are commonly\nbased on (linear) photoemission process where a laser pulse with proper\nwavelength impinges on the surface of a metallic or semiconductor photocathode.\nVery recently, the use of plasmonic cathodes - cathodes with a nano-patterned\nsurface - have demonstrated great enhancement in quantum efficiencies (Li et\nal., 2013 [1]). Alternatively, this type of photocathodes could support the\nformation of structured beams composed of transversely-separated beamlets. In\nthis paper we discuss numerical simulations of the early-stage beam dynamics of\nthe emission process from plasmonic cathodes carried out using the Warp\n(Friedman et al., 2014 [2]) framework. The model is used to investigate the\nproperties of beams emitted from these photocathode and subsequently combined\nwith particle-in-cell simulations to explore the imaging of cathode pattern\nafter acceleration in a radiofrequency gun.\n", "  Relativistic jets can form from at least some tidal disruption events (TDEs)\nof (sub-)stellar objects around supermassive black holes. We detect the\nmillimeter (MM) emission of IGR J12580+0134 --- the nearest TDE known in the\ngalaxy NGC 4845 at the distance of only 17 Mpc, based on Planck all-sky survey\ndata. The data show significant flux jumps after the event, followed by\nsubstantial declines, in all six high frequency Planck bands from 100 GHz to\n857 GHz. We further show that the evolution of the MM flux densities are well\nconsistent with our model prediction from an off-axis jet, as was initially\nsuggested from radio and X-ray observations. This detection represents the\nsecond TDE with MM detections; the other is Sw J1644+57, an on-axis jetted TDE\nat redshift of 0.35. Using the on- and off-axis jet models developed for these\ntwo TDEs as templates, we estimate the detection potential of similar events\nwith the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) and the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Assuming an exposure of one hour, we\nfind that the LMT (ALMA) can detect jetted TDEs up to redshifts $z\\sim1$ (2),\nfor a typical disrupted star mass of $\\sim1$ M$_\\odot$. The detection rates of\non- and off-axis TDEs can be as high as $\\sim0.6$ (13) and 10 (220) per year,\nrespectively, for the LMT (ALMA). We briefly discuss how such observations,\ntogether with follow-up radio monitoring, may lead to major advances in\nunderstanding the jetted TDEs themselves and the ambient environment of the\nCNM.\n", "  The impact of energetic electron precipitation (EEP) on the chemistry of the\nmiddle atmosphere (50-90 km) is still an outstanding question as accurate\nquantification of EEP is lacking due to instrumental challenges and\ninsufficient pitch angle coverage of current particle detectors. The Medium\nEnergy Proton and Electron Detectors (MEPED) instrument on board the NOAA/Polar\nOrbiting Environmental Satellites(POES) and MetOp spacecraft has two sets of\nelectron and proton telescopes pointing close to zenith ($0 ^{\\circ}$) and in\nthe horizontal plane ($90 ^{\\circ}$). Using measurements from either the $0\n^{\\circ}$ or $90 ^{\\circ}$ telescope will underestimate or overestimate the\nbounce loss cone flux, respectively, as the energetic electron fluxes are often\nstrongly anisotropic with decreasing fluxes toward the center of the loss cone.\nBy combining the measurements from both telescopes with electron pitch angle\ndistributions from theory of wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, a\ncomplete bounce loss cone flux is constructed for each of the electron energy\nchannels >50 keV, >100 keV, and >300 keV. We apply a correction method to\nremove proton contamination in the electron counts. We also account for the\nrelativistic (>1000 keV) electrons contaminating the proton detector at\nsubauroral latitudes. This gives us full range coverage of electron energies\nthat will be deposited in the middle atmosphere. Finally, we demonstrate the\nmethod's applicability on strongly anisotropic pitch angle distributions during\na weak geomagnetic storm in February 2008. We compare the electron fluxes and\nsubsequent energy deposition estimates to OH observations from the Microwave\nLimb Sounder on the Aura satellite substantiating that the estimated fluxes are\nrepresentative for the true precipitating fluxes impacting the atmosphere.\n", "  --In this article we study the hydrodynamic spectrum of a superfluid confined\nin a cylindrical trap. We show that the dispersion relation $\\omega$(q) of the\nphonon branch scales like $\\sqrt$ q at large q, leading to a vanishingly small\nsuperfluid critical velocity. In practice the critical velocity is set by the\nbreakdown of the hydrodynamic approximation. For a broad class of superfluids,\nthis entails a reduction of the critical velocity by a factor ($\\omega$ $\\perp$\n/\\\"i1/2c) 1/3 with respect to the free-space prediction (here $\\omega$ $\\perp$\nis the trapping frequency and \\\"i1/2c the chemical potential of the cloud).\n", "  We present direct observations of zonal wave numbers 1 and 2 planetary wave\nactivity in the mesopause region derived from a longitudinal chain of\nhigh-latitude Northern Hemisphere (51-66$^{\\circ}$N) Super Dual Auroral Radar\nNetwork radars. Over a 9 year period (2000-2008), the planetary wave activity\nobserved shows a consistent increase around the fall equinox. This is shown to\nbe coincident with a minimum in the magnitude of the stratospheric winds and\nconsequently a minimum in the stratospheric gravity wave filtering and the\nsubsequent momentum deposition in the mesopause region. Despite this, the\nobserved meridional winds are shown to be perturbed poleward and mesopause\ntemperatures rise temporarily, suggesting that westward momentum deposition\nfrom planetary waves temporarily becomes the dominant forcing on the mesopause\nregion each fall equinox.\n", "  In this paper we study a tongue of ionization (TOI) on 31 October 2011 which\nstretched across the polar cap from the Canadian dayside sector to Svalbard in\nthe nightside ionosphere. The TOI front arrived over Svalbard around 1930 UT.\nWe have investigated GPS scintillation and irregularities in relation to this\nTOI front. This is the first study presenting such detailed multi-instrument\ndata of scintillation and irregularities in relation to a TOI front. Combining\ndata from an all-sky imager, the European Incoherent Scatter Svalbard Radar,\nthe Super Dual Auroral Radar Network Hankasalmi radar, and three GPS\nscintillation and total electron content (TEC) monitors in Longyearbyen and\nNy-{\\AA}lesund, we observe bursts of phase scintillation and no amplitude\nscintillation in relation to the leading gradient of the TOI. Spectrograms of\n50 Hz phase measurements show highly localized and variable structuring of the\nTOI leading gradient, with no structuring or scintillation within the TOI or\nahead of the TOI.\n", "  We present three eastward-expanding auroral surge (EEAS) events that were\nobserved intermittently at intervals of about 15 min in the post-midnight\nsector (01:55-02:40 MLT) by all-sky imagers and magnetometers in northern\nEurope. It was deduced that each surge occurred just after each onset of a\nmultiple-onset substorm, which was small-scale and did not clearly expand\nwestward, because they were observed almost simultaneously with Pi 2 pulsations\nat the magnetic equator and magnetic bay variations at middle-to-high latitudes\nassociated with the DP-1 current system. The EEASs showed similar properties to\nomega bands or torches reported in previous studies, such as recurrence\nintervals of about 15 min, concurrence with magnetic pulsations with amplitudes\nof several tens of nanotesla, horizontal scales of 300-400 km, and occurrence\nof a pulsating aurora in a diffuse aurora after the passage of the EEASs.\nFurthermore, the EEASs showed similar temporal evolution to the omega bands,\nduring which eastward-propagating auroral streamers occurred simultaneously in\nthe poleward region, followed by the formation of north-south-aligned auroras,\nwhich eventually connected with the EEASs. Thus, we speculate that EEASs may be\nrelated to the generation process of omega bands. (Continued)\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to study spectral properties of non-self-adjoint\nSchr\\\"odinger operators $-\\Delta-\\frac{(n-2)^2}{4|x|^{2}}+V$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$\nwith complex-valued potentials $V\\in L^{p,\\infty}$, $p>n/2$. We prove Keller\ntype inequalities which measure the radius of a disc containing the discrete\nspectrum, in terms of the $L^{p,\\infty}$ norm of $V$. Similar inequalities also\nhold if the inverse-square potential is replaced by a large class of\nsubcritical potentials with critical singularities at the origin. The main new\ningredient in the proof is the uniform Sobolev inequality of Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge\ntype for Schr\\\"odinger operators with strongly singular potentials, which is of\nindependent interest.\n", "  In this work we examine a nonlinear version of the Jaynes-Cummings model for\ntwo identical two-level atoms allowing for Ising-like and dipole-dipole\ninterplays between them. The model is said to be nonlinear in the sense that it\ncan incorporate both a general intensity-dependent interaction between the\natomic system and the cavity field and/or the presence of a nonlinear medium\ninside the cavity. As an example, we consider a particular type of atom-field\ncoupling based upon the so-called Buck-Sukumar model and a lossless Kerr-like\ncavity. We describe the possible effects of such features on the evolution of\nsome quantities of current interest, such as atomic excitation, purity,\nconcurrence, the entropy of the field and the evolution of the latter in phase\nspace.\n", "  A detailed analysis of Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) terrestrial gamma ray flashes (TGFs) is performed in association with\nWorld Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) sources and very low frequency\n(VLF) sferics recorded at Duke University. RHESSI clock offset is evaluated and\nfound to experience changes on the 5 August 2005 and 21 October 2013, based on\nthe analysis of TGF-WWLLN matches. The clock offsets were found for all three\nperiods of observations with standard deviations less than 100 {\\mu}s. This\nresult opens the possibility for the precise comparative analyses of RHESSI\nTGFs with the other types of data (WWLLN, radio measurements, etc.) In case of\nmultiple-peak TGFs, WWLLN detections are observed to be simultaneous with the\nlast TGF peak for all 16 cases of multipeak RHESSI TGFs simultaneous with WWLLN\nsources. VLF magnetic field sferics were recorded for two of these 16 events at\nDuke University. These radio measurements also attribute VLF sferics to the\nsecond peak of the double TGFs, exhibiting no detectable radio emission during\nthe first TGF peak. Possible scenarios explaining these observations are\nproposed. Double (multipeak) TGFs could help to distinguish between the VLF\nradio emission radiated by the recoil currents in the +IC leader channel and\nthe VLF emission from the TGF producing electrons.\n", "  In this work, we perform a dynamical study of the $B^{(*)}$ and $\\bar K$\ninteraction and show that the newly reported $X(5568)$ or $X(5616)$ cannot be\nassigned to be an isovector $B\\bar{K}$ or $B^*\\bar{K}$ molecular state. We\ncontinue to investigate the isoscalar $B^{(*)}\\bar{K}$ systems, and the\n$B^{(*)}\\bar{K}$ systems with isospin $I=0,1$, and predict the existence of\nseveral isoscalar $B^{(*)}\\bar K^{(*)}$ molecular states. A new task of\nexploring open-bottom molecular states will be created for future experiments.\n", "  Hypothetical existence of other universes gives an opportunity not only to\nextend the scope of physics, but the scope of biology, SETI, and METI as well.\nSome steps of the development of alien life concept shall be briefly\nsummarized, then the multiverse proposal shall be used as a framework of\ninterpretation to introduce an extended taxonomy of possible or at least\nimaginable types of life and intelligence based on either different\nbiochemistry or physics. Some consequences shall be presented about SETI and\nMETI in connection with both multiverse hypothesis and anthropic principle.\n", "  Solar coronal radio bursts are enhanced radio emission excited by energetic\nelectrons accelerated during solar eruptions, studies on which are important\nfor investigating the origin and physical mechanism of energetic particles and\nfurther diagnosing coronal parameters. Earlier studies suffered from a lack of\nsimultaneous high-quality imaging data of the radio burst and the eruptive\nstructure in the inner corona. Here we present a study on a complex solar radio\neruption consisting of a type II and three reversely-drifting type III bursts,\nusing simultaneous EUV and radio imaging data. It is found that the type II\nburst is closely associated with a propagating and evolving CME-driven EUV\nshock structure, originated initially at the northern shock flank and later\ntransferred to the top part of the shock. This source transfer is co-incident\nwith the presence of shock decay and enhancing signatures observed at the\ncorresponding side of the EUV front. The electron energy accelerated by the\nshock at the flank is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.3 c by examining the imaging\ndata of the fast-drifting herringbone structure of the type II burst. The\nreversely-drifting type III sources are found to be within the ejecta and\ncorrelated with a likely reconnection event therein. Implications on further\nobservational studies and relevant space-weather forecasting techniques are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Using a kilojoule class laser, we demonstrate for the first time that\nhigh-contrast picosecond pulses are advantageous for ion acceleration. We show\nthat a laser pulse with optimum duration and a large focal spot accelerates\nelectrons beyond the ponderomotive energy. This anomalous electron heating\nenables efficient ion acceleration reaching 52 MeV at an intensity of 1.2X10^19\nWcm^-2. The proton energy observed agrees quantitatively with a one-dimensional\nplasma expansion model newly developed by taking the anomalous heating effect\ninto account. The heating process is confirmed by both measurements with an\nelectron spectrometer and a one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation. By\nextending the pulse duration to 6 ps, 5% energy conversion efficiency to\nprotons (50 J out of 1 kJ laser energy) is achieved with an intensity of\n10^18-Wcm^-2. The present results are quite encouraging for realizing\nion-driven fast ignition and novel ion beamlines.\n", "  The Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics RelaY (MAORY) is and Adaptive Optics\nmodule to be mounted on the ESO European-Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT). It\nis a hybrid Natural and Laser Guide System that will perform the correction of\nthe atmospheric turbulence volume above the telescope feeding the Multi-AO\nImaging Camera for Deep Observations Near Infrared spectro-imager (MICADO). We\ndeveloped an end-to-end Monte- Carlo adaptive optics simulation tool to\ninvestigate the performance of a the MAORY and the calibration, acquisition,\noperation strategies. MAORY will implement Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics\ncombining Laser Guide Stars (LGS) and Natural Guide Stars (NGS) measurements.\nThe simulation tool implements the various aspect of the MAORY in an end to end\nfashion. The code has been developed using IDL and uses libraries in C++ and\nCUDA for efficiency improvements. Here we recall the code architecture, we\ndescribe the modeled instrument components and the control strategies\nimplemented in the code.\n", "  In this paper we report on the laboratory experiment we settled in the\nShanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) to investigate the pyramid wavefront\nsensor (WFS) ability to measure the differential piston on a sparse aperture.\nThe ultimate goal is to verify the ability of the pyramid WFS work in closed\nloop to perform the phasing of the primary mirrors of a sparse Fizeau imaging\ntelescope. In the experiment we installed on the optical bench we performed\nvarious test checking the ability to flat the wave-front using a deformable\nmirror and to measure the signal of the differential piston on a two pupils\nsetup. These steps represent the background from which we start to perform full\nclosed loop operation on multiple apertures. These steps were also useful to\ncharacterize the achromatic double pyramids (double prisms) manufactured in the\nSHAO optical workshop.\n", "  Dark wavefront sensing in its simplest and more crude form is a quad-cell\nwith a round spot of dark ink acting as occulting disk at the center. This\nsensor exhibits fainter limiting magnitude than a conventional quad-cell,\nproviding that the size of the occulting disk is slightly smaller than the size\nof the spot and smaller than the residual jitter movement in closed loop. We\npresent simulations focusing a generic Adaptive Optics system using Natural\nGuide Stars to provide the tip-tilt signal. We consider a jitter spectrum of\nthe residual correction including amplitudes exceeding the dark disk size.\n", "  Dark wavefront sensing takes shape following quantum mechanics concepts in\nwhich one is able to \"see\" an object in one path of a two-arm interferometer\nusing an as low as desired amount of light actually \"hitting\" the occulting\nobject. A theoretical way to achieve such a goal, but in the realm of wavefront\nsensing, is represented by a combination of two unequal beams interferometer\nsharing the same incoming light, and whose difference in path length is\ncontinuously adjusted in order to show different signals for different signs of\nthe incoming perturbation. Furthermore, in order to obtain this in white light,\nthe path difference should be properly adjusted vs the wavelength used. While\nwe incidentally describe how this could be achieved in a true optomechanical\nsetup, we focus our attention to the simulation of a hypothetical \"perfect\"\ndark wavefront sensor of this kind in which white light compensation is\naccomplished in a perfect manner and the gain is selectable in a numerical\nfashion. Although this would represent a sort of idealized dark wavefront\nsensor that would probably be hard to match in the real glass and metal, it\nwould also give a firm indication of the maximum achievable gain or, in other\nwords, of the prize for achieving such device. Details of how the simulation\ncode works and first numerical results are outlined along with the perspective\nfor an in-depth analysis of the performances and its extension to more\nrealistic situations, including various sources of additional noise.\n", "  The present paper has developed an integro-differential equation to propagate\ncosmological gravitation waves in matter-dominated era in accounting for the\npresence of free streaming neutrinos as a traceless transverse tensor part of\nthe anisotropic stress tensor. Its focus is on short and long wavelengths of\nGWs that enter the horizon in matter-dominated era. Results show that the\nanisotropic stress reduces the squared amplitude by $ 0.03\\%$ for wavelengths,\nentering the horizon during matter-dominated phase. This reduction is less for\nthose wavelengths that enter the horizon at $ \\Lambda $ dominated era in flat\nspacetime. All of the calculations have been done in closed spacetime and the\nresults have been compared with the radiation-dominated case for both flat and\nclosed spacetimes. Finally the paper investigates the effect of closed\nbackground on the amplitude of the gravitational waves.\n", "  We draw attention to the fact that a Hermitian matrix is always\ndiagonalizable and has real discrete spectrum whereas the Hermitian\nSchr{\\\"o}dinger Hamiltonian: $H=p^2/2\\mu+V(x)$, may not be so. For instance\nwhen $V(x)=x, x^3, -x^2$, $H$ does not have even one real discrete eigenvalue.\nTextbooks do not highlight this distinction. However, if $H$ has real discrete\nspectrum, by virtue of the expansion theorem, one can convert the eigenvalue\nproblem $H\\psi_n=E_n \\psi_n$ into a matrix and get eigenvalues $E_n$ by\ndiagonalizing the matrix. We show, that the thus obtained $E_n$ could be\naccurate, provided $H$ is devoid of scattering states. We suggest that this\ncould be a simple and apt way to introduce the method of Linear Combination of\nAtomic Orbitals (LCAO) for finding the spectra of molecules. In textbooks,\nusually the method of matrix-diagonalization appears meagerly as a degenerate\nperturbation theory for more than one dimensions.\n", "  The disappearance of reactor $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ observed by the Daya Bay\nexperiment is examined in the framework of a model in which the neutrino is\ndescribed by a wave packet with a relative intrinsic momentum dispersion\n$\\sigma_\\text{rel}$. Three pairs of nuclear reactors and eight antineutrino\ndetectors, each with good energy resolution, distributed among three\nexperimental halls, supply a high-statistics sample of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ acquired\nat nine different baselines. This provides a unique platform to test the\neffects which arise from the wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillation. The\nmodified survival probability formula was used to fit Daya Bay data, providing\nthe first experimental limits: $2.38 \\cdot 10^{-17} < \\sigma_{\\rm rel} < 0.23$.\nTreating the dimensions of the reactor cores and detectors as constraints, the\nlimits are improved: $10^{-14} \\lesssim \\sigma_{\\rm rel} < 0.23$, and an upper\nlimit of $\\sigma_{\\rm rel} <0.20$ is obtained. All limits correspond to a 95\\%\nC.L. Furthermore, the effect due to the wave packet nature of neutrino\noscillation is found to be insignificant for reactor antineutrinos detected by\nthe Daya Bay experiment thus ensuring an unbiased measurement of the\noscillation parameters $\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{32}$ within the\nplane wave model.\n", "  We have developed a Green-Kubo relation that enables accurate calculations of\nfriction at solid-liquid interfaces directly from equilibrium molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations and that provides a pathway to bypass the time-scale\nlimitations of typical nonequilibrium MD simulations. The theory has been\nvalidated for a number of different interfaces and it is demonstrated that the\nliquid-solid slip is an intrinsic property of an interface. Because of the high\nnumerical efficiency of our method, it can be used in the design of interfaces\nfor applications in aqueous environments, such as nano- and microfluidics.\n", "  The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) first light instrument IRIS (Infrared\nImaging Spectrograph) will complete its preliminary design phase in 2016. The\nIRIS instrument design includes a near-infrared (0.85 - 2.4 micron) integral\nfield spectrograph (IFS) and imager that are able to conduct simultaneous\ndiffraction-limited observations behind the advanced adaptive optics system\nNFIRAOS. The IRIS science cases have continued to be developed and new science\nstudies have been investigated to aid in technical performance and design\nrequirements. In this development phase, the IRIS science team has paid\nparticular attention to the selection of filters, gratings, sensitivities of\nthe entire system, and science cases that will benefit from the parallel mode\nof the IFS and imaging camera. We present new science cases for IRIS using the\nlatest end-to-end data simulator on the following topics: Solar System bodies,\nthe Galactic center, active galactic nuclei (AGN), and distant\ngravitationally-lensed galaxies. We then briefly discuss the necessity of an\nadvanced data management system and data reduction pipeline.\n", "  The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is the first focusing high\nenergy (3-79 keV) X-ray observatory operating for four years from low Earth\norbit. The X-ray detector arrays are located on the spacecraft bus with the\noptics modules mounted on a flexible mast of 10.14m length. The motion of the\ntelescope optical axis on the detectors during each observation is measured by\na laser metrology system and matches the pre-launch predictions of the thermal\nflexing of the mast as the spacecraft enters and exits the Earths shadow each\norbit. However, an additional motion of the telescope field of view was\ndiscovered during observatory commissioning that is associated with the\nspacecraft attitude control system and an additional flexing of the mast\ncorrelated with the Solar aspect angle for the observation. We present the\nmethodology developed to predict where any particular target coordinate will\nfall on the NuSTAR detectors based on the Solar aspect angle at the scheduled\ntime of an observation. This may be applicable to future observatories that\nemploy optics deployed on extendable masts. The automation of the prediction\nsystem has greatly improved observatory operations efficiency and the\nreliability of observation planning.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study frictional slip\nand its influence on energy dissipation and momentum transfer at atomically\nsmooth solid/water interfaces. By modifying surface chemistry, we investigate\nthe relationship between slip and the mechanical response of a vibrating solid\nfor both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. We discover physical phenomena\nthat emerge at high frequencies and that have significant contributions to\nenergy dissipation. A new analytical model is developed to describe mechanical\nresponse of the resonators in this high frequency regime, which is relevant in\nsuch applications as MEMS-based biosensors. We find a linear relationship\nbetween the slip length and the ratio of the damping rate shift to resonant\nfrequency shift, which provides a new way to obtain information about slip\nlength from experiments.\n", "  Fundamental studies of the effect of specific ions on hydrophobic\ninteractions are driven by the need to understand phenomena such as\nhydrophobically driven self-assembly or protein folding. Using\nbeta-peptide-inspired nano-rods, we investigate the effects of both free ions\n(dissolved salts) and proximally immobilized ions on hydrophobic interactions.\nWe find that the free ion effect is correlated with the water density\nfluctuation near a non-polar molecular surface, showing that such fluctuation\ncan be an indicator of hydrophobic interactions in the case of solution\nadditives. In the case of immobilized ion, our results demonstrate that\nhydrophobic interactions can be switched on and off by choosing different\nspatial arrangements of proximal ions on a nano-rod. For globally amphiphilic\nnano-rods, we find that the magnitude of the interaction can be further tuned\nusing proximal ions with varying ionic sizes. In general, univalent proximal\nanions are found to weaken hydrophobic interactions. This is in contrast to the\neffect of free ions, which according to our simulations strengthen hydrophobic\ninteractions. In addition, immobilized anions of increasing ionic size do not\nfollow the same ordering (Hofmeister-like ranking) as free ions when it comes\nto their impact on hydrophobic interactions. The immobilized ion effect is not\nsimply correlated with the water density fluctuation near the non-polar side of\nthe amphiphilic nano-rod. We propose a molecular picture that explains the\ncontrasting effects of immobilized versus free ions.\n", "  The concept of city or urban resilience has emerged as one of the key\nchallenges for the next decades. As a consequence, institutions like the United\nNations or Rockefeller Foundation have embraced initiatives that increase or\nimprove it. These efforts translate into funded programs both for action on the\nground and to develop quantification of resilience, under the for of an index.\nIronically, on the academic side there is no clear consensus regarding how\nresilience should be quantified, or what it exactly refers to in the urban\ncontext. Here we attempt to link both extremes providing an example of how to\nexploit large, publicly available, worldwide urban datasets, to produce\nobjective insight into one of the possible dimensions of urban resilience. We\ndo so via well-established methods in complexity science, such as percolation\ntheory --which has a long tradition at providing valuable information on the\nvulnerability in complex systems. Our findings uncover large differences among\nstudied cities, both regarding their infrastructural fragility and the\nimbalances in the distribution of critical services.\n", "  By using the functional path integral method, we obtain a model-independent\nformula for nuclear symmetry energy, which explicitly shows the relation\nbetween nuclear symmetry energy and isospin susceptibility. The latter one is\nfound to be a probe to the QCD chiral phase transition. We further found that,\nthe nuclear symmetry energy has an abrupt change at the critical nuclear\ndensity where the chiral symmetry restores partially, which could be detected\nfrom the experiments.\n", "  The Mayan culture collected exquisite astronomical data for over a\nmillennium. However, it failed to come up with the breakthrough ideas of modern\nastronomy because the data was analyzed within a mythological culture of\nastrology that rested upon false but mathematically sophisticated theories\nabout the Universe. Have we learned the necessary lessons to prevent our\ncurrent scientific culture from resembling Mayan Astronomy? Clearly, data\ncollection by itself is not a guarantee for good science as commonly assumed by\nfunding agencies. A vibrant scientific culture should cultivate multiple\napproaches to analyzing existing data and to collecting new data.\n", "  In this piece of work, an important transition from amplitude death (AD) to\noscillation death (OD) state in coupled Chua circuit has been explored for the\nfirst time. Here, mean field diffusively (MFD) coupled Chua circuits are when\nadditionally coupled through direct coupling, it exhibits the AD-OD transition\nphenomena. The effect of design parameters and coupling parameters are\ninvestigated in details. For both identical and non-identical systems the AD\nmake transition to OD through symmetry breaking. These are investigated through\nnumerical simulations and are established through hardware experiment. The\npresent study includes a new dimension to versatility of Chua circuit in the\nfield of nonlinear dynamics.\n", "  This paper proposes the use of graph pattern matching for investigative graph\nsearch, which is the process of searching for and prioritizing persons of\ninterest who may exhibit part or all of a pattern of suspicious behaviors or\nconnections. While there are a variety of applications, our principal\nmotivation is to aid law enforcement in the detection of homegrown violent\nextremists. We introduce investigative simulation, which consists of several\nnecessary extensions to the existing dual simulation graph pattern matching\nscheme in order to make it appropriate for intelligence analysts and law\nenforcement officials. Specifically, we impose a categorical label structure on\nnodes consistent with the nature of indicators in investigations, as well as\nprune or complete search results to ensure sensibility and usefulness of\npartial matches to analysts. Lastly, we introduce a natural top-k ranking\nscheme that can help analysts prioritize investigative efforts. We demonstrate\nperformance of investigative simulation on a real-world large dataset.\n", "  We perform a thorough study of various characteristics of the asynchronous\npush-pull protocol for spreading a rumor on Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs\n$G_{n,p}$, for any $p>c\\ln(n)/n$ with $c>1$. In particular, we provide a simple\nstrategy for analyzing the asynchronous push-pull protocol on arbitrary graph\ntopologies and apply this strategy to $G_{n,p}$. We prove tight bounds of\nlogarithmic order for the total time that is needed until the information has\nspread to all nodes. Surprisingly, the time required by the asynchronous\npush-pull protocol is asymptotically almost unaffected by the average degree of\nthe graph. Similarly tight bounds for Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs have\npreviously only been obtained for the synchronous push protocol, where it has\nbeen observed that the total running time increases significantly for sparse\nrandom graphs. Finally, we quantify the robustness of the protocol with respect\nto transmission and node failures. Our analysis suggests that the asynchronous\nprotocols are particularly robust with respect to these failures compared to\ntheir synchronous counterparts.\n", "  Community detection is a fundamental task in social network analysis. In this\npaper, first we develop an endorsement filtered user connectivity network by\nutilizing Heider's structural balance theory and certain Twitter triad\npatterns. Next, we develop three Nonnegative Matrix Factorization frameworks to\ninvestigate the contributions of different types of user connectivity and\ncontent information in community detection. We show that user content and\nendorsement filtered connectivity information are complementary to each other\nin clustering politically motivated users into pure political communities. Word\nusage is the strongest indicator of users' political orientation among all\ncontent categories. Incorporating user-word matrix and word similarity\nregularizer provides the missing link in connectivity only methods which suffer\nfrom detection of artificially large number of clusters for Twitter networks.\n", "  We report the observation of conventional superconductivity at the highest\ntemperature yet attained without mechanical compression, around 54 kelvin in\npalladium-hydride and 60 kelvin in palladium-deuteride. The remarkable increase\nin Tc compared to the previously known value was achieved by rapidly cooling\nthe hydride and deuteride after loading with hydrogen or deuterium at elevated\ntemperature. Our results encourage hope that conventional superconductivity\nunder ambient conditions will be discovered in materials with very high\nhydrogen density, as predicted more than a decade ago.\n", "  High critical temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in copper oxides\nemerges when Mott insulators are doped, and various unconventional properties\nfollow. Among them, a focus is the so-called pseudogap behaviour emerging above\nTc, which is discussed in association with competing orders, Fermi-arc and\npreformed Cooper pairs. Besides doping, there is another way to generate\nunconventional superconductivity from Mott insulators, that is, by bandwidth\ncontrol, which involves varying the particle's kinetic energy instead of\nparticle number. Here, working with layered organic superconductors through NMR\nexperiments, we uncover that in the non-doped case anomalous suppression of\nspin excitations above Tc arises from the preformed Cooper pairs intertwined\nwith antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations and is not accompanied by complexities\nof competing orders, unlike what is observed in copper oxides. On the verge of\nthe Mott localization of electrons, they preform Cooper pairs that persist up\nto twice as high as Tc.\n", "  In this paper we present an approach for forecasting the imminent regional\nseismic activity by using geomagnetic data and Earth tide data. The time\nperiods of seismic activity are the time periods around the Sun-Moon extreme of\nthe diurnal average value of the tide vector module. For analyzing the\ngeomagnetic data behaviour we use diurnal standard deviation of geomagnetic\nvector components F for calculating the time variance Geomag Signal. The Sun\nstorm influence is avoided by using data for daily A-indexes (published by\nNOAA). The precursor signal for forecasting the incoming regional seismic\nactivity is a simple function of the present and previous day Geomag Signal and\nA-indexes values. The reliability of the geomagnetic when, regional precursor\nis demonstrated by using statistical analysis of day difference between the\ntimes of predicted and occurred earthquakes. The base of the analysis is a\nnatural hypothesis that the predicted earthquake is the one whose surface\nenergy density in the monitoring point is bigger than the energy densities of\nall occurred earthquakes in the same period and region. The reliability of the\napproach was tested using the INTERMAGNET stations data located in Bulgaria,\nPanagurishte, PAG (Jan 1, 2008-Jan 29, 2014), Romania, Surlari, SUA (Jan 1,\n2008-Jan 27, 2014), Italy, L'Aquila, AQU (Jan 1, 2008-May 30, 2013) in the time\nof EU IRSES BlackSeaHazNet (2011-2014) project. The steps of program for\nsolving the when, where and how earthquake prediction problem are shortly\ndescribed.\n", "  The large-N behavior of the quartic-cubic generalized two dimensional\nYang-Mills U(N) on the sphere is investigated for finite cubic couplings.\nFirst, it is shown that there are two phase transitions one of which is third\norder and the other one is second order. Second, $gYM_2$ and Maxwell\nconstruction are compared and a relationship between two-dimensional\nspace-time, that is purely mathematical, and four-dimensional space-time is\nobtained.\n", "  The phenomenon of superradiance in the context of asymptotically global AdS\nspacetimes is investigated with particular accent on its effect on the\nstability of the systems under consideration. To this end, the concept of an\nasymptotically AdS spacetime is explained, together with its implications on\nthe boundary conditions at $\\mathcal{I}$, as well as the\nNewman-Penrose-Teukolsky formalism, whereby the Teukolsky master equation in a\nmost general form for Kerr-AdS is given. Furthermore, work done in the cases of\nRN-AdS and Kerr-AdS is laid out in a concise manner, putting emphasis on the\nimportant steps taken in determining the endpoint of the superradiant\ninstability in the two configurations. For the former this turns out to be a\nblack hole with reduced charge and a static charged scalar condensate around\nit, whereas for the latter two of the more probable outcomes are presented,\nboth of which imply a violation of one of the cosmic censorships.\n", "  We study the phase transion line of the almost Mathieu operator, that\nseparates arithmetic regions corresponding to singular continuous and a.e. pure\npoint regimes, and prove that both purely singular continuous and a.e. pure\npoint spectrum occur for dense sets of frequencies.\n", "  We describe a new method to perform NLO calculations, combining real and\nvirtual amplitudes at the integrand level, with a fully local compensation\nbetween them in the IR, and between the virtual integrand and properly defined\ncounter-terms in the UV, in such a way that physical observables can be\ncomputed in 4 dimensions. One of the advantages of the method is that all the\nscattering amplitudes are integrated simultaneously, without the need for\ntensor reduction, or projection onto sets of master integrals. As such, it\ncould offer great progress in the automation of NLO calculations, where the\nactual bottle-necks are the complexity of the analytical calculations for\nmulti-leg processes, and the numerical stability of the result.\n", "  We investigate a family of peakon equations, labelled by two parameters $b$\nand $\\kappa$, all of which admit one-peakon solutions in a unified form. The\nwell known Camassa-Holm equation and Degasperis-Procesi equation are derived\nfrom the b-family peakon equations by choosing $b=2$ and 3, respectively. For\nall values of $b$, their two peakon-type solutions are shown in difference form\nand in weak sense. At the same time, the dynamic behaviors are shown in\ndifference phenomenons, such as the peaked waves collide elastically in the\ncase $b=2$, while the peaked waves collide inelastically in other cases.\n", "  We propose a wavefront-based method to estimate the PSF over the whole field\nof view. This method estimate the aberrations of all the mirrors of the\ntelescope using only field stars. In this proof of concept paper, we described\nthe method and present some qualitative results.\n", "  Massive galaxy clusters with cool-cores typically host diffuse radio sources\ncalled mini-haloes, whereas, those with non-cool-cores host radio haloes. We\nattempt to understand the unusual nature of the cool-core galaxy cluster\nCL1821+643 that hosts a Mpc-scale radio halo using new radio observations and\nmorphological analysis of its intra-cluster medium. We present the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) 610 MHz image of the radio halo. The spectral\nindex, $\\alpha$ defined as $S\\propto \\nu^{-\\alpha}$, of the radio halo is\n$1.0\\pm0.1$ over the frequency range of 323 - 610 - 1665 MHz. Archival {\\it\nChandra} X-ray data were used to make surface brightness and temperature maps.\nThe morphological parameters Gini, $M_{20}$ and concentration ($C$) were\ncalculated on X-ray surface brightness maps by including and excluding the\ncentral quasar (H1821+643) in the cluster. We find that the cluster CL1821+643,\nexcluding the quasar, is a non-relaxed cluster as seen in the morphological\nparameter planes. It occupies the same region as other merging radio halo\nclusters in the temperature- morphology parameter plane. We conclude that this\ncluster has experienced a non-core-disruptive merger.\n", "  We compare the entropy-energy inequality and the von Neumann entropic\ninequality for three level atom implemented on superconducting circuits with\nJosephson junction. The positivity of entropy and energy relations for the\nqutrit system are used for verification of state tomography of qudit systems.\nThe results obtained are valid for generic quantum states (qudits) and are\nillustrated on the example of the temperature density matrix of the single\nqutrit state.\n", "  We discuss a number of FORM features that are essential in the automatic\nprocessing of very large numbers of diagrams as used in the Forcer program for\n4-loop massless propagator diagrams. Most of these features are new.\n", "  A background of nanohertz gravitational waves from supermassive black hole\nbinaries could soon be detected by pulsar timing arrays, which measure the\ntimes-of-arrival of radio pulses from millisecond pulsars with very high\nprecision. The European Pulsar Timing Array uses five large European radio\ntelescopes to monitor high-precision millisecond pulsars, imposing in this way\nstrong constraints on a gravitational wave background. To achieve the necessary\nprecision needed to detect gravitational waves, the Large European Array for\nPulsars (LEAP) performs simultaneous observations of pulsars with all five\ntelescopes, which allows us to coherently add the radio pulses, maximize the\nsignal-to-noise of pulsar signals and increase the precision of\ntimes-of-arrival. We report on the progress made and results obtained by the\nLEAP collaboration, and in particular on the addition of the Sardinia Radio\nTelescope to the LEAP observations during its scientific validation phase. In\naddition, we discuss how LEAP can be used to monitor strong-gravity systems\nsuch as double neutron star systems and impose strong constraints on\npost-keplerian parameters.\n", "  Social networks require active relationship maintenance if they are to be\nkept at a constant level of emotional closeness. For primates, including\nhumans, failure to interact leads inexorably to a decline in relationship\nquality, and a consequent loss of the benefits that derive from individual\nrelationships. As a result, many social species compensate for weakened\nrelationships by investing more heavily in them. Here we study how humans\nbehave in similar situations, using data from mobile call detail records from a\nEuropean country. For the less frequent contacts between pairs of communicating\nindividuals we observe a logarithmic dependence of the duration of the\nsucceeding call on the time gap with the previous call. We find that such\nbehaviour is likely when the individuals in these dyadic pairs have the same\ngender and are in the same age bracket as well as being geographically distant.\nOur results indicate that these pairs deliberately invest more time in\ncommunication so as to reinforce their social bonding and prevent their\nrelationships decaying when these are threatened by lack of interaction.\n", "  We discuss the appearance of Jacobi automorphic forms in the theory of\nsuperconformal vertex algebras, explaining it by way of supercurves and formal\ngeometry. We touch on related topics such as Ramanujan's differential equations\nfor Eisenstein series.\n", "  We investigate the solutions of the second-order difference equation\n$u_{n+2}=(au_n)/(1+bu_nu_{n+1})$ using a group of transformations (Lie\nsymmetries) that leaves the solutions invariant.\n", "  We summarize the current top quark mass ($m_t$) measurements from the CDF and\nD0 experiments at Fermilab. We combine published results from Run I\n(1992--1996) with the most precise published and preliminary Run II\n(2001--2011) measurements based on $p\\bar{p}$ data corresponding to up to\n$9.7\\:{\\rm fb}^{-1}$ of $p\\bar{p}$ collisions. Taking correlations of\nuncertainties into account, and combining the statistical and systematic\ncontributions in quadrature, the preliminary Tevatron average mass value for\nthe top quark is $m_t = 174.30 \\ \\pm 0.65\\:\\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}$, corresponding\nto a relative precision of $0.37\\%$\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate far-field acoustic superresolution using shaped\nacoustic vortices. Compared with previously proposed near-field methods of\nacoustic superresolution, in this work we describe how far-field\nsuperresolution can be obtained using an acoustic vortex wave antenna. This is\naccomplished by leveraging the recent advances in optical vortices in\nconjunction with the topological diversity of a leaky wave antenna design. In\nparticular, the use of an acoustic vortex wave antenna eliminates the need for\na complicated phased array consisting of multiple active elements, and enables\na superresolving aperture to be achieved with a single simple acoustic source\nand total aperture size less than a wavelength in diameter. A theoretical\nformulation is presented for the design of an acoustic vortex wave antenna with\narbitrary planar arrangement, and explicit expressions are developed for the\nradiated acoustic pressure field. This geometric versatility enables\nvariously-shaped acoustic vortex patterns to be achieved, which propagate from\nthe near-field into the far-field through an arrangement of stable integer mode\nvortices. Two examples are presented and discussed in detail, illustrating the\ngeneration and transmission of an \"X\" and \"Y\" shape into the far-field. Despite\nthe total aperture size being less than a wavelength in diameter, the proposed\nacoustic vortex wave antenna is shown to achieve far-field superresolution with\nfeature sizes 4-9 times smaller than the resolution limit.\n", "  Two aspects of conductive heat are focused here (i) the nature of conductive\nheat, defined as that form of energy that is transferred as a result of a\ntemperature difference and (ii) the nature of the intermolecular potentials\nthat induces both thermal energy flow and the temperature profile at the steady\nstate for a 1-D lattice chain. It is found that the standard presuppositions of\npeople like Benofy and Quay (BQ) following Joseph Fourier do not obtain for at\nleast a certain specified regime of intermolecular potential parameters related\nto harmonic (quadratic) potentials for nearest neighbor interactions. For these\nharmonic potentials, it appears from the simulation results that steady state\nsolutions exist utilizing non-synthetic thermostats that couple not just the\ntwo particles at the extreme ends of the lattice chain, but to a control volume\nof $N$ particles located at either ends of the chain that does not accord with\nthe unique analytical solutions that obtains for single particle thermostatting\nat the ends of the lattice with a different thermostatting algorithm that\nutilizes coupling coefficients. If the method used here is considered a more\n\"realistic\" or feasible model of the physical reality, then a re-evaluation of\nsome aspects of the standard theoretical methodology is warranted since the\nstandard model solution profile does not accord with the simulation temperature\nprofile determined here for this related model. We also note that the\nsinusoidal temperature profile generated suggests that thermal integrated\ncircuits with several thermal P-N junctions may be constructed, opening a way\nto create more complex thermal transistor circuits. A stationary principle is\nproposed for regions that violate the Fourier principle $\\mathbf{J_q.}\\nabla T\n\\le 0 $, where $\\mathbf{J_q}$ is the heat current vector and $T$ the\ntemperature.\n", "  In contrast to the commonly used lattice Boltzmann method, off-lattice\nBoltzmann methods decouple the velocity discretization from the underlying\nspatial grid, thus allowing for more efficient geometric representations of\ncomplex boundaries. The current work combines characteristic-based integration\nof the streaming step with the free-energy based multiphase model by Lee et.\nal. [Journal of Computational Physics, 206 (1), 2005 ]. This allows for\nsimulation time steps more than an order of magnitude larger than the\nrelaxation time. Unlike previous work by Wardle et. al. [Computers and\nMathematics with Applications, 65 (2), 2013 ] that integrated intermolecular\nforcing terms in the advection term, the current scheme applies collision and\nforcing terms locally for a simpler finite element formulation. A series of\nthorough benchmark studies reveal that this does not compromise stability and\nthat the scheme is able to accurately simulate flows at large density and\nviscosity contrasts.\n", "  We probe the existence of large correlated non-Gaussian phase fluctuations in\nthe vicinity of the superconducting phase transition in the conducting layer\nresiding at the interface of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. The\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations appear between the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition temperature $T_{BKT}$ and the mean field transition temperature\n$T_C$. Subsequent theoretical analysis reveals that non-Gaussianity arises\npredominantly due to the percolative transition of a Josephson coupled network\nof superconductors. Our results confirm that the superconductivity in this\nsystem is confined to two-dimensions. Our study of the non-Gaussian resistance\nfluctuation spectrum provides a novel means to explore the BKT-transition in\ntwo-dimensional inhomogeneous superconductors.\n", "  Extending the scalar sector helps in studying the Higgs mechanism and some\nStandard Model problems.\n  We implement the correspondence between the gauge-dependent elementary states\nand the non-perturbative non-abelian gauge-invariant asymptotic states,\nnecessary to study the non-perturbative phenomenology of two-Higgs-doublet\nmodels.\n  The Flavour and CP violation in experimental data follows a hierarchical\npattern, accounted by the Standard Model. We define the Minimal Flavour\nViolation condition with six spurions in effective field theories, implying\nFlavour and CP violation entirely dependent on the fermion mixing matrices but\nindependent of the fermion masses hierarchy; it is renormalization-group\ninvariant.\n  We study the phenomenology of renormalizable two-Higgs-doublet models which\nverify the defined condition as consequence of a symmetry; new light physical\nscalars, mediating Flavour Changing Neutral Currents, are allowed by flavour\ndata without flavour coefficients beyond the Standard Model; we tested the\nmodels with C++ libraries linked by the symbolic skills of the GiNaC library\nand we propose more libraries supporting a systematic search for Flavour\nChanging Neutral Currents.\n  We also map the complex to the real Poincare group representations, derive\nthe free Dirac equation requiring covariant localizability of the\nrepresentations and study Localization and gauge symmetries in Quantum Field\nTheory.\n", "  Eight X-ray observations of V4743 Sgr (2002), observed with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton are presented. The nova turned off some time between days 301.9 and\n371, and the X-ray flux subsequently decreased from day 301.9 to 526 following\nan exponential decline time scale of $(96 \\pm 3)$ days. We use the absorption\nlines present in the SSS spectrum for diagnostic purposes, and characterize the\nphysics and the dynamics of the expanding atmosphere during the explosion of\nthe nova. The information extracted from this first stage is then used as input\nfor computing full photoionization models of the ejecta in V4743 Sgr. The SSS\nspectrum is modeled with a simple black-body and multiplicative Gaussian lines,\nwhich provides us of a general kinematical picture of the system, before it\ndecays to its faint phase (Ness et al. 2003). In the grating spectra taken\nbetween days 180.4 and 370, we can resolve the line profiles of absorption\nlines arising from H-like and He-like C, N, and O, including transitions\ninvolving higher principal quantum numbers. Except for a few interstellar\nlines, all lines are significantly blue-shifted, yielding velocities between\n1000 and 6000 km/s which implies an ongoing mass loss. It is shown that\nsignificant expansion and mass loss occur during this phase of the explosion,\nat a rate $\\dot{M} \\approx (3-5) \\times 10^{-4} ~ (\\frac{L}{L_{38}}) ~\nM_{\\odot}/yr$. Our measurements show that the efficiency of the amount of\nenergy used for the motion of the ejecta, defined as the ratio between the\nkinetic luminosity $L_{\\rm kin}$ and the radiated luminosity $L_{\\rm rad}$, is\nof the order of one.\n", "  We report on the performance of the statistical, X-ray absorption lines\nidentification procedure XLINE-ID. As illustration, it is used to estimate the\ntime averaged gas density $n_H(r)$ of a representative AGN's warm absorber\n($T\\approx 10^5$~K) X-ray simulated spectrum. The method relies on three key\ningredients: (1) a well established emission continuum level; (2) a robust grid\nof photoionisation models spanning several orders of magnitude in gas density\n($n_H$), plasma column density ($N_H$), and in ionization states; (3)\ntheoretical curves of growth for a large set of atomic lines. By comparing\ntheoretical and observed equivalent widths of a large set of lines, spanning\nhighly ionized charge states from O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, and the Fe L-shell and\nK-shell, we are able to infer the location of the X-ray warm absorber.\n", "  Predictive models for human mobility have important applications in many\nfields such as traffic control, ubiquitous computing and contextual\nadvertisement. The predictive performance of models in literature varies quite\nbroadly, from as high as 93% to as low as under 40%. In this work we\ninvestigate which factors influence the accuracy of next-place prediction,\nusing a high-precision location dataset of more than 400 users for periods\nbetween 3 months and one year. We show that it is easier to achieve high\naccuracy when predicting the time-bin location than when predicting the next\nplace. Moreover we demonstrate how the temporal and spatial resolution of the\ndata can have strong influence on the accuracy of prediction. Finally we\nuncover that the exploration of new locations is an important factor in human\nmobility, and we measure that on average 20-25% of transitions are to new\nplaces, and approx. 70% of locations are visited only once. We discuss how\nthese mechanisms are important factors limiting our ability to predict human\nmobility.\n", "  We proposed a method to achieve superresolved optical imaging without beating\nthe diffraction limit of light. This is achieved by magnifying the ideal\noptical image of the object through higher-order spatial frequency generation\nwhile keeping the size of the effective point spread function of the optical\nimaging system unchanged. A proof-of-principle experiment was demonstrated in a\nmodified $4f$-imaging system, where the spatial frequency of a two-line source\nwas doubled or tripled on the confocal Fourier plane of the $4f$-imaging system\nthrough a light pulse storage and retrieval process based on the\nelectromagnetically induced transparency effect in a Pr$^{3+}$:$\\rm Y_2SiO_5$\ncrystal, and an originally unresolvable image of the two line sources in the\nconventional $4f$-imaging system became resolvable with the spatial frequency\ndoubling or tripling. Our results offer an original way towards improving\noptical imaging resolution without beating the diffraction limit of light,\nwhich is totally different from the existing superresolution methods to\novercome the diffraction limit.\n", "  We prove that the electronic density of states (DOS) for 2D incommensurate\nlayered structures, where Bloch theory does not apply, is well-defined as the\nthermodynamic limit of finite clusters. In addition, we obtain an explicit\nrepresentation formula for the DOS as an integral over local configurations.\nNext, based on this representation formula, we propose a novel algorithm for\ncomputing electronic structure properties in incommensurate heterostructures,\nwhich overcomes limitations of the common approach to artificially strain a\nlarge supercell and then apply Bloch theory.\n", "  I derive formulas for the real space CMB temperature and polarization by\nsolving the first order Boltzmann equation for the Stokes parameters I, Q and\nU.\n", "  Collective intelligence is believed to underly the remarkable success of\nhuman society. The formation of accurate shared beliefs is one of the key\ncomponents of human collective intelligence. How are accurate shared beliefs\nformed in groups of fallible individuals? Answering this question requires a\nmultiscale analysis. We must understand both the individual decision mechanisms\npeople use, and the properties and dynamics of those mechanisms in the\naggregate. As of yet, mathematical tools for such an approach have been\nlacking. To address this gap, we introduce a new analytical framework: We\npropose that groups arrive at accurate shared beliefs via distributed Bayesian\ninference. Distributed inference occurs through information processing at the\nindividual level, and yields rational belief formation at the group level. We\ninstantiate this framework in a new model of human social decision-making,\nwhich we validate using a dataset we collected of over 50,000 users of an\nonline social trading platform where investors mimic each others' trades using\nreal money in foreign exchange and other asset markets. We find that in this\nsetting people use a decision mechanism in which popularity is treated as a\nprior distribution for which decisions are best to make. This mechanism is\nboundedly rational at the individual level, but we prove that in the aggregate\nimplements a type of approximate \"Thompson sampling\"---a well-known and highly\neffective single-agent Bayesian machine learning algorithm for sequential\ndecision-making. The perspective of distributed Bayesian inference therefore\nreveals how collective rationality emerges from the boundedly rational decision\nmechanisms people use.\n", "  The Outer Space Treaty makes it clear that the Moon is the province of all\nmankind, with the latter ordinarily understood to exclude state or private\nappropriation of any portion of its surface. However, there are indeterminacies\nin the Treaty and in space law generally over the issue of appropriation. These\nindeterminacies might permit a close approximation to a property claim or some\nmanner of quasi-property. The recently revealed highly inhomogeneous\ndistribution of lunar resources changes the context of these issues. We\nillustrate this altered situation by considering the Peaks of Eternal Light.\nThey occupy about one square kilometer of the lunar surface. We consider a\nthought experiment in which a Solar telescope is placed on one of the Peaks of\nEternal Light at the lunar South pole for scientific research. Its operation\nwould require nondisturbance, and hence that the Peak remain unvisited by\nothers, effectively establishing a claim of protective exclusion and de facto\nappropriation. Such a telescope would be relatively easy to emplace with todays\ntechnology and so poses a near-term property issue on the Moon. While effective\nappropriation of a Peak might proceed without raising some of the familiar\nproblems associated with commercial development (especially lunar mining), the\npossibility of such appropriation nonetheless raises some significant issues\nconcerning justice and the safeguarding of scientific practice on the lunar\nsurface. We consider this issue from scientific, technical, ethical and policy\nviewpoints.\n", "  A theory of anyon excitons consisting of a valence hole and three\nquasielectrons with electric charges $(-e/3)$ is presented. A full symmetry\nclassification of the $k=0$ states is given, where $k$ is the exciton momentum.\nThe energy levels of these states are expressed by quadratures of confluent\nhypergeometric functions. It is shown that the angular momentum $L$ of the\nexciton ground state depends on the distance between electron and hole\nconfinement planes and takes the values $L=3n$, where $n$ is an integer. With\nincreasing $k$ the electron density shows a spectacular splitting on bundles.\nAt first a single anyon splits off of the two-anyon core, and finally all\nanyons become separated.\n", "  The pair coherent states for a two-mode radiation field are known to belong\nto a family of states with non-Gaussian wave function. The nature of quantum\nentanglement between the two modes and some features of non-classicality are\nstudied for such states. The existing criteria for inseparability are examined\nin the context of pair coherent states.\n", "  There are several examples of bipartite entangled states of continuous\nvariables for which the existing criteria for entanglement using the\ninequalities involving the second order moments are insufficient. We derive new\ninequalities involving higher order correlation, for testing entanglement in\nnon-Gaussian states. In this context we study an example of a non-Gaussian\nstate, which is a bipartite entangled state of the form $\\psi(x_{\\rm a},x_{\\rm\nb})\\propto (\\alpha x_{\\rm a}+\\beta x_{\\rm b})e^{-(x_{\\rm a}^2+x_{\\rm b}^2)/2}$.\nOur results open up an avenue to search for new inequalities to test\nentanglement in non-Gaussian states.\n", "  We show how the entanglement in a wide range of continuous variable\nnon-Gaussian states can be preserved against decoherence for long-range quantum\ncommunication through an optical fiber. We apply protection via\ndecoherence-free subspaces and quantum dynamical decoupling to this end. The\nlatter is implemented by inserting phase shifters at regular intervals $\\Delta\n$ inside the fiber, where $\\Delta $ is roughly the ratio of the speed of light\nin the fiber to the bath high-frequency cutoff. Detailed estimates of relevant\nparameters are provided using the boson-boson model of system-bath interaction\nfor silica fibers, and $\\Delta $ is found to be on the order of a millimeter.\n", "  We discuss nonclassical properties of single-photon subtracted squeezed\nvacuum states in terms of the sub-Poissonian statistics and the negativity of\nthe Wigner function. We derive a compact expression for the Wigner function\nfrom which we find the region of phase space where Wigner function is negative.\nWe find an upper bound on the squeezing parameter for the state to exhibit\nsub-Poissonian statistics. We then study the effect of decoherence on the\nsingle-photon subtracted squeezed states. We present results for two different\nmodels of decoherence, viz. amplitude decay model and the phase diffusion\nmodel. In each case we give analytical results for the time evolution of the\nstate. We discuss the loss of nonclassicality as a result of decoherence. We\nshow through the study of their phase-space properties how these states decay\nto vacuum due to the decay of photons. We show that phase damping leads to very\nslow decoherence than the photon-number decay.\n"]}
