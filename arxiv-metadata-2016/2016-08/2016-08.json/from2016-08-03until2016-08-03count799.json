We also present the symplectic method we use to explore stability\nof equilibrium states, directly related to the dissipation induced instability\nmechanism well known in theoretical mechanics and plasma physics.\n", "  With evolutionary game theory, mathematicians, physicists and theoretical\nbiologists usually show us beautiful figures of population dynamic patterns.\n2x2 game (matching pennies game) is one of the classical cases. In this letter,\nwe report our finding that, there exists a dynamical pattern, called as social\nspiral, in human subjects 2x2 experiment data. In a flow/velocity vector field\nmethod, we explore the data in the discrete lattices of the macro-level social\nstrategy space in the games, and then above spiral pattern emergent. This\nfinding hints that, there exists a macro-level order beyond the stochastic\nprocess in micro-level. We notice that, the vector pattern provides an\ninteresting way to conceal evolutionary game theory models and experimental\neconomics data. This lattice vector field method provides a novel way for\nmodels evaluating and experiment designing.\n", "  Among its great findings, the IRAS mission showed the existence of an\nunidentified mid-IR feature around 21 um. Since its discovery, this feature has\nbeen detected in all C-rich proto-PNe of intermediate spectral type (A-G) and -\nweakly - in a few PNe and AGB stars, but the nature of its carriers remains\nunknown. In this paper, we show the detection of this feature in the spectra of\nthree new stars transiting from the AGB to the PN stage obtained with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. Following a recent suggestion, we try to model the\nSEDs of our targets with amorphous carbon and FeO, which might be responsible\nfor the unidentified feature. The fit thus obtained is not completely\nsatisfactory, since the shape of the feature is not well matched. In the\nattempt to relate the unidentified feature to other dust features, we retrieved\nmid-IR spectra of all the 21-um sources currently known from ISO and Spitzer\non-line archives and noticed a correlation between the flux emitted in the\n21-um feature and that emitted at 7 and 11 um (PAH bands and HAC broad\nemission). Such a correlation may point to a common nature of the carriers.\n", "  We prove dispersive estimates in R^3 for the Schroedinger evolution generated\nby the Hamiltonian H = -\\Delta+V, under optimal decay conditions on V, in the\npresence of zero energy eigenfunctions and resonances.\n", "  We study the contact resistance and the transfer characteristics of\nback-gated field effect transistors of mono- and bi-layer graphene. We measure\nspecific contact resistivity of ~7kohm*um2 and ~30kohm*um2 for Ni and Ti,\nrespectively. We show that the contact resistance is a significant contributor\nto the total source-to-drain resistance and it is modulated by the back-gate\nvoltage. We measure transfer characteristics showing double dip feature that we\nexplain as the effect of doping due to charge transfer from the contacts\ncausing minimum density of states for graphene under the contacts and in the\nchannel at different gate voltage.\n", "  Properties of the orbitally excited (L=1) $B_s$ states are studied using 1.0\nfb$^{-1}$ of pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =7$ TeV collected with the LHCb\ndetector. The first observation of the $B_{s2}^*(5840)^0$ meson decaying to\n$B^{*+} K^-$ is reported, and the corresponding branching fraction measured\nrelative to the $B^+ K^-$ decay mode. The $B_{s1}(5830)^0 \\to B^{*+} K^-$ decay\nis observed as well. The width of the $B_{s2}^*(5840)^0$ state is measured for\nthe first time and the masses of the two states are determined with the highest\nprecision to date. The observation of the $B_{s2}^*(5840)^0 \\to B^{*+} K^-$\ndecay favours the spin-parity assignment $J^P = 2^+$ for the $B_{s2}^*(5840)^0$\nmeson. In addition, the most precise measurement of the mass difference\n$m(B^{*+})-m(B^+) = 45.01 \\pm 0.30 (stat) \\pm 0.23 (syst)$ MeV/$c^2$ is\nobtained.\n", "  We present a simple model where the effective cosmological constant appears\nfrom chameleon scalar fields. For a Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi\n(KKLT)-inspired form of the potential and a particular chameleon coupling to\nthe local density, patches of approximately constant scalar field potential\ncluster around regions of matter with density above a certain value, generating\nthe effect of a cosmological constant on large scales. This construction\naddresses both the cosmological constant problem (why $\\Lambda$ is so small,\nyet nonzero) and the coincidence problem (why $\\Lambda$ is comparable to the\nmatter density now).\n", "  We study the effects of imperfections on the fidelity of the Toffoli gate\nrecently realized in a circuit~QED setup using quantum control methods. The\nnoise is introduced in the interqubits interactions. The coupling constants are\nno longer fixed; instead, they fluctuate around average values obeying some\ngiven probability density functions characterizing the dynamical-imperfection\ncase. We also consider the static-imperfection case in which the values of the\ncoupling constants are not exactly known. We obtain a more robust gate by\nmodifying the quantum optimization problem using a weighted average of the\nfidelity over an interval of coupling values as the objective functional.\n", "  Transverse magneto-thermoelectric effects are studied in permalloy thin films\ngrown on MgO and GaAs substrates and compared to those grown on suspended SiN\nmembranes. The transverse voltage along platinum strips patterned on top of the\npermalloy films is measured vs. the external magnetic field as a function of\nangle and temperature gradient. After the identification of the contribution of\nthe planar and anomalous Nernst effects, we find an upper limit for the\ntransverse spin Seebeck effect, which is several orders of magnitude smaller\nthan previously reported.\n", "  We fabricated NiFe2O thin films on MgAl2O4 (001) substrates by reactive dc\nmagnetron co-sputtering in a pure oxygen atmosphere at different substrate\ntemperatures. The film properties were investigated by various techniques with\na focus on their structure, surface topography, magnetic characteristics, and\ntransport properties. Structural analysis revealed a good crystallization with\nepitaxial growth and low roughness and a similar quality as in films grown by\npulsed laser deposition. Electrical conductivity measurements showed high room\ntemperature resistivity (12 Ohmm), but low activation energy, indicating an\nextrinsic transport mechanism. A band gap of about 1.55 eV was found by optical\nspectroscopy. Detailed x-ray spectroscopy studies confirmed the samples to be\nferrimagnetic with fully compensated Fe moments. By comparison with multiplet\ncalculations of the spectra we found that the cation valencies are to a large\nextent Ni2+ and Fe3+.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger operator in two dimensions with a periodic\npotential and a strong constant magnetic field perturbed by slowly varying\nnon-periodic scalar and vector potentials, $\\phi(\\epsilon x)$ and $A(\\epsilon\nx)$, for $\\epsilon\\ll 1$. For each isolated family of magnetic Bloch bands we\nderive an effective Hamiltonian that is unitarily equivalent to the restriction\nof the Schr\\\"odinger operator to a corresponding almost invariant subspace. At\nleading order, our effective Hamiltonian can be interpreted as the Peierls\nsubstitution Hamiltonian widely used in physics for non-magnetic Bloch bands.\nHowever, while for non-magnetic Bloch bands the corresponding result is well\nunderstood, for magnetic Bloch bands it is not clear how to even define a\nPeierls substitution Hamiltonian beyond a formal expression. The source of the\ndifficulty is a topological obstruction: magnetic Bloch bundles are generically\nnot trivializable. As a consequence, Peierls substitution Hamiltonians for\nmagnetic Bloch bands turn out to be pseudodifferential operators acting on\nsections of non-trivial vector bundles over a two-torus, the reduced Brillouin\nzone. Part of our contribution is the construction of a suitable Weyl calculus\nfor such pseudos. As an application of our results we construct a new family of\ncanonical one-band Hamiltonians $H^B_{\\theta,q}$ for magnetic Bloch bands with\nChern number $\\theta\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ that generalizes the Hofstadter model\n$H^B_{\\rm Hof} = H^B_{0,1}$ for a single non-magnetic Bloch band. It turns out\nthat $H^B_{\\theta,q}$ is isospectral to $H^{q^2B}_{\\rm Hof}$ for any $\\theta$\nand all spectra agree with the Hofstadter spectrum depicted in his famous black\nand white butterfly. However, the resulting Chern numbers of subbands,\ncorresponding to Hall conductivities, depend on $\\theta$ and $q$, and thus the\nmodels lead to different colored butterflies.\n", "  We investigated the magnetic anisotropy ratio of thin sputtered\npolycrystalline MgB2 films on MgO substrates. Using high magnetic field\nmeasurements, we estimated an anisotropy ratio of 1.35 for T=0 K with an upper\ncritical field of 31.74 T in the parallel case and 23.5 T in the perpendicular\ncase. Direct measurements of a magnetic-field sweep at 4.2 K show a linear\nbehavior, confirmed by a linear fit for magnetic fields perpendicular to the\nfilm plane. Furthermore, we observed a change of up to 12% of the anisotropy\nratio in dependence of the film thickness.\n", "  The observation of propagating magneto-hydrodynamic kink waves in magnetic\nstructures and measurement of their properties (amplitude, phase speed) can be\nused to diagnose the plasma conditions in the neighbourhood of the magnetic\nstructure via magneto-seismology (MS). We aim to reveal properties of the\nchromosphere/Transition Region above the sunspot penumbra using this technique.\nHinode observed a sunspot as it was crossing the limb, providing a unique side\non view of the sunspot atmosphere. The presence of large spicule-like jets is\nevident in \\ion{Ca}{II} H images. The jets are found to support transverse wave\nmotions that displace the central axis, which can be interpreted as a kink\nwave. The properties of a wave event are measured and used to determine the\nmagnetic and density stratification along the structure. We also measure the\nwidth of the spicule and the intensity profile along the structure. The\nmeasured wave properties reveal an initial rapid increase in amplitude with\nheight above the solar surface, followed by a decrease in amplitude. The MS\ninversion suggests this initial increase corresponds to large changes in\ndensity and magnetic field strength. In addition, we provide the first\nmeasurements of spicule width with height, which confirm that the spicule under\ngoes rapid expansion. The measured expansion shows good agreement with the\nresults from the MS. The observed variations in plasma parameters are suggested\nto be partly due to the presence of a gravitational stratified, ambient\natmosphere. Combining width measurements with phase speed measurements implies\nthe observed decrease in wave amplitude at greater heights can be explained by\nwave damping. Hence, we provide the first direct evidence of wave damping in\nchromospheric spicules and the quality factor of the damping is found to be\nsignificantly smaller than estimated coronal values.\n", "  The Slope Conjecture relates a quantum knot invariant, (the degree of the\ncolored Jones polynomial of a knot) with a classical one (boundary slopes of\nincompressible surfaces in the knot complement). The degree of the colored\nJones polynomial can be computed by a suitable (almost tight) state sum and the\nsolution of a corresponding quadratic integer programming problem. We\nillustrate this principle for a 2-parameter family of 2-fusion knots. Combined\nwith the results of Dunfield and the first author, this confirms the Slope\nConjecture for the 2-fusion knots.\n", "  Hundreds of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies encircle the Milky Way. Many\nof these systems have undergone partial disruption due to tidal forces,\nlittering the halo with stellar streams. These tidal tails are sensitive to the\nGalactic potential, facilitating an excellent laboratory to investigate Galaxy\nformation and evolution, as well as local chemical signatures of differing star\nformation environments. To better understand the emergence of the Milky Way,\nthis thesis examines the dynamics and chemistry of a number of known stellar\nstreams.\n", "  In this paper, the multi-type branching process is applied to describe the\nstatistics and interdependencies of line outages, the load shed, and isolated\nbuses. The offspring mean matrix of the multi-type branching process is\nestimated by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and can quantify the\nextent of outage propagation. The joint distribution of two types of outages is\nestimated by the multi-type branching process via the Lagrange-Good inversion.\nThe proposed model is tested with data generated by the AC OPA cascading\nsimulations on the IEEE 118-bus system. The largest eigenvalues of the\noffspring mean matrix indicate that the system is closer to criticality when\nconsidering the interdependence of different types of outages. Compared with\nempirically estimating the joint distribution of the total outages, good\nestimate is obtained by using the multitype branching process with a much\nsmaller number of cascades, thus greatly improving the efficiency. It is shown\nthat the multitype branching process can effectively predict the distribution\nof the load shed and isolated buses and their conditional largest possible\ntotal outages even when there are no data of them.\n", "  The 62Sm, 64Gd, 64Dy, 70Y b, 72Hf and 74W nuclei are classified as deformed\nnuclei. Low-lying bands are one of the most fundamental excitation modes in the\nenergy spectra of deformed nuclei. In this paper a theoretical analysis of the\nexperimental data within the phenomenological model is presented. The energy\nspectra of ground states are calculated. It is found the low-lying spectra of\nground band states are in good agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  The 16O(e,e'p) reaction in the quasi-elastic region has been studied in\nseveral experiments to determine spectroscopic factors, hence, the degree to\nwhich $^{16}$O looks like a closed shell. By varying the kinematics,\nexperimentalists are able to extract response functions which comprise the\ncross section. However, analysis of the response functions separately produces\nvery different spectroscopic factors. Two calculations led to different\nconclusions as to whether exchange currents can eliminate the discrepancies.\nNeither calculation considered relativistic corrections.\n  The purpose of the article is to investigate the disagreement as to whether\nexchange currents are the solution to obtaining consistent spectroscopic\nfactors, and to show that relativistic corrections have a much greater\ninfluence on providing this consistency.\n  This calculation employs the recoil corrected continuum shell model, a model\nthat uses a realistic interaction, and produces non-spurious scatterings states\nthat are solutions to the coupled channels problems. Pionic and pair\ncontributions to the exchange currents were calculated as developed by Dubach,\nKoch, and Donnelly. Relativistic effects are included by use of the direct\nPauli reduction.\n  Contributions of the exchange currents are shown to be insufficient to\nprovide consistent spectroscopic factors. However, the inclusion of\nrelativistic corrections, that can be large, lead to more consistent\nspectroscopic factors and cross sections. The influence of channel coupling is\nalso shown to be significant. Tests of current conservation show that inclusion\nof the direct Pauli reduction produces small increases in its violation.\nResponse functions which depend on the transverse current are sensitive to the\nlower component of relativistic wave functions, and hence, would provide a\nmeasure of the appropriateness of any relativistic model.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of mixed-species ion crystals during transport\nbetween spatially distinct locations in a linear Paul trap in the diabatic\nregime. In a general mixed-species crystal, all degrees of freedom along the\ndirection of transport are excited by an accelerating well, so unlike the case\nof same-species ions, where only the center-of-mass-mode is excited, several\ndegrees of freedom have to be simultaneously controlled by the transport\nprotocol. We design protocols that lead to low final excitations in the\ndiabatic regime using invariant-based inverse-engineering for two\ndifferent-species ions and also show how to extend this approach to longer\nmixed-species ion strings. Fast transport of mixed-species ion strings can\nsignificantly reduce the time overhead in certain architectures for scalable\nquantum information processing with trapped ions.\n", "  We derive a general expression that quantifies the total entanglement\nproduction rate in continuous variable systems, where a source emits two\nentangled Gaussian beams with arbitrary correlators.This expression is\nespecially useful for situations where the source emits an arbitrary frequency\nspectrum,e.g. when cavities are involved. To exemplify its meaning and\npotential, we apply it to a four-mode optomechanical setup that enables the\nsimultaneous up- and down-conversion of photons from a drive laser into\nentangled photon pairs. This setup is efficient in that both the drive and the\noptomechanical up- and down-conversion can be fully resonant.\n", "  We compare experiments and direct numerical simulations to evaluate the\naccuracy of the Stokes-drag model, which is used widely in studies of inertial\nparticles in turbulence. We focus on statistics at the dissipation scale and on\nextreme values of relative particle velocities for moderately inertial\nparticles (St < 1). The probability distributions of relative velocities in the\nsimulations were qualitatively similar to those in the experiments. The\nagreement improved with increasing Stokes number and decreasing relative\nvelocity. Simulations underestimated the probability of extreme events, which\nsuggests that the Stokes drag model misses important dynamics. Nevertheless,\nthe scaling behavior of the extreme events in both the experiments and the\nsimulations can be captured by the same multi-fractal model.\n", "  We realized point contact spectroscopy experiment on\nferromagnet/superconductor bilayers. Differential conductance curves show\nseveral features that we explained within Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism\nconsidering the presence of two interfaces in the\nnormal-metal-tip/ferromagnet/superconductor device. We demonstrate that such\nconfiguration is suitable as local probe of the spin polarization and thickness\nof ferromagnetic layer, directly on bilayer areas. This is due to the high\nsensitivity of the Andreev surface states to the physical properties of the\nferromagnetic interlayer.\n", "  Inelastic light scattering studies on single crystals of\n(Na$_{1-x}$Li$_x$)$_2$IrO$_3$ ($x = 0, 0.05$ and $0.15$) show a polarization\nindependent broad band at $\\sim $~2750 cm$^{-1}$ with a large band-width $\\sim\n1800$~cm$^{-1}$. For Na$_2$IrO$_3$ the broad band is seen for temperatures $\n\\leq 200$~K and persists inside the magnetically ordered state. For Li doped\nsamples, the intensity of this mode increases, shifts to lower wave-numbers and\npersists to higher temperatures. Such a mode has recently been predicted\n(Knolle et.al.) as a signature of the Kitaev spin liquid. We assign the\nobservation of the broad band to be a signature of strong Kitaev-exchange\ncorrelations. The fact that the broad band persists even inside the\nmagnetically ordered state suggests that dynamically fluctuating moments\nsurvive even below $T_{N}$. This is further supported by our mean field\ncalculations. The Raman response calculated in mean field theory shows that the\nbroad band predicted for the spin liquid state survives in the magnetically\nordered state near the zigzag-spin liquid phase boundary. A comparison with the\ntheoretical model gives an estimate of the Kitaev exchange interaction\nparameter to be $J_K\\approx 57$~meV.\n", "  We have been developing monolithic active pixel sensors, known as Kyoto's\nX-ray SOIPIXs, based on the CMOS SOI (silicon-on-insulator) technology for\nnext-generation X-ray astronomy satellites. The event trigger output function\nimplemented in each pixel offers microsecond time resolution and enables\nreduction of the non-X-ray background that dominates the high X-ray energy band\nabove 5--10 keV. A fully depleted SOI with a thick depletion layer and back\nillumination offers wide band coverage of 0.3--40 keV. Here, we report recent\nprogress in the X-ray SOIPIX development. In this study, we achieved an energy\nresolution of 300~eV (FWHM) at 6~keV and a read-out noise of 33~e- (rms) in the\nframe readout mode, which allows us to clearly resolve Mn-K$\\alpha$ and\nK$\\beta$. Moreover, we produced a fully depleted layer with a thickness of\n$500~{\\rm \\mu m}$. The event-driven readout mode has already been successfully\ndemonstrated.\n", "  The exactly solvable model of quasi-conical quantum dot, having a form of\nspherical sector is proposed. Due to the specific symmetry of the problem the\nseparation of variables in spherical coordinates is possible in the\none-electron Schrodinger equation. Analytical expressions for wave function and\nenergy spectrum are obtained. It is shown that at small values of the stretch\nangle of spherical sector the problem reduced to the conical QD problem. The\ncomparison with previously performed works showed good agreement of results. As\nan application of the obtained results, the quantum transitions in the system\nare considered.\n", "  We analyze the multifractality of the fidelity in an engineered Toffoli gate.\nUsing quantum control methods, we define several optimization problems whose\nglobal solutions realize the gate in a chain of three qubits with XY Heisenberg\ninteraction. We perturb the system by introducing imperfections in the form of\n$1/f$ noise to the interqubit couplings. Multifractal analysis shows that the\ndegree of multifractality in the gate fidelity increases when optimized control\npulses used to render the fidelity are less sensitive to variations in the\ninterqubits coupling strengths.\n", "  Low-dimensional electron systems, as realized naturally in graphene or\ncreated artificially at the interfaces of heterostructures, exhibit a variety\nof fascinating quantum phenomena with great prospects for future applications.\nOnce electrons are confined to low dimensions, they also tend to spontaneously\nbreak the symmetry of the underlying nuclear lattice by forming so-called\ndensity waves; a state of matter that currently attracts enormous attention\nbecause of its relation to various unconventional electronic properties. In\nthis study we reveal a remarkable and surprising feature of charge density\nwaves (CDWs), namely their intimate relation to orbital order. For the\nprototypical material 1T-TaS2 we not only show that the CDW within the\ntwo-dimensional TaS2-layers involves previously unidentified orbital textures\nof great complexity. We also demonstrate that two metastable stackings of the\norbitally ordered layers allow to manipulate salient features of the electronic\nstructure. Indeed, these orbital effects enable to switch the properties of\n1T-TaS2 nanostructures from metallic to semiconducting with technologically\npertinent gaps of the order of 200 meV. This new type of orbitronics is\nespecially relevant for the ongoing development of novel, miniaturized and\nultra-fast devices based on layered transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  Pure states are very important in any theory since they represent states of\nmaximal information about the system within the theory. Here, we show that no\nnon-trivial (not local realistic) extremal states (boxes) of general\nno-signaling theories can be realized within quantum theory. We then explore\nthree interesting consequences of this fact. Firstly, since the pure states are\nuncorrelated from the environment, the statement forms a no-go result against\nthe most straightforward device-independent protocol for randomness or secure\nkey generation against general no-signaling adversaries. It also leads to the\ninteresting question whether all non-extremal boxes allow for non-local\ncorrelations with the adversary. Secondly, in addition to the fact that new\ninformation-theoretic principles (designed to pick out the set of quantum\ncorrelations from among all non signaling ones) can in consequence be tested on\narbitrary non-local vertices to check their validity, it also allows the\npossibility of excluding from the quantum set any box of no-signaling\ncorrelations that can be distilled to a non-local vertex. Finally, it also\nforms a sufficient condition to identify non-local games with no quantum\nwinning strategy, when one can show that the game has a single unique\nnon-signaling winning strategy. We illustrate each of these consequences with\nthe example of generalized Popescu-Rohrlich boxes.\n", "  We investigate the inverse spin Hall voltage of a 10nm thin Pt strip\ndeposited on the magnetic insulators Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) and NiFe2O4 (NFO) with a\ntemperature gradient in the film plane. We observe characteristics typical of\nthe spin Seebeck effect, although we do not observe a change of sign of the\nvoltage at the Pt strip when it is moved from hot to cold side, which is\nbelieved to be the most striking feature of the transverse spin Seebeck effect.\nTherefore, we relate the observed voltages to the longitudinal spin Seebeck\neffect generated by a parasitic out-of-plane temperature gradient, which can be\nsimulated by contact tips of different material and heat conductivities and by\ntip heating. This work gives new insights into the interpretation of transverse\nspin Seebeck effect experiments, which are still under discussion.\n", "  Perovskite SrIrO3 has long been proposed as an exotic semimetal induced by\nthe interplay between the spin-orbit coupling and electron correlations.\nHowever, its low-lying electronic structure is still lacking. We synthesize\nhigh-quality perovskite SrIrO3 (100) films by means of oxide molecular beam\nepitaxy, and then systemically investigate their low energy electronic\nstructure using in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that\nthe hole-like bands around R and the electron-like bands around U(T) intersect\nthe Fermi level simultaneously, providing the direct evidence of the\nsemimetallic ground state in this compound. Comparing with the density\nfunctional theory, we discover that the bandwidth of states near Fermi level is\nextremely small, and there exists a pronounced mixing between the Jeff = 1/2\nand Jeff = 3/2 states. Moreover, our data reveal that the predicted Dirac\ndegeneracy protected by the mirror-symmetry, which was theoretically suggested\nto be the key to realize the non-trivial topological properties, is actually\nlifted in perovskite SrIrO3 thin films. Our findings pose strong constraints on\nthe current theoretical models for the 5d iridates.\n", "  We employ the recently developed multi-time scale averaging method to study\nthe large time behavior of slowly changing (in time) Hamiltonians. We treat\nsome known cases in a new way, such as the Zener problem, and we give another\nproof of the Adiabatic Theorem in the gapless case. We prove a new Uniform\nErgodic Theorem for slowly changing unitary operators. This theorem is then\nused to derive the adiabatic theorem, do the scattering theory for such\nHamiltonians, and prove some classical propagation estimates and Asymptotic\nCompleteness.\n", "  The transformation stretch tensor plays an essential role in the evaluation\nof conditions of compatibility between phases and the use of the Cauchy-Born\nrule. This tensor is difficult to measure directly from experiment. We give an\nalgorithm for the determination of the transformation stretch tensor from x-ray\nmeasurements of structure and lattice parameters. When evaluated on some\ntraditional and emerging phase transformations the algorithm gives unexpected\nresults.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics under diabatic expansions/compressions of linear\nion chains.Combining a dynamical normal-mode harmonic approximation with the\ninvariant-based inverse-engineering technique, we design protocols that\nminimize the final motional excitation of the ions. This can substantially\nreduce the transition time between high and low trap-frequency operations,\npotentially contributing to the development of scalable quantum information\nprocessing.\n", "  We explore physics of unstable particles when mother particle mass is around\nthe sum of its daughter particle masses. In this case, the conventional wave\nfunction renormalization factor is ill-defined. We propose a simple resolution\nof the threshold singularity problem which still allows the use of narrow width\napproximation by defining branching ratio in terms of spectral density. The\nresonance peak and shape is different for different decay channels and no\nsingle decay width can be assigned to the unstable particles. Non-exponential\ndecay happens in all time scales.\n", "  Photoinjectors are widely used for linear accelerators as electron sources to\ngenerate high-brightness electron beam. Drive laser, which determines the\ntiming structure and quality of the electron beam, is a crucial device of\nphotoinjector. A new drive laser system has been designed and constructed for\nthe upgraded 3.5-cell DC-SRF photoinjector at Peking University. The drive\nlaser system consists of a 1064 nm laser oscillator, a four- stage amplifier,\nthe second and fourth harmonic generators, the optical system to transfer the\nUV pulses to the photocathode, and the synchronization system. The drive laser\nsystem has been successfully applied in the stable operation of DC-SRF\nphotoinjector and its performance meets the requirements. 266 nm laser with an\naverage power close to 1W can be delivered to illuminate the Cs2Te photocathode\nand the instability is less than 5% for long time operation. The design\nconsideration for improving the UV laser quality, a detailed description of\nlaser system, and its performance are presented in this paper.\n", "  A silicon pixel detector with fine pitch size of 19x19 um, developed base on\nSOI (silicon on insulator) technology, was tested under the illumination of\ninfrared laser pulses. As an alternative way to particle beam tests, the laser\npulses were tuned to very short duration and small transverse profile to\nsimulate the tracks of MIPs (minimum ionization particles) in silicon. Hit\ncluster sizes were measured with focused laser pulses propagating through the\nSOI detector perpendicular to its surface and most of the induced charge was\nfound to be collected inside the seed pixel. For the first time, the signal\namplitude as a function of the applied bias voltage was measured for this SOI\ndetector, deepening understanding of its depletion characteristics.\n", "  In this article we use all-atom simulations to elucidate the mechanisms\nunderlying conformational switching and allostery within the coat protein of\nthe bacteriophage MS2. Assembly of most icosahedral virus capsids requires that\nthe capsid protein adopt different conformations at precise locations within\nthe capsid. It has been shown that a 19 nucleotide stem loop (TR) from the MS2\ngenome acts as an allosteric effector, guiding conformational switching of the\ncoat protein during capsid assembly. Since the principal conformational changes\noccur far from the TR binding site, it is important to understand the molecular\nmechanism underlying this allosteric communication. To this end, we use\nall-atom simulations with explicit water combined with a path sampling\ntechnique to sample the MS2 coat protein conformational transition, in the\npresence and absence of TR-binding. The calculations find that TR binding\nstrongly alters the transition free energy profile, leading to a switch in the\nfavored conformation. We discuss changes in molecular interactions responsible\nfor this shift. We then identify networks of amino acids with correlated\nmotions to reveal the mechanism by which effects of TR binding span the\nprotein. The analysis predicts amino acids whose substitution by mutagenesis\ncould alter populations of the conformational substates or their transition\nrates.\n", "  In this paper we showed a systematic method of appropriate parameter choice\nfor a circular pp collider by using analytical expression of beam-beam tune\nshift limit started from given design goal and technical limitations. A\nparameter space has been explored. Based on parameters scan and considerations\nfrom RF systems, a set of appropriate parameter designed for a 50Km and a 100Km\ncircular proton-proton collider was proposed.\n", "  We studied the Co valences and spin states in electron-doped\nLaCo$_{1-y}$Te$_{y}$O$_3$ by measuring x-ray absorption spectra and electron\nspin resonance. The low-temperature insulating state involves the low-spin\nCo$^{3+}$ ($S=0$) and the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ state, which is described by\n$g=3.8$ and $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$. The results, in concurrence with the\nelectron-hole asymmetry confirmed in electrical resistivity, coincide with a\nspin-blockade phenomenon in this system. Further, we discuss the $g$ factor in\nterms of the strong covalent-bonding nature and consider multiple origins of\nthis phenomenon.\n", "  Modeling approaches of suspended, rod-like particles and recent experimental\ndata have shown that depletion forces display different signatures depending on\nthe orientation of these particles. It has been shown that axial attraction of\ntwo rods yields contractile forces of 0.1pN that are independent of the\nrelative axial shift of the two rods. Here, we measured depletion-caused\ninteractions of actin bundles extending the phase space of single pairs of rods\nto a multi-particle system. In contrast to a filament pair, we found forces up\nto 3pN . Upon bundle relaxation forces decayed exponentially with a mean decay\ntime of 3.4s . These different dynamics are explained within the frame of a\nmathematical model by taking pairwise interactions to a multi-filament scale.\nThe macromolecular content employed for our experiments is well below the\ncrowding of cells. Thus, we propose that arising forces can contribute to\nbiological force generation without the need to convert chemical energy into\nmechanical work.\n", "  A new method for analyzing collimation angle of neutron Soller collimator is\ndescribed. Gaussian distribution formula is used to define the angle\ndistribution function of neutron source and neutron transmission function of\nSoller collimator. A relationship between FWHM of collimator rocking curve and\ncollimation angle is derived.\n", "  Carbon ions offer significant advantages for deep-seated local tumors therapy\ndue to their physical and biological properties. Secondary particles,\nespecially neutrons caused by heavy ion reactions should be carefully\nconsidered in treatment process and radiation protection. For radiation\nprotection purposes, the FLUKA Code was used in order to evaluate the radiation\nfield at deep tumor therapy room of HIRFL in this paper. The neutron energy\nspectra, neutron dose and energy deposition of carbon ion and neutron in\ntissue-like media was studied for bombardment of solid water target by 430MeV/u\nC ions. It is found that the calculated neutron dose have a good agreement with\nthe experimental date, and the secondary neutron dose may not exceed one in a\nthousand of the carbon ions dose at Bragg peak area in tissue-like media.\n", "  The Coulomb effects hypothesis is used to interpret even-odd effects of\nmaximum total kinetic energy as a function of mass and charge of fragments from\nthermal neutron induced fission of 235U. Assuming spherical fragments at\nscission, the Coulomb interaction energy between fragments (C_sph) is higher\nthan the Q-value, the available energy. Therefore at scission the fragments\nmust be deformed, so that the Coulomb interaction energy does not exceed the\nQ-value. The fact that the even-odd effects in the maximum total kinetic energy\nas a function of the charge and mass, respectively, are lower than the even-odd\neffects of Q is consistent with the assumption that odd mass fragments are\nsofter than the even-even fragments. Even-odd effects of charge distribution in\nsuper asymmetric fragmentation also are interpreted with the Coulomb effect\nhypothesis. Because the difference between C_sph and Q increases with\nasymmetry, fragmentations require higher total deformation energy to occur.\nHigher deformation energy of the fragments implies lower free energy to break\npairs of nucleons. This explains why in the asymmetric fragmentation region,\nthe even-odd effects of the distribution of proton number and neutron number\nincreases with asymmetry. Based on a similar reasoning, a prediction of a\nrelatively high even-odd effect in symmetric fragmentations is proposed.\n", "  The ARGO-YBJ experiment is a full-coverage air shower detector located at the\nYangbajing Cosmic Ray Observatory (Tibet, People's Republic of China, 4300 m\na.s.l.). The high altitude, combined with the full-coverage technique, allows\nthe detection of extensive air showers in a wide energy range and offer the\npossibility of measuring the cosmic ray proton plus helium spectrum down to the\nTeV region, where direct balloon/space-borne measurements are available. The\ndetector has been in stable data taking in its full configuration from November\n2007 to February 2013. In this paper the measurement of the cosmic ray proton\nplus helium energy spectrum is presented in the region 3-300 TeV by analyzing\nthe full collected data sample. The resulting spectral index is $\\gamma = -2.64\n\\pm 0.01$. These results demonstrate the possibility of performing an accurate\nmeasurement of the spectrum of light elements with a ground based air shower\ndetector.\n", "  A Hybrid single cavity (HSC) linac, which is formed by combining a radio\nfrequency quadrupole (RFQ) structure and a drift tube (DT) structure into one\ninterdigital-H (IH) cavity, is fabricated and assembled as a proof of principle\n(PoP) type injector for cancer therapy synchrotron according to the series\nresearches. The injection method of the HSC linac adopt a direct plasma\ninjection scheme (DPIS), which is considered to be the only method for\naccelerating an intense current heavy ion beam produced by a laser ion source\n(LIS). The input beam current of the HSC was designed to be 20 milliampere (mA)\nC6+ ions. According to numerical simulations, the HSC linac could accelerate a\n6-mA C6+ beam which meets requirement of the needed particle number for cancer\ntherapy use (108~9 ions per pulse). The injection system adopted HSC injector\nwith the method of DPIS can make the existing multi-turn injection system and\nthe stripping system unnecessary, and also can make the beam pipe of the\nexisting synchrotron magnets downsize which could reduce the whole cost of\nsynchrotron (estimated millions dollars). Details of the measurements and\nevaluations of the assembled HSC linac, and the results of the high power test\nusing a LIS with DPIS are reported in this paper.\n", "  We present the discovery of a relationship between the maximum ratio of the\nflare flux (namely, 0.5-4 Ang to the 1-8 Ang flux) and non-flare background\n(namely, the 1-8 Ang background flux), which clearly separates flares into\nclasses by peak flux level. We established this relationship based on an\nanalysis of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) X-ray\nobservations of ~ 50,000 X, M, C, and B flares derived from the NOAA/SWPC\nflares catalog. Employing a combination of machine learning techniques\n(K-nearest neighbors and nearest-centroid algorithms) we show a separation of\nthe observed parameters for the different peak flaring energies. This analysis\nis validated by successfully predicting the flare classes for 100% of the\nX-class flares, 76% of the M-class flares, 80% of the C-class flares and 81% of\nthe B-class flares for solar cycle 24, based on the training of the parametric\nextracts for solar flares in cycles 22-23.\n", "  The use of the minus identity lenses with the angle-cut collimator can\nachieve high contrast image in high-energy proton radiography. This article\npresents the principle of choosing the angle-cut aperture of the collimator for\nthe different energies and objects. The numerical simulation using the Monte\nCarlo code Geant4 has been implemented to investigate the entire radiography\nfor the French test object. The optimum angle-cut apertures of the collimators\nare also obtained for different energies.\n", "  The fast extraction kicker system is one of the most important accelerator\ncomponents, whose inner structure will be the main source of the impedance in\nthe RCS. It is necessary to understand the kicker impedance before its\ninstallation into the tunnel. The conventional and improved wire methods are\nemployed for the benchmarking impedance measurement results. The simulation and\nmeasurements confirm that the window-frame ferrite geometry and the end plate\nare the important structures causing the coupling impedance. The total\nimpedance of the eight modules systems is determined by the scaling law from\nthe measurement and the impedance measurement of the kicker system is\nsummarized.\n", "  Non-equilibrium fluctuations of various stochastic variables, such as work\nand entropy production, have been widely discussed recently in the context of\nlarge deviations, cumulants and fluctuation relations. Typically, one looks at\nthe distribution of these observables, at large fixed time. To characterize the\nprecise stochastic nature of the process, we here address the distribution in\nthe time domain. In particular, we focus on the first passage time distribution\n(FPTD) of entropy production, in several realistic models. We find that the\nfluctuation relation symmetry plays a crucial role in getting the typical\nasymptotic behavior. Similarities and differences to the simple random walk\npicture are discussed. For a driven particle in the ring geometry, the mean\nresidence time is connected to the particle current and the steady state\ndistribution, and it leads to a fluctuation relation-like symmetry in terms of\nthe FPTD.\n", "  Considering the aging effects of existing Inner Drift Chamber (IDC) of\nBES\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral3}, a GEM based inner tracker is\nproposed to be designed and constructed as an upgrade candidate for IDC. This\npaper introduces a full simulation package of CGEM-IT with a simplified\ndigitization model, describes the development of the softwares for cluster\nreconstruction and track fitting algorithm based on Kalman filter method for\nCGEM-IT. Preliminary results from the reconstruction algorithms are obtained\nusing a Monte Carlo sample of single muon events in CGEM-IT.\n", "  Hybrid pixel single-photon-counting detectors have been successfully employed\nand widely used in Synchrotron radiation X-ray detection. In this paper, the\nsilicon pixel sensors for single X-ray photon detection, which operate in\nfull-depletion mode have been studied. The pixel sensors were fabricated on\n4-inch, N type, 320{\\mu}m thick, high-resistivity silicon wafers. The pixel\nsensors has a p+-in-n structure with varies of pixel size and gap size\nincluding guard-ring structures. Later, the pixel sensor was wire bonded to the\nASIC circuits and tested for the performance of X-ray response in the\nsynchrotron beam line (BSRF, 1W2B). From the S-curve scan, we could get the\nenergy resolution and the linear properties between input energy and the\nequivalent generator amplitude. The pixel sensors we fabricated have a good\nenergy linear and high count rate depending on the ASIC readout circuit. We get\nthe 20% energy resolution above 10 keV photon energy via wire bonding. The\nenergy resolution would get better if we bond the sensor via indium ball for\nthe smaller stray capacitance.\n", "  As the main tracking detector of BESIII, the drift chamber works for accurate\nmeasurements of the tracking and the momentum of the charged particles decayed\nfrom the reaction of BEPCII e+ and e-. After operation six years, the drift\nchamber is suffering from aging problems due to huge beam related background.\nThe gains of the cells in the first ten layers experience an obvious decrease,\nreaching a maximum of about 29% for the first layer cells. Two calculation\nmethods for the gains change (Bhabha events and accumulated charges with 0.3%\naging ratio for inner chamber cells) get almost the same results. For the\nMalter effect encountered by the inner drift chamber in Jan., 2012, about 0.2%\nwater vapor was added to MDC gas mixture to solve this cathode aging problem.\nThese results provide an important reference for MDC operation high voltage\nsetting and the upgrade of the inner drift chamber.\n", "  The triaxial dynamics of the quadrupole-deformed rotor model of both the\nrigid and the irrotational type have been investigated in detail. The results\nindicate that level patterns and E2 transitional characters of the two types of\nthe model can be matched with each other to the leading order of the\ndeformation parameter $\\beta$. Especially, it is found that the dynamical\nstructure of the irrotational type with most triaxial deformation\n($\\gamma=30^\\circ$) is equivalent to that of the rigid type with oblate\ndeformation ($\\gamma=60^\\circ$), and the associated spectrum can be classified\ninto the standard rotational bands obeying the rotational $L(L+1)$-law or\nregrouped into a new ground- and $\\gamma$-band with odd-even staggering in the\nnew $\\gamma$-band commonly recognized as a signature of the triaxiality. The\ndifferences between the two types of the model in this case are emphasized\nespecially on the E2 transitional characters.\n", "  Linear alkyl benzene (LAB) will be used as the solvent of a liquid\nscintillator mixture for the JUNO antineutrino experiment in the near future.\nIts light absorption property should therefore be understood prior to its\neffective use in the experiment. Attenuation length measurements at a light\nwavelength of 430 nm have been performed on samples of LAB prepared for the\npurpose of the JUNO experiment. Inorganic impurities in LAB have also been\nstudied for their possibilities of light absorption in our wavelength of\ninterest. In view of a tentative plan by the JUNO collaboration to utilize\nneutron capture with hydrogen in the detector, we have also presented in this\nwork, a study on the carbon-hydrogen ratio and the relationship thereof with\nthe attenuation length of the samples.\n", "  In the readout electronics of the Water Cerenkov Detector Array (WCDA) in the\nLarge High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) experiment, both\nhigh-resolution charge and time measurement are required over a dynamic range\nfrom 1 photoelectron (P.E.) to 4000 P.E. The Analog Front-end (AFE) circuit is\none of the crucial parts in the whole readout electronics. We designed and\noptimized a prototype of the AFE through parameter calculation and circuit\nsimulation, and conducted initial electronics tests on this prototype to\nevaluate its performance. Test results indicate that the charge resolution is\nbetter than 1% @ 4000 P.E. and remains better than 10% @ 1 P.E., and the time\nresolution is better than 0.5 ns RMS, which is better than application\nrequirement.\n", "  In this paper we propose a mechanism of natural preheating of our universe by\nintroducing an inflaton field dependent mass term for the gravitational wave\nfor a specific class of massive gravity theory. For any single field\ninflationary model, the inflaton must go through the oscillatory phase after\nthe end of inflation. As has recently been pointed out, if the gravitational\nfluctuation has inflaton dependent mass term, there will be a resonant\namplification of the amplitude of the gravitational wave during the oscillatory\nphase of inflaton. Because of this large enhancement of the amplitude of the\ngravitational wave due to parametric resonance, we show that universe can\nnaturally go through the pre-reheated phase with minimally coupled matter\nfield. Therefore, during the reheating phase, there is no need to introduce any\narbitrary coupling between the matter field and the inflaton .\n", "  Development of new, high quality functional materials has been at the\nforefront of condensed matter research. The recent advent of two-dimensional\nblack phosphorus has greatly enriched the material base of two-dimensional\nelectron systems. Significant progress has been made to achieve high mobility\nblack phosphorus two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) since the development of\nthe first black phosphorus field-effect transistors (FETs)$^{1-4}$. Here, we\nreach a milestone in developing high quality black phosphorus 2DEG - the\nobservation of integer quantum Hall (QH) effect. We achieve high quality by\nembedding the black phosphorus 2DEG in a van der Waals heterostructure close to\na graphite back gate; the graphite gate screens the impurity potential in the\n2DEG, and brings the carrier Hall mobility up to 6000 $cm^{2}V^{-1}s^{-1}$. The\nexceptional mobility enabled us, for the first time, to observe QH effect, and\nto gain important information on the energetics of the spin-split Landau levels\nin black phosphorus. Our results set the stage for further study on quantum\ntransport and device application in the ultrahigh mobility regime.\n", "  In this paper we solve two equivalent time optimal control problems. On one\nhand, we design the control field to implement in minimum time the SWAP (or\nequivalent) operator on a two-level system, assuming that it interacts with an\nadditional, uncontrollable, two-level system. On the other hand, we synthesize\nthe SWAP operator simultaneously, in minimum time, on a pair of two-level\nsystems subject to opposite drifts. We assume that it is possible to perform\nthree independent control actions, and that the total control strength is\nbounded. These controls either affect the dynamics of the target system, under\nthe first perspective, or, simultaneously, the dynamics of both systems, in the\nsecond view. We obtain our results by using techniques of geometric control\ntheory on Lie groups. In particular, we apply the Pontryagin Maximum Principle,\nand provide a complete characterization of singular and non-singular extremals.\nOur analysis shows that the problem can be formulated as the motion of a\nmaterial point in a central force, a well known system in classical mechanics.\nAlthough we focus on obtaining the SWAP operator, many of the ideas and\ntechniques developed in this work apply to the time optimal implementation of\nan arbitrary unitary operator.\n", "  The paper describes the observations and first results of studying the\nmesosphere temperature and dust based on twilight wide-field polarization\nanalysis using original all-sky camera started in 2015 in Apatity, northern\nRussia (67.6 deg N, 33.4 deg E). It is the first twilight polarization\nmeasurements session conducted in the polar region and the first measurements\nduring the winter and early spring season. The general polarization properties\nof twilight sky and the separation procedure of single scattering are\ndescribed. The Boltzmann temperature decrease above 70 km and lack of\nmesosphere dust that is typical for this season are the key results of the\nstudy.\n", "  The electronic structure including energy bands, band weights, and local\ndensity of states (LDOS) of interfaces between hexagonal (AB) and rhombohedral\n(ABC) graphite has been has been calculated. The full-potential local-orbital\ncode (FPLO) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the density\nfunctional theory has been used. Both of the two existing interface structures\nhost (localized) interface bands, which are located around the K-point in the\nBrillouin zone, and which give rise to strong peaks in the LDOS at the Fermi\nenergy. All interface bands near the Fermi energy are localized at monomers\n(single atoms with dangling $p_z$ bonds), whereas those around 0.5 eV belong to\n$p_z$-bonded trimers, which are created by the the interface and which are not\nfound in the two adjacent bulk substances. There is also an interface band at\nthe (AB) side of the interface which resembles one of the interface states near\na stacking fault in (AB) graphite.\n", "  We provide a geometric characterisation of binary sextics with vanishing\nquadratic invariant.\n", "  The discovery of a 125 GeV Higgs boson at the LHC marked a breakthrough in\nparticle physics. The relative lightness of the new particle inspires the\nconsideration of a high luminosity Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC)\nas a Higgs Factory to study the Higgs boson in a clean environment. At the\nCEPC, the beamstrahlung might represent one of the most important sources of\nbeam-induced backgrounds that will impact the detector. It will introduce\nadditional backgrounds to the CEPC detector through the subsequent\nelectron-positron pair production and the hadronic process. Therefore its\nimpacts should be carefully evaluated. In this paper, the beamstrahlung-induced\nbackgrounds are first estimated with analytical methods and are further\nevaluated in detail with Monte Carlo simulation. The detector occupancy due to\nthe beamstrahlung at the location where the first vertex detector layer may be\nplaced is found to be well below 0.5%. Radiation levels characterised as\nnon-ionising energy loss (NIEL) and total ionising dose (TID) are estimated to\nbe ~ $10^{11} 1 $ MeV $ n_{eq}/cm^2/$yr and ~ 300 kRad/yr, respectively.\n", "  There is a key research issue to accurately select out neutron signals and\ndiscriminate gamma signals from a mixed radiation field in the neutron\ndetection. This paper proposes a fractal spectrum discrimination approach by\nmeans of different spectrum characteristics of neutron and gamma. Figure of\nmerit and average discriminant error ratio are adopted together to evaluate the\ndiscriminant effects. Different neutron and gamma signals with various noises\nand pulse pile-ups are simulated according to real data in the literature. The\nproposed approach is compared with the digital charge integration and pulse\ngradient methods. It is found that the fractal approach exhibits the best\ndiscriminant performance among three methods. The fractal spectrum approach is\nnot sensitive to the high frequency noises and pulse pile-ups. It means that\nthe proposed approach takes the advantages of anti-noises and high discriminant\nability, and can be used to better discriminate neutron and gamma in neutron\ndetection.\n", "  The first neutron texture diffractometer in China has been built at China\nAdvanced Research Reactor due to the strong demands of texture measurement with\nneutrons from domestic user community. This neutron texture diffractometer has\nhigh neutron intensity, moderate resolution and is mainly applied to study the\ntexture in the commonly used industrial materials and engineering components.\nIn this paper, the design and characteristics of this instrument are described.\nThe results for calibration with neutrons and quantitative texture analysis of\nZr alloy plate are presented. The comparison of texture measurement among\ndifferent neutron texture diffractometer of HIPPO at LANSCE, Kowari at ANSTO\nand neutron texture diffractometer at CARR illustrates the reliable performance\nof this texture diffractometer.\n", "  We design fast protocols to separate or recombine two ions in a segmented\nPaul trap. By inverse engineering the time evolution of the trapping potential\ncomposed of a harmonic and a quartic term, it is possible to perform these\nprocesses in a few microseconds without final excitation. These times are much\nshorter than the ones reported so far experimentally. The design is based on\ndynamical invariants and dynamical normal modes. Anharmonicities beyond the\nharmonic approximation at potential minima are taken into account\nperturbatively. The stability versus an unknown potential bias is also studied.\n", "  An S band SLED-type pulse compressor has been manufactured by IHEP to\nchallenge the 100 MW maximum input power, which means the output peak power is\nabout 500 MW at the phase reversal time. In order to deal with the RF breakdown\nproblem, the dual side-wall coupling irises model was used. To further improve\nthe reliability at very high power, amplitude modulation and phase modulation\nwith flat-top output were taken into account. The RF modulation studies on an\nS-band SLED are presented in this paper. Furthermore, a method is developed by\nusing the CST Microwave Studio transient solver to simulate the time response\nof the pulse compressor, which can be a verification of the modulate theory. In\naddition, the experimental setup was constructed and the flat-top output is\nobtained in the low power tests.\n", "  A method is developed that allows analysis of quantum Monte Carlo simulations\nto identify errors in trial wave functions. The purpose of this method is to\nallow for the systematic improvement of variational wave functions by\nidentifying degrees of freedom that are not well-described by an initial trial\nstate. We provide proof of concept implementations of this method by\nidentifying the need for a Jastrow correlation factor, and implementing a\nselected multi-determinant wave function algorithm for small dimers that\nsystematically decreases the variational energy. Selection of the two-particle\nexcitations is done using quantum Monte Carlo within the presence of a Jastrow\ncorrelation factor, and without the need to explicitly construct the\ndeterminants. We also show how this technique can be used to design compact\nwave functions for transition metal systems. This method may provide a route to\nanalyze and systematically improve descriptions of complex quantum systems in a\nscalable way.\n", "  A new generation of storage ring-based light source, called\ndiffraction-limited storage ring (DLSR), with emittance approaching the\ndiffraction limit for multi-keV photons by means of multi-bend achromat\nlattice, has attracted worldwide and extensive studies. Among various DLSR\nproposals, the hybrid multi-bend achromat concept developed at ESRF predicts an\neffective way of minimizing the emittance and meanwhile keeping the required\nsextupole strengths to an achievable level. For the High Energy Photon Source\nplanned to be built in Beijing, an ESRF-type lattice design consisting of 48\nhybrid seven-bend achromats is proposed to reach emittance as low as 60 pm.rad\nwith a circumference of about 1296 m. Sufficient dynamic aperture promising\nvertical on-axis injection and moderate momentum acceptance are achieved\nsimultaneously for a promising ring performance.\n", "  A dedicated 4{\\pi}{\\beta} (LS)-{\\gamma} (HPGe)digital coincidence system has\nbeen developed in this work, which includes five acquisition channels. Three\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC) acquisition channels with an acquisition\nresolution of 8 bits and acquisition rate of 1GSPS (sample per second) are\nutilized to collect the signals from three Photo multiplier tubes (PMTs) which\nare adopted to detect {\\beta} decay, and two acquisition channels with an\nacquisition resolution of 16 bits and acquisition rate of 50MSPS are utilized\nto collect the signals from high-purity germanium (HPGe) which are adopted to\ndetect {\\gamma} decay. In order to increase the accuracy of the coincidence\nsystem, all the five acquisition channels are synchronous within 500ps. The\ndata collected by the five acquisition channels will be transmitted to the host\nPC through PCI bus and saved as a file. Off-line software is applied for the\n4{\\pi}{\\beta} (LS)-{\\gamma} (HPGe) coincidence and data analysis as needed in\npractical application. With all the above preconditions, the flexibility of the\nsystem is increased, and the structure and application of the system are\nsimplified. According to the test, the highest coincidence rate of the system\nis 20K per second, which is sufficient for most applications. This paper mainly\nintroduces the design of the hardware, the synchronization method and the test\nresult of this system.\n", "  The temperature dependent longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in heavy\nmetal (HM)/ Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) bilayers is investigated as a function of different\nmagnetic field strength, different HM detection material, and YIG thickness\nranging from nm to mm. A large enhancement of the SSE signal is observed at low\ntemperatures leading to a peak of the signal amplitude. We demonstrate that\nthis enhancement shows a clear dependence on the film thickness, being more\npronounced for thicker films and vanishing for films thinner than 600 nm. The\npeak temperature depends on the applied magnetic field strength as well as on\nthe detection material and interface, revealing a more complex behavior beyond\nthe currently discussed phonon-magnon coupling mechanism that considers only\nbulk effects. While the thickness dependence and magnetic field dependence can\nbe well explained in the framework of the magnon-driven SSE by taking into\naccount the frequency dependent propagation length of thermally excited magnons\nin the bulk material, the temperature dependence of the SSE is significantly\ninfluenced by the interface coupling to an adjacent detection layer. This\nindicates that previously neglected interface effects play a key role and that\nthe spin current traversing the interface and being detected in the HM depends\ndifferently on the magnon frequency for different HMs.\n", "  We explicitly compute the one-loop exact beta function for a nonlocal\nextension of the standard gauge theory, in particular Yang-Mills and QED. The\ntheory, made of a weakly nonlocal kinetic term and a local potential of the\ngauge field, is unitary (ghost-free) and perturbatively super-renormalizable.\nMoreover, in the action we can always choose the potential (consisting of one\n\"killer operator\") to make zero the beta function of running gauge coupling\nconstant. The outcome is \"a UV finite theory for any gauge interaction\". Our\ncalculations are done in D=4, but the results can be generalized to even or odd\nspacetime dimensions. We compute the contribution to the beta function from two\ndifferent killer operators by using two independent techniques, namely the\nFeynman diagrams and the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky traces. By making the theories\nfinite we are able to solve also the Landau pole problems, in particular in\nQED. Without any potential the beta function of the one-loop\nsuper-renormalizable theory shows a universal Landau pole in the running\ncoupling constant in the ultraviolet regime (UV), regardless of the specific\nhigher-derivative structure. However, the dressed propagator shows neither the\nLandau pole in the UV, nor the singularities in the infrared regime (IR).\n", "  Amplification of acoustic phonons due to an external temperature gredient\n($\\nabla T$) in Graphene was studied theoretically. The threshold temperature\ngradient $(\\nabla T)_0^{g}$ at which absorption switches over to amplification\nin Graphene was evaluated at various frequencies $\\omega_q$ and temperatures\n$T$. For $T = 77K$ and frequency $\\omega_q = 12THz$, $(\\nabla T)_0^{g} =\n0.37Km^{-1}$. The calculation was done in the regime at $ql >> 1$. The\ndependence of the normalized ($\\Gamma/\\Gamma_0$) on the frequency $\\omega_q$\nand the temperature gradient $(\\nabla T/T)$ are evaluated numerically and\npresented graphically. The calculated $(\\nabla T)_0^{g}$ for Graphene is lower\nthan that obtained for homogeneous semiconductors ($n-InSb$) $(\\nabla\nT)_0^{hom} \\approx 10^3Kcm^{-1}$, Superlattices $(\\nabla T)_0^{SL} =\n384Kcm^{-1}$, Cylindrical Quantum Wire $(\\nabla T)_0^{cqw} \\approx\n10^2Kcm^{-1}$. This makes Graphene a much better material for thermoelectric\nphonon amplifier.\n", "  We study the implications of the simplicity constraint in the spincube model\nof quantum gravity. By relating the edge-lengths to the integer areas of\ntriangles, the simplicity constraint imposes very strong restrictions between\nthem, ultimately leading to a requirement that all 4-simplices in the\ntriangulation must be almost mutually identical. As a surprising and unexpected\nconsequence of this property, one can obtain the CDT state sum as a special\ncase of the spincube state sum. This relationship brings new insight into the\nlong-standing problem of the relationship between the spinfoam approach and the\nCDT approach to quantum gravity. In particular, it turns out that the spincube\nmodel contains properties of both approaches, providing a single unifying\nframework for their analysis and comparison. In addition, the spincube state\nsum also contains some other special cases, very similar but not equivalent to\nthe CDT state sum.\n", "  Ray effects are the inherent problem of discrete ordinates method. RAY3D, a\nfunctional module of ARES which is a discrete ordinates code system, employs a\nsemi-analytic first collision source method to mitigate ray effects. This\nmethod decomposes the flux into uncollided and collided components, and then\ncalculates them with analytical method and discrete ordinates method\nrespectively. In this article, RAY3D is validated by the Kobayashi benchmarks\nand applied to the neutron beamline shielding problem of China Spallation\nNeutron Source (CSNS) target station. Numerical results of the Kobayashi\nbenchmarks indicate that DONTRAN3D with RAY3D solutions agree well with the\nMonte Carlo solutions. The dose rate at the end of the neutron beamline is less\nthan 10.83 {\\mu}Sv/h in CSNS target station neutron beamline shutter model.\nRAY3D can effectively mitigate ray effects and obtain relatively reasonable\nresults.\n", "  An improved method of energy calibration of position-sensitive silicon\ndetector is presented. Instead of the parabolic function used in traditional\nmethod, a new function describing the relation of position and energy is\nintroduced and achieves better energy resolution. For the 8.088 MeV alpha decay\nof 213Rn calibrated by this new method, the energy resolution is determined to\nbe about 87 keV (FWHM), which is better than the result of the traditional\nmethod, 104 keV (FWHM). In addition, different functions can be tried in the\nnew method, which makes the calibration of various detectors with different\nperformances possible.\n", "  We introduce a unitary matrix-product operator (UMPO) based variational\nmethod that approximately finds all the eigenstates of fully many-body\nlocalized (fMBL) one-dimensional Hamiltonians. The computational cost of the\nvariational optimization scales linearly with system size for a fixed bond\ndimension of the UMPO ansatz. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by\nconsidering the Heisenberg chain in a strongly disordered magnetic field for\nwhich we compare the approximation to exact diagonalization results.\n", "  A new Digital Pulse Processing (DPP) system, based on domino ring sampler\nversion 4 (DRS4), with good time resolution for the LaBr3 detectors has been\ndeveloped and different digital timing analysis methods for processing the\ndetector raw signals are reported. The system, composed of an eight channels\nDRS4 chip, was used as the readout electronic and acquisition system to process\nthe outputs signals from XP20D0 Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). The PMTs were\ncoupled with LaBr3 scintillator and placed on opposite side of the radioactive\npositron 22Na source for 511keV gama-ray test. By analyzing the raw data\nacquired by the system, the best coincidence timing resolution is about 194.7ps\n(FWHM), obtained by the digital constant fraction discrimination (dCFD) method\nand better than the other digital methods and analysis method based on the\nconventional analog systems. The results indicate that it is a promising\napproach to better localize the positron annihilation in the positron emission\ntomography (PET) with time of flight (TOF) and they are also suitable for the\nscintillation timing measurement, such as in TOF-DeltaE and TOF-E systems for\nparticle identification, with picosecond accuracy timing measurement.\nFurthermore, this system is more simple and convenient in comparison with other\nsystems.\n", "  Similar to electromagnetism, described by the Maxwell equations, the physics\nof magnetoelectric (ME) phenomena deals with the fundamental problem of the\nrelationship between electric and magnetic fields. Despite a formal resemblance\nbetween the two notions, they concern effects of different natures. In general,\nME coupling effects manifest in numerous macroscopic phenomena in solids with\nspace and time symmetry breakings. Recently it was shown that the near fields\nin the proximity of a small ferrite particle with magnetic dipolar mode (MDM)\noscillations have the space and time symmetry breakings and topological\nproperties of these fields are different from topological properties of the\nfree space electromagnetic (EM) fields. Such MDM originated fields, called\nmagnetoelectric (ME) fields, carry both spin and orbital angular momentums.\nThey are characterized by power flow vortices and non zero helicity. In this\npaper, we report on observation of the topological ME effects in far field\nmicrowave radiation based on a small microwave antenna with a MDM ferrite\nresonator. We show that the microwave far-field radiation can be manifested\nwith a torsion structure where an angle between the electric and magnetic field\nvectors varies. We discuss the question on observation of the regions of\nlocalized ME energy in far field microwave radiation.\n", "  Beam measurement is very important for accelerators. With the development of\nanalog-to-digital conversion techniques, digital beam measurement becomes a\nresearch hot spot. IQ (In-phase & Quadrature-phase) analysis based method is an\nimportant beam measurement approach, the principle of which is presented and\ndiscussed in this paper. The State Key Laboratory of Particle Detection and\nElectronics in University of Science and Technology of China has devoted\nefforts to the research of digital beam measurement based on high-speed\nhigh-resolution analog-to-digital conversion, and a series of beam measurement\ninstruments were designed for China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), Shanghai\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), and Accelerator Driven Sub-critical\nsystem (ADS).\n", "  We first review the accelerating, rotating and charged Plebanski-Demianski\n(PD) black hole, which includes the Kerr-Newman rotating black hole and the\nTaub-NUT spacetime. The main feature of this black hole is that it has 4\nhorizons like event horizon, Cauchy horizon and two accelerating horizons. In\nthe non-extremal case, the surface area, entropy, surface gravity, temperature,\nangular velocity, Komar energy and irreducible mass on the event horizon and\nCauchy horizon are presented for PD black hole. The entropy product,\ntemperature product, Komar energy product and irreducible mass product are\nfound for event horizon and Cauchy horizon. Also their sums are also found for\nboth horizons. All these relations are found to be depend on mass of the PD\nblack hole and other parameters. So all the products are not universal for PD\nblack hole. The entropy and area bounds for two horizons are investigated. Also\nwe found the Christodoulou-Ruffini mass for extremal PD black hole. Finally,\nusing first law of thermodynamics, we also found the Smarr relation for PD\nblack hole.\n", "  The chiral geometry of the multiple chiral doublet bands with identical\nconfiguration is discussed for different triaxial deformation parameters\n$\\gamma$ in the particle rotor model with $\\pi h_{11/2}\\otimes \\nu\nh_{11/2}^{-1}$. The energy spectra, electromagnetic transition probabilities\n$B(M1)$ and $B(E2)$, angular momenta, and $K$-distributions are studied. It is\ndemonstrated that the chirality still remains not only in the yrast and yrare\nbands, but also in the two higher excited bands when $\\gamma$ deviates from\n$30^{\\circ}$. The chiral geometry relies significantly on $\\gamma$, and the\nchiral geometry of the two higher excited partner bands is not as good as that\nof the yrast and yrare doublet bands.\n", "  Simulations of charge transport in amorphous semiconductors are often\nperformed in microscopically sized systems. As a result, charge carrier\nmobilities become system-size dependent. We propose a simple method for\nextrapolating a macroscopic, nondispersive mobility from the system-size\ndependence of a microscopic one. The method is validated against a\ntemperature-based extrapolation [Phys. Rev. B 82, 193202 (2010)]. In addition,\nwe provide an analytic estimate of system sizes required to perform\nnondispersive charge transport simulations in systems with finite charge\ncarrier density, derived from a truncated Gaussian distribution. This estimate\nis not limited to lattice models or specific rate expressions.\n", "  In the SSRF Phase-II beamline project, a Superconducting Wiggler (SW) will be\ninstalled in the electron storage ring. It may greatly impact on the beam\ndynamics due to the very high magnetic field. The emittance growth becomes a\nmain problem, even after a well correction of the beam optics. A local\nachromatic lattice is studied, in order to combat the emittance growth and keep\nthe good performance of the SSRF storage ring, as well as possible. Other\neffects of the SW are simulated and optimized as well, including the beta\nbeating, the tune shift, the dynamic aperture, and the field error effects.\n", "  The kicker control system was used for beam extraction and injection between\ntwo cooling storage rings (CSRs) at the Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou\n(HIRFL). To meet the requirements of special physics experiments, the kicker\ncontroller was upgraded. The new controller was designed based on ARM+DSP+FPGA\ntechnology and monolithic circuit architecture, which can achieve a precision\ntime delay of 2.5 ns. In September 2014, the new kicker control system was\ninstalled in the kicker field, and the test experiment using the system was\ncompleted. In addition, a pre-trigger signal was provided by the controller,\nwhich was designed to synchronize the beam diagnostic system and physics\nexperiments. Experimental results indicate that the phenomena of \"missed kick\"\nand \"inefficient kick\" were not observed, and the multichannel trigger signals'\ndelay could be adjusted individually for kick power supplies in digitization;\nthus, the beam transport efficiency was improved compared with that of the\noriginal system. The fast extraction and injection experiment was successfully\ncompleted based on the new kicker control systems for HIRFL-CSR.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is a fundamental quantum transport\nphenomenon that manifests as a quantized transverse conductance in response to\na longitudinally applied electric field in the absence of an external magnetic\nfield, and promises to have immense application potentials in future\ndissipation-less quantum electronics. Here we present a novel kinetic pathway\nto realize the QAHE at high temperatures by $n$-$p$ codoping of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators. We provide proof-of-principle\nnumerical demonstration of this approach using vanadium-iodine (V-I) codoped\nSb$_2$Te$_3$ and demonstrate that, strikingly, even at low concentrations of\n$\\sim$2\\% V and $\\sim$1\\% I, the system exhibits a quantized Hall conductance,\nthe tell-tale hallmark of QAHE, at temperatures of at least $\\sim$ 50 Kelvin,\nwhich is three orders of magnitude higher than the typical temperatures at\nwhich it has been realized so far. The proposed approach is conceptually\ngeneral and may shed new light in experimental realization of high-temperature\nQAHE.\n", "  The prompt gamma-ray spectrum from depleted uranium (DU) spherical shells\ninduced by 14 MeV D-T neutrons is measured. Monte Carlo (MC) simulation gives\nthe largest prompt gamma flux with the optimal thickness of the DU spherical\nshells 3-5 cm and the optimal frequency of neutron pulse 1 MHz. The method of\ntime of flight and pulse shape coincidence with energy (DC-TOF) is proposed,\nand the subtraction of the background gamma-rays discussed in detail. The\nelectron recoil spectrum and time spectrum of the prompt gamma-rays are\nobtained based on a 2\"*2\" BC501A liquid scintillator detector. The energy\nspectrum and time spectrum of prompt gamma-rays are obtained based on an\niterative unfolding method that can remove the influence of {\\gamma}-rays\nresponse matrix and pulsed neutron shape. The measured time spectrum and the\ncalculated results are roughly consistent with each other. Experimental prompt\ngamma-ray spectrum in the 0.4-3 MeV energy region agree well with MC simulation\nbased on the ENDF/BVI.5 library, and the discrepancies for the integral\nquantities of gamma-rays of energy 0.4-1 MeV and 1-3 MeV are 9.2% and 1.1%,\nrespectively.\n", "  To overcome the problem of inefficient computing time and unreliable results\nin MCNP5 calculation, a two-step method is adopted to calculate the energy\ndeposition of prompt gamma-rays in detectors for depleted uranium spherical\nshells under D-T neutrons irradiation. In the first step, the gamma-ray\nspectrum for energy below 7 MeV is calculated by MCNP5 code; secondly, the\nelectron recoil spectrum in a BC501A liquid scintillator detector is simulated\nbased on EGSnrc Monte Carlo Code with the gamma-ray spectrum from the first\nstep as input. The comparison of calculated results with experimental ones\nshows that the simulations agree well with experiment in the energy region\n0.4-3 MeV for the prompt gamma-ray spectrum and below 4 MeVee for the electron\nrecoil spectrum. The reliability of the two-step method in this work is\nvalidated.\n", "  Based on $J/\\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector, with\ncorresponding Monte Carlo samples, the tracking efficiency and its systematic\nuncertainty are studied using a control sample of $J/\\psi \\to p \\overline p\n\\pi^+ \\pi^-$. Validation methods and different factors influencing the tracking\nefficiency are presented in detail. The tracking efficiency and its systematic\nuncertainty for protons and pions with the transverse momentum and polar angle\ndependence are also discussed.\n", "  Electronic transport through a two-path triple-quantum-dot system with two\nsource leads and one drain is studied. By separating the conductance of the two\ndouble dot paths, we are able to observe double dot and triple dot physics in\ntransport and study the interaction between the paths. We observe channel\nblockade as a result of inter-channel Coulomb interaction. The experimental\nresults are understood with the help of a theoretical model which calculates\nthe parameters of the system, the stability regions of each state and the full\ndynamical transport in the triple dot resonances.\n", "  On 2014 Dec. 9.61, the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN or\n\"Assassin\") discovered ASASSN-14lp just $\\sim2$ days after first light using a\nglobal array of 14-cm diameter telescopes. ASASSN-14lp went on to become a\nbright supernova ($V = 11.94$ mag), second only to SN 2014J for the year. We\npresent prediscovery photometry (with a detection less than a day after first\nlight) and ultraviolet through near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data\ncovering the rise and fall of ASASSN-14lp for more than 100 days. We find that\nASASSN-14lp had a broad light curve ($\\Delta m_{15}(B) = 0.80 \\pm 0.05$), a\n$B$-band maximum at $2457015.82 \\pm 0.03$, a rise time of $16.94^{+ 0.11 }_{-\n0.10 }$ days, and moderate host--galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{\\textrm{host}} =\n0.33 \\pm 0.06$). Using ASASSN-14lp we derive a distance modulus for NGC 4666 of\n$\\mu = 30.8 \\pm 0.2$ corresponding to a distance of $14.7 \\pm 1.5$ Mpc.\nHowever, adding ASASSN-14lp to the calibrating sample of Type Ia supernovae\nstill requires an independent distance to the host galaxy. Finally, using our\nearly-time photometric and spectroscopic observations, we rule out red giant\nsecondaries and, assuming a favorable viewing angle and explosion time, any\nnon-degenerate companion larger than $0.34 R_{\\textrm{sun}}$.\n", "  Positron Emission Mammography (PEM) imaging systems with the ability in\ndetection of millimeter-sized tumors were developed in recent years. And some\nof them have been well used in clinical applications. In consideration of\nbiopsy application, a double-plane detector configuration is practical for the\nconvenience of breast immobilization. However, the serious blurring effect in\nthe double-plane system with changeable spacing for different breast size\nshould be studied. Methods: We study a high resolution reconstruction method\napplicable for a double-plane PET system with a changeable detector spacing.\nGeometric and blurring components should be calculated at real time for\ndifferent detector distance. Accurate geometric sensitivity is obtained with a\ntube area model. Resolution recovery is achieved by estimating blurring effects\nderived from simulated single gamma response information. Results: The results\nshow that the new geometric modeling gives a more finite and smooth sensitivity\nweight in double-plane system. The blurring component yields contrast recovery\nlevels that could not be reached without blurring modeling, as well as better\nvisual recovery of the smallest spheres and better delineation of the\nstructures in the reconstructed images. Statistical noise has lower variance at\nthe voxel level with blurring modeling than without at matched resolution.\nConclusion: In the distance-changeable double-plane PET, the finite resolution\nmodeling during reconstruction achieves resolution recovery, without noise\namplification.\n", "  We present weak-lensing mass measurements of 50 X-ray luminous galaxy\nclusters at $0.15\\le z\\le0.3$, based on uniform high quality observations with\nSuprime-Cam mounted on the 8.2-m Subaru telescope. We pay close attention to\npossible systematic biases, aiming to control them at the $\\le4$ per cent\nlevel. The dominant source of systematic bias in weak-lensing measurements of\nthe mass of individual galaxy clusters is contamination of background galaxy\ncatalogues by faint cluster and foreground galaxies. We extend our conservative\nmethod for selecting background galaxies with $(V-i')$ colours redder than the\nred sequence of cluster members to use a colour-cut that depends on\ncluster-centric radius. This allows us to define background galaxy samples that\nsuffer $\\le1$ per cent contamination, and comprise $13$ galaxies per square\narcminute. Thanks to the purity of our background galaxy catalogue, the largest\nsystematic that we identify in our analysis is a shape measurement bias of $3$\nper cent, that we measure using simulations that probe weak shears upto\n$g=0.3$. Our individual cluster mass and concentration measurements are in\nexcellent agreement with predictions of the mass-concentration relation.\nEqually, our stacked shear profile is in excellent agreement with the Navarro\nFrenk and White profile. Our new LoCuSS mass measurements are consistent with\nthe CCCP and CLASH surveys, and in tension with the Weighing the Giants at\n$\\sim1-2\\sigma$ significance. Overall, the consensus at $z\\le0.3$ that is\nemerging from these complementary surveys represents important progress for\ncluster mass calibration, and augurs well for cluster cosmology.\n", "  For calculation of cross sections for collisional transitions between\nrotational levels in a molecule, a computer code, MOLSCAT has been developed by\nHutson \\& Green (1994). For the transitions between rotational levels in\nH$_2$CS due to collisions with He atom, we have calculated cross sections under\nthe CS approximation. In the MOLSCAT, there is provision to input more than one\nvalues of total energies. Here, for example, we are interested in the cross\nsections for total energy 11 cm$^{-1}$. The calculations have been done for the\nsingle energy 11 cm$^{-1}$ and for eight combinations, having energies (11,\n12), (12, 11), (10, 11), (11, 10), (11, 12, 13), (9, 10, 11), (10, 11, 12), (9,\n10, 11, 12, 13) cm$^{-1}$. We have found that the cross sections for 11\ncm$^{-1}$, in general, differ from one another in all the 9 calculations. The\nreason for the difference in the results appears that the MOLSCAT uses the\nintermediate data of calculations for one energy, in the calculations for other\nenergies. Under such circumstances, the possible suggestion can be to run the\nMOLSCAT for a single energy at a time.\n", "  There have been long debates about the initial condition of inflationary\nperturbations. In this work we explicitly show the decay of excited states\nduring inflation via interactions. For this purpose, we note that the folded\nshape non-Gaussianity can be interpreted as the decay of the non-Bunch-Davies\ninitial condition. The one loop diagrams with non-Bunch-Davies propagators are\ncalculated to uncover the decay of such excited states. The observed smallness\nof non-Gaussianity keeps the window open for probing inflationary initial\nconditions and trans-Planckian physics.\n", "  Embedded RAM blocks (BRAMs) in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are\nsusceptible to single event effects (SEEs) induced by environmental factors\nsuch as cosmic rays, heavy ions, alpha particles and so on. As technology\nscales, the issue will be more serious. In order to tackle this issue, two\ndifferent error correcting codes (ECCs), the shortened Hamming codes and\nshortened BCH codes, are investigated in this paper. The concrete design\nmethods of the codes are presented. Also, the codes are both implemented in\nflash-based FPGAs. Finally, the synthesis report and simulation results are\npresented in the paper. Moreover, the heavy-ion experiments are performed, the\nexperimental results indicate that the error cross-section using the shortened\nHamming codes can be reduced by two orders of magnitude compared with the\ndevice without mitigation, and no errors are discovered in the experiments for\nthe device using the shortened BCH codes.\n", "  Magnetic quantum periodicity in the dc voltage is observed when asymmetric\nrings are switched between superconducting and normal state by a noise or ac\ncurrent. This quantum effect is used for detection of a non-equilibrium noise\nwith the help of a system of 667 asymmetric aluminum rings of $1 \\ \\mu m$ in\ndiameter connected in series. Any noise down to the equilibrium one can be\ndetected with the help of such system with enough great number of asymmetric\nrings.\n", "  We study four dimensional quiver gauge models from F-theory compactified on\nfourfolds with hyper-K\\\"{a}hler structure. Using intersecting complex toric\nsurfaces, we derive a class of N=1 quivers with charged fundamental matter\nplaced on external nodes. The emphasis is on how local Calabi-Yau equations\nsolve the corresponding physical constraints including the anomaly cancelation\ncondition. Concretely, a linear chain of SU(N) groups with flavor symmetries\nhas been constructed using polyvalent toric geometry.\n", "  We discuss two measures of entanglement in quantum field theory and their\nholographic realizations. For field theories admitting a global symmetry, we\nintroduce a global symmetry entanglement entropy, associated with the\npartitioning of the symmetry group. This quantity is proposed to be related to\nthe generalized holographic entanglement entropy defined via the partitioning\nof the internal space of the bulk geometry. The second measure of quantum field\ntheory entanglement is the field space entanglement entropy, obtained by\nintegrating out a subset of the quantum fields. We argue that field space\nentanglement entropy cannot be precisely realised geometrically in a\nholographic dual. However, for holographic geometries with interior decoupling\nregions, the differential entropy provides a close analogue to the field space\nentanglement entropy. We derive generic descriptions of such inner throat\nregions in terms of gravity coupled to massive scalars and show how the\ndifferential entropy in the throat captures features of the field space\nentanglement entropy.\n", "  We study possible spin liquids on square lattice that respect all lattice\nsymmetries and time-reversal symmetry within the framework of Schwinger boson\n(mean-field) theory. Such spin liquids have spin gap and emergent Z_2 gauge\nfield excitations. We classify them by the projective symmetry group method,\nand find six spin liquid states that are potentially relevant to the J_1-J_2\nHeisenberg model. The properties of these states are studied under mean-field\napproximation. Interestingly we find a spin liquid state that can go through\ncontinuous phase transitions to either the N\\'eel magnetic order or magnetic\norders of the wavevector at Brillouin zone edge center. We also discuss the\nconnection between our results and the Abrikosov fermion spin liquids.\n", "  Wave kinetic theory has been developed to describe the statistical dynamics\nof weakly nonlinear, dispersive waves. However, we show that systems which are\ngenerally dispersive can have resonant sets of wave modes with identical group\nvelocities, leading to a local breakdown of dispersivity. This shows up as a\ngeometric singularity of the resonant manifold and possibly as an infinite\nphase measure in the collision integral. Such singularities occur widely for\nclassical wave systems, including acoustical waves, Rossby waves, helical waves\nin rotating fluids, light waves in nonlinear optics and also in quantum\ntransport, e.g. kinetics of electron-hole excitations (matter waves) in\ngraphene. These singularities are the exact analogue of the critical points\nfound by Van Hove in 1953 for phonon dispersion relations in crystals. The\nimportance of these singularities in wave kinetics depends on the dimension of\nphase space $D=(N-2)d$ ($d$ physical space dimension, $N$ the number of waves\nin resonance) and the degree of degeneracy $\\delta$ of the critical points.\nFollowing Van Hove, we show that non-degenerate singularities lead to finite\nphase measures for $D>2$ but produce divergences when $D\\leq 2$ and possible\nbreakdown of wave kinetics if the collision integral itself becomes too large\n(or even infinite). Similar divergences and possible breakdown can occur for\ndegenerate singularities, when $D-\\delta\\leq 2,$ as we find for several\nphysical examples, including electron-hole kinetics in graphene. When the\nstandard kinetic equation breaks down, then one must develop a new singular\nwave kinetics. We discuss approaches from pioneering 1971 work of Newell \\&\nAucoin on multi-scale perturbation theory for acoustic waves and\nfield-theoretic methods based on exact Schwinger-Dyson integral equations for\nthe wave dynamics.\n", "  For a quantum channel (completely positive, trace-preserving map), we prove a\ngeneralization to the infinite dimensional case of a result by Baumgartner and\nNarnhofer. This result is, in a probabilistic language, a decomposition of a\ngeneral quantum channel into its irreducible positive recurrent components.\nThis decomposition is related with a communication relation on the reference\nHilbert space. This allows us to describe the full structure of invariant\nstates of a quantum channel, and of their supports.\n", "  It is suggested that in gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of about 5 nm sizes used in\nthe radiofrequency (RF) hyperthermia, an absorption of the RF photon by the\nFermi electron occurs with involvement of the longitudinal acoustic vibrational\nmode (LAVM), the dominating one in the distribution of vibrational density of\nstates (VDOS). This physical mechanism helps to explain two observed phenomena:\nthe size dependence of the heating rate (HR) in GNPs and reduced heat\nproduction in aggregated GNPs. The argumentation proceeds within the\none-electron approximation, taking into account the discretenesses of energies\nand momenta of both electrons and LAVMs. The heating of GNPs is thought to\nconsist of two consecutive processes: first, the Fermi electron absorbs\nsimultaneously the RF photon and the LAVM available in the GNP; hereafter the\nexcited electron gets relaxed within the GNP's boundary, exciting a LAVM with\nthe energy higher than that of the previously absorbed LAVM. GNPs containing\nthe Ta and/or Fe impurities are proposed for the RF hyperthermia as promising\nheaters with enhanced HRs, and GNPs with rare-earth impurity atoms are also\nbrought into consideration. It is shown why the maximum HR values should be\nexpected in GNPs with about 5-7 nm size.\n", "  Bound and resonance states of helium atom have been investigated inside a\nquantum dot by using explicitly correlated Hylleraas type basis set within the\nframework of stabilization method. To be specific, precise energy eigenvalues\nof bound 1sns (1Se) [n = 1-6] states and the resonance parameters i.e.\npositions and widths of 1Se states due to 2sns [n = 2-5] and 2pnp [n = 2-5]\nconfiguration of confined helium below N = 2 ionization threshold of He+ have\nbeen estimated. The two-parameter (Depth and Width) finite oscillator potential\nis used to represent the confining potential representing the quantum dot. It\nhas been explicitly demonstrated that electronic structure properties become a\nsensitive function of the dot size. It is observed from the calculations of\nionization potential that the stability of an impurity ion within quantum dot\nmay be manipulated by varying the confinement parameters. A possibility of\ncontrolling the autoionization lifetime of doubly excited states of\ntwo-electron ions by tuning the width of the quantum cavity is also discussed\nhere.\n", "  Supermassive black hole dynamics during galaxy mergers is crucial in\ndetermining the rate of black hole mergers and cosmic black hole growth. As\nsimulations achieve higher resolution, it becomes important to assess whether\nthe black hole dynamics is influenced by the treatment of the interstellar\nmedium in different simulation codes. We here compare simulations of black hole\ngrowth in galaxy mergers with two codes: the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\ncode Gasoline, and the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code Ramses. We seek to\nidentify predictions of these models that are robust despite differences in\nhydrodynamic methods and implementations of sub-grid physics. We find that the\ngeneral behavior is consistent between codes. Black hole accretion is minimal\nwhile the galaxies are well-separated (and even as they \"fly-by\" within 10 kpc\nat first pericenter). At late stages, when the galaxies pass within a few kpc,\ntidal torques drive nuclear gas inflow that triggers bursts of black hole\naccretion accompanied by star formation. We also note quantitative\ndiscrepancies that are model-dependent: our Ramses simulations show less star\nformation and black hole growth, and a smoother gas distribution with larger\nclumps and filaments, than our Gasoline simulations. We attribute these\ndifferences primarily to the sub-grid models for black hole fueling and\nfeedback and gas thermodynamics. The main conclusion is that differences exist\nquantitatively between codes, and this should be kept in mind when making\ncomparisons with observations. However, reassuringly, both codes capture the\nsame dynamical behaviors in terms of triggering of black hole accretion, star\nformation, and black hole dynamics.\n", "  Using a grid of $\\sim 2$ million elements ($\\Delta z = 0.005$) adapted from\nCOSMOS photometric redshift (photo-z) searches, we investigate the general\nproperties of template-based photo-z likelihood surfaces. We find these\nsurfaces are filled with numerous local minima and large degeneracies that\ngenerally confound rapid but \"greedy\" optimization schemes, even with\nadditional stochastic sampling methods. In order to robustly and efficiently\nexplore these surfaces, we develop BAD-Z [Brisk Annealing-Driven Redshifts\n(Z)], which combines ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with\nsimulated annealing to sample arbitrarily large, pre-generated grids in\napproximately constant time. Using a mock catalog of 384,662 objects, we show\nBAD-Z samples $\\sim 40$ times more efficiently compared to a brute-force\ncounterpart while maintaining similar levels of accuracy. Our results represent\nfirst steps toward designing template-fitting photo-z approaches limited mainly\nby memory constraints rather than computation time.\n", "  Detailed investigations on the notch technique are performed on the ideal\ndata generated by the optical model potential parameters extracted from the\n16O+208Pb system at the laboratory energy of 129.5 MeV, to study the\nsensitivities of this technique on the model parameters as well as the\nexperimental data. It is found that, for the perturbation parameters, a\nsufficient large reduced fraction and an appropriate small perturbation width\nare necessary to determine the accurate radial sensitivity; while for the\npotential parameters, almost no dependence was observed. For the experimental\nmeasurements, the number of data points has little influence for the heavy\ntarget system, and the relative inner information of the nuclear potential can\nbe derived when the measurement extended to a lower cross section.\n", "  With the constant increase of accelerator luminosity, the rate requirements\nof the MRPC detectors become important. In the same time, aging problem of the\ndetector has to be studied meticulously. An online aging test system is set up\nin our Lab. The setup of the system is described and the purpose is to study\nthe performance stability during the long time running under high luminosity\nenvironment. The high rate MRPC has been irradiated by X-ray for 36 days and\naccumulated charge density reached 0.1C/cm2. No obvious performance degradation\nis observed for the detector.\n", "  We are exploring a generic strongly-interacting Electroweak Symmetry Breaking\nSector (EWSBS) with the low-energy effectie field theory for the four\nexperimentally known particles ($W_L^\\pm$, $Z_L$, $h$) and its\ndispersion-relation based unitary extension. In this contribution we provide\nsimple estimates for the production cross section of pairs of the EWSBS bosons\nand their resonances at proton-proton colliders as well as in a future $e^-e^+$\n(or potentially a $\\mu^-\\mu^+$) collider with a typical few-TeV energy. We\nexamine the simplest production mechanisms, tree-level production through a $W$\n(dominant when quantum numbers allow) and the simple effective boson\napproximation (in which the electroweak bosons are considered as collinear\npartons of the colliding fermions). We exemplify with custodial isovector and\nisotensor resonances at 2 TeV, the energy currently being discussed because of\na slight excess in the ATLAS 2-jet data. We find it hard, though not\nunthinkable, to ascribe this excess to one of these $W_LW_L$ rescattering\nresonances. An isovector resonance could be produced at a rate smaller than,\nbut close to earlier CMS exclusion bounds, depending on the parameters of the\neffective theory. The $ZZ$ excess is then problematic and requires additional\nphysics (such as an additional scalar resonance). The isotensor one (that would\ndescribe all charge combinations) has a smaller cross section.\n", "  We propose using nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer (NMZI) to efficiently\nprepare photonic quantum states from a classical input. We first analytically\ninvestigate the simple NMZI that can filtrate single photon state from weak\ncoherent state by preferrentially blocking two-photon component. As a\ngeneralization, we show that the cascaded NMZI can deterministically extract\narbitrary quantum state from a strong coherent state. Finally, we numerically\ndemonstrate that the cascaded NMZI can be very efficient in both the input\npower and the level of cascade. The protocol of quantum state preparation with\nNMZI can be extended to various systems of bosonic modes.\n", "  We introduce a definition of the electromagnetic chirality of an object and\nshow that it has an upper bound. Reciprocal objects attain the upper bound if\nand only if they are transparent for all the fields of one polarization\nhandedness (helicity). Additionally, electromagnetic duality symmetry, i.e.,\nhelicity preservation upon interaction, turns out to be a necessary condition\nfor reciprocal objects to attain the upper bound. We use these results to\nprovide requirements for the design of such extremal objects. The requirements\ncan be formulated as constraints on the polarizability tensors for dipolar\nobjects or on the material constitutive relations for continuous media. We also\noutline two applications for objects of maximum electromagnetic chirality: a\ntwofold resonantly enhanced and background-free circular dichroism measurement\nsetup, and angle-independent helicity filtering glasses. Finally, we use the\ntheoretically obtained requirements to guide the design of a specific\nstructure, which we then analyze numerically and discuss its performance with\nrespect to maximal electromagnetic chirality.\n", "  We examine the competition between the charge-density wave (CDW) instability\nand the excitonic condensate (EC) in spatially separated layers of electrons\nand holes. The CDW and the EC order parameters (OPs), described by two\ndifferent mechanisms and hence two different transition temperatures\n$T^{CDW}_c$ and $T^{EC}_c$, are self-consistently coupled by a microscopic mean\nfield theory. We discuss the results in our model specifically focusing on the\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides which are considered as the most typical\nexamples of strongly coupled CDW/EC systems with atomic layer separations where\nthe electronic energy scales are large with the critical temperatures in the\nrange $T^{EC}_c \\sim T^{CDW}_c \\sim 100-200 K$. An important consequence of\nthis is that the excitonic energy gap, hence the condensed free energy, vary\nwith the layer separation resulting in a new type of force ${\\cal F}_{EC}$. We\ndiscuss the possibility of this force as the possible driver of the structural\nlattice deformation observed in some TMDCs with a particular attention on the $\n1 {\\it T}$-$TiSe_2$ below $200 K$.\n", "  Synchrotron diffraction as a function of temperature and pressure, specific\nheat, magnetic susceptibility and small-angle neutron scattering experiments\nhave revealed an anomalous response of MnGe. Similar but less pronounced\nbehavior has also been observed in Mn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Ge and Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge\nsolid solutions. Spin density fluctuations and Mn spin state instability are\ndiscussed as possible candidates for the observed effects.\n", "  Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of matter have been interpreted\nin terms of anomalies, and it has been expected that a similar picture should\nhold for SPT phases with fermions. Here, we describe in detail what this\npicture means for phases of quantum matter that can be understood via band\ntheory and free fermions. The main examples we consider are time-reversal\ninvariant topological insulators and superconductors in 2 or 3 space\ndimensions. Along the way, we clarify the precise meaning of the statement that\nin the bulk of a 3d topological insulator, the electromagnetic $\\theta$-angle\nis equal to $\\pi$.\n", "  We study bosonic atoms with two internal states in artificial gauge\npotentials whose strengths are different for the two components. A series of\ntopological phases for such systems is proposed using the composite fermion\ntheory and the parton construction. It is found in exact diagonalization that\nsome of the proposed states may be realized for simple contact interaction\nbetween bosons. The ground states and low-energy excitations of these states\nare modeled using trial wave functions. The effective field theories for these\nstates are also constructed and reveal some interesting properties.\n", "  A 760 $\\times$ 760 $\\times$ 30 mm$^3$ plastic scintillation detector viewed\nby photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) from four corners has been developed, and the\ndetector has been tested with cosmic rays and $\\gamma$ rays. A\nposition-independent effective time T$_{eff}$ has been found, indicating this\ndetector can be used as a TOF detector. The hit position can also be\nreconstructed by the time from four corners. A TOF resolution of 236 ps and a\nposition resolution of 48 mm have been achieved, and the detection efficiency\nhas also been investigated.\n", "  The isotropic spin one-half XY chain in transverse field (XX chain) has\nspecific ground state phase with permanent criticality (quasi-long-range\nordered, QLRO, phase) which exists in a field less than nearest-neighbor\nexchange. It is characterized by gapless excitations and power law decay of\ntransverse correlators. The dilution of XX chain has drastic effect on this\nphase: the infinite series of quantum phase transitions marked by magnetization\njumps appears in it. The thermodynamics of dilute XX chain allows exact\nanalytical description revealing the peculiarities of the appearing\ntransitions. We calculate the low-temperature magnetization, entropy,\nlongitudinal magnetic susceptibility and specific heat of dilute model to\nelucidate the influence of quantum transitions on their field and\nlow-temperature behavior. The changes of pair spin correlators under dilution\nare also analyzed. We argue that other dilute quantum spin chains and ladders\nwith the gapless (algebraic) spin-liquid states would also exhibit the quantum\njumps under variation of couplings and field similar to those of XX chain.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory of the superconducting proximity effect in a\nsemiconducting thin film with spin-orbit interaction ($N_{SO}$) in an external\nmagnetic field. We demonstrate that an effective 1D Hamiltonian which describes\ninduced superconductivity in $N_{SO}$ in contact with a usual $s$-wave\nsuperconductor possesses not only spin-singlet induced superconducting order\nparameter term, as commonly adopted, but spin triplet order parameter term\nalso. Using this new effective Hamiltonian we confirm previous results for a\nnormal current across contacts of $N_{SO}$ with a normal metal and for a\nJosephson current with the same $N_{SO}$ with induced superconductivity,\nobtained previously in the framework of the phenomenological Hamiltonian\nwithout spin-triplet terms. However, a calculated current-phase relation across\nthe transparent contact between $N_{SO}$ with induced superconductivity in\nmagnetic field and usual $s$-wave superconductor differs significantly from\nprevious results. We suggest the experiment which can confirm our theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  We explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled zig-zag chains of\ntrapped ions in a double well potential. Following a quench of the potential\nbarrier between both wells, the induced coupling between both chains due to the\nlong-range interaction of the ions leads to their complete melting. The\nresulting dynamics is however not exclusively irregular but leads to phases of\nmotion during which various ordered structures appear with ions arranged in\narcs, lines and crosses. We quantify the emerging order by introducing a\nsuitable measure and complement our analysis of the ion dynamics using a normal\nmode analysis showing a decisive population transfer between only a few\ndistinguished modes.\n", "  We provide a contour integral formula for the exact partition function of\n${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric $U(N)$ gauge theories on compact toric\nfour-manifolds by means of supersymmetric localisation. We perform the explicit\nevaluation of the contour integral for $U(2)$ ${\\cal N}=2$ theory on\n$\\mathbb{P}^2$ for all instanton numbers. In the zero mass case, corresponding\nto the ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory, we obtain the generating\nfunction of the Euler characteristics of instanton moduli spaces in terms of\nmock-modular forms. In the decoupling limit of infinite mass we find that the\ngenerating function of local and surface observables computes equivariant\nDonaldson invariants, thus proving in this case a long-standing conjecture by\nN. Nekrasov. In the case of vanishing first Chern class the resulting\nequivariant Donaldson polynomials are new.\n", "  We report on new p$(e,e^\\prime p)\\pi^\\circ$ measurements at the\n$\\Delta^{+}(1232)$ resonance at the low momentum transfer region. The mesonic\ncloud dynamics is predicted to be dominant and rapidly changing in this\nkinematic region offering a test bed for chiral effective field theory\ncalculations. The new data explore the low $Q^2$ dependence of the resonant\nquadrupole amplitudes while extending the measurements of the Coulomb\nquadrupole amplitude to the lowest momentum transfer ever reached. The results\ndisagree with predictions of constituent quark models and are in reasonable\nagreement with dynamical calculations that include pion cloud effects, chiral\neffective field theory and lattice calculations. The reported measurements\nsuggest that improvement is required to the theoretical calculations and\nprovide valuable input that will allow their refinements.\n", "  Some of the operator product expansions (OPEs) between the lowest 16 higher\nspin currents of spins (1, 3/2, 3/2, 3/2, 3/2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5/2, 5/2, 5/2,\n5/2, 3) in an extension of the large N=4 linear superconformal algebra were\nconstructed in the N=4 superconformal coset SU(5)/SU(3) theory previously. In\nthis paper, by rewriting the above OPEs in the N=4 superspace developed by\nSchoutens (and other groups), the remaining undetermined OPEs where the\ncorresponding singular terms possess the composite fields with spins s =7/2, 4,\n9/2, 5 are completely determined. Furthermore, by introducing the arbitrary\ncoefficients in front of the composite fields in the right hand sides of the\nabove complete 136 OPEs, reexpressing them in the N=2 superspace and using the\nN=2 OPEs mathematica package by Krivonos and Thielemans, the complete\nstructures of the above OPEs with fixed coefficient functions are obtained with\nthe help of various Jacobi identities. Then one obtains ten N=2 super OPEs\nbetween the four N=2 higher spin currents denoted by (1, 3/2, 3/2, 2), (3/2, 2,\n2, 5/2), (3/2, 2, 2, 5/2) and (2, 5/2, 5/2, 3) (corresponding 136 OPEs in the\ncomponent approach) in the N=4 superconformal coset SU(N+2)/SU(N) theory.\nFinally, one describes them as one single N=4 super OPE between the above\nsixteen higher spin currents in the N=4 superspace. The fusion rule for this\nOPE contains the next 16 higher spin currents of spins of (2, 5/2, 5/2, 5/2,\n5/2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7/2, 7/2, 7/2, 7/2, 4) in addition to the quadratic N=4\nlowest higher spin multiplet and the large N=4 linear superconformal family of\nthe identity operator. The various structure constants (fixed coefficient\nfunctions) appearing in the right hand side of this OPE depend on N and the\nlevel k of the bosonic spin-1 affine Kac-Moody current.\n", "  Recent Spitzer/InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) photometric observations have\nrevealed that rest-frame optical emission lines contribute signficantly to the\nbroadband fluxes of high-redshift galaxies. Specifically, in the narrow\nredshift range z~5.1-5.4 the [3.6]-[4.5] color is expected to be very red, due\nto contamination of the 4.5-micron band by the dominant Halpha line, while the\n3.6-micron filter is free of nebular emission lines. We take advantage of new\nreductions of deep Spitzer/IRAC imaging over the GOODS-North+South fields\n(Labbe+2015) to obtain a clean measurement of the mean Halpha equivalent width\nfrom the [3.6]-[4.5] color in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4. The selected\nsources either have measured spectroscopic redshifts (13 sources) or lie very\nconfidently in the redshift range z=5.1-5.4 based on the photometric redshift\nlikelihood intervals (11 sources). Our z_{phot}=5.1-5.4 sample and\nz_{spec}=5.10-5.40 spectroscopic sample have a mean [3.6]-[4.5] color of\n0.31+/-0.05 mag and 0.35+/-0.07 mag, implying a rest-frame equivalent width\nEW(Halpha+[NII]+[SII]) of 665+/-53 Angstroms and 707+/-74 Angstroms,\nrespectively, for sources in these samples. These values are consistent albeit\nslightly higher than derived by Stark+2013 at z~4, suggesting an evolution to\nhigher values of the Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW at z>2. Using the 3.6micron band,\nwhich is free of emission line contamination, we perform robust SED fitting and\nfind a median specific star formation rate of sSFR = 17_{-5}^{+2} Gyr^{-1},\n7_{-2}^{+1}x higher than at z~2. We find no strong correlation (<2sigma)\nbetween the Halpha+[NII]+[SII] EW and the stellar mass of sources. Before the\nadvent of JWST, improvements in these results will come through an expansion of\ncurrent spectroscopic samples and deeper Spitzer/IRAC measurements.\n", "  The requirement of a large number of electronic channels poses a big\nchallenge for Micro-pattern Gas Detector (MPGD) to achieve good spatial\nresolution. By using the redundancy that at least two neighboring strips record\nthe signal of a particle, a novel method of encoded multiplexing readout for\nMPGDs is presented in this paper. The method offers a feasible and\neasily-extensible way of encoding and decoding, and can significantly reduce\nthe number of readout channels. A verification test was carried out on a 5*5\ncm2 Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) detector using a 8 keV Cu X-ray\nsource with 100um slit, where 166 strips are read out by 21 encoded readout\nchannels. The test results show a good linearity in its position response, and\nthe spatial resolution root-mean-square (RMS) of the test system is about 260\n{\\mu}m. This method has an attractive potential to build large area detectors\nand can be easily adapted to other detectors like MPGDs.\n", "  We present a theoretical investigation of the electronic structure of rutile\n(metallic) and M$_1$ and M$_2$ monoclinic (insulating) phases of VO$_2$\nemploying a fully self-consistent combination of density functional theory and\nembedded dynamical mean field theory calculations. We describe the electronic\nstructure of the metallic and both insulating phases of VO$_2$, and propose a\ndistinct mechanism for the gap opening. We show that Mott physics plays an\nessential role in all phases of VO$_2$: undimerized vanadium atoms undergo\nclassical Mott transition through local moment formation (in the M$_2$ phase),\nwhile strong superexchange within V-dimers adds significant dynamic intersite\ncorrelations, which remove the singularity of self-energy for dimerized\nV-atoms. The resulting transition from rutile to dimerized M$_1$ phase is\nadiabatically connected to Peierls-like transition, but is better characterized\nas the Mott transition in the presence of strong intersite exchange. As a\nconsequence of Mott physics, the gap in the dimerized M$_1$ phase is\ntemperature dependent. The sole increase of electronic temperature collapses\nthe gap, reminiscent of recent experiments.\n", "  We study non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of a Gaussian dynamical system\nand compute in closed form the large deviation functionals describing the\nfluctuations of the entropy production observable with respect to the reference\nstate and the non-equilibrium steady state. The entropy production observable\nof this model is an unbounded function on the phase space, and its large\ndeviation functionals have a surprisingly rich structure. We explore this\nstructure in some detail.\n", "  We engineer the fast rotation of a quantum particle confined in an\neffectively one-dimensional, harmonic trap, for a predetermined rotation angle\nand time, avoiding final excitation. Different schemes are proposed with\ndifferent speed limits that depend on the control capabilities. We also make\nuse of trap rotations to create squeezed states without manipulating the trap\nfrequencies.\n", "  Post LSND results, sterile neutrinos have drawn attention and motivated the\nhigh energy physics, astronomy and cosmology to probe physics beyond the\nstandard model considering minimal 3+1 (3 active and 1 sterile) to 3+N neutrino\nschemes. The analytical equations for neutrino conversion probabilities are\ndeveloped in this work for 3+1 neutrino scheme. Here, we have tried to explore\nthe possible signals of T and CPT violations with four flavor neutrino scheme\nat neutrino factory. Values of sterile parameters considered in this analysis\nare taken from two different types of neutrino experiments viz. long baseline\nexperiments and reactor+atmospheric experiments. In this work golden and\ndiscovery channels are selected for the investigation of T violation. While\nobserving T violation we stipulate that neutrino factory working at 50 GeV\nenergy have the potential to observe the T violation signatures for the\nconsidered range of baselines(3000 km-7500 km). The ability of neutrino factory\nfor constraining CPT violation is enhanced with increase in energy for normal\nneutrino mass hierarchy(NH). Neutrino factory with the exposure time of 500\nkt-yr will be able to capture CPT violation with $ \\delta c_{31}\\geq\n3.6\\times10^{-23} $ GeV at 3$ \\sigma $ level for NH and for IH with $ \\delta\nc_{31}\\geq 4\\times10^{-23} $ GeV at 3$ \\sigma $ level.\n", "  When emission in a conical relativistic jet ceases abruptly (or decays\nsharply), the observed decay light curve is controlled by the high-latitude\n\"curvature effect\". Recently, Uhm & Zhang found that the decay slopes of three\nGRB X-ray flares are steeper than what the standard model predicts. This\nrequires bulk acceleration of the emission region, which is consistent with a\nPoynting-flux-dominated outflow. In this paper, we systematically analyze a\nsample of 85 bright X-ray flares detected in 63 Swift GRBs, and investigate the\nrelationship between the temporal decay index $\\alpha$ and spectral index\n$\\beta$ during the steep decay phase of these flares. The $\\alpha$ value\ndepends on the choice of the zero time point $t_0$. We adopt two methods.\n\"Method I\" takes $t_0^I$ as the first rising data point of each flare, and is\nthe most conservative approach. We find that at 99.9% condifence level 56/85\nflares have decay slopes steeper than the simplest curvature effect prediction,\nand therefore, are in the acceleration regime. \"Method II\" extrapolates the\nrising light curve of each flare backwards until the flux density is three\norders of magnitude lower than the peak flux density, and defines the\ncorresponding time as the time zero point (t_0^II). We find that 74/85 flares\nfall into the acceleration regime at 99.9% condifence level. This suggests that\nbulk acceleration is common, may be even ubiquitous among X-ray flares,\npointing towards a Poynting-flux-dominated jet composition for these events.\n", "  In this paper we argue that minimal supergravity with flat K\\\"ahler metric\nand a power-law superpotential can relate the Super-Higgs mechanism for the\nlocal spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and the cosmological tracking\nsolution, leading in turn to a late-time accelerated expansion of the universe\nand alleviating the coincidence problem.\n", "  We construct infinitely many examples of pairs of isospectral but\nnon-isometric $1$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifolds. These examples have infinite\ndiscrete spectrum and the same Eisenstein series. Our constructions are based\non an application of Sunada's method in the cusped setting, and so in addition\nour pairs are finite covers of the same degree of a 1-cusped hyperbolic\n3-orbifold (indeed manifold) and also have the same complex length-spectra.\nFinally we prove that any finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold isospectral to\nthe figure-eight knot complement is homeomorphic to the figure-eight knot\ncomplement.\n", "  Coupled surface plasmon/phonon polaritons and hyperbolic modes are known to\nenhance radiative transport across nanometer vacuum gaps but usually require\nidentical materials. It becomes crucial to achieve strong near-field energy\ntransfer between dissimilar materials for applications like near-field\nthermophotovoltaic and thermal rectification. In this work, we theoretically\ndemonstrate extraordinary near-field radiative transport between a\nnanostructured metamaterial emitter and a graphene-covered planar receiver.\nStrong near-field coupling with two orders of magnitude enhancement in the\nspectral heat flux is achieved at the gap distance of 20 nm. By carefully\nselecting the graphene chemical potential and doping levels of silicon nanohole\nemitter and silicon plate receiver, the total near-field radiative heat flux\ncan reach about 500 times higher than the far-field blackbody limit between 400\nK and 300 K. The physical mechanisms are elucidated by the near-field surface\nplasmon coupling with fluctuational electrodynamics and dispersion relations.\nThe effects of graphene chemical potential, emitter and receiver doping levels,\nand vacuum gap distance on the near-field coupling and radiative transfer are\nanalyzed in detail.\n", "  1H 0707-495 is the most convincing example of a supermassive black hole with\nan X-ray spectrum being dominated by extremely smeared, relativistic\nreflection, with the additional requirement of strongly supersoler iron\nabundance. However, here we show that the iron features in its 2--10 keV\nspectrum are rather similar to the archetypal wind dominated source, PDS 456.\nWe fit all the 2--10 keV spectra from 1H 0707-495 using the same wind model as\nused for PDS 456, but viewed at higher inclination so that the iron absorption\nline is broader but not so blueshifted. This gives a good overall fit to the\ndata from 1H 0707-495, and an extrapolation of this model to higher energies\nalso gives a good match to the NuSTAR data. Small remaining residuals indicate\nthat the iron line emission is stronger than in PDS 456. This is consistent\nwith the wider angle wind expected from a continuum driven wind from the\nsuper-Eddington mass accretion rate in 1H 0707-495, and/or the presence of\nresidual reflection from the underlying disk though the presence of the\nabsorption line in the model removes the requirement for highly relativistic\nsmearing, and highly supersoler iron abundance. We suggest that the spectrum of\n1H 0707-495 is sculpted more by absorption in a wind than by extreme\nrelativistic effects in strong gravity.\n", "  We construct a catalogue for filaments using a novel approach called SCMS\n(subspace constrained mean shift; Ozertem & Erdogmus 2011; Chen et al. 2015).\nSCMS is a gradient-based method that detects filaments through density ridges\n(smooth curves tracing high-density regions). A great advantage of SCMS is its\nuncertainty measure, which allows an evaluation of the errors for the detected\nfilaments. To detect filaments, we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nwhich consist of three galaxy samples: the NYU main galaxy sample (MGS), the\nLOWZ sample and the CMASS sample. Each of the three dataset covers different\nredshift regions so that the combined sample allows detection of filaments up\nto z = 0.7. Our filament catalogue consists of a sequence of two-dimensional\nfilament maps at different redshifts that provide several useful statistics on\nthe evolution cosmic web. To construct the maps, we select spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxies within 0.050 < z < 0.700 and partition them into 130 bins.\nFor each bin, we ignore the redshift, treating the galaxy observations as a 2-D\ndata and detect filaments using SCMS. The filament catalogue consists of 130\nindividual 2-D filament maps, and each map comprises points on the detected\nfilaments that describe the filamentary structures at a particular redshift. We\nalso apply our filament catalogue to investigate galaxy luminosity and its\nrelation with distance to filament. Using a volume-limited sample, we find\nstrong evidence (6.1$\\sigma$ - 12.3$\\sigma$) that galaxies close to filaments\nare generally brighter than those at significant distance from filaments.\n", "  In this work we analyze the validity of Lifshitz's theory for the case of\nnon-equilibrium scenarios from a full quantum dynamical approach. We show that\nLifshitz's framework for the study of the Casimir pressure is the result of\nconsidering the long-time regime (or steady state) of a well-defined fully\nquantized problem, subjected to initial conditions for the electromagnetic\nfield interacting with real materials. For this, we implement the closed time\npath formalism developed in previous works to study the case of two half spaces\n(modeled as composite environments, consisting in quantum degrees of freedom\nplus thermal baths) interacting with the electromagnetic field. Starting from\ninitial uncorrelated free subsystems, we solve the full time evolution,\nobtaining general expressions for the different contributions to the pressure\nthat take part on the transient stage. Using the analytic properties of the\nretarded Green functions, we obtain the long-time limit of these contributions\nto the total Casimir pressure. We show that, in the steady state, only the\nbaths' contribute, in agreement with the results of previous works, where this\nwas assumed without justification. We also study in detail the physics of the\ninitial conditions' contribution and the concept of modified vacuum modes,\ngiving insights about in which situations one would expect a non vanishing\ncontribution at the steady state of a non-equilibrium scenario. This would be\nthe case when considering finite width slabs instead of half-spaces.\n", "  The thermal stability and separation characteristic of anti-sticking layers\nof Pt/Cr films were studied in this paper. Several types of adhesion layers\nwere investigated: 10.0 nm Pt, 1.5 nm Cr+50.0 nm Pt, 2.5 nm Cr+50.0 nm Pt and\n3.5 nm Cr+50.0 nm Pt fabricated using direct current magnetron sputtering. The\nvariation of layer thicknesses, roughness, crystallization and surface\ntopography of Pt/Cr films have been analyzed by grazing incidence X-ray\nreflectometry, large angle X-ray diffraction and the optical profiler before\nand after heating. 2.5 nm Cr+50.0 nm Pt films exhibit the best thermal\nstability and separation characteristic according to the heating and hot\nslumping experiments. The films were also applied as anti-sticking layers to\noptimize the maximum temperature of hot slumping technology.\n", "  New analytic spin chains with fractional revival are introduced. Their\nnearest-neighbor couplings and local magnetic fields correspond to the\nrecurrence coefficients of para-Racah polynomials which are orthogonal on\nquadratic bi-lattices. These models generalize the spin chain associated to the\ndual-Hahn polynomials. Instances where perfect state transfer also occurs are\nidentified.\n", "  The baseline design for the High Energy Photon Source has been proposed, with\nan emittance of 60 pm.rad within a circumference of 1.3 kilometers.\nNevertheless, the nonlinear performance of the design needs further\nimprovements to enlarge both the dynamic aperture and the momentum acceptance.\nIn this study, genetic optimization of the linear optics is performed, so as to\nfind all the possible solutions with weaker sextupoles and hence weaker\nnonlinearities, while keeping the emittance at the same level as the baseline\ndesign. These obtained solutions enable us to explore the dependence of\nnonlinear dynamics on the working point. The result indicates that with the\nsame layout, it is feasible to obtain much better nonlinear performance with a\ndelicate tuning of the magnetic field strengths and a wise choice of the\nworking point.\n", "  In this paper we will show a cavity and higher order mode (HOM) coupler\ndesigning scheme for the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) main ring.\nThe cavity radio frequency (RF) design parameters are showed in this paper. The\nHOM power is calculated based on the beam parameters in the Preliminary\nConceptual Design Report (Pre-CDR). The damping results of the higher order\nmodes (HOMs) and same order modes (SOMs) show that they are reached the damping\nrequirements for beam stability.\n", "  The spatial resolution of laterally segmented electromagnetic calorimeters is\nstudied on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations worked-out for lead fluoride\nmaterial. Parametrization of the relative resolution is proposed and optimized\nin terms of the energy of incoming particles and the elementary size of the\ncalorimeter blocks. A new fit algorithm method is proposed that improves\nspatial resolution at high energies, and provides guidance for the design\noptimization of electromagnetic calorimeters.\n", "  If two particles collide inside the ergosphere, the energy in the centre of\nmass frame can be made unbound provided at least one of particles has a large\nnegative angular momentum (A. A. Grib and Yu. V. Pavlov, Europhys. Lett. 101,\n20004 (2013)). We show that the same condition can give rise to unbounded\nKilling energy of debris at infinity, i.e. super-Penrose process. Proximity of\nthe point of collision to the black hole horizon is not required.\n", "  The identification of new solid-state defect qubit candidates in widely used\nsemiconductors has the potential to enable the use of nanofabricated devices\nfor enhanced qubit measurement and control operations. In particular, the\nrecent discovery of optically active spin states in silicon carbide thin films\noffers a scalable route for incorporating defect qubits into on-chip photonic\ndevices. Here we demonstrate the use of 3C silicon carbide photonic crystal\ncavities for enhanced excitation of color center defect spin ensembles in order\nto increase measured photoluminescence signal count rates, optically detected\nmagnetic resonance signal intensities, and optical spin initialization rates.\nWe observe up to a factor of 30 increase in the photoluminescence and ODMR\nsignals from Ky5 color centers excited by cavity resonant excitation and\nincrease the rate of ground-state spin initialization by approximately a factor\nof two. Furthermore, we show that the small excitation mode volume and enhanced\nexcitation and collection efficiencies provided by the structures can be used\nto study inhomogeneous broadening in defect qubit ensembles. These results\nhighlight some of the benefits that nanofabricated devices offer for\nengineering the local photonic environment of color center defect qubits to\nenable applications in quantum information and sensing.\n", "  In the heavily hole-doped iron-based superconductors $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($A=$ K,\nRb, and Cs), the electron effective mass increases rapidly with alkali-ion\nradius. To study how the mass enhancement affects the superconducting state, we\nmeasure the London penetration depth $\\lambda(T)$ in clean crystals of\n$A$Fe$_2$As$_2$ down to low temperature $T\\sim0.1$ K. In all systems, the\nsuperfluid stiffness $\\rho_s(T)=\\lambda^2(0)/\\lambda^2(T)$ can be approximated\nby a power-law $T$ dependence at low temperatures, indicating the robustness of\nstrong momentum anisotropy in the superconducting gap $\\Delta(k)$. The power\n$\\alpha$ increases from $\\sim1$ with mass enhancement and approaches an\nunconventional exponent $\\alpha\\sim 1.5$ in the heaviest CsFe$_2$As$_2$. This\nappears to be a hallmark of superconductors near antiferromagnetic quantum\ncritical points, where the quasiparticles excited across the anisotropic\n$\\Delta(k)$ are significantly influenced by the momentum dependence of quantum\ncritical fluctuations.\n", "  We present a renormalization group study of the scalar potential in a minimal\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model involving one extra heavier Higgs\nand three heavy right-handed neutrinos with family universal B-L charge\nassignments. We implement a type-I seesaw for the masses of the light neutrinos\nof the Standard Model. In particular, compared to a previous study, we perform\na two-loop extension of the evolution, showing that two-loop effects are\nessential for the study of the stability of the scalar potential up to the\nPlanck scale. The analysis includes the contribution of the kinetic mixing\nbetween the two abelian gauge groups, which is radiatively generated by the\nevolution, and the one-loop matching conditions at the electroweak scale. By\nrequiring the stability of the potential up to the Planck mass, significant\nconstraints on the masses of the heavy neutrinos, on the gauge couplings and\nthe mixing in the Higgs sector are identified.\n", "  A new muon and pion capture system is proposed for the China Spallation\nNeutron Source (CSNS), currently under construction. Using about 4\\% of the\npulsed proton beam (1.6 GeV, 4 kW and 1 Hz) of CSNS to bombard a cylindrical\ngraphite target inside a superconducting solenoid, both surface muons and pions\ncan be acquired. The acceptance of this novel capture system - a graphite\ntarget wrapped up by a superconducting solenoid - is larger than the normal\nmuon beam lines using quadrupoles at one side of the separated muon target. The\nmuon and pion production at different capture magnetic fields was calculated\nusing Geant4. The bending angle of the capture solenoid with respect to the\nproton beam was also optimized in simulation to achieve more muons and pions.\nBased on the layout of the muon experimental area reserved at the CSNS project,\na preliminary muon beam line was designed with multi-purpose muon spin rotation\nareas (surface, decay and low-energy muons). Finally, high-flux surface muons\n(10$^8$/s) and decay muons (10$^9$/s) simulated by G4beamline will be available\nat the end of the decay solenoid based on the first phase of CSNS. This\ncollection and transport system will be a very effective beam line at a proton\ncurrent of 2.5 $\\mu$A.\n", "  Using the Matsubara Green function formalism we calculate the temperature\ndependence of spin Hall and spin Nernst conductivities of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction in the linear response regime.\nIn the case of spin Nernst effect we also include the contribution from\nspin-resolved orbital magnetization, which assures correct behavior of the spin\nNernst conductivity in the zero-temperature limit. Analytical formulas for the\nspin Hall and spin Nernst conductivities are derived in some specific\nsituations. Using the Ioffe-Regel localization criterion, we have also\nestimated the range of parameters where the calculated results for the spin\nHall and spin Nernst conductivities are applicable. Analytical results show\nthat the vertex correction totally suppresses the spin Hall conductivity at\narbitrary temperature. The spin Nernst conductivity, in turn, vanishes at $T=0$\nwhen the orbital contribution is taken into account, but generally is nonzero\nat finite temperatures.\n", "  We study wavefunctions on D$7$-branes with magnetic fluxes in the conifold.\nSince some supersymmetric embeddings of D-branes on the $AdS_5\\times T^{1,1}$\ngeometry are known, we consider one of the embeddings, especially the spacetime\nfilling D$7$-branes in which (a part of) the standard model is expected to be\nrealized. The explicit form of induced metric on the D$7$-branes allows us to\nsolve the Laplace and Dirac equations to evaluate matter wavefunctions in extra\ndimensions analytically. We find that the zero-mode wavefunctions can be\nlocalized depending on the configuration of magnetic fluxes on D$7$-branes, and\nshow some phenomenological aspects.\n", "  Due to high reflectivity and high resolution of X-ray pulses, diamond is one\nof the most popular Bragg crystals serving as the reflecting mirror and\nmono$-$chromator in the next generation of free electrons lasers (FELs). The\nenergy deposition of X-rays will result in thermal heating, and thus lattice\nexpansion of the diamond crystal, which may degrade the performance of X-ray\nFELs. In this paper, the thermal loading effect of diamond crystal for X-ray\nFEL oscillators has been systematically studied by combined simulation with\nGeant4 and ANSYS, and its dependence on the environmental temperature, crystal\nsize, X-ray pulse repetition rate and pulse energy are presented. Our results\nshow that taking the thermal loading effects into account, X-ray FEL\noscillators are still robust and promising with an optimized design.\n", "  Dramatically improved data from observatories like the CoRoT and Kepler\nspacecraft have recently facilitated nonlinear time series analysis and\nphenomenological modeling of variable stars, including the search for strange\n(aka fractal) or chaotic dynamics. We recently argued [Lindner et al., Phys.\nRev. Lett. 114 (2015) 054101] that the Kepler data includes \"golden\" stars,\nwhose luminosities vary quasiperiodically with two frequencies nearly in the\ngolden ratio, and whose secondary frequencies exhibit power-law scaling with\nexponent near -1.5, suggesting strange nonchaotic dynamics and singular\nspectra. Here we use a series of phenomenological models to make plausible the\nconnection between golden stars and fractal spectra. We thereby suggest that at\nleast some features of variable star dynamics reflect universal nonlinear\nphenomena common to even simple systems.\n", "  In this paper we study the stability of fronts in a reduction of a well-known\nPDE system that is used to model the combustion in hydraulically resistant\nporous media. More precisely, we consider the original PDE system under the\nassumption that one of the parameters of the model, the Lewis number, is chosen\nin a specific way and with initial conditions of a specific form. {For a class\nof initial conditions, then the number of unknown functions is reduced from\nthree to two. For the reduced system, the existence of combustion fronts\nfollows from the existence results for the original system. The stability of\nthese fronts is studied here by a combination of energy estimates and numerical\nEvans function computations and nonlinear analysis when applicable. We then\nlift the restriction on the initial conditions and show that the stability\nresults obtained for the reduced system extend to the fronts in the full system\nconsidered for that specific value of the Lewis number. The fronts that we\n{investigate} are proved to be either absolutely unstable or convectively\nunstable on the nonlinear level.\n", "  Measurement is one of the most counter-intuitive aspects of quantum physics.\nFrequent measurements of a quantum system lead to quantum Zeno dynamics where\ntime evolution becomes confined to a subspace defined by the projections.\nHowever, weak measurement performed at a finite rate is also capable of locking\nthe system into such a Zeno subspace in an unconventional way: by Raman-like\ntransitions via virtual intermediate states outside this subspace, which are\nnot forbidden. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of non-Hermitian\ndynamics by showing that the stochastic competition between measurement and a\nsystem's own dynamics can be described by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We\nobtain an analytic solution for ultracold bosons in a lattice and show that a\ndark state of the tunnelling operator is a steady state in which the\nobservable's fluctuations are zero and tunnelling is suppressed by destructive\nmatter-wave interference. This opens a new venue of investigation beyond the\ncanonical quantum Zeno dynamics and leads to a new paradigm of competition\nbetween global measurement backaction and short-range atomic dynamics.\n", "  While the existence of a spin-liquid ground state of the spin-1/2 kagome\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet (KHAF) is well established, the discussion of the\neffect of an interlayer coupling (ILC) by controlled theoretical approaches is\nstill lacking. Here we study this problem by using the coupled-cluster method\nto high orders of approximation. We consider a stacked KHAF with a\nperpendicular ILC $J_\\perp$, where we study ferro- as well as antiferromagnetic\n$J_\\perp$. We find that the spin-liquid ground state (GS) persists until\nrelatively large strengths of the ILC. Only if the strength of the ILC exceeds\nabout 15\\% of the intralayer coupling the spin-liquid phase gives way for $q=0$\nmagnetic long-range order, where the transition between both phases is\ncontinuous and the critical strength of the ILC, $|J^c_\\perp|$, is almost\nindependent of the sign of $J_\\perp$. Thus, by contrast to the quantum GS\nselection of the strictly two-dimensional KHAF at large spin $s$, the ILC leads\nfirst to a selection of the $q=0$ GS. Only at larger $|J_\\perp|$ the ILC drives\na first-order transition to the $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$ long-range ordered GS.\nAs a result, the stacked spin-1/2 KHAF exhibits a rich GS phase diagram with\ntwo continuous and two discontinuous transitions driven by the ILC.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-decay energies ($Q_\\alpha$) are systematically investigated with\nthe nuclear masses for $10 \\leq Z \\leq 120$ isotopes obtained by the\nrelativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory with the covariant\ndensity functional PC-PK1, and compared with available experimental values. It\nis found that the $\\alpha$-decay energies deduced from the RCHB results present\nsimilar pattern as those from available experiments. Owing to the large\npredicted $Q_\\alpha$ values ($\\geq$ 4 MeV), many undiscovered heavy nuclei in\nthe proton-rich side and super-heavy nuclei may have large possibilities for\n$\\alpha$-decay. The influence of nuclear shell structure on $\\alpha$-decay\nenergies is also analysed.\n", "  Transverse magneto-thermoelectric effects are studied in permalloy thin films\ngrown on MgO substrates. We find that small parasitic magnetic fields below 1\nOe can produce artifacts of the order of 1 % of the amplitude of the\nanisotropic magneto-thermopower which is also detected in the experiments. The\nmeasured artifacts reveal a new source of uncertainties for the detection of\nthe transverse spin Seebeck effect. Taking these results into account we\nconclude that the contribution of the transverse spin Seebeck effect to the\ndetected voltages is below the noise level of 20 nV.\n", "  The collective motion of groups of animals emerges from the net effect of the\ninteractions between individual members of the group. In many cases, such as\nbirds, fish, or ungulates, these interactions are mediated by sensory stimuli\nthat predominantly arise from nearby neighbors. But not all stimuli in animal\ngroups are short range. Here, we consider mating swarms of midges, which\ninteract primarily via long-range acoustic stimuli. We exploit the similarity\nin form between the decay of acoustic and gravitational sources to build a\nmodel for swarm behavior. By accounting for the adaptive nature of the midges'\nacoustic sensing, we show that our \"adaptive gravity\" model makes mean-field\npredictions that agree well with experimental observations of laboratory\nswarms. Our results highlight the role of sensory mechanisms and interaction\nrange in collective animal behavior. The adaptive interactions that we present\nhere open a new class of equations of motion, which may appear in other\nbiological contexts.\n", "  In this work we study the interaction of the coupled channels $\\Omega \\eta$\nand $\\Xi^* \\bar{K}$ within the chiral unitary approach. The systems under\nconsideration have total isospins $0$, strangeness $S = -3$, and spin $3/2$. We\nstudied the $s$ wave interaction which implies that the possible resonances\ngenerated in the system can have spin-parity $J^P = 3/2^-$. The unitary\namplitudes in coupled channels develop poles that can be associated with some\nknown baryonic resonances. We find there is a dynamically generated $3/2^-$\n$\\Omega$ state with mass around $1800$ MeV, which is in agreement with the\npredictions of the five-quark model.\n", "  We develop a diagrammatic method for the evaluation of general multi-band\nGutzwiller wave functions in finite dimensions. Our approach provides a\nsystematic improvement of the widely used Gutzwiller approximation. As a first\napplication we investigate itinerant ferromagnetism and correlation-induced\ndeformations of the Fermi surface for a two-band Hubbard model on a square\nlattice.\n", "  The beam energy measurement system is of great importance and profit for both\nBEPC-II accelerator and BES-III detector. The system is based on measuring the\nenergies of Compton back-scattered photons. Many advanced techniques and\nprecise instruments are employed to realize the highly accurate measurement of\npositron/electron beam energy. During five year's running period, in order to\nmeet the requirement of data taking and improve the capacity of measurement\nitself, the upgradation of system is continued, which involve the component\nreformation of laser and optics subsystem, replacement of view-port of the\nlaser to vacuum insertion subsystem, the purchase of electric cooling system\nfor high purity germanium detector, and the improvement of data acquisition and\nprocessing subsystem. The upgrading of system guarantees the smooth and\nefficient measuring of beam energy at BEPC-II and accommodates the accurate\noffline energy values for further physics analysis at BES-III.\n", "  We analyze a large number of high-order discrete velocity models for solving\nthe Boltzmann-BGK equation for finite Knudsen number flows. Using the\nChapman-Enskog formalism, we prove for isothermal flows a relation identifying\nthe resolved flow regimes for low Mach numbers. Although high-order lattice\nBoltzmann models recover flow regimes beyond the Navier-Stokes level we observe\nfor several models significant deviations from reference results. We found this\nto be caused by their inability to recover the Maxwell boundary condition\nexactly. By using supplementary conditions for the gas-surface interaction it\nis shown how to systematically generate discrete velocity models of any order\nwith the inherent ability to fulfill the diffuse Maxwell boundary condition\naccurately. Both high-order quadratures and an exact representation of the\nboundary condition turn out to be crucial for achieving reliable results. For\nPoiseuille flow, we can reproduce the mass flow and slip velocity up to the\nKnudsen number of 1. Moreover, for small Knudsen numbers, the Knudsen layer\nbehavior is recovered.\n", "  The step-by-step chromaticity compensation method for chromatic sextupole\noptimization and dynamic aperture increase was proposed by E. Levichev and P.\nPiminov (E. Levichev and P. Piminov, 2006 [1]). Although this method can be\nused to enlarge the dynamic aperture of storage ring, it has some drawbacks. In\nthis paper, we combined this method with evolutionary computation algorithms,\nand proposed an improved version of this method. In the improved method, the\ndrawbacks are avoided, and thus better optimization results can be obtained.\n", "  A collective, macroscopic signature to detect radiation friction in\nlaser-plasma experiments is proposed. In the interaction of superintense\ncircularly polarized laser pulses with high density targets, the effective\ndissipation due to radiative losses allows the absorption of electromagnetic\nangular momentum, which in turn leads to the generation of a quasistatic axial\nmagnetic field. This peculiar \"inverse Faraday effect\" is investigated by\nanalytical modeling and three-dimensional simulations, showing that\nmulti-gigagauss magnetic fields may be generated at laser intensities\n$>10^{23}~\\mbox{W cm}^{-2}$.\n", "  Some integrals of matrix spaces over a quaternionic field have been\ncalculated in this work. The associated volume of hyperbolic matrix spaces over\na quaternionic field has also been calculated by making use of these integrals,\nand it is of great significance in calculating related kernel functions of\nthese spaces.\n", "  In ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of real-world problems, the\nsimple Verlet method is still widely used for integrating the equations of\nmotion, while more efficient algorithms are routinely used in classical\nmolecular dynamics. We show that if the Verlet method is used in conjunction\nwith pre- and postprocessing, the accuracy of the time integration is\nsignificantly improved with only a small computational overhead. The validity\nof the processed Verlet method is demonstrated in several examples including ab\ninitio molecular dynamics simulations of liquid water. The structural\nproperties obtained from the processed Verlet method are found to be\nsufficiently accurate even for large time steps close to the stability limit.\nThis approach results in a 2x performance gain over the standard Verlet method\nfor a given accuracy.\n", "  In this present paper we study the entanglement dynamics in qubit A-qutrit B\npair under x component of Dzyaloshinshkii-Moriya $(D_{x})$ by taking an\nauxiliary qubit C. Here we consider an entangled qubit-qutrit pair initially\nprepared in two parameter qubit-qutrit states and one auxiliary qubit prepared\nin pure state interacts with the qutrit of the pair through DM interaction. We\ntrace away the auxiliary qubit and calculate the reduced dynamics in qubit\nA-qutrit B pair to study the influence of the state of auxiliary qubit C and\n$D_{x}$ on entanglement. We find that the state (probability amplitude) of\nauxiliary qubit does not influence the entanglement, only $D_{x}$ influences\nthe same. The phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) induced by $D_{x}$\nhas also been observed. We also present the affected and unaffected two\nparameter qubit-qutrit states by $D_{x}$.\n", "  Binary neutron stars are among the most promising candidates for joint\ngravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy. The goal of this work is to\ninvestigate the strategy of using gravitational wave sky-localizations for\nbinary neutron star systems, to search for electromagnetic counterparts using\nwide field of view optical telescopes. We examine various strategies of\nscanning the gravitational wave sky-localizations on the mock 2015-16\ngravitational-wave events. We propose an optimal tiling-strategy that would\nensure the most economical coverage of the gravitational wave sky-localization,\nwhile keeping in mind the realistic constrains of transient optical astronomy.\nOur analysis reveals that the proposed tiling strategy improves the\nsky-localization coverage over naive contour-covering method. The improvement\nis more significant for observations conducted using larger field of view\ntelescopes, or for observations conducted over smaller confidence interval of\ngravitational wave sky-localization probability distribution. Next, we\ninvestigate the performance of the tiling strategy for telescope arrays and\ncompare their performance against monolithic giant field of view telescopes. We\nobserved that distributing the field of view of the telescopes into arrays of\nmultiple telescopes significantly improves the coverage efficiency by as much\nas 50% over a single large FOV telescope in 2016 localizations while scanning\naround 100 sq. degrees. Finally, we studied the ability of optical counterpart\ndetection by various types of telescopes. In Our analysis for a range of wide\nfield-of-view telescopes we found improvement in detection upon sacrificing\ncoverage of localization in order to achieve greater observation depth for very\nlarge field-of-view - small aperture telescopes, especially if the intrinsic\nbrightness of the optical counterparts are weak.\n", "  We present a two-field inflation model where inflaton field has a\nnon-canonical kinetic term due to the presence of a dilaton field. It is a\ntwo-parameter generalization of one-parameter Brans-Dicke gravity in the\nEinstein frame. We show that in such an inflation model the quartic and\nquadratic inflaton potentials, which are otherwise ruled out by the present\nPlanck-{\\it Keck}/BICEP2 data, yield scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar\nratio in accordance with the present data. Such a model yield tensor-to-scalar\nratio of the order of $10^{-2}$ which is within the reach of $B-$mode\nexperiments like {\\it Keck}/BICEP3, CMBPol and thus can be put to test in the\nnear future. This model yields negligible non-Gaussianity and no isocurvature\nperturbations upto slow-roll approximation. Finally, we show that such a model\ncan be realised in the realm of no-scale supergravity.\n", "  Planar spin transport in disordered ultrathin magnetic bilayers comprising a\nferromagnet and a normal metal (typically used for spin pumping, spin Seebeck\nand spin-orbit torque experiments) is investigated theoretically. Using a\ntight-binding model that treats extrinsic spin Hall effect, spin swapping and\nspin relaxation on equal footing, we show that the nature of spin-orbit coupled\ntransport dramatically depends on ratio between the layers thickness $d$ and\nthe mean free path $\\lambda$. While spin Hall effect dominates in the diffusive\nlimit ($d\\gg\\lambda$), spin swapping dominates in Knudsen regime\n($d\\lesssim\\lambda$). A remarkable consequence is that the symmetry of the\nspin-orbit torque exerted on the ferromagnet is entirely different in these two\nregimes.\n", "  The spot size of the x-ray source is a key parameter of a flash-radiography\nfacility, which is usually quoted as an evaluation of the resolving power. The\npinhole imaging technique is applied to measure the spot size of the Dragon-I\nlinear induction accelerator, by which a two-dimensional spatial distribution\nof the source spot is obtained. Experimental measurements are performed to\nmeasure the spot image when the transportation and focusing of the electron\nbeam is tuned by adjusting the currents of solenoids in the downstream section.\nThe spot size of full-width at half maximum and that defined from the spatial\nfrequency at half peak value of the modulation transfer function are calculated\nand discussed.\n", "  An important ingredient for applications of nuclear physics to e.g.\nastrophysics or nuclear energy are the cross sections for reactions of neutrons\nwith rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are often not possible, indirect\nmethods like $(d,p)$ reactions must be used instead. Those $(d,p)$ reactions\nmay be viewed as effective three-body reactions and described with Faddeev\ntechniques. An additional challenge posed by $(d,p)$ reactions involving\nheavier nuclei is the treatment of the Coulomb force. To avoid numerical\ncomplications in dealing with the screening of the Coulomb force, recently a\nnew approach using the Coulomb distorted basis in momentum space was suggested.\nIn order to implement this suggestion, one needs to derive a separable\nrepresentation of neutron- and proton-nucleus optical potentials and compute\ntheir matrix elements in this basis.\n", "  LCODE is a freely-distributed quasistatic 2D3V code for simulating plasma\nwakefield acceleration, mainly specialized at resource-efficient studies of\nlong-term propagation of ultrarelativistic particle beams in plasmas. The beam\nis modeled with fully relativistic macro-particles in a simulation window\ncopropagating with the light velocity; the plasma can be simulated with either\nkinetic or fluid model. Several techniques are used to obtain exceptional\nnumerical stability and precision while maintaining high resource efficiency,\nenabling LCODE to simulate the evolution of long particle beams over long\npropagation distances even on a laptop. A recent upgrade enabled LCODE to\nperform the calculations in parallel. A pipeline of several LCODE processes\ncommunicating via MPI (Message-Passing Interface) is capable of executing\nmultiple consecutive time steps of the simulation in a single pass. This\napproach can speed up the calculations by hundreds of times.\n", "  Presently available high-energy proton beams in circular accelerators carry\nenough momentum to accelerate high-intensity electron and positron beams to the\nTeV energy scale over several hundred meters of the plasma with a density of\nabout 1e15 1/cm^3. However, the plasma wavelength at this density is 100-1000\ntimes shorter than the typical longitudinal size of the high-energy proton\nbeam. Therefore the self-modulation instability (SMI) of a long (~10 cm) proton\nbeam in the plasma should be used to create the train of micro-bunches which\nwould then drive the plasma wake resonantly. Changing the plasma density\nprofile offers a simple way to control the development of the SMI and the\nacceleration of particles during this process. We present simulations of the\npossible use of a plasma density gradient as a way to control the acceleration\nof the electron beam during the development of the SMI of a 400 GeV proton beam\nin a 10 m long plasma. This work is done in the context of the AWAKE project\n--- the proof-of-principle experiment on proton driven plasma wakefield\nacceleration at CERN.\n", "  Magnetic field induced drastically augmented thermal conductivity of magneto\nnanocolloids involving magnetic oxide nanoparticles, viz. Fe2O3, Fe3O4, Nickel\noxide (NiO), Cobalt oxide (Co3O4), dispersed in different base fluids (heat\ntransfer oil, kerosene, and ethylene glycol) have been reported. Experiments\nreveal the augmented thermal transport under the external applied magnetic\nfield, with kerosene based MNCs showing at relatively low magnetic field\nintensities as compared to the heat transfer oil and EG based MNCs. A maximum\nthermal conductivity enhancement of 114 % is attained at 7.0 vol. %\nconcentration and 0.1 T field intensity for Fe3O4/EG magneto nanocolloid.\nHowever, a maximum of 82% thermal conductivity enhancement is observed for\nFe3O4/Kerosene magneto nanocolloid for the same concentration but relatively at\nlow magnetic field (600 G). Thereby, a strong effect of fluid as well as\nparticle physical properties on the chain formation propensity, leading to\nenhanced conduction, in such systems is observed. Co3O4 nanoparticles show\ninsignificant effect on the thermal conductivity enhancement of MNCs due to\ntheir minimal magnetic moment. An analytical approach has been proposed to\nunderstand the mechanism and physics behind the thermal conductivity\nenhancement under external applied magnetic field, in tune with near field\nmagnetostatic interactions as well as Neel relaxivity of the magnetic\nnanoparticles. Furthermore, the analytical model is able to predict the\nphenomenon of enhanced thermal conductivity as a function of physical\nparameters such as chain length, size and types of nanoparticles, fluid\ncharacteristics, magnetic field intensity, saturation magnetic moment,\nnanoparticle concentration etc. and good agreement with the experimental\nresults has been observed.\n", "  Model-independent search for the Abelian Z' gauge boson in the Drell-Yan\nprocess at the LHC at s^{1/2}= 7 TeV and 8 TeV is fulfilled. Estimations of the\nZ' axial-vector coupling a_f^2 to the standard model fermions, the couplings of\nthe axial-vector to lepton vector currents a_f v_l and the couplings of the\naxial-vector to quark vector currents a_f v_q are derived within data on the\nforward-backward asymmetry presented by the CMS Collaboration. The analysis\ntakes into consideration the behaviour of the differential cross-section which\nexhibits itself if the derived already special relations between the couplings\nproper to the renormalizable theories are accounted for. In particular, they\nhold in all the models of Abelian Z' usually considered in the model-dependent\nanalysis of the LHC data. The coupling values are estimated at ~ 92 % CL by\nmeans of the maximum likelihood function. They weakly depend on the Z' mass in\nthe investigated interval 1.2 TeV < m_Z' < 5 TeV. Taking into account the\ndependence of Z-Z' mixing angle theta_0 on m_Z' and the LEP constraints\n|theta_0|~ 10^{-3}-10^{-4}, the optimistic limits on m_{Z'} are established as\n3 < m_Z' < 7-8 TeV. Comparison with the results of other authors is given.\n", "  In this paper we present a search algorithm that finds useful optical quantum\nstates which can be created with current technology. We apply the algorithm to\nthe field of quantum metrology with the goal of finding states that can measure\na phase shift to a high precision. Our algorithm efficiently produces a number\nof novel solutions: we find experimentally-ready schemes to produce states that\nshow significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, and can measure with a\nprecision that beats the shot noise limit by over a factor of 4. Furthermore,\nthese states demonstrate a robustness to moderate/high photon losses, and we\npresent a conceptually simple measurement scheme that saturates the\nCram\\'er-Rao bound.\n", "  The linear Boltzmann equation can be solved with separation of variables in\none dimension, i.e., in three-dimensional space with planar symmetry. In this\nmethod, solutions are given by superpositions of eigenmodes which are sometimes\ncalled singular eigenfunctions. In this paper, we explore the\nsingular-eigenfunction approach in flatland or two-dimensional space.\n", "  The study of exotic nuclear structures, such as halo nuclei, is usually\nperformed through nuclear reactions. An accurate reaction model coupled to a\nrealistic description of the projectile is needed to correctly interpret\nexperimental data. In this contribution, we briefly summarise the assumptions\nmade within the modelling of reactions involving halo nuclei. We describe\nbriefly the Continuum-Discretised Coupled Channel method (CDCC) and the\nDynamical Eikonal Approximation (DEA) in particular and present a comparison\nbetween them for the breakup of 15C on Pb at 68AMeV. We show the problem faced\nby the models based on the eikonal approximation at low energy and detail a\ncorrection that enables their extension down to lower beam energies. A new\nreaction observable is also presented. It consists of the ratio between angular\ndistributions for two different processes, such as elastic scattering and\nbreakup. This ratio is completely independent of the reaction mechanism and\nhence is more sensitive to the projectile structure than usual reaction\nobservables, which makes it a very powerful tool to study exotic structures far\nfrom stability.\n", "  We compare results from a spectral model for non-stationary, inhomogeneous\nturbulence (Besnard et al., Theor. Comp. Fluid. Dyn., vol. 8, pp 1-35, 1996)\nwith Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data of a shear-free mixing layer (SFML)\n(Tordella et al., Phys. Rev. E, vol. 77, 016309, 2008). The SFML is used as a\ntest case in which the efficacy of the model closure for the physical-space\ntransport of the fluid velocity field can be tested in a flow with\ninhomogeneity, without the additional complexity of mean-flow coupling. The\nmodel is able to capture certain features of the SFML quite well for\nintermediate to long-times, including the evolution of the mixing-layer width\nand turbulent kinetic energy. At short-times, and for more sensitive statistics\nsuch as the generation of the velocity field anisotropy, the model is less\naccurate. We present arguments, supported by the DNS data, that a significant\ncause of the discrepancies is the local approximation to the intrinsically\nnon-local pressure-transport in physical-space that was made in the model, the\neffects of which would be particularly strong at short-times when the\ninhomogeneity of the SFML is strongest.\n", "  `Additional' ionization of light atoms and ions during nuclear $\\beta^{-}$\ndecay is investigated. The procedure which can be used to determine the\ncorresponding transition probabilities and the velocity/energy spectrum of\nsecondary electrons is developed. Emission of very fast secondary electrons\n($\\delta-$electrons) from $\\beta^{-}$-decaying atoms is also briefly discussed.\n", "  AWAKE, the Advanced Proton-Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment,\nis a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN using a 400 GeV/c proton beam\nfrom the CERN SPS (longitudinal beam size sigma_z = 12 cm) which will be sent\ninto a 10 m long plasma section with a nominal density of approx. 7x10^14\natoms/cm3 (plasma wavelength lambda_p = 1.2mm). In this paper we show that by\nmeasuring the time integrated transverse profile of the proton bunch at two\nlocations downstream of the AWAKE plasma, information about the occurrence of\nthe self-modulation instability (SMI) can be inferred. In particular we show\nthat measuring defocused protons with an angle of 1 mrad corresponds to having\nelectric fields in the order of GV/m and fully developed self-modulation of the\nproton bunch. Additionally, by measuring the defocused beam edge of the\nself-modulated bunch, information about the growth rate of the instability can\nbe extracted. If hosing instability occurs, it could be detected by measuring a\nnon-uniform defocused beam shape with changing radius. Using a 1 mm thick\nChromox scintillation screen for imaging of the self-modulated proton bunch, an\nedge resolution of 0.6 mm and hence a SMI saturation point resolution of 1.2 m\ncan be achieved.\n", "  Absolute binding energies of core electrons in molecules and bulk materials\ncan be efficiently calculated by spin paired density-function theory employing\na $\\Delta$ Kohn-Sham ($\\Delta$KS) scheme corrected by offsets that are highly\ntransferable. These offsets depend on core level and atomic species and can be\ndetermined by comparing $\\Delta$KS energies to experimental molecular X-ray\nphotoelectron spectra. We demonstrate the correct prediction of absolute and\nrelative binding energies on a wide range of molecules, metals and insulators.\n", "  Recent work has unveiled a new class of optical systems that can exhibit the\ncharacteristic features of superfluidity. One such system relies on the\nrepulsive photon-photon interaction that is mediated by a thermal optical\nnonlinearity and is therefore inherently nonlocal due to thermal diffusion.\nHere we investigate how such a nonlocal interaction, which at a first\ninspection would not be expected to lead to superfluid behavior, may be\ntailored by acting upon the geometry of the photon fluid itself. Our models and\nmeasurements show that restricting the laser profile and hence the photon fluid\nto a strongly elliptical geometry modifies thermal diffusion along the major\nbeam axis and reduces the effective nonlocal interaction length by two orders\nof magnitude. This in turn enables the system to display a characteristic trait\nof superfluid flow: the nucleation of quantized vortices in the flow past an\nextended physical obstacle. These results are general and apply to other\nnonlocal fluids, such as dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates, and show that\n\"thermal\" photon superfluids provide an exciting and novel experimental\nenvironment for probing the nature of superfluidity, with applications to the\nstudy of quantum turbulence and analogue gravity.\n", "  We calculate the threshold singularities in one-dimensional models using the\nuniversal low-energy formfactors obtained in the framework of the non-linear\nLuttinger liquid model. We find the reason why the simplified picture of the\nimpurity moving in the Luttinger liquid leads to the correct results. We obtain\nthe prefactors of the singularities including their $k$- dependence at small\n$k<<p_F$.\n", "  Self modulated dynamics of a relativistic charged particle beam is reviewed\nwithin the context of the theory of plasma wake field excitation. The\nself-consistent description of the beam dynamics is provided by coupling the\nVlasov equation with a Poisson-type equation relating the plasma wake potential\nto the beam density. An analysis of the beam envelope self-modulation is then\ncarried out and the criteria for the occurrence of the instability are\ndiscussed thereby.\n", "  Exploration of spin-currents in organic semiconductors (OSECs) induced by\nresonant microwave absorption in ferromagnetic substrates has been of great\ninterest for potential spintronics applications. Due to the inherently weak\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) of OSECs, their inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE)\nresponse is very subtle; limited by the microwave power applicable under\ncontinuous-wave (cw) excitation. Here we introduce a novel approach for\ngenerating significant ISHE signals using pulsed ferromagnetic resonance, where\nthe ISHE is ~2-3 orders of magnitude larger compared to cw excitation. This\nstrong ISHE enables us to investigate a variety of OSECs ranging from\npi-conjugated polymers with strong SOC that contain intrachain platinum atoms,\nto weak SOC polymers, to C60 films, where the SOC is predominantly caused by\nthe molecule surface curvature. The pulsed-ISHE technique offers a robust route\nfor efficient injection and detection schemes of spin-currents at room\ntemperature, and paves the way for spin-orbitronics in plastic materials.\n", "  An improved method for characterizing the magnetic anisotropy of films with\ncubic symmetry is described and is applied to an yttrium iron garnet (111)\nfilm. Analysis of the FMR spectra performed both in-plane and out-of-plane from\n0.7 to 8 GHz yielded the magnetic anisotropy constants as well as the\nsaturation magnetization. The field at which FMR is observed turns out to be\nquite sensitive to anisotropy constants (by more than a factor ten) in the low\nfrequency (< 2 GHz) regime and when the orientation of the magnetic field is\nnearly normal to the sample plane; the restoring force on the magnetization\narising from the magnetocrystalline anisotropy fields is then comparable to\nthat from the external field, thereby allowing the anisotropy constants to be\ndetermined with greater accuracy. In this region, unusual dynamical behaviors\nare observed such as multiple resonances and a switching of FMR resonance with\nonly a 1 degree change in field orientation at 0.7 GHz.\n", "  We investigate the electronic instabilities in a Kagome lattice with Rashba\nspin-orbital coupling by the unbiased singular-mode functional renormalization\ngroup. At the parent $1/3$-filling, the normal state is a quantum spin Hall\nsystem. Since the bottom of the conduction band is near the van Hove\nsingularity, the electron-doped system is highly susceptible to competing\norders upon electron interactions. The topological nature of the parent system\nenriches the complexity and novelty of such orders. We find $120^o$-type\nintra-unitcell antiferromagnetic order, $f$-wave superconductivity and chiral\n$p$-wave superconductivity with increasing electron doping above the van Hove\npoint. In both types of superconducting phases, there is a mixture of\ncomparable spin singlet and triplet components because of the Rashba coupling.\nThe chiral $p$-wave superconducting state is characterized by a Chern number\n$Z=1$, supporting a branch of Weyl fermion states on each edge. The model bares\nclose relevance to the so-called $sd^2$-graphenes proposed recently.\n", "  A numerical investigation on the spatiotemporal evolution of an electron\nbeam, externally injected in a plasma in the presence of a plasma wake field,\nis carried out. The latter is driven by an ultra-short relativistic\naxially-symmetric femtosecond electron bunch. We first derive a novel\nPoisson-like equation for the wake potential where the driving term is the\nultra-short bunch density, taking suitably into account the interplay between\nthe sharpness and high energy of the bunch. Then, we show that a channel is\nformed longitudinally, through the externally injected beam while experiencing\nthe effects of the bunch-driven plasma wake field, within the context of\nthermal wave model. The formation of the channel seems to be a final stage of\nthe 3D evolution of the beam. This involves the appearance of small filaments\nand bubbles around the longitudinal axis. The bubbles coalesce forming a\nrelatively stable axially-symmetric hollow beam structure.\n", "  We study the Z_N symmetry in SU(N)+Higgs theories with the Higgs field in the\nfundamental representation. The distributions of the Polyakov loop show that\nthe Z_N symmetry is explicitly broken in the Higgs phase. On the other hand,\ninside the Higgs symmetric phase the Polyakov loop distributions and other\nphysical observables exhibit the Z_N symmetry. This effective restoration of\nthe Z_N symmetry changes the nature of the confinement-deconfinenement\ntransition. We argue that the Z_N symmetry will lead to time independent\ntopological defect solutions in the Higgs symmetric deconfined phase which will\nplay important role at high temperatures.\n", "  The limits of previous methods promote us to design a new approach (named\nPRESTAGE) to predict proton single event effect (SEE) cross-sections using\nheavy-ion test data. To more realistically simulate the SEE mechanisms, we\nadopt Geant4 and the location-dependent strategy to describe the physics\nprocesses and the sensitivity of the device. Cross-sections predicted by\nPRESTAGE for over twenty devices are compared with the measured data. Evidences\nshow that PRESTAGE can calculate not only single event upsets induced by proton\nindirect ionization, but also direct ionization effects and single event\nlatch-ups. Most of the PRESTAGE calculated results agree with the experimental\ndata within a factor of 2-3.\n", "  A method to accurately measure the density of Rb vapor is described. We plan\non using this method for the Advanced Wakefield (AWAKE)~\\cite{bib:awake}\nproject at CERN , which will be the world's first proton driven plasma\nwakefield experiment. The method is similar to the hook~\\cite{bib:Hook} method\nand has been described in great detail in the work by W. Tendell Hill et.\nal.~\\cite{bib:densitymeter}. In this method a cosine fit is applied to the\ninterferogram to obtain a relative accuracy on the order of $1\\%$ for the vapor\ndensity-length product. A single-mode, fiber-based, Mach-Zenhder interferometer\nwill be built and used near the ends of the 10 meter-long AWAKE plasma source\nto be able to make accurate relative density measurement between these two\nlocations. This can then be used to infer the vapor density gradient along the\nAWAKE plasma source and also change it to the value desired for the plasma\nwakefield experiment. Here we describe the plan in detail and show preliminary\nresults obtained using a prototype 8 cm long novel Rb vapor cell.\n", "  This report describes the conceptual steps in reaching the design of the\nAWAKE experiment currently under construction at CERN. We start with an\nintroduction to plasma wakefield acceleration and the motivation for using\nproton drivers. We then describe the self-modulation instability --- a key to\nan early realization of the concept. This is then followed by the historical\ndevelopment of the experimental design, where the critical issues that arose\nand their solutions are described. We conclude with the design of the\nexperiment as it is being realized at CERN and some words on the future\noutlook. A summary of the AWAKE design and construction status as presented in\nthis conference is given in [1].\n", "  We use next-to-leading-order in perturbation theory to investigate the\neffects of a finite isospin density on the thermodynamics of cold strongly\ninteracting matter. Our results include nonzero quark masses and are compared\nto lattice data.\n", "  We demonstrate how the image analysis technique of wavelet decomposition can\nbe applied to the gamma-ray sky to separate emission on different angular\nscales. New structures on scales that differ from the scales of the\nconventional astrophysical foreground and background uncertainties can be\nrobustly extracted, allowing a model-independent characterization with no\npresumption of exact signal morphology. As a test case, we generate mock\ngamma-ray data to demonstrate our ability to extract extended signals without\nassuming a fixed spatial template. For some point source luminosity functions,\nour technique also allows us to differentiate a diffuse signal in gamma-rays\nfrom dark matter annihilation and extended gamma-ray point source populations\nin a data-driven way.\n", "  We compare global predictions from the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation, and\ntwo semi-analytic (SA) models of galaxy formation, L-GALAXIES and GALFORM. All\nthree models include the key physical processes for the formation and evolution\nof galaxies and their parameters are calibrated against a small number of\nobservables at $z\\approx 0$. The two SA models have been applied to merger\ntrees constructed from the EAGLE dark matter only simulation. We find that at\n$z\\leq 2$, both the galaxy stellar mass functions for stellar masses\n$M_*<10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$ and the median specific star formation rates (sSFRs)\nin the three models agree to better than $0.4$~dex. The evolution of the sSFR\npredicted by the three models closely follows the mass assembly history of dark\nmatter haloes. In both EAGLE and L-GALAXIES there are more central passive\ngalaxies with $M_*<10^{9.5} M_{\\odot}$ than in L-GALAXIES. This difference is\nrelated to galaxies that have entered and then left a larger halo and which are\ntreated as satellites in GALFORM. In the range $0<z<1$, the slope of the\nevolution of the star formation rate density in EAGLE is a factor of $\\approx\n1.5$ steeper than for the two SA models. The median sizes for galaxies with\n$M_*>10^{9.5} M_{\\odot}$ differ in some instances by an order of magnitude,\nwhile the stellar mass-size relation in EAGLE is a factor of $\\approx 2$\ntighter than for the two SA models. Our results suggest the need for a revision\nof how SA models treat the effect of baryonic self-gravity on the underlying\ndark matter. The treatment of gas flows in the models needs to be revised based\non detailed comparison with observations to understand in particular the\nevolution of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.\n", "  We apply the Karhunen-Lo\\'eve methods to cosmic microwave background (CMB)\ndata sets, and show that we can recover the input cosmology and obtain the\nmarginalized likelihoods in $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmologies in under a\nminute, much faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by\nforming a linear combination of the power spectra at each multipole $l$, and\nsolving a system of simultaneous equations such that the Fisher matrix is\nlocally unchanged. Instead of carrying out a full likelihood evaluation over\nthe whole parameter space, we need evaluate the likelihood only for the\nparameter of interest, with the data compression effectively marginalizing over\nall other parameters. The weighting vectors contain insight about the physical\neffects of the parameters on the CMB anisotropy power spectrum $C_l$. The shape\nand amplitude of these vectors give an intuitive feel for the physics of the\nCMB, the sensitivity of the observed spectrum to cosmological parameters, and\nthe relative sensitivity of different experiments to cosmological parameters.\nWe test this method on exact theory $C_l$ as well as on a Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP)-like CMB data set generated from a random realization\nof a fiducial cosmology, comparing the compression results to those from a full\nlikelihood analysis using CosmoMC. After showing that the method works, we\napply it to the temperature power spectrum from the WMAP seven-year data\nrelease, and discuss the successes and limitations of our method as applied to\na real data set.\n", "  Superoscillatory wave forms, i.e., waves that locally oscillate faster than\ntheir highest Fourier component, possess unusual properties that make them of\ngreat interest from quantum mechanics to signal processing. However, the more\npronounced the desired superoscillatory behavior is to be, the more difficult\nit becomes to produce, or even only calculate, such highly fine-tuned wave\nforms in practice. Here, we investigate how this sensitivity to preparation\nerrors scales for a method for constructing superoscillatory functions which is\noptimal in the sense that it minimizes the energetic expense. We thereby also\narrive at very accurate approximations of functions which are so highly\nsuperoscillatory that they cannot be calculated numerically. We then\ninvestigate to what extent the scaling and sensitivity results for\nsuperoscillatory functions on the real line extend to the experimentally\nimportant case of superoscillatory functions that are periodic.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the balance of the static magnetic and the\ndynamical photon forces in the electron transport through a quantum dot in a\nphoton cavity with a single photon mode. The quantum dot system is connected to\nexternal leads and the total system is exposed to a static perpendicular\nmagnetic field. We explore the transport characteristics through the system by\ntuning the ratio, $\\hbar\\omega_{\\gamma} / \\hbar\\omega_c$, between the photon\nenergy, $\\hbar\\omega_{\\gamma}$, and the cyclotron energy, $\\hbar\\omega_c$.\nEnhancement in the electron transport with increasing electron-photon coupling\nis observed when $\\hbar\\omega_{\\gamma} / \\hbar\\omega_c > 1$. In this case the\nphoton field dominates and stretches the electron charge distribution in the\nquantum dot, extending it towards the contacts area for the leads. Suppression\nin the electron transport is found when $\\hbar\\omega_{\\gamma} / \\hbar\\omega_c <\n1$, as the external magnetic field causes circular confinement of the charge\ndensity around the dot.\n", "  The detection of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) in the solar neighborhood would have\nvery important implications for GRB phenomenology. The leading theories for\ncosmological GRBs would not be able to explain such events. The final bursts of\nevaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), however, would be a natural\nexplanation for local GRBs. We present a novel technique that can constrain the\ndistance to gamma-ray bursts using detections from widely separated,\nnon-imaging spacecraft. This method can determine the actual distance to the\nburst if it is local. We applied this method to constrain distances to a sample\nof 36 short duration GRBs detected by the Interplanetary Network (IPN) that\nshow observational properties that are expected from PBH evaporations. These\nbursts have minimum possible distances in the 10^13-10^18 cm (7-10^5 AU) range,\nconsistent with the expected PBH energetics and with a possible origin in the\nsolar neighborhood, although none of the bursts can be unambiguously\ndemonstrated to be local. Assuming these bursts are real PBH events, we\nestimate lower limits on the PBH burst evaporation rate in the solar\nneighborhood.\n", "  The non-equilibrium spatial dynamics in a two-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensate were excited by controlled miscible-immiscible transition, in which\nimmiscible condensates with domain structures are transferred to the miscible\ncondensates by changing the internal state of 87Rb atoms. The subsequent\nevolution exhibits the oscillation of spatial structures involving component\nmixing and separation. We show that the larger total energy of the miscible\nsystem results in a higher oscillation frequency. This investigation introduces\na new technique to control the miscibility and the spatial degrees of freedom\nin atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  In the last few years a lot of exotic and anomalous topological phases were\nconstructed by proliferating the vortex like topological defects on the surface\nof the $3d$ topological insulator (TI). In this work, rather than considering\ntopological phases at the boundary, we will study quantum critical points\ndriven by vortex like topological defects. In general we will discuss a\n$(2+1)d$ quantum phase transition described by the following field theory:\n$\\mathcal{L} = \\bar{\\psi}\\gamma_\\mu (\\partial_\\mu - i a_\\mu) \\psi +\n|(\\partial_\\mu - i k a_\\mu)\\phi|^2 + r |\\phi|^2 + g |\\phi|^4$, with tuning\nparameter $r$, arbitrary integer $k$, Dirac fermion $\\psi$ and complex scalar\nbosonic field $\\phi$ which both couple to the same $(2+1)d$ dynamical\nnoncompact U(1) gauge field $a_\\mu$. The physical meaning of these\nquantities/fields will be explained in the text. We demonstrate that this\nquantum critical point has a quasi self-dual nature. And at this quantum\ncritical point, various universal quantities such as the electrical\nconductivity, and scaling dimension of gauge invariant operators can be\ncalculated systematically through a $1/k^2$ expansion, based on the observation\nthat the limit $k \\rightarrow + \\infty$ corresponds to an ordinary $3d$ XY\ntransition.\n", "  We compute the informational power for the Hoggar SIC-POVM in dimension 8,\ni.e. the classical capacity of a quantum-classical channel generated by this\nmeasurement. We show that the states constituting a maximally informative\nensemble form a twin Hoggar SIC-POVM being the image of the original one under\na conjugation.\n", "  Towards understanding the multi-orbital quantum antiferromagnetism in iron\npnictides, effective spin couplings and spin fluctuation induced quantum\ncorrections to sublattice magnetization are obtained in the $(\\pi,0)$ AF state\nof a realistic three band interacting electron model involving $xz$, $yz$, and\n$xy$ Fe 3d orbitals. The $xy$ orbital is found to be mainly responsible for the\ngeneration of strong ferromagnetic spin coupling in the $b$ direction, which is\ncritically important to fully account for the spin wave dispersion as measured\nin inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The ferromagnetic spin coupling is\nstrongly suppressed as the $xy$ band approaches half filling, and is ascribed\nto particle-hole exchange in the partially filled $xy$ band. The strongest AF\nspin coupling in the $a$ direction is found to be in the orbital off diagonal\nsector involving the $xz$ and $xy$ orbitals. First order quantum corrections to\nsublattice magnetization are evaluated for the three orbitals, and yield a\nsignificant $37\\%$ average reduction from the Hartree-Fock value.\n", "  We propose exact quantization conditions for the quantum integrable systems\nof Goncharov and Kenyon, based on the enumerative geometry of the corresponding\ntoric Calabi-Yau manifolds. Our conjecture builds upon recent results on the\nquantization of mirror curves, and generalizes a previous proposal for the\nquantization of the relativistic Toda lattice. We present explicit tests of our\nconjecture for the integrable systems associated to the resolved C^3/Z_5 and\nC^3/Z_6 orbifolds.\n", "  During the first several days after explosion, Type Ia supernova light curves\nprobe the outer layers of the exploding star and therefore provide important\nclues for identifying their progenitors. We investigate how both the shallow\n$^{56}$Ni distribution and the presence of circumstellar material shape these\nearly light curves. This is performed using a series of numerical experiments\nwith parameterized properties for systematic exploration. Although not all of\nthe considered models may be realized in nature (and indeed there are arguments\nwhy some of them should not occur), the spirit of this work is to provide a\nbroader exploration of the diversity of possibilities. We find that shallower\n$^{56}$Ni leads to steeper, bluer light curves. Differences in the shape of the\nrise can introduce errors in estimating the explosion time and thus impact\nefforts to infer upper limits on the progenitor or companion radius from a lack\nof observed shock cooling emission. Circumstellar material can lead to\nsignificant luminosity during the first few days, but its presence can be\ndifficult to identify depending on the degree of nickel mixing. In some cases,\nthe hot emission of circumstellar material may even lead to a signature similar\nto interaction with a companion, and thus in the future additional diagnostics\nshould be gathered for properly assessing early light curves.\n", "  We calculate analytically the R\\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropy\n$S_{\\alpha}$ of the ground state of $1+1$ dimensional conformal field theories\n(CFT) after performing a projective measurement in a part of the system. We\nshow that the entanglement entropy in this setup is dependent on the central\ncharge and the operator content of the system. When the measurement region $A$\nseparates the two parts $B$ and $\\bar{B}$, the entanglement entropy between $B$\nand $\\bar{B}$ decreases like a power-law with respect to the characteristic\ndistance between the two regions with an exponent which is dependent on the\nrank $\\alpha$ of the R\\'enyi entanglement entropy and the smallest scaling\ndimension present in the system. We check our findings by making numerical\ncalculations on the Klein-Gordon field theory (coupled harmonic oscillators)\nafter fixing the position (partial measurement) of some of the oscillators. We\nalso comment on the post-measurement entanglement entropy in the massive\nquantum field theories.\n", "  We present results of our research on two-field (two-frequency) microwave\nspectroscopy in nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) color centers in a diamond. Both fields\nare tuned to transitions between the spin sublevels of the NV- ensemble in the\n3A2 ground state (one field has a fixed frequency while the second one is\nscanned). Particular attention is focused on the case where two microwaves\nfields drive the same transition between two NV- ground state sublevels (ms=0\n-> ms=+1). In this case, the observed spectra exhibit a complex narrow\nstructure composed of three Lorentzian resonances positioned at the pump-field\nfrequency. The resonance widths and amplitudes depend on the lifetimes of the\nlevels involved in the transition. We attribute the spectra to coherent\npopulation oscillations induced by the two nearly degenerate microwave fields,\nwhich we have also observed in real time. The observations agree well with a\ntheoretical model and can be useful for investigation of the NV relaxation\nmechanisms.\n", "  Coarse resolution numerical ocean models must typically include a\nparameterisation for mesoscale turbulence. A common recipe for such\nparameterisations is to invoke down-gradient mixing, or diffusion, of some\ntracer quantity, such as potential vorticity or buoyancy. However, it is well\nknown that eddy fluxes include large rotational components which necessarily do\nnot lead to any mixing; eddy diffusivities diagnosed from unfiltered fluxes are\nthus contaminated by the presence of these rotational components. Here a new\nmethodology is applied whereby eddy diffusivities are diagnosed directly from\nthe eddy force function. The eddy force function depends only upon flux\ndivergences, is independent of any rotational flux components, and is\ninherently non-local and smooth. A one-shot inversion procedure is applied,\nminimising the mis-match between parameterised force functions and force\nfunctions derived from eddy resolving calculations. This enables diffusivities\nassociated with the eddy potential vorticity and buoyancy fluxes to be\ndiagnosed. The methodology is applied to multi-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean\ngyre simulations. It is found that: (i) a strictly down-gradient mixing scheme\nhas limited success in reducing the mis-match compared to one with no sign\nconstraint on the diffusivity; (ii) negative signals of diffusivities are\nprevalent around the time-mean jet; (iii) there is some indication that the\nmagnitude of the diffusivity correlates well the eddy energy. Implications for\nparameterisation are discussed in light of these diagnostic results.\n", "  We study the decay process of $J/\\psi\\rightarrow e^+e^- \\phi$ where the\nrelatively clean electromagnetic (EM) transitions appear at leading order at\ntree level while the hadronic contributions only emerge via hadronic loop\ntransitions. We include the low-lying scalar $f_0(980)$ and pseudoscalar\n$\\eta/\\eta'$ as the dominant contributions in the evaluation of the hadronic\nloop contributions. It is found that the hadronic effects are negligible\ncomparing with the EM contributions. The decay width of $J/\\psi\\rightarrow\ne^+e^- \\phi$ is determined to be about $2.12\\times 10^{-6}$ keV if there is no\nany other leading mechanism contributing, and this result will be tested by the\nBESIII experiment with a large data sample of $J/\\psi$.\n", "  It is well stablished that danger information can be transmitted by ants\nthrough relatively small distances, provoking either a state of alarm when they\nmove away from potentially dangerous stimulus, or charge toward it\naggressively. There is almost no knowledge if danger information can be\ntransmitted along large distances. In this paper, we perturb leaf cutting ants\nof the species Atta insularis while they forage in their natural evioronment at\na certain point of the foraging line, so ants make a \"U\" turn to escape from\nthe danger zone and go back to the nest. Our results strongly suggest that\nthose ants do not transmit \"danger information\" to other nestmates marching\ntowards the danger area. The individualistic behavior of the ants returning\nfrom the danger zone results in a depression of the foraging activity due to\nthe systematic sacrifice of non-informed individuals.\n", "  Employing recent results on stochastic differential equations associated with\nthe standard model of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics by B. G\\\"uneysu,\nJ.S. M{\\o}ller, and the present author, we study the continuity of the\ncorresponding semi-group between weighted vector-valued L^p-spaces, continuity\nproperties of elements in the range of the semi-group, and the pointwise\ncontinuity of an operator-valued semi-group kernel. We further discuss the\ncontinuous dependence of the semi-group and its integral kernel on model\nparameters. All these results are obtained for Kato decomposable electrostatic\npotentials and the actual assumptions on the model are general enough to cover\nthe Nelson model as well. As a corollary we obtain some new pointwise\nexponential decay and continuity results on elements of low-energetic spectral\nsubspaces of atoms or molecules that also take spin into account. In a simpler\nsituation where spin is neglected we explain how to verify the joint continuity\nof positive ground state eigenvectors with respect to spatial coordinates and\nmodel parameters. There are no smallness assumptions imposed on any model\nparameter.\n", "  This work presents a theoretical explanation for a crossover in the linear\nbehavior in Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots based on cold field electron emission\n(CFE) experimental data. It is characterized by a clear change in the decay\nrate of usually single-slope FN plots, and has been reported when non-uniform\nnano-emitters are subject to high macroscopic electric field $F_M$. We assume\nthat the number of emitting spots, which defines an apparent formal area\nefficiency of CFE surfaces, depends on the macroscopic electric field.\nNon-uniformity is described by local enhancement factors\n$\\left\\{\\gamma_j\\right\\}$, which are randomly assigned to each distinct emitter\nof a conducting CFE surface, from a discrete probability distribution\n$\\rho{(\\gamma_{j})}$, with $j=1,2$. It is assumed that $\\rho{(\\gamma_{1})} <\n\\rho{(\\gamma_{2})}$, and that $\\gamma_{1} > \\gamma_{2}$. The local current\ndensity is evaluated by considering a usual Schottky-Nordheim barrier. The\nresults reproduce the two distinct slope regimes in FN plots when $F_M \\in $\n$[2,20]$ V/$\\mu$m and are analyzed by taking into account the apparent formal\narea efficiency, the distribution $\\rho$, and the slopes in the corresponding\nFN plot. Finally, we remark that our results from numerical solution of\nLaplace's equation, for an array of conducting nano-emitters with uniform apex\nradii $50$ nm but different local height, supports our theoretical assumptions\nand could used in orthodox CFE experiments to test our predictions.\n", "  After recapitulating the procedure to find the bands and the states occurring\nin the $\\mathcal{D}_{3h}$ alpha-cluster model of $^{12}$C in which the clusters\nare placed at the vertexes of an equilateral triangle, we obtain the selection\nrules for electromagnetic transitions. While the alpha cluster structure leads\nto the cancellation of E1 transitions, the approximations carried out in\nderiving the roto-vibrational hamiltonian lead to the disappearance of M1\ntransitions. Furthermore, although in general the lowest active modes are E2,\nE3, $\\cdots$ and M2, M3, $\\cdots$, the cancellation of M2, M3 and M5\ntransitions between certain bands also occurs, as a result of the application\nof group theoretical techniques drawn from molecular physics. These\nimplications can be very relevant for the spectroscopic analysis of\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra of $^{12}$C.\n", "  We present the results of numerical studies of laser pulse propagating in a\n3.5 cm Rb vapor cell in the linear dispersion regime by using a 1D model and a\n2D code that has been modified for our special case. The 2D simulation finally\naimed at finding laser beam parameters suitable to make the Rb vapor fully\nionized to obtain a uniform, 10 m-long, at least 1 mm in radius plasma in the\nnext step for the AWAKE experiment.\n", "  The sky-averaged, or global, background of redshifted $21$ cm radiation is\nexpected to be a rich source of information on cosmological reheating and\nreionizaton. However, measuring the signal is technically challenging: one must\nextract a small, frequency-dependent signal from under much brighter spectrally\nsmooth foregrounds. Traditional approaches to study the global signal have used\nsingle antennas, which require one to calibrate out the frequency-dependent\nstructure in the overall system gain (due to internal reflections, for example)\nas well as remove the noise bias from auto-correlating a single amplifier\noutput. This has motivated proposals to measure the signal using\ncross-correlations in interferometric setups, where additional calibration\ntechniques are available. In this paper we focus on the general principles\ndriving the sensitivity of the interferometric setups to the global signal. We\nprove that this sensitivity is directly related to two characteristics of the\nsetup: the cross-talk between readout channels (i.e. the signal picked up at\none antenna when the other one is driven) and the correlated noise due to\nthermal fluctuations of lossy elements (e.g. absorbers or the ground) radiating\ninto both channels. Thus in an interferometric setup, one cannot suppress\ncross-talk and correlated thermal noise without reducing sensitivity to the\nglobal signal by the same factor -- instead, the challenge is to characterize\nthese effects and their frequency dependence. We illustrate our general theorem\nby explicit calculations within toy setups consisting of two short dipole\nantennas in free space and above a perfectly reflecting ground surface, as well\nas two well-separated identical lossless antennas arranged to achieve zero\ncross-talk.\n", "  We theoretically study the magnetoelectric coupling in a quantum anomalous\nHall insulator state induced by interfacing a dynamic magnetization texture to\na topological insulator. In particular, we propose that the quantum anomalous\nHall insulator with a magnetic configuration of a domain wall, when contacted\nby electrical reservoirs, acts as a magnetoelectric piston. A moving domain\nwall pumps charge current between electrical leads in a closed circuit, while\napplying an electrical bias induces reciprocal domain-wall motion. This\npiston-like action is enabled by a finite reflection of charge carriers via\nchiral modes imprinted by the domain wall. Moreover, we find that, when\ncompared with the recently discovered spin-orbit torque-induced domain-wall\nmotion in heavy metals, the reflection coefficient plays the role of an\neffective spin-Hall angle governing the efficiency of the proposed electrical\ncontrol of domain walls. Quantitatively, this effective spin-Hall angle is\nfound to approach a universal value of $2$, providing an efficient scheme to\nreconfigure the domain-wall chiral interconnects for possible memory and logic\napplications.\n", "  Collapsing shells form horizons, and when the curvature is small classical\ngeneral relativity is believed to describe this process arbitrarily well. On\nthe other hand, quantum information theory based (fuzzball/firewall) arguments\nsuggest the existence of some structure at the black hole horizon. This\nstructure can only form if classical general relativity stops being the correct\ndescription of the collapsing shell before it reaches the horizon size. We\npresent strong evidence that classical general relativity can indeed break down\nprematurely, by explicitly computing the quantum tunneling amplitude of a\ncollapsing shell of branes into smooth horizonless microstate geometries. We\nshow that the amplitude for tunneling into microstate geometries with a large\nnumber of topologically non-trivial cycles is parametrically larger than\nexp(-S), which indicates that the shell can tunnel into a horizonless\nconfiguration long before the horizon has any chance to form. We also use this\ntechnology to investigate the tunneling of M2 branes into LLM bubbling\ngeometries.\n", "  The Advanced Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE)\naims at studying plasma wakefield generation and electron acceleration driven\nby proton bunches. It is a proof-of-principle R&D experiment at CERN and the\nworld's first proton driven plasma wakefield acceleration experiment. The AWAKE\nexperiment will be installed in the former CNGS facility and uses the 400 GeV/c\nproton beam bunches from the SPS. The first experiments will focus on the\nself-modulation instability of the long (rms ~12 cm) proton bunch in the\nplasma. These experiments are planned for the end of 2016. Later, in 2017/2018,\nlow energy (~15 MeV) electrons will be externally injected to sample the\nwakefields and be accelerated beyond 1 GeV. The main goals of the experiment\nwill be summarized. A summary of the AWAKE design and construction status will\nbe presented.\n", "  Changes of surface gravity on Earth are of great interest in geodesy, earth\nsciences and natural resource exploration. They are indicative of Earth\nsystem's mass redistributions and vertical surface motion, and are usually\nmeasured with falling corner-cube- and superconducting gravimeters (FCCG and\nSCG). Here we report on absolute gravity measurements with a mobile quantum\ngravimeter based on atom interferometry. The measurements were conducted in\nGermany and Sweden over periods of several days with simultaneous SCG and FCCG\ncomparisons. They show the best-reported performance of mobile atomic\ngravimeters to date with an accuracy of $\\mathrm{39\\,nm/s^2}$ and long-term\nstability of $\\mathrm{0.5\\,nm/s^2}$ short-term noise of\n$96\\,\\mathrm{nm/s^2/\\sqrt{Hz}}$. These measurements highlight the unique\nproperties of atomic sensors. The achieved level of performance in a\ntransportable instrument enables new applications in geodesy and related\nfields, such as continuous absolute gravity monitoring with a single instrument\nunder rough environmental conditions.\n", "  We study in detail the little-Higgs model proposed by Low, Skiba and Smith\nwith an SU(6)/Sp(6) group structure. The effective theory at the TeV scale is a\ntwo-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with additional heavy vector-like fermions and\nvector-bosons. We identify a set of independent input parameters and develop\nexpressions for masses and couplings in terms of these. We perform a random\nscan of the parameter space and find points that satisfy constraints, including\nthe recent 8 TeV LHC Higgs measurements, namely, the Higgs mass, Higgs\ncouplings to the top, bottom, $\\tau$, $W^\\pm$ and $Z$, top-quark mass, and\ncollider bounds on colored vector-like fermions ($t'$ and $b'$), and also\nprecision electroweak constraints. The LHC constraints on the $hWW$ and $hZZ$\ncouplings are satisfied by being close to the \"alignment limit\". We find how\nfine-tuned the model is after including these constraints. For the points that\nsatisfy the constraints, we present the 1-loop effective couplings of the\nCP-even and CP-odd neutral scalars to two gluons including contributions of\nstandard model and heavy vector-like quarks. We also present the branching\nratios of the heavy neutral scalars into the $\\gamma\\gamma,\\, \\tau\\bar\\tau,\\,\nb\\bar b,\\, t\\bar t, WW, ZZ, Zh, hh$ modes, and the heavy charged scalar into\n$tb,\\, \\tau\\nu, cs, W h$ modes. These will aid searches of the heavy scalars at\nthe LHC and other future colliders.\n", "  I present a streamlined review of how the separate universe approach to\ncosmological perturbation theory can be used to study the dynamics of\nlong-wavelength scalar perturbations in loop quantum cosmology, and then use it\nto calculate how long-wavelength curvature perturbations evolve across the loop\nquantum cosmology bounce assuming a constant equation of state. A similar\ncalculation is possible for tensor modes using results from a complementary\napproach to cosmological perturbation theory in loop quantum cosmology based on\nan effective Hamiltonian constraint. An interesting result is that the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio can be suppressed or amplified by quantum gravity\neffects during the bounce, depending on the equation of state of the matter\nfield dominating the dynamics. In particular, if the equation of state lies\nbetween -1/3 and 1, the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio will be suppressed\nduring the bounce, in some cases significantly.\n", "  In Stealth Supersymmetry, bounds on superpartners from direct searches can be\nnotably weaker than in standard supersymmetric scenarios, due to suppressed\nmissing energy. We present a set of simplified models of Stealth Supersymmetry\nthat motivate 13 TeV LHC searches. We focus on simplified models within the\nNatural Supersymmetry framework, in which the gluino, stop, and Higgsino are\nassumed to be lighter than other superpartners. Our simplified models exhibit\nnovel decay patterns that differ significantly from topologies of the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, with and without $R$-parity. We determine limits\non stops and gluinos from searches at the 8 TeV LHC. Existing searches\nconstitute a powerful probe of Stealth Supersymmetry gluinos with certain\ntopologies. However, we identify simplified models where the gluino can be\nconsiderably lighter than 1 TeV. Stops are significantly less constrained in\nStealth Supersymmetry than the MSSM, and we have identified novel stop decay\ntopologies that are completely unconstrained by existing LHC searches.\n", "  We consider the usage of dynamical decoupling in quantum metrology, where the\njoint evolution of system plus environment is described by a Hamiltonian. We\ndemonstrate that by ultra-fast unitary control operations acting locally only\non system qubits, essentially all kinds of noise can be eliminated. This is\ndone in such a way that the desired evolution is reduced by at most a constant\nfactor, leading to Heisenberg scaling. The only exception is noise that is\ngenerated by the Hamiltonian to be estimated itself. However, even for such\nparallel noise, one can achieve an improved scaling as compared to the standard\nquantum limit for any local noise by means of symmetrization.\n", "  A formula expressing the fermionic determinant as an infinite product of\nsmaller determinants is derived and discussed. These smaller determinants are\nof a fixed size, independent of the size of the lattice and are indexed by\nloops of increasing length.\n", "  We consider a massless quantum scalar field on a two-dimensional space-time\ndescribing a thin shell of matter collapsing to form a Schwarzschild-anti-de\nSitter black hole. At early times, before the shell starts to collapse, the\nquantum field is in the vacuum state, corresponding to the Boulware vacuum on\nan eternal black hole space-time. The scalar field satisfies reflecting\nboundary conditions on the anti-de Sitter boundary. Using the\nDavies-Fulling-Unruh prescription for computing the renormalized expectation\nvalue of the stress-energy tensor, we find that at late times the black hole is\nin thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at the Hawking temperature, so the\nquantum field is in a state analogous to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum on an\neternal black hole space-time.\n", "  The investigation of beam halo transverse distributions is important for the\nunderstanding of beam losses and the control of backgrounds in Future Linear\nColliders (FLC). A novel in vacuum diamond sensor (DSv) scanner with four\nstrips has been designed and developed for the investigation of the beam halo\ntransverse distributions and also for the diagnostics of Compton recoil\nelectrons after the interaction point (IP) of ATF2, a low energy (1.3 GeV)\nprototype of the final focus system for the ILC and CLIC linear collider\nprojects. Using the DSv, a dynamic range of $\\sim10^6$ has been successfully\ndemonstrated and confirmed for the first time by simultaneous beam core\n($\\sim10^9$ electrons) and beam halo ($\\sim10^3$ electrons) measurements at\nATF2. This report presents the characterization, performance studies and tests\nof the diamond sensors using an $\\alpha$ source as well as using the electron\nbeams at PHIL, a low energy ($< 10$ MeV) photo-injector at LAL, and at ATF2.\nFirst beam halo measurement results using the DSv at ATF2 with different beam\nintensities and vacuum levels are also presented. Such measurements not only\nallow one to evaluate the different sources of beam halo generation but also to\ndefine the requirements for a suitable collimation system to be installed at\nATF2, as well as to optimize its performance during future operation.\n", "  It is shown that the vector current contribution of neutrino interaction with\nelectrons in ion gives rise to oscillating component, which is absent for the\naxial-vector contribution, when a single neutrino is detected in the recently\nproposed neutrino pair beam. CP violation measurements are thus possible with\nhigh precision along with determination of mass hierarchical patterns.\n", "  The field effect in metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors plays a key\nrole in field-effect transistors (FETs), which are the fundamental building\nblocks of modern digital integrated circuits. Recent works show that the field\neffect can also be used to make optical/plasmonic modulators. In this paper, we\nreport field effect electro-absorption modulators (FEOMs) each made of an\nultrathin epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) film, as the active material, sandwiched in a\nsilicon or plasmonic waveguide. Without a bias, the ENZ film maximizes the\nattenuation of the waveguides and the modulators work at the OFF state;\ncontrariwise, depletion of the carriers in the ENZ film greatly reduces the\nattenuation and the modulators work at the ON state. The double capacitor\ngating scheme is used to enhance the modulation by the field effect. According\nto our simulation, extinction ratio up to 3.44 dB can be achieved in a 500-nm\nlong Si waveguide with insertion loss only 0.71 dB (85.0%); extinction ratio up\nto 7.86 dB can be achieved in a 200-nm long plasmonic waveguide with insertion\nloss 1.11 dB (77.5%). The proposed modulators may find important applications\nin future on-chip or chip-to-chip optical interconnection.\n", "  Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has been widely used in medical imaging\nand industrial nondestructive testing, but the presence of scattered radiation\nwill cause significant reduction of image quality. In this article, a robust\nscatter correction method for CBCT using an interlacing-slit plate (ISP) is\ncarried out for convenient practice. Firstly, a Gaussian filtering method is\nproposed to compensate the missing data of the inner scatter image, and\nsimultaneously avoid too-large values of calculated inner scatter and smooth\nthe inner scatter field. Secondly, an interlacing-slit scan without detector\ngain correction is carried out to enhance the practicality and convenience of\nthe scatter correction method. Finally, a denoising step for scatter-corrected\nprojection images is added in the process flow to control the noise\namplification. The experimental results show that the improved method can not\nonly make the scatter correction more robust and convenient, but also achieve a\ngood quality of scatter-corrected slice images.\n", "  We study a physical system consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined\nto a ring shaped lattice potential interrupted by three weak links. The system\nis assumed to be driven by an effective flux piercing the ring lattice. By\nemploying path integral techniques, we explore the effective quantum dynamics\nof the system in a pure quantum phase dynamics regime. Moreover, the effects of\nthe density's quantum fluctuations are studied through exact diagonalization\nanalysis of the spectroscopy of the Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate that a\nclear two-level system emerges by tuning the magnetic flux at degeneracy. The\nlattice confinement, platform for the condensate, is realized experimentally\nemploying a spatial light modulator.\n", "  Recently, we proposed a unified mass matrix model for quarks and leptons, in\nwhich, mass ratios and mixings of the quarks and neutrinos are described by\nusing only the observed charged lepton mass values as family-number-dependent\nparameters and only six family-number-independent free parameters. In spite of\nquite few parameters, the model gives remarkable agreement with observed data\n(i.e. CKM mixing, PMNS mixing and mass ratios). Taking this phenomenological\nsuccess seriously, we give a formulation of the so-called Yukawaon model in\ndetails from a theoretical aspect, especially for the construction of\nsuperpotentials and $R$ charge assignments of fields. The model is considerably\nmodified from the previous one, while the phenomenological success is kept\nunchanged.\n", "  In this talk, I present the minimal classically scale-invariant and\n$CP$-symmetric extension of the standard model, containing one additional\ncomplex gauge singlet and three flavors of right-handed Majorana neutrinos,\nincorporated within a renormalizable framework of gravity, consistent with\nthese symmetries; the Agravity. I particularly focus on the slow-roll\ninflationary paradigm within this framework, by identifying the\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the (approximate) scale symmetry with the\ninflaton field, constructing its one-loop effective potential, computing the\nslow-roll parameters and the inflationary observables, and demonstrating the\ncompatibility of the small field inflation scenario with the latest Planck\ncollaboration data sets.\n", "  Low scale string models naturally have axion-like pseudoscalars which couple\ndirectly to gluons and photons (but not $W$s) at tree level. We show how they\ntypically get tree level masses in the presence of closed string fluxes,\nconsistent with the axion discrete gauge symmetry, in a way akin of the axion\nmonodromy of string inflation and relaxion models. We discuss the possibility\nthat the hints for a resonance at 750 GeV recently reported at ATLAS and CMS\ncould correspond to such a heavy axion state (megaxion). Adjusting the\nproduction rate and branching ratios suggests the string scale to be of order\n$M_s$ ~ $7 - 10^4$ TeV, depending on the compactification geometry. If this\ninterpretation was correct, one extra $Z'$ gauge boson could be produced before\nreaching the string threshold at LHC and future colliders.\n", "  The measurement of Higgs pair production will be a cornerstone of the LHC\nprogram in the coming years. Double Higgs production provides a crucial window\nupon the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and has a unique\nsensitivity to the Higgs trilinear coupling. We study the feasibility of a\nmeasurement of Higgs pair production in the $b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$ final state at\nthe LHC. Our analysis is based on a combination of traditional cut-based\nmethods with state-of-the-art multivariate techniques. We account for all\nrelevant backgrounds, including the contributions from light and charm jet\nmis-identification, which are ultimately comparable in size to the irreducible\n$4b$ QCD background. We demonstrate the robustness of our analysis strategy in\na high pileup environment. For an integrated luminosity of $\\mathcal{L}=3$\nab$^{-1}$, a signal significance of $S/\\sqrt{B}\\simeq 3$ is obtained,\nindicating that the $b\\bar{b}b\\bar{b}$ final state alone could allow for the\nobservation of double Higgs production at the High-Luminosity LHC.\n", "  The subject of optomechanics involves interactions between optical and\nmechanical degrees of freedom, and is currently of great interest as an enabler\nof fundamental investigations in quantum mechanics, as well as a platform for\nultrasensitive measurement devices. The majority of optomechanical\nconfigurations rely on the exchange of linear momentum between light and\nmatter. We will begin this tutorial with a brief description of such systems.\nSubsequently, we will introduce optomechanical systems based on angular\nmomentum exchange. In this context, optical fields carrying polarization and\norbital angular momentum will be considered, while for the mechanics, torsional\nand free rotational motion will be of relevance. Our overall aims will be to\nsupply basic analyses of some of the existing theoretical proposals, to provide\nfunctional descriptions of some of the experiments conducted thus far, and to\nconsider some directions for future research. We hope this tutorial will be\nuseful to both theorists and experimentalists interested in the subject.\n", "  Non-Standard neutral current Interactions (NSIs) of neutrinos with matter can\nalter the pattern of neutrino oscillation due to the coherent forward\nscattering of neutrinos on the medium. This effect makes long-baseline neutrino\nexperiments such as NO$\\nu$A and DUNE a sensitive probe of beyond standard\nmodel (BSM) physics. We construct light mediator models that can give rise to\nboth lepton flavor conserving as well as Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) neutral\ncurrent NSI. We outline the present phenomenological viability of these models\nand future prospects to test them. We predict a lower bound on Br$(H\\to \\mu\n\\tau)$ in terms of the parameters that can be measured by DUNE and NO$\\nu$A,\nand show that the hint for $H\\to \\mu \\tau$ in current LHC data can be\naccommodated in our model. A large part of the parameter space of the model is\nalready constrained by the bounds on Br$(\\tau \\to Z^\\prime \\mu)$ and rare meson\ndecays and can in principle fully tested by improving these bounds.\n", "  In this work we investigated thin films of the ferrimagnetic insulators YIG\nand NFO capped with thin Pt layers in terms of the longitudinal spin Seebeck\neffect (LSSE). The electric response detected in the Pt layer under an\nout-of-plane temperature gradient can be interpreted as a pure spin current\nconverted into a charge current via the inverse spin Hall effect. Typically,\nthe transverse voltage is the quantity investigated in LSSE measurements (in\nthe range of \\mu V). Here, we present the directly detected DC current (in the\nrange of nA) as an alternative quantity. Furthermore, we investigate the\nresistance of the Pt layer in the LSSE configuration. We found an influence of\nthe test current on the resistance. The typical shape of the LSSE curve varies\nfor increasing test currents.\n", "  Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory is the classic approach to soft matter\nelectrostatics which has been applied to numerous problems of physical\nchemistry and biophysics. Its essential limitations are the neglect of\ncorrelation effects and of fluid structure. Recently, several theoretical\ninsights have allowed the formulation of approaches that go beyond PB theory in\na systematic way. In this topical review we provide an update on the\ndevelopments achieved in self-consistent formulations of correlation-corrected\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory. We introduce the corresponding system of coupled\nnonlinear equations for both continuum electrostatics with a uniform dielectric\nconstant and a structured solvent, a dipolar Coulomb fluid, including nonlocal\neffects. While the approach is only approximate and also limited to corrections\nin the so-called weak fluctuation regime, it allows to include physically\nrelevant effects, as we show for a range of applications of these equations.\n", "  The empty perovskite ScF3 exhibits negative thermal expansion up to 1100 K.\nWe demonstrate that ab-initio calculations of temperature-dependent effective\nphonon spectra allow to quantitatively describe the behavior of this compound\nand the suppression of negative thermal expansion. Based on this result, we\npredict an anomalous temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity and\ninterpret it as a general feature of the perovskite class. Finally, we comment\non the fact that the suppression of negative thermal expansion at such a high\ntemperature is beyond the reach of the quasi-harmonic approximation and we\ndiscuss this suppression based on the temperature-dependence of the mode\nGr\\\"uneisen parameters.\n", "  In this letter we study the negativity of one dimensional free fermions. We\nderive the general form of the $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ symmetric term in moments of\nthe partial transposed (reduced) density matrix, which is an algebraic function\nof the end points of the system. Such a path integral turns out to be a\nconvenient tool for making estimations for the negativity.\n", "  The analogue of the paramagnetic to spin-glass phase transition in disordered\nmagnetic systems, leading to the phenomenon of replica symmetry breaking, has\nbeen recently demonstrated in a two-dimensional random laser consisting of an\norganic-based amorphous solid-state thin film. We report here the first\ndemonstration of replica symmetry breaking in a one-dimensional photonic system\nconsisting of an erbium-doped random fiber laser operating in the\ncontinuous-wave regime based on a unique random fiber grating system, which\nplays the role of the random scatterers and operates in the Anderson\nlocalization regime. The clear transition from a photonic paramagnetic to a\nphotonic spin glass phase, characterized by the probability distribution\nfunction of the Parisi overlap, was verified and characterized. In this unique\nsystem, the radiation field interacts only with the gain medium, and the fiber\ngrating, which provides the disordered feedback mechanism, does not interfere\nwith the pump.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions and multiferroics are the most interesting objects in\nnanostructure science that have great potential in future spin-electronic\ntechnology. The study of the multiferroic skyrmions has attracted much interest\nin recent years. This paper reports on the magnetic skyrmions induced by an\nelectric driving field on a composite multiferroic lattice. By using the spin\ndynamics method, we use a classical magnetic spin model and an electric\npseudospin model, which are coupled by a strong magnetoelectric coupling in the\ndynamical simulations. Interestingly, we observe some skyrmion-like objects on\nthe electric component during the switching process, which is due to the\nconnection between the electric and the magnetic structures.\n", "  Indium arsenide (InAs) nanowires (NWs) are a promising platform to fabricate\nquantum electronic devices, among others they have strong spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI). The controlled tuning of the SOI is desired in spin based\nquantum devices. In this study we investigate the possibility of tuning the SOI\nby electrostatic field, which is generated by a back gate and two side gates\nplaced on the opposite sides of the NW. The strength of the SOI is analyzed by\nweak anti-localization effect. We demonstrate that the strength of SOI can be\nstrongly tuned by a factor of 2 with the electric field across the NW, while\nthe average electron density is kept constant. Furthermore a simple\nelectrostatic model is introduced to calculate the expected change of SOI. Good\nagreement is found between the experimental results and the estimated Rashba\ntype SOI generated by the gate-induced electric field.\n", "  We study a system of a finite size charged particle interacting with\nradiation field by exploiting the Hamilton's principle for non-conservative\nsystem introduced recently by Galley[1]. The said formulation leads to the\nequation of motion of the charged particle that turns out to be the same as\nobtained by Jackson[3]. We show that radiation reaction stems from the\nnon-conservative piece of the effective Lagrangian. We notice that a charge\ninteracting with radiation field modeled as heat bath affords a way to justify\nthat radiation reaction is a non-conservative force. The topic is suitable for\ngraduate courses on advanced electrodynamics and classical theory of fields.\n", "  The propagation and divergence properties of beams carrying orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) play a crucial role in many applications. Here we present a\ngeneral study on the divergence of optical beams with OAM. We show that the\nmean absolute value of the OAM imposes a lower bound on the value of the beam\ndivergence. We discuss our results for two different definitions of the\ndivergence, the so called rms or encircled-energy. The bound on the rms\ndivergence can be expressed as a generalized uncertainty principle, with\napplications in long-range communication, microscopy and 2D quantum systems.\n", "  In this paper, we study $(n-1)$-order deformations of an $n$-Lie algebra and\nintroduce the notion of a Nijenhuis operator on an $n$-Lie algebra, which could\ngive rise to trivial deformations. We prove that a polynomial of a Nijenhuis\noperator is still a Nijenhuis operator. Finally, we give various constructions\nof Nijenhuis operators and some examples.\n", "  We present an improvement of short term frequency stability of the\nintegrating sphere cold atom clock after increasing the intensities of clock\nsignals and optimizing the feedback loop of the clock. A short term frequency\nstability of $5.0\\times10^{-13}\\tau^{-1/2}$ has been achieved and the limiting\nfactors have been analyzed.\n", "  Rapidly-spinning magnetars can potentially form by the accretion induced\ncollapse of a white dwarf or by neutron star mergers if the equation of state\nof nuclear density matter is such that two low mass neutron stars can sometimes\nform a massive neutron star rather than a black hole. In either case, the newly\nborn magnetar is an attractive site for producing ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays\n(particles with individual energies exceeding $10^{18}\\,{\\rm eV}$; UHECRs). The\nshort-period spin and strong magnetic field are able to accelerate particles up\nto the appropriate energies, and the composition of material on and around the\nmagnetar may naturally explain recent inferences of heavy elements in UHECRs.\nWe explore whether the small amount of natal debris surrounding these magnetars\nallows the UHECRs to easily escape. We also investigate the impact on the\nUHECRs of the unique environment around the magnetar, which consists of a\nbubble of relativistic particles and magnetic field within the debris. Rates\nand energetics of UHECRs are consistent with such an origin even though the\nrates of events that produce rapidly-spinning magnetars remain very uncertain.\nThe low ejecta mass also helps limit the high-energy neutrino background\nassociated with this scenario to be below current IceCube constraints over most\nof the magnetar parameter space. A unique prediction is that UHECRs may be\ngenerated in old stellar environments without strong star formation in contrast\nto what would be expected for other UHECR scenarios, such as active galactic\nnuclei or long gamma-ray bursts.\n", "  It is known that the large N expansion of the partition function in ABJM\ntheory on a three-sphere is completely determined by the topological string on\nlocal Hirzebruch surface F_0. In this note, we investigate the ABJM partition\nfunction on an ellipsoid, which has a conventional deformation parameter b.\nUsing 3d mirror symmetry, we find a remarkable relation between the ellipsoid\npartition function for b^2=3 (or b^2=1/3) in ABJM theory at k=1 and a matrix\nmodel for the topological string on another Calabi-Yau threefold, known as\nlocal P^2. As in the case of b=1, we can compute the full large N expansion of\nthe partition function in this case. This is the first example of the complete\nlarge N solution in ABJM theory on the squashed sphere. Using the obtained\nresults, we also analyze the supersymmetric Renyi entropy.\n", "  We report the hyperfine splitting (HFS) measurement of cesium (Cs) 7S1/2\nstate by optical-optical double-resonance spectroscopy in the 6S1/2-6P3/2-7S1/2\n(852 nm + 1470 nm) ladder-type system. The HFS frequency calibration is\nperformed by employing a phase-type waveguide electro-optic modulator together\nwith a stable confocal Fabry-Perot cavity. From the measured HFS between F\"= 3\nand F\"= 4 manifolds of Cs 7S1/2 state [HFS = 2183.273(37) MHz], we have\ndetermined the magnetic dipole hyperfine coupling constant [A = 545.818(09)\nMHz], which is in good agreement with the previous work but much more accurate.\n", "  This work introduces a model in which agents of a network act upon one\nanother according to three different kinds of moral decisions. These decisions\nare based on an increasing level of sophistication in the empathy capacity of\nthe agent, a hierarchy which we name Piaget's Ladder. The decision strategy of\nthe agents is non-rational, in the sense that it does not minimize model's\nHamiltonian, and the model presents quenched disorder given by the distribution\nof its defining parameters. We obtain an analytical solution for this model in\nthe thermodynamic limit and also a leading order correction for finite sized\nsystems. Using these results, we show that typical realizations develop a rich\nphase structure with discontinuous non-thermal transitions.\n", "  Considering the octet baryons in relativistic mean field theory and selecting\nentropy per baryon S=1, we calculate and discuss the influence of U boson on\nthe equation of state, mass-radius, moment of inertia and gravitational\nredshift of massive protoneutron star (PNS). The effective coupling constant\n$g_{U}$ of U bosons and nucleons is selected from 0GeV$^{-2}$ to 70GeV$^{-2}$.\nThe results point that U bosons will stiffen the equation of state (EOS). The\ninfluence of U bosons on the pressure is more obvious at low density than high\ndensity, while, the influence of U bosons on the energy density is more obvious\nat high density than low density. The U bosons play a significant role in\nincreasing the maximum mass and radius of PNS. When the value of $g_{U}$\nchanges from 0GeV$^{-2}$ to 70GeV$^{-2}$, the maximum mass of massive PNS\nincreases from 2.11 $M_{\\odot}$ to 2.58 $M_{\\odot}$, and the radius of PNS\ncorresponding PSR J0348+0432 increases from 13.71 km to 24.35 km. The U bosons\nwill increase the moment of inertia and decrease the gravitational redshift of\nPNS. For PNS of the massive PSR J0348+0432, the radius and moment of inertia\nvary directly with $g_{U}$, the gravitational redshift vary inversely with\n$g_{U}$ approximately.\n", "  We study the joint action of the non-Poisson renewal events (NPR) yielding\nContinuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) with index alpha < 1 and two different\ngenerators of Hurst coefficient H not equal to 0.5, one generating fractional\nBrownian motion (FBM) and another scaled Brownian motion (SBM). We discuss the\nergodicity breaking emerging from these joint actions and we find that in both\ncases the adoption of time averages leads to localization. In the case of the\njoint action of NPR and SBM, localization occurs when SBM would produce\nsub-diffusion. The joint action of NPR and FBM, on the contrary, may lead to\nlocalization when FBM would be a source of super-diffusion. We argue that the\nsecond effect might require a refinement of the theoretical perspective about\ndeterminism and randomness.\n", "  The need for Hamiltonians with many-body interactions arises in various\napplications of quantum computing. However, interactions beyond two-body are\ndifficult to realize experimentally. Perturbative gadgets were introduced to\nobtain arbitrary many-body effective interactions using Hamiltonians with\ntwo-body interactions only. Although valid for arbitrary $k$-body interactions,\ntheir use is limited to small $k$ because the strength of interaction is $k$'th\norder in perturbation theory. In this paper we develop a nonperturbative\ntechnique for obtaining effective $k$-body interactions using Hamiltonians\nconsisting of at most $l$-body interactions with $l<k$. This technique works\nbest for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be\nused together with perturbative gadgets to embed Hamiltonians of considerable\ncomplexity in proper subspaces of two-local Hamiltonians. We describe how our\ntechnique can be implemented in a hybrid (gate-based and adiabatic) as well as\nsolely adiabatic quantum computing scheme.\n", "  Using air to displace a viscous fluid contained in Hele-Shaw cell can create\na fingering pattern at the interface between the fluids, if the capillary\nnumber exceeds a critical value. This Saffman-Taylor instability is revisited\nfor the inverse case of a viscous fluid displacing air, when partially wettable\nhydrophilic particles are lying on the walls. Though the inverse case is\notherwise stable, the presence of the particles results in a fingering\ninstability at low capillary number. This capillary-driven instability is\ndriven-by the integration of particles into the interface which results from\nthe minimization of the interfacial energy. Both axisymmetric and rectangular\ngeometries are considered in order to quantify this phenomenon.\n", "  The production of charged pions, kaons and (anti)protons has been measured at\nmid-rapidity ($-0.5 < y < 0$) in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=5.02$\nTeV using the ALICE detector at the LHC. Exploiting particle identification\ncapabilities at high transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$), the previously\npublished $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra have been extended to include measurements up to\n20 GeV/$c$ for seven event multiplicity classes. The $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra for pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, needed to interpolate a pp reference spectrum,\nhave also been extended up to 20 GeV/$c$ to measure the nuclear modification\nfactor ($R_{\\rm pPb}$) in non-single diffractive p-Pb collisions. At\nintermediate transverse momentum ($2 < p_{\\rm T} < 10$\\,GeV/$c$) the\nproton-to-pion ratio increases with multiplicity in p-Pb collisions, a similar\neffect is not present in the kaon-to-pion ratio. The $p_{\\rm T}$ dependent\nstructure of such increase is qualitatively similar to those observed in pp and\nheavy-ion collisions. At high $p_{\\rm T}$ ($>10$ GeV/$c$), the particle ratios\nare consistent with those reported for pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC\nenergies. At intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ the (anti)proton $R_{\\rm pPb}$ shows a\nCronin-like enhancement, while pions and kaons show little or no nuclear\nmodification. At high $p_{\\rm T}$ the charged pion, kaon and (anti)proton\n$R_{\\rm pPb}$ are consistent with unity within statistical and systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  Motivated by the empirical finding that the known hemispheric rules for the\ncurrent helicity at the solar surface are not strict, the excitation of\nsmall-scale current helicity by the influence of a large-scale helical magnetic\nbackground fields on nonrotating magnetoconvection is demonstrated. It is shown\nwithin a quasilinear analytic theory of driven turbulence and by nonlinear\nsimulations of magnetoconvection that the resulting small-scale current\nhelicity has the same sign as the large-scale current helicity while the ratio\nof both pseudo-scalars is of the order of the magnetic Reynolds number of the\nconvection. The same models do not provide finite values of the small-scale\nkinetic helicity. On the other hand, a turbulence-induced electromotive force\nis produced including the diamagnetic pumping term as well as the eddy\ndiffusivity but no alpha effect. It is thus argued that the relations by\nPouquet & Patterson (1978) and Keinigs (1983) for the simultaneous existence of\nsmall-scale current helicity and alpha effect do not hold for the considered\nmodel of nonrotating magnetoconvection. Calculations for various values of the\nmagnetic Prandtl number demonstrate that for the considered diffusivities the\ncurrent helicity grows for growing magnetic Reynolds number which is not true\nfor the velocity of the diamagnetic pumping -- in agreement with the results of\nthe quasilinear analytical approximation.\n", "  We generate in-plane magnetoelastic waves in nickel films using the\nall-optical transient grating technique. When performed on amorphous glass\nsubstrates, two dominant magnetoelastic excitations can be resonantly driven by\nthe underlying elastic distortions, the Rayleigh Surface Acoustic Wave and the\nSurface Skimming Longitudinal Wave. An applied field, oriented in the sample\nplane, selectively tunes the coupling between magnetic precession and one of\nthe elastic waves, thus demonstrating selective excitation of coexisting, large\namplitude magnetoelastic waves. Analytical calculations based on the Green's\nfunction approach corroborate the generation of the non-equilibrium surface\nacoustic transients.\n", "  One major purpose of studying the single-site scattering problem is to obtain\nthe scattering matrices and differential equation solutions indispensable to\nmultiple scattering theory (MST) calculations. On the other hand, the\nsingle-site scattering itself is also appealing because it reveals the physical\nenvironment experienced by electrons around the scattering center. In this\npaper we demonstrate a new formalism to calculate the relativistic\nfull-potential single-site Green's function. We implement this method to\ncalculate the single-site density of states and electron charge densities. The\ncode is rigorously tested and with the help of Krein's theorem, the\nrelativistic effects and full potential effects in group V elements and noble\nmetals are thoroughly investigated.\n", "  Ionization of atoms and molecules in strong laser fields is a fundamental\nprocess in many fields of research, especially in the emerging field of\nattosecond science. So far, demonstrably accurate data have only been acquired\nfor atomic hydrogen (H), a species that is accessible to few investigators.\nHere we present measurements of the ionization yield for argon, krypton, and\nxenon with percentlevel accuracy, calibrated using H, in a laser regime widely\nused in attosecond science. We derive a transferrable calibration standard for\nlaser peak intensity, accurate to 1.3%, that is based on a simple reference\ncurve. In addition, our measurements provide a much-needed benchmark for\ntesting models of ionisation in noble-gas atoms, such as the widely employed\nsingle-active electron approximation.\n", "  Assuming the form $\\sigma^{\\gamma P} \\propto l^{\\lambda_{\\rm eff}}$ at fixed\n$Q^2$ for the behavior of the virtual-photon proton scattering cross section,\nwhere $l$ is the coherence length of the photon fluctuations, it is seen that\nthe extrapolated values of $\\sigma^{\\gamma P}$ for different $Q^2$ cross for\n$l\\approx 10^8$~fm. It is argued that this behavior is not physical, and that\nthe behavior of the cross sections must change before this coherence length $l$\nis reached. This could set the scale for the onset of saturation of parton\ndensities.\n", "  We study the resonance interaction between two uniformly accelerated\nidentical atoms, one excited and the other in the ground state, prepared in a\ncorrelated (symmetric or antisymmetric) state and interacting with the scalar\nfield or the electromagnetic field in the vacuum state. In this case (resonance\ninteraction), the interatomic interaction is a second-order effect in the\natom-field coupling. We separate the contributions of vacuum fluctuations and\nradiation reaction to the resonance energy shift of the system, and show that\nonly radiation reaction contributes, while Unruh thermal fluctuations do not\naffect the resonance interaction. We also find that beyond a characteristic\nlength scale related to the atomic acceleration, non-thermal effects in the\nradiation reaction contribution change the distance-dependence of the resonance\ninteraction. Finally, we find that previously unidentified features appear,\ncompared with the scalar field case, when the interaction with the\nelectromagnetic field is considered, as a consequence of the peculiar nature of\nthe vacuum quantum noise of the electromagnetic field in a relativistically\naccelerated background.\n", "  The purposes of this paper are testing an efficiency algorithm based on LBM\nand using it to analyze two-dimensional natural convection with low Prandtl\nnumber. Steady state or oscillatory results are obtained using double\nmultiple-relaxation-time thermal lattice Boltzmann method. The velocity and\ntemperature fields are solved using D2Q9 and D2Q5 models, respectively. With\ndifferent Rayleigh number, the tested natural convection can either achieve to\nsteady state or oscillatory. With fixed Rayleigh number, lower Prandtl number\nleads to a weaker convection effect, longer oscillation period and higher\noscillation amplitude for the cases reaching oscillatory solutions. At fixed\nPrandtl number, higher Rayleigh number leads to a more notable convection\neffect and longer oscillation period. Double multiple-relaxation-time thermal\nlattice Boltzmann method is applied to simulate the low Prandtl number fluid\nnatural convection. Rayleigh number and Prandtl number effects are also\ninvestigated when the natural convection results oscillate.\n", "  Self-assembly of sub-micron particles suspended in a water film is\ninvestigated numerically. The liquid medium is allowed to evaporate leaving\nonly the sub-micron particles. A coupled CFD-DEM approach is used for the\nsimulation of fluid-particle interaction. Momentum exchange and heat transfer\nbetween particles and fluid and among particles are considered. A history\ndependent contact model is used to compute the contact force among sub-micron\nparticles. Simulation is done using the open source software package CFDEM\nwhich basically comprises of two other open source packages OpenFOAM and\nLIGGGHTS. OpenFOAM is a widely used solver for CFD related problems. LIGGGHTS,\na modification of LAMMPS, is used for DEM simulation of granular materials. The\nfinal packing structure of the sub-micron particles is discussed in terms of\ndistribution of coordination number and radial distribution function (RDF). The\nfinal packing structure shows that particles form clusters and exhibit a\ndefinite pattern as water evaporates away.\n", "  We experimentally generate and characterize the eigenstates of the\nWigner-Smith time-delay matrix, called principal modes, in a multimode fiber\nwith strong mode coupling. The unique spectral and temporal properties of\nprincipal modes enable a global control of the temporal dynamics of optical\npulses transmitted through the fiber, despite random mode mixing. Our analysis\nreveals that the well-defined delay time of the eigenstates are formed by\nmulti-path interference, which can be effectively manipulated by the spatial\ndegrees of freedom of the input wavefront. This study is essential to\ncontrolling the dynamics of wave scattering, paving the way for coherent\ncontrol of pulse propagation through complex media.\n", "  The resolvent operator plays a central role in matrix models. For instance,\nwith utilizing the loop equation, all of the perturbative amplitudes including\ncorrelators, the free-energy and those of instanton corrections can be obtained\nfrom the spectral curve of the resolvent operator. However, at the level of\nnon-perturbative completion, the resolvent operator is generally not sufficient\nto recover all the information from the loop equations. Therefore it is\nnecessary to find a sufficient set of operators which provide the missing\nnon-perturbative information. In this paper, we study generalized Wronskians of\nthe Baker-Akhiezer systems as a manifestation of these new degrees of freedom.\nIn particular, we derive their isomonodromy systems and then extend several\nspectral dualities to these systems. In addition, we discuss how these\nWronskian operators are naturally aligned on the Kac table. Since they are\nconsistent with the Seiberg-Shih relation, we propose that these new degrees of\nfreedom can be identified as FZZT-Cardy branes in Liouville theory. This means\nthat FZZT-Cardy branes are the bound states of elemental FZZT branes (i.e. the\ntwisted fermions) rather than the bound states of principal FZZT-brane (i.e.\nthe resolvent operator).\n", "  Single photon detection is a requisite technique in quantum-optics\nexperiments in both the optical and the microwave domains. However, the energy\nof microwave quanta are four to five orders of magnitude less than their\noptical counterpart, making the efficient detection of single microwave photons\nextremely challenging. Here, we demonstrate the detection of a single microwave\nphoton propagating through a waveguide. The detector is implemented with an\n\"impedance-matched\" artificial $\\Lambda$ system comprising the dressed states\nof a driven superconducting qubit coupled to a microwave resonator. We attain a\nsingle-photon detection efficiency of $0.66 \\pm 0.06$ with a reset time of\n$\\sim 400$~ns. This detector can be exploited for various applications in\nquantum sensing, quantum communication and quantum information processing.\n", "  An external electric field changes the physical properties of polar-liquids\ndue to the reorientation of their permanent dipoles. For example it should\naffect significantly the physical properties of water confined in a\nnanochannel. The latter effect is profoundly enhanced, if the field is applied\nalong the nanochannel. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we predict that an\nin-plane electric field applied parallel to the channel polarizes water\nmolecules which are confined between two graphene layers, resulting in\ndistinct-ferroelectricity and electrical hysteresis. We found that electric\nfields alter the in-plane order of the hydrogen bonds: reversing the electric\nfield does not restore the system to the non-polar initial state, instead a\nresidual dipole moment remains in the system. Our study provides insights into\nthe ferroelectric state of water when confined in nanochannels and shows how\nthis can be tuned by an electric field.\n", "  Significant transient beam loading effects were observed during beam\ncommissioning tests of prototype II of the injector for the Accelerator Driven\nSub-critical (ADS) system, which took place at the Institute of Modern Physics,\nChinese Academy of Sciences, between October and December 2014. During these\ntests experiments were performed with CW operation of the cavities with pulsed\nbeam current, and the system was configured to make use of a prototype digital\nlow level radio frequency (LLRF) controller. The system was originally operated\nin pulsed mode with a simple PID feedback control algorithm, which was not able\nto maintain the desired gradient regulation during pulsed 10 mA beam\noperations. A unique simple transient beam loading compensation method which\nmade use of a combination of PI feedback and feedforward control algorithm was\nimplemented in order to significantly reduce the beam induced transient effect\nin the cavity gradients. The superconducting cavity field variation was reduced\nto less than 1.7% after turning on this control algorithm. The design and\nexperimental results of this system are presented in this paper.\n", "  Frequent observation of a quantum system leads to quantum Zeno physics, where\nthe system evolution is constrained to states commensurate with the measurement\noutcome. We show that, more generally, the system can evolve between such\nstates through higher-order virtual processes that pass through states outside\nthe measurement subspace. We derive effective Hamiltonians to describe this\nevolution, and the dependence on the time between measurements. We demonstrate\napplication of this phenomena to prototypical quantum many-body system\nexamples, spin chains and atoms in optical lattices, where it facilitates\ncorrelated dynamical effects.\n", "  Simplified models provide a useful tool to conduct the search and exploration\nof physics beyond the Standard Model in a model-independent fashion. In this\nwork we consider the complementarity of indirect searches for new physics in\nHiggs couplings and distributions with direct searches for new particles, using\na simplified model which includes a new singlet scalar resonance and\nvector-like fermions that can mix with the SM top-quark. We fit this model to\nthe combined ATLAS and CMS 125 GeV Higgs production and coupling measurements\nand other precision electroweak constraints, and explore in detail the effects\nof the new matter content upon Higgs production and kinematics. We highlight\nsome novel features and decay modes of the top partner phenomenology, and\ndiscuss prospects for Run II.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the localization mechanism of the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in the presence of spin-flip disorders. We show\nthat the QAHE keeps quantized at weak disorders, then enters a Berry-curvature\nmediated metallic phase at moderate disorders, and finally goes into the\nAnderson insulating phase at strong disorders. From the phase diagram, we find\nthat at the charge neutrality point although the QAHE is most robust against\ndisorders, the corresponding metallic phase is much easier to be localized into\nthe Anderson insulating phase due to the \\textit{interchange} of Berry\ncurvatures carried respectively by the conduction and valence bands. At the\nend, we provide a phenomenological picture related to the topological charges\nto better understand the underlying physical origin of the QAHE Anderson\nlocalization.\n", "  Theory of superconductivity generated in one atomic layer thick two\ndimensional electron gas by a single flat band of high energy longitudinal\noptical phonons is considered. The polar dielectric $SrTiO_{3}$ (STO) exhibits\nsuch an energetic phonon mode and the 2DEG is created both when one unit cell\n$FeSe$ layer is grown on its $\\left( 100\\right) $ surface and on the interface\nwith another dielectric like $LaAlO_{3}$ (LAO). We obtain a quantitative\ndescription of both systems solving the gap equation for $T_{c}$ without making\nuse of approximations like the Kirzhnits Ansatz for arbitrary chemical\npotential $\\mu $, electron-phonon coupling $\\lambda $ and the phonon frequency\n$\\Omega $, and direct (RPA) electron-electron repulsion strength $\\alpha $. The\nhigh temperature superconductivity in 1UC$FeSe$/STO is possible due to a\ncombination of three factors: high LO phonon frequency, large electron-phonon\ncoupling $\\lambda \\sim 0.5$ and huge dielectric constant of the substrate\nsuppression the Coulomb repulsion. It is shown that very low density electron\ngas in the interfaces is still capable of generating superconductivity of the\norder of $0.1$ K in LAO/STO. Superconductivity persists even on the band edge\n$\\mu =0$.\n", "  We study heterotic supergravity on the conifold and its Z2 orbifold with\nAbelian gauge fields and three-form flux. At large distances, these solutions\nare locally Ricci-flat, have a magnetic flux through the two-sphere at infinity\nas well as non-zero five-brane charge. For a given flux, our family of\nsolutions has three real parameters, the size of the pair of two spheres in the\nIR and the dilaton zero mode. We present an explicit analytic solution for the\ndecoupled near horizon region where for a given flux, the size of the cycles is\nfrozen and the only parameter is the dilaton zero mode. We also present an\nexactly solvable worldsheet CFT for this near horizon region. When one of the\ntwo cycles has vanishing size, the near horizon region no longer exists but we\nobtain a solution on the (unorbifolded) resolved conifold.\n", "  Multi-filter images from the solar corona are used to obtain temperature maps\nwhich are analyzed using techniques based on proper orthogonal decomposition\n(POD) in order to extract dynamical and structural information at various\nscales. Exploring active regions before and after a solar flare and comparing\nthem with quiet regions we show that the multiscale behavior presents distinct\nstatistical properties for each case that can be used to characterize the level\nof activity in a region. Information about the nature of heat transport is also\nbe extracted from the analysis.\n", "  In finite dimensions, we provide characterizations of the quantum dynamical\nsemigroups that do not decrease the von Neumann, the Tsallis and the Renyi\nentropies, as well as a family of functions of density operators strictly\nrelated to the Schatten norms. A few remarkable consequences --- in particular,\na description of the associated infinitesimal generators --- are derived, and\nsome significant examples are discussed. Extensions of these results to\nsemigroups of trace-preserving positive (i.e., not necessarily completely\npositive) maps and to a more general class of quantum entropies are also\nconsidered.\n", "  X-ray reverberation lags have recently been discovered in both active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and black hole X-ray binaries. A recent study of the\nneutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1608-52 has also shown significant lags,\nwhose properties hint at a reverberation origin. Here, we adapt general\nrelativistic ray tracing impulse response functions used to model X-ray\nreverberation in AGN for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. Assuming\nrelativistic reflection forms the broad iron line and associated reflection\ncontinuum, we use reflection fits to the energy spectrum along with the impulse\nresponse functions to calculate the expected lags as a function of energy over\nthe range of observed kHz QPO frequencies in 4U 1608-52. We find that the lag\nenergy spectrum is expected to increase with increasing energy above 8 keV,\nwhile the observed lags in 4U 1608-52 show the opposite behavior. This\ndemonstrates that the lags in the lower kHz QPO of 4U 1608-52 are not solely\ndue to reverberation. We do note, however, that the models appear to be more\nconsistent with the much flatter lag energy spectrum observed in the upper kHz\nQPO of several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, suggesting that lower and\nupper kHz QPOs may have different origins.\n", "  Motivated by the recent indications for a 750 GeV resonance in the di-photon\nfinal state at the LHC, in this work we analyse the compatibility of the excess\nwith the broad photon excess detected at the Galactic Centre. Intriguingly, by\nanalysing the parameter space of an effective models where a 750 GeV\npseudoscalar particles mediates the interaction between the Standard Model and\na scalar dark sector, we prove the compatibility of the two signals. We show,\nhowever, that the LHC mono-jet searches and the Fermi LAT measurements strongly\nlimit the viable parameter space. We comment on the possible impact of cosmic\nantiproton flux measurement by the AMS-02 experiment.\n", "  We demonstrate that dark matter particles gravitationally bound to the Earth\ncan induce a characteristic nuclear recoil signal at low energies in direct\ndetection experiments. The new spectral feature we predict can provide the\nultimate smoking gun for dark matter discovery for experiments with positive\nsignal but unclear background. The new feature is universal, in that the ratio\nof bound over halo dark matter event rates at detectors is independent of the\ndark matter-nucleon cross section.\n", "  Obtaining pressure field data from particle image velocimetry (PIV) is an\nattractive technique in fluid dynamics due to its noninvasive nature. The\napplication of this technique generally involves integrating the pressure\ngradient or solving the pressure Poisson equation using a velocity field\nmeasured with PIV. However, very little research has been done to investigate\nthe dynamics of error propagation from PIV-based velocity measurements to the\npressure field calculation. Rather than measure the error through experiment,\nwe investigate the dynamics of the error propagation by examining the Poisson\nequation directly. We analytically quantify the error bound in the pressure\nfield, and are able to illustrate the mathematical roots of why and how the\nPoisson equation based pressure calculation propagates error from the PIV data.\nThe results show that the error depends on the shape and type of boundary\nconditions, the dimensions of the flow domain, and the flow type.\n", "  A model for a spin-torque nano-oscillator based on the self-sustained\noscillation of a magnetic skyrmion is presented. The system involves a circular\nnanopillar geometry comprising an ultrathin film free magnetic layer with a\nstrong Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction and a polariser layer with a\nvortex-like spin configuration. It is shown that spin-transfer torques due to\ncurrent flow perpendicular to the film plane leads to skyrmion gyration that\narises from a competition between geometric confinement due to boundary edges\nand the vortex-like polarisation of the spin torques. A phenomenology for such\noscillations is developed and quantitative analysis using micromagnetics\nsimulations is presented. It is also shown that weak disorder due to random\nanisotropy variations does not influence the main characteristics of the\nsteady-state gyration.\n", "  In this article we conjecture a relationship between 5d SCFT's, that can be\nengineered by 5-brane webs in the presence of an $O5^-$-plane, and 4d class S\ntheories of type D. The specific relation is that compactification on a circle\nof the former leads to the latter. We present evidence for this conjecture. One\npiece of evidence, which is also an interesting application of this, is that it\nsuggests identifications between different class S theories. This can in turn\nbe tested by comparing their central charges.\n", "  This research presents one possible way for imminent prediction of earthquake\nmagnitude, depth and epicenter coordinates by solving the inverse problem using\na data acquisition network system for monitoring, archiving and complex\nanalysis of geophysical variables precursors. Among many possible precursors\nthe most reliable are the geoelectromagnetic field, the boreholes water level,\nthe radon surface concentration, the local heat flow, the ionosphere variables,\nthe low frequency atmosphere and Earth core waves. In this study only\ngeomagnetic data are used. Within the framework of geomagnetic quake approach\nit is possible to perform an imminent regional seismic activity forecasting on\nthe basis of simple analysis of geomagnetic data which use a new variable Schtm\nwith dimension surface density of energy. Such analysis of Memambetsu, Kakioka,\nKanoya (Japan, INTERMAGNET) stations and NEIC earthquakes data, the hypothesis\nthat the predicted earthquake is this with bigest value of the variable Schtm\npermit to formulate an inverse problem (overdetermined algebraic system) for\nprecursors signals like a functions of earthquake magnitude, depth and distance\nfrom a monitoring point. Thus, in the case of data acquisition network system\nexistence, which includes monitoring of more than one reliable precursor\nvariables in at least four points distributed within the area with a radius of\nup to 700 km, there will be enough algebraic equations for calculation of\nimpending earthquake magnitude, depth and distance, solving the overdetermined\nalgebraic system.\n", "  Breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in supercooled liquids is believed to\nbe one of the hallmarks of glass transition. The phenomena is studied in depth\nover many years to understand the microscopic mechanism without much success.\nRecently it was found that violation of Stokes-Einstein relation in supercooled\nliquids can be tuned very systematically by pinning randomly a set of particles\nin their equilibrium positions. This observation suggested a possible framework\nwhere breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in the dynamics of supercooled\nliquids can be studied with precise control. We have done extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations to understand this phenomena by analyzing the structure of\nappropriately defined set of dynamically slow and fast particles clusters. We\nhave shown that the Stokes-Einstein breakdown actually become predominant once\nthe cluster formed by the slow particles percolate the entire system size.\nFinally we proposed a possible close connection between fractal dimensions of\nthese clusters and the exponents associated with the fractional Stokes-Einstein\nrelation.\n", "  We perform the one-loop induced charged lepton flavor violating decays of the\nneutral Higgses in an extended mirror fermion model with non-sterile\nelectroweak-scale right-handed neutrinos and a horizontal $A_4$ symmetry in the\nlepton sector. We demonstrate that for the 125 GeV scalar $h$ there is tension\nbetween the recent LHC result ${\\cal B}(h \\to \\tau \\mu) \\sim $ 1% and the\nstringent limits on the rare processes $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ and $\\tau \\to (\\mu$\nor $e) \\gamma$ from low energy experiments.\n", "  This paper presents a new approach, so-called boundary variation diminishing\n(BVD), for reconstructions that minimize the discontinuities (jumps) at cell\ninterfaces in Godunov type schemes. It is motivated by the observation that\ndiminishing the jump at the cell boundary might effectively reduce the\ndissipation in numerical flux. Different from the existing practices which seek\nhigh-order polynomials within mesh cells while assuming discontinuities being\nalways at the cell interfaces, we proposed a new strategy that combines a\nhigh-order polynomial-based interpolation and a jump-like reconstruction that\nallows a discontinuity being partly represented within the mesh cell rather\nthan at the interface. It is shown that new schemes of high fidelity for both\ncontinuous and discontinuous solutions can be devised by the BVD guideline with\nproperly-chosen candidate reconstruction schemes. Excellent numerical results\nhave been obtained for both scalar and Euler conservation laws with\nsubstantially improved solution quality in comparison with the existing\nmethods. This work provides a simple and accurate alternative of great\npractical significance to the current Godunov paradigm which overly pursues the\nsmoothness within mesh cell under the questionable premiss that discontinuities\nonly appear at cell interfaces.\n", "  By investigating the crystalline structure of ground-state orthorhombic\nSrRuO$_3$, we present a benchmark study of some of the most popular density\nfunctional theory (DFT) approaches from the local density approximation (LDA),\ngeneralized-gradient approximation (GGA), and hybrid functional families.\nRecent experimental success in stabilizing tetragonal and monoclinic phases of\nSrRuO$_3$ at room temperature sheds a new light on the ability to accurately\ndescribe geometry of this material by applying first-principles calculations.\nTherefore, our work is aimed to analyse the performance of different DFT\nfunctionals and provide some recommendations for future research of SrRuO$_3$.\nA comparison of the obtained results to the low-temperature experimental data\nindicates that revised GGAs for solids are the best choice for the lattice\nconstants and volume due to their nice accuracy and low computational cost.\nHowever, when tilting and rotation angles appear on the scene, a combination of\nthe revised GGAs with the hybrid scheme becomes the most preferable option. It\nis important to note that a worse performance of LDA functional is somewhat\ncompensated by its realistic reproduction of electronic and magnetic structure\nof SrRuO$_3$, making it a strong competitor if the physical features are also\ntaken into account.\n", "  The five dimensional AGT correspondence implies the connection between the\nq-deformed Virasoro block and the 5d Nekrasov partition function. In this\npaper, we determine a q-deformation of the four-point block in the Coulomb gas\nrepresentation from the 5d Nekrasov function, and obtain an expression of the\nq-deformed vertex operator. If we use only one kind of the q-vertex operators,\none of the insertion points of them must be modified in order to hold the 2d/5d\ncorrespondence.\n", "  To each hyperbolic Landau level of the Poincar\\'e disc is attached a\ngeneralized negative binomial distribution. In this paper, we compute the\nmoment generating function of this distribution and supply its decomposition as\na perturbation of the negative binomial distribution by a finitely-supported\nmeasure. Using the Mandel parameter, we also discuss the nonclassical nature of\nthe associated coherent states. Next, we determine the L\\'evy-Kintchine\ndecomposition its characteristic function when the latter does not vanish and\ndeduce that it is quasi-infinitely divisible except for the lowest hyperbolic\nLandau level corresponding to the negative binomial distribution. By\nconsidering the total variation of the obtained quasi-L\\'evy measure, we\nintroduce a new infinitely-divisible distribution for which we derive the\ncharacteristic function.\n", "  We study a set of exclusive decay modes of the Standard Model Higgs boson\ninto a vector meson and a dilepton pair: $h\\to V \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, with\n$V=\\Upsilon, J/\\psi,\\phi$, and $\\ell=\\mu, \\tau$, determining the decay rates,\nthe dilepton mass spectra and the $V$ longitudinal helicity fraction\ndistributions. In the same framework, we analyze the exclusive modes into\nneutrino pairs $h\\to V \\nu \\bar \\nu$. We also discuss the implications of the\nrecent CMS and ATLAS results for the lepton flavor-changing process $h\\to\n\\tau^+ \\mu^-$ on the $h\\to V \\tau^+ \\mu^-$ decay modes.\n", "  We study far-from-equilibrium physics of strongly interacting plasmas at\ncriticality and zero charge density for a wide range of dynamical scaling\nexponents z in d dimensions using holographic methods. In particular, we\nconsider homogeneous isotropization of asymptotically Lifshitz black branes\nwith full backreaction. We find stable evolution and equilibration times that\nexhibit small dependence of z and are of the order of the inverse temperature.\nPerforming a quasinormal mode analysis we find a corresponding narrow range of\nrelaxation times, fully characterized by the fraction z/(d-1). For z>=d-1,\nequilibration is overdamped, whereas for z<d-1 we find oscillatory behavior.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to construct regular Hayward thin-shell wormholes\nand analyze their stability. We adopt Israel formalism to calculate surface\nstresses of the shell and check the null and weak energy conditions for the\nconstructed wormholes. It is found that the stress-energy tensor components\nviolate the null and weak energy conditions leading to the presence of exotic\nmatter at the throat. We analyze the attractive and repulsive characteristics\nof wormholes corresponding to $a^r>0$ and $a^r<0$, respectively. We also\nexplore stability conditions for the existence of traversable thin-shell\nwormholes with arbitrarily small amount of fluids describing cosmic expansion.\nWe find that the spacetime has non-physical regions which give rise to event\nhorizon for $0<a_{0}<2.8$ and the wormhole becomes non-traversable producing a\nblack hole. The non-physical region in the wormhole configuration decreases\ngradually and vanishes for the Hayward parameter $l=0.9$. It is concluded that\nthe Hayward and Van der Waals quintessence parameters increase the stability of\nthin-shell wormholes.\n", "  Efficient thermoelectric materials should present large Seebeck coefficient,\nhigh electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity. An enhanced Seebeck\ncoefficient can be obtained from materials where the Fermi level can be aligned\nwith a large and narrow peak of the density of states, particularly when a\nsubstantial band valley degeneracy occurs. A high electrical conductivity comes\nas a consequence of large conductive hopping paths between the atoms of the\nmaterial. Both physical quantities can be decoupled and optimized independently\nif their origins can be ascribed to different sets of bands. Based on these\nassumptions, double perovskites A$_2$BB'O$_6$ with $d^0/d^6$ filling for the B\nand B' metal cations, respectively, have been considered. They provide a\ndesirable band structure with degenerate B-$t_{2g}$ / B'-$e_g$ bands above the\nFermi level together with a low thermal conductivity. We have carried out\nfirst-principles simulations for various of these nonmagnetic double\nperovskites and showed that all of them present a large Seebeck coefficient\n(consequence of the localized and empty $t_{2g}$ states of the B-cation), and\nlarge electrical conductivity due to the more spread unoccupied $e_{g}$ band of\nthe B' cation. We have seen that if they can be optimally doped, they could\nshow a figure of merit comparable or even higher than the best $n$-type\nthermoelectric oxides, such as SrTiO$_{3}$. Different mechanisms to tune the\nband structure and enhance the thermoelectric figure of merit are explored,\nincluding epitaxial strain, hydrostatic pressure, chemical pressure, and\nexternal doping. A fully relaxed structure has also been studied, showing that\na realistic calculation is necessary to make accurate predictions, but also\nproving that the main trends shown throughout the paper remain unchanged.\n", "  A conservative constraint on the Einstein Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP)\ncan be obtained under the assumption that the observed time delay between\ncorrelated particles from astronomical sources is dominated by the\ngravitational fields through which they move. Current limits on the WEP are\nmainly based on the observed time delays of photons with different energies. It\nis highly desirable to develop more accurate tests that include the\ngravitational wave (GW) sector. The detection by the advanced LIGO/VIRGO\nsystems of gravitational waves will provide attractive candidates for\nconstraining the WEP, extending the tests to gravitational interactions, with\npotentially higher accuracy. Considering the capabilities of the advanced\nLIGO/VIRGO network and the source direction uncertainty, we show that the joint\ndetection of GWs and electromagnetic signals could probe the WEP to an accuracy\ndown to $10^{-10}$, which is one order of magnitude tighter than previous\nlimits, and seven orders of magnitude tighter than the multi-messenger (photons\nand neutrinos) results by supernova 1987A.\n", "  In the context of three-dimensional conformal higher spin theory we derive,\nin the frame field formulation, the full non-linear spin 3 Cotton equation\ncoupled to spin 2. This is done by solving the corresponding Chern-Simons gauge\ntheory system of equations, that is, using $F=0$ to eliminate all auxiliary\nfields and thus expressing the Cotton equation in terms of just the spin 3\nframe field and spin 2 covariant derivatives and tensors (Schouten). In this\nderivation we neglect the spin 4 and higher spin sectors and approximate the\nstar product commutator by a Poisson bracket. The resulting spin 3 Cotton\nequation is complicated but can be related to linearized versions in the metric\nformulation obtained previously by other authors. The expected symmetry (spin 3\n\"translation\", \"Lorentz\" and \"dilatation\") properties are verified for Cotton\nand other relevant tensors but some perhaps unexpected features emerge in the\nprocess, in particular in relation to the non-linear equations. We discuss the\nstructure of this non-linear spin 3 Cotton equation but its explicit form is\nonly presented here, in an exact but not completely refined version, in\nappended files obtained by computer algebra methods. Both the frame field and\nmetric formulations are provided.\n", "  The twisted geometries of spin network states are described by simple\ntwistors, isomorphic to null twistors with a time-like direction singled out.\nThe isomorphism depends on the Immirzi parameter, and reduces to the identity\nwhen the parameter goes to infinity. Using this twistorial representation we\nstudy the action of the conformal group SU(2,2) on the classical phase space of\nloop quantum gravity, described by twisted geometry. The generators of\ntranslations and conformal boosts do not preserve the geometric structure,\nwhereas the dilatation generator does. It corresponds to a 1-parameter family\nof embeddings of T*SL(2,C) in twistor space, and its action preserves the\nintrinsic geometry while changing the extrinsic one - that is the boosts among\npolyhedra. We discuss the implication of this action from a dynamical point of\nview, and compare it with a discretisation of the dilatation generator of the\ncontinuum phase space, given by the Lie derivative of the group character. At\nleading order in the continuum limit, the latter reproduces the same\ntransformation of the extrinsic geometry, while also rescaling the areas and\nvolumes and preserving the angles associated with the intrinsic geometry. Away\nfrom the continuum limit its action has an interesting non-linear structure,\nbut is in general incompatible with the closure constraint needed for the\ngeometric interpretation. As a side result, we compute the precise relation\nbetween the extrinsic geometry used in twisted geometries and the one defined\nin the gauge-invariant parametrization by Dittrich and Ryan, and show that the\nsecondary simplicity constraints they posited coincide with those dynamically\nderived in the toy model of [1409.0836].\n", "  Until this day no electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) has been\nobserved. Why it is so vanishing small, escaping detection in the last 50\nyears, is not easy to explain. In general it is considered as the most\nsensitive probe for the violation of the combined symmetry of charge and parity\n(CP). A discovery could shed light on the poorly understood matter/anti-matter\nasymmetry of the universe. As nucleon it might one day help to distinguish\ndifferent sources of CP-violation in combination with measurements of the\nelectron and diamagnetic EDMs. This proceedings articles presents an overview\nof the most important concepts in searches for an nEDM and presents a brief\noverview of the world wide efforts.\n", "  We report the results from some of the deepest Keck/Multi-Object Spectrometer\nFor Infra-Red Exploration data yet obtained for candidate $z \\gtrsim 7$\ngalaxies. Our data show one significant line detection with 6.5$\\sigma$\nsignificance in our combined 10 hr of integration which is independently\ndetected on more than one night, thus ruling out the possibility that the\ndetection is spurious. The asymmetric line profile and non-detection in the\noptical bands strongly imply that the detected line is Ly$\\alpha$ emission from\na galaxy at $z$(Ly$\\alpha)=7.6637 \\pm 0.0011$, making it the fourth\nspectroscopically confirmed galaxy via Ly$\\alpha$ at $z>7.5$. This galaxy is\nbright in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV; $M_{\\rm UV} \\sim -21.2$) with a\nmoderately blue UV slope ($\\beta=-2.2^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$), and exhibits a\nrest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width of EW(Ly$\\alpha$) $\\sim\n15.6^{+5.9}_{-3.6}$ \\AA. The non-detection of the 11 other $z \\sim$ 7-8\ngalaxies in our long 10 hr integration, reaching a median 5$\\sigma$ sensitivity\nof 28 \\AA\\ in the rest-frame EW(Ly$\\alpha$), implies a 1.3$\\sigma$ deviation\nfrom the null hypothesis of a non-evolving distribution in the rest-frame\nEW(Ly$\\alpha$) between $3<z<6$ and $z=$ 7-8. Our results are consistent with\nprevious studies finding a decline in Ly$\\alpha$ emission at $z>6.5$, which may\nsignal the evolving neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium at the end of\nthe reionization epoch, although our weak evidence suggests the need for a\nlarger statistical sample to allow for a more robust conclusion.\n", "  We report three-dimensional particle mechanics static calculations that\npredict the microstructure evolution during die-compaction of elastic spherical\nparticles up to relative densities close to one. We employ a nonlocal contact\nformulation that remains predictive at high levels of confinement by removing\nthe classical assumption that contacts between particles are formulated locally\nas independent pair-interactions. The approach demonstrates that the\ncoordination number depends on the level of compressibility, i.e., on the\nPoisson's ratio, of the particles. Results also reveal that distributions of\ncontact forces between particles and between particles and walls, although\nsimilar at jamming onset, are very different at full compaction. Particle-wall\nforces are in remarkable agreement with experimental measurements reported in\nthe literature, providing a unifying framework for bridging experimental\nboundary observations with bulk behavior.\n", "  We introduce a new class of isolated three-dimensional skyrmion that can\noccur within the cone phase of chiral magnetic materials. These novel solitonic\nstates consist of an axisymmetric core separated from the host phase by an\nasymmetric shell. These skyrmions attract one another. We derive regular\nsolutions for isolated skyrmions arising in the cone phase of cubic helimagnets\nand investigate their bound states.\n", "  We introduce a two-orbital Hamiltonian on a square lattice that contains\non-site attractive interactions involving the two $e_g$ orbitals. Via a\ncanonical mean-field procedure similar to the one applied to the well-known\nnegative-$U$ Hubbard model, it is shown that the new model develops $d$-wave\n($B_{1g}$) superconductivity with nodes along the diagonal directions of the\nsquare Brillouin zone. This result is also supported by exact diagonalization\nof the model in a small cluster. The expectation is that this relatively simple\nattractive model could be used to address the properties of multiorbital\n$d$-wave superconductors in the same manner that the negative-$U$ Hubbard model\nis widely applied to the study of the properties of $s$-wave single-orbital\nsuperconductors. In particular, we show that by splitting the $e_g$ orbitals\nand working at three-quarters filling, such that the $x^2-y^2$ orbital\ndominates at the Fermi level but the $3z^2-r^2$ orbital contribution is\nnonzero, the $d$-wave pairing state found here phenomenologically reproduces\nseveral properties of the superconducting state of the high $T_c$ cuprates.\n", "  We report a combined study of in-plane resistivity and thermopower of the\npressure-induced heavy fermion superconductor CeAu2Si2 up to 27.8 GPa. It is\nfound that thermopower follows a scaling behavior in T/T* almost up to the\nmagnetic critical pressure pc ~ 22 GPa. By comparing with resistivity results,\nwe show that the magnitude and characteristic temperature dependence of\nthermopower in this pressure range are governed by the Kondo coupling and\ncrystal-field splitting, respectively. Below pc, the superconducting transition\nis preceded by a large negative thermopower minimum, suggesting a close\nrelationship between the two phenomena. Furthermore, thermopower of a variety\nof Ce-based Kondo-lattices with different crystal structures follows the same\nscaling relation up to T/T* ~ 2.\n", "  The topological classification of gerbes, as principal bundles with the\nstructure group the projective unitary group of a complex Hilbert space, over a\ntopological space $H$ is given by the third cohomology $\\text{H}^3(H, \\Bbb Z)$.\nWhen $H$ is a topological group the integral cohomology is often related to a\nlocally continuous (or in the case of a Lie group, locally smooth) third group\ncohomology of $H$. We shall study in more detail this relation in the case of a\ngroup extension $1\\to N \\to G \\to H \\to 1$ when the gerbe is defined by an\nabelian extension $1\\to A \\to \\hat N \\to N \\to 1$ of $N$. In particular, when\n$\\text{H}_s^1(N,A)$ vanishes we shall construct a transgression map\n$\\text{H}^2_s(N, A) \\to \\text{H}^3_s(H, A^N)$, where $A^N$ is the subgroup of\n$N$-invariants in $A$ and the subscript $s$ denotes the locally smooth\ncohomology. Examples of this relation appear in gauge theory which are\ndiscussed in the paper.\n", "  This paper provides a generalization of the realizability-preserving\ndiscontinuous-Galerkin scheme for quadrature-based minimum-entropy models to\nfull-moment models of arbitrary order. It is applied to the class of Kershaw\nclosures, which are able to provide a cheap closure of the moment problem. This\nresults in an efficient algorithm for the underlying linear transport equation.\nThe efficiency of high-order methods is demonstrated using numerical\nconvergence tests and non-smooth benchmark problems.\n", "  Elastic pion-nucleon scattering is analyzed in the framework of chiral\nperturbation theory up to fourth order within the heavy-baryon expansion and a\ncovariant approach based on an extended on-mass-shell renormalization scheme.\nWe discuss in detail the renormalization of the various low-energy constants\nand provide explicit expressions for the relevant $\\beta$-functions and the\nfinite subtractions of the power-counting breaking terms within the covariant\nformulation. To estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the truncation of the\nchiral expansion, we employ an approach which has been successfully applied in\nthe most recent analysis of the nuclear forces. This allows us to reliably\nextract the relevant low-energy constants from the available scattering data at\nlow energy. The obtained results provide a clear evidence that the breakdown\nscale of the chiral expansion for this reaction is related to the\n$\\Delta$-resonance. The explicit inclusion of the leading contributions of the\n$\\Delta$-isobar is demonstrated to substantially increase the range of\napplicability of the effective field theory. The resulting predictions for the\nphase shifts are in an excellent agreement with the ones from the recent\nRoy-Steiner-equation analysis of pion-nucleon scattering.\n", "  We study in great detail the possible existence of a Renyi-associated\nthermodynamics, with negative results. In particular, we uncover a hidden\nrelation in the Renyi's variational problem (MaxEnt). This relation connects\nthe two associated Lagrange multipliers (Canonical Ensemble) with the mean\nenergy $<U>$ and the Renyi parameter $\\alpha$. As a consequence of such\nrelation, we obtain anomalous Renyi-MaxEnt thermodynamic results.\n", "  Despite the realizations of spin-orbit (SO) coupling and synthetic gauge\nfields in optical lattices, the associated time-reversal symmetry breaking, and\n1D nature of the observed SO coupling pose challenges to obtain intrinsic $Z_2$\ntopological insulator. We propose here a model optical device for engineering\nintrinsic $Z_2$ topological insulator which can be easily set up with the\nexisting tools. The device is made of a periodic lattice of quantum\nmechanically connected atomic wires (dubbed SO wires) in which the laser\ngenerated SO coupling ($\\alpha_{\\bf k}$, with ${\\bf k}$ being the momentum) is\nreversed in every alternating wires as $\\pm\\alpha_{\\bf k}$. The associated\nsmall Zeeman terms are also automatically reversed in any two adjacent SO\nwires, which allow to effectively restore the global time-reversal (TR)\nsymmetry. Therefore, the two SO wires serve as the TR partner to each other\nwhich is an important ingredient for $Z_2$ topological insulators according to\nthe Kane-Mele model. These properties ensure a non-trivial $Z_2$ invariant\ntopological insulator phase with protected edge states. We also discuss that a\nnon-local current measurement can be used to detect the chiral edge states.\n", "  Compelling evidence for the existence of astrophysical neutrinos has been\nreported by the IceCube collaboration. Some features of the energy and\ndeclination distributions of IceCube events hint at a North/South asymmetry of\nthe neutrino flux. This could be due to the presence of the bulk of our Galaxy\nin the Southern hemisphere. The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located in the\nMediterranean Sea, has been taking data since 2007. It offers the best\nsensitivity to muon neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic ray interactions in\nthis region of the sky. In this letter a search for an extended neutrino flux\nfrom the Galactic Ridge region is presented. Different models of neutrino\nproduction by cosmic ray propagation are tested. No excess of events is\nobserved and upper limits for different neutrino flux spectral indices are set.\nThis constrains the number of IceCube events possibly originating from the\nGalactic Ridge. A simple power-law extrapolation of the Fermi-LAT flux to\nassociated IceCube High Energy Starting Events is excluded at 90% confidence\nlevel.\n", "  In this paper we study cosmological dynamics of phantom as well as\nnon-phantom fields with linear potential in presence of Galileon correction\n$(\\partial_\\mu\\phi \\partial^\\mu\\phi) \\Box \\phi$. We show that the Big Crunch\nsingularity is delayed compared to the standard case; the delay crucially\ndepends upon the strength of Galileon correction. As for the phantom Galileon,\n$\\rho_{\\phi}$ is shown to grow more slowly compared to the standard phantom\ndelaying the approach to singularity. In case, $V\\sim \\phi^n, n>4$, Big Rip is\nalso delayed, similar phenomenon is shown to take place for potentials steeper\nthan the exponential.\n", "  Coherent multidimensional optical spectroscopy techniques are broadly applied\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from NMR to the UV. These reveal\nproperties of matter through correlation plots of signal fields generated in\nresponse to sequences of short pulses with variable delays. Here we discuss a\nnew class of multidimensional techniques obtained by time-and-frequency\nresolved photon coincidence counting measurements of N photons which\nconstitutes a 2N dimensional spectrum. A compact description of these signals\nis developed based on time ordered superoperators rather than the normally\nordered ordinary operators used in Glauber's photon counting formalism.The\nindependent control of the time and frequency gate parameters reveals details\nof matter dynamics not available otherwise. Application to an anharmonic\noscillator model with fluctuating energy and anharmonicity demonstrates the\npower of these signals.\n", "  Optical diffraction tomography (ODT) is an interferometric microscopy\ntechnique capable of measuring 3-D refractive index (RI) distribution of\ntransparent samples. Multiple 2-D holograms of a sample illuminated with\nvarious angles are measured, from which 3-D RI map of the sample is\nreconstructed via the diffraction theory. ODT has been proved as a powerful\ntool for the study of biological cells, due to its non-invasiveness, label-free\nand quantitative imaging capability. Recently, our group has demonstrated that\na digital micromirror device (DMD) can be exploited for fast and precise\ncontrol of illumination beams for ODT. In this work, we systematically study\nthe precision and stability of the ODT system equipped with a DMD and present\nmeasurements of 3-D and 4-D RI maps of various types of live cells including\nhuman red blood cells, white blood cells, hepatocytes, and HeLa cells.\nFurthermore, we also demonstrate the effective visualization of 3-D RI maps of\nlive cells utilizing the measured information about the values and gradient of\nRI tomograms.\n", "  The effects on the local structure due to self-irradiation damage of Ga\nstabilized $\\delta$-Pu stored at cryogenic temperatures have been examined\nusing extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments. Extensive\ndamage, seen as a loss of local order, was evident after 72 days of storage\nbelow 15 K. The effect was observed from both the Pu and Ga sites, although\nless pronounced around Ga. Isochronal annealing was performed on this sample to\nstudy the annealing processes that occur between cryogenic and room temperature\nstorage conditions, where damage is mostly reversed. Damage fractions at\nvarious points along the annealing curve have been determined using an\namplitude-ratio method, standard EXAFS fitting, and a spherical crystallite\nmodel, and provide information complementary to previous electrical\nresistivity- and susceptibility-based isochronal annealing studies. The use of\na spherical crystallite model accounts for the changes in EXAFS spectra using\njust two parameters, namely, the crystalline fraction and the particle radius.\nTogether, these results are discussed in terms of changes to the local\nstructure around Ga and Pu throughout the annealing process and highlight the\nunusual role of Ga in the behavior of the lowest temperature anneals.\n", "  We study gauge coupling unification in supersymmetric $E_6$ models where an\nadditional $\\mathrm{U}(1)'$ gauge symmetry is broken near the TeV scale and a\nnumber of exotic matter fields from the $\\bm{27}$ representations have\n$O(\\mathrm{TeV})$ mass. Solving the 2-loop renormalization group equations of\ngauge couplings and a kinetic mixing coupling between the $\\mathrm{U}(1)'$ and\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ gauge fields, we find that the gauge couplings fall into the\nnon-perturbative regime below the GUT scale. We examine threshold corrections\non the running of gauge couplings from both light and heavy ($\\sim$ GUT scale)\nparticles and show constraints on the size of corrections to achieve the\nperturbative unification of gauge couplings.\n", "  We analyze the early growth stage of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) with\n$\\sim 10^{5} \\ \\rm M_\\odot$, which are formed by collapse of supermassive stars\nin atomic-cooling halos at $z \\gtrsim 10$. A nuclear accretion disk around a\nnewborn DCBH is gravitationally unstable and fragments into clumps with a few\n$10 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ at $\\sim 0.01-0.1 \\ \\rm pc$ from the center. Such clumps\nevolve into massive population III stars with a few $10-100 \\ \\rm M_\\odot$ via\nsuccessive gas accretion and a nuclear star cluster is formed. Radiative and\nmechanical feedback from an inner slim disk and the star cluster will\nsignificantly reduce the gas accretion rate onto the DCBH within $\\sim 10^6 \\\n\\rm yr$. Some of the nuclear stars can be scattered onto the loss cone orbits\nalso within $\\lesssim 10^6 \\ \\rm yr$ and tidally disrupted by the central DCBH.\nThe jet luminosity powered by such tidal disruption events can be $L_{\\rm j}\n\\gtrsim 10^{50} \\ \\rm erg \\ s^{-1}$. The prompt emission will be observed in\nX-ray bands with a peak duration of $\\delta t_{\\rm obs} \\sim 10^{5-6} \\ (1+z) \\\n\\rm s$ followed by a tail $\\propto t_{\\rm obs}^{-5/3}$, which can be detectable\nby Swift BAT and eROSITA even from $z \\sim 20$. Follow-up observations of the\nradio afterglows with, e.g., eVLA and the host halos with JWST could probe the\nearliest AGN feedback from DCBHs.\n", "  Loop quantum gravity is a mature theory. To proceed to explicit calculations\nin cosmology, it is necessary to make assumptions and simplifications based on\nthe symmetries of the cosmological setting. Symmetry reduction is especially\ncritical when dealing with cosmological perturbations. The present article\nreviews several approaches to the problem of building a consistent formalism\nthat describes the dynamics of perturbations on a quantum spacetime and tries\nto address their respective strengths and weaknesses. We also review the main\nopen issues in loop quantum cosmology.\n", "  We study the modeling and prediction of dynamical systems based on\nconventional models derived from measurements. Such algorithms are highly\ndesirable in situations where the underlying dynamics are hard to model from\nphysical principles or simplified models need to be found. We focus on symbolic\nregression methods as a part of machine learning. These algorithms are capable\nof learning an analytically tractable model from data, a highly valuable\nproperty. Symbolic regression methods can be considered as generalized\nregression methods. We investigate two particular algorithms, the so-called\nfast function extraction which is a generalized linear regression algorithm,\nand genetic programming which is a very general method. Both are able to\ncombine functions in a certain way such that a good model for the prediction of\nthe temporal evolution of a dynamical system can be identified. We illustrate\nthe algorithms by finding a prediction for the evolution of a harmonic\noscillator based on measurements, by detecting an arriving front in an\nexcitable system, and as a real-world application, the prediction of solar\npower production based on energy production observations at a given site\ntogether with the weather forecast.\n", "  The observation of gravitational waves from the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914 may be used to constrain\nthe possibility of Lorentz violation in graviton propagation, and the\nobservation by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor of a transient source in\napparent coincidence may be used to constrain the difference between the\nvelocities of light and gravitational waves: $c_g - c_\\gamma < 10^{-17}$.\n", "  Relativistic jets are the most energetic manifestation of the active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) phenomenon. AGN jets are observed from the radio through\ngamma-rays and carry copious amounts of matter and energy from the sub-parsec\ncentral regions out to the kiloparsec and often megaparsec scale galaxy and\ncluster environs. While most spatially resolved jets are seen in the radio, an\nincreasing number have been discovered to emit in the optical/near-IR and/or\nX-ray bands. Here we discuss a spectacular example of this class, the 3C 111\njet, housed in one of the nearest, double-lobed FR II radio galaxies known. We\ndiscuss new, deep Chandra and HST observations that reveal both near-IR and\nX-ray emission from several components of the 3C 111 jet, as well as both the\nnorthern and southern hotspots. Important differences are seen between the\nmorphologies in the radio, X-ray and near-IR bands. The long (over 100 kpc on\neach side), straight nature of this jet makes it an excellent prototype for\nfuture, deep observations, as it is one of the longest such features seen in\nthe radio, near-IR/optical and X-ray bands. Several independent lines of\nevidence, including the X-ray and broadband spectral shape as well as the\nimplied velocity of the approaching hotspot, lead us to strongly disfavor the\nEC/CMB model and instead favor a two-component synchrotron model to explain the\nobserved X-ray emission for several jet components. Future observations with\nNuSTAR, HST, and Chandra will allow us to further constrain the emission\nmechanisms.\n", "  Laser Plasma Acceleration (LPA) [1] is an emerging concept enabling to\ngenerate electron beams with high energy, high peak current and small\ntransverse emittance within a very short distance. The use of LPA can be\napplied to the Free Electron Laser (FEL) [2] case in order to investigate\nwhether it is suitable for the light amplification in the undulator. However,\ncapturing and guiding of such beams to the undulator is very challenging,\nbecause of the large divergence and high energy spread of the electron beams at\nthe plasma exit, leading to large chromatic emittances. A specific beam\nmanipulation scheme was recently proposed for the COXINEL (Coherent X-ray\nsource inferred from electrons accelerated by laser) setup, which makes an\nadvantage from the intrinsically large chromatic emittance of such beams [3].\nThe electron beam transport is studied using two simulation codes: a SOLEIL\nin-house one and ASTRA [4]. The influence of the collective effects on the\nelectron beam performance is also examined.\n", "  We explore different skyrmion types in the lowest Landau level of graphene at\na filling factor $\\nu=\\pm 1$. In addition to the formation of spin and valley\npseudospin skyrmions, we show that another type of spin-valley entangled\nskyrmions can be stabilized in graphene due to an approximate SU(4) spin-valley\nsymmetry that is affected by sublattice symmetry-breaking terms. These\nskyrmions have a clear signature in spin-resolved density measurements on the\nlattice scale, and we discuss the expected patterns for the different skyrmion\ntypes.\n", "  We consider the carrier transport and plasmonic phenomena in the lateral\ncarbon nanotube (CNT) networks forming the device channel with asymmetric\nelectrodes. One electrode is the Ohmic contact to the CNT network and the\nanother contact is the Schottky contact. These structures can serve as\ndetectors of the terahertz (THz) radiation. We develop the device model for\nresponse of the lateral CNT networks which comprise a mixture of randomly\noriented semiconductor CNTs (s-CNTs) and quasi-metal CNTs (m-CNTs). The\nproposed model includes the concept of the two-dimensional plasmons in\nrelatively dense networks of randomly oriented CNTs (CNT \"felt\") and predicts\nthe detector responsivity spectral characteristics. The detection mechanism is\nthe rectification of the ac current due the nonlinearity of the Schottky\ncontact current-voltage characteristics under the conditions of a strong\nenhancement of the potential drop at this contact associated with the plasmon\nexcitation. We demonstrate that the excitation of the two-dimensional plasmons\nby incoming THz radiation the detector responsivity can induce sharp resonant\npeaks of the detector responsivity at the signal frequencies corresponding to\nthe plasmonic resonances. The detector responsivity depends on the fractions of\nthe s- and m-CNTs. The burning of the near-contact regions of the m-CNTs or\ndestruction of these CNTs leads to a marked increase in the responsivity in\nagreement with our experimental data. The resonant THz detectors with\nsufficiently dense lateral CNT networks can compete and surpass other THz\ndetectors using plasmonic effects at room temperatures.\n", "  Quantum Reduced Loop Gravity is a promising framework for linking Loop\nQuantum Gravity and the effective semiclassical dynamics of Loop Quantum\nCosmology. We review its basic achievements and its main perspectives,\noutlining how it provides a quantum description of the Universe in terms of a\ncuboidal graph which constitutes the proper framework for applying loop\ntechniques in a cosmological setting.\n", "  We analyze the electric power load in the Czech Republic (CR) which exhibits\na seasonality as well as other oscillations typical for European countries.\nMoreover, we detect 1/f noise property of electrical power load with extra\nadditional peaks that allows to separate it into a deterministic and stochastic\npart. We then focus on the analysis of the stochastic part using improved\nMulti-fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method (MFDFA) to investigate\npower load datasets with a minute resolution. Extracting the noise part of the\nsignal by using Fourier transform allows us to apply this method to obtain the\nfluctuation function and to estimate the generalized Hurst exponent together\nwith the correlated Hurst exponent, its improvement for the non-Gaussian\ndatasets. The results exhibit a strong presence of persistent behaviour and the\ndataset is characterized by a non-Gaussian skewed distribution. There are also\nindications for the presence of the probability distribution that has heavier\ntail than the Gaussian distribution.\n", "  Using ab initio calculations, unexpected structural instability was recently\nfound in the ground state of the U$_2$Mo compound. Instead of the unstable\n$I4/mmm$ structure, in this work the $P6/mmm$ ($\\# 191$) space group, usually\ncalled $\\Omega$-phase, is proposed as the fundamental state. Electronic and\nelastic properties are studied in this work in order to characterize the\nphysical properties of the new ground state. The stability of the\n$\\Omega$-phase is studied by means of its elastic constants calculation and\nphonon dispersion spectrum. Analysis of isotropic indices shows that the new\nphase is a ductile material with a minimal degree of anisotropy, suggesting\nthat U$_2$Mo in the $P6/mmm$ structure is an elastic isotropic material.\nAnalysis of charge density, density of electronic states (DOS) and the\ncharacter of the bands revealed a high level of hybridization between\n$d$-molybdenum electronic states and $d$- and $f$-uranium ones.\n", "  We investigate entirely electronic torsional vibrational modes in linear\ncumulene chains. The carbon nuclei of a cumulene are positioned along the\nprimary axis so they can participate only in transverse and longitudinal\nmotions. However, the interatomic electronic clouds behave as a torsion spring\nwith remarkable torsional stiffness. The collective dynamics of these clouds\ncan be described in terms of electronic vibrational quanta, which we name\ntorsitons. It is shown that the group velocity of the wavepacket of torsitons\nis much higher than the typical speed of sound, because of the small mass of\nparticipating electrons compared to the atomic mass. For the same reason the\nmaximum energy of the torsitons in cumulenes is as high as a few electronvolts,\nwhile the minimum possible energy is evaluated as a few hundred wavenumbers and\nthis minimum is associated with asymmetry of zero point atomic vibrations.\nMolecular systems for experimental evaluation of the predictions are proposed.\n", "  We describe the Sr optical lattice clock apparatus at NPL with particular\nemphasis on techniques used to increase reliability and minimise the human\nrequirement in its operation. Central to this is a clock-referenced transfer\ncavity scheme for the stabilisation of cooling and trapping lasers. We\nhighlight several measures to increase the reliability of the clock with a view\ntowards the realisation of an optical time-scale. The clock contributed 502\nhours of data over a 25 day period (84% uptime) in a recent measurement\ncampaign with several uninterrupted periods of more than 48 hours. An\ninstability of $2\\times10^{-17}$ was reached after $10^5$ s of averaging in an\ninterleaved self-comparison of the clock.\n", "  We estimate the sensitivity of a lander-based instrument for the passive\nradio detection of a subsurface ocean beneath the ice shell of Europa, expected\nto be between 3~km - 30~km thick, using Jupiter's decametric radiation. A\npassive technique was previously studied for an orbiter. Using passive\ndetection in a lander platform provides a point measurement with significant\nimprovements due to largely reduced losses from surface roughness effects,\nlonger integration times, and diminished dispersion due to ionospheric effects\nallowing operation at lower frequencies and a wider band. A passive sounder\non-board a lander provides a low resource instrument sensitive to subsurface\nocean at Europa up to depths of 6.9~km for high loss ice (16 dB/km two-way\nattenuation rate) and 69~km for pure ice (1.6 dB/km).\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates in ring traps, we\ninvestigate the topological properties of the phase of a one-dimensional Bose\nfield in the presence of both thermal and quantum fluctuations -- the latter\nones being tuned by the depth of an optical lattice applied along the ring. In\nthe regime of large filling of the lattice, quantum Monte Carlo simulations\ngive direct access to the full statistics of fluctuations of the Bose-field\nphase, and of its winding number $W$ along the ring. At zero temperature the\nwinding-number (or topological-sector) fluctuations are driven by quantum phase\nslips localized around a Josephson link between two lattice wells, and their {\nsusceptibility} is found to jump at the superfluid-Mott insulator transition.\nAt finite (but low) temperature, on the other hand, the winding number\nfluctuations are driven by thermal activation of nearly uniform phase twists,\nwhose activation rate is governed by the superfluid fraction. A\nquantum-to-thermal crossover in winding number fluctuations is therefore\nexhibited by the system, and it is characterized by a conformational change in\nthe topologically non-trivial configurations, from localized to uniform phase\ntwists, which can be experimentally observed in ultracold Bose gases via\nmatter-wave interference.\n", "  We consider a class of multi-qubit dephasing models that combine classical\nnoise sources and linear coupling to a bosonic environment, and are controlled\nby arbitrary sequences of dynamical decoupling pulses. Building on a general\ntransfer filter-function framework for open-loop control, we provide an exact\nrepresentation of the controlled dynamics for arbitrary stationary non-Gaussian\nclassical and quantum noise statistics, with analytical expressions emerging\nwhen all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exact characterization is used to\nestablish two main results. First, we construct multi-qubit sequences that\nensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time and frequency\ndomain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms\nof total pulse number. Next, we show how long-time multi-qubit storage may be\nachieved by meeting appropriate conditions for the emergence of a fidelity\nplateau under sequence repetition, thereby generalizing recent results for\nsingle-qubit memory under Gaussian dephasing. In both scenarios, the key step\nis to endow multi-qubit sequences with a suitable displacement anti-symmetry\nproperty, which is of independent interest for applications ranging from\nenvironment-assisted entanglement generation to multi-qubit noise spectroscopy\nprotocols.\n", "  We study by first-principles calculations a densely packed island of organic\nmolecules (F4TCNQ) adsorbed on graphene. We find that with electron doping the\nisland naturally forms a p-n junction in the graphene sheet. For example, a\ndoping level of ~ 3 * 10^{13} electrons per cm^2 results in a p-n junction with\n800 meV electrostatic potential barrier. Unlike in a conventional p-n junction\nin graphene, in the case of the junction formed by an adsorbed organic\nmolecular island we expect that the Klein tunneling is inhibited, even without\nan applied external magnetic field. Here Klein tunneling is inhibited by the\nferromagnetic order that spontaneously occurs in the molecular island upon\ndoping. We estimate that the magnetic barrier in the graphene sheet is around\n10 mT.\n", "  We report a test of the universality of free fall (UFF) by comparing the\ngravity acceleration of the $^{87}$Rb atoms in $m_F=+1$ versus that in\n$m_F=-1$, where the corresponding spin orientations are opposite. A\nMach-Zehnder-type atom interferometer is exploited to sequentially measure the\nfree fall acceleration of the atoms in these two magnetic sublevels, and the\nresultant E$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$tv$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$s ratio is ${\\eta _S}\n=(0.2\\pm1.2)\\times 10^{-7}$. This also gives an upper limit of $1.1\\times\n10^{-21}$ GeV/m for possible gradient field of the spacetime torsion. The\ninterferometer using atoms in $m_F=\\pm 1$ is highly sensitive to the magnetic\nfield inhomogeneity, and a double differential measurement method is developed\nto alleviate the inhomogeneity influence. Moreover, a proof experiment by\nmodulating the magnetic field is performed, which validates the alleviation of\nthe inhomogeneity influence in our test.\n", "  In this report the search for eta-mesic nuclei is reviewed. The brief\ndescription of the experimental studies is presented with a focus on the\npossible production of the eta-nucleus bound states for light nuclei like 4He\nand 3He.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are radio transients lasting only about a few\nmilliseconds. They seem to occur at cosmological distances. We propose that\nthese events can be originated in the collapse of the magnetosphere of\nKerr-Newman black holes (KNBHs). We show that the closed orbits of charged\nparticles in the magnetosphere of these objects are unstable. After examining\nthe dependencies on the specific charge of the particle and the spin and charge\nof the KNBH, we conclude that the resulting timescale and radiation mechanism\nfit well with the extant observations of FRBs. Furthermore, we argue that the\nmerger of a KNBH binary is one of the plausible central engines for potential\ngamma-ray or radio afterglow following a certain FRBs, and can also account for\ngravitational wave (GW) events like GW 150914. Our model leads to predictions\nthat can be tested by combined multi-wavelength electromagnetic and GW\nobservations.\n", "  We theoretically propose a set of universal quantum gates acting on a hybrid\nqubit formed by coupling a quantum dot spin qubit and Majorana fermion qubit.\nFirst, we consider a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to two topological\nsuperconductors. The effective spin-Majorana exchange facilitates a hybrid CNOT\ngate for which either qubit can be the control or target. The second setup is a\nmodular scalable network of topological superconductors and quantum dots. As a\nresult of the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits, a CNOT gate is\nimplemented that acts on neighboring Majorana qubits, and eliminates the\nnecessity of inter-qubit braiding. In both setups the spin-Majorana exchange\ninteraction allows for a phase gate, acting on either the spin or the Majorana\nqubit, and for a SWAP or hybrid SWAP gate which is sufficient for universal\nquantum computation without projective measurements.\n", "  Nuclear effects on neutrino reactions are expected to be a significant\ncomplication in current and future neutrino oscillation experiments seeking\nprecision measurements of neutrino flavor transitions. Calculations of these\nnuclear effects are hampered by a lack of experimental data comparing neutrino\nreactions on free nucleons to neutrino reactions on nuclei. We present results\nfrom a novel technique that compares neutrino and antineutrino charged current\nquasielastic scattering on hydrocarbons to extract a cross section ratio of\nantineutrino charged current elastic reactions on free protons to charged\ncurrent quasielastic reactions on the protons bound in a carbon nucleus. This\nmeasurement of nuclear effects is compared to models.\n", "  The occurrence of entanglement sudden death in the evolution of a bipartite\nsystem depends on both the initial state and the channel responsible for the\nevolution. An extreme case is that of entanglement braking channels, which are\nchannels that acting on only one of the subsystems drives them to full\ndisentanglement regardless of the initial state. In general, one can find\ncertain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both\nsubsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the\nchannel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this\neffect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when\nentanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an\neffective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our\nresults allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death\nor not for a given evolution. An experiment with polarization entangled photons\ndemonstrates the utility of this result in a variety of cases.\n", "  Inequality and its consequences are the subject of intense recent debate.\nUsing a simplified model of the economy, we address the relation between\ninequality and liquidity, the latter understood as the frequency of economic\nexchanges. Assuming a Pareto distribution of wealth for the agents, that is\nconsistent with empirical findings, we find an inverse relation between wealth\ninequality and overall liquidity. We show that an increase in the inequality of\nwealth results in an even sharper concentration of the liquid financial\nresources. This leads to a congestion of the flow of goods and the arrest of\nthe economy when the Pareto exponent reaches one.\n", "  We show an optimal version of the Rellich theorem for generalized many-body\nSchrodinger operators. It applies to singular potentials, in particular to a\nmodel for atoms and molecules with infinite mass and finite extent nuclei. Our\nproof relies on a Mourre estimate and a functional calculus localization\ntechnique.\n", "  The X-ray afterglows of almost one half of gamma-ray bursts have been\ndiscovered to have a shallow decay phase by the {\\em Swift} satellite, whose\norigin remains mysterious. Two main models have been proposed to explain this\nphase, relativistic wind bubbles (RWBs) and structured ejecta, which could\noriginate from millisecond magnetars and rapidly-rotating black holes,\nrespectively. Based on these models, we here investigate polarization evolution\nin the shallow decay phase of X-ray and optical afterglows. We find that in the\nRWB model, a significant bump of the polarization degree evolution curve\nappears during the shallow decay phase of both optical and X-ray afterglows,\nwhile the polarization position angle changes its direction by $90^\\circ$\nabruptly. In the structured ejecta model, however, the polarization degree does\nnot evolve significantly during the shallow decay phase of afterglows, no\nmatter whether the magnetic field configuration in the ejecta is random or\nglobally large-scale. Therefore, we conclude that these two models for the\nshallow decay phase and relevant central engines would be testable with future\npolarization observations.\n", "  We use quantum detector tomography to investigate the detection mechanism in\nWSi nanowire superconducting single photon detectors (SSPDs). To this purpose,\nwe fabricated a 250nm wide and 250nm long WSi nanowire and measured its\nresponse to impinging photons with wavelengths ranging from $\\lambda$ = 900 nm\nto $\\lambda$ = 1650 nm. Tomographic measurements show that the detector\nresponse depends on the total excitation energy only. Moreover, for energies Et\n> 0.8eV the current energy relation is linear, similar to what was observed in\nNbN nanowires, whereas the current-energy relation deviates from linear\nbehaviour for total energies below 0.8eV.\n", "  The longitudinal spin Seebeck effect is detected in sputter-deposited NiFe2O4\nfilms using Pt as a spin detector and compared to previously investigated\nNiFe2O4 films prepared by chemical vapor deposition. Anomalous Nernst effects\ninduced by the magnetic proximity effect in Pt can be excluded for the\nsputter-deposited NiFe2O4 films down to a certain limit, since x-ray resonant\nmagnetic reflectivity measurements show no magnetic response down to a limit of\n0.04 {\\mu}B per Pt atom comparable to the case of the chemicallydeposited\nNiFe2O4 films. These differently prepared films have various thicknesses.\nTherefore, we further studied Pt/Fe reference samples with various Fe\nthicknesses and could confirm that the magnetic proximity effect is only\ninduced by the interface properties of the magnetic material.\n", "  We develop an all electrical experiment to perform the broadband\nphase-resolved spectroscopy of propagating spin waves in micrometer sized thin\nmagnetic stripes. The magnetostatic surface spin waves are excited and detected\nby scaled down to 125 nm wide inductive antennas, which award ultra broadband\nwavevector capability. The wavevector selection can be done by applying an\nexcitation frequency above the ferromagnetic resonance. Wavevector\ndemultiplexing is done at the spin wave detector thanks to the rotation of the\nspin wave phase upon propagation. A simple model accounts for the main features\nof the apparatus transfer functions. Our approach opens an avenue for the all\nelectrical study of wavevector-dependent spin wave properties including\ndispersion spectra or non-reciprocal propagation.\n", "  For the purpose of applying laws or principles originated from thermal\nsystems to granular athermal systems, we may need to properly define the\ncritical temperature concept in granular powders. The conventional\nenvironmental temperature in thermal systems is too weak to drive movements of\nparticles in granular powders and cannot function as a thermal energy\nindicator. For maintaining the same functionality as in thermal systems, the\ntemperature in granular powders is defined analogously and uniformly in this\narticle. The newly defined granular temperature is utilized to describe and\nexplain one of the most important phenomena observed in granular powders, the\njamming transition, by introducing jamming temperature and jamming volume\nfraction concepts. The predictions from the equations of the jamming volume\nfractions for several cases like granular powders under shear or vibration are\nin line with experimental observations and empirical solutions in powder\nhandlings. The goal of this article is to establish similar concepts in\ngranular powders, allowing granular powders to be described with common laws or\nprinciples we are familiar with in thermal systems. Our intention is to build a\nbridge between thermal systems and granular powders to account for many\nsimilarities already found between these two systems.\n", "  The co-annihilation rate of heavy particles close to thermal equilibrium,\nwhich plays a role in many classic dark matter scenarios, can be \"simulated\" in\nQCD by considering the pair annihilation rate of a heavy quark and antiquark at\na temperature of a few hundred MeV. We show that the so-called Sommerfeld\nfactors, parameterizing the rate, can be defined and measured\nnon-perturbatively within the NRQCD framework. Lattice measurements indicate a\nmodest suppression in the octet channel, in reasonable agreement with\nperturbation theory, and a large enhancement in the singlet channel, much above\nthe perturbative prediction. The additional enhancement is suggested to\noriginate from bound state formation and subsequent decay. Making use of a\nGreen's function based method to incorporate thermal corrections in\nperturbative co-annihilation rate computations, we show that qualitative\nagreement with lattice data can be found once thermally broadened bound states\nare accounted for. We suggest that our formalism may also be applicable to\nspecific dark matter models which have complicated bound state structures.\n", "  This paper demonstrates eigenanalysis to quantitatively reveal the diversity\nand capacity of identities offered by the morphological diversity in silicon\nnanostructures formed via random collapse of resist. The analysis suggests that\napproximately 10^115 possible identities are provided per 0.18-um^2 area of\nnanostructures, indicating that nanoscale morphological signatures will be\nextremely useful for future information security applications where securing\nidentities is critical. The eigenanalysis provides an intuitive physical\npicture and quantitative characterization of the diversity of structural\nfluctuations while unifying measurement stability concerns, which will be\nwidely applicable to other materials, devices, and system architectures.\n", "  The Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a multilayered system\ncomposed of infinitely thin planes is considered using the zeta-function\nregularization approach with summation of the zero-point energies. As a\nprototype material, each plane is represented by a graphene sheet whose optical\nresponse is described by a constant conductivity or Drude-Lorentz model\nconductivity. Asymptotic expressions for various separations are derived and\ncompared to numerical calculations. We distinguish between large atom/plane\nlimit, where retardation effects are prominent, and small atom/plane limit,\nwhere the typical van der Waals coefficient is found to be dependent on the\nnumber of graphenes and characteristic distances. The calculated energies for\ndifferent atoms and graphene conductivity models brings forward the basic\nscience of the Casimir-Polder effect and suggests ways to manipulate this\ninteraction experimentally.\n", "  Gamma-ray lines from dark matter annihilation ($\\chi\\chi\\to \\gamma X$, where\n$X=\\gamma,h,Z$) are always accompanied, at lower energies, by a continuum\ngamma-ray spectrum stemming both from radiative corrections ($X=\\gamma$) and\nfrom the decay debris of the second particle possibly present in the final\nstate ($X=h,Z$). This model-independent gamma-ray emission can be exploited to\nderive novel limits on gamma-ray lines that do not rely on the line-feature.\nAlthough such limits are not expected to be as stringent, they can be used to\nprobe the existence of $\\gamma$-ray lines for dark matter masses beyond the\nlargest energies accessible to current telescopes. Here, we use continuous\ngamma-ray searches from Fermi-LAT observations of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies and from H.E.S.S. observations of the Galactic Halo to extend the\nlimits on the annihilation cross sections into monochromatic photons to dark\nmatter masses well beyond $500$ GeV (Fermi-LAT) and $20$ TeV (H.E.S.S.). In\nthis large mass regime, our results provide the first constraints on\n$\\gamma$-ray lines from dark matter annihilation.\n", "  The adsorption of benzene on the Si(100) surface is studied theoretically\nusing the self-consistent van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) method. The\nadsorption energies of two competing adsorption structures, butterfly (BF) and\ntight-bridge (TB) structures, are calculated with several vdW-DFs at saturation\ncoverage. Our results show that recently proposed vdW-DFs with high accuracy\nall prefer TB to BF, in accord with more accurate calculations based on exact\nexchange and correlation within the random phase approximation. Detailed\nanalyses reveal the important roles played by the molecule-surface interaction\nand molecular deformation upon adsorption, and we suggest that their precise\ndescription is prerequisite for accurate prediction of the most stable\nadsorption structure of organic molecules on semiconductor surfaces.\n", "  In the paper \"Some Open Problems in Chaos Theory and Dynamics\" by Zeraoulia\nand Sprott, the two-dimensional map (x,y) -> (-ax(1+y^2)^{-1}, x+by) was\nconsidered and the problem of analytical study of the boundedness of its\nattractors was formulated. In the present paper, the boundedness of its\nattractors is studied, the corresponding analytical estimation of absorbing set\nis obtained, and thus an answer to the problem is given.\n", "  There are deep, but hidden, geometric structures within jammed systems,\nassociated with hidden symmetries. These can be revealed by repeated\ntransformations under which these structures lead to fixed points. These\ngeometric structures can be found in the Voronoi tesselation of space defined\nby the packing. In this paper we examine two iterative processes: maximum\ninscribed sphere (MIS) inversion and a real-space coarsening scheme. Under\nrepeated iterations of the MIS inversion process we find invariant systems in\nwhich every particle is equal to the maximum inscribed sphere within its\nVoronoi cell. Using a real-space coarsening scheme we reveal behavior in\ngeometric order parameters which is length-scale invariant.\n", "  Characterizing the complex spectrum of topological defects in ground states\nof curved crystals is a long-standing problem with wide implications, from the\nmathematical Thomson problem to diverse physical realizations, including\nfullerenes and particle-coated droplets. While the excess number of\n\"topologically-charged\" 5-fold disclinations in a closed, spherical crystal is\nfixed, here, we study the elementary transition from defect-free, flat crystals\nto curved-crystals possessing an excess of \"charged\" disclinations in their\nbulk. Specifically, we consider the impact of topologically-neutral patterns of\ndefects -- in the form of multi-dislocation chains or \"scars\" stable for small\nlattice spacing -- on the transition from neutral to charged ground-state\npatterns of a crystalline cap bound to a spherical surface. Based on the\nasymptotic theory of caps in continuum limit of vanishing lattice spacing, we\nderive the morphological phase diagram of ground state defect patterns, spanned\nby surface coverage of the sphere and forces at the cap edge. For the singular\nlimit of zero edge forces, we find that scars reduce (by half) the threshold\nsurface coverage for excess disclinations. Even more significant, scars flatten\nthe geometric dependence of excess disinclination number on Gaussian curvature,\nleading to a transition between stable \"charged\" and \"neutral\" patterns that\nis, instead, critically sensitive to the compressive vs. tensile nature of\nboundary forces on the cap.\n", "  Due to the interaction with the environment, a quantum state is subjected to\ndecoherence which becomes one of the biggest problems for practical quantum\ncomputation. Amplitude damping is one of the most important decoherence\nprocesses. Here, we show that general two-qubit mixed states undergoing an\namplitude damping can be almost completely restored using a reversal procedure.\nThis reversal procedure through CNOT and Hadamard gates, could also protect the\nentanglement of two-qubit mixed states, when it undergoes general amplitude\ndamping. Moreover, in the presence of uncertainty in the underlying system, we\npropose a robust recovering method with optimal characteristics of the problem.\n", "  The fragility, that controls the temperature-dependent viscous properties of\nliquids as the glass transition is approached, in various glass-forming liquids\nwith different atomic interactions and densities is investigated by molecular\ndynamic simulations. We show the landscape of fragility in purely repulsive\nsystems can be separated into three regions with qualitatively disparate\ndynamic behaviors, suggesting that the density plays an unexpected role for\nunderstanding the repulsive steepness dependence of fragility. Furthermore, the\nvastly dissimilar influences of attractive interaction on fragility could be\nestimated from the structural properties of related zero-temperature glasses\n", "  We examine current fluctuations in tunnel junctions driven by a superposition\nof a constant and a sinusoidal voltage source. In standard setups the external\nvoltage is applied to the tunneling element via an impedance providing an\nelectromagnetic environment of the junction. The modes of this environment are\nexcited by the time-dependent voltage and are the source of Johnson-Nyquist\nnoise. We determine the autocorrelation function of the current flowing in the\nleads of the junction in the weak tunneling limit up to terms of second order\nin the tunneling Hamiltonian. The driven modes of the electromagnetic\nenvironment are treated exactly by means of a unitary transformation introduced\nrecently. Particular emphasis is placed on the spectral function of the current\nfluctuations. The spectrum is found to comprise three contributions: a term\narising from the Johnson-Nyquist noise of the environmental impedance, a part\ndue to the shot noise of the tunneling element and a third contribution which\ncomes from the cross-correlation between fluctuations caused by the\nelectromagnetic environment and fluctuations of the tunneling current. All\nthree parts of the spectral function occur already for devices under dc bias.\nThe spectral function of ac driven tunneling elements can be determined from\nthe result for a dc bias by means of a photo-assisted tunneling relation of the\nTien-Gordon type. Specific results are given for an Ohmic environment and for a\njunction driven through a resonator.\n", "  We have studied the prototype hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite CH3NH3PbI3\nand its three close relatives, CH3NH3SnI3, CH3NH3PbCl3 and CsPbI3, using\nrelativistic density function theory. The long-range van der Waals (vdW)\ninteractions were incorporated into the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)\nexchange-correlation functional using the Tkatchenko-Scheffler pairwise scheme.\nOur results reveal that hydrogen bonding, which is well described by the PBE\nfunctional, plays a decisive role for the structural parameters of these\nsystems, including the position and orientation of the organic cation as well\nas the deformation of the inorganic framework. The magnitude of the\ninorganic-framework deformation depends sensitively on the orientation of the\norganic cation, and directly influences the stability of the hybrid\nperovskites. Our results suggest that the organic and the inorganic components\ncomplement each other: The low symmetry of the organic cation is the origin of\nthe inorganic-framework deformation, which then aids the overall stabilization\nof the hybrid perovskite structure. This stabilization is indirectly affected\nby vdW interactions, which lead to smaller unit-cell volumes than in PBE and\ntherefore modulate the interaction between the organic cation and the inorganic\nframework. The vdW-induced lattice-constant corrections are system dependent\nand lead to PBE+vdW lattice constants in good agreement with experiment.\nFurther insight is gained by analysing the vdW contributions. In all\niodide-based hybrid perovskites the interaction between the organic cation and\nthe iodide anions provides the largest lattice-constant change, followed by\niodine-iodine and the organic cation - heavy-metal cation interaction. These\ncorrections follow an almost linear dependence on the lattice constant within\nthe range considered in our study, and are therefore approximately additive.\n", "  Colloidal model systems allow for a flexible tuning of particle sizes,\nparticle spacings and mutual interactions at constant temperature. Colloidal\nsuspensions typically crystallize as soon as the interactions get sufficiently\nstrong and long-ranged. Several strategies have been successfully applied to\navoid crystallization and instead produce colloidal glasses. Most of these\namorphous solids are formed at high particle concentrations. This paper shortly\nreviews experimental attempts to produce amorphous colloidal solids using\nstrategies based on topological, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. We\ncomplement this overview by introducing a (transient) amorphous solid forming\nin a thoroughly deionized aqueous suspension of highly charged spheres at low\nsalt concentration and very low volume fractions.\n", "  A new hybrid experiment has been constructed to measure the chemical\ncomposition of cosmic rays around the \"knee\" in the wide energy range by the\nTibet AS$\\gamma$ collaboration at Tibet, China, since 2014. They consist of a\nhigh-energy air-shower-core array (YAC-II), a high-density air-shower array\n(Tibet-III) and a large underground water-Cherenkov muon-detector array (MD).\nIn order to obtain the primary proton, helium and iron spectra and their \"knee\"\npositions in the energy range lower than $10^{16}$ eV, each of PMTs equipped to\nthe MD cell is required to measure the number of photons capable of covering a\nwide dynamic range of 100 - $10^{6}$ photoelectrons (PEs) according to Monte\nCarlo simulations. In this paper, we firstly compare the characteristic\nfeatures between R5912-PMT made by Japan Hamamatsu and CR365-PMT made by\nBeijing Hamamatsu. This is the first comparison between R5912-PMT and\nCR365-PMT. If there exists no serious difference, we will then add two\n8-inch-in-diameter PMTs to meet our requirements in each MD cell, which are\nresponsible for the range of 100 - 10000 PEs and 2000 - 1000000 PEs,\nrespectively. That is, MD cell is expected to be able to measure the number of\nmuons over 6 orders of magnitude.\n", "  Over the past few years, several occasions of large, continuous rotations of\nthe electric vector position angle (EVPA) of linearly polarized optical\nemission from blazars have been reported. These events are often coincident\nwith high energy gamma-ray flares and they have attracted considerable\nattention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic field structure in the\ngamma-ray emitting region of the jet. The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which\nis then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability\nmodels against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation\ncharacteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux\nstates, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a\nstochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process\nduring the flaring activity.\n", "  We present a numerical study of collisional transport in a tokamak pedestal\nin the presence of non-trace impurities, using the radially global $\\delta f$\nneoclassical solver PERFECT [M. Landreman et al. 2014 Plasma Phys. Control.\nFusion 56 045005]. It is known that in a tokamak core with non-trace impurities\npresent the radial impurity flux opposes the bulk ion flux to provide an\nambipolar particle transport, with the electron transport being negligibly\nsmall. However, in a sharp density pedestal with sub-sonic ion flows the\nelectron transport can be comparable to the ion and impurity flows.\nFurthermore, the neoclassical particle transport is not intrinsically\nambipolar, and the non-ambipolarity of the fluxes extends outside the pedestal\nregion by the radial coupling of the perturbations. The neoclassical momentum\ntransport, which is finite in the presence of ion orbit-width scale profile\nvariations, is significantly enhanced when impurities are present in non-trace\nquantities, even if the total parallel mass flow is dominated by the bulk ions.\n", "  The control of network-coupled nonlinear dynamical systems is an active area\nof research in the nonlinear science community. Coupled oscillator networks\nrepresent a particularly important family of nonlinear systems, with\napplications ranging from the power grid to cardiac excitation. Here we study\nthe control of network-coupled limit cycle oscillators, extending previous work\nthat focused on phase oscillators. Based on stabilizing a target fixed point,\nour method aims to attain complete frequency synchronization, i.e., consensus,\nby applying control to as few oscillators as possible. We develop two types of\ncontrol. The first type directs oscillators towards to larger amplitudes, while\nthe second does not. We present numerical examples of both control types and\ncomment on the potential failures of the method.\n", "  We present the results of a coupled-channel model for $\\bar{K}N$ scattering\nin the resonance region. The model fulfills unitarity, has the correct\nanalytical properties for the amplitudes and the partial waves have the right\nthreshold behavior. The parameters of the model have been established by\nfitting single-energy partial waves up to $J=7/2$ and up to 2.15 GeV of\ncenter-of-mass energy. The $\\Lambda^*$ and $\\Sigma^*$ spectra has been\nobtained, providing a comprehensive picture of the $S=-1$ hyperon spectrum. We\nuse the structure of the hyperon spectrum and Regge phenomenology to gain\ninsight on the nature of the $\\Lambda(1405)$ resonances.\n", "  The suitability of a particular material for use in magnetic devices is\ndetermined by the process of magnetization reversal/relaxation, which in turn\ndepends on the magnetic anisotropy. Therefore, designing new ways to control\nmagnetic anisotropy in technologically important materials is highly desirable.\nHere we show that magnetic anisotropy of epitaxial thin-films of half-metallic\nferromagnet La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) is determined by the proximity\nto thermodynamic equilibrium conditions during growth. We performed a series of\nX-ray diffraction and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments in two\ndifferent sets of samples: the first corresponds to LSMO thin-films deposited\nunder tensile strain on (001) SrTiO$_{3}$ by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD; far\nfrom thermodynamic equilibrium); the second were deposited by a slow Chemical\nSolution Deposition (CSD) method, under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Thin\nfilms prepared by PLD show a in-plane cubic anisotropy with an overimposed\nuniaxial term. A large anisotropy constant perpendicular to the film plane was\nalso observed in these films. However, the uniaxial anisotropy is completely\nsuppressed in the CSD films. The out of plane anisotropy is also reduced,\nresulting in a much stronger in plane cubic anisotropy in the chemically\nsynthesized films. This change is due to a different rotation pattern of\nMnO$_{6}$ octahedra to accomodate epitaxial strain, which depends not only on\nthe amount of tensile stress imposed by the STO substrate, but also on the\ngrowth conditions. Our results demonstrate that the nature and magnitude of the\nmagnetic anisotropy in LSMO can be tuned by the thermodynamic parameters during\nthin-film deposition.\n", "  We evaluate quantum effects due to a $2$-component Dirac field in $2+1$\nspace-time dimensions, coupled to domain-wall like defects with a smooth shape.\nWe show that those effects induce non trivial contributions to the\n(shape-dependent) energy of the domain walls. For a single defect, we study the\ndivergences in the corresponding self-energy, and also consider the role of the\nmassless zero mode, corresponding to the Callan-Harvey mechanism, by coupling\nthe Dirac field to an external gauge field. For two defects, we show that the\nDirac field induces a non trivial, Casimir-like effect between them, and\nprovide an exact expression for that interaction in the case of two\nstraight-line parallel defects. As is the case for the Casimir interaction\nenergy, the result is finite and unambiguous.\n", "  The muonium atom is the purely leptonic bound state of a positive muon and an\nelectron. It has a lifetime of 2.2 $\\mu$s. The absence of any known internal\nstructure provides for precision experiments to test fundamental physics\ntheories and to determine accurate values of fundamental constants. In\nparticular groun dstate hyperfine structure transitions can be measured by\nmicrowave spectroscopy to deliver the muon magnetic moment. The frequency of\nthe 1s-2s transition in the hydrogen-like atom can be determined with laser\nspectroscopy to obtain the muon mass. With such measurements fundamental\nphysical interactions, in particular Quantum Electrodynamics, can also be\ntested at highest precision. The results are important input parameters for\nexperiments on the muon magnetic anomaly. The simplicity of the atom enables\nfurther precise experiments, such as a search for muonium-antimuonium\nconversion for testing charged lepton number conservation and searches for\npossible antigravity of muons and dark matter.\n", "  We present a code for generating synthetic SEDs and intensity maps from\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulation snapshots. The code is based on the\nLucy (1999) Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer method, i.e. it follows discrete\nluminosity packets, emitted from external and/or embedded sources, as they\npropagate through a density field, and then uses their trajectories to compute\nthe radiative equilibrium temperature of the ambient dust. The density is not\nmapped onto a grid, and therefore the calculation is performed at exactly the\nsame resolution as the hydrodynamics. We present two example calculations using\nthis method. First, we demonstrate that the code strictly adheres to\nKirchhoff's law of radiation. Second, we present synthetic intensity maps and\nspectra of an embedded protostellar multiple system. The algorithm uses data\nstructures that are already constructed for other purposes in modern particle\ncodes. It is therefore relatively simple to implement.\n", "  We compare the spatial correlations of bond-breaking events and\nbond-orientational relaxation in a model two-dimensional liquid undergoing\nNewtonian dynamics. We find that the relaxation time of the bond-breaking\ncorrelation function is much longer than the relaxation time of the\nbond-orientational correlation function and self-intermediate scattering\nfunction. However, the relaxation time of the bond-orientational correlation\nfunction increases faster with decreasing temperature than the relaxation time\nof the bond-breaking correlation function and the self-intermediate scattering\nfunction. Moreover, the dynamic correlation length that characterizes the size\nof correlated bond-orientational relaxation grows faster with decreasing\ntemperature than the dynamic correlation length that characterizes the size of\ncorrelated bond-breaking events. We also examine the ensemble-dependent and\nensemble-independent dynamic susceptibilities for both bond-breaking\ncorrelations and bond-orientational correlations. We find that for both\ncorrelations, the ensemble-dependent and ensemble-independent susceptibilities\nexhibit a maximum at nearly the same time, and this maximum occurs at a time\nslightly shorter than the peak position of the dynamic correlation length.\n", "  The tunneling junction between one-dimensional topological superconductor and\ninteger (fractional) topological insulator (TI), realized via point contact, is\ninvestigated theoretically with bosonization technology and renormalization\ngroup methods. For the integer TI case, in a finite range of edge interaction\nparameter, there is a non-trivial stable fixed point which corresponds to the\nphysical picture that the edge of TI breaks up into two sections at the\njunction, with one side coupling strongly to the Majorana fermion and\nexhibiting perfect Andreev reflection, while the other side decouples,\nexhibiting perfect normal reflection at low energies. This fixed point can be\nused as a signature of the Majorana fermion and tested by nowadays experiment\ntechniques. For the fractional TI case, the universal low-energy transport\nproperties are described by perfect normal reflection, perfect Andreev\nreflection, or perfect insulating fixed points dependent on the filling\nfraction and edge interaction parameter of fractional TI.\n", "  It is by now established that neutrino oscillations occur due to non-zero\nmasses and parameters in the leptonic mixing matrix. The extraction of\noscillation parameters may be complicated due to subleading effects such as\nnon-standard neutrino interactions (NSI) and one needs to have a fresh look how\na particular parameter value is inferred from experimental data. In the present\nwork, we focus on an important parameter entering the oscillation framework -\nthe leptonic CP violating phase $\\delta$, about which we know very little. We\ndemonstrate that the sensitivity to CP violation gets significantly impacted\ndue to NSI effects for the upcoming long baseline experiment, Deep Underground\nNeutrino Experiment (DUNE). We also draw a comparison with the sensitivities of\nother ongoing neutrino beam experiments such as NOvA, and T2K, as well as a\nfuture generation experiment, T2HK.\n", "  The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect --- the Doppler boosting of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) photons due to Compton-scattering off free\nelectrons with non-zero bulk velocity --- probes the abundance and distribution\nof baryons in the Universe. All kSZ measurements to date have explicitly\nrequired spectroscopic redshifts. Here, we implement a novel estimator for the\nkSZ -- large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected fields: it\ndoes not require redshift estimates for individual objects, allowing kSZ\nmeasurements from large-scale imaging surveys. We apply this estimator to\ncleaned CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe data and a galaxy sample from the Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE). We measure the kSZ effect at 3.8-4.5$\\sigma$ significance,\ndepending on the use of additional WISE galaxy bias constraints. We verify that\nour measurements are robust to possible dust emission from the WISE galaxies.\nAssuming the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we directly constrain $(\n{f_{b}}/{0.158} ) ( {f_{\\rm free}}/{1.0} ) = 1.48 \\pm 0.19$ (statistical error\nonly) at redshift $z \\approx 0.4$, where $f_{b}$ is the fraction of matter in\nbaryonic form and $f_{\\rm free}$ is the free electron fraction. This is the\ntightest kSZ-derived constraint reported to date on these parameters. The\nconsistency between the $f_{b}$ value found here and the values inferred from\nanalyses of the primordial CMB and Big Bang nucleosynthesis verifies that\nbaryons approximately trace the dark matter distribution down to $\\sim$Mpc\nscales. While our projected-field estimator is already competitive with other\nkSZ approaches when applied to current datasets (because we are able to use the\nfull-sky WISE photometric survey), it will yield enormous signal-to-noise when\napplied to upcoming high-resolution, multi-frequency CMB surveys.\n", "  A novel hadron calorimeter is being developed for future lepton colliding\nbeam detectors. The calorimeter is optimized for the application of Particle\nFlow Algorithms (PFAs) to the measurement of hadronic jets and features a very\nfinely segmented readout with 1 x 1 cm2 cells. The active media of the\ncalorimeter are Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with a digital, i.e. one-bit,\nreadout. To first order the energy of incident particles in this calorimeter is\nreconstructed as being proportional to the number of pads with a signal over a\ngiven threshold. A large-scale prototype calorimeter with approximately 500,000\nreadout channels has been built and underwent extensive testing in the Fermilab\nand CERN test beams. This paper reports on the design, construction, and\ncommissioning of this prototype calorimeter.\n", "  We report a comparative study of magnetic field driven domain wall motion in\nthin films made of different magnetic materials for a wide range of field and\ntemperature. The full thermally activated creep motion, observed below the\ndepinning threshold, is shown to be described by a unique universal energy\nbarrier function. Our findings should be relevant for other systems whose\ndynamics can be modeled by elastic interfaces moving on disordered energy\nlandscapes.\n", "  We define the dielectric constant (susceptibility) that should enter the\nMaxwell boundary value problem when applied to microscopic dielectric\ninterfaces. The dielectric constant (susceptibility) of the interface is\ndefined by exact linear-response equations involving correlations of\nstatistically fluctuating interface polarization and the Coulomb interaction\nenergy of external charges with the dielectric. The theory is applied to the\ninterface between water and spherical solutes of altering size studied by\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The effective dielectric constant of\ninterfacial water is found to be significantly lower than its bulk value, and\nit also depends on the solute size. For TIP3P water used in MD simulations the\ninterface dielectric constant changes from 9 to 4 when the effective solute\nradius is increased from ~5 to 18 A.\n", "  To study the optical rotation of the polarization of light incident on\nmultilayer systems consisting of atomically thin conductors and dielectric\nmultilayers we present a general method based on transfer matrices. The\ntransfer matrix of the atomically thin conducting layer is obtained using the\nMaxwell equations. We derive expressions for the Kerr (Faraday) rotation angle\nand for the ellipticity of the reflected (transmitted) light as a function of\nthe incident angle and polarization of the light. The method is demonstrated by\ncalculating the Kerr (Faraday) angle for bilayer graphene in the quantum\nanomalous Hall state placed on the top of dielectric multilayers. The optical\nconductivity of the bilayer graphene is calculated in the framework of a\nfour-band model.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic minibands of a heterostructure consisting of\nbilayer graphene (BLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) by numerically\ndiagonalizing a two-band Hamiltonian that describes electrons in BLG in the\npresence of a moire potential. Due to inversion-symmetry breaking\ncharacteristic for the moire potential, the valley symmetry of the spectrum is\nbroken, but despite this, the zero-energy Landau level in BLG survives, albeit\nwith reduced degeneracy. In addition, we derive effective models for the\nlow-energy features in the magnetic minibands and demonstrate the appearance of\nsecondary Dirac points in the valence band, which we confirm by numerical\nsimulations. Then, we analyze how single-particle gaps in the fractal energy\nspectrum produce a sequence of incompressible states observable under a\nvariation of carrier density and magnetic field.\n", "  NMSSM has enough ingredients to explain the diphoton excess at 750 GeV:\nsinglet-like (pseudo) scalar ($a$) $s$ and higgsinos as heavy vector-like\nfermions. We consider the production of the 750 GeV singlet-like pseudo scalar\na from a decay of the doublet-like pseudo scalar $A$, and the subsequent decay\nof $a$ into two photons via higgsino loop. We demonstrate that this cascade\ndecay of the NMSSM Higgs bosons can explain the diphoton excess in the 13 TeV\ndata consistently with the absence of a significant excess in the 8 TeV data.\n", "  Under low energy and high flux/fluence irradiation of helium (He) atoms, the\nformation and bursting of He bubbles on tungsten (W) surfaces play important\nroles in the morphological evolution of component surfaces and impurity\nproduction in fusion reactors. Microscopically, the bursting of He bubbles is a\nstochastic process, and He bubbles have statistically average lifetimes. In the\npresent paper, a molecular dynamics-based method was developed to extract, for\nthe first time, the lifetime of He bubbles near tungsten surfaces. It was found\nthat He bubble bursting can be treated as an activated event. Its occurrence\nfrequency or, equivalently, the average lifetime of bubbles follows the\nArrhenius equation. For a given bubble size, the activation energy exhibits a\ngood linear dependence with the depth, and the pre-exponential factor obeys the\nMeyer-Nedle rule. These results are useful for establishing a model in\nmulti-scale simulations of impurity production in the fusion plasma and of the\nmorphological evolution of component surfaces.\n", "  We study whether a direct measurement of the absolute temperature of a\nMagnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) can be performed using the high frequency\nelectrical noise that it delivers under a finite voltage bias. Our method\nincludes quasi-static hysteresis loop measurements of the MTJ, together with\nthe field-dependence of its spin wave noise spectra. We rely on an analytical\nmodeling of the spectra by assuming independent fluctuations of the different\nsub-systems of the tunnel junction that are described as macrospin fluctuators.\nWe illustrate our method on perpendicularly magnetized MgO-based MTJs patterned\nin 50*100 nm2 nanopillars. We apply hard axis (in-plane) fields to let the\nmagnetic thermal fluctuations yield finite conductance fluctuations of the MTJ.\nInstead of the free layer fluctuations that are observed to be affected by both\nspin-torque and temperature, we use the magnetization fluctuations of the sole\nreference layers. Their much stronger anisotropy and their much heavier damping\nrender them essentially immune to spin-torque. We illustrate our method by\ndetermining current-induced heating of the perpendicularly magnetized tunnel\njunction at voltages similar to those used in spin-torque memory applications.\nThe absolute temperature can be deduced with a precision of +/- 60 K and we can\nexclude any substantial heating at the spin-torque switching voltage.\n", "  Neutron-star mergers are interesting for several reasons: they are proposed\nas the progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts, they have been speculated to be a\nsite for the synthesis of heavy elements, and they emit gravitational waves\npossibly detectable at terrestrial facilities. The understanding of the merger\nprocess, from the pre-merger stage to the final compact object-accreting system\ninvolves detailed knowledge of numerical relativity and nuclear physics. In\nparticular, key ingredients for the evolution of the merger are neutrino\nphysics and the matter equation of state. We present some aspects of neutrino\nemission from binary neutron star mergers showing the impact that the equation\nof state has on neutrinos and discuss some spectral quantities relevant to\ntheir detection such as energies and luminosities far from the source.\n", "  In this paper, we describe 220Rn calibration source that was developed for\nliquid noble gas detectors. The key advantage of this source is that it can\nprovide 212Bi-212Po consecutive events, which enables us to evaluate the vertex\nresolution of a detector at low energy by comparing low-energy events of 212Bi\nand corresponding higher-energy alpha-rays from 212Po. Since 220Rn is a noble\ngas, a hot metal getter can be used when introduced using xenon as the carrier\ngas. In addition, no long-life radioactive isotopes are left behind in the\ndetector after the calibration is complete; this has clear advantage over the\nuse of 222Rn which leaves long- life radioactivity, i.e., 210Pb. Using a small\nliquid xenon test chamber, we developed a system to introduce 220Rn via the\nxenon carrier gas; we demonstrated the successful introduction of 6 times 10^2\n220Rn atoms in our test environment.\n", "  We study the impact of including the baryonic decay $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda(\\to\np \\pi^-)\\mu^+\\mu^-$ in a Bayesian analysis of $|\\Delta B | = |\\Delta S| = 1$\ntransitions. We perform fits of the Wilson coefficients $C_{9}$, $C_{9'}$,\n$C_{10}$ and $C_{10'}$, in addition to the relevant nuisance parameters. Our\nanalysis combines data for the differential branching fraction and three\nangular observables of $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda(\\to p \\pi^-)\\mu^+\\mu^-$ with data\nfor the branching ratios of $B_s \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$ and inclusive $b \\to\ns\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays. Newly available precise lattice QCD results for the full\nset of $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ form factors are used to evaluate the\nobservables of the baryonic decay. Our fits prefer shifts to $C_{9}$ that are\nopposite in sign compared to those found in global fits of only mesonic decays,\nand the posterior odds show no evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model.\nWe investigate a possible hadronic origin of the observed tensions between\ntheory and experiment.\n", "  We present the results of an X-ray spectral analysis of 153 galaxy clusters\nobserved with the Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku space telescopes. These\nclusters, which span 0 < z < 1.5, were drawn from a larger, mass-selected\nsample of galaxy clusters discovered in the 2500 square degree South Pole\nTelescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. With a total combined exposure\ntime of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the\nevolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no\nevidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =\n-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun\nand a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun. These results imply that >60% of the\nmetals in the ICM were already in place at z=1 (at 95% confidence), consistent\nwith the picture of an early (z>1) enrichment. We find, in agreement with\nprevious works, a significantly higher mean value for the metallicity in the\ncenters of cool core clusters versus non-cool core clusters. We find weak\nevidence for evolution in the central metallicity of cool core clusters (dZ/dz\n= -0.21 +/- 0.11 Zsun), which is sufficient to account for this enhanced\ncentral metallicity over the past ~10 Gyr. We find no evidence for metallicity\nevolution outside of the core (dZ/dz = -0.03 +/- 0.06 Zsun), and no significant\ndifference in the core-excised metallicity between cool core and non-cool core\nclusters. This suggests that strong radio-mode AGN feedback does not\nsignificantly alter the distribution of metals at r>0.15R500. Given the\nlimitations of current-generation X-ray telescopes in constraining the ICM\nmetallicity at z>1, significant improvements on this work will likely require\nnext-generation X-ray missions.\n", "  We discuss direct and indirect probes of chirality-flipping couplings of the\ntop quark to Higgs and gauge bosons, considering both CP-conserving and\nCP-violating observables, in the framework of the Standard Model effective\nfield theory. In our analysis we include current and prospective constraints\nfrom collider physics, precision electroweak tests, flavor physics, and\nelectric dipole moments (EDMs). We find that low-energy indirect probes are\nvery competitive, even after accounting for long-distance uncertainties. In\nparticular, EDMs put constraints on the electroweak CP-violating dipole moments\nof the top that are two to three orders of magnitude stronger than existing\nlimits. The new indirect constraint on the top EDM is given by $|d_t| < 5 \\cdot\n10^{-20}$ e cm at $90\\%$ C.L.\n", "  The meteoritical record shows both iron partitioning and tungsten isotopic\npartitioning between matrix and chondrules. Tungsten is not abundant enough to\nhave driven its own isotopic partitioning, but if tungsten were correlated with\niron, then ferromagnetic interactions grains could help explain both\nobservations. We derive a practical parameterization for the increase in\nparticle-particle collision rates caused by mutually attracting particle\nmagnetic dipole moments. While the appropriate magnetic parameters remain\nuncertain, we show that ambient magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks are\nexpected to be strong enough to magnetize iron metal bearing dust grains\nsufficiently to drive large increases in their collision rates. Such increased\ncollision rates between iron metal rich grains could help preserve primordial\niron and W isotopic inhomogeneities; and would help explain why the\nmeteoritical record shows their partitioning in the solar nebula. The\nimportance of magnetic interactions for larger grains whose growth is balanced\nby fragmentation is less clear, and will require future laboratory or numerical\nstudies.\n", "  Constrained density functional theory (cDFT) is a versatile electronic\nstructure method that enables ground-state calculations to be performed subject\nto physical constraints. It thereby broadens their applicability and utility.\nAutomated Lagrange multiplier optimisation is necessary for multiple\nconstraints to be applied efficiently in cDFT, for it to be used in tandem with\ngeometry optimization, or with molecular dynamics. In order to facilitate this,\nwe comprehensively develop the connection between cDFT energy derivatives and\nresponse functions, providing a rigorous assessment of the uniqueness and\ncharacter of cDFT stationary points while accounting for electronic\ninteractions and screening. In particular, we provide a new, non-perturbative\nproof that stable stationary points of linear density constraints occur only at\nenergy maxima with respect to their Lagrange multipliers. We show that multiple\nsolutions, hysteresis, and energy discontinuities may occur in cDFT.\nExpressions are derived, in terms of convenient by-products of cDFT\noptimization, for quantities such as the dielectric function and a condition\nnumber quantifying ill-definition in multi-constraint cDFT.\n", "  There is a well explored relationship between quantum mechanical scattering\nfrom a potential and the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation of fluid dynamics: if\nthe potential is 'evolved' according to the KdV equation then it will have the\nsame reflectivity and transmissivity as a function of energy, for each snapshot\nin time. In this work we explore this connection in optics, where the\npermittivity plays the role of the potential. We begin by deriving the\nrelationship between the Helmholtz equation and the KdV equation in terms of\nthe current induced in a material when a permittivity profile is changed\nslightly. It is then shown that the KdV equation can be used to design a\nplethora of bounded complex potentials that are relfectionless from both sides\nfor all angles of incidence, and planar periodic media that exhibit a real\nBloch vector for all angles of propagation. Finally we apply the KdV equation\nto reduce the reflection of a wave from an interface between two media of\ndiffering refractive indices.\n", "  To address the problem of the shortage of neutron detectors used in radiation\nportal monitors (RPMs), caused by the 3He supply crisis, research on a\ncadmium-based capture-gated fast neutron detector is presented in this paper.\nThe detector is composed of many 1 cm * 1 cm * 20 cm plastic scintillator\ncuboids covered by 0.1 mm thick film of cadmium. The detector uses cadmium to\nabsorb thermal neutrons and produce capture gamma-rays to indicate the\ndetection of neutrons, and uses plastic scintillator to moderate neutrons and\nregister gamma-rays. This design removes the volume competing relationship in\ntraditional 3He counter-based fast neutron detectors, which hinders enhancement\nof the neutron detection efficiency. Detection efficiency of 21.66 +- 1.22% has\nbeen achieved with a 40.4 cm * 40.4 cm * 20 cm overall detector volume. This\ndetector can measure both neutrons and gamma-rays simultaneously. A small\ndetector (20.2 cm * 20.2 cm * 20 cm) demonstrated a 3.3 % false alarm rate for\na 252Cf source with a neutron yield of 1841 n/s from 50 cm away within 15\nseconds measurement time. It also demonstrated a very low (< 0.06%) false alarm\nrate for a 3.21 * 105 Bq 137Cs source. This detector offers a potential\nsingle-detector replacement for both neutron and the gamma-ray detectors in RPM\nsystems.\n", "  The first-principles band theory paradigm has been a key player not only in\nthe process of discovering new classes of topologically interesting materials,\nbut also for identifying salient characteristics of topological states,\nenabling direct and sharpened confrontation between theory and experiment. We\nbegin this review by discussing underpinnings of the topological band theory,\nwhich basically involves a layer of analysis and interpretation for assessing\ntopological properties of band structures beyond the standard band theory\nconstruct. Methods for evaluating topological invariants are delineated,\nincluding crystals without inversion symmetry and interacting systems. The\nextent to which theoretically predicted properties and protections of\ntopological states have been verified experimentally is discussed, including\nwork on topological crystalline insulators, disorder/interaction driven\ntopological insulators (TIs), topological superconductors, Weyl semimetal\nphases, and topological phase transitions. Successful strategies for new\nmaterials discovery process are outlined. A comprehensive survey of currently\npredicted 2D and 3D topological materials is provided. This includes binary,\nternary and quaternary compounds, transition metal and f-electron materials,\nWeyl and 3D Dirac semimetals, complex oxides, organometallics, skutterudites\nand antiperovskites. Also included is the emerging area of 2D atomically thin\nfilms beyond graphene of various elements and their alloys, functional thin\nfilms, multilayer systems, and ultra-thin films of 3D TIs, all of which hold\nexciting promise of wide-ranging applications. We conclude by giving a\nperspective on research directions where further work will broadly benefit the\ntopological materials field.\n", "  A single electron dynamic memory is designed based on the non-equilibrium\ndynamics of charge states in electrostatically-defined metallic quantum dots.\nUsing the orthodox theory for computing the transfer rates and a master\nequation, we model the dynamical response of devices consisting of a charge\nsensor coupled to either a single and or a double quantum dot subjected to a\npulsed gate voltage. We show that transition rates between charge states in\nmetallic quantum dots are characterized by an asymmetry that can be controlled\nby the gate voltage. This effect is more pronounced when the switching between\ncharge states corresponds to a Markovian process involving electron transport\nthrough a chain of several quantum dots. By simulating the dynamics of electron\ntransport we demonstrate that the quantum box operates as a finite-state\nmachine that can be addressed by choosing suitable shapes and switching rates\nof the gate pulses. We further show that writing times in the ns range and\nretention memory times six orders of magnitude longer, in the ms range, can be\nachieved on the double quantum dot system using experimentally feasible\nparameters thereby demonstrating that the device can operate as a dynamic\nsingle electron memory.\n", "  After a brief review of the cosmological lithium problem, we report a few\nrecent attempts to find theoretical solutions by our group at Texas A&M\nUniversity (Commerce & College Station). We will discuss our studies on the\ntheoretical description of electron screening, the possible existence of\nparallel universes of dark matter, and the use of non-extensive statistics\nduring the Big Bang nucleosynthesis epoch. Last but not least, we discuss\npossible solutions within nuclear physics realm. The impact of recent\nmeasurements of relevant nuclear reaction cross sections for the Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis based on indirect methods is also assessed. Although our\nattempts may not able to explain the observed discrepancies between theory and\nobservations, they suggest theoretical developments that can be useful also for\nstellar nucleosynthesis.\n", "  We investigate meson's spectrum, decay constant and form factor in a nuclear\nmedium through holographic two- and three-point correlation functions. To\ndescribe a nuclear medium composed of protons and neutrons, we consider a hard\nwall model on the thermal charged AdS geometry and show that due to the isospin\ninteraction with a nuclear medium, there exist splittings of the meson's\nspectrum, decay constant and form factor relying on the isospin charge. In\naddition, we show that the $\\rho$-meson's form factor describing an interaction\nwith pseudoscalar fluctuation decreases when the nuclear density increases,\nwhile the interaction with a longitudinal part of an axial vector meson\nincreases.\n", "  We construct a class of quadratic gauge invariant actions for extended string\nfields defined on the tensor product of open superstring state space for\nmultiple open string Neveu-Schwarz (NS) sectors with or without one Ramond (R)\nsector. The basic idea is the same as for the bosonic extended string field\ntheory developed by the authors [arXiv:1309.3850]. The theory for NS^n sector\nand NS^{n-1}-R sector contains general n-th rank tensor fields and (n-1)-th\nrank spinor-tensor fields in the massless spectrum respectively. In principle,\nconsistent gauge invariant actions for any generic type of 10-dimensional\nmassive or massless tensor or spinor-tensor fields can be extracted from the\ntheory. We discuss some simple examples of bosonic and fermionic massless\nactions.\n", "  We derive a new relation between cosological distances, valid in any\n(statistically) isotropic space-time and independent of cosmological parameters\nor even the validity of the field equation of General Relativity. In\nparticular, this relation yields an equation between those distance ratios\nwhich are the geometrical factors determining the strength of the gravitational\nlensing effect of mass concentrations. Considering a combination of weak\nlensing shear ratios, based on lenses at two different redshifts, and sources\nat three different redshifts, we derive a relation between shear-ratio tests\nwhich must be identically satisfied. A redshift-dependent multiplicative bias\nin shear estimates will violate this relation, and thus can be probed by this\ngeneralized shear-ratio test. Combining the lensing effect for lenses at three\ndifferent redshifts and three different source redshifts, a relation between\nshear ratios is derived which must be valid independent of a multiplicative\nbias. We propose these generalized shear-ratio tests as a diagnostic for the\npresence of systematics in upcoming weak lensing surveys.\n", "  The cochlea provides a biological information-processing paradigm that we\nonly begin to under- stand in its full complexity. Our work reveals an\ninteracting network of strongly nonlinear dynami- cal nodes, on which even\nsimple sound input triggers subnetworks of activated elements that follow\npower-law size statistics ('avalanches'). From dynamical systems theory,\npower-law size distribu- tions relate to a fundamental ground-state of\nbiological information processing. Learning destroys these power laws. These\nresults strongly modify the models of mammalian sound processing and provide a\nnovel methodological perspective for understanding how the brain processes\ninformation.\n", "  Extensive computer simulations are performed for a few model glass-forming\nliquids in both two and three dimensions to study their dynamics when a\nrandomly chosen fraction of particles are frozen in their equilibrium\npositions. For all the studied systems, we find that the temperature-dependence\nof the $\\alpha$ relaxation time extracted from an overlap function related to\nthe self part of the density autocorrelation function can be explained within\nthe framework of the Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory of the glass\ntransition. We propose a scaling description to rationalize the simulation\nresults and show that our data for the $\\alpha$ relaxation time for all\ntemperatures and pin concentrations are consistent with this description. We\nfind that the fragility parameter obtained from fits of the temperature\ndependence of the $\\alpha$ relaxation time to the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT)\nform decreases by almost an order of magnitude as the pin concentration is\nincreased from zero. Our scaling description relates the fragility parameter to\nthe static length scale of RFOT and thus provides a physical understanding of\nfragility within the framework of the RFOT theory. Implications of these\nfindings for the values of the exponents appearing in the RFOT theory are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The buildup of low energy electrons in an accelerator, known as electron\ncloud, can be severely detrimental to machine performance. Under certain beam\nconditions, the beam can become resonant with the cloud dynamics, accelerating\nthe buildup of electrons. This paper will examine two such effects:\nmultipacting resonances, in which the cloud development time is resonant with\nthe bunch spacing, and cyclotron resonances, in which the cyclotron period of\nelectrons in a magnetic field is a multiple of bunch spacing. Both resonances\nhave been studied directly in dipole fields using retarding field analyzers\ninstalled in the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR). These measurements are\nsupported by both analytical models and computer simulations.\n", "  We present the results of particle-in-cell numerical pair plasma simulations\nof relativistic 2D magnetostatic equilibria known as the 'ABC' fields. In\nparticular, we focus on the lowest-order unstable configuration consisting of\ntwo minima and two maxima of the magnetic vector potential. Breaking of the\ninitial symmetry leads to exponential growth of the electric energy and to the\nformation of two current layers, which is consistent with the picture of\n'X-point collapse' first described by Syrovatskii. Magnetic reconnection within\nthe layers heats a fraction of particles to very high energies. After the\nsaturation of the linear instability, the current layers are disrupted and the\nsystem evolves chaotically, diffusing the particle energies in a stochastic\nsecond-order Fermi process leading to the formation of power-law energy\ndistributions. The power-law slopes harden with the increasing mean\nmagnetization, but they are significantly softer than those produced in\nsimulations initiated from Harris-type layers. The maximum particle energy is\nproportional to the mean magnetization, which is attributed partly to the\nincrease of the effective electric field and partly to the increase of the\nacceleration time scale. We describe in detail the evolving structure of the\ndynamical current layers, and report on the conservation of magnetic helicity.\nThese results can be applied to highly magnetized astrophysical environments,\nwhere ideal plasma instabilities trigger rapid magnetic dissipation with\nefficient particle acceleration and flares of high-energy radiation.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of physics effects generated by leptoquarks\n(LQs), i.e., hypothetical particles that can turn quarks into leptons and vice\nversa, of either scalar or vector nature. These considerations include\ndiscussion of possible completions of the Standard Model that contain LQ\nfields. The main focus of the review is on those LQ scenarios that are not\nproblematic with regard to proton stability. We accordingly concentrate on the\nphenomenology of light leptoquarks that is relevant for precision experiments\nand particle colliders. Important constraints on LQ interactions with matter\nare derived from precision low-energy observables such as electric dipole\nmoments, (g-2) of charged leptons, atomic parity violation, neutral meson\nmixing, Kaon, B, and D meson decays, etc. We provide a general analysis of\nindirect constraints on the strength of LQ interactions with the quarks and\nleptons to make statements that are as model independent as possible. We\naddress complementary constraints that originate from electroweak precision\nmeasurements, top, and Higgs physics. The Higgs physics analysis we present\ncovers not only the most recent but also expected results from the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). We finally discuss direct LQ searches. Current experimental\nsituation is summarized and self-consistency of assumptions that go into\nexisting accelerator-based searches is discussed. A progress in making\nnext-to-leading order predictions for both pair and single LQ productions at\ncolliders is also outlined.\n", "  Systems of particles interacting via inverse-power law potentials have an\ninvariance with respect to changes in length and temperature, implying a\ncorrespondence in the dynamics and thermodynamics between different\n`isomorphic' sets of temperatures and densities. In a recent series of works,\nit has been argued that such correspondences hold to a surprisingly good\napproximation in a much more general class of potentials, an observation that\nsummarizes many properties that have been observed in the past. In this paper\nwe show that such relations are exact in high-dimensional liquids and glasses,\na limit in which the conditions for these mappings to hold become transparent.\nThe special role played by the exponential potential is also confirmed.\n", "  This paper introduces the concept of Conjectural Link for Complex Networks,\nin particular, social networks. Conjectural Link we understand as an implicit\nlink, not available in the network, but supposed to be present, based on the\ncharacteristics of its topology. It is possible, for example, when in the\nformal description of the network some connections are skipped due to errors,\ndeliberately hidden or withdrawn (e.g. in the case of partial destruction of\nthe network). Introduced a parameter that allows ranking the Conjectural Link.\nThe more this parameter - the more likely that this connection should be\npresent in the network. This paper presents a method of recovery of partially\ndestroyed Complex Networks using Conjectural Links finding. Presented two\nmethods of finding the node pairs that are not linked directly to one another,\nbut have a great possibility of Conjectural Link communication among\nthemselves: a method based on the determination of the resistance between two\nnodes, and method based on the computation of the lengths of routes between two\nnodes. Several examples of real networks are reviewed and performed a\ncomparison to know network links prediction methods, not intended to find the\nmissing links in already formed networks.\n", "  We present measurements of the near-side of triggered di-hadron correlations\nusing neutral strange baryons ($\\Lambda$, $\\bar{\\Lambda}$) and mesons ($K^0_S$)\nat intermediate transverse momentum (3 $<$ $p_T$ $<$ 6 GeV/$c$) to look for\npossible flavor and baryon/meson dependence. This study is performed in $d$+Au,\nCu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV measured by the STAR\nexperiment at RHIC. The near-side di-hadron correlation contains two\nstructures, a peak which is narrow in azimuth and pseudorapidity consistent\nwith correlations due to jet fragmentation, and a correlation in azimuth which\nis broad in pseudorapidity. The particle composition of the jet-like\ncorrelation is determined using identified associated particles. The dependence\nof the conditional yield of the jet-like correlation on the trigger particle\nmomentum, associated particle momentum, and centrality for correlations with\nunidentified trigger particles are presented. The neutral strange particle\ncomposition in jet-like correlations with unidentified charged particle\ntriggers is not well described by PYTHIA. However, the yield of unidentified\nparticles in jet-like correlations with neutral strange particle triggers is\ndescribed reasonably well by the same model.\n", "  In this paper we derive the projectors to all irreducible SO(d)\nrepresentations (traceless mixed-symmetry tensors) that appear in the partial\nwave decomposition of a conformal correlator of four stress-tensors in d\ndimensions. These projectors are given in a closed form for arbitrary length\n$l_1$ of the first row of the Young diagram. The appearance of Gegenbauer\npolynomials leads directly to recursion relations in $l_1$ for seed conformal\nblocks. Further results include a differential operator that generates the\nprojectors to traceless mixed-symmetry tensors and the general normalization\nconstant of the shadow operator.\n", "  In the composite Higgs models, originally proposed by Georgi and Kaplan, the\nHiggs boson is a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of spontaneous breaking of\na global symmetry. In the minimal version of such models, global SO(5) symmetry\nis spontaneously broken to SO(4), and the pNGBs form an isospin doublet field,\nwhich corresponds to the Higgs doublet in the Standard Model (SM). Predicted\ncoupling constants of the Higgs boson can in general deviate from the SM\npredictions, depending on the compositeness parameter. The deviation pattern is\ndetermined also by the detail of the matter sector. We comprehensively study\nhow the model can be tested via measuring single and double production\nprocesses of the Higgs boson at LHC and future electron-positron colliders. The\npossibility to distinguish the matter sector among the minimal composite Higgs\nmodels is also discussed. In addition, we point out differences in the cross\nsection of double Higgs boson production from the prediction in other new\nphysics models.\n", "  We propose a nonlocal Poisson-Fermi model for ionic solvent that includes ion\nsize effects and polarization correlations among water molecules in the\ncalculation of electrostatic potential. It includes the previous Poisson-Fermi\nmodels as special cases, and its solution is the convolution of a solution of\nthe corresponding nonlocal Poisson dielectric model with a Yukawa-type kernel\nfunction. Moreover, the Fermi distribution is shown to be a set of optimal\nionic concentration functions in the sense of minimizing an electrostatic\npotential free energy. Finally, numerical results are reported to show the\ndifference between a Poisson-Fermi solution and a corresponding Poisson\nsolution.\n", "  We discuss certain quadratic models of spinless fermions on a 1D lattice, and\ntheir corresponding spin chains. These were studied by Keating and Mezzadri in\nthe context of their relation to the Haar measures of the classical compact\ngroups. We show how these models correspond to translation invariant models on\nan infinite or semi-infinite chain, which in the simplest case reduce to the\nfamiliar XX model. We give physical context to mathematical results for the\nentanglement entropy, and calculate the spin-spin correlation functions using\nthe Fisher-Hartwig conjecture. These calculations rigorously demonstrate\nuniversality in classes of these models. We show that these are in agreement\nwith field theoretic and renormalization group arguments that we provide.\n", "  In this letter, we consider through simulation Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\n(RKKY) interactions between nanomagnets sitting on a conductive surface, and\nvoltage-controlled gating thereof for low-energy switching of nanomagnets for\npossible memory and nonvolatile logic applications. For specificity, we\nconsider nanomagnets with perpendicular anisotropy on a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator. We model the possibility and dynamics of RKKY-based\nswitching of one nanomagnet by coupling to one or more nanomagnets of set\norientation. Applications for both memory and nonvolatile logic are considered,\nwith follower, inverter and majority gate functionality shown. Sub-attojoule\nswitching energies, far below conventional spin transfer torque (STT)-based\nmemories and even below CMOS logic appear possible. Switching times on the\norder of a few nanoseconds, comparable to times for STT switching, are\nestimated for ferromagnetic nanomagnets.\n", "  We present the design of a compact optical clock based on the $^2S_{1/2}\n\\rightarrow ^2D_{3/2}$ 435.5 nm transition in $^{171}$Yb$^+$. The ion trap will\nbe based on a micro-fabricated circuit, with surface electrodes generating a\ntrapping potential to localize a single Yb ion a few hundred $\\mu$m from the\nelectrodes. We present our trap design as well as simulations of the resulting\ntrapping pseudo-potential. We also present a compact, multi-channel wavelength\nmeter that will permit the frequency stabilization of the cooling, repumping\nand clear-out lasers at 369.5 nm, 935.2 nm and 638.6 nm needed to cool the ion.\nWe use this wavelength meter to characterize and stabilize the frequency of\nextended cavity diode lasers at 369.5 nm and 638.6 nm.\n", "  The influence of in-plane and canted magnetic fields on spin spirals and\nskyrmions in atomic bilayer islands of palladium and iron on an Ir(111)\nsubstrate is investigated by scanning tunnelling microscopy at low\ntemperatures. It is shown that the spin spiral propagation direction is\ndetermined by the island's border which can be explained by equilibrium state\ncalculations on a triangular lattice. By application of in-plane fields, the\nspin spiral reorientates its propagation direction and becomes distorted,\nthereby allowing a proof for its cycloidal nature. Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated that the skyrmions' shape is distorted in canted fields which\nallows to determine the sense of magnetisation rotation as enforced by the\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n", "  Parker's formulation of isotopological plasma relaxation process toward\nminimum magnetics energy states in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is extended to\nelectron MHD (EMHD).\n  The lower bound on magnetic energy in EMHD is determined by both the magnetic\nfield and the electron vorticity field topologies, and is shown to be reduced\nfurther in EMHD by an amount proportional to the sum of total electron-flow\nkinetic energy and total electron-flow enstrophy. The EMHD Beltrami condition\nbecomes equivalent to the potential vorticity conservation equation in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamics, and the torsion coefficient and turns out\nto be proportional to potential vorticity. The winding pattern of the magnetic\nfield lines appears to evolve therefore in the same way as \"potential\nvorticity\" lines in 2D hydrodynamics.\n", "  We address the problem of diffusion on a comb whose teeth display a varying\nlength. Specifically, the length $\\ell$ of each tooth is drawn from a\nprobability distribution displaying the large-$\\ell$ behavior $P(\\ell) \\sim\n\\ell^{-(1+\\alpha)}$ ($\\alpha>0$). Our method is based on the mean-field\ndescription provided by the well-tested CTRW approach for the random comb\nmodel, and the obtained analytical result for the diffusion coefficient is\nconfirmed by numerical simulations. We subsequently incorporate retardation\neffects arising from binding/unbinding kinetics into our model and obtain a\nscaling law characterizing the corresponding change in the diffusion\ncoefficient. Finally, our results for the diffusion coefficient are used as an\ninput to compute concentration recovery curves mimicking FRAP experiments in\ncomb-like geometries such as spiny dendrites. We show that such curves cannot\nbe fitted perfectly by a model based on scaled Brownian motion, i.e., a\nstandard diffusion equation with a time-dependent diffusion coefficient.\nHowever, differences between the exact curves and such fits are small, thereby\nproviding justification for the practical use of models relying on scaled\nBrownian motion as a fitting procedure for recovery curves arising from\nparticle diffusion in comb-like systems.\n", "  The quantum spin Hall effect has been predicted theoretically and observed\nexperimentally in InAs/GaSb quantum wells as a result of inverted band\nstructures, for which electron bands in InAs layers are below heavy hole bands\nin GaSb layers in energy. The hybridization between electron bands and heavy\nhole bands leads to a hybridization gap away from k=0. A recent puzzling\nobservation in experiments is that when the system is tuned to more inverted\nregime by a gate voltage (a larger inverted gap at k=0), the hybridization gap\ndecreases. Motivated by this experiment, we explore the dependence of\nhybridization gap as a function of external electric fields based on the\neight-band Kane model. We identify two regimes when varying electric fields:\n(1) both inverted and hybridization gaps increase and (2) inverted gap\nincreases while hybridization gap decreases. Based on the effective model, we\nfind that light-hole bands in GaSb layers play an important role in determining\nhybridization gap. In addition, a large external electric field can induce a\nstrong Rashba splitting and also influence hybridization gap.\n", "  We present an angle-resolved photoemission study of the electronic structure\nof the three-dimensional pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 through its magnetic\nmetal-insulator transition. Our data reveal that metallic Nd2Ir2O7 has a\nquadratic band, touching the Fermi level at the Gamma point, similarly to that\nof Pr2Ir2O7. The Fermi node state is, therefore, a common feature of the\nmetallic phase of the pyrochlore iridates. Upon cooling below the transition\ntemperature, this compound exhibits a gap opening with an energy shift of\nquasiparticle peaks like a band gap insulator. The quasiparticle peaks are\nstrongly suppressed, however, with further decrease of temperature, and\neventually vanish at the lowest temperature, leaving a non-dispersive flat band\nlacking long-lived electrons. We thereby identify a remarkable crossover from\nSlater to Mott insulators with decreasing temperature. These observations\nexplain the puzzling absence of Weyl points in this material, despite its\nproximity to the zero temperature metal-insulator transition.\n", "  We develop an analytical theory that accounts for the image and surface\ncharge interactions between a charged dielectric membrane and a DNA molecule\ntranslocating through the membrane. Translocation events through neutral\ncarbon-based membranes are driven by a competition between the repulsive\nDNA-image-charge interactions and the attractive coupling between the DNA\nsegments on the trans and the cis sides of the membrane. The latter effect is\ninduced by the reduction of the coupling by the dielectric membrane. In strong\nsalt solutions where the repulsive image-charge effects dominate the attractive\ntrans-cis coupling, the DNA molecule encounters a translocation barrier of ~10\nkBT. In dilute electrolytes, the trans-cis coupling takes over image-charge\nforces and the membrane becomes a metastable attraction point that can trap\ntranslocating polymers over long time intervals. This mechanism can be used in\ntranslocation experiments in order to control the DNA motion by tuning the salt\nconcentration of the solution.\n", "  Binary mixtures of large and small particles with disparate size ratio\nexhibit a rich phenomenology at their glass transition points. In order to gain\ninsights on such systems, we introduce and study a two-component version of the\n$p$-spin spherical spin glass model. We employ the replica method to calculate\nthe free energy and the phase diagram. We show that when the strengths of the\ninteractions of each component are not widely separated, the model has only one\nglass phase characterized by the conventional one-step replica symmetry\nbreaking. However when the strengths of the interactions are well separated,\nthe model has three glass phases depending on temperature and component ratio.\nOne is the \"single\" glass phase in which only the spins of one component are\nfrozen while the spins of the other component remain mobile. This phase is\ncharacterized by the one-step replica symmetry breaking. The second is the\n\"double\" glass phase obtained by cooling further the single glass phase, in\nwhich the spins of the remaining mobile component are also frozen. This phase\nis characterized by the two-step replica symmetry breaking. The third is also\nthe \"double\" glass phase, which however is formed by the simultaneous freezing\nof the spins of both components at the same temperatures and is characterized\nby the one-step replica symmetry breaking. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for the glass transitions of binary mixtures.\n", "  We discuss the X(5568) particle recently announced by the D0 Collaboration.\nSeveral types of models were proposed to explain this structure in the\nliterature. As pointed out by Burns and Swanson (arXiv:1603.04366), none of\nthem provides a satisfactory description of the observation. We provide\nadditional arguments using general properties of QCD, and conclude that the\nobservation of the X(5568), if confirmed, poses serious challenges to our\nunderstanding of nonperturbative QCD.\n", "  The CMS collaboration has reported a possible lepton flavour violating (LFV)\nsignal $h\\to\\mu\\tau$. Whereas this does not happen in the standard model (SM),\nwe point out that new physics responsible for this type of decay would, in\ngeneral, also produce charge-parity (CP) violation in $h\\to \\tau\\tau$. We\nestimate the size of this effect in a model independent manner and find that a\nlarge asymmetry, of order 25\\%, is allowed by current constraints.\n", "  It is believed that curvature singularities are a creation of general\nrelativity and hence, in the absence of a quantum gravity, models of\nnonsingular black holes have received significant attention. We study the\nshadow (apparent shape), an optical appearance because of its strong\ngravitational field, cast by a nonsingular black hole which is characterized by\nthree parameters, i.e., mass ($M$), spin ($a$), and a deviation parameter\n($k$). The nonsingular black hole under consideration, is a generalization of\nthe Kerr black hole {that} can be recognized asymptotically ($r>>k, k>0$)\nexplicitly as the Kerr-Newman black hole, and in the limit $k \\rightarrow 0$ as\nthe Kerr black hole. It turns out that the shadow of a nonsingular black hole\nis a dark zone covered by {a} deformed circle. Interestingly, it is seen that\nthe shadow of a black hole is affected due to the parameter $k$. Indeed, for a\ngiven $a$, the size of a shadow reduces as the parameter $k$ increases and the\nshadow becomes more distorted as we increase the value of the parameter $k$\nwhen compared with the analogous Kerr black hole shadow. We also investigate,\nin detail, how the ergoregion of a black hole is changed due to the deviation\nparameter $k$.\n", "  In this work we extend the discussion that was began in the Ref. [A. L. de\nPaula Jr., J. G. G. de Oliveira Jr., J. G. Peixoto de Faria, Dagoberto S.\nFreitas and M. C. Nemes, {\\it Phys. Rev.} {\\bf A89}, (2014) 022303] to deal\nwith the dynamics of the concurrence of a many-body system. In that previous\npaper, the discussion was focused in the residual entanglement between the\npartitions of the system. The purpose of the present contribution is to shed\nsome light on the dynamical properties of entanglement among the environment\noscillators. We consider a system consisting of a harmonic oscillator linearly\ncoupled to N others and solve the corresponding dynamical problem analytically.\nWe divide the environment in arbitrary two partitions and the entanglement\ndynamics between any of these partitions is quantified and it shows that in the\ncase that excitations in each partitions are equal, the concurrence reaches the\nvalue one and the two partition of the environment are maximally entangled. For\nlong times the excitations of the main oscillator are completely transferred to\nenvironment and the environment oscillators are found entangled.\n", "  We consider the diphoton excess observed by ATLAS and CMS using the most\nup-to-date data and estimate the preferred enhancement in the production rate\nbetween 8 TeV and 13 TeV. Within the framework of effective field theory (EFT),\nwe then show that for both spin-0 and spin-2 Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet\nresonances, two of the three processes S to ZZ, S to Z gamma, and S to WW must\noccur with a non-zero rate. Moreover, we demonstrate that these branching\nratios are highly correlated in the EFT. Couplings of S to additional SM states\nmay be constrained and differentiated by comparing the S production rates with\nand without the vector-boson fusion (VBF) cuts. We find that for a given VBF to\ninclusive production ratio there is maximum rate of S to gauge bosons, b b-bar,\nand lighter quark anti-quark pairs. Simultaneous measurements of the width and\nthe VBF ratio may be able to point towards the existence of hidden decays.\n", "  Reaction-diffusion systems with time-delay defined on complex networks have\nbeen studied in the framework of the emergence of Turing instabilities. The use\nof the Lambert W-function allowed us get explicit analytic conditions for the\nonset of patterns as a function of the main involved parameters, the\ntime-delay, the network topology and the diffusion coefficients. Depending on\nthese parameters, the analysis predicts whether the system will evolve towards\na stationary Turing pattern or rather to a wave pattern associated to a Hopf\nbifurcation. The possible outcomes of the linear analysis overcome the\nrespective limitations of the single-species case with delay, and that of the\nclassical activator-inhibitor variant without delay. Numerical results gained\nfrom the Mimura-Murray model support the theoretical approach.\n", "  We review the combinatorial, topological, algebraic and metric properties\nsupported by $(D+1)$-colored graphs, with a focus on those that are pertinent\nto the study of tensor model theories. We show how to extract a limiting\ncontinuum metric space from this set of graphs and detail properties of this\nlimit through the calculation of exponents at criticality.\n", "  We present a new approximation to include fully general relativistic pressure\nand velocity in Newtonian hydrodynamics. The energy conservation, momentum\nconservation and two Poisson's equations are consistently derived from\nEinstein's gravity in the zero-shear gauge assuming weak gravity and\naction-at-a-distance limit. The equations show proper special relativity limit\nin the absence of gravity. Our approximation is complementary to the\npost-Newtonian approximation and the equations are valid in fully nonlinear\nsituations.\n", "  Relativistic flying mirrors in plasmas are realized as thin dense electron\n(or electron-ion) layers accelerated by high-intensity electromagnetic waves to\nvelocities close to the speed of light in vacuum. The reflection of an\nelectromagnetic wave from the relativistic mirror results in its energy and\nfrequency changing. In a counter-propagation configuration, the frequency of\nthe reflected wave is multiplied by the factor proportional to the Lorentz\nfactor squared. This scientific area promises the development of sources of\nultrashort X-ray pulses in the attosecond range. The expected intensity will\nreach the level at which the effects predicted by nonlinear quantum\nelectrodynamics start to play a key role.\n", "  Superconducting Quantum Interference Filters (SQIFs) are arrays of\nsuperconducting loops of different sizes including Josephson Junctions (JJ).\nFor a random distribution of sizes, they present a non-periodic response to an\napplied magnetic field, with an extended linear regime and a sizable field\nsensitivity. Such properties make SQIFs interesting devices to detect the\nmagnetic component of electromagnetic waves at microwave frequencies. We have\nused the highly scalable technique of ion irradiation to make High Tc SQUIDs\nand SQIFs based on commercial YBa2Cu3O7 films, and studied their properties.\nBoth display optimum performances as a function of temperature and bias\ncurrent, that can be understood in the frame of numerical simulations that we\ndeveloped. The role of asymmetries and spread in JJ characteristics (routinely\nfound in HTSc technologies) is described : ion irradiation based devices appear\nrobust against them. We finally present results on SQIF made with 2000 SQUID in\nseries, showing a transfer function dV/dB ~ 1000V/T .\n", "  Aims. A summary of the CoRoT brown dwarf investigations are presented.\nMethods. Transiting brown dwarfs around solar like stars were studied by using\nthe photometric time-series of CoRoT, and ground based radial velocity\nmeasurements. Results. CoRoT detected three transiting brown dwarfs around F\nand G dwarf stars. The occurence rate of brown dwarfs was found to be 0.20 +/-\n0.15% around solar-like stars which is compatible with the value obtained by\nKepler-data.\n", "  In this work, and by means of micromagnetic simulations, we study the\nmagnetic properties of toroidal nanomagnets. The magnetization ground state for\ndifferent values of the aspect ratio between the toroidal and polar radii of\nthe nanotorus has been obtained. The hysteresis curves are also obtained,\nevidencing the existence of two reversal modes depending on the geometry: a\nvortex mode and a coherent rotation. A comparison between toroidal and\ncylindrical nanoparticles has been performed evidencing that nanotori can\naccommodate a vortex as the ground state for smaller volume than cylindrical\nnanorings. This is important because if vortices are used as bits of\ninformation, nanotori allow a higher density data storage.\n", "  We present \\emph{area (or entropy) functional relation} for multi-horizons\nfive dimensional (5D) Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS Black Hole. It has been\nobserved by exact and explicit calculation that some complicated function of\ntwo or three horizons area is \\emph{mass-independent} whereas the entropy\nproduct relation is \\emph{not} mass-independent. We also study the local\nthermodynamic stability of this black hole. The phase transition occurs at\ncertain condition. \\emph{Smarr mass formula} and \\emph{first law} of\nthermodynamics have been derived. This \\emph{mass-independent} relation\nsuggests they could turn out to be an \\emph{universal} quantity and further\nhelps us to understanding the nature of black hole entropy (both interior and\nexterior) at the microscopic level. In the \\emph{Appendix}, we have derived the\nthermodynamic products for 5D Einstein-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet black hole with\n\\emph{vanishing} cosmological constant.\n", "  A testbeam telescope, based on ATLAS IBL silicon pixel modules, has been\nbuilt. It comprises six planes of planar silicon sensors with 250 x 50 um^2\npitch, read out by ATLAS FE-I4 chips. In the CERN SPS H8 beamline (180 GeV pi+)\na resolution of better than 8 x 12 um^2 at the position of the device under\ntest was achieved. The telescope reached a trigger rate of 6kHz with two\nmeasured devices. It is mainly designed for studies using FE-I4 based\nprototypes, but has also been successfully run with independent DAQ systems.\nSpecialised trigger schemes ensure data synchronisation between these external\ndevices and the telescope. A region-of-interest trigger can be formed by\nsetting masks on the first and the last pixel sensor planes. The setup\ninfrastructure provides centrally controlled and monitored high and low voltage\npower supplies, silicon oil cooling, temperature and humidity sensors and\nmovable stages.\n", "  Active pixel sensors based on the High-Voltage CMOS technology are being\ninvestigated as a viable option for the future pixel tracker of the ATLAS\nexperiment at the High-Luminosity LHC. This paper reports on the testbeam\nmeasurements performed at the H8 beamline of the CERN Super Proton Synchrotron\non a High-Voltage CMOS sensor prototype produced in 180 nm AMS technology.\nResults in terms of tracking efficiency and timing performance, for different\nthreshold and bias conditions, are shown.\n", "  We show that properly engineered amorphous Fe-Gd alloy thin films with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy exhibit room-temperature skyrmion molecules,\nor a pair of like-polarity, opposite-helicity skyrmions. Magnetic mirror\nsymmetry planes present in the stripe phase, instead of chiral exchange,\ndetermine the internal skyrmion structure and the net achirality of the\nskyrmion phase. Our study shows that stripe domain engineering in amorphous\nalloy thin films may enable the creation of skyrmion phases with\ntechnologically desirable properties.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of optical pathways for formation of cold\nCa($^1$S)Na$^+$($^1$S) molecular ions via an intermediate state. The formation\nschemes are based on ab initio potential energy curves and transition dipole\nmoments calculated using effective-core-potential methods of quantum chemistry.\nIn the proposed approach, starting from a mixture of cold trapped Ca$^+$ ions\nimmersed into an ultracold gas of Na atoms, (NaCa)$^+$ molecular ions are\nphotoassociated in the excited E$^{1}\\Sigma^+$ electronic state and allowed to\nspontaneously decay either to the ground electronic state or an intermediate\nstate from which the population is transferred to the ground state via an\nadditional optical excitation. By analyzing all possible pathways, we find that\nthe efficiency of a two-photon scheme, via either B$^{1}\\Sigma^+$ or\nC$^{1}\\Sigma^+$ potential, is sufficient to produce significant quantities of\nground state (NaCa)$^+$ molecular ions. A single-step process results in lower\nformation rates that would require either a high density sample or a very\nintense photoassociation laser to be viable.\n", "  The gamma-ray decay of excited states of the one-valence-proton nucleus 133Sb\nhas been studied using cold-neutron induced fission of 235U and 241Pu targets,\nduring the EXILL campaign at the ILL reactor in Grenoble. By using a highly\nefficient HPGe array, coincidences between gamma-rays prompt with the fission\nevent and those delayed up to several tens of microseconds were investigated,\nallowing to observe, for the first time, high-spin excited states above the\n16.6 micros isomer. Lifetimes analysis, performed by fast-timing techniques\nwith LaBr3(Ce) scintillators, reveals a difference of almost two orders of\nmagnitude in B(M1) strength for transitions between positive-parity medium-spin\nyrast states. The data are interpreted by a newly developed microscopic model\nwhich takes into account couplings between core excitations (both collective\nand non-collective) of the doubly magic nucleus 132Sn and the valence proton,\nusing the Skyrme effective interaction in a consistent way. The results point\nto a fast change in the nature of particle-core excitations with increasing\nspin.\n", "  The single field chaotic inflation model with a monomial power greater than\none seems to be ruled out by the recent Planck and WMAP CMB data while\nStarobinsky model with a higher curvature term seems to be a viable model.\nHigher curvature terms being originated from quantum fluctuations, we revisit\nthe quantum cosmology of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the chaotic inflation\nmodel. The semiclassical cosmology emerges from quantum cosmology with\nfluctuations of spacetimes and matter when the wave function is peaked around\nthe semiclassical trajectory with quantum corrections a la the de Broglie-Bohm\npilot theory.\n", "  We used numerical modeling to study the evolution of EUV-induced plasmas in\nargon and hydrogen. The results of simulations were compared to the electron\ndensities measured by microwave cavity resonance spectroscopy. It was found\nthat the measured electron densities can be used to derive the integral amount\nof plasma in the cavity. However, in some regimes, the impact of the setup\ngeometry, EUV spectrum, and EUV induced secondary emission should be taken into\naccount. The influence of these parameters on the generated plasma and the\nmeasured electron density is discussed.\n", "  We study dilaton stabilization in heterotic string models. By utilizing the\nasymmetric orbifold construction, we construct an explicit three-generation\nmodel whose matter content in the visible sector is the supersymmetric standard\nmodel with additional vectorlike matter. This model does not contain any\ngeometric moduli fields except the dilaton field. Model building at a symmetry\nenhancement point in moduli space enlarges the rank of the hidden gauge group.\nBy analyzing multiple hidden gauge sectors, the dilaton field is stabilized by\nthe racetrack mechanism. We also discuss a supersymmetry breaking scenario and\nF-term uplifting.\n", "  Based on the Lagrangian of the steady axisymmetric force-free magnetosphere\n(FFM) equation around Kerr black holes(KBHs), we find that the FFM equation can\nbe rewritten in a new form as $f_{,rr} / (1-\\mu^{2}) + f_{,\\mu\\mu} / \\Delta +\nK(f(r,\\mu),r,\\mu) = 0$, where $\\mu = -\\cos\\theta$. By coordinate\ntransformation, the form of the above equation can be given by $s_{,yy} +\ns_{,zz} + D(s(y,z),y,z) = 0$. Based on the form, we prove finally that the\nMeissner effect is not possessed by a KBH-FFM with the condition where\n$d\\omega/d A_{\\phi} \\leqslant 0$ and $H_{\\phi}(dH_{\\phi}/dA_{\\phi}) \\geqslant\n0$, here $A_{\\phi}$ is the $\\phi$ component of the vector potential $\\vec{A}$,\n$\\omega$ is the angular velocity of magnetic fields and ${H_{\\phi}}$\ncorresponds to twice the poloidal electric current.\n", "  We analyse the scatter in the correlation between super-massive black hole\n(SMBH) mass and bulge stellar mass of the host galaxy, and infer that it cannot\nbe accounted for by mergers alone. The merger-only scenario, where small\ngalaxies merge to establish a proportionality relation between the SMBH and\nbulge masses, leads to a scatter around the linear proportionality line that\nincreases with the square root of the SMBH (or bulge) mass. By examining a\nsample of 103 galaxies we find that the intrinsic scatter increases more\nrapidly than expected from the merger-only scenario. The correlation between\nSMBH masses and their host galaxy properties is therefore more likely to be\ndetermined by a negative feedback mechanism that is driven by an active\ngalactic nucleus. We find a hint that some galaxies with missing stellar mass\nreside close to the centre of clusters and speculate that ram-pressure\nstripping of gas off the young galaxy as it moves near the cluster centre,\nmight explain the missing stellar mass at later times.\n", "  We propose a method of computing one-loop determinants in black hole\nspacetimes (with emphasis on asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes) that\nmay be used for numerics when completely-analytic results are unattainable. The\nmethod utilizes the expression for one-loop determinants in terms of\nquasinormal frequencies determined by Denef, Hartnoll and Sachdev in\n\\cite{Denef:2009kn}. A numerical evaluation must face the fact that the sum\nover the quasinormal modes, indexed by momentum and overtone numbers, is\ndivergent. A necessary ingredient is then a regularization scheme to handle the\ndivergent contributions of individual fixed-momentum sectors to the partition\nfunction. To this end, we formulate an effective two-dimensional problem in\nwhich a natural refinement of standard heat kernel techniques can be used to\naccount for contributions to the partition function at fixed momentum. We test\nour method in a concrete case by reproducing the scalar one-loop determinant in\nthe BTZ black hole background. We then discuss the application of such\ntechniques to more complicated spacetimes.\n", "  We study the BPS index for the four-dimensional rank-one N=2 superconformal\nfield theories H_0, H_1, H_2, E_6, E_7, E_8. We consider compactifications of\nthe E-string theory on T^2 in which these theories arise as low energy limits.\nUsing this realization we clarify the general structure of the BPS index. The\nindex is characterized by two exponents and a sequence of invariants. We\ndetermine the exponents and the first few invariants.\n", "  We present a comparative study of the glass forming ability of binary systems\nwith varying composition, where the systems have similar global crystalline\nstructure (CsCl+fcc). Biased Monte Carlo simulations using umbrella sampling\ntechnique shows that the free energy cost to create a CsCl nucleus increases as\nthe composition of the smaller particles are decreased. We find that the\nsystems with comparatively lower free energy cost to form CsCl nucleus exhibit\nmore pronounced pre-crystalline demixing near the liquid/crystal interface. The\nstructural frustration between the CsCl and fcc crystal demands this demixing.\nWe show that closer to the equimolar mixture the entropic penalty for demixing\nis lower and a glass forming system may crystallize spontaneously when seeded\nwith a nucleus. This entropic penalty as a function of composition shows a\nnon-monotonic behavior with a maximum at a composition similar to the well\nknown Kob-Anderson (KA) model. Although the KA model shows the maximum entropic\npenalty and thus maximum frustration against CsCl formation, it also shows a\nstrong tendency towards crystallization into fcc lattice of the larger \"A\"\nparticles which can be explained from the study of the energetics. Thus for\nsystems closer to the equimolar mixture although it is the requirement of\ndemixing which provides their stability against crystallization, for KA model\nit is not demixing but slow dynamics and structural frustration caused by the\nlocally favored structure around the smaller \"B\" particles which make it a good\nglass former. Although the glass forming binary systems studied here are quite\nsimilar, differing only in composition, we find that their glass forming\nability cannot be attributed to a single phenomena.\n", "  The IceCube collaboration has reported the first detection of high-energy\nastrophysical neutrinos including $\\sim 50$ high-energy starting events, but no\nindividual sources have been identified. It is therefore important to develop\nthe most sensitive and efficient possible algorithms to identify point sources\nof these neutrinos. The most popular current method works by exploring a dense\ngrid of possible directions to individual sources, and identifying the single\ndirection with the maximum probability of having produced multiple detected\nneutrinos. This method has numerous strengths, but it is computationally\nintensive and, because it focuses on the single best location for a point\nsource, additional point sources are not included in the evidence. We propose a\nnew maximum likelihood method that uses the angular separations between all\npairs of neutrinos in the data. Unlike existing autocorrelation methods for\nthis type of analysis, which also use angular separations between neutrino\npairs, our method incorporates information about the point spread function and\ncan identify individual point sources. We find that if the angular resolution\nis a few degrees or better, then this approach reduces both false positive and\nfalse negative errors compared to the current method, and is also more\ncomputationally efficient up to, potentially, hundreds of thousands of detected\nneutrinos.\n", "  We present a study of the network of relationships among elected members of\nthe Finnish parliament, based on a quantitative analysis of initiative\nco-signatures, and its evolution over 16 years. To understand the structure of\nthe parliament, we constructed a statistically validated network of members,\nbased on the similarity between the patterns of initiatives they signed. We\nlooked for communities within the network and characterized them in terms of\nmembers' attributes, such as electoral district and party. To gain insight on\nthe nested structure of communities, we constructed a hierarchical tree of\nmembers from the correlation matrix. Afterwards, we studied parliament dynamics\nyearly, with a focus on correlations within and between parties, by also\ndistinguishing between government and opposition. Finally, we investigated the\nrole played by specific individuals, at a local level. In particular, whether\nthey act as proponents who gather consensus, or as signers. Our results provide\na quantitative background to current theories in political science. From a\nmethodological point of view, our network approach has proven able to highlight\nboth local and global features of a complex social system.\n", "  The neutrino masses and mixings are studied in the model which is the\nsupersymmetric extension of the standard model with local gauged baryon and\nlepton numbers(BLMSSM). At tree level the neutrinos can obtain tiny masses\nthrough the See-Saw mechanism in the BLMSSM. The one-loop corrections to the\nneutrino masses and mixings are important, and they are studied in this work\nwith the mass insertion approximation. We study the numerical results and\ndiscuss the allowed parameter space of BLMSSM. It can contribute to study the\nneutrino masses and to explore the new physics beyond the standard model(SM).\n", "  The unconventional magnetoresistance of ZrSiS single crystals is found\nunsaturated till the magnetic field of 53 T with the butterfly shaped angular\ndependence. Intense Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations resolve a bulk Dirac cone\nwith a nontrivial Berry phase, where the Fermi surface area is 1.80*10^-3\n{\\AA}-2 and reaches the quantum limit before 20 T. Angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy measurement reveals an electronic state with the two-dimensional\nnature around the X point of Brillouin zone boundary. By integrating the\ndensity functional theory calculations, ZrSiS is suggested to be a Dirac\nmaterial with both surface and bulk Dirac bands.\n", "  PSR J1024$-$0719 is a millisecond pulsar that was long thought to be\nisolated. However, puzzling results concerning its velocity, distance, and low\nrotational period derivative have led to reexamination of its properties. We\npresent updated radio timing observations along with new and archival optical\ndata that show PSR J1024$-$0719 is most likely in a long period (2$-$20 kyr)\nbinary system with a low-mass ($\\approx 0.4\\,M_\\odot$) low-metallicity ($Z\n\\approx -0.9\\,$ dex) main sequence star. Such a system can explain most of the\nanomalous properties of this pulsar. We suggest that this system formed through\na dynamical exchange in a globular cluster that ejected it into a halo orbit,\nconsistent with the low observed metallicity for the stellar companion. Further\nastrometric and radio timing observations such as measurement of the third\nperiod derivative could strongly constrain the range of orbital parameters.\n", "  We introduce quantum correlations measures based on the minimal change in\nunified entropies induced by local rank-one projective measurements, divided by\na factor that depends on the generalized purity of the system in the case of\nnon-additive entropies. In this way, we overcome the issue of the artificial\nincreasing of the value of quantum correlations measures based on non-additive\nentropies when an uncorrelated ancilla is appended to the system without\nchanging the computability of our entropic correlations measures with respect\nto the previous ones. Moreover, we recover as limiting cases the quantum\ncorrelations measures based on von Neumann and R\\'enyi entropies (i.e.,\nadditive entropies), for which the adjustment factor becomes trivial. In\naddition, we distinguish between total and semiquantum correlations and obtain\nsome relations between them. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions of the\nentropic correlations measures for typical quantum bipartite systems.\n", "  We report the existence of Weyl points in a class of non-central symmetric\nmetamaterials, which has time reversal symmetry, but does not have inversion\nsymmetry due to chiral coupling between electric and magnetic fields. This\nclass of metamaterial exhibits either type-I or type-II Weyl points depending\non its non-local response. We also provide a physical realization of such\nmetamaterial consisting of an array of metal wires in the shape of elliptical\nhelixes which exhibits type-II Weyl points.\n", "  A method is presented for calibrating the higher eigenmodes (resonance modes)\nof atomic force microscopy cantilevers that can be performed prior to any\ntip-sample interaction. The method leverages recent efforts in accurately\ncalibrating the first eigenmode by providing the higher-mode stiffness as a\nratio to the first mode stiffness. A one-time calibration routine must be\nperformed for every cantilever type to determine the power-law relationship\nbetween stiffness and frequency, which is then stored for future use on similar\ncantilevers. Then, future calibrations only require a measurement of the ratio\nof resonance frequencies and the stiffness of the first mode. This method is\nverified through stiffness measurements using three independent approaches:\ninterferometric measurement, AC approach-curve calibration, and finite element\nanalysis simulation. Power-law values for calibrating higher-mode stiffnesses\nare reported for three popular multifrequency cantilevers. Once the higher-mode\nstiffnesses are known, the amplitude of each mode can also be calibrated from\nthe thermal spectrum by application of the equipartition theorem.\n", "  Alfv\\'en eigenmodes (AEs) and energetic particle modes (EPMs) are often\nexcited by energetic particles (EPs) in tokamak plasmas. One of the main open\nquestions concerning EP driven instabilities is the non-linear evolution of the\nmode structure. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the properties\nof beta-induced AEs (BAEs) and EP driven geodesic acoustic modes (EGAMs)\nobserved in the ramp-up phase of off-axis NBI heated ASDEX Upgrade (AUG)\ndischarges. This paper focuses on the changes in the mode structure of\nBAEs/EGAMs during the non-linear chirping phase. Our investigation has shown\nthat in case of the observed down-chirping BAEs the changes in the radial\nstructure are smaller than the uncertainty of our measurement. This behaviour\nis most probably the consequence of that BAEs are normal modes, thus their\nradial structure strongly depends on the background plasma parameters rather\nthan on the EP distribution. In the case of rapidly upward chirping EGAMs the\nanalysis consistently shows shrinkage of the mode structure. The proposed\nexplanation is that the resonance in the velocity space moves towards more\npassing particles which have narrower orbit widths.\n", "  The theory of elasticity (a.k.a. Riva-Cardy model) has been regarded as an\nexample of scale invariant but not conformal field theories. We argue that in\n$d=2$ dimensions, the theory has hidden global conformal symmetry of\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{R}) \\times SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ without its Virasoro extension. More\nprecisely, we can embed all the correlation functions of the displacement\nvector into a global conformal field theory with four-derivative action in\nterms of two scalar potential variables, which necessarily violates the\nreflection positivity. The energy-momentum tensor for the potential variables\ncannot be improved to become traceless so that it does not show the Virasoro\nsymmetry even with the existence of global special conformal current.\n", "  A directed graph (digraph) is formed by vertices and arcs (directed edges)\nfrom one vertex to another. A feedback vertex set (FVS) is a set of vertices\nthat contains at least one vertex of every directed cycle in this digraph. The\ndirected feedback vertex set problem aims at constructing a FVS of minimum\ncardinality. This is a fundamental cycle-constrained hard combinatorial\noptimization problem with wide practical applications. In this paper we\nconstruct a spin glass model for the directed FVS problem by converting the\nglobal cycle constraints into local arc constraints, and study this model\nthrough the replica-symmetric (RS) mean field theory of statistical physics. We\nthen implement a belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) algorithm for\nsingle digraph instances. The BPD algorithm slightly outperforms the simulated\nannealing algorithm on large random graph instances. The predictions of the RS\nmean field theory are noticeably lower than the BPD results, possibly due to\nits neglect of cycle-caused long range correlations.\n", "  Many models, in particular, the brane-world models with two branes, predict\nthe existence of the scalar radion, whose mass can be somewhat smaller than\nthose of all the Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton and Standard Model (SM)\nparticles. Due to its origin the radion interacts with the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the SM. The fermion part of the radion interaction\nLagrangian is different from that for the SM Higgs boson due to the presence of\nadditional terms playing a role for off-shell fermions. It was shown previously\nthat for the case of the single radion and single Higgs boson production\nprocesses in association with an arbitrary number of SM gauge bosons all the\ncontributions to the perturbative amplitudes appearing due to these additional\nterms were cancelled out making the processes similar up to a replacement of\nmasses and overall coupling constants. For the case of the associated Higgs\nboson-radion and the Higgs boson pair production processes involving the SM\ngauge bosons the similarity property also takes place. However a detailed\nconsideration shows that in this case it is not enough to replace simply the\nmasses and the constants ($m_h \\rightarrow m_r$ and $v \\rightarrow \\Lambda_r$).\nOne should also rescale the triple Higgs coupling by the factor $\\xi \\equiv 1 +\n\\frac{m_r^2 - m_h^2}{3m_h^2}$.\n", "  A gauge $U(1)$ family symmetry is proposed, spanning the quarks and leptons\nas well as particles of the dark sector. The breaking of $U(1)$ to $Z_2$\ndivides the two sectors and generates one-loop radiative masses for the first\ntwo families of quarks and leptons, as well as all three neutrinos. We study\nthe phenomenological implications of this new connection between family\nsymmetry and dark matter. In particular, a scalar or pseudoscalar particle\nassociated with this $U(1)$ breaking may be identified with the 750 GeV\ndiphoton resonance recently observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  We analyze the radiation pressure induced interaction of mirror motion and\nlight fields in Michelson-type interferometers used for the detection of\ngravitational waves and for fundamental research in table-top quantum\noptomechanical experiments, focusing on the asymmetric regime with a (slightly)\nunbalanced beamsplitter and a (small) offset from the dark port. This regime,\nas it was shown recently, provides new interesting features, in particular a\nstable optical spring and optical cooling on cavity resonance.\n  We show that generally the nature of optomechanical coupling in\nMichelson-type interferometers does not fit into the standard\ndispersive/dissipative dichotomy. In particular, a symmetric Michelson\ninterferometer with signal-recycling but without power-recycling cavity is\ncharacterized by a purely dissipative optomechanical coupling; only in the\npresence of asymmetry, additional dispersive coupling arises. In gravitational\nwaves detectors possessing signal- and power-recycling cavities, yet another,\n\"coherent\" type of optomechanical coupling takes place.\n  We develop here a generalized framework for the analysis of asymmetric\nMichelson-type interferometers which also covers the possibility of the\ninjection of carrier light into both ports of the interferometer. Using this\nframework, we analyze in depth the \"anomalous\" features of the Michelson-Sagnac\ninterferometer which where discussed and observed experimentally in previous\nworks [1-3].\n", "  Recently it has been claimed that the warm dark matter (WDM) model cannot at\nthe same time reproduce the observed Lyman-{\\alpha} forests in distant quasar\nspectra and solve the small-scale issues in the cold dark matter (CDM) model.\nAs an alternative candidate, it was shown that the mixed dark matter (MDM)\nmodel that consists of WDM and CDM can satisfy the constraint from\nLyman-{\\alpha} forests and account for the \"missing satellite problem\" as well\nas the reported 3.5 keV anomalous X-ray line. We investigate observational\nconstraints on the MDM model using strong gravitational lenses. We first\ndevelop a fitting formula for the nonlinear power spectra in the MDM model by\nperforming N-body simulations and estimate the expected perturbations caused by\nline-of-sight structures in four quadruply lensed quasars that show anomaly in\nthe flux ratios. Our analysis indicates that the MDM model is compatible with\nthe observed anomaly if the mass fraction of the warm component is smaller than\n0.47 at the 95% confidence level. The MDM explanation to the anomalous X-ray\nline and the small-scale issues is still viable even after this constraint is\ntaken into account.\n", "  We theoretically study the stability of more than one Majorana Fermion\nappearing in a $p$-wave superconductor/dirty normal metal/$p$-wave\nsuperconductor junction in two-dimension by using chiral symmetry of\nHamiltonian. At the phase difference across the junction $\\varphi$ being $\\pi$,\nwe will show that all of the Majorana bound states in the normal metal belong\nto the same chirality. Due to this pure chiral feature, the Majorana bound\nstates retain their high degree of degeneracy at the zero energy even in the\npresence of random potential. As a consequence, the resonant transmission of a\nCooper pair via the degenerate MBSs carries the Josephson current at\n$\\varphi=\\pi-0^+$, which explains the fractional current-phase relationship\ndiscussed in a number of previous papers.\n", "  This report deals with the preparation of a clean Ta(110) surface,\ninvestigated by means of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy as well as\nby low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy. The surface\ninitially exhibits a surface reconstruction induced by oxygen contamination.\nThis reconstruction can be removed by annealing at high temperatures under\nultrahigh vacuum conditions. The reconstruction-free surface reveals a surface\nresonance at a bias voltage of about -500 mV. The stages of the transformation\nare presented and discussed. In a next step, Fe islands were grown on top of\nTa(110) and investigated subsequently. An intermixing regime was identified for\nannealing temperatures of (550 - 590) K.\n", "  Electrokinetic transport phenomena can strongly influence the behaviour of\nmacromolecules and colloidal particles in solution, with applications in, e.g.,\nDNA translocation through nanopores, electro-osmotic flow in nanocapillaries,\nand electrophoresis of charged macromolecules. Numerical simulations are an\nimportant tool to investigate these electrokinetic phenomena, but are often\nplagued by spurious fluxes and spurious flows that can easily exceed physical\nfluxes and flows. Here, we present a method that reduces one of these spurious\ncurrents, spurious flow, by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness and generality of our method for both electrokinetic\nlattice-Boltzmann and finite-element-method based algorithms by simulating a\ncharged sphere in an electrolyte solution, and flow through a nanopore. We also\nshow that previous attempts to suppress these spurious currents introduce other\nsources of error.\n", "  \"Is entanglement monogamous?\" asks the title of a popular article [B. Terhal,\nIBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum\ninformation theory. While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense,\nthe situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative\nlimitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite\nsystem, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what\nit takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative\nmonogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class\nof entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the\nterm, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In\nparticular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement\nmeasure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the\nsame time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the\nfully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of\nsuch entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for\ndimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.\n", "  Jets of compact radio sources are highly relativistic and Doppler boosted,\nmaking studies of their intrinsic properties difficult. Observed brightness\ntemperatures can be used to study the intrinsic physical properties of the\nrelativistic jets, and constrain models of jet formation in the inner jet\nregion. We aim to observationally test such inner jet models. The very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) cores of compact radio sources are optically\nthick at a given frequency. The distance of the core from the central engine is\ninversely proportional to the frequency. Under the equipartition condition\nbetween the magnetic field energy and particle energy densities, the absolute\ndistance of the VLBI core can be predicted. We compiled the brightness\ntemperatures of VLBI cores at various radio frequencies of 2, 8, 15, and\n86~GHz. We derive the brightness temperature on sub-parsec scales in the rest\nframe of the compact radio sources. We find that the brightness temperature\nincreases with increasing distance from the central engine, indicating that the\nintrinsic jet speed (the Lorentz-factor) increases along the jet. This implies\nthat the jets are accelerated in the (sub-)parsec regions from the central\nengine.\n", "  Nonadiabatic quantum interferences emerge whenever nuclear wavefunctions in\ndifferent electronic states meet and interact in a nonadiabatic region. In this\nwork, we analyze how nonadiabatic quantum interferences translate in the\ncontext of the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction. In\nparticular, we focus our attention on the shape of the time-dependent potential\nenergy surface - the exact surface on which the nuclear dynamics takes place.\nWe use a one-dimensional exactly-solvable model to reproduce different\nconditions for quantum interferences, whose characteristic features already\nappear in one-dimension. The time-dependent potential energy surface develops\ncomplex features when strong interferences are present, in clear contrast to\nthe observed behavior in simple nonadiabatic crossing cases. Nevertheless,\nindependent classical trajectories propagated on the exact time-dependent\npotential energy surface reasonably conserve a distribution in configuration\nspace that mimics the one of the exact nuclear probability density.\n", "  In the braneworld scenario the zero mode gravitons are trapped on a brane due\nto non-linear warping effect, so that gravitational waves can reflect from the\nbrane walls. If the reflected waves form an interference pattern on the brane\nthen it can be detected on existing detectors due to spatial variations of\nintensity in the pattern. As an example we interpret the LIGO event GW150914 as\na manifestation of such interference pattern produced by the burst\ngravitational waves, emitted by a powerful source inside or outside the brane\nand reflected from the brane walls.\n", "  We develop a general classification of the infinite number of families of\nsolitons and soliton complexes in the one-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii/nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a nonlinear lattice\npseudopotential, i.e., periodically modulated coefficient in front of the cubic\nterm, which takes both positive and negative local values. This model finds\ndirect implementations in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear\noptics. The most essential finding is the existence of two branches of dipole\nsolitons (DSs), which feature an antisymmetric shape, essentially squeezed into\na single cell of the nonlinear lattice. This soliton species was not previously\nconsidered in nonlinear lattices. We demonstrate that one branch of the DS\nfamily (namely, the one which obeys the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion) is\nstable, while unstable DSs spontaneously transform into stable fundamental\nsolitons (FSs). The results are obtained in numerical and approximate\nanalytical forms, the latter based on the variational approximation. Some\nstable bound states of FSs are found too.\n", "  We consider a finite one-dimensional Heisenberg XYZ spin chain under the\ninfluence of dissipative Lindblad environment obeying the Born-Markovian\nconstrain in presence of an external magnetic field. We apply both closed and\nopen boundary conditions at zero and finite temperature. We present an exact\nnumerical solution for the Lindblad master equation of the system in the\nLiouville space. we find that, in the free spin chain (in absence of any\nenvironment), the entanglement at all ranges evolve in time in a non-uniform\noscillatory form that changes significantly depending on the initial state,\nsystem size and the spatial anisotropy. The oscillatory behavior is suppressed\nonce the system is coupled to the environment. Furthermore, the asymptotic\nbehavior of the entanglement, nearest neighbor and beyond, in the system under\nthe influence of the environment at zero temperature is very sensitive to the\nx-y spatial anisotropy, which causes them to reach either a zero or a finite\nsustainable steady state value regardless of the initial state of the system.\nThe anisotropy in the $z-$direction may enhance the entanglement depending on\nthe interplay with the magnetic field applied in the same direction. As the\ntemperature is raised, the steady state of the short range entanglements is\nfound to be robust within very small non-zero temperature range, which depends\ncritically on the spatial anisotropy of the system. The entanglement at each\nrange depends differently on the spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the end to end\nentanglement transfer time and speed through the open boundary chain vary\nsignificantly based on the degree of anisotropy and the temperature of the\nenvironment.\n", "  The electric field (EF) effect on the magnetic domain structure of a Pt/Co\nsystem was studied, where an EF was applied to the top surface of the Co layer.\nThe width of the maze domain was significantly modified by the application of\nthe EF at a temperature slightly below the Curie temperature. After a detailed\nanalysis, a change in the exchange stiffness induced by the EF application was\nsuggested to dominate the modulation of the domain width observed in the\nexperiment. The accumulation of electrons at the surface of the Co layer\nresulted in an increase of the exchange stiffness and the Curie temperature.\nThe result was consistent with the recent theoretical prediction.\n", "  The two-stream instability is probably the most important elementary example\nof collective instabilities in plasma physics and beam-plasma systems. For a\nwarm plasma with two charged particle species based on a 1D warm-fluid model,\nthe instability diagram of the two-stream instability exhibits an interesting\nband structure that has not been explained. We show that the band structure for\nthis instability is the consequence of the Hamiltonian nature of the warm\ntwo-fluid system. Interestingly, the Hamiltonian nature manifests as a complex\nG-Hamiltonian structure in wave-number space, which directly determines the\ninstability diagram. Specifically, it is shown that the boundaries between the\nstable and unstable regions are locations for Krein collisions between\neigenmodes with different Krein signatures. In terms of physics, this\nrigorously implies that the system is destabilized when a positive-action mode\nresonates with a negative-action mode, and that this is the only mechanism by\nwhich the system can be destabilized. It is anticipated that this physical\nmechanism of destabilization is valid for other collective instabilities in\nconservative systems in plasma physics, accelerator physics, and fluid dynamics\nsystems, which admit infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian structures.\n", "  Primordial dark matter (DM) haloes are the smallest gravitationally bound DM\nstructures from which the first stars, black holes, and galaxies form and grow\nin the early universe. However, their structures are sensitive to the free\nstreaming scale of DM, which in turn depends on the nature of DM particles. In\nthis work, we test the hypothesis that the slope of the central cusps in\nprimordial DM haloes near the free streaming scale depends on the nature of\nmerging process. By combining and analysing data from a cosmological simulation\nwith the cutoff in the small-scale matter power spectrum as well as a suite of\ncontrolled, high-resolution simulations of binary mergers, we find that (1) the\nprimordial DM haloes form preferentially through major mergers in radial\norbits; (2) their central DM density profile is more susceptible to a merging\nprocess compared to that of galaxy and cluster-size DM haloes; (3) consecutive\nmajor mergers drive the central density slope to approach the {\\it universal}\nform characterized by the NFW profile, which is shown to be robust to the\nimpacts of mergers and serves an attractor solution for the density structure\nof DM haloes. Our work highlights the importance of dynamical processes on the\nstructure formation during the Dark Ages.\n", "  Violating the strong constraint of double field theory, non-geometric fluxes\nwere argued to give rise to noncommutative/nonassociative structures. We derive\nin a rather pedestrian physicist way a differential geometry on the simplest\nnonassociative (phase-)space arising for a constant non-geometric R-flux. This\nprovides a complementary presentation to the quasi-Hopf representation\ncategorial one delivered by Barnes, Schenkel, Szabo in\narXiv:1409.6331+1507.02792. As there, the notions of tensors, covariant\nderivative, torsion and curvature find a star-generalization. We continue the\nconstruction with the introduction of a star-metric and its star-inverse where,\ndue to the nonassociativity, we encounter major deviations from the familiar\nstructure. Comments on the Levi-Civita connection, a star-Einstein-Hilbert\naction and the relation to string theory are included, as well.\n", "  The rapid developments of computational quantum chemistry methods and\nsupercomputing facilities motivate the renewed interest in the analysis of the\nmuon/electron interactions in $\\mu$SR experiments with \\emph{ab initio}\napproaches. Modern simulation methods seem to be able to provide the answers to\nthe frequently asked questions of many $\\mu$SR experiments: where is the muon?\nIs it a passive probe? What are the interaction parameters governing the\nmuon-sample interaction? In this review we describe some of the approaches used\nto provide quantitative estimations of the aforementioned quantities and we\nprovide the reader with a short discussion on the current developments in this\nfield.\n", "  The possibility to inject a single electron into ballistic conductors is at\nthe basis of the new field of electron quantum optics. Here, we consider a\nsingle electron injection into the helical edge channels of a topological\ninsulator. Their counterpropagating nature and the unavoidable presence of\nelectron-electron interactions dramatically affect the time evolution of the\nsingle wavepacket. Modeling the injection process from a mesoscopic capacitor\nin presence of non-local tunneling, we focus on the time resolved charge and\nenergy packet dynamics. Both quantities split up into counterpropagating\ncontributions whose profiles are strongly affected by the interactions\nstrength. In addition, stronger signatures are found for the injected energy,\nwhich is also affected by the finite width of the tunneling region. Indeed, the\nenergy flow can be controlled by tuning the injection parameters and we\ndemonstrate that, in presence of non-local tunneling, it is possible to achieve\nsituation in which charge and energy flow in opposite directions.\n", "  We present new results of fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic\nsimulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed with the Whisky\ncode. All the models use a piecewise polytropic approximation of the APR4\nequation of state for cold matter, together with a 'hybrid' part to incorporate\nthermal effects during the evolution. We consider both equal and unequal-mass\nmodels, with total masses such that either a supramassive NS or a black hole is\nformed after merger. Each model is evolved with and without a magnetic field\ninitially confined to the stellar interior. We present the different\ngravitational wave (GW) signals as well as a detailed description of the matter\ndynamics (magnetic field evolution, ejected mass, post-merger remnant/disk\nproperties). Our simulations provide new insights into BNS mergers, the\nassociated GW emission and the possible connection with the engine of short\ngamma-ray bursts (both in the 'standard' and in the 'time-reversal' scenarios)\nand other electromagnetic counterparts.\n", "  Glasses prepared by physical vapour deposition have been shown to be\nremarkably more stable than those prepared by standard cooling protocols, with\nproperties that appear to be similar to systems aged for extremely long times.\nWhen subjected to a rapid rise in temperature, ultrastable glasses anneal\ntowards the liquid in a qualitatively different manner than ordinary glasses,\nwith the seeming competition of different timescales and lengthscales. We\nnumerically reproduce the phenomenology of ultrastable glass annealing with a\nkinetically constrained model, a three dimensional East model with soft\nconstraints, in a setting where the bulk is in an ultrastable configuration and\na free surface is permanently excited. Annealing towards the liquid state is\ngiven by the competition between the ballistic propagation of a front from the\nfree surface and a much slower nucleation-like relaxation in the bulk. The\ncrossover between these mechanisms also explains the change in behaviour with\nfilm thickness seen experimentally.\n", "  In most of the realistic ab initio and model calculations which have appeared\non the emission of light from Si nanocrystals, the role of surface oxygen has\nbeen usually ignored, underestimated or completely ruled out. We investigate\ntheoretically, by density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) possible modes of\noxygen bonding in hydrogen terminated silicon quantum dots using as a\nrepresentative case of the Si29 nanocrystal. We have considered Bridge-bonded\noxygen (BBO), Doubly-bonded oxygen (DBO), hydroxyl (OH) and Mix of these\noxidizing agents. Due to stoichiometry, all comparisons performed are unbiased\nwith respect to composition whereas spatial distribution of oxygen species\npointed out drastic change in electronic and cohesive characteristics of\nnanocrytals. From an overall perspective of this study, it is shown that bridge\nbonded oxygenated nanocrystals accompanied by Mix have higher binding energies\nand large electronic gap compared to nanocrystals with doubly bonded oxygen\natoms. In addition, it is observed that the presence of OH along with BBO, DBO\nand mixed configurations further lowers electronic gaps and binding energies\nand trends. It is also demonstrated that oxidizing constituent besides their\nspatial distribution significantly alters binding energy and highest occupied\nmolecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap\n(HOMO-LUMO gap up to 1.48 eV) within same composition.\n", "  We report the discovery of an envelope Hamiltonian describing the\ncharged-particle dynamics in general linear coupled lattices.\n", "  It is generally believed that the semiclassical AdS$_3$ higher spin gravity\ncould be described by a two dimensional conformal field theory with\n${\\cal{W}}$-algebra symmetry in the large central charge limit. In this paper,\nwe study the single interval entanglement entropy on the torus in the CFT with\na ${\\cW}_3$ deformation. More generally we develop the monodromy analysis to\ncompute the two-point function of the light operators under a thermal density\nmatrix with a ${\\cW}_3$ chemical potential to the leading order.\nHolographically we compute the probe action of the Wilson line in the\nbackground of the spin-3 black hole with a chemical potential. We find exact\nagreement.\n", "  In this paper, we present a study of supercooled liquids interacting with the\nLennard Jones (LJ) potential and the corresponding purely repulsive\n(Weeks-Chandler-Andersen or WCA) potential, over a range of densities and\ntemperatures, in order to understand the origin of their different dynamics in\nspite of their structures being similar. Using the configurational entropy as\nthe thermodynamic marker via the Adam Gibbs (AG) relation, we show that the\ndifference in the dynamics of these two systems at low temperatures can be\nexplained from thermodynamics. At higher densities both the thermodynamical and\ndynamical difference between these model systems decrease, which is\nquantitatively demonstrated in this paper by calculating different parameters.\nThe study also reveals the origin of the difference in pair entropy despite the\nsimilarity in the structure. Although the maximum difference in structure is\nobtained in the partial radial distribution function (rdf) of the B type of\nparticles, the rdf of AA pairs and AB pairs give rise to the differences in the\nentropy and dynamics. This work supports the observation made in an earlier\nstudy (Phys. Rev. Lett.,\\textbf {113}, 225701, 2014) and shows that they are\ngeneric in nature, independent of density.\n", "  We report a detailed study of the magnetic properties of\nCeCo$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$Si under high magnetic fields (up to 16 Tesla)\nmeasuring different physical properties such as specific heat, magnetization,\nelectrical resistivity, thermal expansion and magnetostriction.\nCeCo$_{0.85}$Fe$_{0.15}$Si becomes antiferromagnetic at $T_N \\approx$ 6.7 K.\nHowever, a broad tail (onset at $T_X \\approx$ 13 K) in the specific heat\nprecedes that second order transition. This tail is also observed in the\ntemperature derivative of the resistivity. However, it is particularly\nnoticeable in the thermal expansion coefficient where it takes the form of a\nlarge bump centered at $T_X$. A high magnetic field practically washes out that\ntail in the resistivity. But surprisingly, the bump in the thermal expansion\nbecomes a well pronounced peak fully split from the magnetic transition at\n$T_N$. Concurrently, the magnetoresistance also switches from negative to\npositive just below $T_X$. The magnetostriction is considerable and\nirreversible at low temperature ($\\frac {\\Delta L}{L} \\left(16 T\\right) \\sim$\n4$\\times$10$^{-4}$ at 2 K) when the magnetic interactions dominate. A broad\njump in the field dependence of the magnetostriction observed at low $T$ may be\nthe signature of a weak ongoing metamagnetic transition. Taking altogether, the\nresults indicate the importance of the lattice effects in the development of\nthe magnetic order in these alloys.\n", "  The recent detection of the binary black hole merger GW150914 demonstrates\nthe existence of black holes more massive than previously observed in X-ray\nbinaries in our Galaxy. This article explores different scenarios of black hole\nformation in the context of self-consistent cosmic chemical evolution models\nthat simultaneously match observations of the cosmic star formation rate,\noptical depth to reionization and metallicity of the interstellar medium. This\nframework is used to calculate the mass distribution of merging black hole\nbinaries and its evolution with redshift. We also study the implications of the\nblack hole mass distribution for the stochastic gravitational wave background\nfrom mergers and from core collapse events.\n", "  3D printing of plastics, ceramics, and metals has existed for several decades\nand has revolutionized many areas of manufacturing and science. Printing of\nmetals in particular has found a number of applications in fields as diverse as\ncustomized medical implants, jet engine bearings, and rapid prototyping in the\nautomotive industry. Whilst many techniques can be used for 3D printing metals,\nthey commonly rely on computer controlled melting or sintering of a metal alloy\npowder using a laser or electron beam. The mechanical properties of parts\nproduced in such a way have been well studied, but little attention has been\npaid to their electrical properties. Here we show that a microwave cavity\n(resonant frequencies 9.9 and 11.2 GHz) 3D printed using an Al-12Si alloy\nexhibits superconductivity when cooled below the critical temperature of\naluminium (1.2 K), with a performance comparable to the common 6061 alloy of\naluminium. Superconducting cavities find application in numerous areas of\nphysics, from particle accelerators to cavity quantum electrodynamics\nexperiments. The result is achieved even with a very large concentration of\nnon-superconducting silicon in the alloy of 12.18%, compared to Al-6061, which\nhas between 0.4 to 0.8%. Our results may pave the way for the possibility of 3D\nprinting superconducting cavity configurations that are otherwise impossible to\nmachine.\n", "  I revisit a basic question about the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory: if it\nexists or not, or more precisely, whether a nonperturbative formulation exists.\nAs the most promising approach, I consider a formulation based on matrix\nmodels. It is explained that the existence of the noncommutative Yang-Mills\ntheory is closely related to the Eguchi-Kawai equivalence. I argue that\nsupersymmetric noncommutative Yang-Mills theory can be defined\nstraightforwardly. Non-supersymmetric theories, such as QCD and pure bosonic\ntheories, can presumably be defined, by modifying the ultraviolet and infrared\nbehaviors appropriately.\n", "  We study photonic signatures of symmetry broken and topological phases in a\ndriven, dissipative circuit QED realization of spin-1/2 chains. Specifically,\nwe consider the transverse-field XY model and a dual model with 3-spin\ninteractions. The former has a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase, while\nthe latter features, in addition, a symmetry protected topological phase. Using\nthe method of third quantization, we calculate the non-equilibrium steady-state\nof the open spin chains for arbitrary system sizes and temperatures. We find\nthat the bi-local correlation function of the spins at both ends of the chain\nprovides a sensitive measure for both symmetry-breaking and topological phase\ntransitions of the systems, but no universal means to distinguish between the\ntwo types of transitions. Both models have equivalent representations in terms\nof free Majorana fermions, which host zero, one and two topological Majorana\nend modes in the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and symmetry protected\ntopological phases, respectively. The correlation function we study retains its\nbi-local character in the fermionic representation, so that our results are\nequally applicable to the fermionic models in their own right. We propose a\nphotonic realization of the dissipative transverse-field XY model in a tunable\nsetup, where an array of superconducting transmon qubits is coupled at both\nends to a photonic microwave circuit.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize the original majority-vote (MV) model with noise\nfrom two states to arbitrary $q$ states, where $q$ is an integer no less than\ntwo. The main emphasis is paid to the comparison on the nature of phase\ntransitions between the two-state MV (MV2) model and the three-state MV (MV3)\nmodel. By extensive Monte Carlo simulation and mean-field analysis, we find\nthat the MV3 model undergoes a discontinuous order-disorder phase transition,\nin contrast to a continuous phase transition in the MV2 model. A central\nfeature of such a discontinuous transition is a strong hysteresis behavior as\nnoise intensity goes forward and backward. Within the hysteresis region, the\ndisordered phase and ordered phase are coexisting.\n", "  Berry phase is revealed for circularly polarized light when it is\nBragg-reflected by a chiral liquid crystal medium of the same handedness. By\nusing a chiral nematic layer we demonstrate that if the input plane of the\nlayer is rotated with respect to a fixed reference frame, then, a geometric\nphase effect occurs for the circularly polarized light reflected by the\nperiodic helical structure of the medium. Theory and numerical simulations are\nsupported by an experimental observation, disclosing novel applications in the\nfield of optical manipulation and fundamental optical phenomena.\n", "  We evaluate the proposed resonant terahertz (THz) detectors on the base of\nfield-effect transistors (FETs) with split gates, electrically induced lateral\np-n junctions, uniform graphene layer (GL) or perforated (in the p-n junction\ndepletion region) graphene layer (PGL) channel. The perforated depletion region\nforms an array of the nanoconstions or nanoribbons creating the barriers for\nthe holes and electrons. The operation of the GL-FET- and PGL-FET detectors is\nassociated with the rectification of the ac current across the lateral p-n\njunction enhanced by the excitation of bound plasmonic oscillations in in the\np- and n-sections of the channel. Using the developed device model, we find the\nGL-FET and PGL-FET-detectors characteristics. These detectors can exhibit very\nhigh voltage responsivity at the THz radiation frequencies close to the\nfrequencies of the plasmonic resonances. These frequencies can be effectively\nvoltage tuned. We show that in PL-FET-detectors the dominant mechanism of the\ncurrent rectification is due to the tunneling nonlinearity, whereas in\nPGL-FET-detector the current rectification is primarily associated with the\nthermionic processes. Due to much lower p-n junction conductance in the\nPGL-FET-detectors, their resonant response can be substantially more pronounced\nthan in the GL-FET-detectors corresponding to fairly high detector\nresponsivity.\n", "  We analyze the equation of state of 2+1 flavor lattice QCD at zero baryon\ndensity by constructing the simple quark-hadron hybrid model that has both\nquark and hadron components simultaneously. We calculate hadron and quark\ncontribution separately and parameterizing those to match with LQCD data.\nLattice data on the equation of state are decomposed into hadron and quark\ncomponents by using the model. The transition temperature is defined by the\ntemperature at which the hadron component is equal to the quark one in the\nequation of state. The transition temperature thus obtained is about 215 MeV\nand somewhat higher than the chiral and the deconfinement pseudocritical\ntemperatures defined by the temperature at which the susceptibility or the\nabsolute value of the derivative of the order parameter with respect to\ntemperature becomes maximum.\n", "  We consider holographic theories in bulk $(d+1)$-dimensions with Lifshitz and\nhyperscaling violating exponents $z,\\theta$ at finite temperature. By studying\nshear gravitational modes in the near-horizon region given certain\nself-consistent approximations, we obtain the corresponding shear diffusion\nconstant on an appropriately defined stretched horizon, adapting the analysis\nof Kovtun, Son and Starinets. For generic exponents with $d-z-\\theta>-1$, we\nfind that the diffusion constant has power law scaling with the temperature,\nmotivating us to guess a universal relation for the viscosity bound. When the\nexponents satisfy $d-z-\\theta=-1$, we find logarithmic behaviour. This relation\nis equivalent to $z=2+d_{eff}$ where $d_{eff}=d_i-\\theta$ is the effective\nboundary spatial dimension (and $d_i=d-1$ the actual spatial dimension). It is\nsatisfied by the exponents in hyperscaling violating theories arising from null\nreductions of highly boosted black branes, and we comment on the corresponding\nanalysis in that context.\n", "  Dissipation inevitably occurs in first order phase transitions, leading to\nthe irreversible heating. Conversely, the irreversible heating effect could be\na clue for the first order phase transition. We measured the temperature change\nat the magnetic-field-induced alpha-theta phase transition of solid oxygen. The\nsignificant temperature increase from 13 to 37 K, amounting to 700 J/mol, is\nobserved due to the irreversible heating at the first order phase transition.\nWe argue that the hysteresis loss of the magnetization curve and the\ndissipative structural transformation account for the irreversible heating. The\nmeasurement of the irreversible heating can be utilized for detecting the\nfirst-order phase transition in good combination with the ultrahigh magnetic\nfields generated in microseconds.\n", "  Compact binary coalescences are a promising source of gravitational waves for\nsecond-generation interferometric gravitational-wave detectors such as advanced\nLIGO and advanced Virgo. These are among the most promising sources for joint\ndetection of electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. To\nmaximize the science performed with these objects, it is essential to undertake\na followup observing strategy that maximizes the likelihood of detecting the EM\ncounterpart. We present a follow-up strategy that maximizes the counterpart\ndetection probability, given a fixed investment of telescope time. We show how\nthe prior assumption on the luminosity function of the electro-magnetic\ncounterpart impacts the optimized followup strategy. Our results suggest that\nif the goal is to detect an EM counterpart from among a succession of GW\ntriggers, the optimal strategy is to perform long integrations in the highest\nlikelihood regions, with a time investment that is proportional to the $2/3$\npower of the surface density of the GW location probability on the sky. In the\nfuture, this analysis framework will benefit significantly from the\n3-dimensional localization probability.\n", "  The South Pole Telescope has discovered one hundred gravitationally lensed,\nhigh-redshift, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We present 0.5\" resolution\n870um Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47\nDSFGs spanning z=1.9-5.7, and construct gravitational lens models of these\nsources. Our visibility-based lens modeling incorporates several sources of\nresidual interferometric calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly\naccount for noise in the observations. At least 70% of the sources are strongly\nlensed by foreground galaxies (mu_870um > 2), with a median magnification\nmu_870um = 6.3, extending to mu_870um > 30. We compare the intrinsic size\ndistribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number of unlensed\nDSFGs and find no significant differences in spite of a bias between the\nmagnification and intrinsic source size. This may indicate that the true size\ndistribution of DSFGs is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to\nconstrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this\nwavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads\nto discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of 2 compared to estimates\nusing a single value for this wavelength. We investigate the relationship\nbetween the [CII] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same\ncorrelation between the [CII]L_FIR ratio and Sigma_FIR found for low-redshift\nstar-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift galaxies and extends at least\ntwo orders of magnitude higher in Sigma_FIR. This lends further credence to the\nclaim that the compactness of the IR-emitting region is the controlling\nparameter in establishing the \"[CII] deficit.\"\n", "  In a composite model of the weak bosons the p-wave bosons are studied. The\nstate with the lowest mass is identified with the boson, which has been\ndiscovered at the LHC. Specific properties of the excited bosons are discussed,\nin particular their decays into weak bosons and photons. Recently a two photon\nsignal has been observed, which might come from the decay of a neutral heavy\nboson with a mass of about 0.75 TeV. This particle could be an excited weak\ntensor boson.\n", "  Electron density irregularities in the ionosphere are known to be\nmagnetically anisotropic, preferentially elongated along the lines of force.\nWhile many studies of their morphology have been undertaken by topside sounding\nand whistler measurements, it is only recently that detailed regional-scale\nreconstructions have become possible, enabled by the advent of widefield radio\ntelescopes. Here we present a new approach for visualising and studying\nfield-aligned irregularities (FAIs), which involves transforming\ninterferometric measurements of TEC gradients onto a magnetic shell tangent\nplane. This removes the perspective distortion associated with the oblique\nviewing angle of the irregularities from the ground, facilitating the\ndecomposition of dynamics along and across magnetic field lines. We apply this\ntransformation to the dataset of Loi et al. [2015a], obtained on 15 October\n2013 by the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio telescope and displaying\nprominent FAIs. We study these FAIs in the new reference frame, quantifying\nfield-aligned and field-transverse behaviour, examining time and altitude\ndependencies, and extending the analysis to FAIs on sub-array scales. We show\nthat the inclination of the plane can be derived solely from the data, and\nverify that the best-fit value is consistent with the known magnetic\ninclination. The ability of the model to concentrate the fluctuations along a\nsingle spatial direction may find practical application to future calibration\nstrategies for widefield interferometry, by providing a compact representation\nof FAI-induced distortions.\n", "  Ultrafast electrical switching by current-induced staggered spin-orbit\nfields, with minimal risk of overshoot, is shown in layered easy-plane\nantiferromagnets with basal-plane biaxial anisotropy. The reliable switching is\ndue to the field-like torque, relaxing stringent requirements with respect to\nprecision in the time-duration of the excitation pulse. We investigate the\nswitching characteristics as a function of the spin-orbit field strength, pulse\nduration, pulse rise and fall time and damping by atomistic spin dynamics\nsimulations and an effective equation of motion for the antiferromagnetic\norder-parameter. The condition, determining the critical spin-orbit field\nstrength for switching is determined and we go on to show that robust\npicosecond writing is possible at feasible current magnitudes.\n", "  We present results of pointed X-ray observations of the accreting jet-driving\nT Tauri star RY Tau using Chandra and XMM-Newton. We obtained high-resolution\ngrating spectra and excellent-quality CCD spectra and light curves with the\nobjective of identifying the physical mechanisms underlying RY Tau's bright\nX-ray emission. Grating spectra reveal numerous emission lines spanning a broad\nrange of temperature superimposed on a hot continuum. The X-ray emission\nmeasure distribution is dominated by very hot plasma at T_hot ~ 50 MK but\nhigher temperatures were present during flares. A weaker cool plasma component\nis also present as revealed by low-temperature lines such as O VIII. X-ray\nlight curves show complex variability consisting of short-duration (~hours)\nsuperhot flares accompanied by fluorescent Fe emission at 6.4 keV superimposed\non a slowly-varying (~one day) component that may be tied to stellar rotation.\nThe hot flaring component is undoubtedly of magnetic (e.g. coronal) origin.\nSoft and hard-band light curves undergo similar slow variability implying that\nat least some of the cool plasma shares a common magnetic origin with the hot\nplasma. Any contribution to the X-ray emission from cool shocked plasma is\nsmall compared to the dominant hot component but production of individual\nlow-temperature lines such as O VIII in an accretion shock is not ruled out.\n", "  The electrical response of two-dimensional electron gas to vibrations of a\nnanomechanical cantilever containing it is studied. Vibrations of\nperpendicularly oriented cantilevers are experimentally shown to change\noppositely the conductivity near their bases. This indicates the piezoelectric\nnature of electromechanical coupling. A physical model is developed, which\nquantitatively explains the experiment. It shows that the main origin of the\nconductivity change is a rapid change in the mechanical stress on the boundary\nbetween suspended and non-suspended areas, rather than the stress itself.\n", "  We perform a detailed analysis of the synchrotron signals produced by Dark\nMatter annihilations and decays. We consider different set-ups for the\npropagation of electrons and positrons, the galactic magnetic field and Dark\nMatter properties. We then confront these signals with radio and microwave\nmaps, including Planck measurements, from a frequency of 22 MHz up to 70 GHz.\nWe derive two sets of constraints: conservative and progressive, the latter\nbased on a modeling of the astrophysical emission. Radio and microwave\nconstraints are complementary to those obtained with other indirect detection\nmethods, especially for dark matter annihilating into leptonic channels.\n", "  We present a generator-coordinate calculation, based on a relativistic\nenergy-density functional, of the low-lying spectra in the isotopes $^{150}$Nd\nand $^{150}$Sm and of the nuclear matrix element that governs the neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay of the first isotope to the second. We carefully examine the\nimpact of octupole correlations on both nuclear structure and the double-beta\ndecay matrix element. Octupole correlations turn out to reduce quadrupole\ncollectivity in both nuclei. Shape fluctuations, however, dilute the effects of\noctupole deformation on the double-beta decay matrix element, so that the\noverall octupole-induced quenching is only about 7\\%.\n", "  We study non-equilibrium processes in an isolated quantum system ---the Dicke\nmodel--- focusing on the role played by the transition from integrability to\nchaos and the presence of excited-state quantum phase transitions. We show that\nboth diagonal and entanglement entropies are abruptly increased by the onset of\nchaos. Also, this increase ends in both cases just after the system crosses the\ncritical energy of the excited-state quantum phase transition. The link between\nentropy production, the development of chaos and the excited-state quantum\nphase transition is more clear for the entanglement entropy. On the contrary,\nthe heat dissipated by the process is affected neither by the onset of chaos,\nnor by the excited-state quantum phase transition.\n", "  Binary stars and higher-order multiple systems are an ubiquitous outcome of\nstar formation, especially as the system mass increases. The companion\nmass-ratio distribution is a unique probe into the conditions of the collapsing\ncloud core and circumstellar disk(s) of the binary fragments. Inside $a \\sim\n1000$ AU the disks from the two forming stars can interact, and additionally\ncompanions can form directly through disk fragmentation. We should therefore\nexpect the mass-ratio distribution of close companions ($a \\lesssim 100$ AU) to\ndiffer from that of wide companions. This prediction is difficult to test using\ntraditional methods, especially with intermediate-mass primary stars, for a\nvariety of observational reasons. We present the results of a survey searching\nfor companions to A- and B-type stars using the direct spectral detection\nmethod, which is sensitive to late-type companions within $\\sim 1\"$ of the\nprimary and which has no inner working angle. We estimate the temperatures and\nsurface gravity of most of the 341 sample stars, and derive their masses and\nages. We additionally estimate the temperatures and masses of the 64 companions\nwe find, 23 of which are new detections. We find that the mass-ratio\ndistribution for our sample has a maximum near $q \\sim 0.3$. Our mass-ratio\ndistribution has a very different form than in previous work, where it is\nusually well-described by a power law, and indicates that close companions to\nintermediate-mass stars experience significantly different accretion histories\nor formation mechanisms than wide companions.\n", "  When a high-contrast ultra-relativistic laser beam enters a micro-sized\nplasma waveguide, the pulse energy is coupled into waveguide modes, which\nremarkably modifies the interaction of electrons and electromagnetic wave. The\nelectrons that pulled out of walls form a dense helical bunch inside the\nchannel are efficiently accelerated by the transverse magnetic modes to\nhundreds of MeVs. In the mean time, the asymmetry in the transverse electric\nand magnetic fields provides significant wiggling that leads to a bright,\nwell-collimated emission of hard X-rays. In this paper, we present our study on\nthe underlying physics in the aforementioned process using 3D particle-in-cell\nsimulations. The mechanism of electron acceleration and the dependence of\nradiation properties on different laser plasma parameters are addressed. A\ntheoretical analysis model and basic scalings for X-ray emission are also\npresented by considering the lowest optical modes in the waveguide, which is\nadequate to describe the basic observed phenomenon. In addition, the effects of\nhigh order modes as well as laser polarization are also qualitatively\ndiscussed. The considered X-ray source have promising features that might serve\nas a competitive candidate for future tabletop synchrotron source.\n", "  We present near and mid-infrared interferometric observations made with the\nKeck Interferometer Nuller and near-contemporaneous spectro-photometry from the\nIRTF of 11 well known young stellar objects, several observed for the first\ntime in these spectral and spatial resolution regimes. With AU-level spatial\nresolution, we first establish characteristic sizes of the infrared emission\nusing a simple geometrical model consisting of a hot inner rim and mid-infrared\ndisk emission. We find a high degree of correlation between the stellar\nluminosity and the mid-infrared disk sizes after using near-infrared data to\nremove the contribution from the inner rim. We then use a semi-analytical\nphysical model to also find that the very widely used \"star + inner dust rim +\nflared disk\" class of models strongly fails to reproduce the SED and\nspatially-resolved mid-infrared data simultaneously; specifically a more\ncompact source of mid-infrared emission is required than results from the\nstandard flared disk model. We explore the viability of a modification to the\nmodel whereby a second dust rim containing smaller dust grains is added, and\nfind that the two-rim model leads to significantly improved fits in most cases.\nThis complexity is largely missed when carrying out SED modelling alone,\nalthough detailed silicate feature fitting by McClure et al. 2013 recently came\nto a similar conclusion. As has been suggested recently by Menu et al. 2015,\nthe difficulty in predicting mid-infrared sizes from the SED alone might hint\nat \"transition disk\"-like gaps in the inner AU; however, the relatively high\ncorrelation found in our mid-infrared disk size vs. stellar luminosity relation\nfavors layered disk morphologies and points to missing disk model ingredients\ninstead.\n", "  We report Raman light scattering in the phase separated superconducting\nsingle crystal Rb0.77Fe1.61Se2 with Tc = 32 K. The spectra have been measured\nin a wide temperature range 3K -500K. The observed phonon lines from the\nmajority vacancy ordered Rb2Fe4Se5 (245) antiferromagnetic phase with TN= 525 K\ndemonstrate modest anomalies in frequency, intensity and halfwidth at the\nsuperconductive phase transition. We identify phonon lines from the minority\ncompressed Rb{\\delta}Fe2Se2 (122) conductive phase. The superconducting gap\nwith dx2-y2 symmetry is also detected in our spectra. In the range 0-600 cm-1\nwe observed the low intensive but highly polarized B1g-type background which\nbecomes well structured under cooling. The possible magnetic or multiorbital\norigin of this background has been discussed. We argue that phase separation in\nM0.8+xFe1.6+ySe2 has pure magnetic origin. It occurs below Neel temperature\nwhen iron magnetic moment achieves some critical magnitude. We state that there\nis a spacer between the majority 245 and minority 122 phases. Using ab-initio\nspin polarized band structure calculations we demonstrate that compressed\nvacancy ordered Rb2Fe4Se5 phase can be conductive and therefore may serve as a\nprotective interface spacer between the pure metallic Rb{\\delta}Fe2Se2 phase\nand the insulating Rb2Fe4Se5 phase providing the percolative Josephson-junction\nlike superconductivity in the whole sample of Rb0.8+xFe1.6+ySe2 Our lattice\ndynamics calculations show significant difference in the phonon spectra of the\nconductive and insulating Rb2Fe4.Se5 phases.\n", "  Deriving mathematical expressions of two zero modes for a $\\pi$-band\ntight-binding model, we identify a class of bipartite graphs having the same\nnumber of subgraph sites, where each graph represents one of the\nquasi-hexagonal nanographene molecule with a center vacancy (VANG). Indeed, in\na VANG molecule, C$_{60}$H$_{24}$, showing stability in a density-functional\nsimulation at the highest occupied level, there appear two pseudo-degenerate\nzero modes, a vacancy-centered quasi-localized zero mode, and extending zero\nmode with a $\\sqrt{3} \\times \\sqrt{3}$ structure. Since there is a finite\nenergy gap between these two zero-energy modes and the other modes, low-lying\nstates composed of quasi-degenerate zero modes appear as magnetic multiplets.\nThus, the unique magnetic characteristics derived in our theory are expected to\nhold for synthesized VANG molecules in reality.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations with embedded atom model potential, we\nstudy structural evolution of ${\\rm Cu_{64.5}Zr_{35.5}}$ alloy during the\ncooling in a wide range of cooling rates $\\gamma\\in(1.5\\cdot 10^{9},10^{13})$\nK/s. Investigating short- and medium-range order, we show that structure of\n${\\rm Cu_{64.5}Zr_{35.5}}$ metallic glass essentially depends on cooling rate.\nIn particular, a decrease of the cooling rate leads to a increase of abundances\nof both the icosahedral-like clusters and Frank-Kasper Z16 polyhedra. The\namounts of these clusters in the glassy state drastically increase at the\n$\\gamma_{\\rm min}=1.5\\cdot 10^{9}$ K/s. Analysing the structure of the glass at\n$\\gamma_{\\rm min}$, we observe the formation of nano-sized crystalline grain of\n${\\rm Cu_2Zr}$ intermetallic compound with the structure of ${\\rm Cu_2Mg}$\nLaves phase. The structure of this compound is isomorphous with that for ${\\rm\nCu_5Zr}$ intermetallic compound. Both crystal lattices consist of two type of\nclusters: Cu-centered 13-atom icosahedral-like cluster and Zr-centered 17-atom\nFrank-Kasper polyhedron Z16. That suggests the same structural motifs for the\nmetallic glass and intermetallic compounds and explains the drastic increase of\nthe abundances of these clusters observed at $\\gamma_{\\rm min}$.\n", "  Boolean logic is the foundation of modern digital information processing.\nRecently, there has been a growing interest in phenomena based on pure spin\ncurrents, which allow to move from charge to spin based logic gates. We study a\nproof-of-principle logic device based on the ferrimagnetic insulator Yttrium\nIron Garnet (YIG), with Pt strips acting as injectors and detectors for\nnonequilibrium magnons. We experimentally observe incoherent superposition of\nmagnons generated by different injectors. This allows to implement a fully\nfunctional majority gate, enabling multiple logic operations (AND and OR) in\none and the same device. Clocking frequencies of the order of several GHz and\nstraightforward down-scaling make our device promising for applications.\n", "  We use artificial neural networks to parameterize the shape functions in\ninclusive semileptonic $B$ decays without charm. Our approach avoids the\nadoption of functional form models and allows for a straightforward\nimplementation of all experimental and theoretical constraints on the shape\nfunctions. The results are used to extract $|V_{ub}|$ in the GGOU framework and\ncompared with the original GGOU paper and the latest HFAG results, finding good\nagreement in both cases. The possible impact of future Belle-II data on the\n$M_X$ distribution is also discussed.\n", "  We explore predictions of the wounded quark model for particle production and\nproperties of the initial state formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. The approach is applied uniformly to A+A collisions in a wide\ncollision energy range, as well as for p+A and p+p collisions at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). We find that generically the predictions from wounded\nquarks for such features as eccentricities or initial sizes are close (within\n15\\%) to predictions of the wounded nucleon model with an amended binary\ncomponent. A larger difference is found for the size in p+Pb system, where the\nwounded quark model yields a smaller (more compact) initial fireball than the\nstandard wounded nucleon model. The inclusion of subnucleonic degrees of\nfreedom allows us to analyze p+p collisions in an analogous way, with\npredictions that can be used in further collective evolution. The approximate\nlinear dependence of particle production in A+A collisions on the number of\nwounded quarks, as found in previous studies, makes the approach based on\nwounded quarks natural. Importantly, at the LHC energies we find approximate\nuniformity in particle production from wounded quarks, where at a given\ncollision energy per nucleon pair similar production of initial entropy per\nsource is needed to explain the particle production from p+p collisions up to\nA+A collisions. We also discuss the sensitivity of the wounded quark model\npredictions to distribution of quarks in nucleons, distribution of nucleons in\nnuclei, and to the quark-quark inelasticity profile in the impact parameter. In\nour procedure, the quark-quark inelasticity profile is chosen in such a way\nthat the experiment-based parametrization of the proton-proton inelasticity\nprofile is properly reproduced. The parameters of the overlaid multiplicity\ndistribution is fixed from p+p and p+Pb data.\n", "  Recent studies of chondrites have found a tungsten isotopic anomaly between\nchondrules and matrix. Given the refractory nature of tungsten, this implies\nthat W was carried into the solar nebula by at least two distinct families of\npre-solar grains. The observed chondrule/matrix split requires that the\ndistinct families were kept separate during the dust coagulation process, and\nthat the two families of grain interacted with the chondrule formation\nmechanism differently. We take the co-existence of different families of solids\nin the same general orbital region at the chondrule-precursor size as given,\nand explore the requirements for them to have interacted with the chondrule\nformation process at significantly different rates. We show that this sorting\nof families of solids into chondrule and matrix destined dust had to have been\nat least as powerful a sorting mechanism as the relative settling of\naerodynamically distinct grains at at least two scale heights above the\nmidplane. The requirement that the chondrule formation mechanism was correlated\nin some fashion with a dust grain sorting mechanism argues strongly for\nspatially localized chondrule formation mechanisms such as turbulent\ndissipation in non-thermally ionized disk surface layers, and argues against\nvolume filling mechanisms such as planetesimal bow shocks.\n", "  Weakly-coupled models for the 750 GeV diphoton resonance often invoke new\nparticles carrying both color and/or electric charges to mediate loop-induced\ncouplings of the resonance to two gluons and two photons. The new colored\nparticles may not be stable and could decay into final states containing\nstandard model particles. We consider an electroweak doublet of vector-like\nquarks (VLQs) carrying electric charges of 5/3 and 2/3, respectively, which\nmediate the loop-induced couplings of the 750 GeV resonance. If the VLQ has a\nmass at around 1 TeV, it naturally gives rise to the observed diphoton signal\nstrength while all couplings remain perturbative up to a high scale. At the\nsame time, if the charge-5/3 VLQ decays into final states containing top quark\nand W boson, it would contribute to the multilepton excesses observed in both\nRun 1 and Run 2 data. It is also possible to incorporate a dark matter\ncandidate in the decay final states to explain the observed relic density.\n", "  Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) show evidence of a global correlation of\ndebated origin between X-ray and optical luminosity. We study for the first\ntime this correlation in two transient LMXBs, the black hole V404 Cyg and the\nneutron star Cen X-4, over 6 orders of magnitude in X-ray luminosity, from\noutburst to quiescence. After subtracting the contribution from the companion\nstar, the Cen X-4 data can be described by a single power law correlation of\nthe form $L_{opt}\\propto\\,L_{X}^{0.44}$, consistent with disk reprocessing. We\nfind a similar correlation slope for V404 Cyg in quiescence (0.46) and a\nsteeper one (0.56) in the outburst hard state of 1989. However, V404 Cyg is\nabout $160-280$ times optically brighter, at a given $3-9$ keV X-ray\nluminosity, compared to Cen X-4. This ratio is a factor of 10 smaller in\nquiescence, where the normalization of the V404 Cyg correlation also changes.\nWe show that once the bolometric X-ray emission is considered and the known\nmain differences between V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 are taken into account (a larger\ncompact object mass, accretion disk size, and the presence of a strong jet\ncontribution in the hard state for the black hole system) the two systems lie\non the same correlation. In V404 Cyg, the jet dominates spectrally at\noptical-infrared frequencies during the hard state, but makes a negligible\ncontribution in quiescence, which may account for the change in its correlation\nslope and normalization. These results provide a benchmark to compare with data\nfrom the 2015 outburst of V404 Cyg and, potentially, other transient LMXBs as\nwell.\n", "  The specific heat of liquid helium confined under pressure in nanoporous\nmaterial and the formation, in these conditions, of a glass phase accompanied\nby latent heat are known. These properties are in good agreement with a recent\nmodel predicting, in liquid elements, the formation of ultrastable glass having\nuniversal thermodynamic properties. The third law of thermodynamics involves\nthat the specific heat decreases at low temperatures and consequently the\neffective transition temperature of the glass increases up to the temperature\nwhere the frozen enthalpy becomes equal to the predicted value. The glass\nresidual entropy is about 23.6% of the melting entropy.\n", "  A BGO electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is built for the DArk Matter\nParticle Explorer (DAMPE) mission. The effect of temperature on the BGO ECAL\nwas investigated with a thermal vacuum experiment. The light output of a BGO\ncrystal depends on temperature significantly. The temperature coefficient of\neach BGO crystal bar has been calibrated, and a correction method is also\npresented in this paper.\n", "  A two-component two-dimensional (2D) dipolar bosonic system in the bilayer\ngeometry is considered. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a wide\nrange of layer spacings we analyze in detail the pair correlation functions,\nthe static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing\nthe layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer\nstates. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,\nsuppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation\nspectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\\em\nin-phase} (symmetric) and {\\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,\nduring the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic\nreconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode\nspectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer\nsuperfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\\gamma_s=\\rho_s/\\rho$). In\na pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is\nrecovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously,\nand the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a\nsuperfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly\nwith $\\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\\gamma_s$ is\nreduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the\ninterlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by\nstatic and dynamic properties.\n", "  In previous work, we presented a statistical scan over the soft supersymmetry\nbreaking parameters of the minimal SUSY $B-L$ model. For specificity of\ncalculation, unification of the gauge parameters was enforced by allowing the\ntwo ${\\mathbb Z}_{3}\\times {\\mathbb Z}_{3}$ Wilson lines to have mass scales\nseparated by approximately an order of magnitude. This introduced an additional\n\"left-right\" sector below the unification scale. In this paper, for three\nimportant reasons, we modify our previous analysis by demanding that the mass\nscales of the two Wilson lines be simultaneous and equal to an \"average\nunification\" mass $\\left<M_{U}\\right>$. The present analysis is 1) more\n\"natural\" than the previous calculations, which were only valid in a very\nspecific region of the Calabi-Yau moduli space, 2) the theory is conceptually\nsimpler in that the left-right sector has been removed and 3) in the present\nanalysis the lack of gauge unification is due to threshold\neffects--particularly heavy string thresholds, which we calculate statistically\nin detail. As in our previous work, the theory is renormalization group evolved\nfrom $\\left<M_{U}\\right>$ to the electroweak scale--being subjected,\nsequentially, to the requirement of radiative $B-L$ and electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the present experimental lower bounds on the $B-L$ vector boson and\nsparticle masses, as well as the lightest neutral Higgs mass of $\\sim$125 GeV.\nThe subspace of soft supersymmetry breaking masses that satisfies all such\nconstraints is presented and shown to be substantial.\n", "  Continuing the work arXiv:1603.06207, we study perturbative series in general\n3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons matter theory with $U(1)_R$\nsymmetry, which is given by a power series expansion of inverse Chern-Simons\nlevels. We find that the perturbative series are usually non-Borel summable\nalong positive real axis for various observables. Alternatively we prove that\nthe perturbative series are always Borel summable along negative (positive)\nimaginary axis for positive (negative) Chern-Simons levels. It turns out that\nthe Borel resummations along this direction are the same as exact results and\ntherefore correct ways of resumming the perturbative series.\n", "  We propose a method to break the chiral symmetry of light in traveling wave\nresonators by coupling the optical modes to a lossy channel. Through the\nengineered dissipation, an indirect dissipative coupling between two oppositely\npropagating modes can be realized. Combining with reactive coupling, it can\nbreak the chiral symmetry of the resonator, allowing light propagating only in\none direction. The chiral symmetry breaking is numerically verified by the\nsimulation of an electromagnetic field in a micro-ring cavity, with proper\nrefractive index distributions. This work provokes us to emphasize the\ndissipation engineering in photonics, and the generalized idea can also be\napplied to other systems.\n", "  We present an approach to construct position-sensitive silicon detectors with\nan integrated cooling circuit. Tests on samples demonstrate that a very modest\nliquid flow very effectively cool the devices up to a power dissipation of over\n10~W/cm$^2$. The liquid flow is found to have a negligible impact on the\nmechanical performance. A finite-element simulation predicts the cooling\nperformance to an accuracy of approximately 10~\\%.\n", "  We study spin-orbit torques and charge pumping in magnetic quasi-one\ndimensional zigzag nanoribbons with hexagonal lattice, in the presence of large\nintrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Such a system experiences topological phase\ntransition from a trivial band insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator\neither by tuning the magnetization direction or the intrinsic spin-orbit\ncoupling. We find that spin-charge conversion efficiency (i.e. spin-orbit\ntorque and charge pumping) is dramatically enhanced at the topological\ntransition, displaying a substantial angular anisotropy.\n", "  A search for narrow resonances decaying into dijet final states is performed\non data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 inverse femtobarns. The data\nwere collected with the CMS detector using a novel technique called data\nscouting, in which the information associated with these selected events is\nmuch reduced, permitting collection of larger data samples. This technique\nenables CMS to record events containing jets at a rate of 1 kHz, by collecting\nthe data from the high-level-trigger system. In this way, the sensitivity to\nlow-mass resonances is increased significantly, allowing previously\ninaccessible couplings of new resonances to quarks and gluons to be probed. The\nresulting dijet mass distribution yields no evidence of narrow resonances.\nUpper limits are presented on the resonance cross sections as a function of\nmass, and compared with a variety of models predicting narrow resonances. The\nlimits are translated into upper limits on the coupling of a leptophobic\nresonance Z'[B] to quarks, improving on the results obtained by previous\nexperiments for the mass range from 500 to 800 GeV.\n", "  We construct a supersymmetric black ring solution of SU(2) N=1, d=5\nSuper-Einstein-Yang-Mills (SEYM) theory by adding a distorted BPST instanton to\nan Abelian black ring solution of the same theory. The change cannot be\nobserved from spatial infinity: neither the mass, nor the angular momenta or\nthe values of the scalars at infinity differ from those of the Abelian ring.\nThe entropy is, however, sensitive to the presence of the non-Abelian\ninstanton, and it is smaller than that of the Abelian ring, in analogy to what\nhappens in the supersymmetric coloured black holes recently constructed in the\nsame theory and in N=2, d=4 SEYM. By taking the limit in which the two angular\nmomenta become equal we derive a non-Abelian generalization of the BMPV\nrotating black-hole solution.\n", "  We study the multi-instanton partition functions of the $\\Omega$-deformed\n$\\mathcal N =2^{*}$ $SU(2) $ gauge theory in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS)\nlimit. They depend on the deformation parameters $\\epsilon_{1}$, the scalar\nfield expectation value $a$, and the hypermultiplet mass $m$. At fixed\ninstanton number $k$, they are rational functions of $\\epsilon_{1}, a, m$ and\nwe look for possible regularities that admit a parametrical description in the\nnumber of instantons. In each instanton sector, the contribution to the\ndeformed Nekrasov prepotential has poles for \"large\" deformation parameters. To\nclarify the properties of these singularities we exploit Bethe/gauge\ncorrespondence and examine the special ratios $m/\\epsilon_{1}$ at which the\nassociated spectral problem is $n$-gap. At these special points we illustrate\nseveral structural simplifications occurring in the partition functions. After\ndiscussing various tools to compute the prepotential, we analyze the\nnon-perturbative corrections up to $k=24$ instantons and present various closed\nexpressions for the coefficients of the singular terms. Both the regular and\nsingular parts of the prepotential are resummed over all instantons and\ncompared successfully with the exact prediction from the spectral theory of the\nLam\\'e equation, showing that the pole singularities are an artifact of the\ninstanton expansion. The analysis is fully worked out in the 1-gap case, but\nthe final pole cancellation is proved for a generic ratio $m/\\epsilon_{1}$\nrelating it to the gap width of the Lam\\'e equation.\n", "  We use the recent observations of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and\npolarization anisotropies provided by the Planck satellite experiment to place\nconstraints on the running $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s} = \\mathrm{d}n_{\\mathrm{s}} /\n\\mathrm{d}\\log k$ and the running of the running $\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}} =\n\\mathrm{d}\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}} / \\mathrm{d}\\log k$ of the spectral index\n$n_{\\mathrm{s}}$ of primordial scalar fluctuations. We find\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}=0.011\\pm0.010$ and $\\beta_\\mathrm{s}=0.027\\pm0.013$ at\n$68\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$, suggesting the presence of a running of the running at the\nlevel of two standard deviations. We find no significant correlation between\n$\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and foregrounds parameters, with the exception of the\npoint sources amplitude at $143\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $A^{PS}_{143}$, which shifts by\nhalf sigma when the running of the running is considered. We further study the\ncosmological implications of such preference for\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{s},\\beta_\\mathrm{s}\\sim0.01$ by including in the analysis the\nlensing amplitude $A_L$, the curvature parameter $\\Omega_k$, and the sum of\nneutrino masses $\\sum m_{\\nu}$. We find that when the running of the running is\nconsidered, Planck data are more compatible with the standard expectations of\n$A_L = 1$ and $\\Omega_k = 0$ but still hint at possible deviations. The\nindication for $\\beta_\\mathrm{s} > 0$ survives at two standard deviations when\nexternal datasets such as BAO and CFHTLenS are included in the analysis, and\npersists at $\\sim 1.7$ standard deviations when CMB lensing is considered. We\ndiscuss the possibility of constraining $\\beta_\\mathrm{s}$ with current and\nfuture measurements of CMB spectral distortions, showing that an experiment\nlike PIXIE could provide strong constraints on $\\alpha_\\mathrm{s}$ and\n$\\beta_\\mathrm{s}$.\n", "  A modified version of the Ginzburg-Landau equation is introduced which\naccounts for asymmetric couplings between neighbors sites on a one-dimensional\nlattice, with periodic boundary conditions. The drift term which reflects the\nimposed microscopic asymmetry seeds a generalized class of instabilities,\nreminiscent of the Benjamin-Feir type. The uniformly synchronized solution is\nspontaneously destabilized outside the region of parameters classically\nassociated to the Benjamin-Feir instability, upon injection of a non\nhomogeneous perturbation. The ensuing patterns can be of the traveling wave\ntype or display a patchy, colorful mosaic for the modulus of the complex\noscillators amplitude.\n", "  The SDHCAL technological prototype is a $1 \\times 1 \\times 1.3$~m$^3$\nhigh-granularity Semi-Digital Hadronic CALorimeter using Glass Resistive Plate\nChambers as sensitive medium. It is one of the two HCAL options considered by\nthe ILD Collaboration to be proposed for the detector of the future\nInternational Linear Collider project. The prototype is made of up to 50 GRPC\ndetectors of 1~m$^2$ size and 3~mm thickness each with an embedded semi-digital\nelectronics readout that is autotriggering and power-pulsed. The GRPC readout\nis finely segmented into pads of 1~cm$^2$. This proceeding describes the\nprototype, its operation and its performance in energy reconstruction. Aspects\nof the GRPC readout modelling and comparisons with simulations are also\npresented.\n", "  In this note, we demonstrated for the first time that one can derive an\nexpression for the effective diffusion coefficient, equal to the Lifson-Jackson\nformula, using a subsequent homogenization of the 1D\nreaction-diffusion-advection equation. The latter has been derived by applying\nasymptotic perturbation analysis to the underlying 3D reaction-diffusion\nequation with spatially dependent no-flux boundary conditions and incorporates\nthe effects of boundary interactions on the reactants via a boundary-induced\nadvection term [S. Martens et al, Phys. Rev. E 91, 022902 (2015)].\n", "  We discuss the efficacy of evolutionary method for the purpose of structural\nanalysis of amorphous solids. At present ab initio molecular dynamics (MD)\nbased melt-quench technique is used and this deterministic approach has proven\nto be successful to study amorphous materials. We show that a stochastic\napproach motivated by Darwinian evolution can also be used to simulate\namorphous structures. Applying this method, in conjunction with density\nfunctional theory (DFT) based electronic, ionic and cell relaxation, we\nre-investigate two well known amorphous semiconductors, namely silicon and\nindium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO). We find that characteristic structural\nparameters like average bond length and bond angle are within $\\sim$ 2% to\nthose reported by ab initio MD calculations and experimental studies.\n", "  When an impurity is immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, impurity-boson\ninteractions are expected to dress the impurity into a quasiparticle, the Bose\npolaron. We superimpose an ultracold atomic gas of $^{87}$Rb with a much lower\ndensity gas of fermionic $^{40}$K impurities. Through the use of a Feshbach\nresonance and RF spectroscopy, we characterize the energy, spectral width and\nlifetime of the resultant polaron on both the attractive and the repulsive\nbranches in the strongly interacting regime. The width of the polaron in the\nattractive branch is narrow compared to its binding energy, even as the\ntwo-body scattering length formally diverges.\n", "  Dense, active systems show active turbulence, a state characterised by flow\nfields that are chaotic, with continually changing velocity jets and swirls.\nHere we review our current understanding of active turbulence. The development\nis primarily based on the theory and simulations of active liquid crystals, but\nwith accompanying summaries of related literature.\n", "  Low-dimensional beryllium systems constitute interesting case studies for the\ntest of correlation methods because of the importance of both static and\ndynamical correlation in the formation of the bond. Aiming to describe the\nwhole dissociation curve of extended Be systems we chose to apply the method of\nincrements (MoI) in its multireference (MR) formalism. However, in order to do\nso an insight into the wave function was necessary. Therefore we started by\nfocusing on the description of small Be chains via standard quantum chemical\nmethods and gave a brief analysis of the main characteristics of their wave\nfunctions. We then applied the MoI to larger beryllium systems, starting from\nthe Be6 ring. First, the complete active space formalism (CAS-MoI) was employed\nand the results were used as reference for local MR calculations of the whole\ndissociation curve. Despite this approach is well established for the\ncalculation of systems with limited multireference character, its application\nto the description of whole dissociation curves still requires further testing.\nAfter discussing the role of the basis set, the method was finally applied to\nlarger rings and extrapolated to an infinite chain.\n", "  Operation and performance of the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) mostly\ndepend on the quality and characteristics of the electrode materials. The\nIndia-based Neutrino Observatory collaboration has chosen glass RPCs as the\nactive detector elements for its Iron Calorimeter detector and is going to\ndeploy RPCs in an unprecedented scale. Therefore, it is imperative that we\nstudy the electrode material aspects in detail. We report here, systematic\ncharacterization studies on the glasses from two manufacturers. RPC detectors\nwere built using these glasses and performances of the same were compared with\ntheir material properties.\n", "  We investigate propagating dark soliton solutions of the two-dimensional\ndefocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger / Gross-Pitaevskii (NLS/GP) equation that\nare transversely confined to propagate in an infinitely long channel. Families\nof single, vortex, and multi-lobed solitons are computed using a\nspectrally-accurate numerical scheme. The multi-lobed solitons are unstable to\nsmall transverse perturbations. However, the single-lobed solitons are stable\nif they are sufficiently confined along the transverse direction, which\nexplains their effective one-dimensional dynamics. The emergence of a\ntransverse modulational instability is characterized in terms of a spectral\nbifurcation. The critical confinement width for this bifurcation is found to\ncoincide with the existence of a propagating vortex solution and the onset of a\n\"snaking\" instability in the dark soliton dynamics that, in turn, give rise to\nvortex or multi-vortex excitations. These results shed light on the\nsuperfluidic hydrodynamics of dispersive shock waves in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates and nonlinear optics.\n", "  We construct zero-curvature representations for the equations of motion of a\nclass of sigma-models with complex homogeneous target spaces, not necessarily\nsymmetric. We show that in the symmetric case the proposed flat connection is\ngauge-equivalent to the conventional one.\n", "  A method is proposed to identify target states that optimize a metastability\nindex amongst a set of trial states and use these target states as milestones\n(or core sets) to build Markov State Models (MSMs). If the optimized\nmetastability index is small, this automatically guarantees the accuracy of the\nMSM, in the sense that the transitions between the target milestones is indeed\napproximately Markovian. The method is simple to implement and use, it does not\nrequire that the dynamics on the trial milestones be Markovian, and it also\noffers the possibility to partition the system's state-space by assigning every\ntrial milestone to the target milestones it is most likely to visit next and to\nidentify transition state regions. Here the method is tested on the Gly-Ala-Gly\npeptide, where it shown to correctly identify the expected metastable states in\nthe dihedral angle space of the molecule without \\textit{a~priori} information\nabout these states. It is also applied to analyze the folding landscape of the\nBeta3s mini-protein, where it is shown to identify the folded basin as a\nconnecting hub between an helix-rich region, which is entropically stabilized,\nand a beta-rich region, which is energetically stabilized and acts as a kinetic\ntrap.\n", "  We construct discrete symmetry transformations for deformed relativistic\nkinematics based on group valued momenta. We focus on the specific example of\nkappa-deformations of the Poincare algebra with associated momenta living on (a\nsub-manifold of) de Sitter space. Our approach relies on the description of\nquantum states constructed from deformed kinematics and the observable charges\nassociated with them. The results we present provide the first step towards the\nanalysis of experimental bounds on the deformation parameter kappa to be\nderived via precision measurements of discrete symmetries and CPT.\n", "  The gravitational memory effect leads to a net displacement in the relative\npositions of test particles. This memory is related to the change in the strain\nof the gravitational radiation field between infinite past and infinite future\nretarded times. There are three known sources of the memory effect: (i) the\nloss of energy to future null infinity by massless fields or particles, (ii)\nthe ejection of massive particles to infinity from a bound system and (iii)\nhomogeneous, source-free gravitational waves. In the context of linearized\ntheory, we show that asymptotic conditions controlling these known sources of\nthe gravitational memory effect rule out any other possible sources with\nphysically reasonable stress-energy tensors. Except for the source-free\ngravitational waves, the two other known sources produce gravitational memory\nwith E-mode radiation strain, characterized by a certain curl-free sky pattern\nof their polarization. Thus our results show that the only known source of\nB-mode gravitational memory is of primordial origin, corresponding in the\nlinearized theory to a homogeneous wave entering from past null infinity.\n", "  We consider the loop quantization of the (diagonal) Bianchi type IX\ncosmological model. We explore different quantization prescriptions that extend\nthe work of Wilson-Ewing and Singh. In particular, we study two different ways\nof implementing the so-called inverse triad corrections. We construct the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian constraint operators and show that the singularity is\nformally resolved. We find the effective equations associated with the\ndifferent quantization prescriptions, and study the relation with the isotropic\n$k$=1 model that, classically, is contained within the Bianchi IX model. We use\ngeometrically defined scalar observables to explore the physical implications\nof each of these theories. This is the first part in a series of papers\nanalyzing different aspects of the Bianchi IX model, with inverse corrections,\nwithin loop quantum cosmology.\n", "  We present the discovery of three protoclusters at $z\\sim3\\mathrm{-}4$ with\nspectroscopic confirmation in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Legacy\nSurvey Deep Fields. In these fields, we investigate the large-scale projected\nsky distribution of $z\\sim3\\mathrm{-}6$ Lyman break galaxies and identify 21\nprotocluster candidates from regions that are overdense at more than $4\\sigma$\noverdensity significance. Based on cosmological simulations, it is expected\nthat more than $76\\%$ of these candidates will evolve into a galaxy cluster of\nat least a halo mass of $10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ at $z=0$. We perform\nfollow-up spectroscopy for eight of the candidates using Subaru/FOCAS,\nKeckII/DEIMOS, and Gemini-N/GMOS. In total we target 462 dropout candidates and\nobtain 138 spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm three real protoclusters at\n$z=3\\mathrm{-}4$ with more than five members spectroscopically identified, and\nfind one to be an incidental overdense region by mere chance alignment. The\nother four candidate regions at $z\\sim5\\mathrm{-}6$ require more spectroscopic\nfollow-up in order to be conclusive. A $z=3.67$ protocluster, which has eleven\nspectroscopically confirmed members, shows a remarkable core-like structure\ncomposed of a central small region ($<0.5\\,\\mathrm{physical\\>Mpc}$) and an\noutskirts region ($\\sim1.0\\,\\mathrm{physical\\>Mpc}$). The Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidths of members of the protocluster are significantly smaller than those of\nfield galaxies at the same redshift while there is no difference in the UV\nluminosity distributions. These results imply that some environmental effects\nstart operating as early as at $z\\sim4$ along with the growth of the\nprotocluster structure.\n", "  Ground state phases of a generalized XY model with magnetic and generalized\nnematic couplings on a non-bipartite triangular lattice are investigated in the\nexchange interactions parameter space. We demonstrate that the model displays a\nnumber of ordered and quasi-ordered phases as a result of geometrical\nfrustration and/or competition between the magnetic and generalized nematic\ninteractions. The nature and the extent of the respective phases depend on the\nparameter $q$, characterizing the higher-order harmonics term in the\nHamiltonian. Motivated by the recent discovery of the experimental realization\nof the model with $q=2$ in the seemingly unrelated field of the systems\nchemistry [A.B. Cairns et al., Nature Chemistry 8, 442 (2016)], the model for\n$q>2$ is discussed in the context of the prediction of structural phases of a\nclass of bimetalic cyanides based on a mapping between the two systems.\n", "  The upgrade of the current BESIII Endcap TOF (ETOF) is carried out with the\nMulti-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC) technology. The installation of the\nnew ETOF has been finished in October 2015. The first results of the MRPCs\ncommissioning at BESIII are reported in this paper.\n", "  Transitional disks, protoplanetary disks with deep and wide central gaps, may\nbe the result of planetary sculpting. By comparing numerical planet-opening-gap\nmodels with observed gaps, we find systems of 3-6 giant planets are needed in\norder to open gaps with the observed depths and widths. We explore the\ndynamical stability of such multi-planet systems using N-body simulations that\nincorporate prescriptions for gas effects. We find they can be stable over a\ntypical disk lifetime, with the help of eccentricity damping from the residual\ngap gas that facilitates planets locking into mean motion resonances. However,\nin order to account for the occurrence rate of transitional disks, the planet\nsculpting scenario demands gap-opening-friendly disk conditions, in particular,\na disk viscosity $\\alpha\\lesssim0.001$. In addition, the demography of giant\nplanets at $\\sim 3-30$ AU separations, poorly constrained by current data, has\nto largely follow occurrence rates extrapolated outward from radial velocity\nsurveys, not the lower occurrence rates extrapolated inward from direct imaging\nsurveys. Even with the most optimistic occurrence rates, transitional disks\ncannot be a common phase that most gas disks experience at the end of their\nlife, as popularly assumed, simply because there are not enough planets to open\nthese gaps. Finally, as consequences of demanding almost all giant planets at\nlarge separations participate in transitional disk sculpting, the majority of\nsuch planets must form early and end up in a chain of mean motion resonances at\nthe end of disk lifetime.\n", "  We present results of a complete integral field survey of the bright SNR N49\nin the LMC, obtained with the WiFeS instrument mounted on the ANU 2.3m\ntelescope at Siding Spring Observatory. From theoretical shock modelling with\nthe new MAPPINGS 5.1 code we have, for the first time, subjected the optical Fe\nemission line spectrum of a supernova remnant to a detailed abundance and\ndynamical analysis covering 8 separate stages of ionisation. This allows us to\nderive the dust depletion factors as a function of ionisation stage. We have\nshown that there is substantial (30% - 90%) destruction of Fe-bearing dust\ngrains in these fast shocks ($v_s \\sim 250$ km/s), and we have confirmed that\nthe dominant dust destruction is through the non-thermal sputtering and\ngrain-grain collision mechanisms developed in a number of theoretical works.\n", "  We use first-principles calculations to investigate the interplay between\nstrain and the charge state of point defect impurities in complex oxides. Our\nwork is motivated by recent interest in using defects as active elements to\nprovide novel functionality in coherent epitaxial films. Using oxygen vacancies\nas model point defects, and CaMnO$_3$ and MnO as model materials, we calculate\nthe changes in internal strain caused by changing the charge state of the\nvacancies, and conversely the effect of strain on charge-state stability. Our\nresults show that the charge state is a degree of freedom that can be used to\ncontrol the interaction of defects with strain and hence the concentration and\nlocation of defects in epitaxial films. We propose the use of field-effect\ngating to reversibly change the charge state of defects and hence the internal\nstrain and corresponding strain-induced functionalities.\n", "  We present a local setup for the recently introduced BRST-invariant\nformulation of Yang-Mills theories for linear covariant gauges that takes into\naccount the existence of gauge copies \\`a la Gribov and Zwanziger. Through the\nconvenient use of auxiliary fields, including one of the Stueckelberg type, it\nis shown that both the action and the associated nilpotent BRST operator can be\nput in local form. Direct consequences of this fully local and BRST-symmetric\nframework are drawn from its Ward identities: (i) an exact prediction for the\nlongitudinal part of the gluon propagator in linear covariant gauges that is\ncompatible with recent lattice results and (ii) a proof of the gauge-parameter\nindependence of all correlation functions of local BRST-invariant operators.\n", "  The dynamics of superfluid 4He at and above the Landau quasiparticle regime\nis investigated by high precision inelastic neutron scattering measurements of\nthe dynamic structure factor. A highly structured response is observed above\nthe familiar phonon-maxon-roton spectrum, characterized by sharp thresholds for\nphonon-phonon, maxon-roton and roton-roton coupling processes. The experimental\ndynamic structure factor is compared to the calculation of the same physical\nquantity by a Dynamic Many-body theory including three-phonon processes\nself-consistently. The theory is found to provide a quantitative description of\nthe dynamics of the correlated bosons for energies up to about three times that\nof the Landau quasiparticles.\n", "  The evolution of dwarf satellites of the Milky Way is affected by the\ncombination of ram pressure and tidal stripping, and internal feedback from\nmassive stars. We investigate gas loss processes in the smallest satellites of\nthe Milky Way using three-dimensional, high resolution, idealized wind tunnel\nsimulations, accounting for gas loss through both ram pressure stripping and\nexpulsion by supernova feedback. Using initial conditions appropriate for a\ndwarf galaxy like Leo T, we investigate whether or not environmental gas\nstripping and internal feedback can quench these low mass galaxies on the\nexpected timescales, shorter than 2 Gyr. We find that supernova feedback\ncontributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate\ngalaxies. However, we also find that ram pressure stripping is less efficient\nthan expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that,\nalthough ram pressure stripping can eventually completely strip these galaxies,\nother physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with\nthe rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low mass Milky Way\ndwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this\nscenario, including host-satellite tidal interactions, cored vs. cuspy dark\nmatter profiles, reionization, and satellite pre-processing. We conclude that a\nproper accounting of these physics together is necessary to understand the\nquenching of low mass Milky Way satellites.\n", "  Using the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), we have resolved the circumstellar\ndebris disk around HD 111520 at a projected range of ~30-100 AU in both total\nand polarized $H$-band intensity. The disk is seen edge-on at a position angle\nof ~165$^{\\circ}$ along the spine of emission. A slight inclination or\nasymmetric warping are covariant and alters the interpretation of the observed\ndisk emission. We employ 3 point spread function (PSF) subtraction methods to\nreduce the stellar glare and instrumental artifacts to confirm that there is a\nroughly 2:1 brightness asymmetry between the NW and SE extension. This specific\nfeature makes HD 111520 the most extreme examples of asymmetric debris disks\nobserved in scattered light among similar highly inclined systems, such as HD\n15115 and HD 106906. We further identify a tentative localized brightness\nenhancement and scale height enhancement associated with the disk at ~40 AU\naway from the star on the SE extension. We also find that the fractional\npolarization rises from 10 to 40% from 0.5\" to 0.8\" from the star. The\ncombination of large brightness asymmetry and symmetric polarization fraction\nleads us to believe that an azimuthal dust density variation is causing the\nobserved asymmetry.\n", "  In this second paper on the entire virial region of the relaxed fossil\ncluster RXJ1159+5531, we present a hydrostatic analysis of the hot intracluster\nmedium (ICM). For a model consisting of ICM, stellar mass from the central\ngalaxy (BCG), and an NFW dark matter (DM) halo, we obtain good descriptions of\nthe projected radial profiles of ICM emissivity and temperature. The BCG\nstellar mass is clearly detected with M_star/L_K = 0.61 +/- 0.11 solar,\nconsistent with stellar population synthesis models for a Milky-Way IMF. We\nobtain a halo concentration, c_200 =8.4 +/- 1.0, and virial mass, M_200 = 7.9\n+/- 0.6 x 10^13 M_sun. For its mass, the inferred concentration is larger than\nmost relaxed halos produced in cosmological simulations with Planck parameters,\nconsistent with RXJ1159+5531 forming earlier than the general halo population.\nThe baryon fraction at r_200, f_b,200 = 0.134 +/- 0.007, is slightly below the\nPlanck value (0.155) for the universe. When we account for the stellar baryons\nassociated with non-central galaxies and the uncertain intracluster light,\nf_b,200 increases by ~0.015, consistent with the cosmic value. Performing our\nanalysis in the context of MOND still requires a large DM fraction (85.0% +/-\n2.5% at r=100 kpc) similar to that obtained using the standard Newtonian\napproach. The detection of a plausible stellar BCG mass component distinct from\nthe NFW DM halo in the total gravitational potential suggests that ~10^14 M_sun\nrepresents the mass scale above which dissipation is unimportant in the\nformation of the central regions of galaxy clusters. (Abridged)\n", "  We consider spin-dependent scatterers with large scattering cross-sections in\ngraphene -a Zeeman-like and an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling impurity- and show\nthat a gated ring around them can be engineered to produce an effcient control\nof the spin dependent transport, like current spin polarization and spin Hall\nangle. Our analysis is based on a spin-dependent partial-waves expansion of the\nelectronic wave-functions in the continuum approximation, described by the\nDirac equation.\n", "  The decay of a bound state weakly-coupled to a non-Hermitian tight-binding\nunstable continuum, i.e. a continuum of states comprising energies with\npositive imaginary part, is theoretically investigated. As compared to quantum\ndecay in an Hermitian continuum, in the non-Hermitian case a richer scenario\ncan be found as a result of non-unitary dynamics. Different behaviors are\nobserved depending on the kind of instability of the continuum. These include\ncomplete or fractional decay in convectively-unstable continua, the absence of\nquantum decay for a bound state with energy embedded in the continuum loop, and\nunstable (secular) growth with pseudo exponential amplification in the\nabsolutely-unstable regime. Analytical results are presented for a\nnearest-neighboring tight-binding continuum with asymmetric hopping rates\n$\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$, which shows a transition from convective to absolute\ninstability when the sign $\\kappa_1 \\kappa_2$ changes from positive to\nnegative. In the convectively unstable regime the model describes the decay of\na bound state coupled to a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field,\nwhich shows a pseudo-Hermitian dynamics. In the absolutely-unstable regime,\npseudo-Hermitian dynamics is broken and a pseudo exponential secular growth is\nobserved.\n", "  We study the spin-transfer drag mediated by the Brownian motion of skyrmions.\nThe essential idea is illustrated in a two-terminal geometry, in which a thin\nfilm of a magnetic insulator is placed in between two metallic reservoirs. An\nelectric current in one of the terminals pumps topological charge into the\nmagnet via a spin-transfer torque. The charge diffuses over the bulk of the\nsystem as stable skyrmion textures. By Onsager's reciprocity, the topological\ncharge leaving the magnet produces an electromotive force in the second\nterminal. The voltage signal decays algebraically with the separation between\ncontacts, in contrast to the exponential suppression of the spin drag driven by\nnon-protected excitations like magnons. We show how this topological effect can\nbe used as a tool to characterize the phase diagram of chiral magnets and thin\nfilms with interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions.\n", "  (abreviated) We aim to study the inner-wind structure (R<250 Rstar) of the\nwell-known red supergiant VY CMa. We analyse high spatial resolution\n(~0\".24x0\".13) ALMA Science Verification (SV) data in band 7 in which four\nthermal emission lines of gaseous sodium chloride (NaCl) are present at high\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For the first time, the NaCl emission in the inner wind\nregion of VY CMa is spatially resolved. The ALMA observations reveal the\ncontribution of up to four different spatial regions. The NaCl emission pattern\nis different compared to the dust continuum and TiO2 emission already analysed\nfrom the ALMA SV data. The emission can be reconciled with an axisymmetric\ngeometry, where the lower density polar/rotation axis has a position angle of\n~50 degrees measured from north to east. However, this picture can not capture\nthe full morphological diversity, and discrete mass ejection events need to be\ninvoked to explain localized higher-density regions. The velocity traced by the\ngaseous NaCl line profiles is significantly lower than the average wind\nterminal velocity, and much slower than some of the fastest mass ejections,\nsignalling a wide range of characteristic speeds for the mass loss. Gaseous\nNaCl is detected far beyond the main dust condensation region. Realising the\nrefractory nature of this metal halide, this hints at a chemical process\npreventing all NaCl from condensing onto dust grains. We show that in the case\nof the ratio of the surface binding temperature to the grain temperature being\n~50, only some 10% of NaCl remains in gaseous form, while for lower values of\nthis ratio thermal desorption efficiently evaporates NaCl. Photodesorption by\nstellar photons seems not to be a viable explanation for the detection of\ngaseous NaCl at 220 Rstar from the central star, and instead, we propose\nshock-induced sputtering driven by localized mass ejection events as\nalternative.\n", "  A model of low-temperature polar liquids is constructed that accounts for\nconfigurational heat capacity, entropy, and the effect of a strong electric\nfield on the glass transition. The model is based on Pad{\\'e}-truncated\nperturbation expansions of the liquid state theory. Depending on parameters, it\naccommodates an ideal glass transition of vanishing configurational entropy and\nits avoidance, with a square-root divergent enumeration function at the point\nof its termination. A composite density-temperature parameter $\\rho^\\gamma/T$,\noften used to represent combined pressure and temperature data, follows from\nthe model. The theory is in good agreement with experimental data for excess\n(over the crystal state) thermodynamics of molecular glass formers. We suggest\nthat the Kauzmann entropy crisis might be a signature of vanishing\nconfigurational entropy of a subset of degrees of freedom, multipolar rotations\nin our model. This scenario has observable consequences: (i) a dynamical\ncross-over of the relaxation time and (ii) the fragility index defined by the\nratio of the excess heat capacity and excess entropy at the glass transition.\nThe Kauzmann temperature of vanishing configurational entropy, and the\ncorresponding glass transition temperature, shift upward when the electric\nfield is applied. The temperature shift scales quadratically with the field\nstrength.\n", "  To unravel the origin of the dielectric anomaly at the antiferromagnetic\nordering of magnetoelectric Bi$_2$Fe$_4$O$_9$ we performed neutron powder\ndiffraction measurements across the N$\\acute{\\rm e}$el temperature, $T_{\\rm\nN}$. Both local structures and long-range symmetry are studied using the\ncomplementary analyses of atomic pair distribution function (PDF) and Rietveld\nmethods at temperatures 300~K, 250~K, and 200~K. We present that PDF peaks\nwhich reflect local atomic arrangements exhibit a noticeable variation below\n$T_{\\rm N}$ without long-range symmetry change. The implication of the PDF\nevolution is discussed in view of a local structural distortion at the onset of\nthe antiferromagnetic ordering.\n", "  We investigate the plasma and magnetic environment of active region NOAA\n11261 on 2 August 2011 around a GOES M1.4 flare/CME (SOL2011-08-02T06:19). We\ncompare coronal emission at (extreme) ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths, using\nSDO AIA and RHESSI images, in order to identify the relative timing and\nlocations of reconnection-related sources. We trace flare ribbon signatures at\nultraviolet wavelengths, in order to pin down the intersection of previously\nreconnected flaring loops at the lower solar atmosphere. These locations are\nused to calculate field lines from 3D nonlinear force-free magnetic field\nmodels, established on the basis of SDO HMI photospheric vector magnetic field\nmaps. With this procedure, we analyze the quasi-static time evolution of the\ncoronal model magnetic field previously involved in magnetic reconnection. This\nallows us, for the first time, to estimate the elevation speed of the current\nsheet's lower tip during an on-disk observed flare, as a few kilometers per\nsecond. Comparison to post-flare loops observed later above the limb in STEREO\nEUVI images supports this velocity estimate. Furthermore, we provide evidence\nfor an implosion of parts of the flaring coronal model magnetic field, and\nidentify the corresponding coronal sub-volumes associated to the loss of\nmagnetic energy. Finally, we spatially relate the build up of magnetic energy\nin the 3D models to highly sheared fields, established due to dynamic relative\nmotions of polarity patches within the active region.\n", "  We extend the phase field crystal (PFC) framework to quantitative modeling of\npolycrystalline graphene. PFC modeling is a powerful multiscale method for\nfinding the ground state configurations of large realistic samples that can be\nfurther used to study their mechanical, thermal or electronic properties. By\nfitting to quantum-mechanical density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we\nshow that the PFC approach is able to predict realistic formation energies and\ndefect structures of grain boundaries. We provide an in-depth comparison of the\nformation energies between PFC, DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.\nThe DFT and MD calculations are initialized using atomic configurations\nextracted from PFC ground states. Finally, we use the PFC approach to\nexplicitly construct large realistic polycrystalline samples and characterize\ntheir properties using MD relaxation to demonstrate their quality.\n", "  We develop a theory of artificial gauge fields in photon fluids for the cases\nof both second-order and third-order optical nonlinearities. This applies to\nweak excitations in the presence of pump fields carrying orbital angular\nmomentum, and is thus a type of Bogoliubov theory. The resulting artificial\ngauge fields experienced by the weak excitations are an interesting\ngeneralization of previous cases and reflect the PT-symmetry properties of the\nunderlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We illustrate the observable consequences\nof the resulting synthetic magnetic fields for examples involving both\nsecond-order and third-order nonlinearities.\n", "  We investigate polyatomic ultralong-range Rydberg molecules consisting of\nthree ground state atoms bound to a Rydberg atom via $s$- and $p$-wave\ninteractions. By employing the finite basis set representation of the\nunperturbed Rydberg electron Green's function we reduce the computational\neffort to solve the electronic problem substantially. This method is\nsubsequently applied to determine the potential energy surfaces of triatomic\nsystems in electronic $s$- and $p$-Rydberg states. Their molecular geometry and\nresulting vibrational structure are analyzed within an adiabatic approach that\nseparates the vibrational bending and stretching dynamics. This procedure\nyields information on the radial and angular arrangement of the nuclei and\nindicates in particular that kinetic couplings between bending and stretching\nmodes induce a linear structure in triatomic $l=0$ ultralong-range Rydberg\nmolecules.\n", "  We present a comparison of molecular clouds (MCs) from a simulation of\nsupernova-driven interstellar medium (ISM) turbulence with real MCs from the\nOuter Galaxy Survey. The radiative transfer calculations to compute synthetic\nCO spectra are carried out assuming the CO relative abundance depends only on\ngas density, according to four different models. Synthetic MCs are selected\nabove a threshold brightness temperature value, $T_{\\rm B,min}=1.4$ K, of the\n$J=1-0$ $^{12}$CO line, generating 16 synthetic catalogs (four different\nspatial resolutions and four CO abundance models), each containing up to\nseveral thousands MCs. The comparison with the observations focuses on the mass\nand size distributions and on the velocity-size and mass-size Larson relations.\nThe mass and size distributions are found to be consistent with the\nobservations, with no significant variations with spatial resolution or\nchemical model, except in the case of the unrealistic model with constant CO\nabundance. The velocity-size relation is slightly too steep for some of the\nmodels, while the mass-size relation is a bit too shallow for all models only\nat a spatial resolution $dx\\approx 1$ pc. The normalizations of the Larson\nrelations show a clear dependence on spatial resolution, for both the synthetic\nand the real MCs. The comparison of the velocity-size normalization suggests\nthat the SN rate in the Perseus arm is approximately 70\\% or less of the rate\nadopted in the simulation. Overall, the realistic properties of the synthetic\nclouds confirm that supernova-driven turbulence can explain the origin and\ndynamics of MCs.\n", "  EGB 6 is a faint, large, ancient planetary nebula (PN). Its central star, a\nhot DAOZ white dwarf (WD), is a prototype of a rare class of PN nuclei\nassociated with dense, compact emission-line knots. The central star also shows\nexcess fluxes in both the near- (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR). In a 2013 paper,\nwe used Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to show that the compact nebula is\na point-like source, located 0\".16 (~118 AU) from the WD. We attributed the NIR\nexcess to an M dwarf companion star, which appeared to coincide with the dense\nemission knot. We now present new ground-based NIR spectroscopy, showing that\nthe companion is actually a much cooler source with a continuous spectrum,\napparently a dust-enshrouded low-luminosity star. New HST images confirm common\nproper motion of the emission knot and red source with the WD. The I-band, NIR,\nand MIR fluxes are variable, possibly on timescales as short as days. We can\nfit the spectral-energy distribution with four blackbodies (the WD, a ~1850 K\nNIR component, and MIR dust at 385 and 175 K). Alternatively, we show that the\nNIR/MIR SED is very similar to that of Class 0/I young stellar objects. We\nsuggest a scenario in which the EGB 6 nucleus is descended from a wide binary\nsimilar to the Mira system, in which a portion of the wind from an AGB star was\ncaptured into an accretion disk around a companion star; a remnant of this disk\nhas survived to the present time, and is surrounded by gas photoionized by UV\nradiation from the WD.\n", "  Emulsion detectors feature a very high position resolution and consequently\nrepresent an ideal device when particle detection is required at the\nmicrometric scale. This is the case of quantum interferometry studies with\nantimatter, where micrometric fringes have to be measured. In this framework,\nwe designed and realized a new emulsion based detector characterized by a gel\nenriched in terms of silver bromide crystal contents poured on a glass plate.\nWe tested the sensitivity of such a detector to low energy positrons in the\nrange 10-20 keV. The obtained results prove that nuclear emulsions are highly\nefficient at detecting positrons at these energies. This achievement paves the\nway to perform matter-wave interferometry with positrons using this technology.\n", "  We present a multi-epoch hard X-ray analysis of Cygnus X-1 in its soft state\nbased on four observations with NuSTAR. Despite the basic similarity of the\nobserved spectra, there is clear spectral variability between epochs. To\ninvestigate this variability, we construct a model incorporating both the\nstandard disk-corona continuum and relativistic reflection from the accretion\ndisk, based on prior NuSTAR work on Cygnus X-1, and apply this model to each\nepoch independently. We find excellent consistency for the black hole spin, and\nthe iron abundance of the accretion disk, which are expected to remain constant\non observational timescales. In particular, we confirm that Cygnus X-1 hosts a\nrapidly rotating black hole, 0.93<a*<0.96, in broad agreement with the majority\nof prior studies of the relativistic disk reflection and constraints on the\nspin obtained through studies of the thermal accretion disk continuum. Our work\nalso confirms the apparent misalignment between the inner disk and the orbital\nplane of the binary system reported previously, finding the magnitude of this\nwarp to be ~10-15deg. This level of misalignment does not significantly change\n(and may even improve) the agreement between our reflection results and the\nthermal continuum results regarding the black hole spin. The spectral\nvariability observed by NuSTAR is dominated by the primary continuum, implying\nvariability in the temperature of the scattering electron plasma. Finally, we\nconsistently observe absorption from ionized iron at ~6.7 keV, which varies in\nstrength as a function of orbital phase in a manner consistent with the\nabsorbing material being an ionized phase of the focused stellar wind from the\nsupergiant companion star.\n", "  We investigate the footpoints of four erupted magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that\nappear as sigmoidal hot channels prior to the eruptions in the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly high temperaure passbands. The simultaneous Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager observations disclose that one footpoint of the MFRs originates\nin the penumbra or penumbra edge with a stronger magnetic field, while the\nother in the moss region with a weaker magnetic field. The significant\ndeviation of the axis of the MFRs from the main polarity inversion lines and\nassociated filaments suggests that the MFRs have ascended to a high altitude,\nthus being distinguishable from the source sigmoidal ARs. The more interesting\nthing is that, with the eruption of the MFRs, the average inclination angle and\ndirect current at the footpoints with stronger magnetic field tend to decrease,\nwhich is suggestive of a straightening and untwisting of the magnetic field in\nthe MFR legs. Moreover, the associated flare ribbons also display an\ninteresting evolution. They initially appear as sporadical brightenings at the\ntwo footpoints of and in the regions below the MFRs and then quickly extend to\ntwo slender sheared J-shaped ribbons with the two hooks corresponding to the\ntwo ends of the MFRs. Finally, the straight parts of the two ribbons separate\nfrom each other, evolving into two widened parallel ones. These features mostly\nconforms to and supports the recently proposed three-dimensional standard\nCME/flare model, i.e., the twisted MFR eruption stretches and leads to the\nreconnection of the overlying field that transits from a strong to weak shear\nwith the increasing height.\n", "  The recent work by Iha et al shows an upper bound on mass anomalous dimension\n$\\gamma_m$ of multi-flavor massless QCD at the renormalization group fixed\npoint from the conformal bootstrap in $SU(N_F)_V$ symmetric conformal field\ntheories under the assumption that the fixed point is realizable with the\nlattice regularization based on staggered fermions. We show that the almost\nidentical but slightly stronger bound applies to the regularization based on\nWilson fermions (or domain wall fermions) by studying the conformal bootstrap\nin $SU(N_f)_L \\times SU(N_f)_R$ symmetric conformal field theories. For\n$N_f=8$, our bound implies $\\gamma_m < 1.31$ to avoid dangerously irrelevant\noperators that are not compatible with the lattice symmetry.\n", "  We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) detections of high-energy\n(>100 MeV) gamma-ray emission from two recent optically bright classical novae,\nV1369 Centauri 2013 and V5668 Sagittarii 2015. At early times, Fermi\ntarget-of-opportunity observations prompted by their optical discoveries\nprovided enhanced LAT exposure that enabled the detections of gamma-ray onsets\nbeginning ~2 days after their first optical peaks. Significant gamma-ray\nemission was found extending to 39-55 days after their initial LAT detections,\nwith systematically fainter and longer duration emission compared to previous\ngamma-ray detected classical novae. These novae were distinguished by multiple\nbright optical peaks that encompassed the timespans of the observed gamma rays.\nThe gamma-ray light curves and spectra of the two novae are presented along\nwith representative hadronic and leptonic models, and comparisons to other\nnovae detected by the LAT are discussed.\n", "  Motivated by the recent excess in the diphoton invariant mass near 750 GeV,\nwe explore a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model that includes the\nminimal set of superpartners as well as additional Dirac partner chiral\nsuperfields in the adjoint representation for each gauge group. The bino\npartner pseudoscalar is identified as the 750 GeV resonance, while\nsuperpotential interactions between it and the gluino (wino) partners yield\nproduction via gluon fusion (decay to photon pairs) at one-loop. The gauginos\nand these additional adjoint superpartners are married by a Dirac mass and must\nalso have Majorana masses. While a large wino partner Majorana mass is\nnecessary to explain the excess, the gluino can be approximately Dirac-like,\nproviding benefits consistent with being both \"supersoft\" (loop corrections to\nthe scalar masses from Dirac gauginos are free of logarithmic enhancements) and\n\"supersafe\" (the experimental limits on the squark/gluino masses can be relaxed\ndue to the reduced production rate). Consistency with the measured Standard\nModel-like Higgs boson mass is imposed, and a numerical exploration of the\nparameter space is provided. Models that can account for the diphoton excess\nare additionally characterized by having couplings that can remain perturbative\nup to very high scales, while remaining consistent with experimental\nconstraints, the Higgs boson mass, and an electroweak scale which is not\nexcessively fine tuned.\n", "  We present the results of a new search for galaxy-scale strong lensing\nsystems in CFHTLS Wide. Our lens-finding technique involves a preselection of\npotential lens galaxies, applying simple cuts in size and magnitude. We then\nperform a Principal Component Analysis of the galaxy images, ensuring a clean\nremoval of the light profile. Lensed features are searched for in the residual\nimages using the clustering topometric algorithm DBSCAN. We find 1098 lens\ncandidates that we inspect visually, leading to a cleaned sample of 109 new\nlens candidates. Using realistic image simulations we estimate the completeness\nof our sample and show that it is independent of source surface brightness,\nEinstein ring size (image separation) or lens redshift. We compare the\nproperties of our sample to previous lens searches in CFHTLS. Including the\npresent search, the total number of lenses found in CFHTLS amounts to 678,\nwhich corresponds to ~4 lenses per square degree down to i=24.8. This is\nequivalent to ~ 60.000 lenses in total in a survey as wide as Euclid, but at\nthe CFHTLS resolution and depth.\n", "  Recently, the first association between an ultra-long gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nand a supernova is reported, i.e., GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl, which enables us to\ninvestigate the physics of central engines or even progenitors for ultra-long\nGRBs. In this paper, we inspect the broad-band data of GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl.\nThe late-time X-ray lightcurve exhibits a GRB 121027A-like fall-back bump,\nsuggesting a black hole central engine. We thus propose a collapsar model with\nfall-back accretion for GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl. The required model parameters,\nsuch as the total mass and radius of the progenitor star, suggest that the\nprogenitor of GRB 111209A is more likely a Wolf-Rayet star instead of blue\nsupergiant, and the central engine of this ultra-long burst is a black hole.\nThe implications of our results is discussed.\n", "  We present observations and dust tail models of activated asteroid P/2015 X6\nfrom deep imaging data acquired at the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC)\nfrom mid-December 2015 to late January 2016. The results of the modeling\nindicate that the asteroid has undergone a sustained dust loss over a two-month\nor longer period. The dust parameters, derived from multidimensional fits of\nthe available images, are compatible with either ice sublimation or rotational\ninstability processes. An impulsive event, as it could be associated to an\nimpact with another body, is less likely. A power-law distribution of\nparticles, with minimum and maximum radius of 1 $\\mu$m and 1 cm, and power\nindex of --3.3 is found to be consistent with the observations. Depending on\nthe ejection velocity model adopted, the particle velocities are found in the\n0.3 to 10 m s$^{-1}$ range. The activation time was between 18-26 days before\ndiscovery. The total ejected mass from that time to the most recent observation\nis in the range 5-9$\\times$10$^6$ kg. No dust features giving indication of\npast activity earlier than the activation time have been observed.\n", "  As an interpretation of the 750 GeV diphoton excesses recently reported by\nboth ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we consider a simple extension of the\nStandard Model with a Dirac fermion dark matter where a singlet complex scalar\nfield mediates between dark matter and SM particles via effective couplings to\nSM gauge bosons and/or Higgs-portal. In this model, we can accommodate the\ndiphoton events through the direct and/or cascade decays of pseudo-scalar and\nreal scalar partners of the complex scalar field. We show that mono-jet\nsearches and gamma-ray observations are complementary in constraining the\nregion where the width of the diphoton resonance can be enhanced due to the\ncouplings of the resonance to dark matter and the correct relic density is\nobtained. In the case of cascade decay of the resonance, the effective\ncouplings of singlet scalars can be smaller, but the model is still testable by\nthe future discrimination between single photon and photon-jet at the LHC as\nwell as the gamma-ray searches for the cascade annihilation of dark matter.\n", "  The recently discovered brown dwarf WISE 0855 presents our first opportunity\nto directly study an object outside the Solar System that is nearly as cold as\nour own gas giant planets. However the traditional methodology for\ncharacterizing brown dwarfs---near infrared spectroscopy---is not currently\nfeasible as WISE 0855 is too cold and faint. To characterize this frozen\nextrasolar world we obtained a 4.5-5.2 $\\mu$m spectrum, the same bandpass long\nused to study Jupiter's deep thermal emission. Our spectrum reveals the\npresence of atmospheric water vapor and clouds, with an absorption profile that\nis strikingly similar to Jupiter. The spectrum is high enough quality to allow\nthe investigation of dynamical and chemical processes that have long been\nstudied in Jupiter's atmosphere, but now on an extrasolar world.\n", "  The composition of planetary solids and gases is largely rooted in the\nprocessing of volatile elements in protoplanetary disks. To shed light on the\nkey processes, we carry out a comparative analysis of the gas-phase carbon\nabundance in two systems with a similar age and disk mass, but different\ncentral stars: HD 100546 and TW Hya. We combine our recent detections of\nC$^{0}$ in these disks with observations of other carbon reservoirs (CO,\nC$^{+}$, C$_{2}$H) and gas mass and warm gas tracers (HD, O$^{0}$), as well as\nspatially resolved ALMA observations and the spectral energy distribution. The\ndisks are modelled with the DALI 2D physical-chemical code. Stellar abundances\nfor HD 100546 are derived from archival spectra. Upper limits on HD emission\nfrom HD 100546 place an upper limit on the total disk mass of\n$\\leq0.1\\,M_{\\odot}$. The gas-phase carbon abundance in the atmosphere of this\nwarm Herbig disk is at most moderately depleted compared to the interstellar\nmedium, with [C]/[H]$_{\\rm gas}=(0.1-1.5)\\times 10^{-4}$. HD 100546 itself is a\n$\\lambda\\,$Bo\\\"{o}tis star, with solar abundances of C and O but a strong\ndepletion of rock-forming elements. In the gas of the T Tauri disk TW Hya, both\nC and O are strongly underabundant, with [C]/[H]$_{\\rm gas}=(0.2-5.0)\\times\n10^{-6}$ and C/O${>}1$. We discuss evidence that the gas-phase C and O\nabundances are high in the warm inner regions of both disks. Our analytical\nmodel, including vertical mixing and a grain size distribution, reproduces the\nobserved [C]/[H]$_{\\rm gas}$ in the outer disk of TW Hya and allows to make\npredictions for other systems.\n", "  We present a new class of unified models based on SO(10) symmetry which\nprovides insights into the masses and mixings of quarks and leptons, including\nthe neutrinos. The key feature of our proposal is the absence of Higgs boson\n10_H belonging to the fundamental representation that is normally employed.\nFlavor mixing is induced via vector-like fermions in the 16 + 16-bar\nrepresentation. A variety of scenarios, both supersymmetric and otherwise, are\nanalyzed involving a 126_H along with either a 45_H or a 210_H of Higgs boson\nemployed for symmetry breaking. It is shown that this framework, with only a\nlimited number of parameters, provides an excellent fit to the full fermion\nspectrum, utilizing either type-I or type-II seesaw mechanism. These flavor\nmodels can be potentially tested and distinguished in their predictions for\nproton decay branching ratios, which are analyzed.\n", "  We investigate the electronic properties of the tetragonal FeS superconductor\nby using scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. It is found that the\ntypical tunneling spectrum on the top layer of sulfur can be nicely fitted with\nan anisotropic s-wave or a combination of two superconducting components in\nwhich one may have a highly anisotropic or nodal like superconducting gap. The\nfittings lead to the maximum superconducting gap $\\Delta_{max}\\approx$\n0.90$\\;$meV, which yields a ratio of 2$\\Delta_{max}/k_BT_c\\approx$ 4.65. This\nvalue is larger than that of the predicted value 3.53 by the BCS theory in the\nweak coupling limit, indicating a strong coupling superconductivity. Two kinds\nof defects are observed on the surface, which can be assigned to the defects on\nthe S sites (four-fold image) and Fe sites (dumbbell shape). Impurity induced\nresonance states are found only for the former defects and stay at zero-bias\nenergy.\n", "  We present our experimental investigation of an optical Raman transition\nbetween the magnetic clock states of $^{87}$Rb in an atom chip magnetic trap.\nThe transfer of atomic population is induced by a pair of diode lasers which\ncouple the two clock states off-resonantly to an intermediate state manifold.\nThis transition is subject to destructive interference of two excitation paths,\nwhich leads to a reduction of the effective two-photon Rabi-frequency.\nFurthermore, we find that the transition frequency is highly sensitive to the\nintensity ratio of the diode lasers. Our results are well described in terms of\nlight shifts in the multi-level structure of $^{87}$Rb. The differential light\nshifts vanish at an optimal intensity ratio, which we observe as a narrowing of\nthe transition linewidth. We also observe the temporal dynamics of the\npopulation transfer and find good agreement with a model based on the system's\nmaster equation and a Gaussian laser beam profile. Finally, we identify several\nsources of decoherence in our system, and discuss possible improvements.\n", "  The low-energy dynamics of relativistic continuous media is given by a\nshift-symmetric effective theory of four scalar fields. These scalars describe\nthe embedding in spacetime of the medium and play the role of St\\\"uckelberg\nfields for spontaneously broken spatial and time translations. Perfect fluids\nare selected imposing a stronger symmetry group or reducing the field content\nto a single scalar. We explore the relation between the field theory\ndescription of perfect fluids to thermodynamics. By drawing the correspondence\nbetween the allowed operators at leading order in derivatives and the\nthermodynamic variables, we find that a complete thermodynamic picture requires\nthe four Stuckelberg fields. We show that thermodynamic stability plus the\nnull-energy condition imply dynamical stability. We also argue that a\nconsistent thermodynamic interpretation is not possible if any of the shift\nsymmetries is explicitly broken.\n", "  We analyzed deep $Chandra$ ACIS-I exposures of the cluster-scale X-ray halo\nsurrounding the radio source 4C+37.11. This remarkable system hosts the closest\nresolved pair of super-massive black hole and an exceptionally luminous\nelliptical galaxy, the likely product of a series of past mergers. We\ncharacterize the halo with $r_{500} = 0.95$ Mpc, $M_{500} = (2.5 \\pm 0.2)\n\\times 10^{14} \\ M_{\\rm{\\odot}}$, $ kT = 4.6\\pm 0.2$ keV, and a gas mass of\n$M_{\\rm g,500} = (2.2 \\pm 0.1) \\times 10^{13} M_\\odot$. The gas mass fraction\nwithin $r_{500}$ is $f_{\\rm g} = 0.09 \\pm 0.01$. The entropy profile shows\nlarge non-gravitational heating in the central regions. We see several surface\nbrightness jumps, associated with substantial temperature and density changes,\nbut approximate pressure equilibrium, implying that these are sloshing\nstructures driven by a recent merger. A residual intensity image shows core\nspiral structure closely matching that seen for the Perseus cluster, although\nat $z=0.055$ the spiral pattern is less distinct. We infer the most recent\nmerger occurred $1-2$ Gyr ago and that the event that brought the two observed\nsuper-massive black holes to the system core is even older. Under that\ninterpretation, this black hole binary pair has, unusually, remained at\npc-scale separation for more than 2 Gyr.\n", "  FeSe is an iron-based superconductor of immense current interest due to the\nlarge enhancements of Tc that occur when it is pressurized or grown as a single\nlayer on an insulating substrate. Here we report precision measurements of its\nsuperconducting electrodynamics, at frequencies of 202 and 658 MHz and at\ntemperatures down to 0.1 K. The quasiparticle conductivity reveals a rapid\ncollapse in scattering on entering the superconducting state that is strongly\nreminiscent of unconventional superconductors such as cuprates, organics and\nthe heavy fermion material CeCoIn5. At the lowest temperatures the\nquasiparticle mean free path exceeds 50 micron, a record for a compound\nsuperconductor. From the superfluid response we confirm the importance of\nmultiband superconductivity and reveal strong evidence for a finite energy-gap\nminimum.\n", "  We construct the canonical action of a Carroll string doing the Carroll limit\nof a canonical relativistic string. We also study the Killing symmetries of the\nCarroll string, which close under an infinite dimensional algebra. The\ntensionless limit and the Carroll $p$-brane action are also discussed.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the N-particle system evolving in the XY hamiltonian\nmean field (HMF) model for a repulsive potential, when no phase transition\noccurs. Starting from a homogeneous distribution, particles evolve in a mean\nfield created by the interaction with all others. This interaction does not\nchange the homogeneous state of the system, and particle motion is\napproximately ballistic with small corrections. For initial particle data\napproaching a waterbag, it is explicitly proved that corrections to the\nballistic velocities are in the form of independent brownian noises over a time\nscale diverging not slower than $N^{2/5}$ as $N \\to \\infty$, which proves the\npropagation of molecular chaos. Molecular dynamics simulations of the XY-HMF\nmodel confirm our analytical findings.\n", "  Delay differential equations take into account the transmission time of the\ninformation. These delayed signals may turn a predictable system into chaotic,\nwith the usual fractalization of the phase space. In this work, we study the\nconnection between delay and unpredictability, in particular we focus on the\nWada property in systems with delay. This topological property gives rise to\ndramatical changes in the final state for small changes in the history\nfunctions.\n", "  Basis set incompleteness error and finite size error can manifest\nconcurrently in systems for which the two effects are phenomenologically\nwell-separated in length scale. When this is true, we need not necessarily\nremove the two sources of error simultaneously. Instead, the errors can be\nfound and remedied in different parts of the basis set. This would be of great\nbenefit to a method such as coupled cluster theory since the combined cost of\n$n_{occ}^6 n_{virt}^4$ could be separated into $n_{occ}^6$ and $n_{virt}^4$\ncosts with smaller prefactors. In this Communication, we present analysis on a\ndata set due to Baardsen and coworkers, containing coupled cluster doubles\nenergies for the 2DEG for $r_s=$ 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 a.u.~at a wide range of basis\nset sizes and particle numbers. In obtaining complete basis set limit\nthermodynamic limit results, we find that within a small and removable error\nthe above assertion is correct for this simple system. This approach allows for\nthe combination of methods which separately address finite size effects and\nbasis set incompleteness error.\n", "  We present chemical abundance measurements of two metal-poor red giant stars\nin the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Bootes I, based on Magellan/MIKE\nhigh-resolution spectra. For Boo I-980, with [Fe/H]=-3.1, we present the first\nelemental abundance measurements while Boo I-127, with [Fe/H]=-2.0, shows\nabundances in good agreement with previous measurements. Light and iron-peak\nelement abundance ratios in the two Bootes I stars, as well as those of most\nother Boootes I members, collected from the literature, closely resemble those\nof regular metal-poor halo stars. Neutron-capture element abundances Sr and Ba\nare systematically lower than the main halo trend, and also show a significant\nabundance spread. Overall, this is similar to what has been found for other\nultra-faint dwarf galaxies. We apply corrections to the carbon abundances\n(commensurate with stellar evolutionary status) of the entire sample and find\n21% of stars to be carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, compared to 13%\nwithout using the carbon correction. We reassess the metallicity distribution\nfunctions (MDF) for the CEMP stars and non-CEMP stars, and confirm earlier\nclaims that CEMP stars might belong to a different, earlier population.\nApplying a set of abundance criteria to test to what extent Bootes I could be a\nsurviving first galaxy suggests that it is one of the earliest assembled\nsystems that perhaps received gas from accretion from other clouds in the\nsystem, or from swallowing a first galaxy or building block type object. This\nresulted in the two stellar populations observable today.\n", "  We study the magnetic anisotropy which arises at the interface between a thin\nfilm ferromagnet and a 3-d Rashba material. The 3-d Rashba material is\ncharacterized by the spin-orbit strength $\\alpha$ and the direction of broken\nbulk inversion symmetry $\\hat n$. We find an in-plane uniaxial anisotropy in\nthe $\\hat{z}\\times\\hat{n}$ direction, where $\\hat z$ is the interface normal.\nFor realistic values of $\\alpha$, the uniaxial anisotropy is of a similar order\nof magnitude as the bulk magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Evaluating the uniaxial\nanisotropy for a simplified model in 1-d shows that for small band filling, the\nin-plane easy axis anisotropy scales as $\\alpha^4$ and results from a twisted\nexchange interaction between the spins in the 3-d Rashba material and the\nferromagnet. For a ferroelectric 3-d Rashba material, $\\hat n$ can be\ncontrolled with an electric field, and we propose that the interfacial magnetic\nanisotropy could provide a mechanism for electrical control of the magnetic\norientation.\n", "  We use the effects of mass segregation on the radial distribution of\ndifferent stellar populations in the core of 47 Tucanae to find estimates for\nthe masses of stars at different post main sequence evolutionary stages. We\ntake samples of main sequence (MS) stars from the core of 47 Tucanae, at\ndifferent magnitudes (i.e. different masses), and use the effects of this\ndynamical process to develop a relation between the radial distance (RD) at\nwhich the cumulative distribution reaches the 20th and 50th percentile, and\nstellar mass. From these relations we estimate the masses of different post MS\npopulations. We find that mass remains constant for stars going through the\nevolutionary stages between the upper MS up to the horizontal branch (HB). By\ncomparing RDs of the HB stars with stars of lower masses, we can exclude a mass\nloss greater than 0.09M during the red giant branch (RGB) stage at nearly the\n3{\\sigma} level. The slightly higher mass estimates for the asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) are consistent with the AGB having evolved from somewhat more\nmassive stars. The AGB also exhibits evidence of contamination by more massive\nstars, possibly blue stragglers (BSS), going through the RGB phase. We do not\ninclude the BSS in this paper due to the complexity of these objects, instead,\nthe complete analysis of this population is left for a companion paper. The\nprocess to estimate the masses described in this paper are exclusive to the\ncore of 47 Tuc.\n", "  We report the discovery of a `Triple-Double Radio Galaxy (TDRG)' J1216+0709\ndetected in deep low-frequency Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)\nobservations. J1216+0709 is only the third radio galaxy, after B0925+420 and\nSpeca, with three pairs of lobes resulting from three different episodes of AGN\njet activity. The 610 MHz GMRT image clearly displays an inner pair of lobes, a\nnearly co-axial middle pair of lobes and a pair of outer lobes that is bent\nw.r.t. the axis of inner pair of lobes. The total end-to-end projected sizes of\nthe inner, middle, and outer lobes are 40$^{{\\prime}{\\prime}}$ ($\\sim$ 95 kpc),\n1$^{\\prime}$.65 ($\\sim$ 235 kpc) and 5$^{\\prime}$.7 ($\\sim$ 814 kpc),\nrespectively. Unlike the outer pair of lobes both the inner and middle pairs of\nlobes exhibit asymmetries in arm-lengths and flux densities, but in opposite\nsense, i.e., the eastern sides are farther and also brighter that the western\nsides, thus suggesting the possibility of jet being intrinsically asymmetric\nrather than due to relativistic beaming effect. The host galaxy is a bright\nelliptical (m$_{\\rm r}$ $\\sim$ 16.56) with M$_{\\rm SMBH}$ $\\sim$ 3.9 $\\times$\n10$^{9}$ M$\\odot$ and star-formation rate of $\\sim$ 4.66$_{\\rm -1.61}^{\\rm\n+4.65}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The host galaxy resides is a small group of\nthree galaxies (m$_{\\rm r}$ $\\leq$ 17.77) and is possibly going through the\ninteraction with faint, dwarf galaxies in the neighbourhood, which may have\ntriggered the recent episodes of AGN activity.\n", "  In this paper we analyse the double vector meson production in photon --\nhadron ($\\gamma h$) interactions at $pp/pA/AA$ collisions and present\npredictions for the $\\rho\\rho$, $J/\\Psi J/\\Psi$ and $\\rho J/\\Psi$ production\nconsidering the double scattering mechanism. We estimate the total cross\nsections and rapidity distributions at LHC energies and compare our results\nwith the predictions for the double vector meson production in $\\gamma \\gamma$\ninteractions at hadronic colliders. We present predictions for the different\nrapidity ranges probed by the ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb Collaborations. Our\nresults demonstrate that the $\\rho\\rho$ and $J/\\Psi J/\\Psi$ production in\n$PbPb$ collisions is dominated by the double scattering mechanism, while the\ntwo - photon mechanism dominates in $pp$ collisions. Moreover, our results\nindicate that the analysis of the $\\rho J/\\Psi$ production at LHC can be useful\nto constrain the double scattering mechanism.\n", "  The dust emissivity spectral index, $\\beta$, is a critical parameter for\nderiving the mass and temperature of star-forming structures, and consequently\ntheir gravitational stability. The $\\beta$ value is dependent on various dust\ngrain properties, such as size, porosity, and surface composition, and is\nexpected to vary as dust grains evolve. Here we present $\\beta$, dust\ntemperature, and optical depth maps of the star-forming clumps in the Perseus\nMolecular Cloud determined from fitting SEDs to combined Herschel and JCMT\nobservations in the 160 $\\mu$m, 250 $\\mu$m, 350 $\\mu$m, 500 $\\mu$m, and 850\n$\\mu$m bands. Most of the derived $\\beta$, and dust temperature values fall\nwithin the ranges of 1.0 - 2.7 and 8 - 20 K, respectively. In Perseus, we find\nthe $\\beta$ distribution differs significantly from clump to clump, indicative\nof grain growth. Furthermore, we also see significant, localized $\\beta$\nvariations within individual clumps and find low $\\beta$ regions correlate with\nlocal temperature peaks, hinting at the possible origins of low $\\beta$ grains.\nThroughout Perseus, we also see indications of heating from B stars and\nembedded protostars, as well evidence of outflows shaping the local landscape.\n", "  We study the motion of a solid particle immersed in a Newtonian fluid and\nconfined between two parallel elastic membranes possessing shear and bending\nrigidity. The hydrodynamic mobility depends on the frequency of the particle\nmotion due to the elastic energy stored in the membrane. Unlike the\nsingle-membrane case, a coupling between shearing and bending exists. The\ncommonly used approximation of superposing two single-membrane contributions is\nfound to give reasonable results only for motions in the parallel, but not in\nthe perpendicular direction. We also compute analytically the membrane\ndeformation resulting from the motion of the particle, showing that the\npresence of the second membrane reduces deformation. Using the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem we compute the Brownian motion of the particle,\nfinding a long-lasting subdiffusive regime at intermediate time scales. We\nfinally assess the accuracy of the employed point-particle approximation via\nboundary-integral simulations for a truly extended particle. They are found to\nbe in excellent agreement with the analytical predictions.\n", "  We investigate the dust energy balance for the edge-on galaxy IC 2531, one of\nthe seven galaxies in the HEROES sample. We perform a state-of-the-art\nradiative transfer modelling based, for the first time, on a set of optical and\nnear-infrared galaxy images. We show that taking into account near-infrared\nimaging in the modelling significantly improves the constraints on the\nretrieved parameters of the dust content. We confirm the result from previous\nstudies that including a young stellar population in the modelling is important\nfor explaining the observed stellar energy distribution. However, the\ndiscrepancy between the observed and modelled thermal emission at far-infrared\nwavelengths, the so-called dust energy balance problem, is still present: the\nmodel underestimates the observed fluxes by a factor of about two. We compare\ntwo different dust models, and find that dust parameters and thus the spectral\nenergy distribution in the infrared domain are sensitive to the adopted dust\nmodel. In general, the THEMIS model reproduces the observed emission in the\ninfrared wavelength domain better than the popular Zubko et al. BARE-GR-S\nmodel. Our study of IC 2531 is a pilot case for detailed and uniform radiative\ntransfer modelling of the entire HEROES sample, which will shed more light on\nthe strength and origins of the dust energy balance problem.\n", "  We present the results from a systematic search for galactic-scale, molecular\n(OH 119 $\\mu$m) outflows in a sample of 52 Local Volume ($d < 50$ Mpc) Burst\nAlert Telescope detected active galactic nuclei (BAT AGN) with\n\\emph{Herschel}-PACS. We combine the results from our analysis of the BAT AGN\nwith the published \\emph{Herschel}/PACS data of 43 nearby ($z<0.3$) galaxy\nmergers, mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and QSOs. The objects\nin our sample of BAT AGN have, on average, $\\sim 10-100$ times lower AGN\nluminosities, star formation rates (SFRs), and stellar masses than those of the\nULIRG and QSO sample. OH 119 $\\mu$m is detected in 42 of our BAT AGN targets.\nEvidence for molecular outflows (i.e. OH absorption profiles with median\nvelocities more blueshifted than $-$50 km s$^{-1}$ and/or blueshifted wings\nwith 84-percentile velocities less than $-$300 km s$^{-1}$) is seen in only\nfour BAT AGN (NGC~7479 is the most convincing case). Evidence for molecular\ninflows (i.e. OH absorption profiles with median velocities more redshifted\nthan 50 km s$^{-1}$) is seen in seven objects, although an inverted P-Cygni\nprofile is detected unambiguously in only one object (Circinus). Our data show\nthat both the starburst and AGN contribute to driving OH outflows, but the\nfastest OH winds require AGN with quasar-like luminosities. We also confirm\nthat the total absorption strength of OH 119 $\\mu$m is a good proxy for dust\noptical depth as it correlates strongly with the 9.7 $\\mu$m silicate absorption\nfeature, a measure of obscuration originating in both the nuclear torus and\nhost galaxy disk.\n", "  It is well known that two-dimensional macroscale shear flows are susceptible\nto instabilities leading to macroscale vortical structures. The linear and\nnonlinear fate of such a macroscale flow in a strongly coupled medium is a\nfundamental problem. A popular example of a strongly coupled medium is a dusty\nplasma, often modelled as a Yukawa liquid. Recently, laboratory experiments and\nMD studies of shear flows in strongly coupled Yukawa liquids, indicated\noccurrence of strong molecular shear heating, which is found to reduce the\ncoupling strength exponentially leading to destruction of macroscale vorticity.\nTo understand the vortex dynamics of strongly coupled molecular fluids\nundergoing macroscale shear flows and molecular shear heating, MD simulation\nhas been performed, which allows the macroscopic vortex dynamics to evolve\nwhile at the same time, \"removes\" the microscopically generated heat without\nusing the velocity degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that by using a\nconfigurational thermostat in a novel way, the microscale heat generated by\nshear flow can be thermostatted out efficiently without compromising the large\nscale vortex dynamics. In present work, using MD simulations, a comparative\nstudy of shear flow evolution in Yukawa liquids in presence and absence of\nmolecular or microscopic heating is presented for a prototype shear flow\nnamely, Kolmogorov flow.\n", "  The presence of excesses of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar\nsystem evidenced in meteorites has been taken as testament to close encounters\nwith exotic nucleosynthetic sources, including supernovae or AGB stars. An\nanalysis of the likelihoods associated with different sources of these extinct\nnuclides in the early solar system indicates that rather than being exotic,\ntheir abundances were typical of star-forming regions like those observed today\nin the Galaxy. The radiochemistry of the early solar system is therefore\nunexceptional, being the consequence of extensive averaging of molecular cloud\nsolids.\n", "  In fractionally filled Landau levels there is only a small energy difference\nbetween broken translational symmetry electron-crystal states and exotic\ncorrelated quantum fluid states. We show that the spatially periodic substrate\ninteraction associated with the long period moir\\'{e} patterns present in\ngraphene on nearly aligned hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) tilts this close\ncompetition in favor of the former, explaining surprising recent experimental\nfindings.\n", "  The most prodigious starburst galaxies are absent in massive galaxy clusters\ntoday, but their connection with large scale environments is less clear at\n$z\\gtrsim2$. We present a search of large scale structure around a galaxy\ncluster core at $z=2.095$ using a set of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies.\nWe find that both color-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and dusty\nstar-forming galaxies (DSFGs) show significant overdensities around the\n$z=2.095$ cluster. A total of 8 DSFGs (including 3 X-ray luminous active\ngalactic nuclei, AGNs) and 34 SFGs are found within a 10 arcmin radius\n(corresponds to $\\sim$15 cMpc at $z\\sim2.1$) from the cluster center and within\na redshift range of $\\Delta z=0.02$, which leads to galaxy overdensities of\n$\\delta_{\\rm DSFG}\\sim12.3$ and $\\delta_{\\rm SFG}\\sim2.8$. The cluster core and\nthe extended DSFG- and SFG-rich structure together demonstrate an active\ncluster formation phase, in which the cluster is accreting a significant amount\nof material from large scale structure while the more mature core may begin to\nvirialize. Our finding of this DSFG-rich structure, along with a number of\nother protoclusters with excess DSFGs and AGNs found to date, suggest that the\noverdensities of these rare sources indeed trace significant mass\noverdensities. However, it remains puzzling how these intense star formers are\ntriggered concurrently. Although an increased probability of galaxy\ninteractions and/or enhanced gas supply can trigger the excess of DSFGs, our\nstacking analysis based on 850 $\\mu$m images and morphological analysis based\non rest-frame optical imaging do not show such enhancements of merger fraction\nand gas content in this structure.\n", "  We present deep H-alpha images of portions of the X-ray bright but optically\nfaint Galactic supernova remnant G156.2+5.7, revealing numerous and delicately\nthin nonradiative filaments which mark the location of the remnant's forward\nshock. These new images show that these filaments have a complex structure not\nvisible on previous lower resolution optical images. By comparing H-alpha\nimages taken in 2004 at the McDonald Observatory and in 2015-2016 at the Kiso\nObservatory, we set a stringent 1-sigma upper limit of expansion to be 0.06\narcsec/yr. This proper motion, combined with a shock speed of 500 km/s inferred\nfrom X-ray spectral analyses, gives a distance of > 1.7 kpc. In addition, a\nsimple comparison of expansion indices of several SNRs allows us to infer the\nage of the remnant to be a few 10,000 yr old. These estimates are more\nstraightforward and reliable than any other previous studies, and clearly rule\nout a possibility that G156.2+5.7 is physically associated with part of the\nTaurus-Auriga cloud and dust complex at a distance of 200-300 pc.\n", "  The $GW$ approach of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) has become a common\ntool for calculating the electronic structure of materials. However, with\nincreasing number of published results, discrepancies between the values\nobtained by different methods and codes become more and more apparent. For a\ntest set of small- and wide-gap semiconductors, we demonstrate how to reach the\nnumerically \\emph{best} electronic structure within the framework of the\nfull-potential linearized augmented planewave (FLAPW) method. We first evaluate\nthe impact of local orbitals in the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue spectrum of the\nunderlying starting point. The role of the basis-set quality is then further\nanalyzed when calculating the $G_0W_0$ quasiparticle energies. Our results,\ncomputed with the \\exciting{} code, are compared to those obtained using the\nprojector-augmented planewave (PAW) formalism, finding overall, good agreement\nbetween both methods. We also provide data produced with a typical FLAPW basis\nset as a benchmark for other $G_0W_0$ implementations.\n", "  We show the existence of a nontrivial topological configuration of the Higgs\nfield in the Standard Model with the Skyrme term. It is shown that the current\nupper bound of the mass of the topological object is about 34 TeV. We discuss\nthe impact of the existence of the topological object on cosmology.\n", "  An analysis of the network defined by the potential energy minima of\nmulti-atomic systems and their connectivity via reaction pathways that go\nthrough transition states allows to understand important characteristics like\nthermodynamic, dynamic and structural properties. Unfortunately computing the\ntransition states and reaction pathways in addition to the significant\nenergetically low-lying local minima is a computationally demanding task. We\nhere introduce a computationally efficient method that is based on a\ncombination of the minima hopping global optimization method and the insight\nthat uphill barriers tend to increase with increasing structural distances of\nthe educt and product states. This method allows to replace the exact\nconnectivity information and transition state energies with alternative and\napproximate concepts. Without adding any significant additional cost to the\nminima hopping global optimization approach, this method allows to generate an\napproximate network of the minima, their connectivity and a rough measure for\nthe energy needed for their interconversion. This can be used to obtain a first\nqualitative idea on important physical and chemical properties by means of a\ndisconnectivity graph analysis. Besides the physical insight obtained by such\nan analysis, the gained knowledge can be used to make a decision if it is\nworthwhile or not to invest computational resources for an exact computation of\nthe transition states and the reaction pathways. Furthermore it is demonstrated\nthat the here presented method can be used for finding physically reasonable\ninterconversion pathways that are promising input pathways for methods like\ntransition path sampling or discrete path sampling.\n", "  To-date, all human economic activity has depended on the resources of a\nsingle planet, and it has long been recognized that developments in space\nexploration could in principle open our closed planetary economy to external\nresources of energy and raw materials. Recently, there has been renewed\ninterest in these possibilities, with several private companies established\nwith the stated aim of exploiting extraterrestrial resources. Space science and\nexploration are among the potential beneficiaries of space resources because\ntheir use may permit the construction and operation of scientific facilities in\nspace that will be unaffordable if all the required material and energy\nresources have to be lifted out of Earth's gravity. Examples may include the\nnext generation of large space telescopes, sample return missions to the outer\nSolar System, and human research stations on the Moon and Mars. These potential\nscientific benefits of extraterrestrial resource utilisation were the topic of\na Royal Astronomical Society specialist discussion meeting held on 8 April 2016\nand summarised here.\n", "  Motivated by recent intensive experimental efforts on searching for\nneutrinoless double beta decays, we present a detailed quantitative analysis on\nthe prospect of resolving neutrino mass ordering in the next generation\n$^{76}$Ge-type experiments.\n", "  We present a systematic study of both nuclear radii and binding energies in\n(even) oxygen isotopes from the valley of stability to the neutron drip line.\nBoth charge and matter radii are compared to state-of-the-art {\\it ab initio}\ncalculations along with binding energy systematics. Experimental matter radii\nare obtained through a complete evaluation of the available elastic proton\nscattering data of oxygen isotopes. We show that, in spite of a good\nreproduction of binding energies, {\\it ab initio} calculations with\nconventional nuclear interactions derived within chiral effective field theory\nfail to provide a realistic description of charge and matter radii. A novel\nversion of two- and three-nucleon forces leads to considerable improvement of\nthe simultaneous description of the three observables for stable isotopes, but\nshows deficiencies for the most neutron-rich systems. Thus, crucial challenges\nrelated to the development of nuclear interactions remain.\n", "  Radiation-induced coupling between A and B excitons in ZnO is theoretically\nstudied. Considering the center-of-mass motion of excitons in bulk and thin\nfilm structures, we reveal the eigenmodes of an exciton--radiation coupled\nsystem and the ratio of each excitonic component, which is determined from\ndiagonalization of the self-consistent equation between the polarization and\nthe Maxwell electric field. In particular, in a nano-to-bulk crossover size\nregime, the large interaction volume between multipole-type excitonic waves and\nradiation waves causes radiative coupling between excitons from different\nvalence bands, which leads to an enhancement of the radiative correction. The\nresults presented in this study are in striking contrast with the conventional\nview of the optical response of excitons in ZnO, where A and B excitons are\nindependently assigned to their respective spectral structures. It is also\nclarified that the density of each excitonic component is of a significant\nvalue for attribution of nonlinear optical signals.\n", "  A Kohn-Sham time-dependent local-density-functional scheme is utilized to\npredict attosecond time delays of xenon 4d photoionization that involves the 4d\ngiant dipole resonance and Cooper minimum. The fundamental effect of electron\ncorrelations to uniquely determine the delay at both regions is demonstrated.\nIn particular, for the giant dipole resonance, the delay underpins strong\ncollective effect, emulating the recent prediction at C60 giant plasmon\nresonance [T. Barillot et al, Phys. Rev. A 91, 033413 (2015)]. For the Cooper\nminimum, a qualitative similarity with a photorecombination experiment near\nargon 3p minimum [S. B. Schoun et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 153001 (2014)] is\nfound. The result should encourage attosecond measurements of Xe 4d\nphotoemission.\n", "  Drift chambers operated with helium-based gas mixtures represent a common\nsolution for tracking charged particles keeping the material budget in the\nsensitive volume to a minimum. The drawback of this solution is the worsening\nof the spatial resolution due to primary ionisation fluctuations, which is a\nlimiting factor for high granularity drift chambers like the MEG II tracker. We\nreport on the measurements performed on three different prototypes of the MEG\nII drift chamber aimed at determining the achievable single-hit resolution. The\nprototypes were operated with helium/isobutane gas mixtures and exposed to\ncosmic rays, electron beams and radioactive sources. Direct measurements of the\nsingle hit resolution performed with an external tracker returned a value of\n110 $\\mu$m, consistent with the values obtained with indirect measurements\nperformed with the other prototypes.\n", "  In this paper we study leading neutron production in photon - hadron\ninteractions which take place in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions at large impact\nparameters. Using a model that describes the recent leading neutron data at\nHERA, we consider exclusive vector meson production in association with a\nleading neutron in $pp/pA$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The total cross\nsections and rapidity distributions of $\\rho$, $\\phi$ and $J/\\Psi$ produced\ntogether with a leading neutron are computed. Our results indicate that the\nstudy of these processes is feasible and that it can be used to improve the\nunderstanding of leading neutron processes and of exclusive vector meson\nproduction.\n", "  We present the results for the low energy properties of the infinite\ndimensional t-J model with $J=0$, using $O(\\lambda^2)$ equations of the\nextremely correlated Fermi liquid formalism. The parameter $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$\nis analogous to the inverse spin parameter $1/(2S)$ in quantum magnets. The\npresent analytical scheme allows us to approach the physically most interesting\nregime near the Mott insulating state $n\\lesssim 1$. It overcomes the\nlimitation to low densities $n \\lesssim .7$ of earlier calculations, by\nemploying a variant of the skeleton graph expansion, and a high frequency\ncutoff that is essential for maintaining the known high-T entropy. The\nresulting quasiparticle weight $Z$, the low $\\omega,T $ self energy and the\nresistivity are reported. These are quite close at all densities to the exact\nnumerical results of the $U=\\infty$ Hubbard model, obtained using the dynamical\nmean field theory. The present calculation offers the advantage of generalizing\nto finite $T$ rather easily, and allows the visualization of the loss of\ncoherence of Fermi liquid quasiparticles by raising $T$. The present scheme is\ngeneralizable to finite dimensions and a non vanishing $J$.\n", "  Recent experimental data on elastic scattering of high energy protons show\nthat the critical regime has been reached at LHC energies. The approach to\ncriticality is demonstrated by increase of the ratio of elastic to total cross\nsections from ISR to LHC energies. At LHC it reaches the value which can result\nin principal change of the character of proton interactions. The treatment of\nnew physics of hollowed toroid-like hadrons requires usage of another branch of\nthe unitarity condition. Its further fate is speculated and interpreted with\nthe help of the unitarity condition in combination with present experimental\ndata. The gedanken experiments to distinguish between different possibilities\nare proposed.\n", "  We have entered an era of large spectroscopic surveys in which we can\nmeasure, through automated pipelines, the atmospheric parameters and chemical\nabundances for large numbers of stars. Calibrating these survey pipelines using\na set of \"benchmark stars\" in order to evaluate the accuracy and precision of\nthe provided parameters and abundances is of utmost importance. The recent\nproposed set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars of Heiter et al. (2015) has no\nrecommended stars within the critical metallicity range of $-2.0 <$ [Fe/H] $<\n-1.0$ dex. In this paper, we aim to add candidate Gaia benchmark stars inside\nof this metal-poor gap. We began with a sample of 21 metal-poor stars which was\nreduced to 10 stars by requiring accurate photometry and parallaxes, and\nhigh-resolution archival spectra. The procedure used to determine the stellar\nparameters was similar to Heiter et al. (2015) and Jofre et al. (2014) for\nconsistency. The effective temperature (T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of all candidate\nstars was determined using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band\nphotometry. The surface gravity (log g) was determined through fitting stellar\nevolutionary tracks. The [Fe/H] was determined using four different\nspectroscopic methods fixing the T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and log g from the values\ndetermined independent of spectroscopy. We discuss, star-by-star, the quality\nof each parameter including how it compares to literature, how it compares to a\nspectroscopic run where all parameters are free, and whether Fe I\nionisation-excitation balance is achieved. From the 10 stars, we recommend a\nsample of five new metal-poor benchmark candidate stars which have consistent\nT$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ , log g, and [Fe/H] determined through several means. These\nstars can be used for calibration and validation purpose of stellar parameter\nand abundance pipelines and should be of highest priority for future\ninterferometric studies.\n", "  We present near-IR images of five luminous quasars at z~2 and one at z~4\nobtained with an experimental adaptive optics instrument at the ESO Very Large\nTelescope. The observations are part of a program aimed at demonstrating the\ncapabilities of multi-conjugated adaptive optics imaging combined with the use\nof natural guide stars for high spatial resolution studies on large telescopes.\nThe observations were mostly obtained under poor seeing conditions but in two\ncases. In spite of these non optimal conditions, the resulting images of point\nsources have cores of FWHM ~0.2 arcsec. We are able to characterize the host\ngalaxy properties for 2 sources and set stringent upper limits to the galaxy\nluminosity for the others. We also report on the expected capabilities for\ninvestigating the host galaxies of distant quasars with adaptive optics systems\ncoupled with future Extremely Large Telescopes. Detailed simulations show that\nit will be possible to characterize compact (2-3 kpc) quasar host galaxies for\nQSOs at z = 2 with nucleus K-magnitude spanning from 15 to 20 (corresponding to\nabsolute magnitude -31 to -26) and host galaxies that are 4 mag fainter than\ntheir nuclei.\n", "  (Abridged) We aim at measuring the near-infrared photometry, and deriving the\nmass, age, temperature, and surface gravity of WISE J085510.74-071442.5\n(J0855-0714), which is the coolest known object beyond the Solar System as of\ntoday. We use publicly available data from the archives of the HST and the VLT\nto determine the emission of this source at 1.153 micron (F110W) and 1.575\nmicron (CH_4). J0855-0714 is detected at both wavelengths with signal-to-noise\nratio of ~10 (F110W) and ~4 (CH_4-off) at the peak of the corresponding PSFs.\nThis is the first detection of J0855-0714 in the H-band. We measure 26.31 +/-\n0.10 and 23.22 +/- 0.35 mag in F110W and CH_4 (Vega system). J0855-0714 remains\nunresolved in the HST images that have a spatial resolution of 0.22\".\nCompanions at separations of 0.5 AU (similar brightness) and at ~1 AU (~1 mag\nfainter in the F110W filter) are discarded. By combining the new data with\npublished photometry, we build the spectral energy distribution of J0855-0714\nfrom 0.89 to 22.09 micron, and contrast it against state-of-the-art\nsolar-metallicity models of planetary atmospheres. We determine a temperature\nof 225-250 K, a bolometric luminosity of log L/Lsol = -8.57, and a high surface\ngravity of log g = 5.0 (cm/s2), which suggests an old age although such a high\ngravity is not fully compatible with evolutionary models. After comparison with\nthe cooling theory for brown dwarfs and planets, we infer a mass in the\ninterval 2-10 Mjup for ages of 1-12 Gyr and log g > 3.5 (cm/s2). At the age of\nthe Sun, J0855-0714 would be a ~5-Mjup free-floating planetary-mass object.\nJ0855-0714 may represent the old image of the free-floating planetary-mass\nobjects of similar mass discovered in star-forming regions and young stellar\nclusters. As many J0855-0714-like objects as M5-L2 stars may be expected to\npopulate the solar neighborhood.\n", "  We study the fully entangled fraction of a quantum state. An upper bound is\nobtained for arbitrary bipartite system. This upper bound only depends on the\nFrobenius norm of the state.\n", "  We perform a comparison between the smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics\n(SPMHD) code, Phantom, and the Eulerian grid-based code, Flash, on the\nsmall-scale turbulent dynamo in driven, Mach 10 turbulence. We show, for the\nfirst time, that the exponential growth and saturation of an initially weak\nmagnetic field via the small-scale dynamo can be successfully reproduced with\nSPMHD. The two codes agree on the behaviour of the magnetic energy spectra, the\nsaturation level of magnetic energy, and the distribution of magnetic field\nstrengths during the growth and saturation phases. The main difference is that\nthe dynamo growth rate, and its dependence on resolution, differs between the\ncodes, caused by differences in the numerical dissipation and shock capturing\nschemes leading to differences in the effective Prandtl number in Phantom and\nFlash.\n", "  We compute the leading part of the trace anomaly for a free non-relativistic\nscalar in 2+1 dimensions coupled to a background Newton-Cartan metric. The\nanomaly is proportional to 1/m, where m is the mass of the scalar. We comment\non the implications of a conjectured a-theorem for non-relativistic theories\nwith boost invariance.\n", "  The extraordinary electronic and optical properties of the\ncrystal-to-amorphous transition in phase-change materials led to important\ndevelopments in memory applications. A promising outlook is offered by\nnanoscaling such phase-change structures. Following this research line, we\nstudy the interband optical transmission spectra of nanoscaled\nGeTe/Sb$_2$Te$_3$ chalcogenide superlattice films. We determine, for films with\nvarying stacking sequence and growth methods, the density and scattering time\nof the free electrons, and the characteristics of the valence-to-conduction\ntransition. It is found that the free electron density decreases with\nincreasing GeTe content, for sub-layer thickness below $\\sim$3 nm. A simple\nband model analysis suggests that GeTe and Sb$_2$Te$_3$ layers mix, forming a\nstandard GeSbTe alloy buffer layer. We show that it is possible to control the\nelectronic transport properties of the films by properly choosing the\ndeposition layer thickness and we derive a model for arbitrary film stacks.\n", "  Recently, various examples of asymptotically flat, rotating black holes (BHs)\nwith synchronized hair have been explicitly constructed, including Kerr BHs\nwith scalar or Proca hair, and Myers-Perry BHs with scalar hair and a mass gap,\nshowing there is a general mechanism at work. All these solutions have been\nfound numerically, integrating the fully non-linear field equations of motion\nfrom the event horizon outwards. Here, we address the spacetime geometry of\nthese solutions inside the event horizon. Firstly, we provide arguments, within\nlinear theory, that there is no regular inner horizon for these solutions.\nThen, we address this question fully non-linearly, using as a tractable model\nfive dimensional, equal spinning, Myers-Perry hairy BHs. We find that, for\nnon-extremal solutions: $(1)$ the inside spacetime geometry in the vicinity of\nthe event horizon is smooth and the equations of motion can be integrated\ninwards; $(2)$ before an inner horizon is reached, the spacetime curvature\ngrows (apparently) without bound. In all cases, our results suggest the absence\nof a smooth Cauchy horizon, beyond which the metric can be extended, for hairy\nBHs with synchronized hair.\n", "  Nuclear shell burning in the final stages of the lives of massive stars is\naccompanied by strong turbulent convection. The resulting fluctuations aid\nsupernova explosion by amplifying the non-radial flow in the post-shock region.\nIn this work, we investigate the physical mechanism behind this amplification\nusing a linear perturbation theory. We model the shock wave as a\none-dimensional planar discontinuity and consider its interaction with\nvorticity and entropy perturbations in the upstream flow. We find that, as the\nperturbations cross the shock, their total turbulent kinetic energy is\namplified by a factor of $\\sim\\!2$, while the average linear size of turbulent\neddies decreases by about the same factor. These values are not sensitive to\nthe parameters of the upstream turbulence and the nuclear dissociation\nefficiency at the shock. Finally, we discuss the implication of our results for\nthe supernova explosion mechanism. We show that the upstream perturbations can\ndecrease the critical neutrino luminosity for producing explosion by several\npercent.\n", "  We have measured the far-infrared reflectivity and Kerr angle spectra on a\nhigh-quality crystal of pure semimetallic bismuth as a function of magnetic\nfield, from which we extract the conductivity for left- and right handed\ncircular polarisations. The high spectral resolution allows us to separate the\nintraband Landau level transitions for electrons and holes. The hole transition\nexhibits 100% magnetic circular dichroism, it appears only for one polarisation\nas expected for a circular cyclotron orbit. However the dichroism for electron\ntransitions is reduced to only $13\\pm 1$%, which is quantitatively explained by\nthe large effective mass anisotropy of the electron pockets of the Fermi\nsurface. This observation is a signature of the mismatch between the metric\nexperienced by the photons and the electrons. It allows for a contactless\nmeasurement of the effective mass anisotropy and provides a direction towards\nvalley polarised magneto-optical pumping with elliptically polarised light.\n", "  Observations of the solar surface reveal the presence of flows with length\nscales of around $35$ Mm, commonly referred to as supergranules. Inferring the\nsub-surface flow profile of supergranules from measurements of the surface and\nphotospheric wavefield is an important challenge faced by helioseismology.\nTraditionally, the inverse problem has been approached by studying the linear\nresponse of seismic waves in a horizontally translationally invariant\nbackground to the presence of the supergranule; following an iterative approach\nthat does not depend on horizontal translational invariance might perform\nbetter, since the misfit can be analyzed post iterations. In this work, we\nconstruct synthetic observations using a reference supergranule, and invert for\nthe flow profile using surface measurements of travel-times of waves belonging\nto modal ridges $f$ (surface-gravity) and $p_{1}$ through $p_{7}$ (acoustic).\nWe study the extent to which individual modes and their combinations contribute\nto infer the flow. We show that this method of non-linear iterative inversion\ntends to underestimate the flow velocities as well as inferring a shallower\nflow profile, with significant deviations from the reference supergranule near\nthe surface. We carry out a similar analysis for a sound-speed perturbation and\nfind that analogous near-surface deviations persist, although the iterations\nconverge faster and more accurately. We conclude that a better approach to\ninversion would be to expand the supergranule profile in an appropriate basis,\nthereby reducing the number of parameters being inverted for and appropriately\nregularizing them.\n", "  Spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in three dimensional ($d=3$) quantum\nelectrodynamics is understood as annihilation of an infrared-stable fixed point\nthat describes the large-N conformal phase by another unstable fixed point at a\ncritical number of fermions $N=N_c$. We discuss the root of universality of\n$N_c$ in this picture, together with some features of the phase boundary in the\n$(d,N)$ plane. In particular, it is shown that as $d\\rightarrow 4$,\n$N_c\\rightarrow 0$ with a constant slope, our best estimate of which suggests\nthat $N_c = 2.89$ in $d=3$.\n", "  Symbiotic stars are a heterogeneous class of interacting binaries. Among\nthem, RT Cru has been classified as prototype of a subclass that is\ncharacterised by hard X-ray spectra extending past ~20 keV. We analyse ~8.6 Ms\nof archival INTEGRAL data collected in the period 2003-2014, ~140 ks of\nSwift/XRT data, and a Suzaku observation of 39 ks, to study the spectral X-ray\nemission and investigate the nature of the compact object. Based on the 2MASS\nphotometry, we estimate the distance to the source of 1.2-2.4 kpc. The X-ray\nspectrum obtained with Swift/XRT, JEM-X, IBIS/ISGRI, and Suzaku data is well\nfitted by a cooling flow model modified by an absorber that fully covers the\nsource and two partial covering absorbers. Assuming that the hard X-ray\nemission of RT Cru originates from an optically thin boundary layer around a\nnon-magnetic white dwarf, we estimated a mass of the WD of about 1.2 M_Sun. The\nmass accretion rate obtained for this source might be too high for the\noptically thin boundary layer scenario. Therefore we investigate other\nplausible scenarios to model its hard X-ray emission. We show that,\nalternatively, the observed X-ray spectrum can be explained with the X-ray\nemission from the post-shock region above the polar caps of a magnetised white\ndwarf with mass ~0.9-1.1 M_Sun.\n", "  Aims. We use Fermi and Planck data to calculate the cross correlation between\ngamma ray signal and gas distribution in different scales in giant molecular\nclouds (GMC). Then we investigate the cosmic rays (CRs) penetration in GMCs\nwith these informations.\n  Methods.We use the wavelet technique to decompose both the gamma ray and dust\nopacity maps in different scales, then we calculate the wavelet cross\ncorrelation functions in these scales. We also define wavelet response as an\nanalog to the impulsive response in Fourier transform and calculate that in\ndifferent scales down to Fermi angular resolution.\n  Results. The gamma ray maps above 2 GeV show strong correlation with the dust\nopacity maps, the correlation coefficient is larger than 0.9 above a scale of\n0.4 degree.The derived wavelet response is uniform in different scales.\n  Conclusions. We argue that the CR above 10 GeV can penetrate the giant\nmolecular cloud freely and the CRs distributions in the same energy range are\nuniform down to parsec scale.\n", "  We study the new physics contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay\n($0\\nu\\beta \\beta$) half-life and lepton flavour violation (LFV) amplitude\nwithin the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model (MLRSM).\nConsidering all possible new physics contributions to $0\\nu\\beta \\beta$ and\ncharged lepton flavour violation $\\mu \\rightarrow e \\gamma, \\mu \\rightarrow 3e$\nin MLRSM, we constrain the parameter space of the model from the requirement of\nsatisfying existing experimental bounds. Assuming the breaking scale of the\nleft-right symmetry to be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ TeV accessible at ongoing and near\nfuture collider experiments, we consider the most general type I+II seesaw\nmechanism for the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Choosing the relative\ncontribution of the type II seesaw term allows us to calculate the right handed\nneutrino mass matrix as well as Dirac neutrino mass matrix as a function of the\nmodel parameters, required for the calculation of $0\\nu\\beta \\beta$ and LFV\namplitudes. We show that such a general type I+II seesaw structure results in\nmore allowed parameter space compared to individual type I or type II seesaw\ncases considered in earlier works. In particular, we show that the doubly\ncharged scalar masses $M_{\\Delta}$ are allowed to be smaller than the heaviest\nright handed neutrino mass $M_N$ from the present experimental bounds in these\nscenarios which is in contrast to earlier results with individual type I or\ntype II seesaw showing $M_{\\Delta} > M_N$.\n", "  We present observations of Q1549-C25, an ~L* star-forming galaxy at z=3.15\nfor which Lyman-continuum (LyC) radiation is significantly detected in deep\nKeck/LRIS spectroscopy. We find no evidence for contamination from a\nlower-redshift interloper close to the line of sight in the high\nsignal-to-noise spectrum of Q1549-C25. Furthermore, the morphology of Q1549-C25\nin V_606, J_125, and H_160 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that\nthe object consists of a single, isolated component within 1\". In combination,\nthese data indicate Q1549-C25 as a clean spectroscopic detection of LyC\nradiation, only the second such object discovered to date at z~3. We model the\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of Q1549-C25, finding evidence for\nnegligible dust extinction, an age (assuming continuous star formation) of ~1\nGyr, and a stellar mass of M_*=7.9x10^9 M_sun. Although it is not possible to\nderive strong constraints on the absolute escape fraction of LyC emission,\nf_esc(LyC), from a single object, we use simulations of intergalactic and\ncircumgalactic absorption to infer f_esc(LyC)>=0.51 at 95% confidence. The\ncombination of deep Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and HST imaging is required to\nassemble a larger sample of objects like Q1549-C25, and obtain robust\nconstraints on the average f_esc(LyC) at z~3 and beyond.\n", "  We investigate the properties of microlensing events caused by planetary\nsystems where planets with a moon are widely separated from their host stars.\nFrom this investigation, we find that the moon feature generally appears as an\nvery short-duration perturbation on the smooth asymmetric light curve of the\nlensing event induced by the wide separation planet; thus it can be easily\ndiscriminated from the planet feature responsible for the overall asymmetric\nlight curve. For typical Galactic lensing events with the Einstein radius of\n$\\sim 2$ AU, the asymmetry of the light curves due to bound planets can be\nnoticed up to $\\sim 20$AU. We also find that the perturbations of the wide\nplanetary systems become dominated by the moon as the projected star-planet\nseparation increases, and eventually the light curves of events produced by the\nsystems appear as the single lensing light curve of the planet itself with a\nvery short-duration perturbation induced by the moon, which is a representative\nlight curve of the event induced by a star and a planet, except on the Einstein\ntimescale of the planet. We also study the effect of a finite source star on\nthe moon feature in the wide planetary lensing events. From this study, we find\nthat when the lunar caustic is sufficiently separated from the planetary\ncaustic, the lower limit on the ratio of the lunar caustic size to the source\nradius causing a $\\geq 5\\%$ lunar deviation depends mostly on the projected\nplanet-moon separation regardless of the moon/star mass ratio, and it decreases\nas the planet-moon separation becomes smaller or larger than the planetary\nEinstein radius.\n", "  In strontium titanate, the Froehlich electron - LO-phonon interaction\ndominates the electron response and can also provide superconductivity. Because\nof high LO-phonon frequencies in SrTiO3, the superconducting system is\nnon-adiabatic. We demonstrate that the dielectric function approach is an\nadequate theoretical method for superconductivity in SrTiO3 and on the\nSrTiO3-LaAlO3 interface. The critical temperatures are calculated using\nrealistic material parameters. The obtained critical temperatures are in line\nwith experimental data both for bulk and interface superconductivity. The\npresent method explains the observed multi-dome shape of the critical\ntemperature in SrTiO3 as a function of the electron concentration due to\nmultiband superconductivity.\n", "  We present an analysis of di-hadron correlations using recently developed\nmethods for background subtraction which allow for higher precision\nmeasurements with fewer assumptions about the background. These studies\nindicate that low momentum jets interacting with the medium do not equilibrate\nwith the medium, but rather that interactions with the medium lead to more\nsubtle increases in their widths and fragmentation functions, consistent with\nobservations from studies of higher momentum fully reconstructed jets. The\naway-side shape is not consistent with a Mach cone.\n", "  The spin-helical surface states in three-dimensional topological insulator\n(TI), such as Bi2Se3, are predicted to have superior efficiency in converting\ncharge current into spin polarization. This property is said to be responsible\nfor the giant spin-orbit torques observed in ferromagnetic metal/TI structures.\nIn this work, using first-principles and model tight-binding calculations, we\ninvestigate the interface between the topological insulator Bi2Se3 and\n3d-transition ferromagnetic metals Ni and Co. We find that the difference in\nthe work functions of the topological insulator and the ferromagnetic metals\nshift the topological surface states down about 0.5 eV below the Fermi energy\nwhere the hybridization of these surface states with the metal bands destroys\ntheir helical spin structure. The band alignment of Bi2Se3 and Ni (Co) places\nthe Fermi energy far in the conduction band of bulk Bi2Se3, where the spin of\nthe carriers is aligned with the magnetization in the metal. Our results\nindicate that the topological surface states are unlikely to be responsible for\nthe huge spin-orbit torque effect observed experimentally in these systems.\n", "  First-of-its-kind radio imaging of decameter solar stationary type IV radio\nburst has been presented in this paper. On 6 September 2014 the observations of\ntype IV burst radio emission have been carried out with the two-dimensional\nheliograph based on the Ukrainian T-shaped radio telescope (UTR-2) together\nwith other telescope arrays. Starting at 09:55 UT and throughout 3 hours, the\nradio emission was kept within the observational session of UTR-2. The\ninteresting observation covered the full evolution of this burst, \"from birth\nto death\". During the event lifetime, two C-class solar X-ray flares with peak\ntimes 11:29 UT and 12:24 UT took place. The time profile of this burst in radio\nhas a double-humped shape that can be explained by injection of energetic\nelectrons, accelerated by the two flares, into the burst source. According to\nthe heliographic observations we suggest the burst source was confined within a\nhigh coronal loop, which was a part of a relatively slow coronal mass ejection.\nThe latter has been developed for several hours before the onset of the event.\nThrough analyzing about 1.5 million of heliograms (3700 temporal frames with\n4096 images in each frame that correspond to the number of frequency channels)\nthe radio burst source imaging shows a fascinating dynamical evolution. Both\nspace-based (GOES, SDO, SOHO, STEREO) data and various ground-based\ninstrumentation (ORFEES, NDA, RSTO, NRH) records have been used for this study.\n", "  We provide explicit formulas for the number of vacua of four-dimensional pure\nN=1 super Yang-Mills theories on a circle, with any simple gauge algebra and\nany choice of center and spectrum of line operators. These form a key\ningredient in the semi-classical calculation of the number of massive vacua of\nN=1* gauge theories with gauge algebra su(n) compactified on a circle. Using\narithmetic, we express that number in an SL(2,Z) duality invariant manner. We\nconfirm our tally of massive vacua of the N=1* theories by a count of\ninequivalent extrema of the exact superpotential. Furthermore, we compute a\nformula for a refined index that distinguishes massive vacua according to their\nunbroken discrete gauge group.\n", "  The conclusion of the WISE mission presents an opportune time to summarize\nthe history of using excess emission in the infrared as a tracer of\ncircumstellar material and exploit all available data for future missions such\nas JWST. We have compiled a catalog of infrared excess stars from peer-reviewed\narticles and perform an extensive search for new infrared excess stars by\ncross-correlating the Tycho-2 and AllWISE catalogs. We define a significance of\nexcess in four spectral type divisions and select stars showing greater than\neither 3$\\sigma$ or 5$\\sigma$ significance of excess in the mid- and\nfar-infrared. Through procedures including SED fitting and various image\nanalyses, each potential excess source was rigorously vetted to eliminate\nfalse-positives. The infrared excess stars from the literature and the new\nstars found through the Tycho-2 and AllWISE cross-correlation produced nearly\n500 `Prime' infrared excess stars and $\\geq$1200 `Reserved' stars. The main\ncatalog of infrared excess stars are nearby, bright, and either demonstrate\nexcess in more than one passband or have infrared spectroscopy confirming the\ninfrared excess. This study identifies stars that display a spectral energy\ndistribution suggestive of a secondary or post-protoplanetary generation of\ndust and they are ideal targets for future optical and infrared imaging\nobservations. The final catalogs of stars summarizes the past work using\ninfrared excess to detect dust disks and with the most extensive compilation of\ninfrared excess stars ($\\sim$ 1750) to date, we investigate various\nrelationships among stellar and disk parameters.\n", "  Using broadband photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope in combination\nwith Very Large Telescope narrowband Halpha observations of the nearby spiral\ngalaxy NGC 300, we explore a method for estimating the escape fractions of\nhydrogen-ionizing photons from HII regions within this galaxy. Our goal in this\nconcept study is to evaluate the spectral types of the most massive stars using\nthe broadband data and estimating their ionizing photon output with the help of\nstellar atmosphere models. A comparison with the Halpha flux that gives the\namount of ionized gas in the HII region provides a measure of the escape\nfraction of ionizing photons from that region. We performed some tests with a\nnumber of synthetic young clusters with varying parameters to assess the\nreliability of the method. However, we found that the derived stellar spectral\ntypes and consequently the expected ionizing photon luminosity of a region is\nhighly uncertain. The tests also show that on one hand we tended to\noverestimate the integrated photon output of a region for young ages and low\nnumbers of stars, and on the other hand we mostly underestimated the combined\nionizing luminosity for a large stellar number and older cluster ages. We\nconclude that the proposed method of using stellar broadband photometry to\ninfer the leakage of ionizing photons from HII regions is highly uncertain and\ndominated by the errors of the resulting stellar spectral types. Therefore this\nmethod is not suitable. Stellar spectra are needed to reliably determine the\nstellar types and escape fractions. Studies to this end have been carried out\nfor the Magellanic Clouds.\n", "  Tripartite entangled states, such as GHZ and W states, are typically\ngenerated by manipulating two pairs of polarization-entangled photons in bulk\noptics. Here we propose a scheme to generate W states that are entangled in the\nenergy degree of freedom in an integrated optical circuit. Our approach employs\nphoton pairs generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a micro- ring\nresonator. We also present a feasible procedure for demonstrating the\ngeneration of such a state, and we compare polarization-entangled and\nenergy-entangled schemes for the preparation of W states.\n", "  We show that the subset of high energy neutrino events detected by IceCube\nwhich correlate with the Galactic center (within uncertainties of their\nreconstructed arrival directions) could originate in the collisions of protons\naccelerated by the Sagittarius (Sgr) A* disk dynamo. Under very reasonable\nassumptions on source parameters we demonstrate that the supermassive black\nhole at the center of the Galaxy could launch protons and nuclei with multi PeV\nenergies. Acceleration of these particles in a period of seconds up to Lorentz\nfactors of \\sim 10^7 is possible by means of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,\nwhich wires the spinning magnetosphere of Sgr A* as a Faraday unipolar\ninductor. During the acceleration process the \\sim PeV progenitors of \\sim 50\nTeV neutrinos radiate curvature photons in the keV energy range. We show that\nIceCube neutrino astronomy with photon tagging on the Chandra X-ray Observatory\ncould provide a valuable probe for the Blandford-Znajek acceleration mechanism.\nWe also argue that EeV neutrinos, which may be produced in a similar fashion\nduring the merging of binary black holes, could become the smoking gun for\nparticle acceleration in a one-shot boost.\n", "  Scaling beyond two-node quantum networks using nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers\nin diamond is limited by the low probability of collecting zero phonon line\n(ZPL) photons from single centers. Here, we demonstrate GaP-on-diamond disk\nresonators which resonantly couple ZPL photons from single NV centers to\nsingle-mode waveguides. In these devices, the probability of a single NV center\nemitting a ZPL photon into the guided waveguide mode after optical excitation\ncan reach 9%, due to a combination of resonant enhancement of the ZPL emission\nand efficient coupling between the resonator and waveguide. We verify the\nsingle-photon nature of the emission and experimentally demonstrate both high\nin-waveguide photon numbers and substantial Purcell enhancement for a set of\ndevices. These devices may enable scalable integrated quantum networks based on\nNV centers.\n", "  Warm or massive gas giant planets, brown dwarfs, and debris disks around\nnearby stars are now routinely observed by dedicated high-contrast imaging\ninstruments on large, ground-based observatories. These facilities include\nextreme adaptive optics (ExAO) and state-of-the-art coronagraphy to achieve\nunprecedented sensitivities for exoplanet detection and spectral\ncharacterization. However, differential aberrations between the ExAO sensing\npath and the science path represent a critical limitation for the detection of\ngiant planets with a contrast lower than a few $10^{-6}$ at very small\nseparations (<0.3\\as) from their host star. In our previous work, we proposed a\nwavefront sensor based on Zernike phase contrast methods to circumvent this\nissue and measure these quasi-static aberrations at a nanometric level. We\npresent the design, manufacturing and testing of ZELDA, a prototype that was\ninstalled on VLT/SPHERE during its reintegration in Chile. Using the internal\nlight source of the instrument, we performed measurements in the presence of\nZernike or Fourier modes introduced with the deformable mirror. Our\nexperimental and simulation results are consistent, confirming the ability of\nour sensor to measure small aberrations (<50 nm rms) with nanometric accuracy.\nWe then corrected the long-lived non-common path aberrations in SPHERE based on\nZELDA measurements. We estimated a contrast gain of 10 in the coronagraphic\nimage at 0.2\\as, reaching the raw contrast limit set by the coronagraph in the\ninstrument. The simplicity of the design and its phase reconstruction algorithm\nmakes ZELDA an excellent candidate for the on-line measurements of quasi-static\naberrations during the observations. The implementation of a ZELDA-based\nsensing path on the current and future facilities (ELTs, future space missions)\ncould ease the observation of the cold gaseous or massive rocky planets around\nnearby stars.\n", "  Using a theoretical model, we track the thermal evolution of a cooling\nneutron star crust after an accretion induced heating period with the goal of\nconstraining the crustal parameters. We present for the first time a crust\ncooling model $-\\text{ } NSCool\\text{ } -$ that takes into account detailed\nvariability during the full outburst based on the observed light curve. We\napply our model to KS 1731-260. The source was in outburst for $\\sim$12 years\nduring which it was observed to undergo variations on both long (years) and\nshort (days-weeks) timescales. Our results show that KS 1731-260 does not reach\na steady state profile during the outburst due to fluctuations in the derived\naccretion rate. Additionally, long time-scale outburst variability mildly\naffects the complete crust cooling phase, while variations in the final months\nof the outburst strongly influence the first $\\sim$40 days of the calculated\ncooling curve. We discuss the consequences for estimates of the neutron star\ncrust parameters, and argue that detailed modelling of the final phase of the\noutburst is key to constraining the origin of the shallow heat source.\n", "  Despite being a major component in the teaching of special relativity, the\ntwin `paradox' is generally not examined in courses on general relativity. Due\nto the complexity of analytical solutions to the problem, the paradox is often\nneglected entirely, and students are left with an incomplete understanding of\nthe relativistic behaviour of time. This article outlines a project, undertaken\nby undergraduate physics students at the University of Sydney, in which a novel\ncomputational method was derived in order to predict the time experienced by a\ntwin following a number of paths between two given spacetime coordinates. By\nutilising this method, it is possible to make clear to students that following\na geodesic in curved spacetime does not always result in the greatest\nexperienced proper time.\n", "  We consider the Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) model in the first\norder formalism. We show that all the solutions of the Einstein gravity with\nnegative cosmological constants solve the equations of motion of considered\nmodel. Then we find an expression for the off-shell conserved charges of this\nmodel. By considering the near horizon geometry of a three dimensional black\nhole in the Gaussian null coordinates, we find near horizon conserved charges\nand their algebra. The obtained algebra is centrally extended. By writing the\nalgebra of conserved charges in terms of Fourier modes and considering the BTZ\nblack hole solution as an example, one can see that the charge associated with\nrotations along $\\mathcal{Y}_{0}$ coincides exactly with the angular momentum,\nand he charge associated with time translations $\\mathcal{T}_{0}$ is the\nproduct of the black hole entropy and its temperature. As we expect, in the\nlimit when the GMMG tends to the Einstein gravity, all the result we obtain in\nthis paper reduce to the result of the paper \\cite{5}.\n", "  Merging has been proposed to explain multiple populations in globular\nclusters (GCs) where there is a spread in iron abundance (hereafter,\niron-complex GCs). By means of N-body simulations, we investigate if merging is\nconsistent with the observations of sub-populations and rotation in\niron-complex GCs. The key parameters are the initial mass and density ratios of\nthe progenitors. When densities are similar, the more massive progenitor\ndominates the central part of the merger remnant and the less massive\nprogenitor forms an extended rotating population. The low-mass progenitor can\nbecome the majority population in the central regions of the merger remnant\nonly if its initial density is higher by roughly the mass ratio. To match the\nradial distribution of multiple populations in two iron-complex GCs ({\\omega}\nCen and NGC 1851), the less massive progenitor needs to be four times as dense\nas the larger one. Our merger remnants show solid-body rotation in the inner\nparts, becoming differential in the outer parts. Rotation velocity V and\nellipticity {\\epsilon} are in agreement with models for oblate rotators with\nisotropic dispersion. We discuss several kinematic signatures of a merger with\na denser lower mass progenitor that can be tested with future observations.\n", "  In this review article three promising aspects of top quark production are\ndiscussed: the charge asymmetry in top quark pair production, the search for\nresonant top quark pair production, and electroweak single top quark\nproduction. First, an overview of the theoretical predictions of top quark pair\nand single top quark production is given. Then, for each topic the general\nanalysis strategy and improvements are exemplarily explained using selected\nanalyses and are put into the context of the global status at the beginning of\nLHC Run II and progress in this field. The example analyses discussed in more\ndetail in this article use data from the LHC experiment CMS and for the charge\nasymmetry studies also data from the Tevatron experiment CDF have been used.\n", "  We introduce a series of articles reviewing various aspects of integrable\nmodels relevant to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Topics covered in these reviews\nare: classical integrability, Yangian symmetry, factorized scattering, the\nBethe ansatz, the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, and integrable structures in\n(conformal) quantum field theory. In the present article we highlight how these\nconcepts have found application in AdS/CFT, and provide a brief overview of the\nmaterial contained in this series.\n", "  We give a pedagogical introduction to the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, a\nmethod that allows us to describe the thermodynamics of integrable models whose\nspectrum is found via the (asymptotic) Bethe ansatz. We set the stage by\nderiving the Fermi-Dirac distribution and associated free energy of free\nelectrons, and then in a similar though technically more complicated fashion\ntreat the thermodynamics of integrable models, focusing on the one dimensional\nBose gas with delta function interaction as a clean pedagogical example,\nsecondly the XXX spin chain as an elementary (lattice) model with prototypical\ncomplicating features in the form of bound states, and finally the SU(2) chiral\nGross-Neveu model as a field theory example. Throughout this discussion we\nemphasize the central role of particle and hole densities, whose relations\ndetermine the model under consideration. We then discuss tricks that allow us\nto use the same methods to describe the exact spectra of integrable field\ntheories on a circle, in particular the chiral Gross-Neveu model. We moreover\ndiscuss the simplification of TBA equations to Y systems, including the\ntransition back to integral equations given sufficient analyticity data, in\nsimple examples.\n", "  We prove the conjecture of Sfetsos, Siampos and Thompson that suitable\nanalytic continuations of the Poisson-Lie T-duals of the bi-Yang-Baxter sigma\nmodels coincide with the recently introduced generalized lambda models. We then\ngeneralize this result by showing that the analytic continuation of a generic\nsigma model of \"universal WZW-type\" introduced by Tseytlin in 1993 is nothing\nbut the Poisson-Lie T-dual of a generic Poisson-Lie symmetric sigma model\nintroduced by Klimcik and Severa in 1995.\n", "  Investigation of dynamics in dense granular media is challenging. Here we\npresent a setup that facilitates gas fluidization of dense granular media in\nmicrogravity. The dynamics is characterized using diffusing wave spectroscopy.\nWe demonstrate that agitated granular media reach a steady state within\nfractions of a second in drop tower flights. The intensity autocorrelation\nfunctions obtained in microgravity show a remarkable dependence on sample\nvolume fraction and driving strength. A plateau in correlation merges at low\nvolume fractions and strong driving, while correlation decays only very slowly\nbut continuously at high packing fractions. The setup allows to independently\nset sample volume fraction and driving strength, and thus extends the\npossibilities for investigations on dynamics in dense granular on ground.\n", "  Loop quantum cosmology is a tentative approach to model the universe down to\nthe Planck era where quantum gravity settings are needed. The quantization of\nthe universe as a dynamical space-time is inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity\nideas. In addition, loop quantum cosmology could bridge contact with\nastronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology\nmodellings in the light of observations. To do so however, modelling both the\nbackground evolution and its perturbations is needed. The latter describe\ncosmic inhomogeneities that are the main cosmological observables. In this\ncontext, we present the so-called deformed algebra approach implementing the\nquantum corrections to the perturbed universe at an effective level by taking\ngreat care of gauge issues. We particularly highlight that in this framework,\nthe algebra of hypersurface deformation receives quantum corrections, and we\ndiscuss their meaning. The primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor\ninhomogeneities are then presented, assuming initial conditions are set in the\ncontracting phase preceding the quantum bounce and the well-known expanding\nphase of the cosmic history. These spectra are subsequently propagated to\nangular power spectra of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.\nIt is then shown that regardless of the choice for the initial conditions\ninside the effective approach for the background evolution (except that they\nare set in the contracting phase), the predicted angular power spectra of the\npolarized B-modes exceed the upper bound currently set by observations. The\nexclusion of this specific version of loop quantum cosmology establishes the\nfalsifiability of the approach, though one shall not conclude here that either\nloop quantum cosmology or loop quantum gravity is excluded.\n", "  Electrons on liquid helium can form different phases depending on density,\nand temperature. Also the electron-ripplon coupling strength influences the\nphase diagram, through the formation of so-called \"ripplonic polarons\", that\nchange how electrons are localized, and that shifts the transition between the\nWigner solid and the liquid phase. We use an all-coupling, finite-temperature\nvariational method to study the formation of a ripplopolaron Wigner solid on a\nliquid helium film for different regimes of the electron-ripplon coupling\nstrength. In addition to the three known phases of the ripplopolaron system\n(electron Wigner solid, polaron Wigner solid, and electron fluid), we define\nand identify a fourth distinct phase, the ripplopolaron liquid. We analyse the\ntransitions between these four phases and calculate the corresponding phase\ndiagrams. This reveals a reentrant melting of the electron solid as a function\nof temperature. The calculated regions of existence of the Wigner solid are in\nagreement with recent experimental data.\n", "  The 2.725 K cosmic microwave background has played a key role in the\ndevelopment of modern cosmology by providing a solid observational foundation\nfor constraining possible theories of what happened at very large redshifts and\ntheoretical speculation reaching back almost to the would-be big bang initial\nsingularity. After recounting some of the lesser known history of this area, I\nsummarize the current observational situation and also discuss some exciting\nchallenges that lie ahead: the search for B modes, the precision mapping of the\nCMB gravitational lensing potential, and the ultra-precise characterization of\nthe CMB frequency spectrum, which would allow the exploitation of spectral\ndistortions to probe new physics.\n", "  We investigate a dilaton gravity model in AdS$_2$ proposed by Almheiri and\nPolchinski and develop a 1d effective description in terms of a dynamical\nboundary time with a Schwarzian derivative action. We show that the effective\nmodel is equivalent to a 1d version of Liouville theory, and investigate its\ndynamics and symmetries via a standard canonical framework. We include the\ncoupling to arbitrary conformal matter and analyze the effective action in the\npresence of possible sources. We compute commutators of local operators at\nlarge time separation, and match the result with the time shift due to a\ngravitational shockwave interaction. We study a black hole evaporation process\nand comment on the role of entropy in this model.\n", "  This paper has the purpose to study the rate capability of the Resistive\nPlate Chamber, RPC, starting from the basic physics of this detector. The\neffect of different working parameters determining the rate capability is\nanalysed in detail, in order to optimize a new family of RPCs for applications\nto heavy irradiation environments and in particular to the LHC phase 2. A\nspecial emphasis is given to the improvement achievable by minimizing the\navalanche charge delivered in the gas. The paper shows experimental results of\nCosmic Ray tests, performed to study the avalanche features for different gas\ngap sizes, with particular attention to the overall delivered charge. For this\npurpose, the paper studies, in parallel to the prompt electronic signal, also\nthe ionic signal which gives the main contribution to the delivered charge.\nWhenever possible the test results are interpreted on the base of the RPC\ndetector physics and are intended to extend and reinforce our physical\nunderstanding of this detector.\n", "  We present the results of a spectroscopic search for narrow emission and\nabsorption features in the X-ray spectra of long gamma-ray burst (GRB)\nafterglows. Using XMM-Newton data, both EPIC and RGS spectra, of six bright\n(fluence >10^{-7} erg cm^{-2}) and relatively nearby (z=0.54-1.41) GRBs, we\nperformed a blind search for emission or absorption lines that could be related\nto a high cloud density or metal-rich gas in the environ close to the GRBs. We\ndetected five emission features in four of the six GRBs with an overall\nstatistical significance, assessed through Monte Carlo simulations, of <3.0\nsigma. Most of the lines are detected around the observed energy of the oxygen\nedge at ~0.5 keV, suggesting that they are not related to the GRB environment\nbut are most likely of Galactic origin. No significant absorption features were\ndetected. A spectral fitting with a free Galactic column density (N_H) testing\ndifferent models for the Galactic absorption confirms this origin because we\nfound an indication of an excess of Galactic N_H in these four GRBs with\nrespect to the tabulated values.\n", "  Fluctuations of conserved quantities are sensitive observables to probe the\nsignature of QCD phase transition and critical point in heavy-ion collisions.\nWith the UrQMD model, we have studied the centrality and energy dependence of\nvarious order cumulants and cumulant ratios (up to fourth order) of\nnet-proton,net-charge and net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Au+Au\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200 GeV. The\nmodel results show that the production mechanism of the particles and\nanti-particles have significant impacts on the cumulants of net-particles\nmultiplicity distributions and show strong energy dependence. We also made\ncomparisons between model calculations and experimental data measured in the\nfirst phase of the beam energy scan (BES) program by the STAR experiment at\nRHIC. The comparisons indicate that the baryon conservation effect strongly\nsuppress the cumulants of net-proton distributions at low energies and the\nnon-monotonic energy dependence for the net-proton {\\KV} at the most central\nAu+Au collisions measured by the STAR experiment can not be described by the\nUrQMD model. Since there has no physics of QCD phase transition and QCD\ncritical point implemented in the UrQMD, the model results provide us baselines\nand qualitative estimates about the non-critical background contributions to\nthe fluctuations observables in heavy-ion collisions.\n", "  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is one of the finest probes of\ncosmology. Its all-sky temperature and linear polarization (LP) fluctuations\nhave been measured precisely at a level of deltaT/TCMB ~10^{-6}. In comparison,\ncircular polarization (CP) of the CMB, however, has not been precisely\nexplored. Current upper limit on the CP of the CMB is at a level of deltaV/TCMB\n~10^{-4} and is limited on large scales. Some of the cosmologically important\nsources which can induce a CP in the CMB include early universe symmetry\nbreaking, primordial magnetic field, galaxy clusters and Pop III stars (also\nknown as the First stars). Among these sources, Pop III stars are expected to\ninduce the strongest signal with levels strongly dependent on the frequency of\nobservation and on the number, Np, of the Pop III stars per halo.\nOptimistically, a CP signal in the CMB due to the Pop III stars could be at a\nlevel of deltaV/TCMB ~ 2x10^{-7} in scales of 1 degree at 10 GHz, which is much\nsmaller than the currently existing upper limits on the CP measurements.\nPrimary foregrounds in the cosmological CP detection will come from the\ngalactic synchrotron emission (GSE), which is naturally (intrinsically)\ncircularly polarized. We use data-driven models of the galactic magnetic field\n(GMF), thermal electron density and relativistic electron density to simulate\nall-sky maps of the galactic CP in different frequencies. This work also points\nout that the galactic CP levels are important below 50 GHz and is an important\nfactor for telescopes aiming to detect primordial B-modes using CP as a\nsystematics rejection channel. Final results on detectability are summarized in\nFig (11-13).\n", "  It is generally accepted today that our solar system has undergone a phase\nduring which the orbits of the giant planets became very unstable. In recent\nyears, many studies have identified traces of this event and have provided\nreasonable justification for this occurrence. The magnitude (in terms of\norbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with\nrespect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The\nterrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet\ninstability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming,\nor the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other\nimpulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009;\nKaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable. Because a\nlarge orbital jump is a low probability event, the early instability hypothesis\nseems to be favored. However, the asteroid belt would also evolve in a\ndifferent way, assuming different instability amplitudes. These two constraints\nneed to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other.\nConsidering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al.\n(2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the\ncurrent asteroid belt. Here we confirm the same conclusion, but considering an\nasteroid population already strongly excited in eccentricity, such as that\nproduced in the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011). Because the asteroids\nexisted since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial\nplanets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid\nregardless of whether the instability happened early or late. Hence, at this\nstage, assuming an early instability does not appear to provide any advantage\nin terms of the probabilistic reconstruction of the solar system structure.\n", "  Superconformal algebra leads to remarkable connections between the masses of\nmesons and baryons of the same parity -- supersymmetric relations between the\nbosonic and fermionic bound states of QCD. Supercharges connect the mesonic\neigenstates to their baryonic superpartners, where the mesons have internal\nangular momentum one unit higher than the baryons. We also predict the\nexistence of tetraquarks which are degenerate in mass with baryons with the\nsame angular momentum. An effective supersymmetric light-front Hamiltonian for\nhadrons composed of light quarks can be constructed by embedding superconformal\nquantum mechanics into AdS space. The breaking of conformal symmetry determines\na unique quark-confining light-front potential for light hadrons including\nspin-spin interactions in agreement with the soft-wall AdS/QCD approach and\nlight-front holography. The mass-squared of the light hadrons can be expressed\nas a frame-independent decomposition of contributions from the constituent\nkinetic energy, the confinement potential, and spin-spin contributions. The\nmass of the pion eigenstate vanishes in the chiral limit. Only one mass\nparameter appears; it sets the confinement mass scale, a universal value for\nthe slope of all Regge trajectories, the nonzero mass of the proton and other\nhadrons in the chiral limit, as well as the mass parameter of the pQCD running\ncoupling. The result is an effective coupling defined at all momenta. The\nmatching of the high and low momentum-transfer regimes determines a scale $Q_0$\nwhich sets the interface between perturbative and nonperturbative hadron\ndynamics. as well as the factorization scale for structure functions and\ndistribution amplitudes. This procedure, in combination with the\nscheme-independent PMC procedure for setting renormalization scales, can\ngreatly improve the precision of QCD predictions.\n", "  The New Horizons spacecraft has found evidence for geologic activity on the\nsurface of Pluto, including extensional tectonic deformation of its water ice\nbedrock (see Moore et al., 2016). One mechanism that could drive extensional\ntectonic activity is global surface expansion due to the partial freezing of an\nocean. We use updated physical properties for Pluto and simulate its thermal\nevolution to understand the survival of a possible subsurface ocean. For\nthermal conductivities of rock less than 3 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, an ocean forms\nand at least partially freezes, leading to recent extensional stresses in the\nice shell. In scenarios where the ocean freezes and the ice shell is thicker\nthan $260$ km, ice II forms and causes global volume contraction. Since there\nis no evidence for recent compressional tectonic features, we argue that ice II\nhas not formed and that Pluto's ocean has likely survived to present day.\n", "  We apply duality rotations and complex transformations to the Schwarzschild\nmetric to obtain wormhole geometries with two asymptotically flat regions\nconnected by a throat. In the simplest case these are the well-known wormholes\nsupported by phantom scalar field. Further duality rotations remove the scalar\nfield to yield less well known vacuum metrics of the oblate Zipoy-Voorhees-Weyl\nclass, which describe ring wormholes. The ring encircles the wormhole throat\nand can have any radius, whereas its tension is always negative and should be\nless than $-c^4/4G$. If the tension reaches the maximal value, the geometry\nbecomes exactly flat, but the topology remains non-trivial and corresponds to\ntwo copies of Minkowski space glued together along the disk encircled by the\nring. The geodesics are straight lines, and those which traverse the ring get\nto the other universe. The ring therefore literally produces a hole in space.\nSuch wormholes could perhaps be created by negative energies concentrated in\ntoroidal volumes, for example by vacuum fluctuations.\n", "  We report the results obtained by a systematic, broadband (0.5--150 keV)\nX-ray spectral analysis of moderately obscured (Compton-thin; $22 \\leq \\log\nN_{\\rm H} < 24$) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with Suzaku and\nSwift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). Our sample consists of 45 local AGNs at\n$z<0.1$ with $\\log L_{\\rm 14-195\\1mmkeV} > 42$ detected in the Swift/BAT\n70-month survey, whose Suzaku archival data are available as of 2015 December.\nAll spectra are uniformly fit with a baseline model composed of an absorbed\ncutoff power-law component, reflected emission accompanied by a narrow\nfluorescent iron-K$\\alpha$ line from cold matter (torus), and scattered\nemission. Main results based on the above analysis are as follows. (1) The\nphoton index is correlated with Eddington ratio, but not with luminosity or\nblack hole mass. (2) The ratio of the iron-K$\\alpha$ line to X-ray luminosity,\na torus covering fraction indicator, shows significant anti-correlation with\nluminosity. (3) The averaged reflection strength derived from stacked spectra\nabove 14 keV is larger in less luminous ($\\log L_{\\rm 10-50\\1mmkeV} \\leq 43.3$;\n$R= 1.04^{+0.17}_{-0.19}$) or highly obscured AGNs ($\\log N_{\\rm H} > 23$; $R =\n1.03^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$) than in more luminous ($\\log L_{\\rm 10-50\\1mmkeV} >\n43.3$; $R= 0.46^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$) or lightly obscured objects ($\\log N_{\\rm H}\n\\leq 23$; $R = 0.59^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$), respectively. (4) The [O IV] 25.89\n$\\mu$m line to X-ray luminosity ratio is significantly smaller in AGNs with\nlower soft X-ray scattering fractions, suggesting that the [O IV] 25.89 $\\mu$m\nluminosity underestimates the intrinsic power of an AGN buried in a small\nopening-angle torus.\n", "  Using optimal detection techniques with climate model simulations, most of\nthe observed increase of near surface temperatures over the second half of the\ntwentieth century is attributed to anthropogenic influences. However, the\npartitioning of the anthropogenic influence to individual factors, such as\ngreenhouse gases and aerosols, is much less robust. Differences in how forcing\nfactors are applied, in their radiative influence and in models' climate\nsensitivities, substantially influence the response patterns. We find standard\noptimal detection methodologies cannot fully reconcile this response diversity.\nBy selecting a set of experiments to enable the diagnosing of greenhouse gases\nand the combined influence of other anthropogenic and natural factors, we find\nrobust detections of well mixed greenhouse gases across a large ensemble of\nmodels. Of the observed warming over the 20th century of 0.65K/century we find,\nusing a multi model mean not incorporating pattern uncertainty, a well mixed\ngreenhouse gas warming of 0.87 to 1.22K/century. This is partially offset by\ncooling from other anthropogenic and natural influences of -0.54 to\n-0.22K/century. Although better constrained than recent studies, the\nattributable trends across climate models are still wide, with implications for\nobservational constrained estimates of transient climate response. Some of the\nuncertainties could be reduced in future by having more model data to better\nquantify the simulated estimates of the signals and natural variability, by\ndesigning model experiments more effectively and better quantification of the\nclimate model radiative influences. Most importantly, how model pattern\nuncertainties are incorporated into the optimal detection methodology should be\nimproved.\n", "  Recent observations of AGN activity in massive galaxies (log Mstar / Msun >\n10.4) show that: 1) at z < 1, AGN-hosting galaxies do not show enhanced merger\nsignatures compared to normal galaxies, 2) also at z < 1, most AGNs are hosted\nby quiescent galaxies; and 3) at z > 1, percentage of AGNs in star forming\ngalaxies increases and becomes comparable to AGN percentage in quiescent\ngalaxies at z ~ 2. How can major mergers explain AGN activity in massive\nquiescent galaxies which have no merger features and no star formation to\nindicate recent galaxy merger? By matching merger events in a cosmological\nN-body simulation to the observed AGN incidence probability in the COSMOS\nsurvey, we show that major merger triggered AGN activity is consistent with the\nobservations. By distinguishing between \"peak\" AGNs (recently merger triggered\nand hosted by star forming galaxies) and \"faded\" AGNs (merger triggered a long\ntime ago and now residing in quiescent galaxies), we show that the AGN\noccupation fraction in star forming and quiescent galaxies simply follows the\nevolution of the galaxy merger rate. Since the galaxy merger rate drops\ndramatically at z < 1, the only AGNs left to be observed are the ones triggered\nby old mergers and are now in the declining phase of their nuclear activity,\nhosted by quiescent galaxies. As we go toward higher redshifts the galaxy\nmerger rate increases and the percentages of \"peak\" AGNs and \"faded\" AGNs\nbecome comparable.\n", "  Hyperuniformity characterizes a state of matter that is poised at a critical\npoint at which density or volume-fraction fluctuations are anomalously\nsuppressed at infinite wavelengths. Recently, much attention has been given to\nthe link between strict jamming and hyperuniformity in frictionless\nhard-particle packings. Doing so requires one to study very large packings,\nwhich can be difficult to jam properly. We modify the rigorous linear\nprogramming method of Donev et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 197, 139 (2004)] in order to\ntest for jamming in putatively jammed packings of hard-disks in two dimensions.\nWe find that various standard packing protocols struggle to reliably create\npackings that are jammed for even modest system sizes; importantly, these\npackings appear to be jammed by conventional tests. We present evidence that\nsuggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random\njammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating\nexactly-jammed configurations due to a type of \"critical slowing down\" as the\nnecessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols.\nAdditionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting\nhyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are\nbetter able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one\nshould not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with\nrattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly\nhyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability\nto ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are\nindeed linked. This raises the possibility that the ideal MRJ packings have no\nrattlers. Our work provides the impetus for the development of packing\nalgorithms that produce large disordered strictly jammed packings that are\nrattler-free.\n", "  Recent observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)\nhave discovered a new class of numerous low-lying dynamic loop structures, and\nit has been argued that they are the long-postulated unresolved fine structures\n(UFS) that dominate the emission of the solar transition region. In this\nletter, we combine IRIS measurements of the properties of a sample of 108 UFS\n(intensities, lengths, widths, lifetimes) with 1-D non-equilibrium ionization\nsimulations using the HYDRAD hydrodynamic model to examine whether the UFS are\nnow truly spatially resolved in the sense of being individual structures rather\nthan composed of multiple magnetic threads. We find that a simulation of an\nimpulsively heated single strand can reproduce most of the observed properties\nsuggesting that the UFS may be resolved, and the distribution of UFS widths\nimplies that they are structured on a spatial scale of 133km on average.\nSpatial scales of a few hundred km appear to be typical for a range of\nchromospheric and coronal structures, and we conjecture that this could be an\nimportant clue to the coronal heating process.\n", "  The GlueX experiment was designed to search for and study the pattern of\ngluonic excitations in the meson spectrum produced through photoproduction\nreactions at a new tagged photon beam facility in Hall D at Jefferson\nLaboratory. The particle identification capabilities of the GlueX experiment\nwill be enhanced by constructing a DIRC (Detection of Internally Reflected\nCherenkov light) detector, utilizing components of the decommissioned BaBar\nDIRC. The DIRC will allow systematic studies of kaon final states that are\nessential for inferring the quark flavor content of both hybrid and\nconventional mesons. The design for the GlueX DIRC is presented, including the\nnew expansion volumes that are currently under development.\n", "  We present the results of a wide-field imaging survey of the periphery of the\nMilky Way globular cluster NGC 7089 (M2). Data were obtained with MegaCam on\nthe Magellan Clay Telescope, and the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco\nTelescope. We find that M2 is embedded in a diffuse stellar envelope extending\nto a radial distance of at least $\\sim 60^{\\prime}$ ($\\sim 210$ pc) -- five\ntimes the nominal tidal radius of the cluster. The envelope appears nearly\ncircular in shape, has a radial density decline well described by a power law\nof index $\\gamma = -2.2 \\pm 0.2$, and contains approximately $1.6\\%$ of the\nluminosity of the entire system. While the origin of the envelope cannot be\nrobustly identified using the presently available data, the fact that M2 also\nhosts stellar populations exhibiting a broad dispersion in the abundances of\nboth iron and a variety of neutron capture elements suggests that this object\nmight plausibly constitute the stripped nucleus of a dwarf Galaxy that was long\nago accreted and destroyed by the Milky Way.\n", "  We use archival data from the Phoenix Deep Survey to investigate the variable\nradio source population above 1mJy/beam at 1.4GHz. Given the similarity of this\nsurvey to other such surveys we take the opportunity to investigate the\nconflicting results which have appeared in the literature. Two previous surveys\nfor variability conducted with the Very Large Array (VLA) achieved a\nsensitivity of 1mJy/beam. However, one survey found an areal density of radio\nvariables on timescales of decades that is a factor of ~4 times greater than a\nsecond survey which was conducted on timescales of less than a few years. In\nthe Phoenix deep field we measure the density of variable radio sources to be\n$\\rho =0.98\\mathrm{deg}^{-2}$ on timescales of 6 months to 8 years. We make use\nof WISE infrared cross-ids, and identify all variable sources as an AGN of some\ndescription. We suggest that the discrepancy between previous VLA results is\ndue to the different time scales probed by each of the surveys, and that radio\nvariability at 1.4 GHz is greatest on timescales of 2 - 5 years.\n", "  In this study we consider an idealization of a typical optical tweezers\nexperiment involving a semiflexible double-knotted polymer, with steric\nhindrance and persistence length matching those of dsDNA in high salt\nconcentration, under strong stretching. Using exhaustive Molecular Dynamics\nsimulations we show that not only does a double-knotted dsDNA filament under\ntension possess a free energy minimum when the two knots are intertwined, but\nalso that the depth of this minimum depends on the relative chirality of the\ntwo knots. We rationalize this dependence of the effective interaction on the\nchirality in terms of a competition between chain entropy and bending energy.\n", "  We present the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST), a probabilistic\napproach to modeling the dust extinguished photometric spectral energy\ndistribution of an individual star while accounting for observational\nuncertainties common to large resolved star surveys. Given a set of photometric\nmeasurements and an observational uncertainty model, the BEAST infers the\nphysical properties of the stellar source using stellar evolution and\natmosphere models and constrains the line of sight extinction using a newly\ndeveloped mixture model that encompasses the full range of dust extinction\ncurves seen in the Local Group. The BEAST is specifically formulated for use\nwith large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar populations. Our approach\naccounts for measurement uncertainties and any covariance between them due to\nstellar crowding (both systematic biases and uncertainties in the bias) and\nabsolute flux calibration, thereby incorporating the full information content\nof the measurement. We illustrate the accuracy and precision possible with the\nBEAST using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. While the\nBEAST has been developed for this survey, it can be easily applied to similar\nexisting and planned resolved star surveys.\n", "  We present a study of a large filamentary structure at z~0.73 in the field of\nthe COSMOS survey, the so-called COSMOS Wall. This structure encompasses a\ncomprehensive range of environments from a dense cluster and a number of galaxy\ngroups to filaments, less dense regions, and adjacent voids. It thus provides a\nvaluable laboratory for the accurate mapping of environmental effects on galaxy\nevolution at a look-back time of ~6.5 Gyr, when the Universe was roughly half\nits present age.\n  We performed deep spectroscopic observations with VIMOS at VLT of a K-band\nselected sample of galaxies in this complex structure, building a sample of\ngalaxies complete in galaxy stellar mass down to a lower limit of log(M/M_sun)~\n9.8, which is significantly deeper than previously available data. Thanks to\nits location within the COSMOS survey, each galaxy benefits from a wealth of\nancillary information.\n  In this paper we detail the survey strategy and weighting scheme adopted to\naccount for the biases introduced by the photometric pre-selection of our\ntargets. We present our galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame magnitudes estimates\ntogether with a group catalog obtained with our new data and their member\ngalaxies color/mass distribution.\n  Owing to to our new sample we can perform a detailed, high definition mapping\nof the complex COSMOS Wall structure. The sharp environmental information,\ncoupled with high quality spectroscopic information and rich ancillary data\navailable in the COSMOS field, enables a detailed study of galaxy properties as\na function of local environment in a redshift slice where environmental effects\nare important, and in a stellar mass range where mass and environment driven\neffects are both at work.\n", "  We present a comparative multi-wavelength analysis of water maser-emitting\nregions and non-maser-emitting luminous 24 micron star-forming regions in the\nAndromeda Galaxy (M31) to identify the sites most likely to produce luminous\nwater masers useful for astrometry and proper motion studies. Included in the\nanalysis are Spitzer 24 micron photometry, Herschel 70 and 160 micron\nphotometry, H$\\alpha$ emission, dust temperature, and star formation rate. We\nfind significant differences between the maser-emitting and non-maser-emitting\nregions: water maser-emitting regions tend to be more IR-luminous and show\nhigher star formation rates. The five water masers in M31 are consistent with\nbeing analogs of water masers in Galactic star-forming regions and represent\nthe high-luminosity tail of a larger (and as yet undetected) population. Most\nregions likely to produce water masers bright enough for proper motion\nmeasurements using current facilities have already been surveyed, but we\nsuggest three ways to detect additional water masers in M31: (1) Re-observe the\nmost luminous mid- or far-IR sources with higher sensitivity than was used in\nthe Green Bank Telescope survey; (2) Observe early-stage star-forming regions\nselected by mm continuum that have not already been selected by their 24 micron\nemission, and (3) Re-observe the most luminous mid- or far-IR sources, and rely\non maser variability for new detections.\n", "  We present an analytical calculation of the hydrodynamic interaction between\ntwo spherical particles near an elastic interface such as a cell membrane. The\ntheory predicts the frequency dependent self- and pair-mobilities accounting\nfor the finite particle size up to the 5th order in the ratio between particle\ndiameter and wall distance as well as between diameter and interparticle\ndistance. We find that particle motion towards a membrane with pure bending\nresistance always leads to mutual repulsion similar as in the well-known case\nof a hard-wall. In the vicinity of a membrane with shearing resistance,\nhowever, we observe an attractive interaction in a certain parameter range\nwhich is in contrast to the behavior near a hard wall. This attraction might\nfacilitate surface chemical reactions. Furthermore, we show that there exists a\nfrequency range in which the pair-mobility for perpendicular motion exceeds its\nbulk value, leading to short-lived superdiffusive behavior. Using the\nanalytical particle mobilities we compute collective and relative diffusion\ncoefficients. The appropriateness of the approximations in our analytical\nresults is demonstrated by corresponding boundary integral simulations which\nare in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n", "  A detailed analytical model has been developed to simulate isotope-release\ncurves from thin-foils ISOL targets. It involves the separate modelling of\ndiffusion and effusion inside the target. The former has been modelled using\nboth first and second Fick's law. The latter, effusion from the surface of the\ntarget material to the end of the ionizer, was simulated with the Monte Carlo\ncode MolFlow+. The calculated delay-time distribution for this process was then\nfitted using a double-exponential function. The release curve obtained from the\nconvolution of diffusion and effusion shows good agreement with experimental\ndata from two different target geometries used at ISOLDE. Moreover, the\nexperimental yields are well reproduced when combining the release fraction\nwith calculated in-target production.\n", "  Since the earliest implementations of the various GW approximations and\ncumulant expansion in the calculations of quasiparticle propagators and\nspectra, several attempts have been made to combine the advantageous properties\nand results of these two theoretical approaches. While the GW plus cumulant\napproach has proven successful in interpreting photoemission spectroscopy data\nin solids, the formal connection between the two methods has not been\ninvestigated in detail. By introducing a general bijective integral\nrepresentation of the cumulants, we can rigorously identify at which point\nthese two approximations can be connected for the paradigmatic model of\nquasiparticle interaction with the dielectric response of the system that has\nbeen extensively exploited in recent interpretations of the satellite\nstructures in photoelectron spectra. We establish a protocol for consistent\npractical implementation of the thus established GW+cumulant scheme, and\nillustrate it by comprehensive state-of-the-art first-principles calculations\nof intrinsic angle-resolved photoemission spectra from Si valence bands.\n", "  The accurate determination of the preferred ${\\rm Si}_{12}{\\rm C}_{12}$\nisomer is important to guide experimental efforts directed towards synthesizing\nSiC nano-wires and related polymer structures which are anticipated to be\nhighly efficient exciton materials for opto-electronic devices. In order to\ndefinitively identify preferred isomeric structures for silicon carbon\nnano-clusters, highly accurate geometries, energies and harmonic zero point\nenergies have been computed using coupled-cluster theory with systematic\nextrapolation to the complete basis limit for set of silicon carbon clusters\nranging in size from SiC$_3$ to ${\\rm Si}_{12}{\\rm C}_{12}$. It is found that\npost-MBPT(2) correlation energy plays a significant role in obtaining converged\nrelative isomer energies, suggesting that predictions using low rung density\nfunctional methods will not have adequate accuracy. Utilizing the best\ncomposite coupled-cluster energy that is still computationally feasible,\nentailing a 3-4 SCF and CCSD extrapolation with triple-$\\zeta$ (T) correlation,\nthe {\\it closo} ${\\rm Si}_{12}{\\rm C}_{12}$ isomer is identified to be the\npreferred isomer in support of previous calculations [J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 142,\n034303]. Additionally we have investigated more pragmatic approaches to\nobtaining accurate silicon carbide isomer energies, including the use of frozen\nnatural orbital coupled-cluster theory and several rungs of standard and\ndouble-hybrid density functional theory. Frozen natural orbitals as a way to\ncompute post MBPT(2) correlation energy is found to be an excellent balance\nbetween efficiency and accuracy.\n", "  The design of an atomic force microscope with an all-fiber interferometric\ndetection scheme capable of atomic resolution at about 500 mK is presented. The\nmicroscope body is connected to a small pumped 3He reservoir with a base\ntemperature of about 300 mK. The bakeable insert with the cooling stage can be\nmoved from its measurement position inside the bore of a superconducting 10 T\nmagnet into an ultra-high vacuum chamber, where tip and sample can be exchanged\nin-situ. Moreover, single atoms or molecules can be evaporated onto a cold\nsubstrate located inside the microscope. Two side chambers are equipped with\nstandard surface preparation and surface analysis tools. The performance of the\nmicroscope at low temperatures is demonstrated by resolving single Co atoms on\nMn/W(110) and by showing atomic resolution on NaCl(001).\n", "  In the context of the ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM) project, we\ncarried out an unbiased spectral survey in the millimeter window towards the\nwell known low-mass Class I source SVS13-A. The high sensitivity reached (3-12\nmK) allowed us to detect at least 6 HDO broad (FWHM ~ 4-5 km/s) emission lines\nwith upper level energies up to Eu = 837 K. A non-LTE LVG analysis implies the\npresence of very hot (150-260 K) and dense (> 3 10^7 cm-3) gas inside a small\nradius ($\\sim$ 25 AU) around the star, supporting, for the first time, the\noccurrence of a hot corino around a Class I protostar.\n  The temperature is higher than expected for water molecules are sublimated\nfrom the icy dust mantles (~ 100 K). Although we cannot exclude we are observig\nthe effects of shocks and/or winds at such small scales, this could imply that\nthe observed HDO emission is tracing the water abundance jump expected at\ntemperatures ~ 220-250 K, when the activation barrier of the gas phase\nreactions leading to the formation of water can be overcome. We derive X(HDO) ~\n3 10-6, and a H2O deuteration > 1.5 10-2, suggesting that water deuteration\ndoes not decrease as the protostar evolves from the Class 0 to the Class I\nstage.\n", "  An emerging branch of electronics, the optospintronics, would be highly\nboosted if the control of magnetic order by light is implemented in magnetic\nsemiconductors nanostructures being compatible with the actual technology. Here\nwe show that the ferromagnetic magnetization of low Fe-doped ZnO nanowires\nprepared by carbothermal process is enhanced under illumination up to\ntemperatures slightly below room temperature. This enhancement is related to\nthe existence of an oxygen vacancy V$_{\\rm O}$ in the neighbouring of an\nantiferromagnetic superexchange Fe$^{3+}$-Fe$^{3+}$ pair. Under illumination\nthe V$_{\\rm O}$ is ionized to V$_{\\rm O}^+$ giving an electron to a close\nFe$^{3+}$ ion from the antiferromagnetic pair. This light excited electron\ntransition allows the transition of Fe$^{3+}$ to Fe$^{2+}$ forming stable\nferromagnetic double exchange pairs, increasing the total magnetization. The\nresults here presented indicate an efficient way to influence the magnetic\nproperties of ZnO based nanostructures by light illumination at high\ntemperatures.\n", "  We investigate single cesium (Cs) atom heating owing to the momentum\naccumulation process induced by the resonant pulsed excitation in a microscopic\noptical dipole trap formed by a strongly focused 1064 nm laser beam. The\nheating depends on the trap frequency which restricts the maximum repetition\nrate of pulsed excitation. We experimentally verify the heating of a single\natom and then demonstrate how to suppress it with an optimized pulsed\nexcitation/cooling method. The typical trap lifetime of single Cs atom is\nextended from 108 +/- 6 us to 2536 +/- 31 ms, and the corresponding number of\nexcitation increases from ~ 108 to ~ 360000. In applying this faster cooling\nmethod, we use the trapped single Cs atom as a triggered single-photon source\nat an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz. The second-order intensity\ncorrelations of the emitted single photons are characterized by implementing\nHanbury Brown and Twiss setup, and clear anti-bunching effect has been\nobserved.\n", "  We derive the gravitational waveform from the collapse of a rapidly rotating\nsupermassive star (SMS) core leading directly to a seed of a supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) in axisymmetric numerical-relativity simulations. We find that the\npeak strain amplitude of gravitational waves emitted during the black-hole\nformation is $\\approx 5 \\times 10^{-21}$ at the frequency $f \\approx 5$\\,mHz\nfor an event at the cosmological redshift $z=3$, if the collapsing SMS core is\nin the hydrogen-burning phase. Such gravitational waves will be detectable by\nspace laser interferometric detectors like eLISA with signal-to-noise ratio\n$\\approx 10$, if the sensitivity is as high as LISA for $f=1$--10\\,mHz. The\ndetection of the gravitational-wave signal will provide a potential opportunity\nfor testing the direct-collapse scenario for the formation of a seed of SMBHs.\n", "  In this work we construct several black hole metrics which are consistent\nwith the generalized uncertainty principle logarithmic correction to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. After preserving the event horizon at the\nusual position, a singularity at the Planck scale is found. Finally, these\ngeometries are shown to be realized by certain model of nonlinear\nelectrodynamics, which resembles previously studied regular black hole\nsolutions.\n", "  We investigate black hole production in pp collisions at the Large Hadron\nCollider by employing the horizon quantum mechanics for models of gravity with\nextra spatial dimensions. This approach can be applied to processes around the\nfundamental gravitational scale and naturally yields a suppression below the\nfundamental gravitational scale and for increasing number of extra dimensions.\nThe results of numerical simulations performed with the black hole event\ngenerator BLACKMAX are here reported in order to illustrate the main\ndifferences in the number of expected black hole events and mass distributions.\n", "  Background: In the last year we have been exploring the effect of the\nexplicit inclusion of nonlocality in (d,p) reactions. Purpose: The goal of this\nwork is to extend previous studies to (d,n) reactions, which, although similar\nto (d,p), have specific properties that merit inspection. Method: We apply our\nmethods (both the distorted wave Born approximation and the adiabatic wave\napproximation) to $(d,n)$ reactions on $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca, $^{48}$Ca,\n$^{126}$Sn, $^{132}$Sn, and $^{208}$Pb at $20$ and $50$ MeV. Results: We look\nseparately at the modifications introduced by nonlocality in the final bound\nand scattering states, as well as the consequences reflected on the\ndifferential angular distributions. The cross sections obtained when using\nnonlocality explicitly are significantly different than those using the local\napproximation, just as in (d,p). Due to the particular role of Coulomb in the\nbound state, often we found the effects of nonlocality to be larger in (d,n)\nthan in (d,p). Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of including\nnonlocality explicitly in deuteron induced reactions.\n", "  Symbiotic stars often contain white dwarfs with quasi-steady shell burning on\ntheir surfaces. However, in most symbiotics, the origin of this burning is\nunclear. In symbiotic slow novae, however, it is linked to a past thermonuclear\nrunaway. In June 2015, the symbiotic slow nova AG Peg was seen in only its\nsecond optical outburst since 1850. This recent outburst was of much shorter\nduration and lower amplitude than the earlier eruption, and it contained\nmultiple peaks -- like outbursts in classical symbiotic stars such as Z And. We\nreport Swift X-ray and UV observations of AG Peg made between June 2015 and\nJanuary 2016. The X-ray flux was markedly variable on a time scale of days,\nparticularly during four days near optical maximum, when the X-rays became\nbright and soft. This strong X-ray variability continued for another month,\nafter which the X-rays hardened as the optical flux declined. The UV flux was\nhigh throughout the outburst, consistent with quasi-steady shell burning on the\nwhite dwarf. Given that accretion disks around white dwarfs with shell burning\ndo not generally produce detectable X-rays (due to Compton-cooling of the\nboundary layer), the X-rays probably originated via shocks in the ejecta. As\nthe X-ray photo-electric absorption did not vary significantly, the X-ray\nvariability may directly link to the properties of the shocked material. AG\nPeg's transition from a slow symbiotic nova (which drove the 1850 outburst) to\na classical symbiotic star suggests that shell burning in at least some\nsymbiotic stars is residual burning from prior novae.\n", "  A significant fraction of massive main-sequence stars show strong,\nlarge-scale magnetic fields. The origin of these fields, their lifetimes, and\ntheir role in shaping the characteristics and evolution of massive stars are\ncurrently not well understood. We compile a catalogue of 389 massive\nmain-sequence stars, 61 of which are magnetic, and derive their fundamental\nparameters and ages. The two samples contain stars brighter than magnitude 9 in\nthe V band and range in mass between 5 and 100 Msun. We find that the\nfractional main-sequence age distribution of all considered stars follows what\nis expected for a magnitude limited sample, while that of magnetic stars shows\na clear decrease towards the end of the main sequence. This dearth of old\nmagnetic stars is independent of the choice of adopted stellar evolution\ntracks, and appears to become more prominent when considering only the most\nmassive stars. We show that the decreasing trend in the distribution is\nsignificantly stronger than expected from magnetic flux conservation. We also\nfind that binary rejuvenation and magnetic suppression of core convection are\nunlikely to be responsible for the observed lack of older magnetic massive\nstars, and conclude that its most probable cause is the decay of the magnetic\nfield, over a time span longer than the stellar lifetime for the lowest\nconsidered masses, and shorter for the highest masses. We then investigate the\nspin-down ages of the slowly rotating magnetic massive stars and find them to\nexceed the stellar ages by far in many cases. The high fraction of very slowly\nrotating magnetic stars thus provides an independent argument for a decay of\nthe magnetic fields.\n", "  We show that in generic one-dimensional Hamiltonian lattices the diffusion\ncoefficient of the maximum Lyapunov exponent diverges in the thermodynamic\nlimit. We trace this back to the long-range correlations associated with the\nevolution of the hydrodynamic modes. In the case of normal heat transport, the\ndivergence is even stronger, leading to the breakdown of the usual\nsingle-function Family-Vicsek scaling ansatz. A similar scenario is expected to\narise in the evolution of rough interfaces in the presence of a suitably\ncorrelated background noise.\n", "  The presence or lack of eclipses in the X-ray lightcurves of ultraluminous\nX-ray sources (ULXs) can be directly linked to the accreting system geometry.\nIn the case where the compact object is stellar mass and radiates\nisotropically, we should expect eclipses by a main-sequence to sub-giant\nsecondary star on the recurrence timescale of hours to days. X-ray lightcurves\nare now available for large numbers of ULXs as a result of the latest\nXMM-Newton catalogue. We determine the amount of fractional variability that\nshould be injected into an otherwise featureless lightcurve for a given set of\nsystem parameters as a result of eclipses and compare this to the available\ndata. We find that the vast majority of sources for which the variability has\nbeen measured to be non-zero and for which available observations meet the\ncriteria for eclipse searches, have fractional variabilities which are too low\nto derive from eclipses and so must be viewed such that theta =< acos(R*/a).\nThis would require that the disc subtends a larger angle than that of the\nsecondary star and is therefore consistent with a conical outflow formed from\nsuper-critical accretion rates and implies some level of geometrical beaming in\nULXs.\n", "  A central feature of the most elementary rotating black hole (BH) solution in\nGeneral Relativity is the Kerr bound, which, for vacuum Kerr BHs, can be\nexpressed either in terms of the ADM or the horizon \"charges\". This bound,\nhowever, is not a fundamental properties of General Relativity and stationary,\nasymptotically flat, regular (on and outside an event horizon) BHs are known to\nviolate the Kerr bound, both in terms of their ADM and horizon quantities.\nExamples include the recently discovered Kerr BHs with scalar or Proca hair.\nHere, we point the fact that the Kerr bound in terms of horizon quantities is\nalso violated by well-known rotating and charged solutions, known in closed\nform, such as the Kerr-Newman and Kerr-Sen BHs. For the former, moreover, we\nobserve that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) bound is also violated in terms of\nhorizon quantities, even in the static (i.e RN) limit. For the latter, by\ncontrast, the existence of charged matter outside the horizon, allows a curious\ninvariance of the charge to mass ratio, between ADM and horizon quantities.\nRegardless of the Kerr bound violation, we show that in all case, the event\nhorizon linear velocity never exceeds the speed of light. Finally, we suggest a\nnew type of informative parameterization for BH spacetimes where part of the\nasymptotic charges is supported outside the horizon.\n", "  The resistive switching (RS) properties as a function of temperature were\nstudied for Ag/La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$CoO$_3$ (LSCO) interfaces. The LSCO is a\nfully-relaxed 100 nm film grown by metal organic deposition on a LaAlO$_3$\nsubstrate. Both low and a high resistance states were set at room temperature\nand the temperature dependence of their current-voltage (IV) characteristics\nwas mea- sured taking care to avoid a significant change of the resistance\nstate. The obtained non-trivial IV curves of each state were well reproduced by\na circuit model which includes a Poole-Frenkel element and two ohmic\nresistances. A microscopic description of the changes produced by the RS is\ngiven, which enables to envision a picture of the interface as an area where\nconductive and insulating phases are mixed, producing Maxwell-Wagner\ncontributions to the dielectric properties.\n", "  We report $^{63}$Cu- and $^{205}$Tl-NMR studies on six-layered ($n$=6)\nhigh-$T_c$ superconducting (SC) cuprate TlBa$_2$Ca$_5$Cu$_6$O$_{14+\\delta}$\n(Tl1256) with $T_c\\sim$100 K, which reveal that antiferromagnetic (AFM) order\ntakes place below $T_{\\rm N}\\sim$170 K. In this compound, four underdoped inner\nCuO$_2$ planes ($n$(IP)=4) sandwiched by two outer planes (OPs) are responsible\nfor the onset of AFM order, whereas the nearly optimally-doped OPs responsible\nfor the onset of bulk SC. It is pointed out that an increase in the\nout-of-plane magnetic interaction within an intra-unit-cell causes $T_{\\rm\nN}\\sim$ 45 K for Tl1245 with $n$(IP)=3 to increase to $\\sim$170 K for Tl1256\nwith $n$(IP)=4. It is remarkable that the marked increase in $T_{\\rm N}$ and\nthe AFM moments for the IPs does not bring about any reduction in $T_c$, since\n$T_c\\sim 100$ K is maintained for both compounds with nearly optimally doped\nOP. We highlight the fact that the SC order for $n\\ge5$ is mostly dominated by\nthe long-range in-plane SC correlation even in the multilayered structure,\nwhich is insensitive to the magnitude of $T_{\\rm N}$ and the AFM moments at the\nIPs or the AFM interaction among the IPs. These results demonstrate a novel\ninterplay between the SC and AFM orders when the charge imbalance between the\nIPs and OP is significantly large.\n", "  We show that the robust spin squeezing preservation can be achieved by\nutilizing detuning modification for an ensemble of N separate two-level atoms\nembedded in photonic crystal cavities (PCC). In particular, we explore the\ndifferent dynamical behaviors of spin squeezing between isotropic and\nanisotropic PCC cases when the atomic frequency is inside the band gap. In both\ncases, it is shown that the robust preservation of spin squeezing is completely\ndetermined by the formation of bound states. Intriguingly, we find that unlike\nthe isotropic case where steady-state spin squeezing varies smoothly when the\natomic frequency moves from the inside to the outside band edge, a sudden\ntransition occurs for the anisotropic case. The present results may be of\ndirect importance for, e.g., quantum metrology in open quantum systems.\n", "  Higgs boson mass measurement at $\\sim 125$ GeV points to a high scale for\nSUSY specifically the scalar masses. If all the scalars are heavy,\nsupersymmetric contribution to the leptonic $g-2$ moments will be significantly\nreduced. On the other hand the Brookhaven experiment indicates a 3sigma\ndeviation from the standard model prediction. Here we analyze the leptonic\n$g-2$ moments in an extended MSSM model with inclusion of a vector like\nleptonic generation which brings in new sources of CP violation. In this work\nwe consider the contributions to the leptonic $g-2$ moments arising from the\nexchange of charginos and neutralinos, sleptons and mirror sleptons, and from\nthe exchange of $W$ and $Z$ bosons and of leptons and mirror leptons. We focus\nspecifically on the $g-2$ moments for the muon and the electron where sensitive\nmeasurements exist. Here it is shown that one can get consistency with the\ncurrent data on $g-2$ under the Higgs boson mass constraint. Dependence of the\nmoments on CP phases from the extended sector are analyzed and it is shown that\nthey are sensitively dependent on the phases from the new sector. It is shown\nthat the corrections to the leptonic moments arising from the extended MSSM\nsector will be non-vanishing even if the SUSY scale extends into the PeV\nregion.\n", "  Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is widely considered to be the\nmain driver in regulating the growth of massive galaxies through heating or\ndriving gas out of the galaxy, preventing further increase in stellar mass.\nObservational proof for this scenario has, however, been scarce. We have\nassembled a sample of 132 radio-quiet type-2 and red AGN at 0.1<z<1. We measure\nthe kinematics of the AGN-ionized gas, the host galaxies' stellar masses and\nstar formation rates and investigate the relationships between AGN\nluminosities, specific star formation rates (sSFR) and outflow strengths W90 --\nthe 90\\% velocity width of the [OIII]5007 line power and a proxy for the\nAGN-driven outflow speed. Outflow strength is independent of sSFR for AGN\nselected on their mid-IR luminosity, in agreement with previous work\ndemonstrating that star formation is not sufficient to produce the observed\nionized gas outflows which have to be powered by AGN activity. More\nimportantly, we find a negative correlation between W90 and sSFR in the AGN\nhosts with the highest SFRs, i.e., with the highest gas content, where\npresumably the coupling of the AGN-driven wind to the gas is strongest. This\nimplies that AGN with strong outflow signatures are hosted in galaxies that are\nmore `quenched' than galaxies with weaker outflow signatures. Despite the\ngalaxies' high SFRs, we demonstrate that the outflows are not star-formation\ndriven but indeed due to AGN-powering. This observation is consistent with the\nAGN having a net suppression, `negative' impact, through feedback on the\ngalaxies' star formation history.\n", "  We present a model of cometary dust capable of simulating the dynamics within\nthe first few tens of km of the comet surface. Recent measurements by the GIADA\nand COSIMA instruments on Rosetta show that the nucleus emits fluffy dust\nparticles with porosities above 50% and sizes up to at least mm (Schulz et al.\n2015, Rotundi et al. 2015, Fulle et al. 2015). Retrieval of the physical\nproperties of these particles requires a model of the effective forces\ngoverning their dynamics. Here, we present a model capable of simulating\nrealistic, large and porous particles using hierarchical aggregates, which\nshows previous extrapolations to be inadequate. The main strengths of our\napproach are that we can simulate very large (mm-scale) non-spherical\nagglomerates and can accurately determine their 1) effective cross-section and\nratio of cross-section to mass, 2) gas drag coefficient, and 3) light\nscattering properties. In practical terms, we find that a more detailed\ntreatment of the dust structure results in 3-5 times higher velocities for\nlarge dust particles in the inner coma than previously estimated using\nspherical particles of the same mass. We apply our model to the dynamics of\ndust in the vicinity of the nucleus of comet 67P and successfully reproduce the\ndust speeds reported early on when the comet was roughly 3.5 AU from the Sun.\nAt this stage, we employ a simple spherical comet nucleus, we model activity as\nconstant velocity gas expansion from a uniformly active surface, and use Mie\nscattering. We discuss pathways to improve on these simplifications in the\nfuture.\n", "  Magnetic fields permeate the Universe on all scales and play a key role\nduring star formation. We study the evolution of magnetic fields around a\nmassive metal-free (Population III) star at $z \\sim 15$ during the growth of\nits HII region and subsequent supernova explosion by conducting three\ncosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations with radiation transport. Given\nthe theoretical uncertainty and weak observational constraints of magnetic\nfields in the early universe, we initialize the simulations with identical\ninitial conditions only varying the seed field strength. We find that magnetic\nfields grow as $\\rho^{2/3}$ during the gravitational collapse preceding star\nformation, as expected from ideal spherical collapse models. Massive Population\nIII stars can expel a majority of the gas from the host halo through radiative\nfeedback, and we find that the magnetic fields are not amplified above the\nspherical collapse scaling relation during this phase. However, afterwards when\nits supernova remnant can radiatively cool and fragment, the turbulent velocity\nfield in and around the shell causes the magnetic field to be significantly\namplified on average by $\\sim$100 in the shell and up to 6 orders of magnitude\nbehind the reverse shock. Within the shell, field strengths are on the order of\na few nG at a number density of 1 cm$^{-3}$. We show that this growth is\nprimarily caused by small-scale dynamo action in the remnant. These\nstrengthened fields will propagate into the first generations of galaxies,\npossibly affecting the nature of their star formation.\n", "  Recent gamma-ray observations and radio observations put strong constraints\non the parameters of dark matter annihilation. In this article, we derive new\nconstraints for six standard model annihilation channels by using the recent\nradio data of M31 galaxy. The new constraints are generally tighter than the\nconstraints obtained from 6 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope gamma-ray\nobservations of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies. The\nconservative lower limits of dark matter mass annihilating via $b\\bar{b}$,\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ channels are 90 GeV, 90 GeV and 80 GeV\nrespectively with the canonical thermal relic cross section and the Burkert\nprofile being the dark matter density profile. Hence, our results do not favor\nthe most popular models of the dark matter interpretation of the Milky Way GeV\ngamma-ray excess.\n", "  We study the dynamics of Brownian particles in a heterogeneous\none-dimensional medium with a spatially-dependent diffusion coefficient of the\nform $D(x)\\sim |x|^c$, at constant temperature. The particle's probability\ndistribution function (PDF) is calculated both analytically, by solving Fick's\ndiffusion equation, and from numerical simulations of the underdamped Langevin\nequation. At large times, the PDFs calculated by both approaches yield\nidentical results, corresponding to subdiffusion for $c<0$, and superdiffusion\nfor $0<c<1$. For $c>1$, the diffusion equation predicts that the particles\naccelerate. Here, we show that this phenomenon, previously considered in\nseveral works as an illustration for the possible dramatic effects of\nspatially-dependent thermal noise, is unphysical. We argue that in an\nisothermal medium, the motion cannot exceed the ballistic limit ($\\left\\langle\nx^2\\right\\rangle \\sim t^2$). The ballistic limit is reached when the friction\ncoefficient drops sufficiently fast at large distances from the origin, and is\ncorrectly captured by Langevin's equation.\n", "  A molecular dynamics simulation of the demixing process of a binary complex\nplasma is analysed and the role of distinct interaction potentials is discussed\nby using morphological Minkowski tensor analysis of the minority phase domain\ngrowth in a demixing simulated binary complex plasma. These Minkowski tensor\nmethods are compared with previous results that utilized a power spectrum\nmethod based on the time-dependent average structure factor. It is shown that\nthe Minkowski tensor methods are superior to the previously used power spectrum\nmethod in the sense of higher sensitivity to changes in domain size. By\nanalysis of the slope of the temporal evolution of Minkowski tensor measures\nqualitative differences between the case of particle interaction with a single\nlength scale compared to particle interactions with two different length scales\n(dominating long range interaction) are revealed. After proper scaling the\ngraphs for the two length scale scenario coincide, pointing towards universal\nbehaviour. The qualitative difference in demixing scenarios is evidenced by\ndistinct demixing behaviour: In the long range dominated cases demixing occurs\nin two stages. At first neighbouring particles agglomerate then domains start\nto merge in cascades. However in the case of only one interaction length scale\nonly agglomeration but no merging of domains can be observed. Thus, Minkowski\nTensor analysis are likely to become a useful tool for further investigation of\nthis (and other) demixing processes. It is capable to reveal (nonlinear) local\ntopological properties, probing deeper than (linear) global power spectrum\nanalysis, however still providing easily interpretable results founded on a\nsolid mathematical framework.\n", "  The optimum scheme for geometric phase measurement in EAST Tokamak is\nproposed in this paper. The theoretical values of geometric phase for the probe\nbeams of EAST Polarimeter-Interferometer (POINT) system are calculated by path\nintegration in parameter space. Meanwhile, the influences of some controllable\nparameters on geometric phase are evaluated. The feasibility and challenge of\ndistinguishing geometric effect in the POINT signal are also assessed in\ndetail.\n", "  We attempt to find a progenitor for the ultra-faint object Segue 1 under the\nassumption that it formed as a dark matter free star cluster in the past. We\nlook for orbits, using the elongation of Segue 1 on the sky as a tracer of its\npath. Those orbits are followed backwards in time to find the starting points\nof our N-body simulations. The successful orbit, with which we can reproduce\nSegue 1 has a proper motion of mu_alpha = -0.19 mas/yr and mu_delta = -1.9\nmas/yr, placing Segue 1 near its apo-galacticon today. Our best fitting model\nhas an initial mass of 6224 Msun and an initial scale-length of 5.75 pc.\n", "  We focus on a technique recently implemented for controlling the magnitude of\nsynthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in ultra-cold atoms in the Raman-coupling\nscenario. This technique uses a periodic modulation of the Raman-coupling\namplitude to tune the SOC. Specifically, it has been shown that the effect of a\nhigh-frequency sinusoidal modulation of the Raman-laser intensity can be\nincorporated into the undriven Hamiltonian via effective parameters, whose\nadiabatic variation can then be used to steer the SOC. Here, we characterize\nthe heating mechanisms that can be relevant to this method. We identify the\nmain mechanism responsible for the heating observed in the experiments as\nbasically rooted in driving-induced transfer of population to excited states.\nCharacteristics of that process determined by the harmonic trapping, the decay\nof the excited states, and the technique used for preparing the system are\ndiscussed. Additional heating, rooted in departures from adiabaticity in the\nvariation of the effective parameters, is also described. Our analytical study\nprovides some clues that may be useful in the design of strategies for curbing\nthe effects of heating on the efficiency of the control methods.\n", "  The origin of striations aligned along the local magnetic field direction in\nthe translucent envelope of the Taurus molecular cloud is examined with new\nobservations of 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 emission obtained with the 10~m\nsubmillimeter telescope of the Arizona Radio Observatory. These data identify a\nperiodic pattern of excess blue and redshifted emission that is responsible for\nthe striations. For both 12CO and 13CO, spatial variations of the J=2-1 to\nJ=1-0 line ratio are small and are not spatially correlated with the striation\nlocations. A medium comprised of unresolved CO emitting substructures (cells)\nwith a beam area filling factor less than unity at any velocity is required to\nexplain the average line ratios and brightness temperatures. We propose that\nthe striations result from the modulation of velocities and the beam filling\nfactor of the cells as a result of either the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability or\nmagnetosonic waves propagating through the envelope of the Taurus molecular\ncloud. Both processes are likely common features in molecular clouds that are\nsub-Alfvenic and may explain low column density, cirrus-like features similarly\naligned with the magnetic field observed throughout the interstellar medium in\nfar-infrared surveys of dust emission.\n", "  Recently, we extracted the strong coupling, $\\alpha_s(m_\\tau^2)$, from the\nrevised ALEPH data for non-strange hadronic tau decays. Our analysis is based\non a method previously used for the determination of the strong coupling from\nOPAL data. In our strategy, we employ different moments of the spectral\nfunctions both with and without pinching, including Duality Violations, in\norder to obtain fully self-consistent analyses that do not rely on untested\nassumptions (such as the smallness of higher dimension contributions in the\nOPE). Here we discuss the $\\alpha_s$ values obtained from the ALEPH and the\nOPAL data, the robustness of the analysis, as well as non-perturbative\ncontributions from DVs and the OPE. We show that, although the $\\alpha_s$\ndetermination is sound, non-perturbative effects limit the accuracy with which\none can extract the strong coupling from tau decay data. Finally, we discuss\nthe compatibility of the data sets and the possibility of a combined analysis.\n", "  A significant fraction of nearby young moving group members harbor\ncircumstellar debris dust disks. Due to their proximity and youth, these disks\nare attractive targets for studying the early evolution of debris dust and\nplanetesimal belts. Here we present 70 and 160$\\mu$m observations of 31 systems\nin the $\\beta$ Pic moving group, and in the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina\nand Argus associations, using the Herschel Space Observatory. None of these\nstars were observed at far-infrared wavelengths before. Our Herschel\nmeasurements were complemented by photometry from the WISE satellite for the\nwhole sample, and by submillimeter/millimeter continuum data for one source, HD\n48370. We identified six stars with infrared excess, four of them are new\ndiscoveries. By combining our new findings with results from the literature, we\nexamined the incidence and general characteristics of debris disks around\nSun-like members of the selected groups. With their dust temperatures of <45 K\nthe newly identified disks around HD 38397, HD 48370, HD 160305, and BD-20 951\nrepresent the coldest population within this sample. For HD 38397 and HD 48370,\nthe emission is resolved in the 70$\\mu$m PACS images, the estimated radius of\nthese disks is ~90 au. Together with the well-known disk around HD 61005, these\nthree systems represent the highest mass end of the known debris disk\npopulation around young G-type members of the selected groups. In terms of dust\ncontent, they resemble the hypothesized debris disk of the ancient Solar\nSystem.\n", "  We report the serendipitous discovery of HSC J142449-005322, a double source\nplane lens system in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We dub the\nsystem Eye of Horus. The lens galaxy is a very massive early-type galaxy with\nstellar mass of ~7x10^11 Msun located at z_L=0.795. The system exhibits two\narcs/rings with clearly different colors, including several knots. We have\nperformed spectroscopic follow-up observations of the system with FIRE on\nMagellan. The outer ring is confirmed at z_S2=1.988 with multiple emission\nlines, while the inner arc and counterimage is confirmed at z_S1=1.302. This\nmakes it the first double source plane system with spectroscopic redshifts of\nboth sources. Interestingly, redshifts of two of the knots embedded in the\nouter ring are found to be offset by delta_z=0.002 from the other knots,\nsuggesting that the outer ring consists of at least two distinct components in\nthe source plane. We perform lens modeling with two independent codes and\nsuccessfully reproduce the main features of the system. However, two of the\nlensed sources separated by ~0.7 arcsec cannot be reproduced by a smooth\npotential, and the addition of substructure to the lens potential is required\nto reproduce them. Higher-resolution imaging of the system will help decipher\nthe origin of this lensing feature and potentially detect the substructure.\n", "  Suspended droplets of cholesteric (chiral nematic) liquid crystals\nspontaneously rotate in the presence of a heat flux due to a temperature\ngradient, a phenomenon known as Lehmann effect. So far, it is not clear whether\nthis effect is due to the chirality of the phase and the molecules or only to\nthe chirality of the director field. Here, we report the continuous rotation in\na temperature gradient of nematic droplets of a lyotropic chromonic liquid\ncrystal featuring a twisted bipolar configuration. The achiral nature of the\nmolecular components leads to a random handedness of the spontaneous twist,\nresulting in the coexistence of droplets rotating in the two senses, with\nspeeds proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to\nthe droplet radius. This result shows that a macroscopic twist of the director\nfield is sufficient to induce a rotation of the droplets, and that the phase\nand the molecules do not need to be chiral. This suggests that one can also\nexplain the Lehmann rotation in cholesteric liquid crystals without introducing\nthe Leslie thermomechanical coupling -- only present in chiral mesophases. An\nexplanation based on the Akopyan and Zeldovich theory of thermomechanical\neffects in nematics is proposed and discussed.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of synthesis, structure analysis, transport\nand thermodynamic properties of the C14 Laves phase Ta(Fe1-xVx)2. Our\nmeasurements confirm the appearance of spin-density wave (SDW) order within a\ndome-like region of the x - T phase diagram with vanadium content 0.02 < x <\n0.3. Our results indicate that on approaching TaFe2 from the vanadium-rich\nside, ferromagnetic (FM) correlations increase faster than the\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) ones. This results in an exchange-enhanced\nsusceptibility and in the suppression of the SDW transition temperature for x <\n0.13 forming the dome-like shape of the phase diagram. This effect is strictly\nrelated to a significant lattice distortion of the crystal structure manifested\nin the c/a ratio. At x = 0.02 both FM and AFM energy scales have similar\nstrength and the system remains paramagnetic down to 2 K with an extremely\nlarge Stoner enhancement factor of about 400. Here, spin fluctuations dominate\nthe temperature dependence of the resistivity \\rho ~ T ^ 3/2 and of the\nspecific heat C/T ~ - log(T) which deviate from their conventional Fermi liquid\nforms, inferring the presence of a quantum critical point of dual nature.\n", "  High-redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) beyond redshift $\\sim6$ are potentially\npowerful tools to probe the distant early Universe. Their detections in large\nnumbers and at truly high redshifts call for the next generation of high-energy\nwide-field instruments with unprecedented sensitivity at least one order of\nmagnitude higher than the ones currently in orbit. On the other hand, follow-up\nobservations of the afterglows of high-redshift GRBs and identification of\ntheir host galaxies, which would be difficult for the currently operating\ntelescopes, require new, extremely large facilities of at multi-wavelengths.\nThis chapter describes future experiments that are expected to advance this\nexciting field, both being currently built and being proposed. The legacy of\nSwift will be continued by SVOM, which is equipped with a set of space-based\nmulti-wavelength instruments as well as and a ground segment including a wide\nangle camera and two follow-up telescopes. The established Lobster-eye X-ray\nfocusing optics provides a promising technology for the detection of faint GRBs\nat very large distances, based on which the {THESEUS}, {Einstein Probe} and\nother mission concepts have been proposed. Follow-up observations and\nexploration of the reionization era will be enabled by large facilities such as\n{SKA} in the radio, the 30m class telescopes in the optical/near-IR, and the\nspace-borne {WFIRST} and {JWST} in the optical/near-IR/mid-IR. In addition, the\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray polarization experiment POLAR is also introduced.\n", "  In this note, we discuss how possible expansion histories of the universe can\nbe inferred in a simple way, for arbitrary energy contents. No new physical\nresults are obtained, but the goal is rather to discuss an alternative way of\nwriting the Friedmann equation in order to facilitate an intuitive\nunderstanding of the possible solutions; for students and researchers alike. As\nhas been noted in passing by others, this specific form of the Friedmann\nequation allows us to view the universal expansion as a particle rolling along\na frictionless track. Specific examples depicted include the current\nconcordance cosmological model as well as a stable static universal model.\n", "  We argue that electromagnetic decays of energetic unflavoured neutral mesons,\nnotably $\\eta$, mis-identified as single photons due to granularity of the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter might create bump-like features in the diphoton\ninvariant mass spectrum at different energies, including 750 GeV. We discuss\nwhat kind of additional analysis can exclude or confirm this hypothesis.\n", "  Periodic dips observed in approx. 20% of low-mass X-ray binaries are thought\nto arise from obscuration of the neutron star by the outer edge of the\naccretion disk. We report the detection with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer of\ntwo dipping episodes in Aql X-1, not previously a known dipper. The X-ray\nspectrum during the dips exhibited an elevated neutral column density, by a\nfactor between 1 and almost two orders of magnitude. Dips were not observed in\nevery cycle of the 18.95-hr orbit, so that the estimated frequency for these\nevents is 0.10 (+0.07,-0.05)/cycle. This is the first confirmed example of\nintermittent dipping in such a system. Assuming that the dips in Aql X-1 occur\nbecause the system inclination is intermediate between the non-dipping and\ndipping sources, implies a range of 72-79 deg. for the source. This result\nlends support for the presence of a massive (> 2 M_sun) neutron star in Aql\nX-1, and further implies that approx. 30 additional LMXBs may have inclinations\nwithin this range, raising the possibility of intermittent dips in those\nsystems also. Thus, we searched for dips from 24 other bursting systems,\nwithout success. For the system with the largest number of dip phases covered,\n4U 1820-303, the nondetection implies a 95% upper limit to the dip frequency of\n1.4E-3/cycle.\n", "  Accurate calculations of the nuclear recoil effect to the Lamb shift of\nhydrogen-like atoms are presented. Numerical results are reported for the $ns$\nstates with $n \\leq 5$ and for the $2p_{1/2}$ and $2p_{3/2}$ states. The\ncalculations are performed to the first order in the electron-nucleus mass\nratio and to all orders in the nuclear binding strength parameter $Z\\alpha$\n(where $Z$ is the nuclear charge number and $\\alpha$ is the fine structure\nconstant). The obtained results provide accurate predictions for the\nhigher-order remainder beyond the known $Z\\alpha$-expansion terms. In the case\nof hydrogen, the remainder was found to be much larger than anticipated. This\nresult resolves the previously reported disagreement between the numerical\nall-order and the analytical $Z\\alpha$-expansion approaches for the nuclear\nrecoil effect in the hydrogen Lamb shift.\n", "  With use of a variational principle, we investigate a role of breathing width\ndegree of freedom in the effective theory of interacting vortices in a trapped\nsingle-component Bose-Einstein condensates in 2 dimensions under the strong\nrepulsive cubic nonlinearity. As for the trial function, we choose a product of\ntwo vortex functions assuming a pair interaction and employ the amplitude form\nof each vortex function in the Pad\\'e approximation which accommodates a\nhallmark of the vortex core. We have obtained Lagrange equation for the\ninteracting vortex-core coordinates coupled with the time-derivative of width\nand also its Hamilton formalism by having recourse to a non-standard Poisson\nbracket. By solving the Hamilton equation, we find rapid radial breathing\noscillations superposed on the slower rotational motion of vortex cores,\nconsistent with numerical solutions of Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In\nhigher-energy states of 2 vortex systems, the breathing width degree of freedom\nplays role of a kicking in the kicked rotator and generates chaos with a\nstructure of sea-urchin needles. Byproduct of the present variational approach\nincludes: (1) the charge-dependent logarithmic inter-vortex interaction\nmultiplied with a pre-factor which depends on the scalar product of a pair of\ncore-position vectors; (2) the charge-independent short-range repulsive\ninter-vortex interaction and spring force.\n", "  Due to their high strength and advantageous high-temperature properties,\ntungsten-based alloys are being considered as plasma-facing candidate materials\nin fusion devices. Under neutron irradiation, rhenium, which is produced by\nnuclear transmutation, has been found to precipitate in elongated precipitates\nforming thermodynamic intermetallic phases at concentrations well below the\nsolubility limit. Recent measurements have shown that Re precipitation can lead\nto substantial hardening, which may have a detrimental effect on the fracture\ntoughness of W alloys. This puzzle of sub-solubility precipitation points to\nthe role played by irradiation induced defects, specifically mixed solute-W\ninterstitials. Here, using first-principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory, we study the energetics of mixed interstitial defects in\nW-Re, W-V, and W-Ti alloys, as well as the heat of mixing for each\nsubstitutional solute. We find that mixed interstitials in all systems are\nstrongly attracted to each other with binding energies of -2.4 to -3.2 eV and\nform interstitial pairs that are aligned along parallel first-neighbor <111>\nstrings. Low barriers for defect translation and rotation enable defect\nagglomeration and alignment even at moderate temperatures. We propose that\nthese elongated agglomerates of mixed-interstitials may act as precursors for\nthe formation of needle-shaped intermetallic precipitates. This\ninterstitial-based mechanism is not limited to radiation induced segregation\nand precipitation in W-Re alloys but is also applicable to other body-centered\ncubic alloys.\n", "  Numerical simulation has been conducted for the chaotic flow in a 3D\nclosed-loop pulsating heat pipe (PHP). Heat flux and constant temperature\nboundary conditions were applied for evaporator and condenser sections,\nrespectively. Water and ethanol were used as working fluids. Volume of Fluid\n(VOF) method has been employed for two-phase flow simulation. Spectral analysis\nof temperature time series was carried out using Power Spectrum Density (PSD)\nmethod. Existence of dominant peak in PSD diagram indicated periodic or\nquasi-periodic behavior in temperature oscillations at particular frequencies.\nCorrelation dimension values for ethanol as working fluid was found to be\nhigher than that for water under the same operating conditions. Similar range\nof Lyapunov exponent values for the PHP with water and ethanol as working\nfluids indicated strong dependency of Lyapunov exponent to the structure and\ndimensions of the PHP. An O-ring structure pattern was obtained for\nreconstructed 3D attractor at periodic or quasi-periodic behavior of\ntemperature oscillations. Minimum thermal resistance of 0.85 degree/W and 0.88\ndegree/W were obtained for PHP with water and ethanol, respectively. Simulation\nresults showed good agreement with experimental results from other work under\nthe same operating conditions.\n", "  In the minimal gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension, there is\na coefficient whose physical consequences are unknown, and the reason behind\nthis lack of effects is still puzzling. This contribution summarizes several\nstudies where the goal was to find a fundamental explanation of this puzzle. So\nfar, no evidence of such a fundamental explanation has been found, suggesting\nthat this coefficient could actually produce physical effects. Nevertheless,\nwhile looking for this fundamental reason, several relevant lessons have been\nrevealed.\n", "  Conventional caustic methods in real or Fourier space produced accelerating\noptical beams only with convex trajectories. We develop a superposition caustic\nmethod capable of winding light beams along non-convex trajectories. We\nascertain this method by constructing a one-dimensional (1D) accelerating beam\nmoving along a sinusoidal trajectory, and subsequently extending to\ntwo-dimensional (2D) accelerating beams along arbitrarily elliptical helical\ntrajectories. We experimentally implement the method with a compact and robust\nintegrated optics approach by fabricating micro-optical structures on quartz\nglass plates to perform the spatial phase and amplitude modulation to the\nincident light, generating beam trajectories highly consistent with prediction.\nThe theoretical and implementation methods can in principle be extended to the\nconstruction of accelerating beams with a wide variety of non-convex\ntrajectories, thereby opening up a new route of manipulating light beams for\nfundamental research and practical applications.\n", "  A redefinition of the Lagrangian of a multi-particle system in fields\nreformulates the single-particle, kinetic, and fluid equations governing fluid\nand plasma dynamics as a single set of generalized Maxwell's equations and\nOhm's law for canonical force-fields. The Lagrangian includes new terms\nrepresenting the coupling between the motion of particle distributions, between\ndistributions and electromagnetic fields, with relativistic contributions. The\nformulation shows that the concepts of self-organization and canonical helicity\ntransport are applicable across single-particle, kinetic, and fluid regimes, at\nclassical and relativistic scales. The theory gives the basis for comparing\ncanonical helicity change to energy change in general systems. For example, in\na fixed, isolated system subject to non-conservative forces, a species'\ncanonical helicity changes less than total energy only if gradients in density\nor distribution function are shallow.\n", "  The ground-state properties of iron-group transition metals from Sc to Cu\nhave been investigated on the basis of the first-principles momentum dependent\nlocal ansatz (MLA) theory. Correlation energy gain is found to show large\nvalues for Mn and Fe: 0.090 Ry (Mn) and 0.094 Ry (Fe). The Hund-rule coupling\nenergies are found to be 3000 K (Fe), 1400 K (Co), and 300 K (Ni). It is\nsugested that these values can resolve the inconsistency in magnetic energy\nbetween the density functional theory and the first-principles dynamical\ncoherent potential approximation theory at finite temperatures. Charge\nfluctuations are shown to be suppressed by the intra-orbital correlations and\ninter-orbital charge-charge correlations, so that they show nearly constant\nvalues from V to Fe: 1.57 (V and Cr), 1.52 (Mn), and 1.44 (Fe), which are\nroughly twice as large as those obtained by the $d$ band model. The amplitudes\nof local moments are enhanced by the intra-orbital and inter-orbital spin-spin\ncorrelations and show large values for Mn and Fe: 2.87 (Mn) and 2.58 (Fe).\nThese values are in good agreement with the experimental values estimated from\nthe effective Bohr magneton number and the inner core photoemission data.\n", "  We propose a novel model to produce ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (UHECRs) in\ngamma-ray burst jets. After the prompt gamma-ray emission, hydrodynamical\nturbulence is excited in the GRB jets at or before the afterglow phase. The\nmildly relativistic turbulence stochastically accelerates protons. The\nacceleration rate is much slower than the usual first-order shock acceleration\nrate, but in this case it can be energy-independent. The resultant UHECR\nspectrum is so hard that the bulk energy is concentrated in the highest energy\nrange, resulting in a moderate requirement for the typical cosmic ray\nluminosity of $\\sim 10^{53.5}~\\mbox{erg}~\\mbox{s}^{-1}$. In this model, the\nsecondary gamma-ray and neutrino emissions initiated by photopion production\nare significantly suppressed. Although the UHECR spectrum at injection shows a\ncurved feature, this does not conflict with the observed UHECR spectral shape.\nThe cosmogenic neutrino spectrum in the $10^{17}$--$10^{18}$ eV range becomes\ndistinctively hard in this model, which may be verified by future observations.\n", "  A circularly polarized electromagnetic plane wave carries an electric field\nthat rotates clockwise or counterclockwise around the propagation direction of\nthe wave. According to the handedness of this rotation, its \\emph{longitudinal}\nspin angular momentum density is either parallel or antiparallel to the\npropagation of light. However, there are also light waves that are not simply\nplane and carry an electric field that rotates around an axis perpendicular to\nthe propagation direction, thus yielding \\emph{transverse} spin angular\nmomentum density. Electric field configurations of this kind have been\nsuggestively dubbed \"photonic wheels\". It has been recently shown that photonic\nwheels are commonplace in optics as they occur in electromagnetic fields\nconfined by waveguides, in strongly focused beams, in plasmonic and evanescent\nwaves. In this work we establish a general theory of electromagnetic waves\n{propagating along a well defined direction, which carry} transverse spin\nangular momentum density. We show that depending on the shape of {these waves,\nthe} spin density may be either perpendicular to the \\emph{mean} linear\nmomentum (globally transverse spin) or to the linear momentum \\emph{density}\n(locally transverse spin). We find that the latter case generically occurs only\nfor non-diffracting beams, such as the Bessel beams. Moreover, we introduce the\nconcept of \\emph{meridional} Stokes parameters to operationally quantify the\ntransverse spin density. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to the exemplary\ncases of Bessel beams and evanescent waves. These results open a new and\naccessible route to the understanding, generation and manipulation of optical\nbeams with transverse spin angular momentum density.\n", "  The majority of galaxies in the local Universe exhibit spiral structure with\na variety of forms. Many galaxies possess two prominent spiral arms, some have\nmore, while others display a many-armed flocculent appearance. Spiral arms are\nassociated with enhanced gas content and star-formation in the disks of\nlow-redshift galaxies, so are important in the understanding of star-formation\nin the local universe. As both the visual appearance of spiral structure, and\nthe mechanisms responsible for it vary from galaxy to galaxy, a reliable method\nfor defining spiral samples with different visual morphologies is required. In\nthis paper, we develop a new debiasing method to reliably correct for\nredshift-dependent bias in Galaxy Zoo 2, and release the new set of debiased\nclassifications. Using these, a luminosity-limited sample of ~18,000 Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey spiral galaxies is defined, which are then further\nsub-categorised by spiral arm number. In order to explore how different spiral\ngalaxies form, the demographics of spiral galaxies with different spiral arm\nnumbers are compared. It is found that whilst all spiral galaxies occupy\nsimilar ranges of stellar mass and environment, many-armed galaxies display\nmuch bluer colours than their two-armed counterparts. We conclude that\ntwo-armed structure is ubiquitous in star-forming disks, whereas many-armed\nspiral structure appears to be a short-lived phase, associated with more\nrecent, stochastic star-formation activity.\n", "  A debate has arisen concerning the fundamental nature of LBVs) and their role\nin stellar evolution. While Smith and Tombleson proposed that their isolated\nenvironments indicate that LBVs must be largely the product of binary\nevolution, Humphreys et al. have recently expressed the view that the\ntraditional single-star view still holds if one appropriately selects a\nsubsample of LBVs. This paper finds the claim of Humphreys et al. to be\nquantitatively unjustified. A statistical test of \"candidate\" as opposed to\n\"confirmed\" LBVs shows no significant difference ($<$1$\\sigma$) between their\nenvironments. Even if the sample is further subdivided as proposed, the three\nmost luminous LBVs are spatially dispersed similar to late O-type dwarfs, which\nhave much longer lifetimes than expected for classical LBVs. Lower-luminosity\nLBVs have a distribution associated with red supergiants (RSGs), but these RSGs\nare dominated by stars of 10-15 M$_{\\odot}$ initial mass, with much longer\nlifetimes than expected for those lower-luminosity LBVs. If one's view is\nrestricted to the highest-luminosity LBVs, then the appropriate comparison is\nwith early O-type stars that are their presumed progenitors, when this is done,\nit is clear that even the high-luminosity LBVs are more dispersed than\nexpected. Humphreys et al. also suggest that velocities of LBVs support the\nsingle-star view, being inconsistent with runaways. A quantitative analysis of\nthe radial velocity distribution of LBVS in M31 and M33 contradicts this,\nmodest runway speeds expected from mass gainers in binary evolution are\nconsistent with the observed velocities, although the data lack the precision\nto discriminate.\n", "  We report on the results of powder and single crystal neutron diffraction to\ninvestigate the magnetic order in YbCo$_2$Si$_2$ below the N\\'eel temperature\n$T_{\\rm N} = 1.7~$K in detail. Two different magnetically ordered phases can\nclearly be distinguished. At lowest temperatures a commensurate magnetic\nstructure with a propagation vector ${\\bf k}_1 = (0.25~ 0.25~ 1)$ is found,\nwhile the intermediate phase ($T > 0.9~$K) is characterized by an\nincommensurate magnetic structure with ${\\bf k}_2 = (0.25~ 0.086~ 1)$. The\nmagnetic structure in YbCo$_2$Si$_2$ is in marked contrast to all other known\nRCo$_2$Si$_2$ compounds (R = rare earth element) likely due to some itineracy\nof the Yb 4f states being responsible for the magnetism.\n", "  The atomic hydrogen formation channels of the C + C2H2 reaction have been\ninvestigated using a continuous supersonic flow reactor over the 52 K 296 K\ntemperature range. H-atoms were detected directly at 121.567 nm by vacuum\nultraviolet laser induced fluorescence. Absolute H-atom yields were determined\nby comparison with the H-atom signal generated by the C + C2H4 reaction. The\nproduct yields agree with earlier crossed beam experiments employing universal\ndetection methods. Incorporating these branching ratios in a gas-grain model of\ndense interstellar clouds increases the cC3H abundance. This reaction is a\nminor source of C3 containing molecules in the present simulations.\n", "  We perform transport measurements and band structure calculations of\nelectron-doped LaFeAsO1-xHx over a wide range of x from 0.01 to 0.66. The T^2\nand sqrt(T) dependency of the resistivity are observed at x ~ 0.17 and 0.41,\nrespectively. The sign change of RH without opening of the spin-density-wave\ngap for 0.45 < x < 0.58 and T < TN as well as the calculated non-nested Fermi\nsurface at x = 0.5 indicate the more localized nature of the AF2 as compared to\nspin density wave phase at non-doped sample. Considering the results from band\ncalculations and the finite size of Hund' s rule coupling, the change of the\nnormal conducting state with x is reasonably explained by a strong depression\nof the coherent scale owing to the increased effective Coulomb repulsion in the\nnarrow anti-bonding 3dxy band that approaches the half-filled regime. The\nfollowing transition from the paramagnet to AF2 is understood as the quenching\nor ordering of the less-screened spins with a large entropy at low temperature.\nThese results suggest that the normal conducting properties over a wide doping\nrange for the LaFeAsO1-xHx are strongly influenced by the local spins in the\nincoherent region. Thus, we conclude that the parent phase in LaFeAsO1-xHx is\nnot the spin-density wave but the AF2, which may be primarily responsible for\nthe singular superconducting properties of the 1111 type compared with other\niron pnictides.\n", "  There is evidence that coronal heating is highly intermittent, and flares are\nthe high energy extreme. The properties of the heat pulses are difficult to\nconstrain. Here hydrodynamic loop modeling shows that several large amplitude\noscillations (~ 20% in density) are triggered in flare light curves if the\nduration of the heat pulse is shorter that the sound crossing time of the\nflaring loop. The reason is that the plasma has not enough time to reach\npressure equilibrium during the heating and traveling pressure fronts develop.\nThe period is a few minutes for typical solar coronal loops, dictated by the\nsound crossing time in the decay phase. The long period and large amplitude\nmake these oscillations different from typical MHD waves. This diagnostic can\nbe applied both to observations of solar and stellar flares and to future\nobservations of non-flaring loops at high resolution.\n", "  Approximately $0.2 \\pm 0.2$ of white dwarfs (WDs) show signs of pollution by\nmetals, which is likely due to the accretion of tidally disrupted planetary\nmaterial. Models invoking planet-planet interactions after WD formation\ngenerally cannot explain pollution at cooling times of several Gyr. We consider\na scenario in which a planet is perturbed by Lidov-Kozai oscillations induced\nby a binary companion and exacerbated by stellar mass loss, explaining\npollution at long cooling times. Our computed accretion rates are consistent\nwith observations assuming planetary masses between $\\sim 0.01$ and\n$1\\,M_\\mathrm{Mars}$, although nongravitational effects may already be\nimportant for masses $\\lesssim 0.3 \\, M_\\mathrm{Mars}$. The fraction of\npolluted WDs in our simulations, $\\sim 0.05$, is consistent with observations\nof WDs with intermediate cooling times between $\\sim 0.1$ and 1 Gyr. For\ncooling times $\\lesssim 0.1$ Gyr and $\\gtrsim 1$ Gyr, our scenario cannot\nexplain the high observed pollution fractions of up to 0.7. Nevertheless, our\nresults motivate searches for companions around polluted WDs.\n", "  We report the emergence of a collective dynamical state, namely phase-flip\nchimera, from an en- semble of identical nonlinear oscillators that are coupled\nindirectly via the dynamical variables from a common environment, which in turn\nare nonlocally coupled. The phase-flip chimera is character- ized by the\ncoexistence of two adjacent out-of-phase synchronized coherent domains\ninterspersed by an incoherent domain, in which the nearby oscillators are in\nout-of-phase synchronized states. At- tractors of the coherent domains are\neither from the same or different basins of attractions depending on whether\nthey are periodic or chaotic. Conventional chimera precedes the phase-flip\nchimera in general. Further, the phase-flip chimera emerges after the\ncompletely synchronized evolution of the ensemble in contrast to conventional\nchimeras which emerge as an intermediate state between completely incoherent\nand coherent states. We have also characterized the observed dynamical\ntransitions using the strength of incoherence, probability distribution of\ncorrelation coefficient and the framework of master stability function.\n", "  Successful phenomenological models of pulsar wind nebulae assume efficient\ndissipation of the Poynting flux of the magnetized electron-positron wind as\nwell as efficient acceleration of the pairs in the vicinity of the termination\nshock, but how this is realized is not yet well understood. The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula. The required corrugation could be induced by the\nfast magnetosonic modes of downstream nebular turbulence; but it could also be\nproduced by upstream turbulence, either carried by the wind or seeded in the\nprecursor by the accelerated particles themselves.\n", "  A quasi-periodicity has been identified in the strange emission shifts in\npulsar B1859+07 and possibly B0919+06. These events, first investigated by\nRankin, Rodriguez & Wright in 2006, originally appeared disordered or random,\nbut further mapping as well as Fourier analysis has revealed that they occur on\na fairly regular basis of approximately 150 rotation periods in B1859+07 and\nperhaps some 700 in B0919+06. The events-which we now refer to as\n\"swooshes\"-are not the result of any known type of mode-changing, but rather we\nfind that they are a uniquely different effect, produced by some mechanism\nother than any known pulse-modulation phenomenon. Given that we have yet to\nfind another explanation for the swooshes, we have appealed to a last resort\nfor periodicities in astrophysics: orbital dynamics in a binary system. Such\nputative \"companions\" would then have semi-major axes comparable to the light\ncylinder radius for both pulsars. However, in order to resist tidal disruption\ntheir densities must be at least some 10$^5$ grams/cm$^3$-therefore white-dwarf\ncores or something even denser might be indicated.\n", "  Spiral structure in disk galaxies is modeled with nine collisionless N-body\nsimulations including live disks, halos, and bulges with a range of masses. Two\nof these simulations make long-lasting and strong two-arm spiral wave modes\nthat last for $\\sim5$ Gyr with constant pattern speed. These two had a light\nstellar disk and the largest values of the Toomre $Q$ parameter in the inner\nregion at the time the spirals formed, suggesting the presence of a Q-barrier\nto wave propagation resulting from the bulge. The relative bulge mass in these\ncases is about 10\\%. Models with weak two-arm spirals had pattern speeds that\nfollowed the radial dependence of the Inner Lindblad Resonance.\n", "  We use simple toy models of far-IR dust emission to estimate the accuracy to\nwhich the polarization of the cosmic microwave background can be recovered\nusing multi-frequency fits, if the parametric form chosen for the fitted dust\nmodel differs from the actual dust emission. Commonly used approximations to\nthe far-IR dust spectrum yield CMB residuals comparable to or larger than the\nsensitivities expected for the next generation of CMB missions, despite fitting\nthe combined CMB + foreground emission to precision 0.1% or better. The\nRayleigh-Jeans approximation to the dust spectrum biases the fitted dust\nspectral index by Delta beta_d = 0.2 and the inflationary B-mode amplitude by\nDelta r = 0.03. Fitting the dust to a modified blackbody at a single\ntemperature biases the best-fit CMB by Delta r > 0.003 if the true dust\nspectrum contains multiple temperature components. A 13-parameter model fitting\ntwo temperature components reduces this bias by an order of magnitude if the\ntrue dust spectrum is in fact a simple superposition of emission at different\ntemperatures, but fails at the level Delta r = 0.006 for dust whose spectral\nindex varies with frequency. Restricting the observing frequencies to a narrow\nregion near the foreground minimum reduces these biases for some dust spectra\nbut can increase the bias for others. Data at THz frequencies surrounding the\npeak of the dust emission can mitigate these biases while providing a direct\ndetermination of the dust temperature profile.\n", "  In an intensive observational campaign in the 9 month duration of Chandra\nX-ray Visionary Project that was conducted in the year 2012, 39 large X-ray\nflares of Sgr A* were recorded. An analysis of the times of the observed flares\nreveals that the 39 flares are separated in time by intervals that are grouped\naround integer numbers times 0.10333 days. This time interval is thus the\nperiod of a uniform grid of equally spaced points on the time axis. The\ngrouping of the flares around tic marks of this grid is derived from the data\nwith at least a 3.2 {\\sigma} level of statistical significance. No signal of\nany period can be found among 22 flares recorded by Chandra in the years\n2013-2014. If the 0.10333 d period is that of a nearly circular Keplerian orbit\naround the blackhole at the center of the Galaxy, its radius is at 7.6\nSchwarzschild radii. Large flares were more likely to be triggered when the\nagent responsible for their outbursts was near the peri-center phase of its\nslightly eccentric orbit.\n", "  We study vortex charging caused by the Lorentz force on supercurrent based on\nthe augmented quasiclassical equa- tions of superconductivity. Our numerical\nstudy on an s-wave vortex lattice in the range $H_{{\\rm{c}}1} < H <\nH_{{\\rm{c}}2}$ reveals that each vortex core with a single flux quantum also\naccumulates charge due to the circulating supercurrent and has a Hall voltage\nacross the core. The field dependence of the charge density at the core center\nis well described by $H(H_{{\\rm{c}}2}-H)$ with a peak near $H_{{\\rm{c}}2}/2$\noriginating from competition between the increasing magnetic field and the\ndecreasing pair potential. The peak value of the accumulated charge in a core\nregion of radius $0.5\\xi_0$ is estimated to be about $\\eta\\Delta_{0}/(k_{\\rm\nF}\\xi_0)\\times|e|$ C per $\\Delta z=1$ nm along the flux line at low\ntemperatures, where $\\eta\\equiv\\pi\\epsilon_0\\Delta z/|e|^2=1.09\\times10^{18}$\n${\\rm{J^{-1}}}$ with $e<0$ the charge of an electron, $\\Delta_0$ the energy gap\nat $T=0$, $k_{\\rm F}$ the Fermi wave number, and $\\xi_0$ the coherence length\nat $T=0$.\n", "  Using an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model, we examine the\neffects of an electric field induced by a variable magnetic field on the\n\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+} ratio in central to peripheral heavy-ion collisions at beam\nenergies of 400 and 1500MeV/nucleon. It is shown that while the induced\nelectric field does not affect the total multiplicities of both $\\pi^{-}$ and\n$\\pi^{+}$ mesons at both the lower beam energy of 400MeV/nucleon and the higher\nbeam energy of 1500MeV/nucleon, it reduces (enhances) the emission of $\\pi^{-}$\n($\\pi^{+}$) mesons in midrapidity, but enhances (reduces) the emission of\n$\\pi^{-}$ ($\\pi^{+}$) mesons in forward and backward rapidities especially for\nthe more peripheral collisions at the lower beam energy because of the rapidly\ntransient variable magnetic field at more peripheral collisions and longer\nreaction duration time at the lower beam energy. These findings indicate that\nthe total \\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+} ratio is still a precisely reliable probe of symmetry\nenergy at both the lower and higher beam energies, but one should consider the\ninduced electric field when using the differential \\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+} ratio to\nprobe the symmetry energy especially for the lower beam energy and more\nperipheral collisions. Finally, the relative suppression factor based on the\nratio of \\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+} in different rapidities is proposed to be an effective\nprobe of the induced electric field generated in heavy-ion collisions due to\nits maximizing effects of induced electric fields on the differential\n\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+} ratio but minimizing effects of some uncertainty factors in\nheavy-ion collisions.\n", "  We present deep imaging observations of activated asteroid P/2016 G1\n(PANSTARRS) using the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) from late April to\nearly June 2016. The images are best interpreted as the result of a relatively\nshort-duration event with onset about $\\mathop{350}_{-30}^{+10}$ days before\nperihelion (i.e., around 10th February, 2016), starting sharply and decreasing\nwith a $\\mathop{24}_{-7}^{+10}$ days (Half-width at half-maximum, HWHM). The\nresults of the modeling imply the emission of $\\sim$1.7$\\times$10$^7$ kg of\ndust, if composed of particles of 1 micrometer to 1 cm in radius, distributed\nfollowing a power-law of index --3, and having a geometric albedo of 0.15. A\ndetailed fitting of a conspicuous westward feature in the head of the\ncomet-like object indicates that a significant fraction of the dust was ejected\nalong a privileged direction right at the beginning of the event, which\nsuggests that the parent body has possibly suffered an impact followed by a\npartial or total disruption. From the limiting magnitude reachable with the\ninstrumental setup, and assuming a geometric albedo of 0.15 for the parent\nbody, an upper limit for the size of possible fragment debris of $\\sim$50 m in\nradius is derived.\n", "  We present new observations of the galaxy cluster 3C 129 obtained with the\nSardinia Radio Telescope in the frequency range 6000-7200 MHz, with the aim to\nimage the large-angular-scale emission at high-frequency of the radio sources\nlocated in this cluster of galaxies. The data were acquired using the\nrecently-commissioned ROACH2-based backend to produce full-Stokes image cubes\nof an area of 1 deg x 1 deg centered on the radio source 3C 129. We modeled and\ndeconvolved the telescope beam pattern from the data. We also measured the\ninstrumental polarization beam patterns to correct the polarization images for\noff-axis instrumental polarization. Total intensity images at an angular\nresolution of 2.9 arcmin were obtained for the tailed radio galaxy 3C 129 and\nfor 13 more sources in the field, including 3C 129.1 at the galaxy cluster\ncenter. These data were used, in combination with literature data at lower\nfrequencies, to derive the variation of the synchrotron spectrum of 3C 129\nalong the tail of the radio source. If the magnetic field is at the\nequipartition value, we showed that the lifetimes of radiating electrons result\nin a radiative age for 3C 129 of t_syn = 267 +/- 26 Myrs. Assuming a linear\nprojected length of 488 kpc for the tail, we deduced that 3C 129 is moving\nsupersonically with a Mach number of M=v_gal/c_s=1.47. Linearly polarized\nemission was clearly detected for both 3C 129 and 3C 129.1. The linear\npolarization measured for 3C 129 reaches levels as high as 70% in the faintest\nregion of the source where the magnetic field is aligned with the direction of\nthe tail.\n", "  Discs of dusty debris around main-sequence star indicate fragmentation of\norbiting planetesimals, and for a few A-type stars, a gas component is also\nseen that may come from collisionally-released volatiles. Here we find the\nsixth example of a CO-hosting disc, around the 30Myr old A0-star HD 32297. Two\nmore of these CO-hosting stars, HD 21997 and 49 Cet, have also been imaged in\ndust with SCUBA-2 within the SONS project. A census of 27 A-type debris hosts\nwithin 125 pc now shows 7/16 detections of carbon-bearing gas within the 5-50\nMyr epoch, with no detections in 11 older systems. Such a prolonged period of\nhigh fragmentation rates corresponds quite well to the epoch when most of the\nEarth was assembled from planetesimal collisions. Recent models propose that\ncollisional products can be spatially asymmetric if they originate at one\nlocation in the disc, with CO particularly exhibiting this behaviour as it can\nphotodissociate in less than an orbital period. Of the six CO-hosting systems,\nonly beta Pic is in clear support of this hypothesis. However, radiative\ntransfer modelling with the ProDiMo code shows that the CO is also hard to\nexplain in a proto-planetary disc context.\n", "  Evidence for the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the\noptical polarization of the blazar PKS 2155-304, during a period of enhanced\ngamma-ray brightness, is presented. The periodogram of the polarized flux\nrevealed the existence of a prominent peak at $T\\sim 13$ min, detected at\n>99.7% significance, and $T\\sim 30$ min, which was nominally significant at\n>99%. This is the first evidence of QPOs in the polarization of an active\ngalactic nucleus, potentially opening up a new avenue of studying this\nphenomenon.\n", "  The optimization version of the cavity method for single instances, called\nMax-Sum, has been applied in the past to the Minimum Steiner Tree Problem on\nGraphs and variants. Max-Sum has been shown experimentally to give\nasymptotically optimal results on certain types of weighted random graphs, and\nto give good solutions in short computation times for some types of real\nnetworks. However, the hypotheses behind the formulation and the cavity method\nitself limit substantially the class of instances on which the approach gives\ngood results (or even converges). Moreover, in the standard model formulation,\nthe diameter of the tree solution is limited by a predefined bound, that\naffects both computation time and convergence properties. In this work we\ndescribe two main enhancements to the Max-Sum equations to be able to cope with\noptimization of real-world instances. First, we develop an alternative 'flat'\nmodel formulation, that allows to reduce substantially the relevant\nconfiguration space, making the approach feasible on instances with large\nsolution diameter, in particular when the number of terminal nodes is small.\nSecond, we propose an integration between Max-Sum and three greedy heuristics.\nThis integration allows to transform Max-Sum into a highly competitive\nself-contained algorithm, in which a feasible solution is given at each step of\nthe iterative procedure. Part of this development participated on the 2014\nDIMACS challenge on Steiner Problems, and we report the results here.\n", "  Resonant x-ray emission spectroscopy (RXES) was employed at the U L3\nabsorption edge and the La1 emission line to explore the 5f occupancy, nf, and\nthe degree of 5f orbital delocalization in the hidden order compound URu2Si2.\nBy comparing to suitable reference materials such as UF4, UCd11, and alpha-U,\nwe conclude that the 5f orbital in URu2Si2 is at least partially delocalized\nwith nf = 2.87 +/- 0.08, and does not change with temperature down to 10 K\nwithin the estimated error. These results place further constraints on\ntheoretical explanations of the hidden order, especially those requiring a\nlocalized f2 ground state.\n", "  The quantum bounce a priori connects several (semi)classical epochs of\nUniverse evolution, however determining if and how well the semiclassicality is\npreserved in this transition is highly nontrivial. We review the present state\nof knowledge in that regards in the isotropic sector of loop quantum cosmology.\nThis knowledge is next extended by studies of an isotropic universe admitting\npositive cosmological constant (featuring an infinite chain of large Universe\nepochs). It is also shown, that such universe always admits a semiclassical\nepoch thanks to spontaneous spontaneous coherence, provided it is semiclassical\nin certain constant of motion playing the role of energy.\n", "  Gauge invariance dictates that a resonance produced from initial state gluons\nmust be produced through a non-renormalizable operator or a loop process.\nShould such a resonance be discovered, uncovering the dynamics that give rise\nto its couplings to gluons will be crucial to understanding the nature of the\nnew state. Here we study how the production of this resonance at high\ntransverse momentum in association with one (or more) jets can be used to\ndirectly measure the scale of the operator or the mass of the particles in the\nloop. We use a 750 GeV diphoton resonance as an example application, and we\nstudy how the non-renormalizable operator case can be described by a slowly\nconverging effective field theory (EFT) expansion with operators of dimension\nfive and seven. We show that with O(100) events, one can put strong constraints\non the scale of the EFT, particularly in theories with strong coupling. We also\ncompare the EFT analysis to that of a UV completion with vector-like quarks,\nand outline how the mass of said quarks could be measured.\n", "  The nearby red dwarf binary GJ65AB (UB+BL Ceti, M5.5Ve+M6Ve) is a cornerstone\nsystem to probe the physics of very low mass stars. We present new\ninterferometric measurements of the angular diameters of the two components of\nGJ65AB with the PIONIER instrument in the H band: thetaUD (A) = 0.558 +/- 0.008\n+/- 0.020 mas and thetaUD (B) = 0.539 +/- 0.009 +/- 0.020 mas. They translate\ninto limb-darkened angular diameters of LD (A) = 0.573 +/- 0.021 mas and LD (B)\n= 0.554 +/- 0.022 mas. From the known parallax, the radii are R(A) = 0.165 +/-\n0.006 Rsun and R(B) = 0.159 +/- 0.006 Rsun (sigma(R)/R = 4%). We also observed\nGJ65AB with the VLT/NACO adaptive optics and refine the orbital parameters and\ninfrared magnitudes of the system. We derive masses for the two components of\nm(A) = 0.1225 +/- 0.0043 Msun and m(B) = 0.1195 +/- 0.0043 Msun (sigma(m)/m =\n4%). To derive the radial and rotational velocities of the two stars, as well\nas their relative metallicity with respect to Proxima, we also present new\nindividual UVES high resolution spectra. Placing GJ65 A&B in the mass-radius\ndiagram shows that their radii are larger respectively by 14 +/- 4% and 12 +/-\n4% compared to expectations from the models by Baraffe et al. (2015). Following\nChabrier et al. (2007), we propose that this discrepancy is caused by the\ninhibition of convective energy transport by a strong internal magnetic field\ngenerated by dynamo effect in these two fast rotating stars. A comparison with\nthe almost identical twin but slowly-rotating Proxima strengthens this\nhypothesis, as the radius of Proxima does not appear inflated compared to\nmodels.\n", "  We show that mixed-phase titanium dioxide (TiO2) can be effectively employed\nas an unconventional, inorganic, dual-emitting and ratiometric optical sensor\nof O2. Simultaneous availability of rutile and anatase TiO2 PL and their\npeculiar anti-correlated PL responses to O2 allow using their ratio as\nmeasurement parameter associated to O2 concentration, leading to an\nexperimental responsivity being by construction larger than the one obtainable\nfor single-phase PL detection. A proof of this concept in given, showing a\ntwo-fold enhancement of the optical responsivity provided by the ratiometric\napproach. Besides the peculiar ratiometric-enhanced responsivity, other\ncharacteristics of mixed phase TiO2 can be envisaged as favorable for O2\noptical probing, namely: a) low production costs, b) absence of heterogeneous\ncomponents, c) self-supporting properties. These characteristics encourage\nexperimenting its use for applications requiring high indicator quantities at\ncompetitive price, possibly also tackling the need to develop supporting\nmatrixes that carry the luminescent probes and avoiding issues related to the\nuse of different components for ratiometric sensing.\n", "  Statistical systems composed of atoms interacting with each other trough\nnonintegrable interaction potentials are considered. Examples of these\npotentials are hard-core potentials and long-range potentials, for instance,\nthe Lennard-Jones and dipolar potentials. The treatment of such potentials is\nknown to confront several problems, e.g., the impossibility of using the\nstandard mean-field approximations, such as Hartree and Hartree-Fock\napproximations, the impossibility of directly introducing coherent states, the\ndifficulty in breaking the global gauge symmetry, which is required for\ndescribing Bose-Einstein condensed and superfluid systems, the absence of a\ncorrectly defined Fourier transform, which hampers the description of uniform\nmatter as well as the use of local-density approximation for nonuniform\nsystems. A novel iterative procedure for describing such systems is developed,\nstarting from a correlated mean-field approximation, allowing for a systematic\nderivation of higher orders, and meeting no problems listed above. The\nprocedure is applicable to arbitrary systems, whether equilibrium or\nnonequilibrium. The specification for equilibrium systems is presented. The\nmethod of extrapolating the expressions for observable quantities from weak\ncoupling to strong coupling is described.\n", "  When the Standard-Model Extension (SME) is applied in curved spacetime, the\nLorentz-violation coefficients must depend on spacetime position. This work\ndescribes some of the consequences of this spacetime variation. We focus on\neffects that appear at a nonrelativistic scale and extract sensitivity of\ncompleted experiments to derivatives of SME coefficient fields.\n", "  Investigations of thermal evolution of neutron stars with hyperon cores\nrequire neutrino emissivities for many neutrino reactions involving strongly\ndegenerate particles (nucleons, hyperons, electrons, muons). We calculate the\nangular integrals $I_n$ (over orientations of momenta of $n$ degenerate\nparticles) for major neutrino reactions with $n$ =3, 4, 5 at all possible\ncombinations of particle Fermi momenta. The integrals $I_n$ are necessary\ningredients for constructing a uniform database of neutrino emissivities in\ndense nucleon-hyperon matter. The results can also be used in many problems of\nphysical kinetics of strongly degenerate systems.\n", "  We study the effect of salts on the thickness of wetting films on melting ice\nand interactions acting on CO$_2$ bubble near ice-water and vapor-water\ninterfaces. Governing mechanisms are the Lifshitz and the double-layer\ninteractions in the respective three-layer geometries. We demonstrate that the\nlatter depend on the Casimir--Polder interaction of the salt ions dissolved in\nwater with the respective ice, vapour and CO$_2$ interfaces, as calculated\nusing different models for their effective polarizability in water. Significant\nvariation in the predicted thickness of the equilibrium water film is observed\nfor different salt ions and when using different models for the ions'\npolarizabilities. We find that CO$_2$ bubbles are attracted towards ice-water\ninterface and repelled from the vapor-water interface\n", "  A method for automated quantification of the alignment of one-dimensional\nnanostructures from microscopy imaging is presented. Nanostructure alignment\nmetrics are formulated and shown to able to rigorously quantify the\norientational order of nanostructures within a two-dimensional domain\n(surface). A complementary image processing method is also presented which\nenables robust processing of microscopy images where overlapping nanostructures\nmight be present. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanowire-covered\nsurfaces are analyzed using the presented methods and it is shown that past\nsingle parameter alignment metrics are insufficient for highly aligned domains.\nThrough the use of multiple parameter alignment metrics, automated quantitative\nanalysis of SEM images is shown to be possible and the alignment\ncharacteristics of different samples are able to be rigorously compared using a\nsimilarity metric. The results of this work provide researchers in nanoscience\nand nanotechnology with a rigorous method for the determination of\nstructure/property relationships where alignment of one-dimensional\nnanostructures is significant.\n", "  In the present paper, we extend the study of Del Popolo (2010) to determine\nthe slope of the inner density profile of galaxy haloes with different\nmorphologies. We study how galaxy morphology changes the relation between the\ninner slope of the galaxy halo density profile, $\\alpha$, and the stellar mass,\n$M_{*}$, or rotation velocity $V_{\\rm rot}$. For this, we use the model of Del\nPopolo (2009) in combination with observed data from the Romanowsky \\& Fall\n(2012) sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, the Local Group sample\ncompiled by McConnachie (2012), and the simulation results by Cloet-Osselaer et\nal. (2014). We find that the slope $\\alpha$ flattens monotonically, from\n$\\alpha \\simeq -1 $ at $V_{\\rm rot} \\simeq 250$ km/s, to $\\alpha \\simeq 0 $.\nAfter $V_{\\rm rot}\\simeq 25$ km/s the slope starts to steepen. The steepening\nhappens in the mass range dominated by non-rotationally supported galaxies\n(e.g., dSphs) and depends on the level of offset in the angular momentum of\nrotationally and non-rotationally dominated galaxies. The steepening is a\nconsequence of the decrease in baryons content, and angular momentum in\nspheroidal dwarf galaxies. We finally compare our result to the SPH simulations\nof Di Cintio. Our result is in qualitatively agreement with their simulations,\nwith the main difference that the inner slope $\\alpha$ at small stellar masses\n($M_* \\lesssim10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) is flatter than that in their simulations. As\na result, the claim that finding a core in dwarf galaxies with masses slightly\nsmaller than $\\simeq 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, (as in the Di Cintio, or Governato,\nsupernovae feedback mechanism) would be a problem for the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nmust be probably revised.\n", "  In this work we develop an ab initio informed rate theory model to track the\nspatial and temporal evolution of implanted ions (Cr+) in Fe and Fe-14%Cr\nduring high dose irradiation. We focus on the influence of the specimen\nsurface, the depth dependence of ion-induced damage, the damage rate, and the\nconsequences of ion implantation, all of which influence the depth dependence\nof alloy composition evolving with continued irradiation. We investigate\nchemical segregation effects in the material by considering the diffusion of\nthe irradiation-induced defects. Moreover, we explore how temperature, grain\nsize, grain boundary sink strength, and defect production bias modify the\nresulting distribution of alloy composition. Our results show that the\nimplanted ion profile can be quite different than the predicted SRIM\nimplantation profile due to radiation enhanced transport and segregation.\n", "  I present high-precision results for top quark production at hadron collider\nenergies. Total and differential cross sections are calculated through aN$^3$LO\nfor top-antitop pair production and through aNNLO for single-top production.\nTop production in association with a charged Higgs boson and via anomalous\ncouplings is also briefly discussed.\n", "  We add 9 new observations of NY Vir and identify four others from AASVO\ndatabase. Our results indicste that the one and two exo-planet predictions made\nby earlier authors do not match these new results.\n", "  I present a new derivation of Hawking radiation by applying the Crooks\nfluctuation theorem to the laws of black hole thermodynamics. Then, by analogy\nwith the quantum fluctuation theorem, this allows one to identify microstates\ncontributing to the black hole entropy. These microstates have an evolution\noperator on the horizon between initial and final states that is related to the\nentropic gravity proposal. Their full calculation perhaps requires a deeper\nunderstanding of nonperturbative Hawking radiation.\n", "  We propose an explanation of the LHC data excess resonance of 750 GeV in the\ndiphoton distribution using D-brane models, with gauged baryon number, which\naccommodate the Standard Model together with vector like exotics. We identify\nthe 750 GeV scalar as either the sneutrino (${\\tilde \\nu}_R$) or as an axion.\nUsing a bottom-up approch, ${\\tilde \\nu}_R$ is produced via gluon fusion when\nscalar (supersymmetric) partners of vector like quarks and leptons are\ngenerated by demanding that the corresponding intersections respect N=1\nsupersymmetry. When we generate the value of ${\\tilde \\nu}_R$ at 750 GeV, by\nvarying the complex structure of the torus, the string scale is limited to be\nin the range $ 10^{14} < M_s < 10^{19}$ GeV. Also, generating the Higgs scalars\nby imposing N=1 supersymmetry on intersections fixes naturally, to zero, the\ncoupling of the axion to SU(2) gauge bosons $\\propto F_b \\wedge F_b$ and in\nphoton-photon fusion also decouples its coupling from $G^2$ of color SU(3) by\nsimultaneously generating the superpartners of $q_L$, $U_R$, $l_L$, $\\nu_R$\nquarks and leptons.\n", "  The first V Rc Ic bands light curves of MQ UMa are presented and analyzed\nusing the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) program. It is discovered that MQ UMa is an\nA-subtype contact binary with a high fill-out (f=82 %) and a low mass ratio (q\n= 0:195), which indicates that it is in the late evolutionary stage of latetype\ntidal-locked binary stars. The mass of the primary and secondary stars are\nestimated and the evolutionary status of the two components are placed in the\nH-R diagram. The W-D solutions also indicates that MQ UMa may be a triple\nsystem with an F5V type additional component. A sample of sixteen high fillout,\nlow mass ratio overcontact binaries are collected and their possible evolution\nscenarios are discussed. Using the five times of light minimum recently\nobserved together with those collected from literatures, the authors find that\nthe observedcalculate (O-C) curve exhibits a cyclic period variation. The\ncyclic period change also reveals the presence of a tertiary component, which\nmay play an important role in the formation and evolution of this binary system\nby drawing angular momentum from the central system.\n", "  The first four-color light curves of V868 Mon in the $B$ $V$ $R_c$ and $I_c$\nbands are presented and analyzed by using the Wilson-Devinney method of the\n2013 version. It is discovered that V868 Mon is an A-subtype contact binary\n(f=$58.9\\,\\%$) with a large temperature difference of 916$K$ between the two\ncomponents. Using the eight new times of light minimum determined by the\nauthors together with those collected from literatures, the authors found that\nthe general trend of the observed-calculate ($O$-$C$) curve shows a upward\nparabolic variation that corresponds to a long-term increase in the orbital\nperiod at a rate of $dP/dt=9.38\\times{10^{-7}}day\\cdot year^{-1}$. The\ncontinuous increase may be caused by a mass transfer from the less massive\ncomponent to the more massive one.\n", "  The light curve of V921 Her in ultraviolet band observed by the Lunar-based\nUltraviolet Telescope (LUT) is analyzed by the Wilson-Devinney code. Our\nsolutions conclude that V921 Her is an early type marginal contact binary\nsystem with an additional close-in component. The binary system is under poor\nthermal contact with a temperature difference of nearly $700K$ between the two\ncomponents. The close-in component contributes about $19\\,\\%$ of the total\nluminosity in the triple system. Combining the radial velocity study together\nwith our photometric solutions, the mass of the primary star and secondary one\nare calculated to be $M_1 = 1.784(\\pm0.055)M_\\odot$, $M_2 =\n0.403(\\pm0.012)M_\\odot$. The evolutionary scenario of V921 Her is discussed.\nAll times of light minimum of V921 Her available in the bibliography are taken\ninto account and the $O - C$ curve is analyzed for the first time. The most\nprobable fitting results are discussed in the paper, which also confirm the\nexistence of a third component ($P_3=10.2$ year) around the binary system. The\nperiod of V921 Her is also undergoing a continuously rapid increase at a rate\nof $dP/dt=+2.79\\times{10^{-7}}day\\cdot year^{-1}$, which may due to mass\ntransfer from the less massive component to the more massive one.\n", "  We present a new approach to tracking of radiation sources moving on smooth\ntrajectories which can be approximated with piece-wise linear joins or\npiece-wise linear parabolas. We employ the use of cheap binary proximity\nsensors which only indicate when a radiation source enters and leaves its\nsensing range. We present two separate cases. The first is considering that the\ntrajectory can be approximated with piece-wise linear joins. We develop a novel\nscalable approach in terms of the number of sensors required. Robustness\nanalysis is done with respect to uncertainties in the timing recordings by the\nradiation sensors. We show that in the noise free case, a minimum of three\nsensors will suffice to recover one piece of the linear join with probability\none, even in the absence of knowledge of the speed and statistics of the\nradiation source. Second, we tackle a more realistic approximation of\ntrajectories of radiation sources -- piece-wise parabolic joins -- and show\nthat no more than six sensors are required in the noise free case to track one\npiece of the parabola with probability one. Next we present an upper bound on\nthe achievable error variance in the estimation of the constant speed and the\nangle of elevation of linear trajectories. Finally, a comprehensive set of\nsimulations are presented to illustrate the robustness of our approach in the\npresence of uncertainties.\n", "  A scaler has been fabricated to count the signals from any radiation de-\ntector. It can count signals of frequency up to 140 kHz. Transistor Transistor\nLogic (TTL) is used in this scaler. In this article the details of the design,\nfabrication and operation processes of the scaler is presented.\n", "  Nuclear physics has been playing an important role in modern astrophysics and\ncosmology. Since the early 1950's it has been successfully applied for the\ninterpretation and prediction of astrophysical phenomena. Nuclear physics\nmodels helped to explain the observed elemental and isotopic abundances and\nstar evolution and provided valuable insights on the Big Bang theory. Today,\nthe variety of elements observed in stellar surfaces, solar system and cosmic\nrays, and isotope abundances are calculated and compared with the observed\nvalues. Consequently, the overall success of the modeling critically depends on\nthe quality of underlying nuclear data that helps to bring physics of macro and\nmicro scales together. To broaden the scope of traditional nuclear astrophysics\nactivities and produce additional complementary information, I will investigate\napplicability of the U.S. Nuclear Data Program (USNDP) databases for\nastrophysical applications. EXFOR (Experimental Nuclear Reaction Data) and ENDF\n(Evaluated Nuclear Data File) libraries have large astrophysics potential; the\nformer library contains experimental data sets while the latter library\nincludes evaluated neutron cross sections. ENSDF (Evaluated Nuclear Structure\nData File) database is a primary depository of nuclear structure and decay\nrates information. The decay rates are essential in stellar nucleosynthesis\ncalculations, and these rates are evaluated using nuclear structure codes. The\nstructure evaluation codes are pure mathematical procedures that can be applied\nto diverse data samples. A brief review of astrophysical nuclear data needs has\nbeen presented. Several opportunities and the corresponding computer tools have\nbeen identified. Further work will include extensive analysis of nuclear\ndatabases and computer procedures for astrophysical calculations.\n", "  The existence of solutions to Cauchy type problems of linear\nRiemann-Liouville fractional differential equations with variable coefficients\nis considered in a space of integrable functions. First, we consider the\nexistence and uniqueness of solution for a Cauchy type problem with special\ninitial conditions in the space of integrable functions. Then we provide an\nexample of the problem that has no solution in the space of integrable\nfunctions. We give a solving method and a representation of solutions for the\nCauchy type problem. Last we give some examples.\n", "  The experiment described in this paper is the first study of the response of\na static tungsten powder sample to an impinging high energy proton beam pulse.\nThe experiment was carried out at the HiRadMat facility at CERN. Observations\ninclude high speed videos of a proton beam induced perturbation of the powder\nsample as well as data from a laser Doppler vibrometer measuring the\noscillations of the powder container. A comparison with a previous analogous\nexperiment which studied a proton beam interaction with mercury is made\n", "  The harmonic chain is a classical many-particle system which can be solved\nexactly for arbitrary number of particles (at least in simple cases, such as\nequal masses and spring constants). A nice feature of the harmonic chain is\nthat the final result for the displacements of the individual particles can be\neasily understood -- therefore, this example fits well into a course of\nclassical mechanics for undergraduates. Here we show how to calculate the\ndisplacements by solving equations of motion for the Laplace transforms\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{q_n\\right\\}(s)$ of the displacements $q_n(t)$. This leads to\na continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms which can be\nevaluated analytically. The inverse Laplace transform of\n$\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{q_n\\right\\}(s)$ finally gives the displacements which\ngenerically have the form of Bessel functions. We also comment on the\nsimilarities between this approach and the Green function method for quantum\nmany-particle systems.\n", "  Multi-layer networks are networks on a set of entities (nodes) with multiple\ntypes of relations (edges) among them where each type of relation/interaction\nis represented as a network layer. As with single layer networks, community\ndetection is an important task in multi-layer networks. A large group of\npopular community detection methods in networks are based on optimizing a\nquality function known as the modularity score, which is a measure of presence\nof modules or communities in networks. Hence a first step in community\ndetection is defining a suitable modularity score that is appropriate for the\nnetwork in question. Here we introduce several multi-layer network modularity\nmeasures under different null models of the network, motivated by empirical\nobservations in networks from a diverse field of applications. In particular we\ndefine the multi-layer configuration model, the multi-layer expected degree\nmodel and their various modifications as null models for multi-layer networks\nto derive different modularities. The proposed modularities are grouped into\ntwo categories. The first category, which is based on degree corrected\nmulti-layer stochastic block model, has the multi-layer expected degree model\nas their null model. The second category, which is based on multi-layer\nextensions of Newman-Girvan modularity, has the multi-layer configuration model\nas their null model. These measures are then optimized to detect the optimal\ncommunity assignment of nodes. We compare the effectiveness of the measures in\ncommunity detection in simulated networks and then apply them to four real\nnetworks.\n", "  The structural complexity of metamaterials is limitless, although in\npractice, most designs comprise periodic architectures which lead to materials\nwith spatially homogeneous features. More advanced tasks, arising in e.g. soft\nrobotics, prosthetics and wearable tech, involve spatially textured mechanical\nfunctionality which require aperiodic architectures. However, a na\\\"ive\nimplementation of such structural complexity invariably leads to frustration,\nwhich prevents coherent operation and impedes functionality. Here we introduce\na combinatorial strategy for the design of aperiodic yet frustration-free\nmechanical metamaterials, whom we show to exhibit spatially textured\nfunctionalities. We implement this strategy using cubic building blocks -\nvoxels - which deform anisotropically, a local stacking rule which allows\ncooperative shape changes by guaranteeing that deformed building blocks fit as\nin a 3D jigsaw puzzle, and 3D printing. We show that, first, these aperiodic\nmetamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, where the 2D pixelated\nsurface texture dictates the 3D interior voxel arrangement. Second, they act as\nprogrammable shape shifters, morphing into spatially complex but predictable\nand designable shapes when uniaxially compressed. Third, their mechanical\nresponse to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform\nsensing and pattern analysis. Combinatorial design thus opens a new avenue\ntowards mechanical metamaterials with unusual order and machine-like\nfunctionalities.\n", "  A function for the bed-load sediment transport rate is derived. This is\nachieved from the first principle by using the entrainment probabilities of the\nsediment grains by rolling and lifting, and by introducing two travel lengths,\nrespectively, for the first time. The predictions from the new bed-load\nfunction agree well with the experimental results over the entire experimental\nrange and show significant improvement over the commonly used formula for\nbed-load transport rate. The new function shows that, in terms of contributing\nto the bed-load transport rate, the total entrainment probability of the\nsediment grains is a weighted summation of those by the lifted and rolling\ngrains, rather than a simple addition of the two. The function has also been\nused to predict the total entrainment probability, saltation length and the bed\nlayer thickness at high bed-load transport rate. These predictions all agree\nwell with the experimental results. It is found that, on average, the travel\nlength for the rolling sand grains is about one order of magnitude less than\nthat for the lifted ones.\n", "  It is commonly accepted that optical sub-Rayleigh imaging has potential\napplication in many fields. In this Letter, by confining the divergence of the\noptical field, as well as the size of the illumination source, we show that the\nfirst-order averaged intensity measurement via speckle laser illumina- tion can\nmake an actual breakthrough on the Rayleigh limit. For a high-order algorithm,\nit has been reported that the autocorrelation function can be utilized to\nachieve the sub-Rayleigh feature. However, we find that this sub- Rayleigh\nfeature for the high-order algorithm is limited only to binary objects, and the\nimage will be distorted when a gray object is placed. This property encourages\nus to find the physics behind the high-order correlation imaging algo- rithm.\nWe address these explanations in this Letter and find that for different types\nof high-order algorithm, there is always a seat in the right place from the\ncross-correlation function.\n", "  This paper suggests an axiomatic approach to Maxwell's equations. The basis\nof this approach is a theorem formulated for two sets of functions localized in\nspace and time. If each set satisfies a continuity equation then the theorem\nprovides an integral representation for each function. A corollary of this\ntheorem yields Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles. It is pointed out\nthat the causality principle and the conservation of electric and magnetic\ncharges are the most fundamental physical axioms underlying these equations.\nAnother application of the corollary yields Maxwell's equations in material\nmedia. The theorem is also formulated in the Minkowski space-time and applied\nto obtain the covariant form of Maxwell's equations with magnetic monopoles and\nthe covariant form of Maxwell's equations in material media. The approach makes\nuse of the infinite-space Green function of the wave equation and is therefore\nsuitable for an advanced course in electrodynamics.\n", "  We study packings of bidispersed spherical particles on a spherical surface.\nThe presence of curvature necessitates defects even for monodispersed\nparticles; bidispersity either leads to a more disordered packing for nearly\nequal radii, or a higher fill fraction when the smaller particles are\naccomodated in the interstices of the larger spheres. Variation in the packing\nfraction is explained by a percolation transition, as chains of defects or\nscars previously discovered in the monodispersed case grow and eventually\ndisconnect the neighbor graph.\n", "  The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new optical/near-infrared multi-fiber\nspectrograph designed for the prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. PFS\nwill cover a 1.3 degree diameter field with 2394 fibers to complement the\nimaging capabilities of Hyper SuprimeCam. To retain high throughput, the final\npositioning accuracy between the fibers and observing targets of PFS is\nrequired to be less than 10um. The metrology camera system (MCS) serves as the\noptical encoder of the fiber motors for the configuring of fibers. MCS provides\nthe fiber positions within a 5um error over the 45 cm focal plane. The\ninformation from MCS will be fed into the fiber positioner control system for\nthe closed loop control. MCS will be located at the Cassegrain focus of Subaru\ntelescope in order to to cover the whole focal plane with one 50M pixel Canon\nCMOS camera. It is a 380mm Schmidt type telescope which generates a uniform\nspot size with a 10 micron FWHM across the field for reasonable sampling of\nPSF. Carbon fiber tubes are used to provide a stable structure over the\noperating conditions without focus adjustments. The CMOS sensor can be read in\n0.8s to reduce the overhead for the fiber configuration. The positions of all\nfibers can be obtained within 0.5s after the readout of the frame. This enables\nthe overall fiber configuration to be less than 2 minutes. MCS will be\ninstalled inside a standard Subaru Cassgrain Box. All components that generate\nheat are located inside a glycol cooled cabinet to reduce the possible image\nmotion due to heat. The optics and camera for MCS have been delivered and\ntested. The mechanical parts and supporting structure are ready as of spring\n2016. The integration of MCS will start in the summer of 2016.\n", "  Statistical mechanics can predict thermal equilibrium states for most\nclassical systems, but for an isolated quantum system there is no general\nunderstanding on how equilibrium states dynamically emerge from the microscopic\nHamiltonian. For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually\nfail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale and, instead,\nrelax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by\nstatistical mechanics when approximately conserved quantities are appropriately\nincluded in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Here we experimentally study\nthe relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a\nlong-range transverse field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For\nsufficiently long-ranged interactions the system relaxes to a new type of\nprethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. In\nthis case, the prethermal state cannot be described by a GGE, but rather arises\nfrom an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This\nresult shows that prethermalization occurs in a significantly broader context\nthan previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding\nof the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of\nlong-range interactions.\n", "  Some time ago the possibility of classical (without Gamow tunneling)\nuniversal description of radioactive nuclei decay was demonstrated. Such\npossibility is basis on the classical interpretation of Bohmian Psi-field\nreality in Bohmian-Chetaev mechanics and the hypothesis for the presence of\ndissipative forces, generated from the Gryzinski translational precession of\nthe charged particles spin, in Langevin- Kramers diffusion mechanism. In this\npaper is present an unified model of proton, alpha decay, cluster radioactivity\nand spontaneous fission half-life as explicit function which depends on the\ntotal decay energy and kinetic energy, the number of protons and neutrons of\ndaughter product, the number of protons and neutrons of mother nuclei and from\na set) unknown digital parameters. The Half- lifes of the 573 nuclei taken from\nNuDat database together with the recent experimental data from Oganessian\nprovide a basis for discovering the explicit form of the Kramers solution of\nLangevin type equation in a framework of inverse problem with the help of the\nAlexandrov dynamic auto-regularization method (FORTRAN program REGN-Dubna). The\nprocedure LCH in program REGN permitts to reduce the number of unknown digital\nparameters from 137 to 79. The model describes 424 decays quantities with\ndeviation of order one in years power scale.\n", "  Money laundering is a major global problem, enabling criminal organisations\nto hide their ill-gotten gains and to finance further operations. Prevention of\nmoney laundering is seen as a high priority by many governments, however\ndetection of money laundering without prior knowledge of predicate crimes\nremains a significant challenge. Previous detection systems have tended to\nfocus on individuals, considering transaction histories and applying anomaly\ndetection to identify suspicious behaviour. However, money laundering involves\ngroups of collaborating individuals, and evidence of money laundering may only\nbe apparent when the collective behaviour of these groups is considered. In\nthis paper we describe a detection system that is capable of analysing group\nbehaviour, using a combination of network analysis and supervised learning.\nThis system is designed for real-world application and operates on networks\nconsisting of millions of interacting parties. Evaluation of the system using\nreal-world data indicates that suspicious activity is successfully detected.\nImportantly, the system exhibits a low rate of false positives, and is\ntherefore suitable for use in a live intelligence environment.\n", "  The temperature dependence of exchange bias properties are studied in\npolycrystalline $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} / \\mathrm{Ni_{81}Fe_{19}} $ bilayers, for\ndifferent $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} $ thicknesses. Using a field cooling protocol, a\nnon-monotonic behavior of the exchange bias field is shown in the\nexchange-biased bilayers. Another thermal protocol, the Soeya protocol, related\nto the $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} $ thermal activation energies was carried out and\nreveals a two-step evolution of the exchange bias field. The results of these\ntwo different protocols are similar to the ones obtained for measurements\npreviously reported on epitaxial $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} $, indicating a driving\nmechanism independent of the long-range crystalline arrangement (i.e.,\nepitaxial or polycrystalline). An intrinsic property of $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} $ is\nproposed as being the driving mechanism for the thermal dependent magnetization\nreversal: the canting of the $ \\mathrm{BiFeO_3} $ spins leading to a\nbiquadratic contribution to the exchange coupling. The temperature dependence\nof the magnetization reversal angular behavior agrees with the presence of such\na biquadratic contribution for exchange biased bilayers studied here.\n", "  In this paper we calculate charge fluctuations of a Schwarzschild black-hole\nof mass $M$ confined within a perfectly reflecting cavity of radius R in\nthermal equilibrium with various species of radiation and fermions . Charge\nconservation is constrained by a Lagrange multiplier (the chemical potential).\nBlack hole charge fluctuations are expected owing to continuous absorption and\nemission of particles by the black hole. For black holes much more massive than\n$10^{16} g$ , these fluctuations are exponentially suppressed. For black holes\nlighter than this, the Schwarzschild black hole is unstable under charge\nfluctuations for almost every possible size of the confining vessel. The\nstability regime and the fluctuations are calculated through the second\nderivative of the entropy with respect to the charge. The expression obtained\ncontains many puzzling terms besides the expected thermodynamical fluctuations:\nterms corresponding to instabilities that do not depend on the specific value\nof charge of the charge carriers and one of them depends on Newton's constant\ninstead. One of the contributions to the charge fluctuations $\\hbar/4\\pi$ does\nnot depend neither on number of species, nor on the the specific charge or even\nthe size of the confining vessel. As a matter of fact, this term emerges from\nthe second derivative of the black hole entropy alone, which means that it\ncorresponds to a genuine quantum mechanical property of the black hole itself.\nSuch a contribution would cause the event horizon to recede from $2M$ to\n$2M-T_{BH}$ or equivalently, by $(4\\pi)^{-1}$ of the black hole' s Compton wave\nlength. Similarly, a Cauchy horizon emerges at the same distance the event\nhorizon receded.\n", "  The comment by K. Hansen suggests that the time-of-flight mass spectrometry\ndata in one table in our paper from 2103 in IJMS should be due to a proton\ncontamination and correspond to protons p instead of deuterons D. The evidence\nfor such a suggestion is a re-plotting of our data, giving a bond distance of\n5.0 pm instead of 2.3 pm, corresponding to state s = 3 instead of s = 2 in the\nultra-dense hydrogen. However, protium has indeed been studied on the next\npages in our paper, giving shorter time-of-flights as expected. A replotting of\nour protium results as suggested by Hansen gives a best fit mass of 0.6 u,\nshowing that the suggested procedure gives consistently too small mass. Hansen\nalso rejects the rotational energy transfer model as due to our use of D in the\nanalysis of the data. However, this model has been applied successfully in two\nprevious publications, including experiments using protium. Hansen also\nsuggests that the protium is due to a contamination of the source; however, the\ngas feed (H2 or D2) and its result is well controlled and monitored. The most\nlikely source of protons was instead laser-induced nuclear fusion, but the\nlaser intensity in these experiments was a factor three too low to give strong\nfusion. Thus, the suggestion by Hansen is not valid.\n", "  We present the results of the short-term constancy monitoring of candidate\nGaia Spectrophotometric Standard Stars (SPSS). We obtained time series of\ntypically 1.24 hour - with sampling periods from 1-3 min to a few hours,\ndepending on the case - to monitor the constancy of our candidate SPSS down to\n10 mmag, as required for the calibration of Gaia photometric data. We monitored\n162 out of a total of 212 SPSS candidates. The observing campaign started in\n2006 and finished in 2015, using 143 observing nights on nine different\ninstruments covering both hemispheres. Using differential photometry\ntechniques, we built light curves with a typical precision of 4 mmag, depending\non the data quality. As a result of our constancy assessment, 150 SPSS\ncandidates were validated against short term variability, and only 12 were\nrejected because of variability including some widely used flux standards such\nas BD+174708, SA 105-448, 1740346, and HD 37725.\n", "  This paper is devoted to study the circumstances favourable to detect\ncircumstellar and circumbinary planets in well detached binary-star-systems\nusing eclipse timing variations (ETVs). We investigated the dynamics of well\ndetached binary star systems with a star separation from 0.5 to 3~AU, to\ndetermine the probability of the detection of such variations with ground based\ntelescopes and space telescopes (like former missions CoRoT and Kepler and\nfuture space missions Plato, Tess and Cheops). For the chosen star separations\nboth dynamical configurations (circumstellar and circumbinary) may be\nobservable. We performed numerical simulations by using the full three-body\nproblem as dynamical model. The dynamical stability and the ETVs are\ninvestigated by computing ETV maps for different masses of the secondary star\nand the exoplanet (Earth, Neptune and Jupiter size). In addition we changed the\nplanet's and binary's eccentricities. We conclude that many amplitudes of ETVs\nare large enough to detect exoplanets in binary star systems. As an\napplication, we prepared statistics of the catalogue of exoplanets in binary\nstar systems which we introduce in this article and compared the statistics\nwith our parameter-space which we used for our calculations. In addition to\nthese statistics of the catalogue we enlarged them by the investigation of well\ndetached binary star systems from several catalogues and discussed the\npossibility of further candidates.\n", "  Some radio pulsar profiles (in particular those of millisecond pulsars\ncontain wide emission structures which cover large intervals of pulse phase.\nLocal distortions of an average curve of polarisation angle (PA) can be\nidentified in such profiles, and they are often found to be associated with\nabsorption features or narrow emission components. The features may be\ninterpreted as a convolution of a lateral profile of an emitter with a\nmicroscopic radiation pattern of a non-negligible angular extent. We study a\nmodel which assumes that such an extended microbeam of the X-mode curvature\nradiation is spreading the radiation polarised at a fixed position angle within\nan interval of pulse phase. The model is capable of interpreting the strongly\ndissimilar polarisation of double notches in PSR B1821-24A (for which we\npresent new polarisation data from the Nancay Radio Telescope) and PSR\nJ0437-4715. It also explains a step-like change in PA observed at the\nbifurcated trailing component in the profile of J0437-4715. A generic form of\nthe modelled PA distortion is a zigzag-shaped wiggle, which in the presence of\nthe second polarisation mode (O mode) can be magnified or transformed into a W-\nor U-shaped deflection of a total net PA. The model's efficiency in\ninterpreting dissimilar polarisation effects provides further credence to the\nstream-based (fan-beam) geometry of pulsar emission. It also suggests that the\nmicrobeam width may not always be assumed negligible in comparison with the\nangular scale of emissivity gradients in the emission region.\n", "  Silicon has been long known as a poor light emitter due to its indirect band\ngap and strong phonon-assisted decay of the excited states. Nevertheless, we\nhave revealed efficient quasi-monochromatic photoluminescence at 368 nm from\nbulk silicon in the near-violet spectral range of the interband transition\nSiE{\\Gamma}1 even at room temperature. Optical and electron spectroscopy\nexperiments showed a clear relation of the emission to a surface plasmon\npolariton (SPP) located on the SiO/Si interface. The presented results\ndemonstrate that the unveiled luminescence is an effect of creation and decay\nof the SPP being a mixture of the surface plasmon, light, and the bulk\ninterband transition. The SPP evolves in the silicon layer with a thickness of\nthe order of the near-violet wave penetration depth (~80 nm) and is\ncharacterized by high excitation amplitude due to its hybrid nature. The effect\nseems to be easily applicable in developing near-violet light sources based on\nthe existing Si-technology.\n", "  Active and passive control strategies of internal pressure for hot forming of\ntubes and profiles with granular media are described. Force transmission and\nplastic deformation of granular medium is experimentally investigated. Friction\nbetween tube, granular medium and die as also the external stress field are\nshown to be essential for the process understanding. Wrinkling, thinning and\ninsufficient forming of the tube establishes the process window for the active\npressure process. By improving the punch geometry and controlling tribological\nconditions, the process limits are extended. Examples for the passive pressure\nprocess reveal new opportunities for hot forming of tubes and profiles.\n", "  Recently, an asymptotic solution of the Rayleigh equation for an empty bubble\nin $N$ dimensions has been obtained. Here we give the closed--from general\nanalytical solution of this equation. We also find the general solution of the\nRayleigh equation in $N$ dimensions for the case of a gas--filled\nhyperspherical bubble. In addition, we include a surface tension into\nconsideration.\n", "  A preliminary results of measurement of the spectra of Single Bubble\nSonoluminescence (SBSL) in water are presented. Analysis concentrates on\nsimilarity and differences of spectra from black-body radiation like shape.\n", "  We have shown intriguing similarities between Schwinger balls and black\nholes. By considering black hole as a gravitational Schwinger ball, we have\nderived the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the first law of black hole\nthermodynamics as a direct result of the inverse area dependence of the\ngravitational force. It is also shown that the Planck length is nothing but the\ngravitational Schwinger length. The relation between the mass and the radius of\nthe black hole is derived by considering the black hole as a Schwinger ball of\ngravitons. We show how the evolution of the entanglement entropy of the black\nhole, as Page introduced many years ago, can be obtained by including gravitons\nin the black hole's evaporation process and using a deformed EPR mechanism.\nAlso this deformed EPR mechanism can solve the information paradox. We show how\nnaive simultaneous usage of Page's argument and equivalence principle leads to\nfirewall problem.\n", "  We study the perturbed Burgers-Korteweg-de Vries equation. This equation can\nbe used for the description of nonlinear waves in a liquid with gas bubbles and\nfor the description of nonlinear waves on a fluid layer flowing down an\ninclined plane. We investigate the integrability of this equation using the\nPainlev\\'{e} approach. We show that the perturbed Burgers-Korteweg-de Vries\nequation does not belong to the class of integrable equations. Classical and\nnonclassical symmetries admitted by this equation and corresponding symmetry\nreductions are constructed. New types of periodic analytical structures\ndescribed by the Burgers-Korteweg-de Vries equation are found.\n", "  We propose the design of a Resonance SPin-echo spECtrometer for exTreme\nstudies, RESPECT, that is ideally suited for the exploration of non-dispersive\nprocesses such as diffusion, crystallization, slow dynamics, tunneling\nprocesses, crystal electric field excitations, and spin fluctuations. It is a\nvariant of the conventional neutron spin-echo technique (NSE) by i) replacing\nthe long precession coils by pairs of longitudinal neutron spin-echo coils\ncombined with RF-spin flippers and ii) by stabilizing the neutron polarization\nwith small longitudinal guide fields that can in addition be used as field\nsubtraction coils thus allowing to adjust the field integrals over a range of 8\norders of magnitude. Therefore, the dynamic range of RESPECT can in principle\nbe varied over 8 orders of magnitude in time, if neutrons with the required\nenergy are made available. Similarly as for existing NSE-spectrometers, spin\necho times of up to approximately 1 microsecond can be reached if the\ndivergence and the correction elements are properly adjusted. Thanks to the\noptional use of neutron guides and the fact that the currents for the\ncorrection coils are much smaller than in standard NSE, intensity gains of at\nleast one order of magnitude are expected , making the concept of RESPECT also\ncompetitive for operation at medium flux neutron sources. RESPECT can also be\noperated in a MIEZE configuration allowing the investigation of relaxation\nprocesses in depolarizing environments as they occur when magnetic fields are\napplied at the sample position, i.e. for the investigation of the dynamics of\nflux lines in superconductors, magnetic fluctuations in ferromagnetic\nmaterials, and samples containing hydrogen.\n", "  Multi-objective evaluation is a necessary aspect when managing complex\nsystems, as the intrinsic complexity of a system is generally closely linked to\nthe potential number of optimization objectives. However, an evaluation makes\nno sense without its robustness being given (in the sense of its reliability).\nStatistical robustness computation methods are highly dependent of underlying\nstatistical models. We propose a formulation of a model-independent framework\nin the case of integrated aggregated indicators (multi-attribute evaluation),\nthat allows to define a relative measure of robustness taking into account data\nstructure and indicator values. We implement and apply it to a synthetic case\nof urban systems based on Paris districts geography, and to real data for\nevaluation of income segregation for Greater Paris metropolitan area. First\nnumerical results show the potentialities of this new method. Furthermore, its\nrelative independence to system type and model may position it as an\nalternative to classical statistical robustness methods.\n", "  Complementarity have been an intriguing feature of physical systems for a\nlong time. In this work we establish a new kind of complimentary relations in\nthe frame work of quantum information processing tasks. In broadcasting of\nentanglement we create many pairs of less entangled states from a given\nentangled state both by local and non local cloning operations. These entangled\nstates can be used in various information processing tasks like teleportation\nand superdense coding. Since these states are less entangled states it is quite\nintuitive that these states are not going to be as powerful resource as the\ninitial states. In this work we study the usefulness of these states in tasks\nlike teleportation and super dense coding. More precisely, we found out bounds\nof their capabilities in terms of several complimentary relations involving\nfidelity of broadcasting. In principle we have considered general mixed as a\nresource also separately providing different examples like a) Werner like\nstates, b) Bell diagonal states. Here we have used both local and non local\ncloning operations as means of broadcasting. In the later part of our work, we\nextend this result by obtaining bounds in form of complimentary relations in a\nsituation where we have used $1-N$ cloning transformations instead of $1-2$\ncloning transformations.\n", "  The ground-state hyperfine splitting of antihydrogen promises one of the most\nsensitive tests of CPT symmetry. The ASACUSA collaboration is pursuing a\nmeasurement of this splitting in a Rabi-type experiment using a polarized beam\nfrom a CUSP magnet at the Antiproton Decelerator of CERN. With the initial\nintention of characterizing the Rabi apparatus, a polarized source of cold\nhydrogen was built and the $\\sigma_1$ transition of hydrogen was measured to a\nfew ppb precision. A measurement of the $\\pi_1$ transition is being prepared.\nThe availability of this beam opens the possibility to perform first\nmeasurements of some coefficients within the nonminimal Standard-Model\nExtension.\n", "  Electronic spectra of C$_6$H are measured in the $18\\,950-21\\,100$ cm$^{-1}$\ndomain using cavity ring-down spectroscopy of a supersonically expanding\nhydrocarbon plasma. In total, 19 (sub)bands of C$_6$H are presented, all\nprobing the vibrational manifold of the B$^2\\Pi$ electronically excited state.\nThe assignments are guided by electronic spectra available from matrix\nisolation work, isotopic substitution experiments (yielding also spectra for\n$^{13}$C$_6$H and C$_6$D), predictions from ab initio calculations as well as\nrotational fitting and vibrational contour simulations using the available\nground state parameters as obtained from microwave experiments. Besides the\n$0_0^0$ origin band, three non-degenerate stretching vibrations along the\nlinear backbone of the C$_6$H molecule are assigned: the $\\nu_6$ mode\nassociated with the C-C bond vibration and the $\\nu_4$ and $\\nu_3$ modes\nassociated with C$\\equiv$C triple bonds. For the two lowest $\\nu_{11}$ and\n$\\nu_{10}$ bending modes, a Renner-Teller analysis is performed identifying the\n$\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{11}$) and both $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{10}$) and\n$\\kappa^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{10}$) components. In addition, two higher lying bending\nmodes are observed, which are tentatively assigned as $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_9$)\nand $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_8$) levels. In the excitation region below the first\nnon-degenerate vibration ($\\nu_6$), some $^2\\Pi-^{2}\\Pi$ transitions are\nobserved that are assigned as even combination modes of low-lying bending\nvibrations. The same holds for a $^2\\Pi-^{2}\\Pi$ transition found above the\n$\\nu_6$ level. From these spectroscopic data and the vibronic analysis a\ncomprehensive energy level diagram for the B$^2\\Pi$ state of C$_6$H is derived\nand presented.\n", "  The numerical solution of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE)\npresents challenges not encountered in the simulation of PDEs or SDEs. Indeed,\nthe roughness of the noise in conjunction with nonlinearities in the drift\ntypically make these equations particularly stiff. In practice, this means that\nit is tricky to construct, operate, and validate numerical methods for SPDEs.\nThis is especially true if one is interested in path-dependent expected values,\nlong-time simulations, or in the simulation of SPDEs whose solutions have\nconstraints on their domains. To address these numerical issues, this paper\nintroduces a Markov jump process approximation for SPDEs, which we refer to as\nthe spectral random walk method (SPECTRWM). The accuracy and ergodicity of\nSPECTRWM are verified in the context of a heat and overdamped Langevin SPDE,\nrespectively. We also apply the method to Burgers and KPZ SPDEs.\n", "  Kinematic studies of the Hipparcos catalogue have revealed associations that\nare best explained as disintegrating multiple systems, presumably resulting\nfrom a dynamical encounter between single/multiple systems in the field (Li et\nal. 2009). In this work we explore the possibility that known ultra-cool dwarfs\nmay be components of disintegrating multiple systems, and consider the\nimplications for the properties of these objects. We will present here the\nmethods/techniques that can be used to search for and identify disintegrating\nbenchmark systems in three database/catalogues: Dwarf Archive, the Hipparcos\nMain Catalogue, and the Gliese-Jahrei{\\ss} Catalogue. Placing distance\nconstraints on objects with parallax or colour-magnitude information from\nspectrophotometry allowed us to identify common distance associations. Proper\nmotion measurements allowed us to separate common proper motion multiples from\nour sample of disintegrating candidates. Moreover, proper motion and positional\ninformation allowed us to select candidate systems based on relative component\npositions that were tracked back and projected forward through time. Using this\nmethod we identified one candidate disintegrating quadruple association, and\ntwo candidate disintegrating binaries, all of them containing one ultra-cool\ndwarf.\n", "  In this article we study some classical aspects of Podolsky Electrodynamics\nin the static regime. We develop the multipole expansion for the theory in both\nthe electrostatic and the magnetostatic cases. We also address the problem of\nconsistently truncating the infinite series associated with the several kinds\nof multipoles, yielding approximations for the static Podolskian\nelectromagnetic field to any degree of precision required. Moreover, we apply\nthe general theory of multipole expansion to some specific physical problems.\nIn those problems we identify the first terms of the series with the monopole,\ndipole and quadrupole terms in the generalized theory. We also propose a\nsituation in which Podolsky theory can be experimentally tested.\n", "  Tangles of string typically become knotted, from macroscopic twine down to\nlong-chain macromolecules such as DNA. Here we demonstrate that knotting also\noccurs in quantum wavefunctions, where the tangled filaments are vortices\n(nodal lines/phase singularities). The probability that a vortex loop is\nknotted is found to increase with its length, and a wide gamut of knots from\nstandard tabulations occur. The results follow from computer simulations of\nrandom superpositions of degenerate eigenstates of three simple quantum\nsystems: a cube with periodic boundaries, the isotropic 3-dimensional harmonic\noscillator and the 3-sphere. In the latter two cases, vortex knots occur\nfrequently, even in random eigenfunctions at relatively low energy, and are\nconstrained by the spatial symmetries of the modes. The results suggest that\nknotted vortex structures are generic in complex 3-dimensional wave systems,\nestablishing a topological commonality between wave chaos, polymers and\nturbulent Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  In quantum systems, a plausible definition of work is based on two energy\nmeasurement scheme. Considering that energy change of quantum system obeys a\ntime-energy uncertainty relation, it shall be interesting to see whether such\ntype of work as well obeys an analogous uncertainty relation. In this note I\nargue that this relation indeed exists for closed quantum systems and open\nquantum systems, which the latter are assumed to be weakly coupled with their\nenvironments.\n", "  In this work we study the reinforcement of polymers by mechanically\ninterlocked derivatives of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). We compare\nthe mechanical properties of fibers made of polymers and of composites with\npristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), mechanically interlocked\nderivatives of SWNTs (MINTs) and the corresponding supramolecular models.\nImprovements of both Young's modulus and tensile strength of up to 200 % were\nobserved for the polystyrene-MINTs samples with an optimized loading of just\n0.01 wt.%, while the supramolecular models with identical chemical composition\nand loading showed negligible or even detrimental influence. This behavior is\nfound for three different types of SWNTs and two types of macrocycles.\nMolecular dynamics simulations show that the polymer adopts an elongated\nconformation parallel to the SWNT when interacting with MINT fillers,\nirrespective of the macrocycle chemical nature, whereas a more globular\nstructure is taken upon facing with either pristine SWNTs or supramolecular\nmodels. The MINT composite architecture thus leads to a more efficient\nexploitation of the axial properties of the SWNTs and of the polymer chain at\nthe interface, in agreement with experimental results. Our findings demonstrate\nthat the mechanical bond imparts distinctive advantageous properties to SWNT\nderivatives as polymer fillers.\n", "  Stellar radiation from X-rays to the visible provides the energy that\ncontrols the photochemistry and mass loss from exoplanet atmospheres. The\nimportant extreme ultraviolet (EUV) region (10--91.2~nm) is inaccessible and\nshould be computed from a reliable stellar model. It is essential to understand\nthe formation regions and physical processes responsible for the various\nstellar emission features in order to predict how the spectral energy\ndistribution varies with age and activity levels. We compute a state-of-the-art\nsemi-empirical atmospheric model and the emergent high-resolution synthetic\nspectrum of the moderately active M2~V star GJ~832 as the first of a series of\nmodels for stars with different activity levels. Using non-LTE radiative\ntransfer techniques and including many molecular lines, we construct a\none-dimensional simple model for the physical structure of the star's\nchromosphere, chromosphere-corona transition region, and corona. The\nsynthesized spectrum for this model fits the continuum and lines across the UV\nto optical spectrum. Particular emphasis is given to the emission lines at\nwavelengths shorter than 300~nm observed with {\\em HST}, which have important\neffects on the photochemistry in the exoplanet atmospheres. The FUV line ratios\nindicate that the transition region of GJ~832 is more biased to hotter material\nthan that of the quiet Sun. The excellent agreement of our computed EUV\nluminosity with that obtained by two other techniques indicates that our model\npredicts reliable EUV emission from GJ~832. We find that unobserved EUV flux of\nGJ~832, which heats the outer atmospheres of exoplanets and drives their mass\nloss, is comparable to the active Sun.\n", "  We study a model of massive photons with a parity invariant and non-local\nmass term. We identify a discrete symmetry of the classical equations of motion\nand show that this symmetry can be thought of as an electric-magnetic duality\nvalid only in the presence of a non-zero photon mass. We explore this duality\nand discuss some features of the theory. We define notions of electric and\nmagnetic charge that can be computed in any spatial domain as a volume integral\nof a density. These integrals can be transformed into integrals on the\nboundary. For instance, the electric charge is given by the sum of the electric\nflux through the boundary of the domain and a line integral of the dual gauge\nfield along that same boundary. We show that electric and magnetic charge is\nquantized $q_mq_e = 2\\pi n m_\\gamma/e^2$, where $e$ is the coupling constant\nand $m_\\gamma$ is the mass of the photon. Classical field configurations\nassociated with external electric and magnetic charges as well as the classical\nforces between electric and magnetic charges are computed.\n", "  One of the most fundamental problems in science is to define {\\it\nquantitatively} the complexity of organized matters, i.e., {\\it organized\ncomplexity}. Although many measures have been proposed toward this aim in\nprevious decades, there is no agreed upon definition. This paper presents a new\nquantitative definition of organized complexity. This definition {\\it\nsimultaneously} captures the three major features of complexity: computational\n(similar to logical depth), descriptional (similar to the Kolmogorov complexity\nand effective complexity) and distributional (similar to statistical\ncomplexity). In addition, the proposed definition is computable and can measure\nboth probabilistic and deterministic forms of objects in a unified manner. The\nproposed definition is based on circuits rather than Turing machines and\n$\\epsilon$-machines. We give several criteria required for organized complexity\nmeasures and show that the proposed definition satisfies all of them for the\nfirst time. We then apply this quantitative definition to formulate a {\\it\nsemantic information theory}. We present the first formal definition of a {\\it\nsemantic information amount}, which is the core concept of the semantic\ninformation theory, that is based only on concretely defined notions. Previous\nsemantic information theories defined this amount under some a priori\ninformation which is not concretely specified. We then unveil several\nfundamental properties in the semantic information theory, e.g., a semantic\nsource coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and effectiveness\ncoding theorem. Although the semantic information theory has a long history of\nresearch going back more than six decades, there has been no study on its\nrelation to organized complexity. This paper offers the first unified paradigm\nof organized complexity and semantic information theory.\n", "  A global disk oscillation implemented in the viscous decretion disk (VDD)\nmodel has been used to reproduce most of the observed properties of the well\nknown Be star $\\zeta$ Tau. 48 Librae shares several similarities with $\\zeta$\nTau -- they are both early-type Be stars, they display shell characteristics in\ntheir spectra, and they exhibit cyclic $V/R$ variations -- but has some marked\ndifferences as well, such as a much denser and more extended disk, a much\nlonger $V/R$ cycle, and the absence of the so-called triple-peak features. We\naim to reproduce the photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observables\nof 48 Librae with a self-consistent model, and to test the global oscillation\nscenario for this target. Our calculations are carried out with the\nthree-dimensional NLTE radiative transfer code HDUST. We employ a rotationally\ndeformed, gravity-darkened central star, surrounded by a disk whose unperturbed\nstate is given by the VDD model. A two-dimensional global oscillation code is\nthen used to calculate the disk perturbation, and superimpose it on the\nunperturbed disk. A very good, self-consistent fit to the time-averaged\nproperties of the disk is obtained with the VDD. The calculated perturbation\nhas a period $P = 12$ yr, which agrees with the observed period, and the\nbehaviour of the $V/R$ cycle is well reproduced by the perturbed model. The\nperturbed model improves the fit to the photometric data and reproduces some\nfeatures of the observed spectroscopic data. Some suggestions to improve the\nsynthesized spectroscopy in a future work are given.\n", "  C2CNT (Carbon dioxide to carbon nanotube) cement plants have been introduced\nand analyzed which provide a significant economic incentive to eliminate the\nmassive CO2 greenhouse gas emissions of current plants and serves as a template\nfor carbon mitigation in other industrial manufacturing processes. Rather than\nregarding CO2 as a costly pollutant, this is accomplished by treating CO2 as a\nfeedstock resource to generate valuable products (carbon nanotubes). The\nexhaust from partial and full oxy-fuel cement plant configurations are coupled\nto the inlet of a C2CNT chamber in which CO2 is transformed by electrolysis in\na molten carbonate electrolyte at a steel cathode and a nickel anode. In this\nhigh yield 4e- per CO2 process, the CO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes at\nthe cathode, and pure oxygen at the anode that is looped back in improving the\ncement line energy efficiency and rate of production. A partial oxy-fuel\nprocess looping the pure oxygen back in through the plant calcinator has been\ncompared to a full oxy-fuel process in which it is looped back in through the\nplant kiln. The second provides the advantage of easier retrofit, while the\nfirst maximizes efficiency by minimizing the volume of gas throughput\n(eliminating N2 from air). An upper limit to the electrical cost to drive C2CNT\nelectrolysis is USD70 based on Texas wind power costs, but will be lower with\nfuel expenses when oxy-fuel plant energy improvements are taken account. The\ncurrent value of a ton of carbon nanotubes is substantially in excess of a ton\nof cement. Hence a C2CNT cement plant consumes USD50 of electricity, emits no\nCO2, and produces USD100 of cement and USD60,000 of carbon nanotubes per ton of\nCO2 avoided. As the cement product ages, CO2 is spontaneously absorbed. This is\na powerful economic incentive, rather than economic cost, to mitigate climate\nchange through a carbon negative process.\n", "  The particle diffusion in a fluid is a classical topic that dates back to\nmore than one century ago. However, a full solution to this issue still lacks.\nIn this work the velocity autocorrelation function and the diffusion constant\nare derived analytically, and the hydrodynamics effect on the particle\ndiffusion is analyzed in detail. Unlike previous studies, the ring-collision\neffect is exhaustively considered in our treatment, and the hydrodynamics\napproach is extended to the whole time range. Large scale molecular dynamics\nsimulations for the hard-disk fluid show that our analytical results are valid\nup to the density close to the crystallization point.\n", "  We continue the development of $\\mathbb{Z}^n_2$-supergeometry, a natural\ngeneralization of classical ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded) supergeometry, by proving\nthe Frobenius theorem for integrable distributions on differentiable\n$\\mathbb{Z}^n_2$-supermanifolds. Both the local and global versions of the\ntheorem are addressed.\n"]}
