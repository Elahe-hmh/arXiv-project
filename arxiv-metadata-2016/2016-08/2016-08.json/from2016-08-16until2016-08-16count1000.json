hierarchies in $d$\ndimensions, for focusing and defocusing interactions. We introduce new higher\norder energy functionals and prove that they are conserved for solutions of\nenergy subcritical defocusing, and $L^2$ subcritical (de)focusing GP\nhierarchies, in spaces also used by Erd\\\"os, Schlein and Yau in\n\\cite{esy1,esy2}. By use of this tool, we prove a priori $H^1$ bounds for\npositive semidefinite solutions in those spaces. Moreover, we obtain global\nwell-posedness results for positive semidefinite solutions in the spaces\nstudied in the works of Klainerman and Machedon, \\cite{klma}, and in\n\\cite{chpa2}. As part of our analysis, we prove generalizations of Sobolev and\nGagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities for density matrices.\n", "  We present a new particle module of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Piernik\ncode. The original multi-fluid grid code based on the Relaxing Total Variation\nDiminishing (RTVD) scheme has been extended by addition of dust described\nwithin the particle approximation. The dust is now described as a system of\ninteracting particles. The particles can interact with gas, which is described\nas a fluid. In this poster we introduce the scheme used to solve equations of\nmotion for the particles and present the first results coming from the module.\nThe results of test problems are also compared with the results coming from\nfluid simulations made with Piernik-MHD code. The comparison shows the most\nimportant differences between fluid and particle approximations used to\ndescribe dynamical evolution of dust under astrophysical conditions.\n", "  This article consists of two parts. In the first part, we review the most\nrecent proofs establishing quadratic Morawetz inequalities for the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLS). We also describe the applications of these\nestimates to the problem of quantum scattering. In the second part, we\ngeneralize some of the methods developed for the NLS by many authors to the\ncase of Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchies. In particular, we prove both regular\nand interaction Morawetz identities for the GP hierarchy, which appear here for\nthe first time in the literature.\n", "  This is the first of three papers on Conformal General Relativity (CGR),\nwhich differs from Einstein's General Relativity (GR) in that it requires\naction--integral invariance under local scale transformations in addition to\ngeneral coordinate transformations. The theory is here introduced in the\nsemiclassical approximation as a preliminary approach to a quantum theoretical\nimplementation. The idea of a conformal--invariant extension of GR was\nintroduced by Weyl in 1919. For several decades it had little impact, as CGR\nimplies that all fields are massless. Today this does not appear to be an\nunsurmountable difficulty since nonzero mass parameters may result from the\nspontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry. The theory leads to very\ninteresting results and predictions: 1) the spontaneous breakdown of conformal\nsymmetry is only possible in a 4D--spacetime with small negative curvature; 2)\nCGR requires the introduction of a ghost scalar field $\\sigma(x)$ invested with\ngeometric meaning and a physical scalar field $\\varphi(x)$ of zero mass, both\nof which have nonzero vacuum expectation values; 3) in order to preserve\n$S$--matrix unitarity, $\\sigma(x)$ and $\\varphi(x)$ must interact in such a way\nthat the total energy density is bounded from below; 4) this interaction makes\n$\\varphi(x)$ behave like a Higgs field of varying mass, which is capable of\npromoting a huge energy transfer from geometry to matter identifiable as the\nbig bang; 5) in the course of time, the Higgs boson mass becomes a constant and\nCGR converges to GR.\n", "  The interaction of neutrinos with gravitational fields in the weak field\nregime at one loop to the leading order has been studied by Menon and\nThalappilil. They deduced some theoretical differences between the Majorana and\nDirac neutrinos. Then they proved that, in spite of these theoretical\ndifferences, as far as experiments are concerned, they would be virtually\nindistinguishable. We study the interaction of neutrinos with weak\ngravitational fields to the second order (at two loops). We show that there\nappear new neutrino gravitational form factors which were absent in the\nfirst-order calculations, so from a theoretical point of view there are more\ndifferences between the two kinds of neutrinos than in the first order, but we\nshow that likewise they are indistinguishable experimentally.\n", "  The dual symmetry between electric and magnetic fields is an important\nintrinsic property of Maxwell equations in free space. This symmetry underlies\nthe conservation of optical helicity, and, as we show here, is closely related\nto the separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of light (the helicity\nflux coincides with the spin angular momentum). However, in the standard\nfield-theory formulation of electromagnetism, the field Lagrangian is not dual\nsymmetric. This leads to problematic dual-asymmetric forms of the canonical\nenergy-momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum tensors. Moreover, we show\nthat the components of these tensors conflict with the helicity and energy\nconservation laws. To resolve this discrepancy between the symmetries of the\nLagrangian and Maxwell equations, we put forward a dual-symmetric Lagrangian\nformulation of classical electromagnetism. This dual electromagnetism preserves\nthe form of Maxwell equations, yields meaningful canonical energy-momentum and\nangular momentum tensors, and ensures a self-consistent separation of the spin\nand orbital degrees of freedom. This provides rigorous derivation of results\nsuggested in other recent approaches. We make the Noether analysis of the dual\nsymmetry and all the Poincar\\'e symmetries, examine both local and integral\nconserved quantities, and show that only the dual electromagnetism naturally\nproduces a complete self-consistent set of conservation laws. We also discuss\nthe observability of physical quantities distinguishing the standard and dual\ntheories, as well as relations to quantum weak measurements and various optical\nexperiments.\n", "  Four independent dimension-eight operators give rise to anomalous neutral\ntriple gauge boson interactions, one CP-even and three CP-odd. Only the CP-even\noperator interferes with the Standard Model for the production of a pair of\non-shell neutral bosons. However, the effects are found to be tiny due mainly\nto the mismatch of the Z boson polarization between the productions from the SM\nand the new operator.\n", "  A visualization scheme for dynamics of a qudit polarization vector in a\ntime-dependent magnetic field is presented by solving equations for a density\nmatrix in Hermitian basis. This is realized by means of mapping solution for\nthe polarization vector on the three-dimensional spherical curve (vector\nhodograph).\n  The obtained results obviously display the interference of precessional and\nnutational effects on the polarization vector in a magnetic resonance. The\nstudy can find the practical applications in a magnetic resonance and 3D\nvisualization of computational data.\n", "  Self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) have been proposed in\nvarious astrophysical contexts, including Bose-stars and BEC dark matter halos.\nThese systems are described by a combination of the Gross-Pitaevskii and\nPoisson equations (the GPP system). In the analysis of these hypothetical\nobjects, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) approximation is widely used. This approximation\nis based on the assumption that in the presence of a large number of particles,\nthe kinetic term in the Gross-Pitaevskii energy functional can be neglected,\nyet it is well known that this assumption is violated near the condensate\nsurface. We also show that the total energy of the self-gravitating condensate\nin the TF-approximation is positive. The stability of a self-gravitating system\nis dependent on the total energy being negative. Therefore, the\nTF-approximation is ill suited to formulate initial conditions in numerical\nsimulations. As an alternative, we offer an approximate solution of the full\nGPP system.\n", "  We give a pragmatic/pedagogical discussion of using Euclidean path integral\nin asset pricing. We then illustrate the path integral approach on short-rate\nmodels. By understanding the change of path integral measure in the\nVasicek/Hull-White model, we can apply the same techniques to \"less-tractable\"\nmodels such as the Black-Karasinski model. We give explicit formulas for\ncomputing the bond pricing function in such models in the analog of quantum\nmechanical \"semiclassical\" approximation. We also outline how to apply\nperturbative quantum mechanical techniques beyond the \"semiclassical\"\napproximation, which are facilitated by Feynman diagrams.\n", "  A longstanding mystery in understanding cuprate superconductors is the\ninconsistency between the experimental data measured by scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In\nparticular, the gap between prominent side peaks observed in STS is much bigger\nthan the superconducting gap observed by ARPES measurements. Here, we reconcile\nthe two experimental techniques by generalising a theory which was previously\napplied to zero-dimensional mesoscopic Kondo systems to strongly correlated\ntwo-dimensional (2D) exotic superconductors. We show that the side peaks\nobserved in tunneling conductance measurements in all these materials have a\nuniversal origin: They are formed by coherence-mediated tunneling under bias\nand do not directly reflect the underlying density of states (DOS) of the\nsample. We obtain theoretical predictions of the tunneling conductance and the\ndensity of states of the sample simultaneously and show that for cuprate and\npnictide superconductors, the extracted sample DOS is consistent with the\nsuperconducting gap measured by ARPES.\n", "  Numerical models of the geodynamo are usually classified in two categories:\nthose denominated dipolar modes, observed when the inertial term is small\nenough, and multipolar fluctuating dynamos, for stronger forcing. We show that\na third dynamo branch corresponding to a dominant force balance between the\nCoriolis force and the Lorentz force can be produced numerically. This force\nbalance is usually referred to as the strong-field limit. This solution\nco-exists with the often described viscous branch. Direct numerical simulations\nexhibit a transition from a weak-field dynamo branch, in which viscous effects\nset the dominant length scale, and the strong-field branch in which viscous and\ninertial effects are largely negligible. These results indicate that a\ndistinguished limit needs to be sought to produce numerical models relevant to\nthe geodynamo and that the usual approach of minimizing the magnetic Prandtl\nnumber (ratio of the fluid kinematic viscosity to its magnetic diffusivity) at\na given Ekman number is misleading.\n", "  It has been shown that a noncommutative-geometry background may be able to\nsupport traversable wormholes. This paper discusses the possible detection of\nsuch wormholes in the outer regions of galactic halos by means of gravitational\nlensing. The procedure allows a comparison to other models such as the\nNavarro-Frenk-White model and f(R) modified gravity and is likely to favor a\nmodel based on noncommutative geometry.\n", "  In this paper, we study the interplay between the epidemic spreading and the\ndiffusion of awareness in multiplex networks. In the model, an infectious\ndisease can spread in one network representing the paths of epidemic spreading\n(contact network), leading to the diffusion of awareness in the other network\n(information network), and then the diffusion of awareness will cause\nindividuals to take social distances, which in turn affects the epidemic\nspreading. As for the diffusion of awareness, we assume that, on the one hand,\nindividuals can be informed by other aware neighbors in information network, on\nthe other hand, the susceptible individuals can be self-awareness induced by\nthe infected neighbors in the contact networks (local information) or mass\nmedia (global information). Through Markov chain approach and numerical\ncomputations, we find that the density of infected individuals and the epidemic\nthreshold can be affected by the structures of the two networks and the\neffective transmission rate of the awareness. However, we prove that though the\nintroduction of the self-awareness can lower the density of infection, which\ncannot increase the epidemic threshold no matter of the local information or\nglobal information. Our finding is remarkably different to many previous\nresults--local information based behavioral response can alter the epidemic\nthreshold.\n", "  We give a unified approach to localization of maximally symmetric gauge\ntheories on spheres, including $S^6$ and $S^7$. The approach follows Pestun's\nmethod of dimensionally reducing from 10 dimensional super Yang-Mills. The\nresulting theories have a reduced $R$-symmetry which includes an $SU(1,1)$\nsubgroup, except in four dimensions where, because of conformal invariance, the\nfull flat-space $R$-symmetry is maintained, and in seven dimensions where\n$SU(1,1)$ is the flat-space $R$-symmetry. For the case of $S^6$ and $S^7$ we\ndiscuss the localization of these theories and also present new results for the\ncorresponding matrix models. The matrix models for $S^6$ and $S^7$ are\nqualitatively similar to the matrix models of a vector multiplet on $S^4$ and\n$S^5$ respectively. We also discuss the contributions of instantons in the six\nand seven dimensional cases.\n", "  Adopting the notation of Teukolsky and Press, we derive the connection\nrelation for asymptotic solutions of the massless Dirac equation on a Kerr\nbackground. We show that, unlike bosonic fields, the connection relation for\nmassless Dirac fields (neutrino) provides a rigorous proof of mode stability.\nThe same relation also implies that every incoming mode can be absorbed by the\nblack hole or there is no superradiance. Recent works on overspinning black\nholes have shown that this can lead to the formation of naked singularities. We\nargue that the fact that both the mode stability of the black hole under\nneutrino perturbations and the instability of the event horizon (therefore the\ninstability of the black hole) can be derived from the same connection relation\nleads to a paradox. In other words mode, stability implies event horizon\ninstability as far as neutrino perturbations are concerned.\n", "  We introduce and study q-randomized Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK)\ncorrespondences which interpolate between the classical (q=0) and geometric\n(q->1) RSK correspondences (the latter ones are sometimes also called\ntropical).\n  For 0<q<1 our correspondences are randomized, i.e., the result of an\ninsertion is a certain probability distribution on semistandard Young tableaux.\nBecause of this randomness, we use the language of discrete time Markov\ndynamics on two-dimensional interlacing particle arrays (these arrays are in a\nnatural bijection with semistandard tableaux). Our dynamics act nicely on a\ncertain class of probability measures on arrays, namely, on q-Whittaker\nprocesses (which are t=0 versions of Macdonald processes). We present four\nMarkov dynamics which for q=0 reduce to the classical row or column RSK\ncorrespondences applied to a random input matrix with independent geometric or\nBernoulli entries.\n  Our new two-dimensional discrete time dynamics generalize and extend several\nknown constructions: (1) The discrete time q-TASEPs arise as one-dimensional\nmarginals of our \"column\" dynamics. In a similar way, our \"row\" dynamics lead\nto discrete time q-PushTASEPs - new integrable particle systems in the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. We employ these new one-dimensional\ndiscrete time systems to establish a Fredholm determinantal formula for the\ntwo-sided continuous time q-PushASEP conjectured by Corwin-Petrov (2013). (2)\nIn a certain Poisson-type limit (from discrete to continuous time), our\ntwo-dimensional dynamics reduce to the q-randomized column and row\nRobinson-Schensted correspondences introduced by O'Connell-Pei (2012) and\nBorodin-Petrov (2013), respectively. (3) In a scaling limit as q->1, two of our\nfour dynamics on interlacing arrays turn into the geometric RSK correspondences\nassociated with log-Gamma or strict-weak directed random polymers.\n", "  For a long time, practitioners of the art of operator algebras always worked\nover the complex numbers, and nobody paid much attention to real C*-algebras.\nOver the last thirty years, that situation has changed, and it's become\napparent that real C*-algebras have a lot of extra structure not evident from\ntheir complexifications. At the same time, interest in real C*-algebras has\nbeen driven by a number of compelling applications, for example in the\nclassification of manifolds of positive scalar curvature, in representation\ntheory, and in the study of orientifold string theories. We will discuss a\nnumber of interesting examples of these, and how the real Baum-Connes\nconjecture plays an important role.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a new evolve-then-filter reduced order model\n(EF-ROM). This is a regularized ROM (Reg-ROM), which aims at the numerical\nstabilization of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) ROMs for\nconvection-dominated flows. We also consider the Leray ROM (L-ROM). These two\nReg-ROMs use explicit ROM spatial filtering to smooth (regularize) various\nterms in the ROMs. Two spatial filters are used: a POD projection onto a POD\nsubspace (Proj) and a new POD differential filter (DF). The four Reg-ROM/filter\ncombinations are tested in the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional\nflow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number $Re=1000$. Overall, the most\naccurate Reg-ROM/filter combination is EF-ROM-DF. Furthermore, the spatial\nfilter has a higher impact on the Reg-ROM than the regularization used. Indeed,\nthe DF generally yields better results than Proj for both the EF-ROM and L-ROM.\nFinally, the CPU times of the four Reg-ROM/filter combinations are orders of\nmagnitude lower than the CPU time of the DNS.\n", "  We show that there exists a representation of a matrix valued gauge field via\nintrinsic \"BRST\" operator assigned to matrix valued generators of a gauge\nalgebra. In this way, we reproduce the standard formulation of the ordinary\nYang - Mills theory. In the case of a generating quasigroup/groupoid, we give a\nnatural counterpart to the Yang - Mills action. The latter counterpart does\nalso apply as to the most general case of an involution for matrix-valued gauge\ngenerators.\n", "  Inspired by the present experimental status of charged charmonium-like states\n$Z_c^+$, the tetraquark states $[cu][\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ are systematically\nstudied in a color flux-tube model with a multi-body confinement potential. The\ninvestigation indicates that charged charmonium-like states $Z_c^+(3900)$ or\n$Z_c^+(3885)$, $Z_c^+(3930)$, $Z_c^+(4020)$ or $Z_c^+(4025)$, $Z_1^+(4050)$,\n$Z_2^+(4250)$, and $Z_c^+(4200)$ can be uniformly described as tetraquark\nstates $[cu][\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ with the quantum numbers $n^{2S+1}L_J$ and $J^P$\nof $1^{3}S_1$ and $1^+$, $2^{3}S_1$ and $1^+$, $1^5S_2$ and $2^+$, $1^3P_1$ and\n$1^-$, $1^5D_1$ and $1^+$, and $1^3D_1$ and $1^+$, respectively. The predicted\nlowest charged tetraquark state $[cu][\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ with $0^+$ and $1^1S_0$\nhas a energy of $3780\\pm10$ MeV in the model. The tetraquark states are compact\nthree-dimensional spatial configurations similar to a rugby ball, the higher\norbital angular momentum $L$ between the diquark $[cu]$ and antidiquark\n$[\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$, the more prolate of the states. The multibody color\nflux-tube, a collective degree of freedom, plays an important role in the\nformation of those charge tetraquark states. However, the two heavier charged\nstates $Z^+_c(4430)$ and $Z^+_c(4475)$ can not be explained as tetraquark\nstates $[cu][\\bar{c}\\bar{d}]$ in this model approach.\n", "  The resonant-state expansion (RSE) Born approximation, a rigorous\nperturbative method developed for electrodynamic and quantum mechanical open\nsystems, is further developed to treat waveguides with a Sellmeier dispersion.\nFor media that can be described by these types of dispersion over the relevant\nfrequency range, such as optical glass, I show that the perturbed RSE problem\ncan be solved by diagonalizing a second-order eigenvalue problem. In the case\nof a single resonance at zero frequency, this is simplified to a generalized\neigenvalue problem. Results are presented using analytically solvable planar\nwaveguides and parameters of borosilicate BK7 glass, for a perturbation in the\nwaveguide width. The efficiency of using either an exact dispersion over all\nfrequencies or an approximate dispersion over a narrow frequency range is\ncompared. I included a derivation of the RSE Born approximation for waveguides\nto make use of the resonances calculated by the RSE, an RSE extension of the\nwell-known Born approximation.\n", "  The aim of this work is to outline in some detail the use of combinatorial\nalgebra in planar quantum field theory. Particular emphasis is given to the\nrelations between the different types of planar Green's functions. The key\nobject is a Hopf algebra which is naturally defined on non-commuting sources,\nand the fact that its genuine unshuffle coproduct splits into left- and right\nunshuffle half-coproduts. The latter give rise to the notion of unshuffle\nbialgebra. This setting allows to describe the relation between planar full and\nconnected Green's functions by solving a simple linear fixed point equation. A\nmodification of this linear fixed point equation gives rise to the relation\nbetween planar connected and one-particle irreducible Green's functions. The\ngraphical calculus that arises from this approach also leads to a new\nunderstanding of functional calculus in planar QFT, whose rules for\ndifferentiation with respect to non-commuting sources can be translated into\nthe language of growth operations on planar rooted trees. We also include a\nbrief outline of our approach in the framework of non-planar theories.\n", "  We analyze radiative processes of a quantum system composed by two identical\ntwo-level atoms interacting with a massless scalar field prepared in the vacuum\nstate in the presence of perfect reflecting flat mirrors. We consider that the\natoms are prepared in a stationary maximally entangled state. We investigate\nthe spontaneous transitions rates from the entangled states to the collective\nground state induced by vacuum fluctuations. In the empty-space case, the\nspontaneous decay rates can be enhanced or inhibited depending on the specific\nentangled state and changes with the distance between the atoms. Next, we\nconsider the presence of perfect mirrors and impose Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on such surfaces. In the presence of a single mirror the transition\nrate for the symmetric state undergoes a slight reduction, whereas for the\nantisymmetric state our results indicate a slightly enhancement. Finally, we\ninvestigate the effect of multiple reflections by two perfect mirrors on the\ntransition rates.\n", "  In MSSM scenarios where the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle\n(LSP), and therefore a viable dark matter candidate, the stop $\\tilde{t}_1$\ncould be the next-to-lightest superpartner (NLSP). For a mass spectrum\nsatisfying: $m_{\\widetilde{G}}+m_t>m_{\\tilde{t}_1}>m_{\\widetilde{G}}+m_b+m_W$,\nthe stop decay is dominated by the 3-body mode $\\tilde{t}_1\\rightarrow\nb\\,W\\,\\tilde{G}$. We calculate the stop life-time, including the full\ncontributions from top, sbottom and chargino as intermediate states. We also\nevaluate the stop lifetime for the case when the gravitino can be approximated\nby the goldstino state. Our analytical results are conveniently expressed using\nan expansion in terms of the intermediate state mass, which helps to identify\nthe massless limit.\n  In the region of low gravitino mass ($m_{\\widetilde{G}}\\ll m_{\\tilde{t}_1}$)\nthe results obtained using the gravitino and goldstino cases turns out to be\nsimilar, as expected. However for higher gravitino masses $m_{\\widetilde{G}}\n\\lesssim m_{\\tilde{t}_1}$ the results for the lifetime could show a difference\nof O(100)\\%.\n", "  Ultracold atomic systems offer a unique tool for understanding behavior of\nmatter in the quantum degenerate regime, promising studies of a vast range of\nphenomena covering many disciplines from condensed matter to quantum\ninformation and particle physics. Coupling these systems to quantized light\nfields opens further possibilities of observing delicate effects typical of\nquantum optics in the context of strongly correlated systems. Measurement\nbackaction is one of the most fundamental manifestations of quantum mechanics\nand it is at the core of many famous quantum optics experiments. Here we show\nthat quantum backaction of weak measurement can be used for tailoring\nlong-range correlations of ultracold fermions, realizing quantum states with\nspatial modulations of the density and magnetization, thus overcoming usual\nrequirement for a strong interatomic interactions. We propose detection schemes\nfor implementing antiferromagnetic states and density waves. We demonstrate\nthat such long-range correlations cannot be realized with local addressing, and\nthey are a consequence of the competition between global but spatially\nstructured backaction of weak quantum measurement and unitary dynamics of\nfermions.\n", "  Collective organization in matter plays a significant role in its expressed\nphysical properties. Typically, it is detected via an order parameter,\nappropriately defined for each given system's observed emergent patterns.\nRecent developments in information theory, however, suggest quantifying\ncollective organization in a system- and phenomenon-agnostic way: decompose the\nsystem's thermodynamic entropy density into a localized entropy, that solely\ncontained in the dynamics at a single location, and a bound entropy, that\nstored in space as domains, clusters, excitations, or other emergent\nstructures. We compute this decomposition and related quantities explicitly for\nthe nearest-neighbor Ising model on the 1D chain, the Bethe lattice with\ncoordination number k=3, and the 2D square lattice, illustrating its generality\nand the functional insights it gives near and away from phase transitions. In\nparticular, we consider the roles that different spin motifs play (in cluster\nbulk, cluster edges, and the like) and how these affect the dependencies\nbetween spins.\n", "  The vacuum structure of the inert doublet model is analysed at the one-loop\nlevel using the effective potential formalism, to verify the validity of\ntree-level predictions for the properties of the global minimum. An inert\nminimum (with massive fermions) and an inert-like minimum (with massless\nfermions) can coexist at tree level. But the one-loop analysis reveals that the\nallowed parameter space for the coexistence of more than one minimum is larger\nthan the tree-level expected one. It is also shown that for some choices of\nparameters, the global minimum found at the one-loop level may be inert (or\ninert-like), contrary to what the tree-level analysis indicates.\n", "  We study the system of double Rashba wires brought into the proximity to an\n$s$-wave superconductor. The time reversal invariant topological\nsuperconductivity is realized if the interwire pairing corresponding to crossed\nAndreev reflection dominates over the standard intrawire pairing. We derive the\ntopological criterion and show that the system hosts zero energy Andreev bound\nstates such as a Kramers pair of Majorana fermions. We classify symmetry of the\nCooper pairs focusing on the four degrees of freedom, $i.e.$, frequency, spin,\nspatial parity inside wires, and spatial parity between wires. The magnitude of\nthe odd-frequency pairing is strongly enhanced in the topological state. We\nalso explore properties of junctions occurring in such double wire systems. If\none section of the junction is in the topological state and the other is in the\ntrivial state, the energy dispersion of Andreev bound states is proportional to\n$\\sim\\pm\\sin\\varphi$, where $\\varphi$ denotes the macroscopic phase difference\nbetween two sections. This behavior can be intuitively explained by the\ncouplings of a Kramers pair of Majorana fermions and spin-singlet $s$-wave\nCooper pair and can also be understood by analyzing an effective continuum\nmodel of the $s+p$/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid system.\n", "  We present a catalog of 11 multi-planet systems from Campaigns 1 and 2 of the\nK2 mission. We report the sizes and orbits of 26 planets split between seven\n2-planet systems and four 3-planet systems. These planets stem from a\nsystematic search of the K2 photometry for all dwarf stars observed by K2 in\nthese fields. We precisely characterized the host stars with adaptive optics\nimaging and analysis of high-resolution optical spectra from Keck/HIRES and\nmedium-resolution spectra from IRTF/SpeX. We confirm two planet candidates by\nmass detection and validate the remaining 24 candidates to $>99\\%$ confidence.\nThirteen planets were previously validated or confirmed by other studies and 24\nwere previously identified as planet candidates. The planets are mostly smaller\nthan Neptune (21/26 planets) as in the Kepler mission and all have short\nperiods ($P < 50$ d) due to the duration of the K2 photometry. The host stars\nare relatively bright (most have $Kp < 12.5$ mag) and are amenable to follow-up\ncharacterization. For K2-38, we measured precise radial velocities using\nKeck/HIRES and provide initial estimates of the planet masses. K2-38b is a\nshort-period super-Earth with a radius of $1.55 \\pm 0.16~R_\\oplus$, a mass of\n$12.0 \\pm 2.9~M_\\oplus$, and a high density consistent with an iron-rich\ncomposition. The outer planet K2-38c is a lower density sub-Neptune-size planet\nwith a radius of $2.42 \\pm 0.29~R_\\oplus$ and a mass of $9.9 \\pm 4.6~M_\\oplus$\nthat likely has a substantial envelope. This new planet sample demonstrates the\ncapability of K2 to discover numerous planetary systems around bright stars.\n", "  Turbulent-laminar patterns are ubiquitous near transition in wall-bounded\nshear flows. Despite recent progress in describing their dynamics in analogy to\nnon-equilibrium phase transitions, there is no theory explaining their\nemergence. Dynamical-system approaches suggest that invariant solutions to the\nNavier--Stokes equations, such as traveling waves and relative periodic orbits\nin pipe flow, act as building blocks of the disordered dynamics. While recent\nstudies have shown how transient chaos arises from such solutions, the ensuing\ndynamics lacks the strong fluctuations in size, shape and speed of the\nturbulent spots observed in experiments. We here show that chaotic spots with\ndistinct dynamical and kinematic properties merge in phase space and give rise\nto the enhanced spatio-temporal patterns observed in pipe flow. This paves the\nway for a dynamical-system foundation to the phenomenology of turbulent-laminar\npatterns in wall-bounded extended shear flows.\n", "  In the optomechanical cooling of a dispersively coupled oscillator, it is\nonly possible to reach the oscillator ground state in the resolved sideband\nregime, where the cavity-mode line width is smaller than the resonant frequency\nof the mechanical oscillator being cooled. In this paper, we show that the\ndispersively coupled system can be cooled to the ground state in the unresolved\nsideband regime using an ancillary oscillator, which is coupled to the same\noptical mode via dissipative interaction. The ancillary oscillator has a\nresonant frequency close to that of the target oscillator; thus, the ancillary\noscillator is also in the unresolved sideband regime. We require only a single\nblue-detuned laser mode to drive the cavity.\n", "  We demonstrate how a Dirac-like magnon spectrum is generated for localized\nmagnetic moments forming a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. The Dirac\ncrossing point is proven to be robust against magnon-magnon interactions, as\nthese only shift the spectrum. Local defects induce impurity resonances near\nthe Dirac point, as well as magnon Friedel oscillations. The energy of the\nDirac point is controlled by the exchange coupling, and thus a two-dimensional\narray of magnetic dots is an experimentally feasible realization of Dirac\nmagnons with tunable dispersion.\n", "  The asymptotic form of Dirac spinors in the field of the Reissner-Nordstrom\nblack hole are derived for the scattering states (with $E>mc^2$) obtaining the\nphase shifts of the partial wave analysis of Dirac fermions scattered from\ncharged black holes. The elastic scattering and absorption are studied giving\nanalytic formulas for the partial amplitudes and cross sections. A graphical\nstudy is performed for analysing the differential cross section\n(forward/backward scattering) and the polarization degree as functions of\nscattering angle.\n", "  An important fact in studying the link prediction is that the structural\nproperties of networks have significant impacts on the performance of\nalgorithms. Therefore, how to improve the performance of link prediction with\nthe aid of structural properties of networks is an essential problem. By\nanalyzing many real networks, we find a common structure property: nodes are\npreferentially linked to the nodes with the weak clique structure (abbreviated\nas PWCS to simplify descriptions). Based on this PWCS phenomenon, we propose a\nlocal friend recommendation (FR) index to facilitate link prediction. Our\nexperiments show that the performance of FR index is generally better than some\nfamous local similarity indices, such as Common Neighbor (CN) index,\nAdamic-Adar (AA) index and Resource Allocation (RA) index. We then explain why\nPWCS can give rise to the better performance of FR index in link prediction.\nFinally, a mixed friend recommendation index (labelled MFR) is proposed by\nutilizing the PWCS phenomenon, which further improves the accuracy of link\nprediction.\n", "  We consider the motion of test particles and light rays in a static\ncylindrically symmetric conformal spacetime given by Said et al [1]. We derive\nthe equations of motion and present their analytical solutions in terms of the\nWeierstrass {\\wp} function and the Kleinian {\\sigma} function. Using parametric\ndiagrams and effective potentials we analyze the possible orbits and\ncharacterize them in terms of the energy and the angular momentum of the test\nparticles. Finally we show some examples of orbits.\n", "  We study the topological properties of elementary excitations in a staggered\n$p_x \\pm i p_y$ Bose-Einstein condensate realized in recent orbital optical\nlattice experiments. The condensate wave function may be viewed as a\nconfiguration space variant of the famous $p_x+ ip_y$ momentum space order\nparameter of strontium ruthenate superconductors. We show that its elementary\nexcitation spectrum possesses Dirac bosons with $\\pi$ Berry flux. Remarkably,\nif we induce a population imbalance between the $p_x+ip_y$ and $p_x-ip_y$\ncondensate components, a gap opens up in the excitation spectrum resulting in a\nnonzero Chern invariant and topologically protected edge excitation modes. We\ngive a detailed description on how our proposal can be implemented with\nstandard experimental technology.\n", "  In the setup of ghost condensation model the generalized second law of black\nhole thermodynamics can be respected under a radiatively stable assumption that\ncouplings between the field responsible for ghost condensate and matter fields\nsuch as those in the Standard Model are suppressed by the Planck scale. Since\nnot only black holes but also cosmology are expected to play important roles\ntowards our better understanding of gravity, we consider a cosmological setup\nto test the theory of ghost condensation. In particular we shall show that the\nde Sitter entropy bound proposed by Arkani-Hamed, et.al. is satisfied if ghost\ninflation happened in the early epoch of our universe and if there remains a\ntiny positive cosmological constant in the future infinity. We then propose a\nnotion of cosmological Page time after inflation.\n", "  For the prototype diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As, there is a\nfundamental concern about the electronic states near the Fermi level, i.e.,\nwhether the Fermi level resides in a well-separated impurity band derived from\nMn doping (impurity-band model) or in the valence band that is already merged\nwith the Mn-derived impurity band (valence-band model). We investigate this\nquestion by carefully shifting the Fermi level by means of carrier\ncompensation. We use helium-ion implantation, a standard industry technology,\nto precisely compensate the hole doping of GaAs-based diluted ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors while keeping the Mn concentration constant. We monitor the\nchange of Curie temperature ($T_C$) and conductivity. For a broad range of\nsamples including (Ga,Mn)As and (Ga,Mn)(As,P) with various Mn and P\nconcentrations, we observe a smooth decrease of $T_C$ with carrier compensation\nover a wide temperature range while the conduction is changed from metallic to\ninsulating. The existence of $T_C$ below 10\\,K is also confirmed in heavily\ncompensated samples. Our experimental results are naturally explained within\nthe valence-band picture.\n", "  Superconductor proximitized one-dimensional semiconductor nanowires with\nstrong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) are at this time the most promising\ncandidates for the realization of topological quantum information processing.\nIn current experiments the SOI originates predominantly from extrinsic fields,\ninduced by finite size effects and applied gate voltages. The dependence of the\ntopological transition in these devices on microscopic details makes scaling to\na large number of devices difficult unless a material with dominant intrinsic\nbulk SOI is used. Here we show that wires made of certain ordered alloys\nInAs$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ have spin-splittings up to 20 times larger than those\nreached in pristine InSb wires. In particular, we show this for a stable\nordered CuPt-structure at $x = 0.5$, which has an inverted band ordering and\nrealizes a novel type of a topological semimetal with triple degeneracy points\nin the bulk spectrum that produce topological surface Fermi arcs.\nExperimentally achievable strains can drive this compound either into a\ntopological insulator phase, or restore the normal band ordering making the\nCuPt-ordered InAs$_{0.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$ a semiconductor with a large intrinsic\nlinear in $k$ bulk spin splitting.\n", "  The scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and the point contact\nspectroscopy represent one of the major progresses in recent heavy fermion\nresearch. Both have revealed important information on the composite nature of\nthe emergent heavy electron quasiparticles. However, a detailed and thorough\nmicroscopic understanding of the similarities and differences in the underlying\nphysical processes of these techniques is still lacking. Here we study the\nelectron transport in the normal state of the periodic Anderson lattice by\nusing the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function technique. In addition to the\nwell-known Fano interference between the conduction and f-electron channels,\nour results further reveal the effect of spatial interference between different\nspatial paths at the interface on the differential conductance and their\ninteresting interplay with the band features such as the hybridization gap and\nthe Van Hove singularity. We find that the spatial interference leads to a\nweighted average in the momentum space for the electron transport and could\ncause suppression of the electronic band features under certain circumstances.\nIn particular, it reduces the capability of probing the f-electron spectral\nweight near the edges of the hybridization gap for large interface depending on\nthe Fermi surface of the lead. Our results indicates an intrinsic inefficiency\nof the point contact spectroscopy in probing the f-electrons.\n", "  Borrowing ideas from open quantum systems, we describe a formalism to encode\nensembles of trajectories of classical stochastic dynamics in terms of\ncontinuous matrix product states (cMPSs). We show how to define in this\napproach \"biased\" or \"conditioned\" ensembles where the probability of\ntrajectories is biased from that of the natural dynamics by some condition on\ntrajectory observables. In particular, we show that the generalised Doob\ntransform which maps a conditioned process to an equivalent \"auxiliary\" or\n\"driven\" process (one where the same conditioned set of trajectories is\ngenerated by a proper stochastic dynamics) is just a gauge transformation of\nthe corresponding cMPS. We also discuss how within this framework one can\neasily prove properties of the dynamics such as trajectory ensemble equivalence\nand fluctuation theorems.\n", "  We discuss that a low-energy effective Lagrangian relying on SO(3)\n$\\rightarrow$ SO(2) is applicable for a ferrimagnet as well as a ferromagnet\nand an antiferromagnet. The analysis of the particle states shows that there\nexist not only massless modes with the dispersion relations $\\omega \\propto\n|\\bm{k}|,\\, |\\bm{k}|^2$, i.e., the so-called type-I and type-II Nambu-Goldstone\nmodes, respectively, but also gapped modes with $\\omega \\propto\nm^2+|\\bm{k}|^2$. We clarify how the coefficients of the terms with one time\nderivative and those with two time derivatives in the effective Lagrangian\ndetermine the order parameters specifying whether the system is in a\nferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic state; we stress that the\ngapped mode related to the spontaneous symmetry breaking appears only in the\nferrimagnetic system and not in the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nsystems. We also establish the power counting scheme and calculate the\nscattering amplitudes and thereby the scattering lengths between the two\nNambu-Goldstone bosons. We show that the scattering length of the gapped mode\nis finite and proportional to the gap. This characteristic property of the\ngapped NG mode can be used to discriminate it from gapped excitations which\noriginate in other mechanisms. Finally, we study the effects of the explicit\nsymmetry breaking that are given by an external magnetic field and a single-ion\nanisotropy, and show that the external magnetic fields do not have any effects\non the scattering amplitudes in all the spin systems as was known for the\nferromagnet system. In contrast, the anisotropy does affect the scattering\namplitudes, the phase shift, and the scattering length except for spin 1/2\nsystems. This result supports the possibility of the Efimov effect in spin\nsystems discussed in previous studies.\n", "  In Coulomb drag, a current flowing in one conductor can induce a voltage\nacross an adjacent conductor via the Coulomb interaction. The mechanisms\nyielding drag effects are not always understood, even though drag effects are\nsufficiently general to be seen in many low-dimensional systems. In this\nLetter, we observe Coulomb drag in a Coulomb-coupled double quantum dot\n(CC-DQD) and, through both experimental and theoretical arguments, identify\ncotunneling as essential to obtaining a correct qualitative understanding of\nthe drag behavior.\n", "  We consider the spectral response of moving diffraction gratings, in which\nthe incident light extends over a broad angular range and where the diffracted\nlight is observed from a specific angle. We show that the dispersion relation\nbetween the frequency perceived by an observer who is looking at a moving\ngrating and the incident frequency can exhibit some unique features, such as a\nflat band (i.e., a local minimum). An observer can see the light diffracted\ninto a non-specular diffraction order from a multitude of incident light rays\nand the angle of incidence of each ray is frequency-dependent, as a\nconsequence, when the grating is moving, each incident ray experiences a\nDoppler shift in frequency that depends on its angle of incidence. We find that\nremarkable features appear near a Wood anomaly where the angle of incidence,\nfor a given diffraction angle, can change very quickly with frequency. This\nmeans that light of multiple frequencies and incident from multiple angles can\nbe mixed by the motion of the grating into the same diffracted ray and their\nfrequencies can be compressed into a narrower range. The existence of a flat\nband means that a moving grating can be used as a device to increase the\nintensity of the perceived diffracted light due to spectral compression. The\nproperties of a grating in motion in sunlight can also be relevant to the study\nof naturally occurring gratings which are typically in oscillatory motion.\n", "  For topological insulators and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs),\ntheir exotic surface states are promising for fundamental condensed matter\nphysics research as well as future electronics such as low-dissipation\nelectronics and spintronics. However, the high bulk carrier density that often\ndominates the transport property is the major materials challenge, critically\nhindering our ability to study and manipulate the surface states. In this\nmanuscript, we demonstrate an alloying strategy, SnSexTe1-x, to effectively\nreduce the bulk carrier density. As long as SnSexTe1-x remains in the cubic\ncrystal structure, it is predicted to be a TCI. We show systematic decrease of\nthe bulk carrier density with the increasing Se concentration, demonstrating\nthat the alloying principle works. In addition, we map out the phase diagram of\nthe cubic to the orthorhombic structural transition as a function of the Se\nconcentration. This was made possible by studying alloy nanoplates which remain\nsingle-crystalline and is either in the cubic or the orthorhombic phase, in\ncontrast to bulk alloys that would exhibit polycrystalline grains. Lastly, we\ninvestigate systematically the ferroelectric transition associated with the\nstructural transition from the cubic to the rhombohedral phase for SnSexTe1-x.\nThis is the first ferroelectric transition study of the alloy system\nSnSexTe1-x.\n", "  Laser slowing of CaF molecules down to the capture velocity of a\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT) for molecules is achieved. Starting from a two-stage\nbuffer gas beam source, we apply frequency-broadened \"white-light\" slowing and\nobserve approximately 6x10^4 CaF molecules with velocities near 10\\,m/s. CaF is\na candidate for collisional studies in the mK regime. This work represents a\nsignificant step towards magneto-optical trapping of CaF.\n", "  When exploring new materials for their potential in (opto)electronic device\napplications, it is important to understand the role of various carrier\ninteraction and scattering processes. Research on transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has recently progressed towards the\nrealisation of working devices, which involve light-emitting diodes, nanocavity\nlasers, and single-photon emitters. In these two-dimensional atomically thin\nsemiconductors, the Coulomb interaction is known to be much stronger than in\nquantum wells of conventional semiconductors like GaAs, as witnessed by the 50\ntimes larger exciton binding energy. The question arises, whether this directly\ntranslates into equivalently faster carrier-carrier Coulomb scattering of\nexcited carriers. Here we show that a combination of ab-initio band-structure\nand many-body theory predicts carrier relaxation on a 50-fs time scale, which\nis less than an order of magnitude faster than in quantum wells. These\nscattering times compete with the recently reported sub-ps exciton\nrecombination times, thus making it harder to achieve population inversion and\nlasing.\n", "  We compare covering factors of circumnuclear dusty obscurers in radio-loud\nand radio-quiet quasars. The radio-loud quasars are represented by a sample of\nFR II quasars obtained by cross-matching a catalog of the FR II radio sources\nselected by van Velzen et al. with the SDSS DR7 catalog of quasars. Covering\nfactors of FR II quasars are compared with covering factors of the radio-quiet\nquasars matched with them in redshift, black hole mass, and Eddington-ratio. We\nfound that covering factors, proxied by the infrared-to-bolometric luminosity\nratio, are on average slightly smaller in FR II quasars than in radio-quiet\nquasars, however, this difference is statistically significant only for the\nhighest Eddington ratios. For both samples, no statistically significant\ndependence of a median covering factor on Eddington ratio, black hole mass, nor\nredshift can be claimed.\n", "  The surface of a 3D topological insulator is described by a helical electron\nstate with the electron's spin and momentum locked together. We show that in\nthe presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations the surface of a topological\ninsulator is unstable towards a superconducting state with unusual pairing,\ndubbed Amperean pairing. The key idea is that the dynamical fluctuations of a\nferromagnetic layer deposited on the surface of a topological insulator couple\nto the electrons as gauge fields. The transverse components of the magnetic\ngauge fields are unscreened and can mediate an effective interaction between\nelectrons. There is an attractive interaction between electrons with momenta in\nthe same direction which makes the pairing to be of Amperean type. We show that\nthis attractive interaction leads to a $p$-wave pairing instability of the\nFermi surface in the Cooper channel.\n", "  Spectroscopic observations of solar flares provide critical diagnostics of\nthe physical conditions in the flaring atmosphere. Some key features in\nobserved spectra have not yet been accounted for in existing flare models. Here\nwe report a data-driven simulation of the well-observed X1.0 flare on 2014\nMarch 29 that can reconcile some well-known spectral discrepancies. We analyzed\nspectra of the flaring region from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\n(IRIS) in MgII h&k, the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectropolarimeter at the\nDunn Solar Telescope (DST/IBIS) in H$\\alpha$ 6563 \\AA\\ and CaII 8542 \\AA, and\nthe Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in hard\nX-rays. We constructed a multi-threaded flare loop model and used the electron\nflux inferred from RHESSI data as the input to the radiative hydrodynamic code\nRADYN to simulate the atmospheric response. We then synthesized various\nchromospheric emission lines and compared them with the IRIS and IBIS\nobservations. In general, the synthetic intensities agree with the observed\nones, especially near the northern footpoint of the flare. The simulated MgII\nline profile has narrower wings than the observed one. This discrepancy can be\nreduced by using a higher microturbulent velocity (27 km/s) in a narrow\nchromospheric layer. In addition, we found that an increase of electron density\nin the upper chromosphere within a narrow height range of $\\approx$800 km below\nthe transition region can turn the simulated MgII line core into emission and\nthus reproduce the single peaked profile, which is a common feature in all IRIS\nflares.\n", "  Using a graphical presentation of the spin $S$ one dimensional Valence Bond\nSolid (VBS) state, based on the representation theory of the $SU(2)$\nLie-algebra of spins, we compute the spectrum of a mixed state reduced density\nmatrix. This mixed state of two blocks of spins $A$ and $B$ is obtained by\ntracing out the spins outside $A$ and $B$, in the pure VBS state density\nmatrix. We find in particular that the negativity of the mixed state is\nnon-zero only for adjacent subsystems. The method introduced here can be\ngeneralized to the computation of entanglement properties in Levin-Wen models,\nthat possess a similar algebraic structure to the VBS state in the groundstate.\n", "  We show numerically that a harmonically trapped and coherently Rabi-coupled\nthree-component Bose-Einstein condensate can host unconventional vortex\nlattices in its rotating ground state. The discovered lattices incorporate\nsquare and zig-zag patterns, vortex dimers and chains, and doubly quantized\nvortices, and they can be quantitatively classified in terms of a skyrmionic\ntopological index, which takes into account the multicomponent nature of the\nsystem. The exotic ground-state lattices arise due to the intricate interplay\nof the repulsive density-density interactions and the Rabi couplings as well as\nthe ubiquitous phase frustration between the components. In the frustrated\nstate, domain walls in the relative phases can persist between some components\neven at strong Rabi coupling, while vanishing between others. Consequently, in\nthis limit the three-component condensate effectively approaches a\ntwo-component condensate with only density-density interactions. At\nintermediate Rabi coupling strengths, however, we face unique vortex physics\nthat occurs neither in the two-component counterpart nor in the purely\ndensity-density-coupled three-component system.\n", "  Two triplet vector-like quarks (VLQs) with hypercharges of $Y=2/3, -1/3$ and\none singlet scalar boson are embedded in the standard model (SM) to resolve the\n750 GeV diphoton excess. The constraints on the tree-level Higgs- and\n$Z$-mediated flavor-changing neutral currents are discussed in detail. Besides\nthe resolution of excess, it is found that the signal strength of diphoton\nHiggs decay can have a $10\\%$ deviation from the SM prediction and that the\nupper limits of the branching ratios for rare top-quark decays are $BR(t\\to c\n(h, Z)) < (6.8, 0.48) \\times 10^{-5}$. We find that the production cross\nsection of a single VLQ by electroweak processes is larger than that of\nVLQ-pair by QCD processes. To explore the signals of the heavy VLQs at the LHC,\nwe throughly analyze the production of single $X_{\\pm 5/3}$ and $Y_{\\mp 4/3}$\nvia $q_i q'_j$ annihilations in $pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. It is\nfound that the electroweak production cross sections for $d X_{5/3}$, $u\nY_{-4/3} $, and $d Y_{4/3} $ channels with $m_X=m_Y=1$ TeV can be $84.3$,\n$72.3$, and $157.8$ fb, respectively; and the dominant decay modes are $X_{5/3}\n\\to (c,t) W^+$ and $Y_{-4/3} \\to (s,b) W^-$. With adopting kinematic cuts, the\nsignificance for $pp\\to d W^+ t$ channel can be over $5\\sigma$.\n", "  A less well known variant of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with Nc colors and\nU(2)L X U(2)R chiral symmetry is studied in 1+1 dimensions. Using\nsemi-classical methods appropriate for the large Nc limit, we determine the\nvacuum manifold, the meson spectrum, massless and massive multi-fermion bound\nstates and the phase diagram as a function of temperature, chemical potential\nand isospin chemical potential. An important tool to understand soliton\ndynamics is the generalization of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock approach to\ntwo flavors along the lines recently developed by Takahashi in the context of\nunconventional fermionic superfluids and superconductors.\n", "  We consider a two-dimensional scalar field theory with a nilpotent current\nalgebra, which is dual to the Principal Chiral Model. The quantum theory is\nrenormalizable and not asymptotically free: the theory is strongly coupled at\nshort distances (encountering a Landau pole). We suggest it can serve as a toy\nmodel for $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory in four dimensions, just as the principal\nchiral model is a useful toy model for Yang-Mills theory. We find some\nclassical wave solutions that survive the strong coupling limit and quantize\nthem by the collective variable method. They describe excitations with an\nunusual dispersion relation $\\omega\\propto|k|^{\\frac{2}{3}}$ . Perhaps they are\nthe \"preons\" at strong coupling, whose bound states form massless particles\nover long distances.\n", "  Higher-order radiative corrections play an important role in precision\nstudies of the electroweak and Higgs sector, as well as for the detailed\nunderstanding of large backgrounds to new physics searches. For corrections\nbeyond the one-loop level and involving many independent mass and momentum\nscales, it is in general not possible to find analytic results, so that one\nneeds to resort to numerical methods instead. This article presents an overview\nover a variety of numerical loop integration techniques, highlighting their\nrange of applicability, suitability for automatization, and numerical precision\nand stability.\n  In a second part of this article, the application of numerical loop\nintegration methods in the area of electroweak precision tests is illustrated.\nNumerical methods were essential for obtaining full two-loop predictions for\nthe most important precision observables within the Standard Model. The\ntheoretical foundations for these corrections will be described in some detail,\nincluding aspects of the renormalization, resummation of leading loop\ncontributions, and the evaluation of the theory uncertainty from missing higher\norders.\n", "  When conformal field theories (CFTs) are perturbed by marginally relevant\ndeformations, renormalization group (RG) flows ensue that can be studied with\nperturbative methods, at least as long as they remain close to the original\nCFT. In this work we study such RG flows in the vicinity of six-dimensional\nunitary CFTs. Neglecting effects of scalar operators of dimension two and four,\nwe use Weyl consistency conditions to prove the $a$-theorem in perturbation\ntheory, and establish that scale implies conformal invariance. We identify a\nquantity that monotonically decreases in the flow to the infrared due to\nunitarity, showing that it does not agree with the one studied recently in the\nliterature on the six-dimensional $\\phi^3$ theory.\n", "  Jarzynski's theorem is a well-known equality in statistical mechanics, which\nrelates fluctuations in the work performed during a non-equilibrium\ntransformation of a system, to the free-energy difference between two\nequilibrium ensembles. In this article, we apply Jarzynski's theorem in lattice\ngauge theory, for two examples of challenging computational problems, namely\nthe calculation of interface free energies and the determination of the\nequation of state. We conclude with a discussion of further applications of\ninterest in QCD and in other strongly coupled gauge theories, in particular for\nthe Schroedinger functional and for simulations at finite density using\nreweighting techniques.\n", "  Partonic matter produced in the early stage of ultrarelativistic\nnucleus-nucleus collisions is assumed to be composed mainly of gluons, and\nquarks and antiquarks are produced at later times. To study the implications of\nsuch a scenario, the dynamical evolution of a chemically nonequilibrated system\nis described by the ideal (2+1)-dimensional hydrodynamics with a time dependent\n(anti)quark fugacity. The equation of state interpolates linearly between the\nlattice data for the pure gluonic matter and the lattice data for the\nchemically equilibrated quark-gluon plasma. The spectra and elliptic flows of\nthermal dileptons and photons are calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at\nthe CERN Large Hadron Collider energy of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV. We\ntest the sensitivity of the results to the choice of equilibration times,\nincluding also the case where the complete chemical equilibrium of partons is\nreached already at the initial stage. It is shown that a suppression of quarks\nat early times leads to a significant reduction of the yield of the thermal\ndileptons, but only to a rather modest suppression of the $p_T$-distribution of\ndirect photons. It is demonstrated that an enhancement of photon and dilepton\nelliptic flows might serve as a promising signature of the pure-glue initial\nstate.\n", "  We calculate 1-loop corrections to the Schwinger-Keldysh propagators of\nStandard-Model-like fields of spin-0, 1/2, and 1, with all renormalizable\ninteractions during inflation. We pay special attention to the late-time\ndivergences of loop corrections, and show that the divergences can be resummed\ninto finite results in the late-time limit using dynamical renormalization\ngroup method. This is our first step toward studying both the standard model\nand new physics in the primordial universe.\n", "  We review the present knowledge for $\\alpha_s$, the fundamental coupling\nunderlying the interactions of quarks and gluons in QCD. The dependence of\n$\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ on momentum transfer $Q$ encodes the underlying dynamics of\nhadron physics -from color confinement in the infrared domain to asymptotic\nfreedom at short distances. We review constraints on $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ at high\n$Q^2$, as predicted by perturbative QCD, and its analytic behavior at small\n$Q^2$, based on models of nonperturbative dynamics. In the introductory part of\nthis review, we explain the phenomenological meaning of $\\alpha_s$, the reason\nfor its running, and the challenges facing a complete understanding of its\nanalytic behavior in the infrared domain. In the second, more technical, part\nof the review, we discuss the behavior of $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ in the high $Q^2$\ndomain of QCD. We review how $\\alpha_s$ is defined, including its\nrenormalization scheme dependence, the definition of its renormalization scale,\nthe utility of effective charges, as well as Commensurate Scale Relations which\nconnect the various definitions of $\\alpha_s$ without renormalization-scale\nambiguity. We also report recent measurements and theoretical analyses which\nhave led to precise QCD predictions at high energy. In the last part of the\nreview, we discuss the challenge of understanding the analytic behavior\n$\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ in the infrared domain. We also review important methods for\ncomputing $\\alpha_s$, including lattice QCD, the Schwinger-Dyson equations, the\nGribov-Zwanziger analysis and light-front holographic QCD. After describing\nthese approaches and enumerating their conflicting predictions, we discuss the\norigin of these discrepancies and how to remedy them. Our aim is not only to\nreview the advances in this difficult area, but also to suggest what could be\nan optimal definition of $\\alpha_s$ in order to bring better unity to the\nsubject.\n", "  In this work, we study the propagation of scalar fields in the gravitational\nbackground of a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-de-Sitter black hole as well\nas on the projected-on-the-brane 4-dimensional background. The scalar fields\nhave also a non-minimal coupling to the corresponding, bulk or brane, scalar\ncurvature. We perform a comprehensive study by deriving exact numerical results\nfor the greybody factors, and study their profile in terms of particle and\nspacetime properties. We then proceed to derive the Hawking radiation spectra\nfor a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-de-Sitter black hole, and we study both\nbulk and brane channels. We demonstrate that the non-minimal field coupling,\nthat creates an effective mass term for the fields, suppresses the energy\nemission rates while the cosmological constant assumes a dual role. By\ncomputing the relative energy rates and the total emissivity ratio for bulk and\nbrane emission, we demonstrate that the combined effect of a large number of\nextra dimensions and value of the field coupling gives to the bulk channel the\nclear domination in the bulk-brane energy balance.\n", "  In this paper, a quantum mechanical Green's function $G_{qo}(y_b,t_b;$\n$y_a,t_a)$ for the quartic oscillator is presented. This result is built upon\ntwo previous papers: first [1], detailing the linearization of the quartic\noscillator $(qo)$ to the harmonic oscillator $(ho)$, second [2], the\nintegration of the classical action function for the quartic oscillator. Here\nan equivalent form for the quartic oscillator action function $S_{qo}(y_b,t_b;$\n$y_a,t_a)$ in terms of harmonic oscillator variables is derived in order to\nfacilitate the derivation of the quartic oscillator Green's Function amplitude.\nThus, the papers [1] and [2] and this paper, taken together, result in the\nincorporation of the quartic oscillator into the non-relativistic quantum\nmechanical physics literature consisting of those single particle systems whose\nproperties are described in terms of trig functions, their quadratures or both.\n", "  Rayleigh scattering is a result of an interaction of photons with bound\nelectrons. Rayleigh scattering is mostly neglected in calculations of hot star\nmodel atmospheres because most of the hydrogen atoms are ionized and the\nheavier elements have a lower abundance than hydrogen. In atmospheres of some\nchemically peculiar stars, helium overabundant regions containing singly\nionized helium are present and Rayleigh scattering can be a significant opacity\nsource.\n  We evaluate the contribution of Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen and\nsingly ionized helium in the atmospheres of hot stars with solar composition\nand in the atmospheres of helium overabundant stars. We computed several series\nof model atmospheres using the TLUSTY code and emergent fluxes using the\nSYNSPEC code. These models describe atmospheres of main sequence B-type stars\nwith different helium abundance. We used an existing grid of models for\natmospheres with solar chemical composition and we calculated an additional\ngrid for helium-rich stars with $N$(He)/$N$(H)=10.\n  Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen can be neglected in atmospheres of\nhot stars, while Rayleigh scattering by singly ionized helium can be a\nnon-negligible opacity source in some hot stars, especially in helium-rich\nstars.\n", "  Guided waves and surface waves can be taken as two typical examples of\nstructured optical fields with the transverse spin. Analytical derivations are\ndeveloped to demonstrate that (i) guided waves also carry the transverse spin\nthat depends on the mean direction of propagation, which may have important\napplications in spin-dependent unidirectional optical interfaces; (ii) the\nquantization form of the transverse spin is for the first time revealed, which\nis not obvious and related to an ellipticity; (iii) from a unified point of\nview, the transverse spin can be attributed to the presence of an effective\nrest mass of structured optical fields; (iv) the transverse spin can also be\ndescribed by the spin matrix of the photon field; (v) unlike a free optical\nfield whose spin projection on the propagation direction is the only\nobservable, owing to the effective rest mass, the spin projection of structured\noptical fields on other directions is also an observable, such that one can\ndevelop an optical analogy of spintronics. A preliminary idea about the\npotential applications of the transverse spin is presented, but an in-depth and\ncomplete study will be presented in our next work.\n", "  A search for new physics is performed using events with two isolated\nsame-sign leptons, two or more jets, and missing transverse momentum. The\nresults are based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 2.3 inverse femtobarns. Multiple search regions are\ndefined by classifying events in terms of missing transverse momentum, the\nscalar sum of jet transverse momenta, the transverse mass associated with a W\nboson candidate, the number of jets, the number of b quark jets, and the\ntransverse momenta of the leptons in the event. The analysis is sensitive to a\nwide variety of possible signals beyond the standard model. No excess above the\nstandard model background expectation is observed. Constraints are set on\nvarious supersymmetric models, with gluinos and bottom squarks excluded for\nmasses up to 1300 and 680 GeV, respectively, at the 95% confidence level. Upper\nlimits on the cross sections for the production of two top quark-antiquark\npairs (119 fb) and two same-sign top quarks (1.7 pb) are also obtained.\nSelection efficiencies and model independent limits are provided to allow\nfurther interpretations of the results.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of top polarization observables to the CP phase\n$\\zeta_t$ in the top Yukawa coupling in the process $pp\\to thj$ at the 14 TeV\nhigh-luminosity run of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). We calculate the top\npolarization in this process as well as an azimuthal asymmetry of the charged\nlepton arising from the decay of the top in the lab frame. We find that the\ndependence of this lab-frame azimuthal asymmetry on the phase $\\zeta_t$ closely\nresembles the dependence of the top polarization on $\\zeta_t$. As compared to\nthe cross section, which is sensitive to $\\zeta_t$ for larger values, the\nlepton azimuthal asymmetry can provide a sensitive measurement of $\\zeta_t$ for\nsmaller values.\n", "  A measurement of the double-differential inclusive jet cross section as a\nfunction of jet transverse momentum pT and absolute jet rapidity |y| is\npresented. The analysis is based on proton-proton collisions collected by the\nCMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The data\nsamples correspond to integrated luminosities of 71 and 44 inverse picobarns\nfor |y| < 3 and 3.2 < |y| < 4.7, respectively. Jets are reconstructed with the\nanti-kt clustering algorithm for two jet sizes, R, of 0.7 and 0.4, in a phase\nspace region covering jet pT up to 2 TeV and jet rapidity up to |y| = 4.7.\nPredictions of perturbative quantum chromodynamics at next-to-leading order\nprecision, complemented with electroweak and nonperturbative corrections, are\nused to compute the absolute scale and the shape of the inclusive jet cross\nsection. The cross section difference in R, when going to a smaller jet size of\n0.4, is best described by Monte Carlo event generators with next-to-leading\norder predictions matched to parton showering, hadronisation, and multiparton\ninteractions. In the phase space accessible with the new data, this measurement\nprovides a first indication that jet physics is as well understood at sqrt(s) =\n13 TeV as at smaller centre-of-mass energies.\n", "  We consider higher-order derivative interactions beyond second-order\ngeneralized Proca theories that propagate only the three desired polarizations\nof a massive vector field besides the two tensor polarizations from gravity.\nThese new interactions follow the similar construction criteria to those\narising in the extension of scalar-tensor Horndeski theories to\nGleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV) theories. On the isotropic cosmological\nbackground, we show the existence of a constraint with a vanishing Hamiltonian\nthat removes the would-be Ostrogradski ghost. We study the behavior of linear\nperturbations on top of the isotropic cosmological background in the presence\nof a matter perfect fluid and find the same number of propagating degrees of\nfreedom as in generalized Proca theories (two tensor polarizations, two\ntransverse vector modes, and two scalar modes). Moreover, we obtain the\nconditions for the avoidance of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of tensor,\nvector, and scalar perturbations. We observe key differences in the scalar\nsound speed, which is mixed with the matter sound speed outside the domain of\ngeneralized Proca theories.\n", "  Hadronic resonance propagators which take into account the analytical\nproperties of decay processes are built in terms of the dispersion relation\ntechnique. Such propagators can describe multi-component systems, for example,\nthose when quark degrees of freedom create a resonance state, and decay\nproducts correct the corresponding pole by adding hadronic deuteron-like\ncomponents. Meson and baryon states are considered, examples of particles with\ndifferent spins are presented.\n", "  We study the general structure of correlation functions in an\nSp(2n)-invariant formulation of systems of an infinite number of higher-spin\nfields. For n=4,8 and 16 these systems comprise the conformal higher-spin\nfields in space-time dimensions D=4,6 and 10, respectively, while when n=2, one\ndeals with conventional D=3 conformal field theories of scalars and spinors. We\nshow that for n>2 the Sp(2n) symmetry and current conservation makes the\n3-point correlators of two (rank-one or rank-two) conserved currents with a\nscalar operator be that of free theory.This situation is analogous to the one\nin conventional conformal field theories, where conservation of higher-spin\ncurrents implies that the theories are free.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically investigate a particular experimental setup\nwhich coalesces the concepts of the double slit and single slit diffraction. In\nThomas Young's classic double slit experiment, monochromatic plane light wave\nimpinges on an opaque screen with two parallel, long and narrow slits and the\nresulting intensity pattern is observed on a screen placed at a great distance\nplaced from the slits. We show, via theoretical calculations that the if\nanother opaque screen with a single long narrow slit is placed at a distance\nfrom the two slits, the resulting intensity pattern on the observation screen\nis nontrivial and interesting.\n", "  The time-dependent Mott transition in a periodic Anderson model with\noff-site, nearest-neighbor hybridization is studied within the framework of\nnonequilibrium self-energy functional theory. Using the two-site\ndynamical-impurity approximation, we compute the real-time dynamics of the\noptimal variational parameter and of different observables initiated by sudden\nquenches of the Hubbard-U and identify the critical interaction. The\ntime-dependent transition is orbital selective, i.e., in the final state,\nreached in the long-time limit after the quench to the critical interaction,\nthe Mott gap opens in the spectral function of the localized orbitals only. We\ndiscuss the dependence of the critical interaction and of the final-state\neffective temperature on the hybridization strength and point out the various\nsimilarities between the nonequilibrium and the equilibrium Mott transition. It\nis shown that these can also be smoothly connected to each other by increasing\nthe duration of a U-ramp from a sudden quench to a quasi-static process. The\nphysics found for the model with off-site hybridization is compared with the\ndynamical Mott transition in the single-orbital Hubbard model and with the\ndynamical crossover found for the real-time dynamics of the conventional\nAnderson lattice with on-site hybridization.\n", "  Processes involving multi-input multi-step reaction cascades are used in\ndeveloping novel biosensing, biocomputing, and decision making systems. In\nvarious applications different changes in responses of the constituent\nprocessing steps (reactions) in a cascade are desirable in order to allow\ncontrol of the system's response. Here we consider conversion of convex\nresponse to sigmoid by \"intensity filtering,\" as well as \"threshold filtering,\"\nand we offer a general overview of this field of research. Specifically, we\nsurvey rate equation modelling that has been used for enzymatic reactions. This\nallows us to design modified biochemical processes as \"network components\" with\nresponses desirable in applications.\n", "  We report the formation of alternating strings and clusters in a binary\nsuspension of repulsive charged colloids with double layers larger than the\nparticle size. Within a binary cell model we include many-body and\ncharge-regulation effects under the assumption of a constant surface potential,\nand consider their repercussions on the two-particle interaction potential. We\nfind that the formation of induced dipoles close to a charge-reversed state may\nexplain the formation of these structures. Finally, we will touch upon the\nformation of dumbbells and small clusters in a one-component system, where the\neffective electrostatic interaction is always repulsive.\n", "  The EM algorithm is a novel numerical method to obtain maximum likelihood\nestimates and is often used for practical calculations. However, many of\nmaximum likelihood estimation problems are nonconvex, and it is known that the\nEM algorithm fails to give the optimal estimate by being trapped by local\noptima. In order to deal with this difficulty, we propose a deterministic\nquantum annealing EM algorithm by introducing the mathematical mechanism of\nquantum fluctuations into the conventional EM algorithm because quantum\nfluctuations induce the tunnel effect and are expected to relax the difficulty\nof nonconvex optimization problems in the maximum likelihood estimation\nproblems. We show a theorem that guarantees its convergence and give numerical\nexperiments to verify its efficiency.\n", "  In this paper the compatibility is analyzed of the non-perturbative equations\nof state of quarks and gluons arising from the lattice with some natural\nrequirements for self-gravitating objects at equilibrium: the existence of an\nequation of state (namely, the possibility to define the pressure as a function\nof the energy density), the absence of superluminal propagation and Le\nChatelier's principle. It is discussed under which conditions it is possible to\nextract an equation of state (in the above sense) from the non-perturbative\npropagators arising from the fits of the latest lattice data. In the quark\ncase, there is a small but non-vanishing range of temperatures in which it is\nnot possible to define a single-valued functional relation between density and\npressure. Interestingly enough, a small change of the parameters appearing in\nthe fit of the lattice quark propagator (of around 10~\\%) could guarantee the\nfulfillment of all the three conditions (keeping alive, at the same time, the\nviolation of positivity of the spectral representation, which is the expected\nsignal of confinement). As far as gluons are concerned, the analysis shows very\nsimilar results. Whether or not the non-perturbative quark and gluon\npropagators satisfy these conditions can have a strong impact on the estimate\nof the maximal mass of quark stars.\n", "  Using a Luttinger liquid theory we investigate the time evolution of the\nparticle density of a one-dimensional fermionic system with open boundaries and\nsubject to a finite duration quench of the inter-particle interaction. We\nprovide analytical and asymptotic solutions to the unitary time evolution of\nthe system, showing that both switching on and switching off the quench ramp\ncreate light-cone perturbations in the density. The post-quench dynamics is\nstrongly affected by the interference between these two perturbations. In\nparticular, we find that the discrepancy between the time-dependent density and\nthe one obtained by a generalized Gibbs ensemble picture vanishes with an\noscillatory behavior as a function of the quench duration, with local minima\ncorresponding to a perfect overlap of the two light-cone perturbations. For\nadiabatic quenches, we also obtain a similar behavior in the approach of the\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble density towards the one associated with the ground\nstate of the final Hamiltonian.\n", "  We show that with spatially incoherent illumination, the point spread\nfunction width of an imaging interferometer like that used in full-field\noptical coherence tomography (FFOCT) is almost insensitive to aberrations that\nmostly induce a reduction of the signal level without broadening. This is\ndemonstrated by comparison with traditional scanning OCT and wide-field OCT\nwith spatially coherent illuminations. Theoretical analysis, numerical\ncalculation as well as experimental results are provided to show this specific\nmerit of incoherent illumination in full-field OCT. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time that such result has been demonstrated.\n", "  The response of electromagnetic (EM) fields that are produced in non-central\nheavy-ion collisions to electromagnetically charged quark gluon plasma can be\nunderstood in terms of charge transport and charge diffusion in the hot QCD\nmedium. This article presents a perspective on these processes by investigating\nthe temperature behavior of the related transport coefficients, {\\it viz.}\nelectrical conductivity and the charge diffusion coefficients along with charge\nsusceptibility. In the process of estimating them, thermal relaxation times for\nquarks and gluons have been determined first. These transport coefficients have\nbeen studied by solving the relativistic transport equation in the\nChapman-Enskog method. For the analysis, $2\\rightarrow 2$, quark-quark,\nquark-gluon and gluon-gluon scattering processes are taken into account along\nwith an effective description of hot QCD Equations of state (EOSs) in terms of\ntemperature dependent effective fugacities of quasi-quarks (anti-quarks) and\nquasi-gluons. Both improved perturbative hot QCD EOSs at high temperature and a\nlattice QCD EOS are included for the analysis. The hot QCD medium effects\nentering through the quasi-particle momentum distributions along with an\neffective coupling, are seen to have significant impact on the temperature\nbehavior of these transport parameters along with the thermal relaxation times\nfor the quasi-gluons and quasi-quarks\n", "  Colloidal particles were exposed to a random potential energy landscape\n(rPEL) that has been created optically via a speckle pattern. The mean particle\ndensity as well as the potential roughness, i.e. the disorder strength, were\nvaried. The local probability density of the particles as well as its main\ncharacteristics were determined. For the first time, the disorder-averaged pair\ndensity correlation function and an analogue of the Edwards-Anderson order\nparameter, which quantifies the correlation of the mean local density among\ndisorder realisations, were measured experimentally and shown to be consistent\nwith replica liquid state theory results.\n", "  Using the (2+1)-dimensional ultrarelativistic viscous hydrodynamics+hadron\ncascade, VISHNU, hybrid model, we study the $p_{\\rm T}$-spectra and elliptic\nflow of $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and $\\Omega$ in Au+Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV.\nComparing our model results with the data measurements, we find that the VISHNU\nmodel gives general descriptions of the measurements of these strange and\nmulti-strange hadrons at several centrality classes at RHIC and LHC. Mass\nordering of elliptic flow $v_{2}$ among $\\pi$, $K$, $p$, $\\Lambda$, $\\Xi$, and\n$\\Omega$ are further investigated and discussed at the two collision systems.\nWe find, at both RHIC and LHC, the $v_{2}$ mass ordering among $\\pi$, $K$, $p$,\nand $\\Omega$ are fairly reproduced within the VISHNU hybrid model, and more\nimprovements are needed to implement for well describing the $v_{2}$ mass\nordering among $p$, $\\Lambda$, and $\\Xi$.\n", "  It is proven that a solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations whose\ngravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields vanish is in fact stationary\nin a neighbourhood of spatial infinity. That is, if the Weyl and Faraday\ntensors decay suitably fast, then there exists a time-like Killing vector field\nin the region outside the bifurcate horizon of a sphere of sufficiently large\nradius. In particular, truly dynamical time-periodic electrovacuum spacetimes\ndo not exist. This is an extension of earlier work by Alexakis and Schlue and\nBi\\v{c}\\'{a}k, Sholtz and Tod to include electromagnetism.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrated strong adiabatic mixed-field orientation of\ncarbonyl sulfide molecules (OCS) in their absolute ground state of\n$\\text{N}_{\\text{up}}/\\text{N}_{\\text{tot}}=0.882$. OCS was oriented in\ncombined non-resonant laser and static electric fields inside a two-plate\nvelocity map imaging spectrometer. The transition from non-adiabatic to\nadiabatic orientation for the rotational ground state was studied by varying\nthe applied laser and static electric field. Above static electric field\nstrengths of 10 kV/cm and laser intensities of $10^{11} \\text{W/cm}^2$ the\nobserved degree of orientation reached a plateau. These results are in good\nagreement with computational solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n", "  The charged black hole thermodynamics is corrected in terms of the quantum\ngravity effects. Most of the quantum gravity theories support the idea that\nnear the Planck scale, the standard Heisenberg uncertainty principle should be\nreformulated by the so-called Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) which\nprovides a perturbation framework to perform required modifications of the\nblack hole quantities. In this paper, we consider the effects of the minimal\nlength and maximal momentum as GUP type I and the minimal length, minimal\nmomentum, and maximal momentum as GUP type II on thermodynamics of the charged\nTeV-scale black holes. We also generalized our study to the universe with the\nextra dimensions based on the ADD model. In this framework, the effect of the\nelectrical charge on thermodynamics of the black hole and existence of the\ncharged black hole remnants as a potential candidate for the dark matter\nparticles are discussed.\n", "  Using Cartan's exterior calculus, we derive a coordinate-free formulation of\nthe Euler equations. These equations are invariant under Galileian\ntransformations, which constitute a global symmetry. With the introduction of\nan appropriate generalized Coriolis force, these equations become symmetric\nunder general coordinate transformations.\n  We show how exterior calculus simplifies dramatically the derivation of\nconservation laws. We also discuss the advantage of an exterior calculus\nformulation with respect to symmetry-preserving discretizations of the\nequations.\n", "  We present 3.7 arcsec (~0.05 pc) resolution 3.2 mm dust continuum\nobservations from the IRAM PdBI, with the aim of studying the structure and\nfragmentation of the filamentary Infrared Dark Cloud G035.39-00.33. The\ncontinuum emission is segmented into a series of 13 quasi-regularly spaced\n(~0.18pc) cores, following the major axis of the IRDC. We compare the spatial\ndistribution of the cores with that predicted by theoretical work describing\nthe fragmentation of hydrodynamic fluid cylinders, finding a significant (a\nfactor of ~8) discrepancy between the two. Our observations are consistent with\nthe picture emerging from kinematic studies of molecular clouds suggesting that\nthe cores are harboured within a complex network of independent sub-filaments.\nThis result emphasizes the importance of considering the underlying physical\nstructure, and potentially, dynamically important magnetic fields, in any\nfragmentation analysis. The identified cores exhibit a range in (peak)\nbeam-averaged column density ($3.6{\\rm x}10^{23}{\\rm cm}^{-2}<N_{H,c}<8.0{\\rm\nx}10^{23}{\\rm cm}^{-2}$), mass ($8.1M_{\\odot}<M_{c}<26.1M_{\\odot}$), and number\ndensity ($6.1{\\rm x}10^{5}{\\rm cm}^{-3}<n_{H, c, eq}<14.7{\\rm x}10^{5}{\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$). Two of these cores, dark in the mid-infrared,\ncentrally-concentrated, monolithic (with no traceable substructure at our PdBI\nresolution), and with estimated masses of the order ~20-25$M_{\\odot}$, are good\ncandidates for the progenitors of intermediate-to-high-mass stars. Virial\nparameters span a range $0.2<\\alpha_{\\rm vir}<1.3$. Without additional support,\npossibly from dynamically important magnetic fields with strengths of the order\n230$\\mu$G<B<670$\\mu$G, the cores are susceptible to gravitational collapse.\nThese results may imply a multilayered fragmentation process, which\nincorporates the formation of sub-filaments, embedded cores, and the\npossibility of further fragmentation.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce an optical analogy to quantum Fourier\ntanformation based on a pseudorandom phase ensemble. The optical analogy also\nbrings about exponential speedup over classical Fourier tanformation. Using the\nanalogy, we demonstrate three classcial fields to realize Fourier transform\nsimilar to three quantum particles.\n", "  In this work we revisit the problem of contributions of excited holographic\nstates to the entanglement entropy in two-dimensional conformal field theories.\nUsing the results of replica trick method we find three expressions for these\ncontributions. First, we express the contribution of the excited states in\nterms of Aharonov invariants. It is shown that beside the Schwarzian, the\none-point functions of descendants of energy-momentum also contribute. Given\nSchwarz-Christoffel map, the contributions to any order can be easily computed.\nThe second expression relates the entanglement entropy of excited states to\nFaber polynomials and Grunsky coefficients. Based on the relation of Grunsky\ncoefficiens to tau-funcion of dispersionless Toda hierarchy, we find the third\nexpression for contributions of excited holographic states to the entanglement\nentropy.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate theoretically the spin-orbit torque as well as\nthe Gilbert damping for a two band model of a 2D helical surface state with a\nFerromagnetic (FM) exchange coupling. We decompose the density matrix into the\nFermi sea and Fermi surface components and obtain their contributions to the\nelectronic transport as well as the spin-orbit torque (SOT). Furthermore, we\nobtain the expression for the Gilbert damping due to the surface state of a 3D\nTopological Insulator (TI) and predicted its dependence on the direction of the\nmagnetization precession axis.\n", "  Resonance plays critical roles in the formation of many physical phenomena,\nand several methods have been developed for the exploration of resonance. In\nthis work, we propose a new scheme for resonance by solving the Dirac equation\nin complex momentum representation, in which the resonant states are exposed\nclearly in complex momentum plane and the resonance parameters can be\ndetermined precisely without imposing unphysical parameters. Combining with the\nrelativistic mean-field theory, this method is applied to probe the resonances\nin $^{120}$Sn with the energies, widths, and wavefunctions being obtained.\nComparing with other methods, this method is not only very effective for narrow\nresonances, but also can be reliably applied to broad resonances.\n", "  General formulas for calculating the several leading long-range interactions\namong three identical atoms where two atoms are in identical $S$ states and the\nother atom is in a $P$ state are obtained using perturbation theory for the\nenergies up to second order. The first order (dipolar) interactions depend on\nthe geometrical configurations of the three atoms. In second order, additive\nand nonadditive dispersion interactions are obtained. The nonadditive\ninteractions depend on the geometrical configurations in marked contrast to the\ncase where all three atoms are in identical $S$ states, for which the\nnonadditive (also known as triple-dipole or as Axilrod-Muto-Teller) dispersion\ninteractions appear at the third order. The formalism is demonstrated by the\ncalculation of the coefficients for the\nLi($2\\,^2S$)-Li($2\\,^2S$)-Li($2\\,^{2}P$) system using variationally-generated\natomic lithium wave functions in Hylleraas coordinates. The present dipolar\ncoefficients and additive and nonadditive dispersion coefficients may be useful\nin constructing precise potential energy surfaces for this three lithium atom\nsystem.\n", "  IRIS (InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph) is the diffraction-limited first light\ninstrument for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) that consists of a\nnear-infrared (0.84 to 2.4 $\\mu$m) imager and integral field spectrograph\n(IFS). The IFS makes use of a lenslet array and slicer for spatial sampling,\nwhich will be able to operate in 100's of different modes, including a\ncombination of four plate scales from 4 milliarcseconds (mas) to 50 mas with a\nlarge range of filters and gratings. The imager will have a field of view of\n34$\\times$34 arcsec$^{2}$ with a plate scale of 4 mas with many selectable\nfilters. We present the preliminary design of the data reduction system (DRS)\nfor IRIS that need to address all of these observing modes. Reduction of IRIS\ndata will have unique challenges since it will provide real-time reduction and\nanalysis of the imaging and spectroscopic data during observational sequences,\nas well as advanced post-processing algorithms. The DRS will support three\nbasic modes of operation of IRIS; reducing data from the imager, the lenslet\nIFS, and slicer IFS. The DRS will be written in Python, making use of\nopen-source astronomical packages available. In addition to real-time data\nreduction, the DRS will utilize real-time visualization tools, providing\nastronomers with up-to-date evaluation of the target acquisition and data\nquality. The quicklook suite will include visualization tools for 1D, 2D, and\n3D raw and reduced images. We discuss the overall requirements of the DRS and\nvisualization tools, as well as necessary calibration data to achieve optimal\ndata quality in order to exploit science cases across all cosmic distance\nscales.\n", "  We prove an analog of the Verlinde formula on the moduli space of semistable\nmeromorphic G-Higgs bundles over a smooth curve for a reductive group G whose\nfundamental group is free. The formula expresses the graded dimension of the\nspace of sections of a positive line bundle as a finite sum whose terms are\nindexed by formal solutions of a generalized Bethe ansatz equation on the\nmaximal torus of G. In an appendix, Constantin Teleman proves a vanishing\ntheorem for the higher cohomology of positive line bundles on the stack of\nHiggs bundles.\n", "  Considerations on implementation of the stress-strain constitutive relations\napplied in Computational Fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of cardiovascular\nflows have been addressed extensively in the literature. However, the matter is\nyet controversial. The author suggests that the choice of non-Newtonian models\nand the consideration of non-Newtonian assumption versus the Newtonian\nassumption is very application oriented and cannot be solely dependent on the\nvessel size. In the presented work, where a renal disease patient-specific\ngeometry is used, the non-Newtonian effects manifest insignificant, while the\nvessel is considered to be medium to small which, according to the literature,\nsuggest a strict use of non-Newtonian formulation. The insignificance of the\nnon-Newtonian effects specially manifests in Wall Shear Stress (WSS) along the\nwalls of the numerical domain, where the differences between Newtonian\ncalculated WSS and non-Newtonian calculated WSS is barely visible.\n", "  Entwinement is the entanglement entropy of a subset of gauge-variant degrees\nof freedom in a certain twisted state of an orbifold CFT, defined by embedding\nthe state in a larger Hilbert space with some gauge constraints removed. We\npropose an intrinsically gauge-invariant, algebraic definition of entwinement.\nOur main piece of evidence is a computation showing that, in a spin system that\nresembles the orbifold CFT, the analog of entwinement is the entanglement\nentropy of a gauge-invariant subalgebra, which we identify. We review why\nentwinement is relevant for the conjecture that entanglement builds spacetime.\n", "  By numerical simulation methods the interactions of oscillating solutions\n(breathers) of the (2+1)-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model is\ninvestigated. The models of head-on collisions in which the interacting\nbreathers, in particular, are combined into a single oscillating soliton, the\nreflections from each other and pass through each other are obtained.\n", "  We propose to simulate 3D Dirac points and line-nodes with nontrivial $Z_2$\ntopology in nonsymmorphic all-dielectric photonic-crystals with space-time\nreversal symmetry, which can be realized at infrared and microwave frequencies.\nDouble degeneracy of all Bloch states in high symmetry planes is achieved via\nnonsymmorphic screw symmetries despite the fundamental obstacle of no Kramers\ndegeneracy in photonic crystals. Two orthogonal screw axes lead to 3D $Z_2$\nDirac points on high symmetry Brillouin zone boundary lines. On the other hand,\n$Z_2$ line-nodes emerge as protected twofold degeneracy of Bloch bands with\nopposite mirror parities on the $k_z=0$ plane. The lowest frequency line-node\nis deterministic because of a degenerate-partner switching mechanism guaranteed\nby the fundamental properties of Maxwell equations and the nonsymmorphic screw\nsymmetry. A pair of Fermi arcs with opposite chirality due to $Z_2$ topological\nDirac points emerge below the light-line on (100) and (010)\nphotonic-crystal-air interfaces. These robust surface states offer an unique\nopportunity to realize an \"open cavity\" with strong interaction between quantum\nemitters and engineered vacuum with nontrivial Berry phases --- an important\nstep toward topological states of strongly interacting bosons. Realistic\ncalculation for resonant coupling between cavity-photons and phonons in boron\nnitride thin film yields ultrastrong coupling with vacuum Rabi splitting\nreaching to $23\\%$ of photon frequency. We also show that type-II Dirac cones\nhave anomalous valley selective refraction: birefringence with both positive\nand negative refractions for one valley, while no refraction for the other.\n", "  An ordinary differential equation describing the transverse profiles of\nU-shaped glacial valleys, derived with a variational principle, has two formal\nanalogies which we analyze. First, an analogy with point particle mechanics\ncompletes the description of the solutions. Second, an analogy with the\nFriedmann equation of relativistic cosmology shows that the analogue of a\nglacial valley profile is a universe with a future singularity but respecting\nthe weak energy condition. The equation unveils also a Big Freeze singularity,\nwhich was not observed before for positive curvature index.\n", "  Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools\nto successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were\ncomputationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color\nanalysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models\noutperformed general practitioners' average diagnostic success rate for\ndepression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts\nmade before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Photos posted by\ndepressed individuals were more likely to be bluer, grayer, and darker. Human\nratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of\ndepression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features.\nThese findings suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental\nillness.\n", "  This paper describes the beginning of the Far-Infrared Surveyor mission study\nfor NASA's Astrophysics Decadal 2020. We describe the scope of the study, and\nthe open process approach of the Science and Technology Definition Team. We are\ncurrently developing the science cases and provide some preliminary highlights\nhere. We note key areas for technological innovation and improvements necessary\nto make a Far-Infrared Surveyor mission a reality.\n", "  In this work, the results of fabricating ultra thin VO$_2$ films on the\ntechnologically relevant amorphous SiO$_2$ surface using reactive DC magnetron\nsputtering are presented. Results indicate that a post deposition anneal in low\npartial pressures of oxygen is an effective way at stabilizing the\nVO$_2$(M$_{1}$) phase on the SiO$_2$ surface. VO$_2$ films with a thickness of\n42nm show a continuous microstructure, and undergo a resistivity change of more\nthan a factor of 200 as the temperature of the film increases above 72$^{o}C$.\nThe film shows hysteresis in the metal-insulator transition temperature upon\nheating and cooling with a width of approximately 8$^o$C. The resistivity of\nthe low temperature semiconducting phase is found to be thermally activated\nwith an activation energy 0.16$\\pm$0.03 $ev$. Stress measurements using X-ray\ndiffraction indicate that the ultra thin VO$_2$ film has a large tensile stress\nof 2.0$\\pm$0.2 $GPa$. This value agrees well with the calculated thermal stress\ndue to differential thermal expansion between the VO$_2$ thin film and silicon\nsubstrate. The stress leads to a shift of the metal-insulator transition\ntemperature by approximately 4$^{o}C$.\n", "  We study the 6d $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theory with smallest\nnon-Higgsable gauge symmetry $SU(3)$. In particular, we propose new 2d gauge\ntheory descriptions of its self-dual strings in the tensor branch. We use our\ngauge theories to compute the elliptic genera of the self-dual strings, which\ncompletely agree with the partial data known from topological strings. We\nfurther study the strings of the $(E_6,E_6)$ conformal matter by generalizing\nour 2d gauge theories. We also show that anomalies of all our gauge theories\nagree with the self-dual string anomalies computed by inflows from 6d.\n", "  We introduce a qauantitative measure of spin-charge separation, $\\zeta (t)$\nwhich is based on the difference between the fluctuations with respect to\nbackground of the spin and charge profiles at any time t and is suitable for\nstudying the non-equilibrium dynamics of excitations in strongly correlated\nsystems. This quantity is not only a direct measure of the spin-charge\nseparation in strongly correlated systems, but its long time behaviour can\nfurther serve as a possible order parameter for the interaction induced (Mott)\ninsulating state. Within the nu- merically exact diagonzalization we calculate\nthis quantity for the two dimensional Hubbard model away from Half filling. Our\nquantitative measure in chain, ladder and two-dimensional geometries gives the\nsame order of magnitude for the quantity of spin-charge separation. Furthermore\nfrom the temporal behaviour of $\\zeta (t)$ a threshold time can be identified\nthat provides clues onto the breakdown of underlying Mott insulating phase.\n", "  We formulate a classification conjecture for conformally invariant families\nof measures on simple loops that builds on a conjecture of Kontsevich and\nSuhov. The main example in this class of objects was constructed by Werner as\nboundaries of Brownian loops. We present partial results towards the algebraic\nstep of this classification.\n  Solving this conjecture would provide another argument explaining why planar\nstatistical mechanics models with conformally invariant scaling limits\nnaturally occur in a one-parameter family, together with the dynamical\ncharacterization of SLE via Schramm's central limit argument, and with the\nconformal field theory point of view and its central charge parameter.\n", "  Robustness estimation is critical for the design and maintenance of resilient\nnetworks, one of the global challenges of the 21st century. Existing studies\nexploit network metrics to generate attack strategies, which simulate\nintentional attacks in a network, and compute a metric-induced robustness\nestimation. While some metrics are easy to compute, e.g. degree centrality,\nother, more accurate, metrics require considerable computation efforts, e.g.\nbetweennes centrality. We propose a new algorithm for estimating the robustness\nof a network in sub-quadratic time, i.e., significantly faster than betweenness\ncentrality. Experiments on real-world networks and random networks show that\nour algorithm estimates the robustness of networks close to or even better than\nbetweenness centrality, while being orders of magnitudes faster. Our work\ncontributes towards scalable, yet accurate methods for robustness estimation of\nlarge complex networks.\n", "  During his life Weyl approached the problem of space (PoS) from various\nsides. Two aspects stand out as permanent features of his different approaches:\nthe {\\em unique determination of an affine connection} (i.e., without torsion\nin the terminology of Cartan) and the question {\\em which type of group}\ncharacterizes physical space. The first feature came up in 1919 (commentaries\nto Riemann's inaugural lecture) and played a crucial role in Weyl's work on the\nPoS in the early 1920s. He defended the central role of affine connections even\nin the light of Cartan's more general framework of connections with torsion. In\nlater years, after the rise of the Dirac field, it could have become\nproblematic, but Weyl saw the challenge posed to Einstein gravity by spin\ncoupling primarily in the possibility to allow for non-metric affine\nconnections. Only after Weyl's death Cartan's approach to infinitesimal\nhomogeneity and torsion became revitalized in gravity theories.\n", "  Multiphase Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been used to\nstudy the jet breakup phenomena. It has been shown that this method is well\ncapable of capturing different jet breakup characteristics. The value obtained\nfor critical Weber number here in transition from dripping to jetting is a very\ngood match to available values in literature. Jet breakup lengths are also\nagreeing well with several empirical correlations. Successful usage of SPH, as\na comparably fast CFD solver, in jet breakup analysis helps in speeding up the\nnumerical study of this phenomenon.\n", "  The solubility of dodecane was determined using the theory of\nLifshitz-Slyosov-Wagner for the Ostwald ripening phenomenon. For this purpose,\na set of dodecane in water nanoemulsions stabilized with sodium dodecylsulfate\nwas prepared. The average cubic radius of the dispersions was followed as a\nfunction of time for volume fractions between 0.001 and 0.00001. The correct\nsolubility (5.5 x 10-9 m3/m3) was only reproduced by the most dilute system.\n", "  The famous, very young, helium rich, magnetically-active, radio and X-ray\nemitter, short-period rotationally variable, spectroscopically peculiar star\n{\\sigma} Ori E may have a close late-type stellar companion, which could\nexplain flaring activity observed in some {\\sigma} Ori E X-ray light curves. In\n2009, Bouy et al. announced the detection of a faint companion candidate in the\nKs band at 0.330 arcsec (130 AU) to the B2 Vp primary. Here, we carry out\nz'-band lucky imaging with AstraLux at the 2.2 m Calar Alto telescope in an\nattempt to constrain the properties of the companion candidate to {\\sigma} Ori\nE. We impose a maximum mass of 2.0+0.2-0.1 Msol and an earliest spectral type\nof K2+/-1, which leaves the door open to a new, inexpensive, near-infrared,\nadaptive-optics study.\n", "  Three-dimensional sand ripples can be observed under steady liquid flows in\nboth nature and industry. Some examples are the ripples observed on the bed of\nrivers and in petroleum pipelines conveying sand. Although of importance, the\nformation of these patterns is not completely understood. There are theoretical\nand experimental evidence that aquatic ripples grow from two-dimensional bed\ninstabilities, so that a straight vortex is formed just downstream of their\ncrests. The proposition of Raudkivi (2006), that three-dimensionality has its\norigin in a vortex instability, is employed here. This paper presents a linear\nstability analysis of the downstream vortex in order to obtain the transverse\nscales of three-dimensional ripples. The obtained wavelength is compared with\nexperimentally observed ripples.\n", "  Solid particles can be transported as a mobile granular bed, known as\nbed-load, by pressure-driven flows. A common case in industry is the presence\nof bed-load in stratified gas-liquid flows in horizontal ducts. In this case,\nan initially flat granular bed may be unstable, generating ripples and dunes.\nThis three-phase flow, although complex, can be modeled under some simplifying\nassumptions. This paper presents a model for the estimation of some bed-load\ncharacteristics. Based on parameters easily measurable in industry, the model\ncan predict the local bed-load flow rates and the celerity and the wavelength\nof instabilities appearing on the granular bed.\n", "  This paper addresses the total mechanical energy of a single degree of\nfreedom fractional oscillator. Based on the energy storage and dissipation\nproperties of the Caputo fractional derivatives, the expression for total\nmechanical energy in the single degree of freedom fractional oscillator is\nfirstly presented. The energy regeneration due to the external exciting force\nand the energy loss due to the fractional damping force during the vibratory\nmotion are analyzed. Furthermore, based on the mean energy dissipation of the\nfractional damping element in steady-state vibration, a new concept of mean\nequivalent viscous damping is suggested and the value of the damping\ncoefficient is evaluated.\n", "  In a large number of rare-earth and actinide systems, Kondo effect tends to\nsuppress magnetic order by making the spin singlet between localized and\nconduction electron spins. In the presence of orbital degrees of freedom,\nhowever, there emerge exotic electronic orders induced by Kondo effect. The\norbital Kondo effect can collectively make diagonal and off-diagonal\n(superconducting) orders. With the particle-hole symmetry in conduction bands,\nthese orders are all degenerate, forming a macroscopic SO(5) multiplet. This\npaper discusses recent theoretical development on these electronic orders which\nare relevant to Pr$^{3+}$ and U$^{4+}$ systems with even number of $f$\nelectrons per site. In the superconducting order, each conduction-electron pair\nis coupled with local degrees of freedom, forming a composite entity with a\nstaggered spatial pattern. The quasi-particle spectrum is best interpreted as\nvirtual hybridization with resonant states at the Fermi level. Possible order\nparameter for URu$_2$Si$_2$ in the hidden order state is discussed in the\ncontext of composite orders. Briefly discussed are related issues such as\nhomogeneous odd-frequency pairing and SO(5) theory for high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n", "  The beginning of the application of the method of interacting configurations\nin the complex number representation to the compound atomic systems has been\npresented. The spectroscopic characteristics of the Be atom in the problem of\nthe electron-impact ionization of this atom are investigated. The energies and\nthe widths of the lowest autoionizing states of Be atom are calculated.\n", "  In this Master thesis we investigate the influence of pressure anisotropy and\nincompressible flow of arbitrary direction on the equilibrium properties of\nmagnetically confined, axisymmetric toroidal plasmas. The main novel\ncontribution is the derivation of a pertinent generalised Grad-Shafranov\nequation. This equation includes six free surface functions and recovers known\nGrad-Shafranov-like equations in the literature as well as the usual static,\nisotropic one. The form of the generalised equation indicates that pressure\nanisotropy and flow act additively on equilibrium. In addition, two sets of\nanalytical solutions, an extended Solovev one with a plasma reaching the\nseparatrix and an extended Hernegger-Maschke one for a plasma surrounded by a\nfixed boundary possessing an X-point, are constructed, particularly in\nrelevance to the ITER and NSTX tokamaks. Furthermore, the impacts both of\npressure anisotropy, through an anisotropy function assumed to be uniform on\nthe magnetic surfaces, and plasma flow, via the variation of an Alfvenic Mach\nfunction, on these equilibria are examined.\n  It turns out that depending on the maximum value and the shape of an\nanisotropy function, the anisotropy can act either paramagnetically or\ndiamagnetically. Also, in most of the cases considered both the anisotropy and\nthe flow have stronger effects on NSTX equilibria than on ITER ones. We\nconjecture that these effects may have an influence on plasma stability and\ntransport, and play a role in the transitions to the improved confinement\nregimes in tokamaks.\n", "  Multi-gap superconductors exhibit interesting properties. In an $N$-gap\nsuperconductor, we have in general $U(1)^N$ phase invariance. This\nmultiple-phase invariance is partially or totally spontaneously broken in a\nsuperconductor. The Nambu-Goldstone modes, as well as Higgs modes, are\nimportant and will play an important role in multi-condensate superconductors.\nThe additional phase invariance leads to a new quantum phase, with help of\nfrustrated Josephson effects, such as the time-reversal symmetry breaking, the\nemergence of massless modes and fractionally quantized-flux vortices. There is\na possibility that half-flux vortices exist in two-component superconductors in\na magnetic field. The half-quantum flux vortex can be interpreted as a\nmonopole, and two half-flux vortices form a bound state connected by a domain\nwall. There is an interesting analogy between quarks and fractionally\nquantized-flux vortices in superconductors.\n", "  Random matrices formed from i.i.d. standard real Gaussian entries have the\nfeature that the expected number of real eigenvalues is non-zero. This property\npersists for products of such matrices, independently chosen, and moreover it\nis known that as the number of matrices in the product tends to infinity, the\nprobability that all eigenvalues are real tends to unity. We quantify the\ndistribution of the number of real eigenvalues for products of finite size real\nGaussian matrices by giving an explicit Pfaffian formula for the probability\nthat there are exactly $k$ real eigenvalues as a determinant with entries\ninvolving particular Meijer G-functions. We also compute the explicit form of\nthe Pfaffian correlation kernel for the correlation between real eigenvalues,\nand the correlation between complex eigenvalues. The simplest example of these\n- the eigenvalue density of the real eigenvalues - gives by integration the\nexpected number of real eigenvalues. Our ability to perform these calculations\nrelies on the construction of certain skew-orthogonal polynomials in the\ncomplex plane, the computation of which is carried out using their relationship\nto particular random matrix averages.\n", "  To identify an analytical relation between the properties of polymers and\ntheir's monomer a Metal-Molecule-Metal (MMM) junction has been presented as an\ninteresting and widely used object of research in which the molecule is a\npolymer which is able to conduct charge. The method used in this study is based\non the Green's function approach in the tight-binding approximation using basic\nproperties of matrices. For a polymer base MMM system, transmission, density of\nstates (DOS) and local density of states (LDOS) have been calculated as a\nfunction of the hamiltonian of the monomer. After that, we have obtained a\nfrequency for LDOS variations in pass from a subunit to the next one which is a\nfunction of energy.\n", "  Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a wide bandgap van der Waals material that\nhas recently emerged as promising platform for quantum photonics experiments.\nIn this work we study the formation and localization of narrowband quantum\nemitters in large flakes (up to tens of microns wide) of hBN. The emitters can\nbe activated in as-grown hBN by electron irradiation or high temperature\nannealing, and the emitter formation probability can be increased by ion\nimplantation or focused laser irradiation of the as-grown material.\nInterestingly, we show that the emitters are always localized at edges of the\nflakes, unlike most luminescent point defects in 3D materials. Our results\nconstitute an important step on the road map of deploying hBN in nanophotonics\napplications.\n", "  We present an optical design of astronomic spectrograph based on a cascade of\nvolume-phase holographic gratings. The cascade consists of three gratings. Each\nof them provides moderately high spectral resolution in a narrow range of 83\nnm. Thus the spectrum image represents three lines covering region 430-680 nm.\nTwo versions of the scheme are described: a full-scale one with estimated\nresolving power of 5300-7900 and a small-sized one intended for creation of a\nlab prototype, which provides the resolving power of 1500-3000. Diffraction\nefficiency modeling confirms that the system throughput can reach 75 %, while\nstray light caused by the gratings crosstalk is negligible. We also propose a\ndesign of image slicer and focal reducer allowing to couple the instrument with\nthe 6-m telescope. Finally, we present concept of the opto-mechanical design.\n", "  Tip enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) amplifies the intensity of vibrational\nRaman scattering by employing the tip of a probe interacting, in ultra close\nproximity, with a surface. Although a general understanding of the TERS process\nis still to be fully elucidated, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) feedback\nis often applied with success in TERS to keep a noble metal probe in intimate\nproximity with a noble metal substrate. Since such STM TERS is a common\nmodality, the possible implications of plasmonic fields that may be induced by\nthe tunneling process are investigated and reported. In addition, TERS of a 2D\nresonant molecular system, a MoS2 bilayer crystal and a 2D non-resonant, lipid\nmolecular bilayer is compared. Data with multiple excitation wavelengths and\nsurfaces for the resonant system in the near- (TERS) and far-field regimes are\nreported. An interpretation based on weak coupling interactions within the\nframework of conventional resonance Raman scattering can explain the observed\nTERS enhancements. The non-resonant molecular lipid system, on the other hand,\nrequires strong coupling for a full understanding of the reported observations.\n", "  The giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect has been widely investigated on\nelectrodeposited ferromagnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers generally\ncontaining a large number of bilayers. In most applications of the GMR effect,\nlayered structures consisting of a relatively small number of consecutive FM\nand NM layers are used. It is of great interest, therefore, to investigate the\ninitial stages of GMR multilayer film growth by electrodeposition. In the\npresent work we have extended our previous studies on ED GMR multilayers to\nlayered structures with a total thickness ranging from a few nanometers up to\n70 nm. The evolution of the surface roughness and electrical transport\nproperties of such ultrathin ED Co/Cu layered structures was investigated.\nVarious layer combinations were produced including both Co and Cu either as\nstarting or top layers in order (i) to see differences in the nucleation of the\nfirst layer and (ii) to trace out the effect of the so called exchange\nreaction. Special attention was paid to measure the field dependence of the\nmagnetoresistance, MR(H) in order to derive information for the appearance of\nsuperparamagnetic regions in the magnetic layers. This proved to be helpful for\nmonitoring the evolution of the layer microstructure at each step of the\ndeposition sequence.\n", "  We present a formulation of the decoherent (or consistent) histories quantum\ntheory of closed systems starting with records of what histories happen.\nAlternative routes to a formulation of quantum theory like this one can be\nuseful both for understanding quantum mechanics and for generalizing and\nextending it to new realms of application and experimental test.\n", "  We address Gillis' recent criticism [arXiv:1506.05795] of a series of papers\n(by different combinations of the present authors) on formulations of Bell's\ntheorem. Those papers intended to address an unfortunate gap of communication\nbetween two broad camps in the quantum foundations community that we identify\nas \"operationalists\" and \"realists\". Here, we once again urge the readers to\napproach the question from an unbiased standpoint, and explain that Gillis'\ncriticism draws too heavily on the philosophical inclinations of one side of\nthat debate -- the realist camp. As part of that explanation we discuss\nintuition versus proof, look again at Bell's formalizations of locality, and\ncorrect misstatements by Gillis of our views, and those of Bell and Einstein.\n", "  In this work, we present a semi-numerical solution of a fractal telegraphic\ndual-porosity fluid flow model. It combines Laplace transform and finite\ndifference schemes. The Laplace transform handles the time variable whereas the\nfinite difference method deals with the spatial coordinate. This semi-numerical\nscheme is not restricted by space discretization and allows the computation of\na solution at any time without compromising numerical stability or the mass\nconservation principle. Our formulation results in a non-analytically-solvable\nsecond-order differential equation whose numerical treatment outcomes in a\ntri-diagonal linear algebraic system. Moreover, we describe comparisons between\nsemi-numerical and semi-analytical solutions for particular cases. Results\nagree well with those from semi-analytic solutions. Furthermore, we expose a\nparametric analysis from the coupled model in order to show the effects of\nrelevant parameters on pressure profiles and flow rates for the case where\nneither analytic nor semi-analytic solutions are available.\n", "  We report our measurements for orbital and spin parameters of X 1822-371\nusing its X-ray partial eclipsing profile and pulsar timing from data collected\nby the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Four more X-ray eclipse times\nobtained by the RXTE 2011 observations were combined with historical records to\ntrace evolution of orbital period. We found that a cubic ephemeris likely\nbetter describes evolution of the X-ray eclipse times during a time span of\nabout 34 years with a marginal second order derivative of\n$\\ddot{P}_{orb}=(-1.05 \\pm 0.59) \\times 10^{-19}$ s$^{-1}$. Using the pulse\narrival time delay technique, the orbital and spin parameters were obtained\nfrom RXTE observations from 1998 to 2011. The detected pulse periods show that\nthe neutron star in X 1822-371 is continuously spun-up with a rate of\n$\\dot{P}_{s}=(-2.6288 \\pm 0.0095) \\times 10^{-12}$ s s$^{-1}$. Evolution of the\nepoch of the mean longitude $l=\\pi /2$ (i.e. $T_{\\pi / 2}$) gives an orbital\nperiod derivative value consistent with that obtained from the quadratic\nephemeris evaluated by the X-ray eclipse but the detected $T_{\\pi / 2}$ values\nare significantly and systematically earlier than the corresponding expected\nX-ray eclipse times by $90 \\pm 11$ s. This deviation is probably caused by\nasymmetric X-ray emissions. We also attempted to constrain the mass and radius\nof the neutron star using the spin period change rate and concluded that the\nintrinsic luminosity of X 1822-371 is likely more than $10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.\n", "  This paper is dedicated to the discovery of one of the most important\nrelationships in supernova cosmology - the relation between the peak luminosity\nof Type Ia supernovae and their luminosity decline rate after maximum light.\nThe history of this relationship is quite long and interesting. The\nrelationship was independently discovered by the American statistician and\nastronomer Bert Woodard Rust and the Soviet astronomer Yury Pavlovich Pskovskii\nin the 1970s. Using a limited sample of Type I supernovae they were able to\nshow that the brighter the supernova is, the slower its luminosity declines\nafter maximum. Only with the appearance of CCD cameras could Mark Phillips\nre-inspect this relationship on a new level of accuracy using a better sample\nof supernovae. His investigations confirmed the idea proposed earlier by Rust\nand Pskovskii.\n", "  Molecular models of real fluids are validated by comparing the vapor-liquid\nsurface tension from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to correlations of\nexperimental data. The considered molecular models consist of up to 28\ninteraction sites, including Lennard-Jones sites, point charges, dipoles and\nquadrupoles. They represent 38 real fluids, such as ethylene oxide, sulfur\ndioxide, phosgene, benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde, methanol and water, and were\nadjusted to reproduce the saturated liquid density, vapor pressure and enthalpy\nof vaporization. The models were not adjusted to interfacial properties,\nhowever, so that the present MD simulations are a test of model predictions. It\nis found that all of the considered models overestimate the surface tension. In\nmost cases, however, the relative deviation between the simulation results and\ncorrelations to experimental data is smaller than 20 %. This observation\ncorroborates the outcome of our previous studies on the surface tension of\n2CLJQ and 2CLJD fluids where an overestimation of the order of 10 to 20 % was\nfound.\n", "  The Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) in Chinese Spallation Neutron Source\n(CSNS) accelerates proton beam from 80Mev to 1.6GeV at a repetition rate of\n25Hz. All dipole magnets of RCS are operated at AC with biased DC. Aiming at\nthe properties of these dipole magnets, we take some methods to improve\nmagnetic field quality in the good region and reduce eddy currents in the iron\ncore . In this paper, we would present the process of the magnet design and\ntemperature rise calculation. At the same time, the field measurement results\nand temperature test of the prototype magnet are also described and discussed.\n", "  Parton Reggeization approach is the scheme of kT-factorization for multiscale\nhard processes, which is based on the Lipatov's gauge invariant effective field\ntheory (EFT) for high energy processes in QCD. The new type of rapidity\ndivergences, associated with the log 1/x-corrections, appears in the loop\ncorrections in this formalism. The covariant procedure of regularization of\nrapidity divergences, preserving the gauge invariance of effective action is\ndescribed. As an example application, the one-loop correction to the propagator\nof Reggeized quark and gamma Q q -scattering vertex are computed. Obtained\nresults are used to construct the Regge limit of one-loop gamma+gamma -> q +\nbarq amplitude. The cancelation of rapidity divergences and consistency of the\nEFT prediction with the full QCD result is demonstrated. The rapidity\nrenormalization group within the EFT is discussed.\n", "  We present an individual based model of cultural evolution, where interacting\nagents are coded by binary strings standing for strategies for action,\nblueprints for products or attitudes and beliefs. The model is patterned on an\nestablished model of biological evolution, the Tangled Nature Model (TNM),\nwhere a `tangle' of interactions between agents determines their reproductive\nsuccess. In addition, our agents also have the ability to copy part of each\nother's strategy, a feature inspired by the Axelrod model of cultural\ndiversity. Unlike the latter, but similarly to the TNM, the model dynamics goes\nthrough a series of metastable stages of increasing length, each characterized\nby mutually enforcing cultural patterns. These patterns are abruptly replaced\nby other patterns characteristic of the next metastable period. We analyze the\ntime dependence of the population and diversity in the system, show how\ndifferent cultures are formed and merge, and how their survival probability\nlacks, in the model, a finite average life-time. Finally, we use historical\ndata on the number of car manufacturers after the introduction of the\nautomobile to the market, to argue that ourmodel can qualitatively reproduce\nthe flurry of cultural activity which follows a disruptive innovation.\n", "  We consider a double OPE limit of the planar four-point function of stress\ntensor multiplets in N = 4 SYM theory. Loop integrands for this correlator have\nbeen constructed to very high order, but the corresponding integrals are\nexplicitly known only up to three loops. Fortunately, the double coincidence\nlimit of the four-loop integrals can be found by the method of expansion by\nregions, which reduces the problem of computing the four-point integrals to the\nevaluation of a large set of massless propagator integrals. These can in turn\nbe evaluated by IBP reduction.\n  The OPE limit of the stress tensor four-point function allows us to extract\nthe (square of the) three-point couplings between two stress tensor multiplets\nand one twist two operator in the 20' of SU(4). The latest available IBP\nsoftware accomplishes this task up to and including spin 8. With the data\nobtained we hope to further the development of the recent integrable systems\npicture for correlation functions.\n", "  We report the discovery of two transiting planetary systems: a super dense,\nsub-Jupiter mass planet WASP-86b (\\mpl\\ = 0.82 $\\pm$ 0.06 \\mj, \\rpl\\ = 0.63\n$\\pm$ 0.01 \\rj), and a bloated, Saturn-like planet WASP-102b (\\mpl\\ = 0.62\n$\\pm$ 0.04 \\mj, \\rpl\\=1.27 $\\pm$ 0.03 \\rj). They orbit their host star every\n$\\sim$5.03, and $\\sim$2.71 days, respectively. The planet hosting WASP-86 is a\nF7 star (\\teff\\ = 6330$\\pm$110 K, \\feh\\ = $+$0.23 $\\pm$ 0.14 dex, and age\n$\\sim$0.8--1~Gyr), WASP-102 is a G0 star (\\teff\\ = 5940$\\pm$140 K, \\feh\\ =\n$-$0.09$\\pm$ 0.19 dex, and age $\\sim$1~Gyr). These two systems highlight the\ndiversity of planetary radii over similar masses for giant planets with masses\nbetween Saturn and Jupiter. WASP-102b shows a larger than model-predicted\nradius, indicating that the planet is receiving a strong incident flux which\ncontributes to the inflation of its radius. On the other hand, with a density\nof $\\rho_{pl}$ = 3.24$\\pm$~0.3~$\\rho_{jup}$, WASP-86b is the densest gas giant\nplanet among planets with masses in the range 0.05 $<M$_{pl}$<$ 2.0 \\mj. With a\nstellar mass of 1.34 M$_{\\odot}$ and \\feh = $+$0.23 dex, WASP-86 could host\nadditional massive and dense planets given that its protoplanetary disc is\nexpected to also have been enriched with heavy elements. In order to match\nWASP-86b's density, an extrapolation of theoretical models predicts a planet\ncomposition of more than 80\\% in heavy elements (whether confined in a core or\nmixed in the envelope). This fraction corresponds to a core mass of\napproximately 210\\me\\ for WASP-86b's mass of \\mpl$\\sim$260\\,\\me. Only planets\nwith masses larger than about 2\\mj\\ have larger densities than that of\nWASP-86b, making it exceptional in its mass range.\n", "  We observe experimentally a mode-locking in a continuous narrow-band tunable\ndye laser with molecular iodine absorber cells, which transitions have large\nphase relaxation time T2. We show that the mode-locking arises due to coherent\ninteraction of light with the absorbing medium leading to Rabi oscillations, so\nthat zero-area (0{\\pi}-) pulses in the absorber are formed. Such mode-locking\nregime is different to most typical passive modelocking mechanisms where\nsaturation plays the main role.\n", "  Here we show that noisy coupling can lead to diffusive lossless energy\ntransfer between individual quantum systems retaining a quantum character\nleading to entangled stationary states. Coherence might flow diffusively while\nbeing summarily preserved even when energy exchange is absent. Diffusive\ndynamics persists even in the case when additional noise suppresses all the\nunitary excitation exchange: arbitrarily strong local dephasing, while\ndestroying quantum correlations, is not affecting energy transfer.\n", "  We describe the theory and present numerical evidence for a new type of\nnonlinear resonant interaction between gravity waves on the surface of deep\nwater. The resonance constitutes a generalisation of the usual 'exact'\nresonance as we show that exchanges of energy between the waves can be enhanced\nwhen the interaction is three-wave rather than four and the linear frequency\nmismatch, or detuning, is non-zero i.e. $\\omega_1\\pm\\omega_2\\pm\\omega_3 \\neq0.$\nThis is possible because the resonance condition is now a match between the\nso-called 'precession frequency' of a given $\\textit{triad interaction}$ and an\nexistent nonlinear frequency in the system. In the limit of weak nonlinearity\nthis precession frequency is simply due to the linear 'drift' of the triad\nphase; therefore, it tends toward the detuning. This means precession resonance\nof this type can occur at finite amplitudes, with nonlinear corrections\ncontributing to the resonance. We report energy transfer efficiencies of up to\n40%, depending on the model options. To the authors' knowledge this represents\nthe first new type of nonlinear resonance in surface gravity waves since the\nseminal work of Benjamin & Feir (1967).\n", "  Without breaking Lorentz invariance, we investigate the speed of graviton in\nevent GW150914 by using the modified dispersion relation from gravity's\nrainbow. The proper range of the parameter in the modified dispersion relation\nis determined by taking into account the gap between the speed of the graviton\nand that obtained from event GW150914.\n", "  Cosmic ray electrons represent a background for gamma-ray observations with\nCherenkov telescopes, initiating air-showers which are difficult to distinguish\nfrom photon-initiated showers. This similarity, however, and the presence of\ncosmic ray electrons in every field observed, makes them potentially very\nuseful for calibration purposes. Here we study the precision with which the\nrelative energy scale and collection area/efficiency for photons can be\nestablished using electrons for a major next generation instrument such as CTA.\nWe find that variations in collection efficiency on hour timescales can be\ncorrected to better than 1%. Furthermore, the break in the electron spectrum at\n~0.9 TeV can be used to calibrate the energy scale at the 3% level on the same\ntimescale. For observations on the order of hours, statistical errors become\nnegligible below a few TeV and allow for an energy scale cross-check with\ninstruments such as CALET and AMS. Cosmic ray electrons therefore provide a\npowerful calibration tool, either as an alternative to intensive atmospheric\nmonitoring and modelling efforts, or for independent verification of such\nprocedures.\n", "  The electron beam dynamics in a nonmagnetized high-current vacuum diode is\nanalyzed for different cathode-anode gap geometries. The conditions enabling to\nachieve the minimal {initial} momentum spread in the electron beam are found\nout. A drastic rise of current density in a vacuum diode with a ring-type\ncathode is described. The effect is shown to be caused by electrostatic\nrepulsion.\n", "  Electron spins in semiconductors are promising qubits because their long\ncoherence times enable nearly 10^9 coherent quantum gate operations. However,\ndeveloping a scalable high-fidelity two-qubit gate remains challenging. Here,\nwe demonstrate an entangling gate between two double-quantum-dot spin qubits in\nGaAs by using a magnetic field gradient between the two dots in each qubit to\nsuppress decoherence due to charge noise. When the magnetic gradient dominates\nthe voltage-controlled exchange interaction between electrons, qubit coherence\ntimes increase by an order of magnitude. Using randomized benchmarking and\nself-consistent quantum measurement, state, and process tomography, we measure\nsingle-qubit gate fidelities of approximately 99% and an entangling gate\nfidelity of 90%. In the future, operating double quantum dot spin qubits with\nlarge gradients in nuclear-spin-free materials, such as Si, should enable a\ntwo-qubit gate fidelity surpassing the threshold for fault-tolerant quantum\ninformation processing.\n", "  We demonstrate the continuous and reversible tuning of the optical band gap\nof suspended monolayer MoS2 membranes by as much as 500 meV by applying very\nlarge biaxial strains. By using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to grow\ncrystals that are highly impermeable to gas, we are able to apply a pressure\ndifference across suspended membranes to induce biaxial strains. We observe the\neffect of strain on the energy and intensity of the peaks in the\nphotoluminescence (PL) spectrum, and find a linear tuning rate of the optical\nband gap of 99 meV/%. This method is then used to study the PL spectra of\nbilayer and trilayer devices under strain, and to find the shift rates and\nGr\\\"uneisen parameters of two Raman modes in monolayer MoS2. Finally, we use\nthis result to show that we can apply biaxial strains as large as 5.6% across\nmicron sized areas, and report evidence for the strain tuning of higher level\noptical transitions.\n", "  The account of electron correlation and its efficient separation into dynamic\nand nondynamic parts plays a key role in the development of computational\nmethods. In this paper we suggest a physically-sound matrix formulation to\nsplit electron correlation into dynamic and nondynamic parts using the\ntwo-particle cumulant matrix and a measure of the deviation from idempotency of\nthe first-order density matrix. These matrices are applied to a two-electron\nmodel, giving rise to a simplified electron correlation index that ($i$)\ndepends only on natural orbitals and their occupancies, ($ii$) can be\nstraightforwardly decomposed into orbital contributions and ($iii$) splits into\ndynamic and nondynamic correlation parts that ($iv$) admit a local version.\nThese expressions are shown to account for dynamic and nondynamic correlation\nin a variety of systems containing different electron correlation regimes, thus\nproviding the first separation of dynamic and nondynamic correlation using\nsolely natural orbital occupancies.\n", "  A model of nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with the gravitational field is\nstudied. We obtain the asymptotic black hole solutions at $r\\rightarrow 0$ and\n$r\\rightarrow \\infty$. The asymptotic at $r\\rightarrow 0$ is shown, and we find\ncorrections to the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution and Coulomb's law at\n$r\\rightarrow\\infty$. The mass of the black hole is evaluated having the\nelectromagnetic origin. We investigate the thermodynamics of charged black\nholes and their thermal stability. The critical point corresponding to the\nsecond-order phase transition (where heat capacity diverges) is found. If the\nmass of the black hole is greater than the critical mass, the black hole\nbecomes unstable.\n", "  High resolution and high throughput imaging are typically mutually exclusive.\nThe meta-instrument pairs high resolution optical concepts such as\nnano-antennas, superoscillatory lenses and hyperlenses with a miniaturized\nopto-mechatronic platform for precise and high speed positioning of the optical\nelements at lens-to-sample separations that are measured in tens of nanometers.\nSuch platform is a necessary development for bringing near-field optical\nimaging techniques to their industrial application. Towards this purpose, we\npresent two designs and proof-of-principle instruments that are aimed at\nrealizing sub-nanometer positional precision with a 100 kHz bandwidth.\n", "  It is shown that the Hawking radiation and staying at the Schwarzschild state\nare not consistent for black holes as graviton balls. The only exception is the\neternal black hole.\n", "  The recent observation of gravitational waves, stimulates the question of the\nlongtime evolution of the space-time fluctuations. Gravitational waves interact\nthemselves through the nonlinear character of Einstein's equations of general\nrelativity. This nonlinear wave interaction allows the spectral energy transfer\nfrom mode to mode. According to the wave turbulence theory, the weakly\nnonlinear interaction of gravitational waves leads to the existence of an\nirreversible kinetic regime that dominates the longtime evolution. The\nresulting kinetic equation suggests the existence of an equilibrium wave\nspectrum and the existence of a non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum\nfor spatio-temporal fluctuations. Evidence of these solutions extracted in the\nfluctuating signal of the recent observations will be discussed in the paper.\nProbably, the present results would be pertinent in the new age of development\nof gravitational astronomy, as well as, in new tests of General Relativity.\n", "  Partonic matter produced in the early stage of ultrarelativistic\nnucleus-nucleus collisions is assumed to be composed mainly of gluons, and\nquarks and antiquarks are produced at later times. The comparable hydrodynamic\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions for (2+1)-flavor and Yang-Mills equations\nof state performed by using three different hydrodynamic codes are presented.\nAssuming slow chemical equilibration of quarks, the spectra and elliptic flows\nof thermal dileptons and photons are calculated for central Pb+Pb collisions at\nthe LHC energy of $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV. It is shown that a\nsuppression of quarks at early times leads to a significant reduction of the\nyield of the thermal dileptons, but only to a rather modest suppression of the\n$p_T$-distribution of direct photons. It is demonstrated that an enhancement of\nphoton and dilepton elliptic flows might serve as a promising signature of the\npure-glue initial state. Calculations based on Bjorken hydrodynamics suggest\nthat collisions of small systems at intermediate energies available at RHIC or\nfuture FAIR facilities may show stronger effects associated with initial pure\ngluodynamic evolution.\n", "  HgCdTe detector arrays with a cutoff wavelength of ~10 ${\\mu}$m intended for\nthe NEOCam space mission were subjected to proton beam irradiation at the\nUniversity of California Davis Crocker Nuclear Laboratory. Three arrays were\ntested - one with 800 $\\mu$m substrate intact, one with 30 $\\mu$m substrate,\nand one completely substrate-removed. The CdZnTe substrate, on which the HgCdTe\ndetector is grown, has been shown to produce luminescence in shorter wave\nHgCdTe arrays that causes elevated signal in non-hit pixels when subjected to\nproton irradiation. This testing was conducted to ascertain whether or not full\nsubstrate removal is necessary. At the dark level of the dewar, we detect no\nluminescence in non-hit pixels during proton testing for both the\nsubstrate-removed detector array and the array with 30 ${\\mu}$m substrate. The\ndetector array with full 800 ${\\mu}$m substrate exhibited substantial\nphotocurrent for a flux of 103 protons/cm$^2$-s at a beam energy of 18.1 MeV (~\n750 e$^-$/s) and 34.4 MeV ($\\sim$ 65 e$^-$/s). For the integrated space-like\nambient proton flux level measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the\nluminescence would be well below the NEOCam dark current requirement of <200\ne$^-$/s, but the pattern of luminescence could be problematic, possibly\ncomplicating calibration.\n", "  Soap bubbles occupy the rare position of delighting and fascinating both\nyoung children and scientific minds alike. Sir Isaac Newton, Joseph Plateau,\nCarlo Marangoni, and Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, not to mention countless others,\nhave discovered remarkable results in optics, molecular forces and fluid\ndynamics from investigating this seemingly simple system. We present here a\ncompilation of curiosity-driven experiments that systematically investigate the\nsurface flows on a rising soap bubble. From childhood experience, we are\nfamiliar with the vibrant colors and mesmerizing display of chaotic flows on\nthe surface of a soap bubble. These flows arise due to surface tension\ngradients, also known as Marangoni flows or instabilities. In Figure 1, we show\nthe surprising effect of layering multiple instabilities on top of each other,\nhighlighting that unexpected new phenomena are still waiting to be discovered,\neven in the simple soap bubble.\n", "  Intracellular transport is essential for maintaining proper cellular function\nin most eukaryotic cells, with perturbations in active transport resulting in\nseveral types of disease. Efficient delivery of critical cargos to specific\nlocations is accomplished through a combination of passive diffusion and active\ntransport by molecular motors that ballistically move along a network of\ncytoskeletal filaments. Although motor-based transport is known to be necessary\nto overcome cytoplasmic crowding and the limited range of diffusion within\nreasonable time scales, the topological features of the cytoskeletal network\nthat regulate transport efficiency and robustness have not been established.\nUsing a continuum diffusion model, we observed that the time required for\ncellular transport was minimized when the network was localized near the\nnucleus. In simulations that explicitly incorporated network spatial\narchitectures, total filament mass was the primary driver of network transit\ntimes. However, filament traps that redirect cargo back to the nucleus caused\nlarge variations in network transport. Filament polarity was more important\nthan filament orientation in reducing average transit times, and transport\nproperties were optimized in networks with intermediate motor on and off rates.\nOur results provide important insights into the functional constraints on\nintracellular transport under which cells have evolved cytoskeletal structures,\nand have potential applications for enhancing reactions in biomimetic systems\nthrough rational transport network design.\n", "  The importance of accurate simulation of the plastic deformation of ductile\nmetals to the design of structures and components is well-known. Many\ntechniques exist that address the length scales relevant to deformation pro-\ncesses, including dislocation dynamics (DD), which models the interaction and\nevolution of discrete dislocation line segments, and crystal plasticity (CP),\nwhich incorporates the crystalline nature and restricted motion of dis-\nlocations into a higher scale continuous field framework. While these two\nmethods are conceptually related, there have been only nominal efforts focused\non the system-level material response that use DD-generated information to\nenhance the fidelity of plasticity models. To ascertain to what degree the\npredictions of CP are consistent with those of DD, we compare their global and\nmicrostructural response in a number of deformation modes. After using\nnominally homogeneous compression and shear deformation dislocation dynamics\nsimulations to calibrate crystal plasticity flow rule parameters, we compare\nnot only the system-level stress-strain response of prismatic wires in torsion\nbut also the resulting geometrically necessary dislocation density fields. To\nestablish a connection between explicit description of dislocations and the\ncontinuum assumed with crystal plasticity simulations, we ascertain the minimum\nlength-scale at which meaningful dislocation density fields appear. Our results\nshow that, for the case of torsion, the two material models can produce\ncomparable spatial dislocation density distributions.\n", "  New generation radio interferometers encode signals from thousands of antenna\nfeeds across large bandwidth. Channelizing and correlating this data requires\nnetworking capabilities that can handle unprecedented data rates with\nreasonable cost. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)\ncorrelator processes 8-bits from N=2048 digitizer inputs across 400~MHz of\nbandwidth. Measured in $N^2~\\times $ bandwidth, it is the largest radio\ncorrelator that has been built. Its digital back-end must exchange and\nreorganize the 6.6~terabit/s produced by its 128 digitizing and channelizing\nnodes, and feed it to the 256-node spatial correlator in a way that each node\nobtains data from all digitizer inputs but across a small fraction of the\nbandwidth (i.e. `corner-turn'). In order to maximize performance and\nreliability of the corner-turn system while minimizing cost, a custom\nnetworking solution has been implemented. The system makes use of Field\nProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA) transceivers to implement direct, passive,\nfull-mesh, high speed serial connections between sixteen circuit boards in a\ncrate, to exchange data between crates, and to offload the data to a cluster of\n256 graphics processing unit (GPU) nodes using standard 10~Gbit/s Ethernet\nlinks. The GPU nodes complete the corner-turn by combining data from all crates\nand then computing visibilities. Eye diagrams and frame error counters confirm\nerror-free operation of the corner-turn network in both the currently operating\nCHIME Pathfinder telescope (a prototype for the full CHIME telescope) and a\nrepresentative fraction of the full CHIME hardware providing an end-to-end\nsystem validation.\n  An analysis of an equivalent corner-turn system built with Ethernet switches\ninstead of custom passive data links is provided.\n", "  The equation of state (EoS) of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at zero\ntemperature can be calculated in two different perturbative regimes: for small\nvalues of the baryon chemical potential $\\mu$, one may use chiral perturbation\ntheory (ChEFT); and for large values of $\\mu$, one may use perturbative QCD\n(pQCD). There is, however, a gap for $\\mu \\in (0.97\\text{ GeV},\\, 2.6\\text{\nGeV})$, where these theories becomes non-perturbative, and where there is\ncurrently no known microscopic description of QCD matter. Unfortunately, this\ninterval obscures the values of $\\mu$ found within the cores of neutron stars\n(NSs).\n  In this thesis, we argue that thermodynamic matching of the ChEFT and pQCD\nEoSs is a legitimate way to obtain quantitative constraints on the\nnon-pertubative QCD EoS. Moreover, we argue that this method is effective,\nverifiable, and systematically improvable. First, we carry out a simplified\nmatching procedure in QCD-like theories that can be simulated on the lattice\nwithout a sign problem. Our calculated pressure band serves as a prediction for\nlattice-QCD practitioners and will allow them to verify or refute the\nsimplified procedure. Second, we apply the state-of-the-art matched EoS of\nKurkela et al. (2014) to rotating NSs. This allows us to obtain bounds on\nobservable NS properties, as well as point towards future observations that\nwould more tightly constrain the current state-of-the-art EoS band. Finally, as\nevidence of the ability to improve the procedure, we carry out calculations in\npQCD to improve the zero-temperature pressure. We calculate the full\n$\\mathcal{O}(g^{6} \\ln^{2} g)$ contribution to the pQCD pressure for $n_{f}$\nmassless quarks, as well as a significant portion of the $\\mathcal{O}(g^{6} \\ln\ng)$ piece and even some of the $\\mathcal{O}(g^{6})$ piece.\n", "  Remote sensing with phased antenna arrays is based on measurement of the\ncross-correlations between the signals from each antenna pair. Digital\ncorrelators have systematic errors due to the quantization losses. The\ncorrelation errors allow substantial abatement based on the assumption that the\nanalog signals are stochastic processes sampled from a statistical distribution\n(usually the Gaussian). The correlation correction technique is named after Van\nVleck who was the first to apply it to two-level clipping quantizers. The\ncorrection is especially important for high correlation levels, e.g. in studies\nof solar radio emissions. We offer a generalized method that for every antenna\npair inputs the quantized signals' covariance and standard deviations, and\noutputs high-precision estimates of the analog correlation. Although\ncorrelation correction methods have been extensively investigated in the past,\nthere are several problems that, as far as we know, have not been published\nyet. We consider a very general quantization scheme with arbitrary set of\ntransition thresholds and output levels, and our correction method is designed\nfor correlations obtained from signals with generally unequal standard\ndeviations. We also provide a method for estimation of the analog standard\ndeviation from the quantized one for subsequent use in the correlation\ncorrection. We apply the correction to the the complex-valued analytic signals,\noverwhelmingly used in modern remote sensing systems with arrays of antennas.\nThe approach is valid not only for analytic signals with the imaginary part\nbeing the Hilbert transform of the real one, but also for more general,\ncircularly symmetric complex processes whose real and imaginary parts may have\narbitrary relationships to each other. This work was motivated by the need for\ngreater precision in analysis of data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n", "  We study the prospects for constraining the Higgs boson's couplings to up and\ndown quarks using kinematic distributions in Higgs production at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider. We find that the Higgs $p_T$ distribution can be used to\nconstrain these couplings with precision competitive to other proposed\ntechniques. With 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of data at 13 TeV in the four-lepton decay\nchannel, we find $-0.73 \\lesssim \\bar{\\kappa}_u \\lesssim 0.33$ and $-0.88\n\\lesssim \\bar{\\kappa}_d \\lesssim 0.32$, where $\\bar{\\kappa}_q = (m_q/m_b)\n\\kappa_q$ is a scaling factor that modifies the $q$ quark Yukawa coupling\nrelative to the Standard Model bottom quark Yukawa coupling. The sensitivity\nmay be improved by including additional Higgs decay channels.\n", "  The phase diagrams and transitions of nonequilibrium systems with\nmultiplicative noise are studied theoretically. We show the existence of both\nstrong and weak-coupling critical behavior, of two distinct active phases, and\nof a nonzero range of parameter values over which the susceptibility is\ninfinite in any dimension. A scaling theory of the strong-coupling transition\nis constructed.\n", "  We show that certain critical exponents of systems with multiplicative noise\ncan be obtained from exponents of the KPZ equation. Numerical simulations in 1d\nconfirm this prediction, and yield other exponents of the multiplicative noise\nproblem. The numerics also verify an earlier prediction of the divergence of\nthe susceptibility over an entire range of control parameter values, and show\nthat the exponent governing the divergence in this range varies continuously\nwith control parameter.\n", "  We propose a power filter Gp for linear reconstruction of the CMB signal from\nobservational maps. This Gp filter preserves the power spectrum of the CMB\nsignal in contrast to the Wiener filter which diminishes the power spectrum of\nthe reconstructed CMB signal. We demonstrate how peak statistics and a cluster\nanalysis can be used to estimate the probability of the presence of a CMB\nsignal in observational records. The efficiency of the Gp filter is\ndemonstrated on a toy model of an observational record consisting of a CMB\nsignal and noise in the form of foreground point sources.\n", "  The relation between the X-ray emission, the infrared emission and the\ncoronal line emission in a sample of the brightest known Seyfert galaxies is\nanalyzed. A close relationship between the absorption-corrected soft X-ray\nemission and both the mid-infrared and the coronal line emission is found among\nthe Seyfert type 2 objects studied in this work. Being both the coronal line\nand the X-ray emissions main tracers of the AGN activity, their relation with\nthe mid-infrared emission adds further support to the claim that the\nmid-infrared emission is primarily due to dust heated directly by the central\nAGN. No apparent relationship between the soft X-ray emission and the coronal\nline and/or the mid-infrared emissions is seen within Seyfert 1 objects, the\nnumber of objects of this class in the sample is comparatively smaller though.\nThat discrepancy is partially due to the fact that the soft X-ray emission in\nthe Seyfert 1s is systematically larger by at least one order of magnitude than\nthat in their Seyfert 2 counterparts. Finally, the hard X-ray emission in both\nSeyfert types shows unrelated to the mid-infrared and coronal line emissions.\n", "  We have developed a method to calculate the fundamental parameters of the\nvertical structure of the Galaxy in the solar neighborhood from trigonometric\nparallaxes alone. The method takes into account Lutz-Kelker-type biases in a\nself-consistent way and has been applied to a sample of O-B5 stars obtained\nfrom the Hipparcos catalog. We find that the Sun is located 24.2 +/- 1.7\n(random) +/- 0.4 (systematic) pc above the galactic plane and that the disk\nO-B5 stellar population is distributed with a scale height of 34.2 +/- 0.8\n(random) +/- 2.5 (systematic) pc and an integrated surface density of (1.62 +/-\n0.04 (random) +/- 0.14 (systematic)) 10^{-3} stars pc^{-2}. A halo component is\nalso detected in the distribution and constitutes at least ~5% of the total\nO-B5 population. The O-B5 stellar population within ~100 pc of the Sun has an\nanomalous spatial distribution, with a less-than-average number density. This\nlocal disturbance is probably associated with the expansion of Gould's belt.\n", "  Next-to-leading order expressions related to Stewart-Lyth inverse problem are\nused to determine the inflationary models with a tensorial power spectrum\ndescribed by a scale-invariant spectral index. Beyond power-law inflation,\nsolutions are characterized by scale dependent scalar indices. These models can\nbe used as assumption on the generation of primordial perturbations to test for\nscale dependence of the scalar index at large angular scales. If such a\ndependence is detected, a nonzero contribution of gravitational waves to the\nCMB spectrum must be expected.\n", "  We review recent studies on the morphology and distribution with respect to\nthe galactic plane of planetary nebulae (PNs), as well as recent advances in\nMHD modeling of PNs. We discuss a tentative explanation for the connection\nbetween morphological classes and their galactic distribution\n", "  This paper reports results on the statistical analysis of HI turbulence in\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We use 21 cm channel maps, obtained with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array and the Parkes telescope, and analyze the\nspectrum of observed intensity fluctuations as a function of the velocity slice\nthickness. We confirm predictions by Lazarian & Pogosyan (2000) on the change\nof the power law index and establish the spectra of 3-D density and velocity.\nThe obtained spectral indices, -3.3 and -3.4, are slightly more shallow than\nthe predictions for the Kolmogorov spectrum. This contrasts to the predictions\nfor the shock-type spectra that are steeper than the Kolmogorov one. The nature\nof the energy injection in the SMC is unclear as no distinct energy injection\nscales are observed up to the entire scale of the SMC.\n", "  Detailed atmospheric abundances have been calculated for a sample of A-G\nsupergiant stars with IR fluxes and/or high galactic latitudes. HD 172481 and\nHD 158616 show clear indications of being post-AGB stars that have experienced\nthird dredge-up. HD 158616 is carbon-rich while the abundance pattern of HD\n172481 and its large Li enhancement gives support to the hot bottom burning\nscenario that explains paucity of carbon-rich stars among AGB stars. HD 172324\nis very likely a hot post-AGB star that shows a strong carbon deficiency. HD\n725, HD 218753 and HD 331319 also appear to be evolved objects between the red\ngiant and the AGB. HD 9167, HD 173638 with a few exceptions, reflect solar\nabundances and no signs of post red giant evolution. They are most likely young\nmassive disk supergiants. Further analysis of proto-Planetary Nebula HDE 341617\nreveals that He lines show signs of velocity stratification. The emission lines\nhave weakened considerably since 1993. The envelope expands at 19 km s$^{-1}$\nrelative to the star. Atmospheric abundances, evolutionary tracks and\nisochrones are used to estimate masses and ages of all stars in the sample.\n", "  ESA has identified interferometry as one of the major goals of the Horizon\n2000+ programme. Infrared interferometers are a highly sensitive astronomical\ninstruments that enable us to observe terrestrial planets around nearby stars.\nIn this context the Infrared Space Interferometry Mission (IRSI)/ DARWIN is\nstudied. The current design calls for a constellation of 6 free flying\ntelescopes using 1.5m mirrors, plus one hub and one master spacecraft. As the\nbaseline trajectory an orbit about the second collinear libration point of the\nEarth-Sun system has been selected. The thermal radiation from the\ninterplanetary dust cloud that surrounds the Sun, the so-called zodiacal\ninfrared foreground, is a major concern for any high-sensitivity infrared\nmission. The most reliable information about this radiation comes from the\nmeasurements by NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. There are\nvarious ways to detect faint terrestrial planets despite the bright foreground.\nWe find that, using integration times in the order of 30h, the baseline mission\nscenario is capable of detecting earth-sized exo-planets out to 14pc. We seize\nthe suggestion that increasing the heliocentric distance of the instrument\nwould make the observing conditions even better. A dust model that was fitted\nto the COBE measurements shows that an observing location of DARWIN in the\nouter solar system would potentially reduce the zodiacal foreground by a factor\nof 100, effectively increasing the number of potential target stars by almost a\nfactor of 30.\n", "  Planets orbiting a planetesimal circumstellar disc can migrate inward from\ntheir initial positions because of dynamical friction between planets and\nplanetesimals. The migration rate depends on the disc mass and on its time\nevolution. Planets that are embedded in long-lived planetesimal discs, having\ntotal mass of $10^{-4}-0.01 M_{\\odot}$, can migrate inward a large distance and\ncan survive only if the inner disc is truncated or because of tidal interaction\nwith the star. In this case the semi-major axis, a, of the planetary orbit is\nless than 0.1 AU. Orbits with larger $a$ are obtained for smaller value of the\ndisc mass or for a rapid evolution (depletion) of the disc. This model may\nexplain several of the orbital features of the giant planets that were\ndiscovered in last years orbiting nearby stars as well as the metallicity\nenhancement found in several stars associated with short-period planets.\n", "  An analytical model has been developed to empirically study the effects of\nstellar spots and faculae on the observed equivalent widths of Li {\\sc i} 6708,\nNa {\\sc i} 5896 and K {\\sc i} 7699 \\AA lines (and abundances in the case of\nlithium) in late-type stars, taking into account the changes in the observed\nmagnitudes and colors. Solar spectra corresponding to different active regions\nare used as input data and a range of filling factors are applied to simulate\nthe surfaces of stars with different levels of activity. Detailed comparisons\nbetween predicted and observed photometric colors and equivalent widths are\nmade for late-type stars of the Pleiades and the field. The observed\ndispersions in K {\\sc i} and Li {\\sc i} equivalent widths for Pleiades stars\ncan be partially accounted by the simultaneous effects of activity on colors\nand the line formation, indicating that the lithium-rotation connection\nsuggested for ~0.7-0.9 Msun Pleiades stars could be due in part to the stellar\nactivity. However, under realistic values for the filling factors, only a small\nportion of the observed spread could be explained by these effects\n", "  The linear marginal instability of an axisymmetric MHD Taylor-Couette flow of\ninfinite vertical extension is considered. For flows with a resting outer\ncylinder there is a well-known characteristic Reynolds number even without\nmagnetic field but for sufficiently weak magnetic fields there are solutions\nwith smaller Reynolds numbers so that a characteristic minimum exists. The\nminimum only exists, however, for not too small magnetic Prandtl numbers. For\nsmall magnetic Prandtl numbers one only finds the typical magnetic suppression\nof the instability.\n  We are here particularly interested in the case where the outer cylinder\nrotates so fast that the Rayleigh criterion for hydrodynamic stability is\nfulfilled. We find that for given magnetic Prandtl number now always a magnetic\nfield amplitude exists where the characteristic Reynolds number is minimal.\nThese critical values are computed for different magnetic Prandtl numbers. In\nall cases the Reynolds numbers are running with 1/Pm so that for the small\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers of sodium (10^-5) or gallium (10^-6) the critical\nReynolds numbers exceed values of 10^6 or 10^, resp.\n", "  We have retrieved multicolor WFPC2/HST data from the STScI archive for 27\nnearby Massive (>= 3x10^4 M_Sun) Young (< 20 Myr) star Clusters (MYCs). The\ndata represents the most-complete-to-date sample of clearly resolved MYCs. We\nhave analyzed their structural properties and have found that they can be\nclassified as either Super Star Clusters (SSCs) or as Scaled OB Associations\n(SOBAs). SSCs have a compact core possibly surrounded by a halo while SOBAs\nhave no core. A morphological sequence can be established from SSCs with weak\nhalos to SSCs with strong halos to SOBAs and we propose that this is linked to\nthe original mass distribution of the parent giant molecular clouds. Our\nresults indicate that a significant fraction of the stars in MYCs dissipate on\ntimescales of 10 Gyr or less due to the extended character of some of the\nclusters. Also, SSCs with ages < 7 Myr have smaller cores on average than those\nwith ages > 7 Myr, confirming predictions of numerical simulations with mass\nloss.\n", "  We have obtained low resolution optical spectra of 15 isolated planetary mass\nobjects (IPMOs) in the sigma Orionis cluster, and derived spectral types by\ncomparison with nearby M and L dwarfs. The spectral types are in the range late\nM - mid L, in agreement with our expectations based on colors and magnitudes\nfor bona fide members. Therefore, most of these objects have masses below the\ndeuterium burning limit. About 2/3 show H(alpha) in emission at our spectral\nresolution. From our spectroscopic and photometric data, we infer that three\nIPMOs in this sample may be binaries with components of similar masses. These\nresults confirm that the substellar mass function of the sigma Orionis cluster,\nin the form dN/dM, keeps rising in the planetary domain.\n", "  The Sun is located in a low-density region of the interstellar medium\npartially filled with hot gas that is the likely result of several nearby\nsupernova explosions within the last 10 Myr. Here we use astrometric data to\nshow that part of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association was located closer to\nthe present position of the Sun 5-7 Myr ago than today. Evolutionary synthesis\nmodels indicate that the association must have experienced ~20 supernova\nexplosions in the last 10-12 Myr, a prediction that is supported by the\ndetection of four or five runaway stars escaping from it. The ~6 SNe produced\nby the Lower Centaurus Crux subgroup are likely responsible for the creation of\nthe Local Bubble.\n", "  This paper shows that the ordinary Jeans wave number can be obtained as a\nlimiting case of a more general approach that includes dissipative effects.\nCorrections to the Jeans critical mass associated to viscosity are established.\nSome possible implications of the results are finally discussed.\n", "  High quality observations of the low-degree acoustic modes (p-modes) exist\nfor almost two complete solar cycles using the solar spectrophotometer Mark-I,\nlocated at the Observatorio del Teide (Tenerife, Spain) and operating now as\npart of the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON). We have performed a\nFourier analysis of 30 calibrated time-series of one year duration covering a\ntotal period of 15 years between 1984 and 1999. Applying different techniques\nto the resulting power spectra, we study the signature of the solar activity\nchanges on the low-degree p-modes. We show that the variation of the central\nfrequencies and the total velocity power (TVP) changes. A new method of\nsimultaneous fit is developed and a special effort has been made to study the\nfrequency-dependence of the frequency shift. The results confirm a variation of\nthe central frequencies of acoustic modes of about 450 nHz, peak-to-peak, on\naverage for low degree modes between 2.5 and 3.7 mHz. The TVP is\nanti-correlated with the common activity indices with a decrease of about 20%\nbetween the minimum and the maximum of solar cycle 22. The results are compared\nwith those obtained for intermediate degrees, using the LOWL data. The\nfrequency shift is found to increase with the degree with a weak l-dependence\nsimilar to that of the inverse mode mass. This verifies earlier suggestions\nthat near surface effects are predominant.\n", "  An explanation is presented for the rather strong total surface differential\nrotation of the observed very young solar-type stars like AB Dor and PZ Tel.\nDue to its rapid rotation a nonuniform energy flux leaves the stellar core so\nthat the outer convection zone is nonuniformly heated from below. Due to this\n`gravity darkening' of the equator a meridional flow is created flowing\nequatorwards at the surface and thus accelerating the equatorial rotation. The\neffect linearly grows with the normalized pole-equator difference, \\epsilon, of\nthe heat-flux at the bottom of the convection zone. A rotation rate of about 9\nh leads to \\epsilon=0.1 for a solar-type star. In this case the resulting\nequator-pole differences of the angular velocity at the stellar surface,\n\\delta\\Omega, varies from unobservable 0.005/day to the (desired) value of 0.03\nday$^{-1}$ when the dimensionless diffusivity factors $c_\\nu$ and c_\\chi vary\nbetween 1 and 0.1 (standard value c_\\nu \\simeq c_\\chi \\simeq 0.3, see Table 1.)\nIn all cases the related temperature differences between pole and equator at\nthe surface are unobservably small.\n  The (clockwise) meridional circulation which we obtain flows opposite to the\n(counterclockwise) circulation appearing as a byproduct in the \\Lambda-theory\nof the nonuniform rotation in outer convection zones. The consequences of this\nsituation for those dynamo theories of stellar activity are discussed which\nwork with the meridional circulation as the dominant magnetic-advection effect\nin latitude to produce the solar-like form of the butterfly diagram.\n  Key words: Hydrodynamics, Star: rotation, Stars: pre-main sequence, Stellar\nactivity\n", "  We are looking at quasar environment in the context of large-scale structure\n(LSS) - a new approach, giving a more informed interpretation of quasar-galaxy\ncorrelations. This paper presents our first results for a sample of z ~ 0.3\nquasars. We are using Voronoi tessellation applied in colour (B_J - R) slices\nfor the detection of galaxy clusters and the minimal spanning tree (MST) to\ndelineate the large-scale structure. This new cluster-detection method allows\nus to find reliably galaxy clusters at z < 0.3 from SuperCOSMOS measurements of\nUK Schmidt plates. By reconstructing the large-scale structure in a relatively\nnarrow redshift band (0.2 < z < 0.3), we show that quasars follow the\nlarge-scale structure traced by galaxy clusters. None of the quasars in our\nradio-quiet sample is located in the central area of a galaxy cluster. Two\nquasars, found in a very rich environment, are actually located between two\nvery close galaxy clusters, consistent with results on z ~ 1 quasars suggesting\nthat cluster merg ers may be involved in one of the quasar formation\nmechanisms.\n", "  We have used WFPC2 VRI observations to calculate the distances to three\nnearby galaxies, NGC 4214, UGC 685, and UGC 5456 using the tip of the red giant\nbranch method. Our values for NGC 4214 (2.94 +/- 0.18 Mpc) and UGC 685 (4.79\n+/- 0.30 Mpc) are the most precise measurementes of the distances to these\nobjects ever made. For UGC 5456 the data do not allow us to reach a decisive\nconclusion since there are two possible solutions, one leading towards a short\ndistance around 3.8 Mpc and another one towards a long distance of 5.6 Mpc or\nmore.\n", "  The steep spectrum of IRAS F02044+0957 was obtained with the RATAN-600 radio\ntelescope at four frequencies. Optical spectroscopy of the system components,\nwas carried out with the 2.1m telescope of the Guillermo Haro Observatory.\nObservational data allow us to conclude that this object is a pair of\ninteracting galaxies, a LINER and a HII galaxy, at $z=0.093$.\n", "  Radio sources from the decametric UTR--2 catalog were cross-identified with\nother radio catalogs at higher frequencies. We used the CATS database to\nextract all sources within the UTR beam size ($\\sim40'$) to find candidate\nradio identifications. Using the least squares method we fitted the spectrum of\neach source with one of a set of curves. We extracted NVSS and FIRST radio\nimages for the radio-identified sources, and looked for a possible relation\nbetween size and spectral index.\n", "  In the Cold Dark Matter (hereafter CDM) scenario even isolated density peaks\ncontain a high fraction of small scale clumps having velocities larger than the\naverage escape velocity from the structure. These clumps populate\nprotoclusters, especially in the peripheral regions, r > R_f (where R_f is the\nfiltering scale). During the cluster collapse and the subsequent secondary\ninfall, collapsing or infalling clumps (having v<v_esc) interact with the\nquoted unbound clumps (or high speed clumps, as we also call them) having v >\nv_esc. We study the interaction between these two kind of clumps by means of\nthe impulse approximation and we find that the collapse of bound clumps is\naccelerated with respect to the homogeneous case (Gunn & Gott's model). The\nacceleration of the collapse increases with decreasing height of the peak, \\nu.\nWe finally compare the acceleration produced by this effect to the slowing down\neffect produced by the gravitational interaction of the quadrupole moment of\nthe system with the tidal field of the matter of the neighboring proto-clusters\nstudied in Del Popolo & Gambera. We find that the magnitude of the slowing down\neffect is larger than the acceleration produced by the effect studied in this\npaper, only in the outskirts of the cluster. We want to stress that the one\nwhich we study in this paper is also present in an isolated protocluster, being\nproduced by the interaction of the collapsing clumps with the unbound\nsubstructure internal to the collapsing clumps itself while that studied in Del\nPopolo & Gambera (1998) is produced by substructure external to the density\npeak.\n", "  The gamma-ray burst GRB000210 had the highest gamma-ray peak flux of any\nevent localized by BeppoSAX as yet but it did not have a detected optical\nafterglow. It is therefore one of the events recently classified as dark GRBs\nor GHOST (GRB Hiding Optical Source Transient), whose origin is still unclear.\nChandra observations allowed us to localize this GRB within ~1\" and a radio\ntransient was detected with the VLA. We identify the likely (P=0.01) host\ngalaxy of this burst at z=0.846. The X-ray spectrum of the afterglow shows\nintrinsic absorption N_H=5x10**21 cm-2. The amount of dust needed to absorb the\noptical flux of this object is consistent with the above HI column density,\ngiven a dust-to-gas ratio similar to that of our Galaxy. We do not find\nevidence for a partially ionized absorber expected if the absorption takes\nplace in a Giant Molecular Cloud. We therefore conclude that either the gas is\nlocal to the GRB, but is condensed in small-scale high-density (n>~10**9 cm-3)\nclouds, or that the GRB is located in a dusty, gas-rich region of the galaxy.\nFinally, if GRB000210 lies at z>5, its X-ray absorbing medium would have to be\nsubstantially different from that observed in GRBs with optical afterglows.\n", "  (abridge version) The evolution of population III stars (Z=0) is followed\nfrom the pre-main sequence phase up to the AGB phase for intermediate-mass\nstars and up to C ignition in more massive stars...We find that, thanks to the\ndevelopment of mixing episodes (carbon injections) at the beginning of the AGB\nphase, the carbon abundance of the 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and 5Mo models is\nsignificantly increased in the envelope. This process then allows low- and\nintermediate-mass stars to achieve a ``standard'' thermally pulsing AGB\nphase... In the 7Mo model, the CNO envelope abundance following the second\ndredge-up is so large that the star does not experience the carbon injection\nepisode and follows a more standard thermally pulsing AGB evolution. Our\ncomputations also indicate that, thanks to a small overshooting at the base of\nthe convective envelope, the third dredge-up is already operating in stars with\nM >~1.5 Mo after a few pulses, and that by the end of our modeling, hot bottom\nburning is activated in stars more massive than ~ 2Mo. This evolutionary\nbehavior suggests that primordial low- and intermediate stars could have been\nsignificant contributors to the production of primary 12C, 14N, and may have\ncontributed to some extent to the production of Mg and Al and possibly\ns-elements (despite the lack of iron seeds) in the early universe.\n", "  The measurements of cosmic interplanetary dust by the instruments on board\nthe Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft contain the dynamical signature of dust\ngenerated by Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects, as well as short period Oort Cloud\ncomets and short period Jupiter family comets. While the dust concentration\ndetected between Jupiter and Saturn is mainly due to the cometary components,\nthe dust outside Saturn's orbit is dominated by grains originating from the\nEdgeworth-Kuiper Belt. In order to sustain a dust concentration that accounts\nfor the Pioneer measurements, short period external Jupiter family comets, on\norbits similar to comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann-1, have to produce $8\\times\n10^4:{\\rm g}:{\\rm s}^{-1}$ of dust grains with sizes between 0.01 and $6:{\\rm\nmm}$. A sustained production rate of $3\\times 10^5:{\\rm g}:{\\rm s}^{-1}$ has to\nbe provided by short period Oort cloud comets on 1P/Halley-like orbits. The\ncomets can not, however, account for the dust flux measured outside Saturn's\norbit. The measurements there can only be explained by a generation of dust\ngrains in the Edgeworth-Kuiper belt by mutual collisions of the source objects\nand by impacts of interstellar dust grains onto the objects' surfaces. These\nprocesses have to release in total $5\\times 10^7:{\\rm g}:{\\rm s}^{-1}$ of dust\nfrom the Edgeworth Kuiper belt objects in order to account for the amount of\ndust found by Pioneer beyond Saturn, making the Edgeworth-Kuiper disk the\nbrightest extended feature of the Solar System when observed from afar.\n", "  Hydrodynamical (HD) simulations played an important role in understanding the\ndynamics and shaping of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the past century. However,\nHD solutions are just a first order approach. The new millennium arrives with\nthe generalized understanding that the effects of magnetic fields (i.e., MHD)\nare necessary to study the dynamics of PNe. Thus, B-fields introduce a whole\nnew number of physical possibilities for the modeling. We here review recent\nadvances in MHD modeling of PNe.\n", "  The hydrodynamic stability of accretion disks is considered. The particular\nquestion is whether the combined action of a (stable) vertical density\nstratification and a (stable) radial differential rotation gives rise to a new\ninstability for nonaxisymmetric modes of disturbances. The existence of such an\ninstability is not suggested by the well-known Solberg-Hoiland criterion. It is\nalso not suggested by a local analysis for disturbances in general\nstratifications of entropy and angular momentum which is presented in our\nSection 2 confirming the results of the Solberg-Hoiland criterion also for\nnonaxisymmetric modes within the frame of ideal hydrodynamics but only in the\nframe of a short-wave approximation for small m. As a necessary condition for\nstability we find that only conservative external forces are allowed to\ninfluence the stable disk. As magnetic forces are never conservative, linear\ndisk instabilities should only exist in the magnetohydrodynamical regime which\nindeed contains the magnetorotational instability as a much-promising\ncandidate. To overcome some of the used approximations in a numerical\napproach,the equations of the compressible adiabatic hydrodynamics are\nintegrated imposing initial nonaxisymmetric velocity perturbations with m=1 to\nm=200.\n  Only solutions with decaying kinetic energy are found. The system always\nsettles in a vertical equilibrium stratification according to pressure balance\nwith the gravitational potential of the central object. keywords: accretion\ndisks -- hydrodynamic instabilities -- turbulence\n", "  The mass power spectrum for a Universe dominated by the Chaplygin gas is\nevaluated numerically from scales of the order of the Hubble horizon to 100\nMpc. The results are compared with a pure baryonic Universe and a cosmological\nconstant model. In all three cases, the spectrum increases with k, the\nwavenumber of the perturbations. The slope of the spectrum is higher for the\nbaryonic model and smaller for the cosmological constant model, the Chaplygin\ngas interpolating these two models. The results are analyzed in terms of the\nsound velocity of the Chaplygin gas and the moment the Universe begins to\naccelerate.\n", "  We study the far-infrared emission properties of the nearby starburst galaxy\nNGC 253 based on IRAS maps and an ISOPHOT map at 180 microns. Based on the\nanalysis of the light profiles, we have been able to identify three main\nstructural components: an unresolved nuclear component, an exponential disk,\nand a kiloparsec scale bar.In addition, we also found a ring structure at the\nend of the bar that is particularly conspicuous at 12 microns. The Spectral\nEnergy Distribution (SED) of each morphological component has been modeled as\nthermal dust emission at different temperatures. The unresolved nuclear\ncomponent is dominated by cold dust emission (T ~ 50 K), whereas the disk\nemission is dominated by very cold dust (T ~ 16 K) plus a contribution from\ncold dust (T ~ 55 K). The bar emission corresponds mainly to cold dust (T ~ 23\nK) plus a warm component (T ~ 148 K). We detect an extension of the disk\nemission due to very cold dust, which contributes a large fraction (94%) of the\ntotal dust mass of the galaxy. The estimated total dust mass is 8.2 +/- 10^7\nMsun.\n", "  We present the results of a three-year photometric study of the $\\delta$\nScuti star UV Trianguli. Our data sets consist of 9378 differential\nmeasurements in Johnson V together with a few data collected into the\nStr\\\"{o}mgren {\\em uvby$\\beta$} system. UV Tri is at least a biperiodic\nvariable. The two best-fitting frequencies, $f_1$=9.3298 d$^{-1}$ and\n$f_2$=10.8513 d$^{-1}$, are still not the complete set of pulsation frequencies\nrepresenting the star's light variations. A suspected third frequency might\npresent in the star. Several ``anomalous cycles'' are observed in the light\ncurves. They seem real, but are aperiodic. We derive the colour indices and\nphysical parameters for the variable and conclude that it is a Population I\n$\\delta$ Sct star with normal metal abundance ([Me/H]=0.0$\\pm$n0.1 dex)\nevolving on its main sequence stage at an early evolutionary phase before the\nturn-off point. Finally, we compare the observed oscillation frequencies with\ntheoretical models. The two pulsation modes of UV Tri are likely nonradial to\nbe gravity modes.\n", "  The linear marginal instability of an MHD Taylor-Couette flow of infinite\nvertical extension is considered. For hydrodynamically unstable flows the\nminimum Reynolds number exists even without a magnetic field, but there are\nalso solutions with smaller Reynolds numbers for certain (weak) magnetic\nfields. The magnetic field can, therefore, destabilize the rotating flow. This\ninstability, however, can only exist for not too small magnetic Prandtl\nnumbers. Also the situation for nonaxisymmetric disturbances is considered.\nWithout magnetic fields such modes possess higher Reynolds numbers than the\naxisymmetric modes. The situation is changed in the MHD regime. For modest\nmagnetic fields the excitation of modes with m=1 is easier than the excitation\nof modes with m=0 if critical magnetic amplitudes are exceeded.\n", "  The eddy viscosity in the solar supergranulation layer is derived from the\nobserved rotational shear by computing theoretical rotation laws for the\noutermost parts of the solar convection zone using the results from numerical\nsimulations of rotating convection as input. By varying the eddy viscosity, the\nresults can be tuned to match the observations. The value of 1.5 X 10^13 cm^2/s\nfound for the eddy viscosity is considerably larger than the eddy magnetic\ndiffusivity derived from the sunspot decay. The results are checked by\ncomparison of the horizontal cross correlations of the velocity fluctuations\nwith the observed Ward profile.\n", "  The linear stability of MHD Taylor-Couette flow of infinite vertical\nextension is considered for various magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm. The\ncalculations are performed for a wide gap container with \\hat\\eta=0.5 with an\naxial uniform magnetic field excluding counterrotating cylinders. For both\nhydrodynamically stable and unstable flows the magnetorotational instability\nproduces characteristic minima of the Reynolds number for certain (low)\nmagnetic field amplitudes and Pm> 0.01. For Pm <~ 1 there is a characteristic\nmagnetic field amplitude beyond which the instability sets in in form of\nnonaxisymmetric spirals with the azimuthal number m=1. Obviously, the magnetic\nfield is able to excite nonaxisymmetric configurations despite of the tendency\nof differential rotation to favor axisymmetric magnetic fields which is known\nfrom the dynamo theory. If Pm is too big or too small, however, the\naxisymmetric mode with m=0 appears to be the most unstable one possessing the\nlowest Reynolds numbers -- as it is also true for hydrodynamic Taylor-Couette\nflow or for very weak fields. That the most unstable mode for modest Pm proves\nto be nonaxisymmetric must be considered as a strong indication for the\npossibility of dynamo processes in connection with the magnetorotational\ninstability.\n", "  We measure the eddy viscosity in the outermost layers of the solar convection\nzone by comparing the rotation law computed with the Reynolds stress resulting\nfrom f-plane simulations of the angular momentum transport in rotating\nconvection with the observed differential rotation pattern. The simulations\nlead to a negative vertical and a positive horizontal angular momentum\ntransport. The consequence is a subrotation of the outermost layers, as it is\nindeed indicated both by helioseismology and the observed rotation rates of\nsunspots. In order to reproduce the observed gradient of the rotation rate a\nvalue of about 1.5 x 10^{13} cm/s for the eddy viscosity is necessary.\nComparison with the magnetic eddy diffusivity derived from the sunspot decay\nyields a surprisingly large magnetic Prandtl number of 150 for the\nsupergranulation layer. The negative gradient of the rotation rate also drives\na surface meridional flow towards the poles, in agreement with the results from\nDoppler measurements. The successful reproduction of the abnormally positive\nhorizontal cross correlation (on the northern hemisphere) observed for bipolar\ngroups then provides an independent test for the resulting eddy viscosity.\n", "  In this paper, I use the extension of the excursion set model of Sheth &\nTormen (2002) and the barrier shape obtained in Del Popolo & Gambera (1998) to\ncalculate the unconditional halo mass function, and the conditional mass\nfunction in several cosmological models. I show that the barrier obtained in\nDel Popolo & Gambera (1998), which takes account of tidal interaction between\nproto-haloes, is a better description of the mass functions than the spherical\ncollapse and is in good agreement with numerical simulations (Tozzi & Governato\n1998, and Governato et al. 1999). The results are also in good agreement with\nthose obtained by Sheth & Tormen (2002), only slight differences are observed\nexpecially at the low mass end. I moreover calculate, and compare with\nsimulations, the temperature function obtained by means of the mass functions\npreviously calculated and also using an improved version of the M-T relation,\nwhich accounts for the fact that massive clusters accrete matter\nquasi-continuously, and finally taking account of the tidal interaction with\nneighboring clusters. Even in this case the discrepancy between the\nPress-Schecter predictions and simulations is considerably reduced.\n", "  Supernova 1998bu in the galaxy M96 was observed by COMPTEL for a total of 88\ndays starting 17 days after the explosion. We searched for a signal in the 847\nkeV and 1238 keV lines of radioactive 56Co from this type Ia supernova. Using\nseveral different analysis methods, we did not detect SN1998bu. Our\nmeasurements should have been sensitive enough to detect 60Co gamma-rays as\npredicted from supernova models. Our 2-sigma flux limit is 2.3 10^{-5} photons\ncm^{-2} s^{-1}; this would correspond to 0.35 solar mass of ejected 56Ni, if\nSN1998bu were at a distance of 11.3 Mpc and transparent to MeV gamma rays for\nthe period of our measurements. We discuss our measurements in the context of\ncommon supernova models, and conclude disfavoring a supernova event with large\nmixing and major parts of the freshly-generated radioactivity in outer layers.\n", "  We give a thorough investigation of sequences of uniformly rotating,\nhomogeneous axisymmetric Newtonian equilibrium configurations that bifurcate\nfrom highly flattened Maclaurin spheroids. Each one of these sequences\npossesses a mass-shedding limit. Starting at this point, the sequences proceed\ntowards the Maclaurin sequence and beyond. The first sequence leads to the well\nknown Dyson rings, whereas the end points of the higher sequences are\ncharacterized by the formation of a two-body system, either a core-ring system\n(for the second, the fourth etc. sequence) or a two-ring system (for the third,\nthe fifth etc. sequence). Although the general qualitative picture drawn by\nEriguchi and Hachisu in the eighties has been confirmed, slight differences\nturned out in the interpretation of the origin of the first two-ring sequence\nand in the general appearance of fluid bodies belonging to higher sequences.\n", "  We consider the evolution of magnetic fields under the influence of Hall\ndrift and Ohmic decay. The governing equation is solved numerically, in a\nspherical shell with r_i/r_o = 0.75. Starting with simple free decay modes as\ninitial conditions, we then consider the subsequent evolution. The Hall effect\ninduces so-called helicoidal oscillations, in which energy is redistributed\namong the different modes. We find that the amplitude of these oscillations can\nbe quite substantial, with some of the higher harmonics becoming comparable to\nthe original field. Nevertheless, this transfer of energy to the higher\nharmonics is not sufficient to significantly accelerate the decay of the\noriginal field, at least not at the R_B = O(100) parameter values accessible to\nus, where this Hall parameter R_B measures the ratio of the Ohmic timescale to\nthe Hall timescale. We do find clear evidence though of increasingly fine\nstructures developing for increasingly large R_B, suggesting that perhaps this\nHall-induced cascade to ever shorter lengthscales is eventually sufficiently\nvigorous to enhance the decay of the original field. Finally, the implications\nfor the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields are discussed.\n", "  Recent observations support the view that the universe is described by a FLRW\nmodel with $\\Omega_m^0 \\approx 0.3$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}^0 \\approx 0.7$, and $w\n\\leq -1/3$ at the present epoch. There are several theoretical suggestions for\nthe cosmological $\\Lambda$ component and for the particular form of the energy\ntransfer between this dark energy and matter. This gives a strong motive for a\nsystematic study of general properties of two-fluid FLRW models. We consider a\ncombination of one perfect fluid, which is quintessence with negative pressure\n($p_Q = w\\epsilon_Q$), and another perfect fluid, which is a mixture of\nradiation and/or matter components with positive pressure ($p = \\beta\n\\epsilon_m$), which define the associated one-fluid model ($p = \\gamma\n\\epsilon$). We introduce a useful classification which contains 4 classes of\nmodels defined by the presence or absence of energy transfer and by the\nstationarity ($w = const.$ and $\\beta = const.$) or/and non stationarity ($w$\nor $\\beta$ time dependent) of the equations of state. It is shown that, for\ngiven $w$ and $\\beta$, the energy transfer defines $\\gamma$ and, therefore, the\ntotal gravitating mass and dynamics of the model. We study important examples\nof two-fluid FLRW models within the new classification. The behaviour of the\nenergy content, gravitating mass, pressure, and the energy transfer are given\nas functions of the scale factor. We point out three characteristic scales,\n$a_E$, $a_{\\cal P}$ and $a_{\\cal M}$, which separate periods of time in which\nquintessence energy, pressure and gravitating mass dominate. Each sequence of\nthe scales defines one of 6 evolution types.\n", "  HCG 54 has been classified as a compact galaxy group by Hickson, but its\nnature is uncertain because of its unusual properties. We present here a study\nof HCG~54 based on deep optical images and spectroscopy as well as high spatial\nand spectral resolution HI observations obtained at the VLA. Both optical and\nradio data indicate clearly that HCG~54 is a product of a recent merger\ninvolving at least two galaxies. Our optical images have revealed a blue\nelongated structure associated with HCG 54a embedded in a rounder and redder\nstellar envelope. Several ripples or shells whose center is located near HCG\n54a and b are also detected. These observed features are similar to those found\nin the numerical simulations of tidal interactions involving two equal mass\ndisk galaxies. This system is embedded in an HI cloud 12 kpc in diameter, and a\n20 kpc HI tidal tail emerges from its western edge. Both the HI distribution\nand kinematics are consistent with a recent history of a deeply penetrating\ninteraction or a merger. Based on the analysis of our new data we propose that\nHCG 54 is the remnant of a merger in an advanced stage, whose main body is what\nhas been called HCG 54a, while HCG 54b marks the location of a strong starburst\ninduced by the interaction, as evidenced by the Wolf Rayet stellar population\nthat we detect. Optical spectra of HCG 54c and d show HII region features and\nare interpreted as tidal debris of the collision undergoing active star\nformation.\n", "  Specific internal self-interactions in gaseous cosmic fluids are shown to\ngive rise to effective negative pressures which may violate the strong energy\ncondition. On this basis we discuss the transition from an initial de Sitter\nphase to a subsequent Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker period as a\nnon-equilibrium configuration of an ultrarelativistic gas. An accelerated\nexpansion of the present universe is obtained as the consequence of a negative\ninternal friction force which is self-consistently exerted on the\nnon-relativistic cold dark matter (CDM) type microscopic constituents of the\ncosmic gas.\n", "  The dynamical evolution of super star clusters (SSCs) moving in the\nbackground of a dark matter halo has been investigated as a possible event\nresponsible for the formation of bulges in late-type spirals. The underlying\nphysical processes include sinking of SSCs due to the dynamical friction and\nstripping of SSCs on their way to the center. Our model calculations show that\nonly sinking of circumnuclear SSCs contributes to the formation of galactic\nbulges at the early stage. Based on the assumption of a universal density\nprofile for the dark matter halo, and an isothermal model for the SSCs, our\nsimulations have yielded bulges that are similar in many aspects to the\nobservational ones. In particular, the derived surface density profiles can be\nwell fitted by anexponential structure with nuclear cusps, which is consistent\nwith HST observations.\n", "  We show that with the help of a suitable coupling between dark energy and\ncold dark matter it is possible to reproduce any scaling solution $\\rho\n_{X}\\propto \\rho_{M}a^{\\xi}$, where $\\rho_{X}$ and $\\rho_{M}$ are the densities\nof dark energy and dark matter, respectively. We demonstrate how the case $\\xi\n= 1$ alleviates the coincidence problem. Future observations of supernovae at\nhigh redshift as well as quasar pairs which are planned to discriminate between\ndifferent cosmological models will also provide direct constraints on the\ncoupling between dark matter and dark energy.\n", "  The first results of our ongoing near-infrared (NIR) survey of the variable\nred giants in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using the Infrared Survey Facility\n(IRSF) and the SIRIUS infrared camera, are presented. Many very red stars were\ndetected and found that most of them are variables. In the observed\ncolour-magnitude diagram ($J-K, K$) and the stellar $K$ magnitude distribution,\nthe tip of the first giant branch (TRGB), where helium burning in the core\nstarts, is clearly seen. Apart from the genuine AGB variables, we found many\nvariable stars at luminosities around the TRGB. From this result, we infer that\na substantial fraction of them are RGB variables.\n", "  We argue that clusters of galaxies have an intergalactic medium, which is\npermeated by strong magnetic fields and also has a contribution of pressure\nfrom cosmic rays. These two components of total pressure are probably highly\ntime dependent, and range probably between 1/10 of the gas pressure up to\nequipartition between gas pressure and the sum of the two other components.\nRadio galaxies are likely to provide the main source for both magnetic fields\nand cosmic rays. In this concept it becomes easy to understand the occasional\nmismatch between the total mass inferred from the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium derived purely from gas, and the total mass derived from lensing\ndata. We also suggest that the structure and topology of the magnetic field may\nbe highly inhomogeneous - at least over a certain range of scales, and may\ncontain long twisted filaments of strong magnetic fields, as on the Sun. The\nanalogy with the interstellar medium may be fruitful to explore further, where\nwe do not know where magnetic fields come from, but suspect that the cosmic\nrays derive from supernova explosions. In such an analogy it becomes useful to\nrefer to \"radio galaxy explosions\" in clusters of galaxies. A full scale\nexploration of all the implications, especially of the notion that occasionally\ncomplete equipartition may be reached, is a task for the future.\n", "  Long known to be an unusual early-type star by virtue of its hard and strong\nX-ray emission, tau Scorpii poses a severe challenge to the standard picture of\nO-star wind-shock X-ray emission. The Chandra HETGS spectrum now provides\nsignificant direct evidence that this B0.2 star does not fit this standard\nwind-shock framework. The many emission lines detected with the Chandra\ngratings are significantly narrower than what would be expected from a star\nwith the known wind properties of tau Sco, although they are broader than the\ncorresponding lines seen in late-type coronal sources. While line ratios are\nconsistent with the hot plasma on this star being within a few stellar radii of\nthe photosphere, from at least one He-like complex there is evidence that the\nX-ray-emitting plasma is located more than a stellar radius above the\nphotosphere. The Chandra spectrum of tau Sco is harder and more variable than\nthose of other hot stars, with the exception of the young magnetized O star\ntheta Ori C. We discuss these new results in the context of wind, coronal, and\nhybrid wind-magnetic models of hot-star X-ray emission.\n", "  The linear stability of MHD Taylor-Couette flow of infinite vertical\nextension is considered for liquid sodium with its small magnetic Prandtl\nnumber Pm of order of 10^-5 and an uniform axial magnetic field. The sign of\nthe constant a in the basic rotation law \\Omega=a+b/R^2 strongly influences the\npresented results. It is negative for resting outer cylinder. The main point\nhere is that the subcritical excitation which occurs for large Pm disappears\nfor small Pm. This is the reason that the existence of the magnetorotational\ninstability remained unknown over decades. For rotating outer cylinder the\nlimiting case a=0 plays an exceptional role. The hydromagnetic instability\nexists with certain Reynolds numbers at certain Hartmann numbers of the\nmagnetic field. These Reynolds numbers exactly scale with Pm^-1/2 resulting in\nmoderate values of order 10^4 for Pm=10^-5. However, already for the smallest\npositive value of a the Reynolds numbers start to scale as 1/Pm leading to much\nhigher values of order 10^6 for Pm=10^-5. Also nonaxisymmetric modes have been\nconsidered. With vacuum boundary conditions their excitation is always more\ndifficult than the excitation of axisymmetric modes; we never observed a\ncrossover of the lines of marginal stability. For conducting walls, however,\nsuch crossovers exist for both resting and rotating outer cylinders, and this\nmight be essential for future dynamo experiments.\n", "  The question is answered whether kinematic alpha^2-shell-dynamos are able to\nproduce a cyclic activity or not. The alpha-effect is allowed to be\nlatitudinally inhomogeneous and/or anisotropic, but it is assumed as radially\nuniform in the turbulent shell.\n  For a symmetric alpha-tensor we only find oscillatory solutions if i) the\nalpha_zz vanishes or is of the opposite sign as alpha_{phi phi}, ii) the\nalpha-effect is strongly concentrated to the equatorial region and iii) the\nalpha-effect is concentrated to a rather thin outer shell. In the other cases\nalmost always the nonaxisymmetric field mode S1 possesses the lowest dynamo\nnumber which slowly drifts along the azimuthal direction. Also uniform but\nanisotropic alpha-effect (alpha_zz = 0) leads to the nonaxisymmetric solutions\nas it is confirmed by the Karlsruhe dynamo experiment. However, one of the\nantisymmetric parts of the alpha-tensor basically plays the role of a\ndifferential rotation in the induction equation. Using for the radial profile\nof this effect the results of anumerical simulation for the alpha-tensor of the\nsolar convection zone, one indeed finds the possibility of oscillating\nalpha^2-dynamos even without the existence of real nonuniform plasma rotation.\n", "  We have analyzed ISO SWS 01 observations for 61 proto-planetary nebulae\ncandidates and classified their spectra according to their dominant chemistry.\nOn the basis of our classification and the more general classification of SWS\n01 spectra by Kraemer et al. (2002) we discuss the connection between\nproto-planetary nebulae candidates and planetary nebulae, with emphasis on\npossible precursors of planetary nebulae with [WR] central stars.\n", "  In this article we present and study a scaling law of the $m\\Gamma_m$ CMB\nFourier spectrum on rings which allows us (i) to combine spectra corresponding\nto different colatitude angles (e.g. several detectors at the focal plane of a\ntelescope), and (ii) to recover the $C_l$ power spectrum once the $\\Gamma_m$\ncoefficients have been measured. This recovery is performed numerically below\nthe 1% level for colatitudes $\\Theta> 80^\\circ$ degrees. In addition, taking\nadvantage of the smoothness of the $C_l$ and of the $\\Gamma_m$, we provide\nanalytical expressions which allow to recover one of the spectrum at the 1%\nlevel, the other one being known.\n", "  We have measured the oscillator strength of the Ni I line at 6300.34 \\AA,\nwhich is known to be blended with the forbidden [O I] $\\lambda$6300 line, used\nfor determination of the oxygen abundance in cool stars. We give also\nwavelengths of the two isotopic line components of $^{58}$Ni and $^{60}$Ni\nderived from the asymmetric laboratory line profile. These two line components\nof Ni I have to be considered when calculating a line profile of the 6300 \\AA\\\nfeature observed in stellar and solar spectra. We also discuss the labelling of\nthe energy levels involved in the Ni I line, as level mixing makes the\ntheoretical predictions uncertain.\n", "  We present preliminary results of the XMM-Newton 50 ksec observation of the\nPerseus cluster. The global east/west asymmetry of the gas temperature and\nsurface brightness distributions, approximately aligned with the chain of\nbright galaxies, suggests an ongoing merger, although the modest degree of the\nobserved asymmetry certainly excludes a major merger interpretation. The chain\nof galaxies probably traces the filament along which accretion has started some\ntime ago and is continuing at the present time. A cold and dense (low entropy)\ncluster core like Perseus is probably well \"protected\" against the penetration\nof the gas of infalling groups and poor clusters whereas in non-cooling core\nclusters like Coma and A1367, infalling subclusters can penetrate deeply into\nthe core region. In Perseus, gas associated with infalling groups may be\nstripped completely at the outskirts of the main cluster and only compression\nwaves (shocks) may reach the central regions. We argue that the passage of such\na wave(s) can qualitatively explain the overall horseshoe shaped appearance of\nthe gas temperature map (the hot horseshoe surrounds the colder, low entropy\ncore) as well as other features of the Perseus cluster core. As compression\nwaves traverse the cluster core, they can induce oscillatory motion of the\ncluster gas which can generate multiple sharp \"edges\", on opposite sides or the\ncentral galaxy. Gas motions induced by mergers may be a natural way to explain\nthe high frequency of \"edges\" seen in clusters with cooling cores.\n", "  Dynamic models of M-type Mira variables predict the occurrence of water\n\"shells\", i.e. of zones of high H2O density and high H2O absorption inside the\nstellar atmosphere. The density, position and width of these shells is closely\ncorrelated with different types of two-component shapes of the intensity\ndistribution on the disk in the H, K and L near-continuum bandpasses. We\ninvestigate these correlations and highlight the role of a spectrophotometric\nH2O index that warns against serious complications in diameter measurements in\nthe case of substantial water contamination of the bandpass of observation.\nSimultaneous spectrophotometric and interferometric measurements may allow\nobservers to estimate real continuum diameters more precisely.\n", "  Chemical abundance data for the Galaxy show a wide dispersion. We try to\ncheck if this dispersion may also be found with chemical evolution models as an\neffect of variations of an Initial Mass Function (IMF) which follows a\nPoisson's distribution\n", "  In the standard hot big bang model, the expansion of the early universe is\ngiven by the Friedmann equation with an energy density dominated by\nrelativistic particles. Since in a variety of models this equation is altered,\nwe introduce modifications in the Friedmann equation and show that we can\nconstrain them using big bang nucleosynthesis data. When there is no\nneutrino/antineutrino asymmetry these modifications are tightly bounded but in\npresence of an asymmetry the bounds become much looser. As an illustration, we\napply our results to a model where the second and third families couple to\ngravity differently than the first family (non-universal gravity).\n", "  VLT/FORS spectroscopy and 2MASS near-infrared photometry, together with\npreviously known data, have been used to establish the membership and the\nproperties of a sample of low-mass candidate members of the sigma Orionis\ncluster with masses spanning from 1 Msun down to about 0.013 Msun (i.e.,\ndeuterium-burning mass limit). We have observed K-band infrared excess and\nremarkably intense H(alpha) emission in various cluster members, which, in\naddition to the previously detected forbidden emision lines and the presence of\nLiI in absorption at 6708 A, have allowed us to tentatively classify sigma\nOrionis members as classical or weak-line TTauri stars and substellar analogs.\nVariability of the H(alpha) line has been investigated and detected in some\nobjects. Based on the K-band infrared excesses and the intensity of H(alpha)\nemission, we estimate that the minimum disk frequency of the sigma Orionis\nlow-mass population is in the range 5-12%.\n", "  With the recent release of large (i.e., > hundred million objects),\nwell-calibrated photometric surveys, such as DPOSS, 2MASS, and SDSS,\nspectroscopic identification of important targets is no longer a simple issue.\nIn order to enhance the returns from a spectroscopic survey, candidate sources\nare often preferentially selected to be of interest, such as brown dwarfs or\nhigh redshift quasars. This approach, while useful for targeted projects, risks\nmissing new or unusual species. We have, as a result, taken the alternative\npath of spectroscopically identifying interesting sources with the sole\ncriterion being that they are in low density areas of the g - r and r - i\ncolor-space defined by the DPOSS survey. In this paper, we present three\npeculiar broad absorption line quasars that were discovered during this\nspectroscopic survey, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach. PSS\nJ0052+2405 is an Iron LoBAL quasar at a redshift z = 2.4512 with very broad\nabsorption from many species. PSS J0141+3334 is a reddened LoBAL quasar at z =\n3.005 with no obvious emission lines. PSS J1537+1227 is a Iron LoBAL at a\nredshift of z = 1.212 with strong narrow Mgii and Feii emission. Follow-up high\nresolution spectroscopy of these three quasars promises to improve our\nunderstanding of BAL quasars. The sensitivity of particular parameter spaces,\nin this case a two-color space, to the redshift of these three sources is\ndramatic, raising questions about traditional techniques of defining quasar\npopulations for statistical analysis.\n", "  In this paper, I test by numerical simulations the results of Del Popolo &\nGambera (1998),dealing with the extension of Chandrasekhar and von Neumann's\nanalysis of the statistics of the gravitational field to systems in which\nparticles (e.g., stars, galaxies) are inhomogeneously distributed. The paper is\nan extension of that of Ahmad & Cohen (1974), in which the authors tested some\nresults of the stochastic theory of dynamical friction developed by\nChandrasekhar & von Neumann (1943) in the case of homogeneous gravitational\nsystems. It is also a continuation of the work developed in Del Popolo\n(1996a,b), which extended the results of Ahmad & Cohen (1973), (dealing with\nthe study of the probability distribution of the stochastic force in\nhomogeneous gravitational systems) to inhomogeneous gravitational systems.\nSimilarly to what was done by Ahmad & Cohen (1974) in the case of homogeneous\nsystems, I test, by means of the evolution of an inhomogeneous system of\nparticles, that the theoretical rate of force fluctuation d F/dt describes\ncorrectly the experimental one, I find that the stochastic force distribution\nobtained for the evolved system is in good agreement with the Del Popolo &\nGambera (1998) theory. Moreover, in an inhomogeneous background the friction\nforce is actually enhanced relative to the homogeneous case.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared photometry, along with optical spectra,\nof the Type Ia supernova SN 2000E in the spiral galaxy NGC 6951. It was\ndiscovered by the staff of the Teramo Observatory during the monitoring of the\nSN 1999el. The observations span a time interval of 234 days in the optical and\n134 days in the near-infrared (starting 16 days and 7 days before maximum B\nlight, respectively). Optical spectra are available from 6 days before maximum\nB light to 122 days after it. SN 2000E exhibits a Dm15(B) = 0.94, thus being\nclassifiable as a slow-declining Type Ia SN and showing the distinctive\nfeatures of such a class of objects. Spectroscopically, SN 2000E appears as a\nnormal Type Ia SN, like SN 1990N. We could constrain reddening [E(B-V) ~0.5\nmag] and distance (mu0 ~32.14 mag) using a number of different methods. The\nbolometric luminosity curve of SN 2000E, allows a determination of the Ni56\nmass amounting to 0.9Msun.\n", "  The stability properties of inviscid protostellar disks are examined taking\ninto account the Hall effect and buoyancy. Depending on the parameters,\ndifferent types of instabilities can exist in different regions of disks. In a\nvery low ionized region, the instability associated with baroclinic effects of\nbuoyancy is likely most efficient. The Hall-driven shear instability can lead\nto destabilization of regions with a higher ionization. The magnetorotational\ninstability modified by buoyancy can only be a destabilizing factor in regions\nwith strong magnetic field or a relatively high conductivity ($\\sigma B^2 /\n\\rho > a_e \\Omega$, with $a_e$ the magnetization parameter of electrons).\n", "  We find the star HD 34700 to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We also\nidentify it as a weak-line T Tauri object The spectra of both components are\nvery similar and both show the Li I feature at 6708 \\AA. Strong arguments in\nfavour of the binary nature of the star as opposed to other possibilities are\noffered. It is very likely that the companion is also a T Tauri star of similar\nmass. A projected rotational velocity, $v$sin$i$, of 25 and 23 km/s$^{-1}$ has\nbeen estimated for the blue and red components. We present a list of the lines\nidentified and the radial velocities of the two components on three spectra\nobtained on consecutive nights.\n", "  The INTEGRAL Radiation Environment Monitor (IREM) is a payload supporting\ninstrument on board the INTEGRAL satellite. The monitor continually measures\nelectron and proton fluxes along the orbit and provides this information to the\nspacecraft on board data handler. The mission alert system broadcasts it to the\npayload instruments enabling them to react accordingly to the current radiation\nlevel. Additionally, the IREM conducts its autonomous research mapping the\nEarth radiation environment for the space weather program. Its scientific data\nare available for further analysis almost without delay.\n", "  A weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) is perhaps the most promising\ncandidate for the dark matter in the Galactic halo. The WIMP detection rate in\nlaboratory searches is fixed by the cross section for elastic WIMP-nucleus\nscattering. Here we calculate the contribution to this cross section from\ntwo-nucleon currents from pion exchange in the nucleus, and show that it may in\nsome cases be comparable to the one-nucleon current that has been considered in\nprior work, and perhaps help resolve the discrepancies between the various\ndirect dark-matter search experiments. We provide simple expressions that allow\nthese new contributions to be included in current calculations.\n", "  The 5-9 keV spectrum of the inner ~100 kpc of the Perseus cluster measured by\nXMM-Newton can be well described by an optically thin plasma emission model as\npredicted by the APEC code, without any need for invoking a strong Ni\noverabundance or the effects of resonant scattering. For the strongest 6.7 keV\nline of He-like iron, the optical depth of the cluster, calculated using\nobserved density, temperature and abundance profiles, is of order 3. The lack\nof evidence for resonant scattering effects implies gas motion in the core with\na range in velocities of at least half of the sound velocity. If this motion\nhas the character of small scale turbulence, then its dissipation would provide\nenough energy to compensate for radiative cooling of the gas. The activity of\nthe supermassive black hole at the center of the cluster may be the driving\nforce of the gas motion.\n", "  Low-mass and brown dwarfs have recently been found as wide companions to many\nnearby stars, formerly believed to be single. Wide binaries are usually found\nas common proper motion pairs. Sometimes, more than two objects share the same\nlarge proper motion, identifying them as nearby systems. We have found a third,\nlow-mass component to a known wide binary at a distance of about 21pc,\nconsisting of a red and a white dwarf (LHS4039 and LHS4040; about 150AU\nseparation). The new companion, APMPMJ2354-3316C separated by about 2200AU, was\nclassified as M8.5 dwarf. In recent spectroscopic observations it shows a very\nstrong $H_{\\alpha}$ emission line and blue continuum. Comparing this event to\nflares in late-type M dwarfs, we find some similarity with LHS2397a, a nearby\nM8 dwarf which is so far the only known example of a low-mass star with a tight\nbrown dwarf companion (separation of less than 4AU). The level of the activity\nas measured by $L_{H_{\\alpha}}/L_{bol}$ is comparable to that of the M9.5 dwarf\n2MASSWJ0149+29 both during the flare and in quiescence.\n", "  In the last decade we have come to realize that the traditional\nclassification of stellar clusters into open and globular clusters cannot be\neasily extended beyond the realm of the Milky Way, and that even for our Galaxy\nit is not fully valid. The main failure of the traditional classification is\nthe existence of Massive Young Clusters (MYCs), which are massive like Globular\nClusters (GCs) but also young like open clusters. We describe here the mass and\nage distributions of clusters in general with an emphasis on MYCs. We also\ndiscuss the issue of what constitutes a cluster and try to establish a general\nclassification scheme.\n", "  We investigate dynamics of scalar field with non-minimal kinetic term.\nNontrivial behavior of the field in the vicinity of singular points of kinetic\nterm is observed. In particular, the singular points could serve as attractor\nfor classical solutions.\n", "  We investigate some basic properties of Damped Lyman alpha systems based on\nthe Semi-Analytical model of disk galaxy formation theory. We derive the DLA\nmetallicity, column density, number density, gas content and cosmic star\nformation rate by assuming that disks form at the center of dark halos, and the\nmodelled DLAs are selected by Monte Carlo simulation according to the\ndistributions of halo properties. We find that DLA hosts are dominated by small\ngalaxies and biased to extended galaxies. In terms of model results, DLAs could\nnaturally arise in a $\\Lambda$CDM universe from radiatively cooled gas in dark\nmatter halos. However, model predicts a reverse correlation between metallicity\nand the column density when compared with observations, regardless of the\nproposed observational bias. We argue that this could be resulted from the\nmodel limitations, or the inadequacy of Schmidt-type star formation mode at\nhigh redshift, or/and the diversities of DLA populations.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the Magellanic Cloud planetary nebula SMP\n61 and of its nucleus, a Wolf-Rayet type star classified [WC 5-6]. We have\nperformed a detailed spectral analysis of the central star, using the Potsdam\ncode for expanding atmospheres in non-LTE. The fluxes from the model stellar\natmosphere were used to compute photoionization models of the nebula. All the\navailable observations, within their error bars, were used to constrain these\nmodels. We find that the ionizing fluxes predicted by the stellar model are\nbasically consistent with the fluxes needed by the photoionization model to\nreproduce the nebular emission, within the error margins. However, there are\nindications that the stellar model overestimates the number and hardness of\nLyman continuum photons. The photoionization models imply a clumped density\nstructure of the nebular material. The observed CIII] 1909/CII 4267 line ratio\nimplies the existence of carbon-rich clumps in the nebula. Such clumps are\nlikely produced by stellar wind ejecta, possibly mixed with the nebular\nmaterial. We discuss our results with regard to the stellar and nebular\npost-AGB evolution.\n", "  We report $R_cI_c$ light curves of 2 novae in the M31 galaxy which were\ndetected in the four year Nainital Microlensing Survey. One of these novae has\nbeen tracked from the initial increase in flux while other has been observed\nduring its descending phase of brightness. The photometry of the first nova\nduring the outburst phase suggests its peak $R_c$ magnitude to be about 17.2\nmag with a flux decline rate of 0.11 mag day$^{-1}$ which indicates that it was\na fast nova. A month after its outburst, it shows reddening followed by a\nplateau in $I_c$ flux. The second nova exhibits a bump in $R_c$ and $I_c$,\npossibly about three weeks after the outburst.\n", "  Strong constraints on possible variations in fundamental constants can be\nderived from HI 21-cm and molecular rotational absorption lines observed\ntowards quasars. With the aim of forming a statistical sample of constraints we\nhave begun a program of systematic searches for such absorption systems. Here\nwe describe molecular rotational searches in 25 damped Lyman-alpha systems\nwhere, in many cases, we set optical depth limits an order of magnitude better\nthan that required to detect the 4 known redshifted millimeter-wave absorbers.\nWe also discuss the contributory factors in the detectability of HI 21-cm\nabsorption, focusing on possible biases (e.g.low covering factors) in the\ncurrently known sample of absorbers and non-detections.\n", "  \\Archeops is a balloon--borne instrument dedicated to measuring cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies at high angular resolution\n($\\sim$ 12 arcmin.) over a large fraction (30%) of the sky in the\n(sub)millimetre domain (from 143 to 545 GHz). We describe the results obtained\nduring the last flight: the \\Archeops estimate of the CMB angular power\nspectrum linking for the first time \\Cobe scales and the first acoustic peak,\nconsequences in terms of cosmological parementers favouring a flat-$\\Lambda$\nUniverse. We also present the first measurement of galactic dust polarization\nand accurate maps of the galactic plane diffuse (sub) millimetre emisson.\n", "  We searched for spectral signatures from the exosphere of HD209458 in the UV\nand the near-IR with UVES and ISAAC at the VLT. We looked in particular for the\nhelium absorption feature at 10 830 \\AA predicted to be among the strongest\nones. The upper limit of the He I line derived is 0.5% at 3 $\\sigma$ for a 3\n\\AA bandwith. Planet-induced chromospheric activity search on HD209458 was also\nperformed.\n", "  The COBE-DMR 4-year maps displayed a strong non-Gaussian signal in the\n``inter-scale'' components of the bispectrum: their observed values did not\ndisplay the scatter expected from Gaussian maps. We re-examine this and other\nsuggested non-Gaussian features in the light of WMAP. We find that they all\ndisappear. Given that it was proved that COBE-DMR high noise levels and\ndocumented systematics could at most {\\it dilute} the observed non-Gaussian\nfeatures, we conclude that this dataset must have contained non-negligible\nundocumented systematic errors. It turns out that the culprit is a combination\nof QuadCube pixelization and data collected during the ``eclipse season''.\n", "  We have produced a catalog of 378 Galactic O stars with accurate spectral\nclassifications which is complete for V<8 but includes many fainter stars. The\ncatalog provides cross-identifications with other sources; coordinates\n(obtained in most cases from Tycho-2 data); astrometric distances for 24 of the\nnearest stars; optical (Tycho-2, Johnson, and Stromgren) and NIR photometry;\ngroup membership, runaway character, and multiplicity information; and a\nweb-based version with links to online services.\n", "  We present the results of a multiband survey for brown dwarfs in the\nChamaeleon I dark cloud with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) camera at the ESO/MPG\n2.2-m telescope on La Silla (Chile). The survey has revealed a substantial\npopulation of brown dwarfs in this southern star forming region. Candidates\nwere selected from R, I and H-alpha imaging observations. We also observed in\ntwo medium-band filters, M855 and M915, for the purpose of spectral type\ndetermination. The former filter covers a wavelength range containing spectral\nfeatures characteristic of M-dwarfs, while the latter lies in a relatively\nfeatureless wavelength region for these late-type objects. A correlation was\nfound between spectral type and (M855-M915) colour index for mid- to late\nM-type objects and early L-type dwarfs. With this method, we identify most of\nour object candidates as being of spectral type M5 or later. Our results show\nthat there is no strong drop in the number of objects for the latest spectral\ntypes, hence brown dwarfs may be as abundant as low-mass stars in this region.\nAlso, both kind of objects have a similar spatial distribution. We derive an\nindex $\\alpha = 0.6 \\pm 0.1$ of the mass function in this region of dispersed\nstar formation, in good agreement with the values obtained in other star\nforming regions and young clusters. Some of the brown dwarfs have strong\nH-alpha emission, suggesting mass accretion. For objects with published\ninfrared photometry, we find that strong H-alpha emission is related to a\nmid-infrared excess, indicative of the existence of a circumstellar disk.\n", "  About twenty years of radio observations in five bands (from 4.8 to 37 GHz)\nof the BL Lac object GC 0109+224 (S2 0109+22, RGB J0112+227), are presented and\nanalysed together with the optical data. Over the past ten years this blazar\nhas exhibited enhanced activity. There is only weak correlation between radio\nand optical flares delays, usually protracted on longer timescales in the radio\nwith respect to the optical. In some cases no radio flare counterpart was\nobserved for the optical outbursts. The radio variability, characterised by\npeaks superposition, shows hints of some characteristic timescales (around the\n3-4 years), and a fluctuation mode between the flickering and the shot noise.\nThe reconstructed spectral energy distribution, poorly monitored at high\nenergies, is preliminarily parameterised with a synchrotron-self Compton\ndescription. The smooth synchrotron continuum, peaked in the near-IR-optical\nbands, strengthens the hypothesis that this source could be an intermediate\nblazar. Moreover the intense flux in millimetre bands, and the optical and\nX-ray brightness, might suggest a possible detectable gamma-ray emission.\n", "  We present a detailed spectroscopic analysis of nitrogen abundances in 91\nsolar-type stars, 66 with and 25 without known planetary mass companions. All\ncomparison sample stars and 28 planet hosts were analysed by spectral synthesis\nof the near-UV NH band at 3360 \\AA observed at high resolution with the\nVLT/UVES,while the near-IR NI 7468 \\AA was measured in 31 objects. These two\nabundance indicators are in good agreement. We found that nitrogen abundance\nscales with that of iron in the metallicity range -0.6 <[Fe/H]< +0.4 with the\nslope 1.08 \\pm 0.05. Our results show that the bulk of nitrogen production at\nhigh metallicities was coupled with iron. We found that the nitrogen abundance\ndistribution in stars with exoplanets is the high [Fe/H] extension of the curve\ntraced by the comparison sample of stars with no known planets. A comparison of\nour nitrogen abundances with those available in the literature shows a good\nagreement.\n", "  Stochastic acceleration of electrons and protons by waves propagating\nparallel to the large scale magnetic fields of magnetized plasmas is studied\nwith emphasis on the feasibility of accelerating particles from a thermal\nbackground to relativistic energies and with the aim of determining the\nrelative acceleration of the two species in one source. In general, the\nstochastic acceleration by these waves results in two distinct components in\nthe particle distributions, a quasi-thermal and a hard nonthermal, with the\nnonthermal one being more prominent in hotter plasmas and/or with higher level\nturbulence. This can explain many of the observed features of solar flares.\nRegarding the proton to electron ratio, we include the effects of $^4$He in the\ndispersion relation and the damping of the turbulent waves by the thermal\nbackground plasma. The relative acceleration of protons and electrons is very\nsensitive to the ratio of the electron plasma frequency to its gyro-frequency.\nProtons are preferentially accelerated in weakly magnetized plasmas. The\nformalism developed here is applicable to the acceleration of other ion species\nand to other astrophysical systems.\n", "  We present the full spectroscopic white dwarf and hot subdwarf sample from\nthe SDSS first data release, DR1. We find 2551 white dwarf stars of various\ntypes, 240 hot subdwarf stars, and an additional 144 objects we have identified\nas uncertain white dwarf stars. Of the white dwarf stars, 1888 are non-magnetic\nDA types and 171, non-magnetic DBs. The remaining (492) objects consist of all\ndifferent types of white dwarf stars: DO, DQ, DC, DH, DZ, hybrid stars like\nDAB, etc., and those with non-degenerate companions. We fit the DA and DB\nspectra with a grid of models to determine the Teff and log(g) for each object.\nFor all objects, we provide coordinates, proper motions, SDSS photometric\nmagnitudes, and enough information to retrieve the spectrum/image from the SDSS\npublic database. This catalog nearly doubles the known sample of\nspectroscopically-identified white dwarf stars. In the DR1 imaged area of the\nsky, we increase the known sample of white dwarf stars by a factor of 8.5. We\nalso comment on several particularly interesting objects in this sample.\n", "  Broad and narrow band images and long slit spectroscopy of IC1182 are\npresented. The broad band images reveal a distorted morphology with a large,\nheavily obscured disk-like structure and several knots in the central region.\nGalactic material, some of it in the form of two tails, is detected well beyond\nthe main body of the galaxy. The second, fainter tail and several knots are\nreported here for the first time. The narrow band images show that the galaxy\nis a powerful emitter. The emission in the main lines extends all over the\ngalaxy, with plumes and arc-like structures seen in H$\\alpha$ at large\ndistances from the center. The uncorrected H$\\alpha$ flux corresponds to\n3.51$\\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 3 times that of Arp 220. The internal\nextinction deduced from the Balmer decrement is high all along the slit, with\nE$_{B-V}\\approx$ 1. There are no clear signs of nuclear activity and the\nobserved line ratios can be explained in terms of stellar photoionization. The\nmetallicity of the gas in the two brightest central knots is low, 0.1\nZ$_{\\odot}$ and 0.06 Z$_{\\odot}$ respectively. In the main body of the galaxy,\nbesides the reported knots, the distribution of the ionized gas resembles that\nof an inclined disk about 12 kpc in size. The rotation pattern is complex and\ncorresponds to two identifiable disk galaxies with observed rotation amplitudes\nof 200 \\kms and 100 \\kms respectively. The data presented here indicate that IC\n1182 is a high luminosity starburst system, involving two systems in the\nprocess of merging, with two tidal tails emerging from the central region of\nthe galaxy.\n", "  Stochastic acceleration of $^3$He and $^4$He from a thermal background by\nparallel propagating turbulent plasma waves with a single power-law spectrum of\nthe wavenumber is studied. In the model, both ions interact with several\nresonant modes. When one of these modes dominates, the acceleration rate is\nreduced considerably. At low energies, this happens for $^4$He, but not for\n$^3$He where contributions from the two stronger modes are comparable so that\nacceleration of $^3$He is very efficient. As a result, the acceleration of\n$^4$He is suppressed by a barrier below $\\sim 100$ keV nucleon$^{-1}$ and there\nis a prominent quasi-thermal component in the $^4$He spectra, while almost all\nthe injected $^3$He ions are accelerated to high energies. This accounts for\nthe large enrichment of $^3$He at high energies observed in impulsive solar\nenergetic particle events. With reasonable plasma parameters this also provides\na good fit to the spectra of both ions. Beyond $\\sim 1$ MeV nucleon$^{-1}$, the\nspectrum of $^3$He is softer than that of $^4$He, which is consistent with the\nobserved decrease of the $^3$He to $^4$He ratio with energy. This study also\nindicates that the acceleration, Coulomb losses and diffusive escape of the\nparticles from the acceleration site {\\it all} play important roles in shaping\nthe ion spectra. This can explain the varied spectral shapes observed recently\nby the {\\it Advanced Composition Explorer}.\n", "  We present new broad-band optical and near-infrared CCD imaging together with\ndeep optical intermediate-resolution spectroscopy of the Hickson Compact Group\n31. We analyze the morphology and colors of the stellar populations of the\ngalaxies, as well as the kinematics, physical conditions and chemical\ncomposition of the ionized gas in order to get a more complete view on the\norigin and evolution of the system. We estimate the ages of the most recent\nstar formation bursts of the system, finding an excellent consistency among the\nvalues obtained with different indicators and starburst models. We find that\nmember F hosts the youngest starburst of the group, showing a substantial\npopulation of Wolf-Rayet stars. The chemical abundances are fairly similar in\nall the members of the group despite their very different absolute magnitudes.\nWe argue that the use of traditional metallicity-luminosity relations based on\nthe absolute $B$-magnitude is not appropriate for dwarf starburst galaxies,\nbecause their luminosity is dominated by the transient contribution of the\nstarburst to the blue luminosity. We think that members E and F of the group\nare candidate tidal dwarf galaxies because of their high metallicity, their\nkinematics, and the absence of underlying old stellar populations. Finally, we\npropose that HCG~31 is suffering several almost simultaneous interaction\nprocesses. The most relevant of these processes are: (a) the merging of members\nA and C, that would have produced two optical tidal tails; and (b) a fly-by\nencounter between G and the A+C complex, that would have produced an \\ion{H}{1}\ntidal tail from the stripping of the external gas of A+C, from which members F\nand E have originated.\n", "  We present deep unbiased spectroscopy of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF)\ncarried out using the slitless grism spectroscopy mode of the Advance Camera\nfor Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The GRIsm ACS Program for\nExtragalactic Science (GRAPES) achieves continuum detection as faint as\n$z_{AB}=27.2$ using 40 orbits ($9.2 \\times 10^4$ seconds) on HST. The data were\ntaken at four orientation angles to correct for the overlap of spectra. GRAPES\ndata provide a unique, uninterrupted, low resolution (R=100) spectral coverage\nfor $5500\\AA < \\lambda < 10500\\AA$, and allow us to detect high redshift\ngalaxies at $4 < z < 7$ whether they have $\\lya$ lines or just show the Lyman\nBreak, as well as find low luminosity AGNs in an unbiased fashion. This paper\ndescribes in detail the observations and the data reduction, and examines the\nquality of the extracted spectra. Subsequent papers will deal with the analysis\nof the data. The extracted and calibrated GRAPES spectra will be available from\nMAST at STScI.\n", "  We present results of an analysis of the structural and kinematical\nproperties of a sample of elliptical-like objects (ELOs) identified in four\nhydrodynamical, self-consistent simulations run with the DEVA code (Serna et\nal. 2003). Star formation has been implemented in the code through a simple\nphenomenological parameterization, that takes into account stellar physics\nprocesses only implicitly through the values of a threshold gas density,\n$\\rho_{\\rm g,thres}$, and an efficiency parameter, $c_*$. The four simulations\noperate in the context of a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model consistent with\nobservations, resolve ELO mass assembly at scales up to $\\simeq$ 2 kpc, and\ndiffer in the values of their star formation parameters. Stellar masses,\nprojected half-mass radii and central l.o.s. velocity dispersions, $\\sigma_{\\rm\nlos, 0}$, have been measured on the ELO sample and their values compared with\ndata from the Sloan digital sky survey. For the first time in self-consistent\nsimulations, a good degree of agreement has been shown, including the\nFaber-Jackson and the $D_n - \\sigma_{\\rm los, 0}$ relations, among others, but\nonly when particular values of the $\\rho_{\\rm g,thres}$ and $c_*$ parameters\nare used. This demostrates the effect that the star formation parameterization\nhas on the ELO mass distribution. Additionally, our results suggest that it is\nnot strictly necessary, at the scales resolved in this work, to appeal to\nenergy sources other than gravitational (as for example supernovae feedback\neffects) to account for the structure and kinematics of large ellipticals.\n", "  We study an example of instability in presence of a multiplicative noise,\nnamely the spontaneous generation of a magnetic field in a turbulent medium.\nThis so-called turbulent dynamo problem remains challenging, experimentally and\ntheoretically. In this field, the prevailing theory is the Mean-Field Dynamo\n(Krause and R\\\"{a}dler, 1980) where the dynamo effect is monitored by the mean\nmagnetic field (other possible choices would be the energy, flux,...). In\nrecent years, it has been shown on stochastic oscillators that this type of\napproach could be misleading. In this paper, we develop a stochastic\ndescription of the turbulent dynamo effect which permits us to define\nunambiguously a threshold for the dynamo effect, namely by globally analyzing\nthe probability density function of the magnetic field instead of a given\nmoment.\n", "  A linear but global numerical model for the magnetorotational instability\n(MRI) in disk geometry is considered to estimate the instability parameters for\ngalaxies. Similarity rules suggested by a local analysis are applied to reveal\na universal behavior approached by the results of global calculations for large\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers. The findings are used to estimate the MRI\ncharacteristics for galaxies with their very large magnetic Prandtl numbers\nwhich cannot be attained in any numerical simulations. The resulting minimum\nfield for the instability, Bmin 10-25 G, is small compared to any seed fields\ncurrently discussed. The growth times of MRI are estimated to be on the order\nof the rotation period of the inner rigidly-rotating core, i.e. ~100 Myr.\nGlobal MRI excites preferentially the magnetic field modes of quadrupolar\nsymmetry.\n", "  We present a natural mechanism which may induce an electric charge into an\naccretting black hole in the presence of a strong, high energy radiation field.\nWe study this mechanism using Newtonian physics, and we also discuss the\nprocess within the context of a Kerr Newman black hole. Finally, we consider\npossible astrophysical applications in X-ray variability and jet formation in\nthe Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).\n", "  We have detected longitudinal magnetic fields between 2 and 4 kG in three (WD\n0446$-$790, WD 1105$-$048, WD 2359$-$434) out of a sample of 12 normal DA white\ndwarfs by using optical spectropolarimetry done with the VLT Antu 8 m telescope\nequipped with FORS1. With the exception of 40 Eri B (4 kG) these are the first\npositive detections of magnetic fields in white dwarfs below 30 kG. Although\nsuspected, it was not clear whether a significant fraction of white dwarfs\ncontain magnetic fields at this level. These fields may be explained as fossil\nrelics from magnetic fields in the main-sequence progenitors considerably\nenhanced by magnetic flux conservation during the shrinkage of the core. A\ndetection rate of 25 % (3/12) may indicate now for the first time that a\nsubstantial fraction of white dwarfs have a weak magnetic field. This result,\nif confirmed by future observations, would form a cornerstone for our\nunderstanding on the evolution of stellar magnetic fields.\n  Keywords: stars: white dwarfs - stars: magnetic fields - stars: individual:\nWD0446-790, WD1105-048, WD2359-434\n", "  The accepted explanation of the observed dichotomy of two orders of magnitude\nbetween in situ measurements of electron density in HII regions, derived from\nemission line ratios, and average measurements based on integrated emission\nmeasure, is the inhomogeneity of the ionized medium. This is expressed as a\n\"filling factor\", the volume ratio of dense to tenuous gas, measured with\nvalues of order 10^-3. Implicit in the filling factor model as normally used,\nis the assumption that the clumps of dense gas are optically thin to ionizing\nradiation. Here we explore implications of assuming the contrary: that the\nclumps are optically thick. A first consequence is the presence within HII\nregions of a major fraction of neutral hydrogen. We estimate the mean H^o/H^+\nratio for a population of HII regions in the spiral galaxy NGC 1530 to be the\norder of 10, and support this inference using dynamical arguments. The\noptically thick clumpy models allow a significant fraction of the photons\ngenerated by the ionizing stars to escape from their HII region. We show, by\ncomparing model predictions with observations, that these models give an\naccount at least as good as, and probably better than that of conventional\nmodels, of the radial surface brightness distribution and of selected spectral\nline diagnostics for physical conditions within HII regions. These models\nexplain how an HII region can appear, from its line ratios, to be ionization\nbounded, yet permit a major fraction of its ionizing photons to escape.\n", "  In the first part of this article we show how observations of the chemical\nevolution of the Galaxy: G- and K-dwarf numbers as functions of metallicity,\nand abundances of the light elements, D, Li, Be and B, in both stars and the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), lead to the conclusion that metal poor HI gas has\nbeen accreting to the Galactic disc during the whole of its lifetime, and is\naccreting today at a measurable rate, ~2 Msun per year across the full disc.\nEstimates of the local star formation rate (SFR) using methods based on stellar\nactivity, support this picture. The best fits to all these data are for models\nwhere the accretion rate is constant, or slowly rising with epoch. We explain\nhere how this conclusion, for a galaxy in a small bound group, is not in\nconflict with graphs such as the Madau plot, which show that the universal SFR\nhas declined steadily from z=1 to the present day. We also show that a model in\nwhich disc galaxies in general evolve by accreting major clouds of low\nmetallicity gas from their surroundings can explain many observations, notably\nthat the SFR for whole galaxies tends to show obvious variability, and\nfractionally more for early than for late types, and yields lower dark to\nbaryonic matter ratios for large disc galaxies than for dwarfs. In the second\npart of the article we use NGC 1530 as a template object, showing from\nFabry-Perot observations of its Halpha emission how strong shear in this\nstrongly barred galaxy acts to inhibit star formation, while compression acts\nto stimulate it.\n", "  We have analyzed HST and ground-based data to characterize the different gas\nphases and their interaction with the MYC in NGC 604, a GHR in M33. The warm\nionized gas is made out of two components: a high-excitation, high-surface\nbrightness H II surface located at the faces of the molecular clouds directly\nexposed to the ionizing radiation of the central SOBA; and a low-excitation,\nlow-surface brightness halo that extends to much larger distances from the\nionizing stars. The cavities created by the winds and SN explosions are filled\nwith X-ray-emitting coronal gas. The nebular lines emitted by the warm gas\nexperience a variable attenuation as a consequence of the dust distribution,\nwhich is patchy in the plane of the sky and with clouds interspersed among\nemission-line sources in the same line of sight. The optical depth at H alpha\nas measured from the ratio of the thermal radio continuum to H alpha shows a\nvery good correlation with the total CO (1-0) column, indicating that most of\nthe dust resides in the cold molecular phase. The optical depth at H alpha as\nmeasured from the ratio of H alpha to H beta also correlates with the CO\nemission but not as strongly as in the previous case. We analyze the difference\nbetween those two measurements and we find that <=11% of the H II gas is hidden\nbehind large-optical-depth molecular clouds. We detect two candidate compact H\nII regions embedded inside the molecular cloud; both are within short distance\nof WR/Of stars and one of them is located within 16 pc of a RSG. We estimate\nthe age of the main stellar generation in NGC 604 to be approx. 3 Myr from the\nionization structure of the H II region. The size of the main cavity is smaller\nthan the one predicted by extrapolating from single-star wind-blown bubbles.\n", "  We present optical and NIR (near infrared) follow up observations of the GRB\n001109 from 1 to 300 days after the burst. No transient emission was found at\nthese wavelengths within this GRB's (Gamma Ray Burst) 50\" radius BeppoSAX error\nbox. Strong limits (3 sigma) are set with: R >~ 21, 10.2 hr after the GRB; I >~\n23, 11.4 hr after the GRB; H >~ 20.7, 9.9 hr after the GRB; and Ks >~ 20, 9.6\nhours after the GRB. We discuss whether the radio source found in the GRB's\nerror box (Taylor et al. 2000) might be related to the afterglow. We also\npresent a multiwavelength study of a reddened starburst galaxy, found\ncoincident with the potential radio and the X ray afterglow. We show that our\nstrong I band upper limit makes of the GRB 001109 the darkest one localised by\nthe BeppoSAX's NFI (Narrow Field Instrument), and it is one of the most\nconstraining upper limits on GRB afterglows to date. Further to it, the\nimplications of these observations in the context of dark GRBs are considered.\n", "  ISO/LWS grating observations of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy Arp 220\nshows absorption in molecular lines of OH, H$_2$O, CH, NH, and NH$_3$, as well\nas in the [O I] 63 $\\mu$m line and emission in the [C II] 158 $\\mu$m line. We\nhave modeled the continuum and the emission/absorption of all observed features\nby means of a non-local radiative transfer code. The continuum from 25 to 1300\n$\\mu$m is modeled as a warm (106 K) nuclear region that is optically thick in\nthe far-infrared, attenuated by an extended region (size 2$''$) that is heated\nmainly through absorption of nuclear infrared radiation. The molecular\nabsorption in the nuclear region is characterized by high excitation due to the\nhigh infrared radiation density. The OH column densities are high toward the\nnucleus and the extended region. The H$_2$O column density is also high toward\nthe nucleus and lower in the extended region. The column densities in a halo\nare similar to what are found in the diffuse clouds toward Sgr B2 near the\nGalactic Center. Most notable are the high column densities found for NH and\nNH$_3$ toward the nucleus, with values of $\\sim1.5\\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and\n$\\sim3\\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. A combination of PDRs in the\nextended region and hot cores with enhanced \\hdo photodissociation and a\npossible shock contribution in the nuclei may explain the relative column\ndensities of OH and \\hdo, whereas the nitrogen chemistry may be strongly\naffected by cosmic ray ionization. The [C II] 158 $\\mu$m line is well\nreproduced by our models and its ``deficit'' relative to the CII/FIR ratio in\nnormal and starburst galaxies is suggested to be mainly a consequence of the\ndominant non-PDR component of far-infrared radiation, although our models alone\ncannot rule out extinction effects in the nuclei.\n", "  L'-band (lambda=3.8 microns) and M'-band (lambda=4.8 microns) observations of\nthe Galactic Center region, performed in 2003 at VLT (ESO) with the adaptive\noptics imager NACO, have lead to the detection of an infrared counterpart of\nthe radio source Sgr A* at both wavelengths. The measured fluxes confirm that\nthe Sgr A* infrared spectrum is dominated by the synchrotron emission of\nnonthermal electrons. The infrared counterpart exhibits no significant short\nterm variability but demonstrates flux variations on daily and yearly scales.\nThe observed emission arises away from the position of the dynamical center of\nthe S2 orbit and would then not originate from the closest regions of the black\nhole.\n", "  We report results from a comprehensive follow-up observing campaign of the\nafterglow of GRB 030226, including VLT spectroscopy, VLT polarimetry, and\nChandra X-ray observations. In addition, we present BOOTES-1 wide-field\nobservations at the time of the occurrence of the burst. First observations at\nESO started 0.2 days after the event when the GRB afterglow was at a magnitude\nof R~19 and continued until the afterglow had faded below the detection\nthreshold (R>26). No underlying host galaxy was found. The optical light curve\nshows a break around 0.8 days after the burst, which is achromatic within the\nobservational errors, supporting the view that it was due to a jetted\nexplosion. Close to the break time the degree of linear polarization of the\nafterglow light was less than 1.1%, which favors a uniform jet model rather\nthan a structured one. VLT spectra show two absorption line systems at\nredshifts z=1.962+/-0.001 and at z=1.986+/-0.001, placing the lower limit for\nthe redshift of the GRB close to 2. We emphasize that the kinematics and the\ncomposition of the absorbing clouds responsible for these line systems is very\nsimilar to those observed in the afterglow of GRB 021004. This corroborates the\npicture in which at least some GRBs are physically related to the explosion of\na Wolf-Rayet star.\n", "  The rapid dissemination of an arcmin-sized HETE-2 localization of the\nlong-duration X-ray flash GRB 030528 led to a ground-based multi-observatory\nfollow-up campaign. We report the discovery of the near-IR afterglow, and also\ndescribe the detection of the underlying host galaxy in the optical and near-IR\nbands. The afterglow is classified as \"optically dark\" as it was not detected\nin the optical band. The K-band photometry presented here suggests that the\nlack of optical detection was simply the result of observational limitations\n(lack of rapid and deep observations plus high foreground extinction). Simple\npower law fits to the afterglow in the K-band suggest a typically decay with a\nslope of alpha=1.2. The properties of the host are consistent with the idea\nthat GRB hosts are star forming blue galaxies. The redshift of GRB 030528 can\nnot be determined accurately, but the data favour redshifts less than unity. In\naddition, we present an optical and near-IR analysis of the X-ray source CXOU\nJ170354.0--223654 from the vicinity of GRB 030528.\n", "  We present the Capodimonte Deep Field (OACDF), a deep field covering an area\nof 0.5 square degrees in the B, V, R optical bands plus six medium-band filters\nin the wavelength range 773--913 nm. The field reaches the following limiting\nAB magnitudes: B~25.3, V~24.8 and R~25.1 and contains about 50000 extended\nsources in the AB magnitude range 18 < R < 25 . Hence, it is intermediate\nbetween deep pencil beam surveys and very wide but shallow surveys. The main\nscientific goal of the OACDF is the identification and characterization of\nearly-type field galaxies at different look-back times in order to study\ndifferent scenarios of galaxy formation. Parallel goals include the search for\ngroups and clusters of galaxies and the search for rare and peculiar objects\n(gravitational lenses, QSOs, halo White Dwarfs). In this paper we describe the\nOACDF data reduction, the methods adopted for the extraction of the photometric\ncatalogs, the photometric calibration and the quality assessment of the\ncatalogs by means of galaxy number counts, spectroscopic and photometric\nredshifts and star colors. We also present the first results of the search for\ngalaxy overdensities. The depth of the OACDF and its relatively large spatial\ncoverage with respect to pencil beam surveys make it a good tool for further\nstudies of galaxy formation and evolution in the redshift range 0--1, as well\nas for stellar studies.\n", "  We report limits on the Galactic foreground emission contribution to the\nBackground Emission Anisotropy Scanning Telescope (BEAST) Ka- and Q-band CMB\nanisotropy maps. We estimate the contribution from the cross-correlations\nbetween these maps and the foreground emission templates of an H${\\alpha}$ map,\na de-striped version of the Haslam et al. 408 MHz map, and a combined 100\n$\\mu$m IRAS/DIRBE map. Our analysis samples the BEAST $\\sim10^\\circ$\ndeclination band into 24 one-hour (RA) wide sectors with $\\sim7900$ pixels\neach, where we calculate: (a) the linear correlation coefficient between the\nanisotropy maps and the templates; (b) the coupling constants between the\nspecific intensity units of the templates and the antenna temperature at the\nBEAST frequencies and (c) the individual foreground contributions to the BEAST\nanisotropy maps. The peak sector contributions of the contaminants in the\nKa-band are of 56.5% free-free with a coupling constant of $8.3\\pm0.4$\n$\\mu$K/R, and 67.4% dust with $45.0\\pm2.0$ $\\mu$K/(MJy/sr). In the Q-band the\ncorresponding values are of 64.4% free-free with $4.1\\pm0.2$ $\\mu$K/R and 67.5%\ndust with $24.0\\pm1.0$ $\\mu$K/(MJy/sr). Using a lower limit of 10% in the\nrelative uncertainty of the coupling constants, we can constrain the sector\ncontributions of each contaminant in both maps to $< 20$% in 21 (free-free), 19\n(dust) and 22 (synchrotron) sectors. At this level, all these sectors are found\noutside of the $\\mid$b$\\mid = 14.6^\\circ$ region. By performing the same\ncorrelation analysis as a function of Galactic scale height, we conclude that\nthe region within $b=\\pm17.5^{\\circ}$ should be removed from the BEAST maps for\nCMB studies in order to keep individual Galactic contributions below $\\sim 1$%\nof the map's rms.\n", "  We report on a dedicated effort to identify and study metal-poor stars\nstrongly enhanced in r-process elements ([r/Fe] > 1 dex; hereafter r-II stars),\nthe Hamburg/ESO R-process Enhanced Star survey (HERES). Moderate-resolution\n(~2A) follow-up spectroscopy has been obtained for metal-poor giant candidates\nselected from the Hamburg/ESO objective-prism survey (HES) as well as the HK\nsurvey to identify sharp-lined stars with [Fe/H] < -2.5dex. For several hundred\nconfirmed metal-poor giants brighter than B~16.5mag (most of them from the\nHES), ``snapshot'' spectra (R~20,000; S/N~30 per pixel) are being obtained with\nVLT/UVES, with the main aim of finding the 2-3% r-II stars expected to be among\nthem. These are studied in detail by means of higher resolution and higher S/N\nspectra. In this paper we describe a pilot study based on a set of 35 stars,\nincluding 23 from the HK survey, 8 from the HES, and 4 comparison stars. We\ndiscovered two new r-II stars, CS29497-004 ([Eu/Fe] = 1.64 +/- 0.22) and\nCS29491-069 ([Eu/Fe] = 1.08 +/- 0.23). A first abundance analysis of\nCS29497-004 yields that its abundances of Ba to Dy are on average enhanced by\n1.5dex with respect to iron and the Sun and match a scaled solar r-process\npattern well, while Th is underabundant relative to that pattern by 0.3dex,\nwhich we attribute to radioactive decay. That is, CS29497-004 seems not to\nbelong to the class of r-process enhanced stars displaying an ``actinide\nboost'', like CS31082-001 (Hill et al. 2002), or CS30306-132 (Honda et al.\n2004b). The abundance pattern agrees well with predictions of the\nphenomenological model of Qian & Wasserburg.\n", "  In this work a neutrino gas in equilibrium is studied both at T=0 and at\nfinite temperature. Neutrinos are treated as massive Dirac quasi-particles with\ntwo generations. We include self-interactions among the neutrinos via neutral\ncurrents, as well as the interaction with a background of matter. To obtain the\nequilibrium properties we use Wigner function techniques. To account for\ncorrections beyond the Hartree approximation, we also introduce correlation\nfunctions. We prove that, under the quasi-particle approximation, these\ncorrelation functions can be expressed as products of Wigner functions. We\nanalyze the main properties of the neutrino eigenmodes in the medium, such as\neffective masses and mixing angle. We show that the formulae describing these\nquantities will differ with respect to the case with no self-interactions.\n", "  We present new sensitive wide-band measurements of the fine structure line\n3^P_1 -> 3^P_0 (J=1-0, 492GHz) of neutral atomic carbon (CI) in the two typical\nUltra Luminous Infrared Galaxies NGC6240 and Arp220. We then use them along\nwith several other CI measurements in similar objects found in the literature\nto estimate their global molecular gas content under the assumption of a full\nCI-H_2 concomitance. We find excellent agreement between the H_2 gas mass\nestimated with this method and the standard methods using 12^CO. This may\nprovide a new way to measure H_2 gas mass in galaxies, and one which may be\nvery valuable in ULIRGs since in such systems the bright 12^CO emission is\nknown to systematically overestimate the gas mass while their 13^CO emission is\nusually very weak. At redshifts z>=1 the CI J=1-0 line shifts to much more\nfavorable atmospheric windows and can become a viable alternative tracer of the\nH_2 gas fueling starburst events in the distant Universe.\n", "  Recent results from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have resolved starbursts as\ncollections of compact young stellar clusters. Here we present a photometric\ncatalogue of the young stellar clusters in the nuclear starburst of M82,\nobserved with the HST WFPC2 in Halpha (F656N) and in four optical broad-band\nfilters. We identify 197 young super stellar clusters. The compactness and high\ndensity of the sources led us to develop specific techniques to measure their\nsizes. Strong extinction lanes divide the starburst into five different zones\nand we provide a catalogue of young super star clusters for each of these. In\nthe catalogue we include relative coordinates, radii, fluxes, luminosities,\nmasses, equivalent widths, extinctions, and other parameters. Extinction values\nhave been derived from the broad-band images. The radii range between 3 and 9\npc, with a mean value of 5.7 +/- 1.4pc, and a stellar mass between 10e4 and\n10e6 Mo. The inferred masses and mean separation, comparable to the size of\nsuper star clusters, together with their high volume density, provides strong\nevidence for the key ingredients postulated by Tenorio et al. (2003) as\nrequired for the development of a supergalactic wind.\n", "  Short period sdB binaries with cool companions are crucial to understand\npre-CV evolution, because they will evolve into cataclysmic variables, when the\nsdB will have left the extended horizontal branch. Recently we discovered the\nsixth such system, HS 2333+3927, consisting of an sdB star and an M dwarf\n(period: 0.172 d) with a very strong reflection effect, but no eclipses. The\nreflection is stronger than in any of the other similar systems which renders a\nquantitative spectral analysis very difficult because the Balmer line profiles\nmay be disturbed by the reflected light. A spectroscopic analysis results in\nTeff = 36500 K, log g = 5.70, and log (n_He/n_H) = -2.15. Mass-radius relations\nwere derived from the results of the analysis of light and radial-velocity\ncurves. Comparison with the mass-radius relation derived from the surface\ngravity of the sdB star favours a rather low mass of 0.38 Msun for the primary.\nThe mass of the companion is 0.29 M_sun. HS 2333+3927 is the only known sdB+dM\nsystem with a period above the CV period gap.\n", "  Based on observations of the most abundant sulfur-bearing molecules (H2S, CS,\nNS, SO, H2CS, OCS, and SO2) carried out with the IRAM 30m telescope and SEST,\nwe present the first analysis of the sulfur chemistry of an extragalactic\nsource, the nuclear region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253. This is the first\ntime that H2S and, tentatively, H2CS are detected towards the nucleus of a\nstarburst galaxy. Source averaged fractional abundances of these molecules are\na few 10^-9, except for CS and OCS which are more abundant (10^-8). Sulfur\nisotopic ratios, 32S/34S~8+-2 and 34S/33S>9, are measured through observations\nof 13CS, C34S, and C33S. A comparison with the observed relative abundances\ntowards different prototypical Galactic sources suggests that the chemical\ncomposition of NGC 253 is similar to that found towards the molecular clouds\ncomplexes like Sgr B2 in the nuclear region of the Milky Way. The large\noverabundance of OCS compared to the predictions of time-dependent sulfur\nchemistry models supports the idea that OCS is likely injected into the gas\nphase from the grain mantles by low velocity shocks.\n", "  Measurement of cosmic microwave background polarization is today a major goal\nof observational cosmology. The level of the signal to measure, however, makes\nit very sensitive to various systematic effects. In the case of Planck, which\nmeasures polarization by combining data from various detectors, the beam\nasymmetry can induce a temperature leakage or a polarization mode mixing. In\nthis paper, we investigate this effect using realistic simulated beams and\npropose a first-order method to correct the polarization power spectra for the\ninduced systematic effect.\n", "  In this note, we report the results of a simulation of the galactic component\nof high energy gamma rays, as seen by the future AMS-02 experiment on-board the\nInternational Space Station. The purpose of AMS is to measure the Cosmic Ray\nspectra of numerous particles with unprecedented accuracy. This simulation has\nbeen performed with the GALPROP code and its output interfaced with the AMS\nFast Simulator, to produce a sky-map of yearly counts in the AMS energy range\n(over 1 GeV).\n", "  For the first time we have directly detected magnetic fields in central stars\nof planetary nebulae by means of spectro-polarimetry with FORS1 at the VLT. In\nall four objects of our sample we found kilogauss magnetic fields, in NGC1360\nand LSS1362 with very high significance, while in EGB5 and Abell36 the\nexistence of a magnetic field is probable but with less certainty. This\ndiscovery supports the hypothesis that the non-spherical symmetry of most\nplanetary nebulae is caused by magnetic fields in AGB stars. Our high discovery\nrate demands mechanisms to prevent full conservation of magnetic flux during\nthe transition to white dwarfs.\n", "  The emission line luminosity function of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is\nmeasured from about 3000 AGN included in the main galaxy sample of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey within a redshift range of $0<z<0.15$. The $\\Ha$ and\n[OIII]$\\lambda 5007$ luminosity functions for Seyferts cover luminosity range\nof $10^{5-9}$$L_\\odot$ in H$\\alpha$ and the shapes are well fit by broken power\nlaws, without a turnover at fainter nuclear luminosities. Assuming a universal\nconversion from emission line strength to continuum luminosity, the inferred B\nband magnitude luminosity function is comparable both to the AGN luminosity\nfunction of previous studies and to the low redshift quasar luminosity function\nderived from the 2dF redshift survey. The inferred AGN number density is\napproximately 1/5 of all galaxies and about $6\\times 10^{-3}$ of the total\nlight of galaxies in the $r$-band comes from the nuclear activity. The numbers\nof Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s are comparable at low luminosity, while at high\nluminosity, Seyfert 1s outnumber Seyfert 2s by a factor of 2-4. In making the\nluminosity function measurements, we assumed that the nuclear luminosity is\nindependent of the host galaxy luminosity, an assumption we test {\\it a\nposteriori}, and show to be consistent with the data. Given the relationship\nbetween black hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, the lack of\ncorrelation between nuclear and host luminosity suggests that the main variable\nthat determines the AGN luminosity is the Eddington ratio, not the black hole\nmass. This appears to be different from luminous quasars, which are most likely\nto be shining near the Eddington limit.\n", "  We have compiled a large sample of low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nidentified via their emission line characteristics from the spectroscopic data\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Since emission lines are often contaminated by\nstellar absorption lines, we developed an objective and efficient method of\nsubtracting the stellar continuum from every galaxy spectrum before making\nemission line measurements. The distribution of the measured H$\\alpha$ Full\nWidth at Half Maxima values of emission line galaxies is strongly bimodal, with\ntwo populations separated at about 1,200km s$^{-1}$. This feature provides a\nnatural separation between narrow-line and broad-line AGN. The narrow-line AGN\nare identified using standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. 1,317\nbroad-line and 3,074 narrow-line AGN are identified from about 100,000 galaxy\nspectra selected over 1151 square degrees. This sample is used in a companion\npaper to determine the emission-line luminosity function of AGN.\n", "  UV, optical, and near-IR spectra of Vega have been combined to test our\nunderstanding of stellar atmospheric opacities, and to examine the possibility\nof constraining chemical abundances from low-resolution UV fluxes. We have\ncarried out a detailed analysis assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE)\nto identify the most important contributors to the UV continuous opacity: H,\nH$^{-}$, C I, and Si II. Our analysis also assumes that Vega is spherically\nsymmetric and its atmosphere is well described with the plane parallel\napproximation. Comparing observations and computed fluxes we have been able to\ndiscriminate between two different flux scales that have been proposed, the\nIUE-INES and the HST scales, favoring the latter. The effective temperature and\nangular diameter derived from the analysis of observed optical and near-UV\nspectra are in very good agreement with previous determinations based on\ndifferent techniques. The silicon abundance is poorly constrained by the UV\nobservations of the continuum and strong lines, but the situation is more\nfavorable for carbon and the abundances inferred from the UV continuum and\noptical absorption lines are in good agreement. Some spectral intervals in the\nUV spectrum of Vega that the calculations do not reproduce well are likely\naffected by deviations from LTE, but we conclude that our understanding of UV\natmospheric opacities is fairly complete for early A-type stars.\n", "  Using VLTI/VINCI angular diameter measurements, we constrain the evolutionary\nstatus of three asteroseismic targets: the stars $\\delta$ Eri, $\\xi$ Hya,\n$\\eta$ Boo. Our predictions of the mean large frequency spacing of these stars\nare in agreement with published observational estimations. Looking without\nsuccess for a companion of $\\delta$ Eri we doubt on its classification as an RS\nCVn star.\n", "  A 10-night asteroseismic observation programme has been conducted in January\n2004 with the spectrometer Harps at the ES0 3.6-m telescope. The selected\ntarget, the 6th magnitude F5V star HD 49933, was chosen among the prime\ncandidates of Corot, the European space mission dedicated to characterize\nstellar oscillations mode with high precision photometry measurements. This\nstar shows important line profiles variations, indicating a surprisingly high\nactivity with respect to its low rotation rate. However, with the help of tools\ndeveloped for disentangling the signatures of activity and oscillations, we are\nable to observe its oscillation spectrum in the frequency range [1.2, 2.2 mHz].\nWe measure the large separation (88.7+-0.4 microHz) and the maximum amplitude\n(around 0.4+-0.1 m/s rms), respectively in agreement and marginal agreement\nwith the predicted values.\n", "  We present a catalogue of astrophysical data of 520 Galactic open clusters.\nThese are the clusters, for which at least three most probable members (18 on\naverage) could be identified in the ASCC-2.5, a catalogue of stars based on the\nTycho-2 observations from the Hipparcos mission. We applied homogeneous methods\nand algorithms to determine angular sizes of cluster cores and coronae,\nheliocentric distances, mean proper motions, mean radial velocities and ages.\nFor the first time we derive distances for 200 clusters, radial velocities for\n94 clusters and determine ages of 196 clusters. This homogeneous new parameter\nset is compared with earlier determinations. In particular, we find that the\nangular sizes were systematically underestimated in the literature.\n", "  We have compiled a sample of 2728 nearby ($z<0.08$) elliptical galaxies with\nphotometry in the $g,r,i,z$ bands from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and\n$J,H,K$ photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Stellar masses,\nstellar velocity dispersions and structural parameters such as sizes and\nsurface mass densities are also available for these objects. In order to\ncorrect the aperture mismatch between SDSS and 2MASS, we correct the SDSS\nmagnitudes to the isophotal circular radius where the 2MASS magnitudes are\nmeasured. We compare the correlations between optical, optical-infrared and\ninfrared colours and galaxy luminosity, stellar mass, velocity dispersion and\nsurface mass density. We find that all galaxy colours correlate more strongly\nwith stellar mass and velocity dispersion than with any other structural\nparameter. The dispersion about these two relations is also smaller.\n  We also study the correlations between a variety of stellar absorption line\nindices and the same set of galaxy parameters and we reach very similar\nconclusions. Finally, we analyze correlations between absorption line indices\nand colour. Our results suggest that the optical colours of elliptical galaxies\nare sensitive to a combination of age, metallicity and $\\alpha$-enhancement,\nwhile the optical-infrared colours are sensitive to metallicity and to\n$\\alpha$-enhancement, but are somewhat less sensitive to age.\n", "  We report the first results of a systematic search near the plane of the\nGalaxy for the so called very active stars (VAS), which are characterized by a\nhard X-ray spectrum and activity in the radio domain. Candidates with hard\nX-ray binary-like spectra have been selected from the Bright ROSAT Source\nCatalogue in the Zone of Avoidance ($| b | < 20{^o}$) and were tentatively\nidentified in GB6/PMM/NVSS radio surveys. Most of them were observed with the\nATCA and VLA. Precise radio coordinates have led to unambiguous optical\nidentification for 60 candidates, and a sub-sample of five of themhas been\nobserved with the VLT. Also some discovery and confirmatory spectra were\nobtained with the AAT (4-m) and BTA (6-m). Spectroscopy with moderate\ndispersion, made with the FORS1 spectrograph of the VLT has revealed two\nstellar objects (one of them, VASC J1628-41, is definitivelya binary VAS), one\nnew AGN and two featureless spectrum sources. One of these objects, VASC\nJ1353-66, shows a marginal evidence of proper motion, which, if confirmed,\nwould imply the discovery of a new type of galactic source.\n", "  We study the acceleration in solar flares of $^3$He and $^4$He from a thermal\nbackground by parallel propagating plasma waves with a general broken power-law\nspectrum that takes into account the turbulence generation processes at large\nscales and the thermal damping effects at small scales. The exact dispersion\nrelation for a cold plasma is used to describe the relevant wave modes. Because\nlow-energy $\\alpha$-particles only interact with small scale waves in the\n$^4$He-cyclotron branch, where the wave frequencies are below the\n$\\alpha$-particle gyro-frequency, their pitch angle averaged acceleration time\nis at least one order of magnitude longer than that of $^3$He ions, which\nmostly resonate with relatively higher frequency waves in the proton-cyclotron\n(PC) branch. The $\\alpha$-particle acceleration rate starts to approach that of\n$^3$He beyond a few tens of keV nucleon$^{-1}$, where $\\alpha$-particles can\nalso interact with long wavelength waves in the PC branch. However, the $^4$He\nacceleration rate is always smaller than that of $^3$He. Consequently, the\nacceleration of $^4$He is suppressed significantly at low energies, and the\nspectrum of the accelerated $\\alpha$-particles is always softer than that of\n$^3$He. The model gives reasonable account of the observed low-energy $^3$He\nand $^4$He fluxes and spectra in the impulsive solar energetic particle events\nobserved with the {\\it Advanced Composition Explorer}. We explore the model\nparameter space to show how observations may be used to constrain the model.\n", "  We present preliminary results of a simultaneous X-ray/optical campaign of\nthe prototypical LMXB Sco X-1 at 1-10 Hz time resolution. Lightcurves of the\nhigh excitation Bowen/HeII emission lines were obtained through narrow\ninterference filters with ULTRACAM, and these were cross-correlated with X-ray\nlightcurves. We find evidence for correlated variability, in particular when\nSco X-1 enters the Flaring Branch. The Bowen/HeII lightcurves lag the X-ray\nlightcurves with a light travel time which is consistent with reprocessing in\nthe companion star.\n", "  Possible dark matter candidates are reviewed as well as indirect search\nmethods based on annihilation or decay channels of these particles. Neutralino\nis presently the best particle candidate and its annihilation produces high\nenergy neutrinos, antiprotons, positrons and gamma-rays. To date, only upper\nlimits on neutrino fluxes from the center of the Earth or the Sun, were\nestablished by different experiments. Antiprotons detected by the BESS\ncollaboration, if issued from the follow up hadronization of the annihilation\nprocess, exclude neutralino masses higher than 100 GeV. The EGRET gamma-ray\nresidual emission seen at high galactic latitudes above 1 GeV could be\nexplained by neutralino annihilations if: i) the dark matter profile is \"cored\"\nand ii) the neutralino mass is < 50 GeV. Sterile neutrinos in the keV mass\nrange are a possible candidate to constitute warm dark matter. These particles\nmay provide an adequate free streaming mass able to solve \"some\" difficulties\npresent in the cold dark matter scenario at small scales and could also explain\nthe natal kick of pulsars. MeV particles, dubbed \"light\" dark matter, proposed\nto explain the extended 511 keV line emission from the galactic center will\nalso be discussed.\n", "  We report new near-infrared, long-baseline interferometric observations at\nthe AU scale of the pre-main-sequence star FU Orionis with the PTI, IOTA and\nVLTI interferometers. This young stellar object has been observed on 42 nights\nover a period of 6 years from 1998 to 2003. We have obtained 287 independent\nmeasurements of the fringe visibility with 6 different baselines ranging from\n20 to 110 meters in length, in the H and K bands. Our extensive (u,v)-plane\ncoverage, coupled with the published spectral energy distribution data, allows\nus to test the accretion disk scenario. We find that the most probable\nexplanation for these observations is that FU Ori hosts an active accretion\ndisk whose temperature law is consistent with standard models. We are able to\nconstrain the geometry of the disk, including an inclination of 55 deg and a\nposition angle of 47 deg. In addition, a 10 percent peak-to-peak oscillation is\ndetected in the data (at the two-sigma level) from the longest baselines, which\nwe interpret as a possible disk hot-spot or companion. However, the oscillation\nin our best data set is best explained with an unresolved spot located at a\nprojected distance of 10 AU at the 130 deg position angle and with a magnitude\ndifference of DeltaK = 3.9 and DeltaH = 3.6 mag moving away from the center at\na rate of 1.2 AU/yr. we propose to interpret this spot as the signature of a\ncompanion of the central FU Ori system on an extremely eccentric orbit. We\nspeculate that the close encounter of this putative companion and the central\nstar could be the explanation of the initial photometric rise of the luminosity\nof this object.\n", "  We present high resolution laboratory spectra of K-shell X-ray lines from\ninner-shell excited and ionized ions of oxygen, obtained with a reflection\ngrating spectrometer on the electron beam ion trap (EBIT-I) at the Lawrence\nLivermore National Laboratory. Only with a multi-ion model including all major\natomic collisional and radiative processes, are we able to identify the\nobserved K-shell transitions of oxygen ions from \\ion{O}{3} to \\ion{O}{6}. The\nwavelengths and associated errors for some of the strongest transitions are\ngiven, taking into account both the experimental and modeling uncertainties.\nThe present data should be useful in identifying the absorption features\npresent in astrophysical sources, such as active galactic nuclei and X-ray\nbinaries. They are also useful in providing benchmarks for the testing of\ntheoretical atomic structure calculations.\n", "  We present sub-arcsecond images of AB Auriga obtained with the IRAM Plateau\nde Bure interferometer in the isotopologues of CO, and in continuum at 3 and\n1.3 mm. Instead of being centrally peaked, the continuum emission is dominated\nby a bright, asymmetric (spiral-like) feature at about 140 AU from the central\nstar. The large scale molecular structure suggests the AB Aur disk is inclined\nbetween 23 and 43 degrees, but the strong asymmetry of the continuum and\nmolecular emission prevents an accurate determination of the inclination of the\ninner parts. We find significant non-Keplerian motion, with a best fit exponent\nfor the rotation velocity law of 0.41 +/- 0.01, but no evidence for radial\nmotions. The disk has an inner hole about 70 AU in radius. The disk is warm and\nshows no evidence of depletion of CO. The dust properties suggest the dust is\nless evolved than in typical T Tauri disks. Both the spiral-like feature and\nthe departure from purely Keplerian motions indicates the AB Aur disk is not in\nquasi-equilibrium. Disk self-gravity is insufficient to create the\nperturbation. This behavior may be related either to an early phase of star\nformation in which the Keplerian regime is not yet fully established and/or to\na disturbance of yet unknown origin. An alternate, but unproven, possibility is\nthat of a low mass companion located about 40 AU from AB Aur.\n", "  Circulation-dominated solar dynamo models, which employ a helioseismic\nrotation profile and a fixed meridional flow, give a good approximation to the\nlarge scale solar magnetic phenomena, such as the 11-year cycle or the so\ncalled Hale's law of polarities. Nevertheless, the larger amplitude of the\nradial shear at the high latitudes makes the dynamo to produce a strong\ntoroidal magnetic field at high latitudes, in contradiction with the\nobservations of the sunspots (Sporer`s Law). A possible solution was proposed\nby Nandy and Choudhur (2002) in which a deep meridional flow can conduct the\nmagnetic field inside of a stable layer (the radiative core) and then allow\nthat it erupts just at lower latitudes. We have recently explored this\nhypothesis in a different approximation, using the magnetic buoyancy mechanism\nproposed by Dikpaty and Charbonneau (1999) and found that a deep meridional\nflow pushes the maximum of the toroidal magnetic field towards the solar\nequator, but, in contrast to Nandy and Choudhuri (2002), a second zone of\nmaximum fields remains at the poles (Guerrero and Munoz (2004)). We here review\nthese results and also discuss a new possible scenario where the tachocline has\nan ellipsoidal shape, following early helioseismologic observations Charbonneau\net. al., (1999), and find that the modification of the geometry of the\ntachocline can lead to results which are in good agreement with observations\nand opens the possibility to explore in more detail, through the dynamo model,\nthe place where the magnetic field could be really stored.\n", "  ALHAMBRA is a project to gather data to sample a fraction of the Universe\nwith enough precision to follow the evolution of its content and properties\nwith z, a kind of Cosmic Tomography. It is defined as a 4 square degrees\nphotometric survey with 20 contiguous, equal width, medium band filters\ncovering from 3500 to 9700 A, plus the JHKs NIR bands. It was optimized to get\n(for a fixed observing time) the maximum number of objects with accurate\nclassification and redshift and to be sensitive to relatively faint emission\nfeatures. The observations will be carried out with the 3.5m telescope in Calar\nAlto (Spain). We intend to reach the limit AB=25 in all the optical filters\nfrom the bluest to 8300 A, and from 24.7 to 23.4 for the remainder. The\nexpected limit in the NIR is fixed at Ks=20, H=21, J=22. The homogeneous and\ncontiguous spectral coverage will result in several hundred thousand objects\nwith accurate SED identification and z-values. The accuracy of the survey will\nallow to make detailed studies, including galactic, without the need for any\nfurther follow-up. Indeed, it will provide exciting targets for large\ntelescopes, the GTC in particular.\n", "  We present a list of 130 Galactic Open Clusters, found in the All-Sky\nCompiled Catalogue of 2.5 Million Stars (ASCC-2.5). For these clusters we\ndetermined and publish a homogeneous set of astrophysical parameters such as\nsize, membership, motion, distance and age. In a previous work 520 already\nknown open clusters out of the sample of 1700 clusters from the literature were\nconfirmed in the ASCC-2.5 using independent, objective methods. Using these\nmethods the whole sky was systematically screened for the search of new\nclusters. The newly detected clusters show the same distribution over the sky\nas the known ones. It is found, that without the {\\em a-priori} knowledge about\nexisting clusters our search lead to clusters which are, {\\em on average},\nbrighter, have more members and cover larger angular radii than the 520\npreviously known ones.\n", "  We study the relationships between galaxy total luminosity (M_g), morphology,\ncolor and environment as a function of redshift. We use a magnitude-limited\nsample of 65,624 galaxies in the redshift range 0<z<1.3 taken from one of the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep Fields. We parametrize galaxy\nmorphology according to the Sersic index n. Our n>2 number fractions at z=0.1\nagree well with those based on SDSS galaxies. We find that the n>2 galaxy\nnumber fraction is constant with redshift in the field. However, for overdense\nenvironments this fraction is larger and increases towards lower redshifts,\nhigher densities and higher luminosities. Rest-frame color-magnitude diagrams\nshow that the color distribution is bimodal out to our redshift limit of z~1\nwith a prominent red-sequence of galaxies at 0.2<z<0.4 and a large blue-peak\ndominance at 0.8<z<1. We use this bimodality to define a red galaxy fraction\n(rest-frame u-g>1). For all environments, this fraction increases towards lower\nredshifts and higher luminosities. The red fraction within cluster-like regions\nchanges 60% faster with redshift as compared to the field for M_g<-19.5. Using,\nfor the first time, observations across many cluster-field interfaces\ndistributed over a single, large volume, we trace the large-scale\nmorphology-density relation and the Butcher-Oemler effect over a period of\nalmost 8 Gyr.\n", "  Three nearby star candidates were selected as bright 2MASS point sources\nwithout associated optical sources, i.e. with potentially large proper motions,\nsubsequently confirmed by multi-epoch optical data from the SuperCOSMOS Sky\nSurveys. All three objects are listed in the NLTT catalogue of high proper\nmotion stars. Follow-up spectroscopic observations allowed us to classify L\n449-1 as M4.0e dwarf at 5.7 pc, L43-72 as M4.5e dwarf at 7.2 pc, and LP 949-15\nas M5.0e dwarf at 6.1 pc, using known absolute $JHK_\\mathrm{s}$ magnitudes of\ndwarfs with corresponding spectral types, respectively. All three stars exhibit\n$H{\\alpha}$ emission lines, and all three can be identified with bright X-ray\nsources. The available ROSAT light curves of two of the objects show typical\nflare-like variability. Thus, all three stars are active, very close potential\nneighbours of the Sun, previously not mentioned as such, certainly deserving\nfurther attention. In particular, these are very promising candidates for\ntrigonometric parallax programs.\n", "  M 83 is one of the nearest galaxies with an enhanced nuclear star formation\nand it presents one of the best opportunities to study the kinematics and\nphysical properties of a circumnuclear starburst. Our three-dimensional\nspectroscopy data in R band confirm the presence of a secondary nucleus or mass\nconcentration (previously suggested by Thatte and coworkers). We determine the\nposition of this hidden nucleus, which would be more massive than the visible\none, and was not detected in the optical HST images due, probably, to the\nstrong dust extinction. The optical nucleus has a mass of 5 x 10^6 M_Sun / sin\ni (r < 1''.5), and the hidden nucleus, located 3''.9 +/- 0''.5 at the NW (PA\n271 +/- 15 deg) of the optical nucleus, would have a mass of 1 x 10^7 M_Sun /\nsin i (r < 1''.5). The emission line ratio map also unveils the presence of a\nsecond circumnuclear ring structure, previously discovered by IR imaging\n(Elmegreen and coworkers). The data allow us to resolve the behavior of the\ninterstellar medium inside the circumnuclear ring and around the binary mass\nconcentration.\n", "  HIP 7666 is a variable star newly discovered during the Hipparcos mission and\nclassified as of unknown type (ESA 1997). During 23 nights between July 2000\nand November 2000, over 2300 CCD observations in the V band were obtained from\nHostalets de Pierola and Monegrillo observatories in Spain. These data show\nthat the new variable is a detached eclipsing binary system with an orbital\nperiod of 2.37229 days. In addition, one of the components undergoes very\nshort-period oscillations with a main pulsation frequency of 24.46 or 25.47\nc/d. HIP 7666 is therefore a new member of the presently very few known\ndetached eclipsing binary systems with a Delta Scuti type component.\n", "  In this paper we study the supercluster - cluster morphological properties\nusing one of the largest ($2\\times 512^{3}$ SPH+N-body simulations of large\nscale structure formation in a $\\Lambda$CDM model, based on the publicly\navailable code GADGET. We find that filamentary (prolate-like) shapes are the\ndominant supercluster and cluster dark matter halo morphological feature, in\nagreement with previous studies. However, the baryonic gas component of the\nclusters is predominantly spherical. We investigate the alignment between\ncluster halos (using either their DM or baryonic components) and their parent\nsupercluster major-axis orientation, finding that clusters show such a\npreferential alignment. Combining the shape and the alignment statistics, we\nalso find that the amplitude of supercluster - cluster alignment increases\nalthough weakly with supercluster filamentariness.\n", "  A new method for the formal solution of the 2D radiative transfer equation in\naxial symmetry in the presence of arbitrary velocity fields is presented. The\ncombination of long and short characteristics methods is used to solve the\nradiative transfer equation. We include the velocity field in detail using the\nLocal Lorentz Transformation. This allows us to obtain a significantly better\ndescription of the photospheric region, where the gradient of the global\nvelocity is too small for the Sobolev approximation to be valid. Sample test\ncalculations for the case of a stellar wind and a rotating atmosphere are\npresented.\n", "  Cepheids play a key role in astronomy as standard candles for measuring\nintergalactic distances. Their distance is usually inferred from the\nPeriod-Luminosity relationship, calibrated using the semi-empirical\nBaade-Wesselink method. Using this method, the distance is known to a\nmultiplicative factor, called the projection factor. Presently, this factor is\ncomputed using numerical models - it has hitherto never been measured directly.\nBased on our new interferometric measurements obtained with the CHARA Array and\nthe already published parallax, we present a geometrical measurement of the\nprojection factor of a Cepheid, delta Cep. The value we determined, p =\n1.27$\\pm$0.06, confirms the generally adopted value of p = 1.36 within 1.5\nsigmas. Our value is in line with recent theoretical predictions of Nardetto et\nal. (2004).\n", "  We demonstrate that there are systematic scale errors in the [Fe/H] values\ndetermined by the Hamburg/ESO Survey (and by the HK Survey by inference) for\ncertain extremely metal poor (EMP) highly C-enhanced giants. The consequences\nof these scale errors are that a) the fraction of carbon stars at extremely low\nmetallicities has been substantially overestimated in several papers in the\nrecent literature b) the number of EMP stars known is somewhat lower than has\nbeen quoted in the recent literature c) the yield for EMP stars by the HK and\nthe HES Survey is somewhat lower than is stated in the recent literature. A\npreliminary estimate for the frequency of Carbon stars among the giants in the\nHES sample with -4 < [Fe/H] < -2.0 dex is 7.4 \\pm 2.9%, and for C-rich giants\nwith [C/Fe] > +1.0 dex is 14.4 \\pm 4%.\n  Here we present the key results of detailed abundance analyses of 14 C-stars\nselected from the HES as candidate EMP stars, of ~50 such stars analyzed. About\n80% of such C-stars show highly enhanced Ba as well, with C enhanced by a\nfactor of about 100, and [Ba/C] roughly Solar. These stars often show prominent\nlead lines, The remaining 20% of the C-stars do not show an enhancemement of\nthe s-process neutron capture elements around the Ba peak. They tend to be the\nmost metal-poor stars studied. We suggest that all these EMP C-stars are the\nremnants of the secondary in a mass transfer binary system where the former\nprimary was an AGB star, which transferred substantial mass at that\nevolutionary stage. (published abstract will be shorter due to space\nlimitations)\n", "  We have collected in 2004 adaptive optics corrected L' images of the Galactic\nCenter region with NAOS-CONICA at VLT. A strong variability was observed as\nwell as a correlation between the photocenter positions and fluxes of the\nL'-band counterpart of Sgr A*. It is interpreted as the combined emission of a\npoint-like flaring source at the position of Sgr A*/IR itself and an extended\ndust structure, 75 mas south west of Sgr A*/IR, which we name Sgr A*-f. We\nexamine the different possible mechanisms to explain this dual Sgr A* L'\nemission and conclude it is likely a flaring emission associated to energetic\nevents in the close environment of the black hole plus a quiescent emission\nresulting from the collision of Sgr A*-f by a jet from Sgr A*.\n", "  The VITRUV project has the objective to deliver milli-arcsecond\nspectro-images of the environment of compact sources like young stars, active\ngalaxies and evolved stars to the community. This instrument of the VLTI second\ngeneration based on the integrated optics technology is able to combine from 4\nto 8 beams from the VLT telescopes. Working primarily in the near infrared, it\nwill provide intermediate to high spectral resolutions and eventually\npolarization analysis. This paper summarizes the result from the concept study\nled within the Joint Research Activity advanced instruments of the OPTICON\nprogram.\n", "  The present letter is aimed at exploring the influence of overshooting during\nthe central helium burning in pre-white dwarf progenitors on the pulsational\nproperties of PG1159 stars. To this end we follow the complete evolution an\nintermediate-mass white dwarf progenitor from the zero age main sequence\nthrough the thermally pulsing and born-again phases to the domain of the PG1159\nstars. Our results suggest that the presence of mode-trapping features in the\nperiod spacings of these hot pulsating stars could result from structure in the\ncarbon-oxygen core. We find in particular that in order to get enough core\nstructure consistent with observational demands, the occurrence of overshoot\nepisodes during the central helium burning is needed. This conclusion is valid\nfor thick helium envelopes like those predicted by our detailed evolutionary\ncalculations. If the envelope thickness were substantially smaller, then the\noccurrence of core overshooting would be more difficult to disentangle from the\neffects related to the envelope transition zones.\n", "  We apply the thermodynamical model of the cosmological event horizon of the\nspatially flat FLRW metrics to the study of the recent accelerated expansion\nphase and to the coincidence problem. This model, called \"ehT model\" hereafter,\nled to a dark energy (DE) density $\\Lambda $ varying as $r^{-2},$ where $r$ is\nthe proper radius of the event horizon. Recently, another model motivated by\nthe holographic principle gave an independent justification of the same\nrelation between $\\Lambda $ and $r$. We probe the theoretical results of the\nehT model with respect to the SnIa observations and we compare it to the model\ndeduced from the holographic principle, which we call \"LHG model\" in the\nfollowing.Our results are in excellent agreement with the observations for\n$H\\_{0}=64kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$, and $\\Omega \\_{\\Lambda\n}^{0}=0.63\\_{-0.01}^{+0.1}$, which leads to $q\\_{0}=-0.445$ and $z\\_{T}\\simeq\n0.965$.\n", "  We study the formation and evolution of DA white dwarfs, the progenitors of\nwhich have experienced a late thermal pulse (LTP) shortly after the departure\nfrom the thermally pulsing AGB. To this end, we compute the complete evolution\nof an initially 2.7 Mo star all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the\nwhite dwarf stage. We find that most of the original H-rich material of the\npost-AGB remnant is burnt during the post-LTP evolution, with the result that,\nat entering its white dwarf cooling track, the remaining H envelope becomes\n10^-6 Mo in agreement with asteroseismological inferences for some ZZ Ceti\nstars.\n", "  We present detailed theoretical mass-radius relations for massive white dwarf\nstars with oxygen-neon cores. This work is motivated by recent observational\nevidence about the existence of white dwarf stars with very high surface\ngravities. Our results are based on evolutionary calculations that take into\naccount the chemical composition expected from the evolutionary history of\nmassive white dwarf progenitors. We present theoretical mass-radius relations\nfor stellar mass values ranging from 1.06 to 1.30 Mo with a step of 0.02 Mo and\neffective temperatures from 150000 K to approx. 5,000 K. A novel aspect\npredicted by our calculations is that the mass-radius relation for the most\nmassive white dwarfs exhibits a marked dependence on the neutrino luminosity.\nExtensive tabulations for massive white dwarfs, accessible from our web site,\nare presented as well.\n", "  VITRUV is a second generation spectro-imager for the PRIMA enabled Very Large\nTelescope Interferometer. By combining simultaneously up to 8 telescopes VITRUV\nmakes the VLTI up to 6 times more efficient. This operational gain allows two\nnovel scientific methodologies: 1) massive surveys of sizes; 2) routine\ninterferometric imaging. The science cases presented concentrate on the\nqualitatively new routine interferometric imaging methodology. The science\ncases are not exhaustive but complementary to the PRIMA reference mission. The\nfocus is on: a) the close environment of young stars probing for the initial\nconditions of planet formation and disk evolution; b) the surfaces of stars\ntackling dynamos, activity, pulsation, mass-loss and evolution; c) revealing\nthe origin of the extraordinary morphologies of Planetary Nebulae and related\nstars; d) studying the accretion-ejection structures of stellar black-holes\n(microquasars) in our galaxy; e) unveiling the different interacting components\n(torus, jets, BLRs) of Active Galactic Nuclei; and f) probing the environment\nof nearby supermassive black-holes and relativistic effects in the Galactic\nCenter black-hole.\n", "  We present optical and near-infrared finding charts taken from the DSS and\n2MASS surveys of 94 IRAS sources selected from the GLMP catalogue\n(Garc\\'{\\i}a-Lario 1992), and accurate astrometry (~0.2\") for most of them.\nSelection criteria were very red IRAS colours representative for OH/IR stars\nwith optically thick circumstellar shells and the presence of variability\naccording to the IRAS variability index (VAR>50). The main photometric\nproperties of the stars in this `GLMP sample' are presented, discussed and\ncompared with the correspondent properties of the `Arecibo sample' of OH/IR\nstars studied in Jim\\'enez-Esteban et al. (2005a). We find that 37% of the\nsample (N=34) have no counterpart in the 2MASS, implying extremely high optical\ndepths of their shells. Most of the sources identified in the 2MASS are faint\n(K>~8) and of very red colour in the near-infrared, as expected. The brightest\n2MASS counterpart (K=5.3mag) was found for IRAS 18299--1705. Its blue colour\nH--K=1.3 suggests that IRAS 8299--1705 is a post-AGB star. A couple of GLMP\nsources have faint but relatively blue counterparts. They might be misidentifed\nfield stars or stars hich experienced recently a drop of their mass loss rates.\nThe `GLMP sample' in general is made of oxygen-rich AGB stars, which are highly\nobscured by their circumstellar shells. They belong to the same population as\nthe reddest OH/IR stars in the `Arecibo sample'.\n", "  We present the results of a three dimensional, locally isothermal,\nnon-self-gravitating SPH code which models protoplanetary disks with two\nfluids: gas and dust. We ran simulations of a 1 Msun star surrounded by a 0.01\nMsun disk comprising 99% gas and 1% dust in mass and extending from 0.5 to ~300\nAU. The grain size ranges from 0.001 mm to 10 m for the low resolution (~25 000\nSPH particles) simulations and from 0.1 mm to 10 cm for the high resolution\n(~160 000 SPH particles) simulations. Dust grains are slowed down by the\nsub-Keplerian gas and lose angular momentum, forcing them to migrate towards\nthe central star and settle to the midplane. The gas drag efficiency varies\naccording to the grain size, with the larger bodies being weakly influenced and\nfollowing marginally perturbed Keplerian orbits, while smaller grains are\nstrongly coupled to the gas. For intermediate sized grains, the drag force\ndecouples the dust and gas, allowing the dust to preferentially migrate\nradially and efficiently settle to the midplane. The resulting dust\ndistributions for each grain size will indicate, when grain growth is added,\nthe regions when planets are likely to form.\n", "  We report on a multi-band survey for very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in\nthe Lupus 3 cloud with the Wide Field Imager (WFI) at the ESO/MPG 2.2m\ntelescope on La Silla Observatory (Chile). Our multiband optical photometry is\ncombined with available 2MASS JHK photometry to identify 19 new young stars and\n3 brown dwarf candidates as probable members of this star forming region. Our\nobjects are mostly clustered around the cloud core. Stars and brown dwarfs have\nsimilar levels of H-alpha emission, probably a signature of accretion. One\nobject, a brown dwarf candidate, exhibits a near-infrared excess, which may\nindicate the presence of a disk, but its H-alpha emission cannot be confirmed\ndue to its faintness in the optical passbands. We also find two visual pairs of\nprobable Lupus 3 members that may be wide binaries.\n", "  In this study optical/near-infrared(NIR) broad band photometry and optical\nspectroscopic observations of the GRB 030329 host galaxy are presented. The\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the host is consistent with a starburst\ngalaxy template with a dominant stellar population age of ~150 Myr and an\nextinction Av ~0.6. Analysis of the spectral emission lines shows that the host\nis likely a low metallicity galaxy. Two independent diagnostics, based on the\nrestframe UV continuum and the [OII] line flux, provide a consistent\nunextincted star formation rate of SFR ~0.6 Mo yr^-1. The low absolute\nmagnitude of the host (M_B ~ -16.5) implies a high specific star formation rate\nvalue, SSFR = ~34 Mo yr^-1 (L/L*)^-1.\n", "  The spherical infall model first developed by Lema\\^{i}tre and Tolman was\nmodified in order to include the effects of a dark energy term. The resulting\nvelocity-distance relation was evaluated numerically. This equation, when\nfitted to actual data, permits the simultaneous evaluation of the central mass\nand of the Hubble parameter. Application of this relation to the Local Group,\nwhen the dark energy is modeled by a cosmological constant, yields a total mass\nfor the M31-Milky Way pair of (2.5 +/- 0.7) x 10^12 M\\_sun, a Hubble parameter\nH\\_0 = 74 +/- 4 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 and a 1-D velocity dispersion for the flow of\nabout 39 km s^-1. The zero-velocity and the marginally bound surfaces of the\nLocal Group are at about 1.0 and 2.3 Mpc respectively from the center of mass.\nA similar analysis for the Virgo cluster yields a mass of (1.10 +/- 0.12) x\n10^15 M\\_sun and H\\_0 = 65 +/- 9 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. The zero-velocity is located\nat a distance of 8.6 +/- 0.8 Mpc from the center of the cluster. The predicted\npeculiar velocity of the Local Group towards Virgo is about 190 kms^-1, in\nagreement with other estimates. Slightly lower masses are derived if the dark\nenergy is represented by a fluid with an equation of state P = w\\epsilon with w\n= -2/3.\n", "  We report infrared observations of the planetary nebula Hen 2-113 obtained\nwith VLT/NACO, VLTI/MIDI, VLT/ISAAC and TIMMI at the ESO 3.6m. Hen 2-113\nexhibits a clear ring-like structure superimposed to a more diffuse environment\nvisible in the L' (3.8$\\mu$m), M' (4.78$\\mu$m) and 8.7$\\mu$m bands. No clear\ncore at 8.7$\\mu$m and no fringes through the N band could be detected for this\nobject with MIDI. A qualitative interpretation of the object structure is\nproposed using a diabolo-like geometrical model. The PAH content of the nebula\nwas also studied with ISAAC and TIMMI observations. This indicates that the\nPAHs are mostly concentrated towards the lobes of the diabolo and the bipolar\nlobes of the nebula. In L' band, a void $0.3\\arcsec$ in diameter was discovered\nwith NACO around the central source. The L' and M' fluxes from the central\nsource were derived from NACO data indicating an important infrared excess with\nrespect to the expected stellar emission based on stellar models and short\nwavelength data. The observed flux from this source in the L' and M' is about\n300 and 800 times respectively than those expected from a model including only\nthe central star. Moreover, the central object appears resolved in L' band with\nmeasured FWHM about 155 mas. This infrared excess can be explained by emission\nfrom a cocoon of hot dust (T$\\sim$1000K) with a total mass\n$\\sim10^{-9}$M$\\_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The `O-rich AGB sequence' is a sequence of colours describing the location of\nO-rich AGB stars in the IRAS two-colour diagram [12]--[25] vs [25]--[60]. We\npropose an evolutionary scenario for this sequence in which all stars,\nindependent of their progenitor mass, start the AGB phase in the blue part of\nthe `O-rich AGB sequence' and then evolve toward redder colors, although only\nthe more massive stars would reach the very end of the `O-rich AGB sequence'.\nThe sources located in the blue part of the sequence are mainly Mira variables,\nwhose mean period is increasing with the IRAS colours. Most of them will evolve\ninto O-rich Type II (and III) Planetary Nebulae. Part of the stars located in\nthe red part of the sequence will change their chemical composition from O-rich\nto C-rich during their evolution in the AGB phase, and might evolve into C-rich\nType II Planetary Nebulae. Hot bottom burning may prevent the conversion to\ncarbon stars of the rest of sources located in the red part of the sequence and\nthey will end up as N-rich Type I Planetary Nebulae.\n", "  For the nearby dwarf star alpha Cen B (K1 V), we present limb darkening\npredictions from a 3D hydro-dynamical radiative transfer model of its\natmosphere. We first compare the results of this model to a standard Kurucz's\natmosphere. Then we use both predictions to fit the new interferometric\nvisibility measurements of alpha Cen B obtained with the VINCI instrument of\nthe VLT Interferometer. Part of these new visibility measurements were obtained\nin the second lobe of the visibility function, that is sensitive to stellar\nlimb darkening. The best agreement is found for the 3D atmosphere limb\ndarkening model and a limb darkened angular diameter of theta\\_3D =\n6.000+-0.021 mas, corresponding to a linear radius of 0.863+-0:003Ro (assuming\npi = 747.1+-1.2 mas). Ournew linear radius is in good agreement with the\nasteroseismic value predicted by Thevenin et al. (2002). In view of future\nobservations of this star with the VLTI/AMBER instrument, we also present limb\ndarkening predictions in the J, H and K bands.\n", "  AMBER is the first near infrared focal instrument of the VLTI. It combines\nthree telescopes and produces spectrally resolved interferometric measures.\nThis paper discusses some preliminary results of the first scientific\nobservations of AMBER with three Unit Telescopes at medium (1500) and high\n(12000) spectral resolution. We derive a first set of constraints on the\nstructure of the circumstellar material around the Wolf Rayet Gamma2 Velorum\nand the LBV Eta Carinae.\n", "  We studied the morphology of galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field South using\nACS multi-wavelength data from the Great Observatories Origin Deep Survey and\n524 spectroscopic redshifts from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey completed with 2874\nphotometric redshift computed from COMBO-17 multi-color data. The rest-frame\nB-band makes it possible to discriminate two morphological types in an\nasymmetry-concentration diagram: bulge- and disk-dominated galaxies. The\nrest-frame color index $B-I$ is found to be very correlated with the\nmorphological classification: wholly bulge-dominated galaxies are redder than\ndisk-dominated galaxies. However color allowed us to distinguish a population\nof faint blue bulge-dominated galaxies ($B-I<0.9$), whose nature is still\nunclear. Using the rest-frame B-band classification from $z\\sim0.15$ up to\n$z\\sim1.1$, we quantified the evolution of the proportion of morphological\ntypes as a function of the redshift. Our large sample allowed us to compute\nluminosity functions per morphological type in rest-frame B-band. The\nbulge-dominated population is found to be composite: on the one hand the red\n($(B-I)\\_{AB}>0.9$), bright galaxies, which seem to increase in density toward\nlow redshifts. On the other hand the blue, compact, faint bulge-dominated\ngalaxies, strongly evolving with the redshift.\n", "  We present a spectrophotometric analysis of S Ori J053825.4-024241, a\ncandidate member close to the substellar boundary of the young (1-8 Myr),\nnearby (~360 pc) sigma Orionis star cluster. Our optical and near-infrared\nphotometry and low-resolution spectroscopy indicate that S Ori J053825.4-024241\nis a likely cluster member with a mass estimated from evolutionary models at\n0.06+0.07-0.02 Msol, which makes the object a probable brown dwarf. The radial\nvelocity of S Ori J053825.4-024241 is similar to the cluster systemic velocity.\nThis target, which we have classified as an M 6.0+-1.0 low-gravity object,\nshows excessemission in the near-infrared and anomalously strong photometric\nvariability for its type (from the blue to the J band), suggesting the presence\nof a surrounding disc. The optical spectroscopic observations show a continuum\nexcess at short wavelengths and a persistent and resolved Halpha emission\n(pseudo-equivalent width of ~-250 AA) in addition to the presence of other\nforbidden and permitted emission lines, which we interpret as indicating\naccretion from the disc and possibly mass loss. We conclude that despite the\nlow mass of S Ori J053825.4-024241, this object exhibits some of the properties\ntypical of active classical T Tauri stars.\n", "  We show in this paper that the changes of the solar diameter in response to\nvariations of large scale magnetic fields and turbulence are not homologous.\nFor the best current model, the variation at the photospheric level is over\n1000 times larger than the variation at a depth of 5 Mm, which is about the\nlevel at which f-mode solar oscillations determine diameter variations. This\nmodel is supported by observations that indicate larger diameter changes for\nhigh degree f-modes than for low degree f-modes, since energy of the former are\nconcentrated at shallower layers than the latter.\n", "  Deep $B$ and $R$ images of three Hickson Compact Groups, HCG 79, HCG 88 and\nHCG 95, were analyzed using a new wavelet technic to measure possible\nintra-group diffuse light present in these systems. The method used, OV\\_WAV,\nis a wavelet technic particularly suitable to detect low-surface brightness\nextended structures, down to a $S/N = 0.1$ per pixel, which corresponds to a\n5-$\\sigma$-detection level in wavelet space. The three groups studied are in\ndifferent evolutionary stages, as can be judged by their very different\nfractions of the total light contained in their intra-group halos: $46\\pm11$%\nfor HCG 79 and $11\\pm26$% for HCG 95, in the $B$ band, and HCG 88 had no\ncomponent detected down to a limiting surface brightness of $29.1 B mag\narcsec^{-2}$. For HCG 95 the intra-group light is red, similar to the mean\ncolors of the group galaxies themselves, suggesting that it is formed by an old\npopulation with no significant on-going star formation. For HCG 79, however,\nthe intra-group material has significantly bluer color than the mean color of\nthe group galaxies, suggesting that the diffuse light may, at least in part,\ncome from stripping of dwarf galaxies which dissolved into the group potential\nwell.\n", "  The optical afterglow spectrum of GRB050401 (at z=2.8992+/-0.0004) shows the\npresence of a DLA, with log(nHI)=22.6+/-0.3. This is the highest column density\never observed in a DLA, and is about five times larger than the strongest DLA\ndetected so far in any QSO spectrum. From the optical spectrum, we also find a\nvery large Zn column density, allowing us to infer an abundance of\n[Zn/H]=-1.0+/-0.4. These large columns are supported by the X-ray spectrum from\nSwift-XRT which shows a column density (in excess of Galactic) of\nlog(nH)=22.21^{+0.06}_{-0.08} assuming solar abundances (at z=2.9). The\ncomparison of this X-ray column density, which is dominated by absorption due\nto alpha-chain elements, and the HI column density derived from the Ly-alpha\nabsorption line, allows us to derive a metallicity for the absorbing matter of\n[alpha/H]=-0.4+/-0.3. The optical spectrum is reddened and can be well\nreproduced with a power-law with SMC extinction, where A_V=0.62+/-0.06. But the\ntotal optical extinction can also be constrained in a way which is independent\nof the shape of the extinction curve: from the optical-to-X-ray spectral energy\ndistribution we find, 0.5<~A_V<~4.5. However, even this upper limit,\nindependent of the shape of the extinction curve, is still well below the dust\ncolumn that is inferred from the X-ray column density, i.e.\nA_V=9.1^{+1.4}_{-1.5}. This discrepancy might be explained by a small dust\ncontent with high metallicity (low dust-to-metals ratio). `Grey' extinction\ncannot explain the discrepancy since we are comparing the metallicity to a\nmeasurement of the total extinction (without reference to the reddening).\nLittle dust with high metallicity may be produced by sublimation of dust grains\nor may naturally exist in systems younger than a few hundred Myr.\n", "  In this letter we discuss the flux and the behavior of the bright optical\nflare emission detected by the 25 cm TAROT robotic telescope during the prompt\nhigh-energy emission and the early afterglow. We combine our data with\nsimultaneous observations performed in X-rays and we analyze the broad-band\nspectrum. These observations lead us to emphasize the similarity of GRB 050904\nwith GRB 990123, a remarkable gamma-ray burst whose optical emission reached\n9th magnitude. While GRB 990123 was, until now, considered as a unique event,\nthis observation suggests the existence of a population of GRBs which have very\nlarge isotropic equivalent energies and extremely bright optical counterparts.\nThe luminosity of these GRBs is such that they are easily detectable through\nthe entire universe. Since we can detect them to very high redshift even with\nsmall aperture telescopes like TAROT, they will constitute powerful tools for\nthe exploration of the high-redshift Universe and might be used to probe the\nfirst generation of stars.\n", "  Compact binaries consisting of neutron stars / black holes on eccentric orbit\nundergo a perturbed Keplerian motion. The perturbations are either of\nrelativistic origin or are related to the spin, mass quadrupole and magnetic\ndipole moments of the binary components. The post-Newtonian motion of such\nsystems decouples into radial and angular parts. We present here for the first\ntime the radial motion of such a binary encoded in a generalized Kepler\nequation, with the inclusion of all above-mentioned contributions, up to linear\norder in the perturbations. Together with suitably introduced parametrizations,\nthe radial motion is solved completely.\n", "  The effects of rapid rotation and bi--stability upon the density contrast\nbetween the equatorial and polar directions of a B[e] supergiant are\ninvestigated. Based on a new slow solution for different high rotational\nradiation--driven winds and the fact that bi--stability allows a change in the\nline--force parameters ($\\alpha$, $k$, and $\\delta$), the equatorial densities\nare about $10^2$--$10^3$ times higher than the polar ones. These values are in\nqualitative agreement with the observations. This calculation also permits to\nobtain the aperture angle of the disk.\n", "  The 2-10 keV continuum of AGN is well represented by a single power law,\ngenerally attributed to a hot comptonizing medium, such as a corona above the\naccretion disk. At smaller energies the continuum displays an excess with\nrespect to the extrapolation of this power law, called the ``soft X-ray\nexcess\". Until now it was attributed, either to reflection of the hard X-ray\nsource by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional comptonizing\nmedium. An alternative solution proposed by Gierli\\'nski & Done (2004) is that\na single power law represents correctly both the soft and the hard X-ray\nemission, and the soft X-ray excess is an artefact due to the absorption of the\nprimary power law by a relativistic wind. We examine the advantages and\ndrawbacks of the reflection versus absorption models. We argue that in the\nabsorption hypothesis, the absorbing medium should be in total pressure\nequilibrium, to constrain the spectral distribution which otherwise would be\ntoo strongly variable in time and from one object to the other, as compared to\nobservations. We conclude that some X-ray spectra, in particular those with\nstrong soft X-ray excesses, can be modelled by absorption in the 0.3-10 keV\nrange. However, due to the lack of a complete grid of models and good data\nextending above 10 keV, we are not able to conclude presently that all objects\ncan be accommodated with such models. These absorption models imply either\nstrong relativistic outflowing winds with mass rates of the order of the\nEddington value (or even larger), or quasi-spherical inhomogeneous accretion\nflows. Only weak excesses can be modelled by reflection, unless the primary\ncontinuum is not directly seen. Finally, a reflection model absorbed by a\nmodest relativistic wind could be the best solution to the problem.\n", "  We present the spectrophotometric properties of a sample of 141 emission-line\ngalaxies at redshifts in the range $0.2<z<1.0$ with a peak around\n$z\\in[0.2,0.4]$. The analysis is based on medium resolution\n($R\\_{\\mathrm{s}}=500-600$), optical spectra obtained at VLT and Keck. The\ntargets are mostly {} \"Canada-France Redshift Survey\" emission-line galaxies,\nwith the addition of field galaxies randomly selected behind lensing clusters.\nWe complement this sample with galaxy spectra from the {} \"Gemini Deep Deep\nSurvey\" public data release. We have computed absolute magnitudes of the\ngalaxies and measured the line fluxes and equivalent widths of the main\nemission/absorption lines. The last two have been measured after careful\nsubtraction of the fitted stellar continuum using the \\texttt{platefit}\nsoftware originally developed for the SDSS and adapted to our data. We present\na careful comparison of this software with the results of manual measurements.\nThe pipeline has also been tested on lower resolution spectra, typical of the\n{} \"VIMOS/VLT Deep Survey\" ($R\\_{\\mathrm{s}}=250$), by resampling our medium\nresolution spectra. We show that we can successfully deblend the most important\nstrong emission lines. These data are primarily used to perform a spectral\nclassification of the galaxies in order to distinguish star-forming galaxies\nfrom AGNs. Among the initial sample of 141 emission-line galaxies, we find 7\nSeyfert 2 (narrow-line AGN), 115 star-forming galaxies and 16 {} \"candidate\"\nstar-forming galaxies. Scientific analysis of these data, in terms of chemical\nabundances, stellar populations, etc, will be presented in subsequent papers of\nthis serie.\n", "  We present the gas-phase oxygen abundance (O/H) for a sample of 131\nstar-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($0.2<z<1.0$). The sample\nselection, the spectroscopic observations (mainly with VLT/FORS) and associated\ndata reduction, the photometric properties, the emission-line measurements, and\nthe spectral classification are fully described in a companion paper (Paper I).\nWe use two methods to estimate the O/H abundance ratio: the {} \"standard\"\n$R\\_{\\mathrm{23}}$ method which is based on empirical calibrations, and the\nCL01 method which is based on grids of photo-ionization models and on the\nfitting of emission lines. For most galaxies, we have been able to solve the\nproblem of the metallicity degeneracy between the high- and low-metallicity\nbranches of the O/H vs. $R\\_{\\mathrm{23}}$ relationship using various secondary\nindicators. The luminosity -- metallicity ($L-Z$) relation has been derived in\nthe $B$- and $R$-bands, with metallicities derived with the two methods\n($R\\_{\\mathrm{23}}$ and CL01). In the analysis, we first consider our sample\nalone and then a larger one which includes other samples of\nintermediate-redshift galaxies drawn from the literature. The derived $L-Z$\nrelations at intermediate redshifts are very similar (same slope) to the $L-Z$\nrelation obtained for the local universe. Our sample alone only shows a small\nevolution of the $L-Z$ relation with redshift up to $z\\sim1.0$. We only find\nstatistical variations consistent with the uncertainty in the derived\nparameters. Including other samples of intermediate-redshift galaxies, we find\nhowever that galaxies at $z\\sim1$ appear to be metal-deficient by a factor of\n$\\sim3$ compared with galaxies in the local universe. For a given luminosity,\nthey contain on average about one third of the metals locked in local galaxies.\n", "  We present 7 mm and 3.5 cm wavelength continuum observations toward the\nHerbig AeBe star HD169142 performed with the Very Large Array (VLA) with an\nangular resolution of ~1\". We find that this object exhibits strong (~4.4 mJy),\nunresolved (~1\") 7 mm continuum emission, being one of the brightest isolated\nHerbig AeBe stars ever detected with the VLA at this wavelength. No emission is\ndetected at 3.5 cm continuum, with a 3 sigma upper limit of ~0.08 mJy. From\nthese values, we obtain a spectral index of ~2.5 in the 3.5 cm to 7 mm\nwavelength range, indicating that the observed flux density at 7mm is most\nlikely dominated by thermal dust emission coming from a circumstellar disc. We\nuse available photometric data from the literature to model the spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of this object from radio to near-ultraviolet frequencies.\nThe observed SED can be understood in terms of an irradiated accretion disc\nwith low mass accretion rate, 10^{-8} solar masses per year, surrounding a star\nwith an age of ~10 Myr. We infer that the mass of the disc is ~0.04 solar\nmasses, and is populated by dust grains that have grown to a maximum size of 1\nmm everywhere, consistent with the lack of silicate emission at 10 microns.\nThese features, as well as indications of settling in the wall at the dust\ndestruction radius, led us to speculate the disc of HD169142 is in an advanced\nstage of dust evolution, particularly in its inner regions.\n", "  We present results of a study on the evolution of the parameters\ncharacterizing the structure and dynamics of the relaxed elliptical-like\nobjects (ELOs) identified at z=0, z=1 and z=1.5 in a set of hydrodynamical,\nself-consistent simulations operating in the context of a concordance\ncosmological model. The values of the stellar mass, the stellar half-mass\nradius and the stellar mean-square velocity have been measured in each ELO and\nfound to populate, at any z, a flattened ellipsoid close to a plane (the\ndynamical plane, DP). Our simulations indicate that, at the intermediate zs\nconsidered, individual ELOs evolve, increasing the values of these parameters\nas a consequence of on-going mass assembly, but, nevertheless, their DP is\nroughly preserved within its scatter, in agreement with observations of the\nFundamental Plane of ellipticals at different zs. We briefly discuss how this\nlack of significant dynamical and structural evolution in ELO samples arises,\nin terms of the two different phases operating in the mass aggregation history\nof their dark matter halos. According with our simulations, most dissipation\ninvolved in ELO formation takes place at the early violent phase, causing the\nstellar mass, the stellar half-mass radius and the stellar mean-square velocity\nparameters to settle down to the DP, and, moreover, the transformation of most\nof the available gas into stars. In the subsequent slow phase, ELO stellar mass\ngrowth preferentially occurs through non-dissipative processes, so that the DP\nis preserved and the ELO star formation rate considerably decreases. These\nresults hint, for the first time, to a possible way of explaining, in the\ncontext of cosmological simulations, different apparently paradoxical\nobservational results on ellipticals.\n", "  We present the results of a deep optical survey in the Corona Australis and\nChamaeleon II star forming regions. Our optical photometry is combined with\navailable near- and mid-infrared photometry to identify very low-mass candidate\nmembers in these dark clouds. In our Chamaeleon II field, only one object\nexhibits clear H-alpha emission, but the discrepancy between its optical and\nnear-infrared colours suggests that it might be a foreground star. We also\nidentify two objects without H-alpha emission that could be planetary mass\nmembers of Chamaeleon II. In Corona Australis, we find ten stars and three\nbrown dwarf candidates in the Coronet cluster. Five of our new members are\nidentified with ISOCAM sources. Only two of them have a mid-infrared excess,\nindicating the presence of an accretion disk. On the other hand, one brown\ndwarf candidate has a faint close companion, seen only in our deepest I-band\nimage. For many of the candidates in both clouds, membership could not be\ninferred from their H-alpha emission or near-infrared colours; these objects\nneed spectroscopic confirmation of their status.\n", "  Supernovae are essential to understanding the chemical evolution of the\nUniverse. Type Ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational tool\ncurrently available for studying the expansion history of the Universe and the\nnature of dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study\nof their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently\navailable data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae are\nrather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are\npoorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose\nspectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with\nprecise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the\nCarnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing\nphotometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on\ntelescope/filter/detector systems that are well understood and well\ncharacterized. During a five-year program which began in September 2004, we\nexpect to obtain high-precision u'g'r'i'BVYJHKs light curves and optical\nspectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. In this paper we\nprovide a detailed description of the CSP survey observing and data reduction\nmethodology. In addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectra\nobtained for a few representative supernovae during the first observing\ncampaign.\n", "  The debate on the oxygen abundances of metal-poor stars has its origin in\ncontradictory results obtained using different abundance indicators. To achieve\na better understanding of the problem we have acquired high quality spectra\nwith the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at VLT, with a\nsignal-to-noise of the order of 100 in the near ultraviolet and 500 in the\noptical and near infrared wavelength range. Three different oxygen abundance\nindicators, OH ultraviolet lines around 310.0 nm, the [OI] line at 630.03 nm\nand the OI lines at 777.1-5 nm were observed in the spectra of 13 metal-poor\nsubgiants with -3.0<=[Fe/H]<=-1.5. Oxygen abundances were obtained from the\nanalysis of these indicators which was carried out assuming local thermodynamic\nequilibrium and plane-parallel model atmospheres. Abundances derived from OI\nwere corrected for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. Stellar\nparameters were computed using Teff-vs-color calibrations based on the infrared\nflux method and Balmer line profiles, Hipparcos parallaxes and FeII lines.\n[O/Fe] values derived from the forbidden line at 630.03 nm are consistent with\nan oxygen/iron ratio that varies linearly with [Fe/H] as\n[O/Fe]}=-0.09(+/-0.08)[Fe/H]+0.36(+/-0.15). Values based on the OI triplet are\non average 0.19+/-0.22 dex(s.d.) higher than the values based on the forbidden\nline while the agreement between OH ultraviolet lines and the forbidden line is\nmuch better with a mean difference of the order of -0.09+/-0.25 dex(s.d.). In\ngeneral, our results follow the same trend as previously published results with\nthe exception of the ones based on OH ultraviolet lines. In that case our\nresults lie below the values which gave rise to the oxygen abundance debate for\nmetal-poor stars.\n", "  A sample of metal-poor subgiants has been observed with the UVES spectrograph\nat the Very Large Telescope and abundances of Li and Be have been determined.\nTypical signal-to-noise per spectral bin values for the co-added spectra are of\nthe order of 500 for the Li I line (670.78 nm) and 100 for the Be II doublet\nlines (313.04 nm). The spectral analysis of the observations was carried out\nusing the Uppsala suite of codes and MARCS (1D-LTE) model atmospheres with\nstellar parameters from photometry, parallaxes, isochrones and Fe II lines.\nAbundance estimates of the light elements were corrected for departures from\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium in the line formation. Effective temperatures\nand Li abundances seem to be correlated and Be abundances correlate with [O/H].\nStandard models predict Li and Be abundances approximately one order of\nmagnitude lower than main-sequence values which is in general agreement with\nthe observations. On average, our observed depletions seem to be 0.1 dex\nsmaller and between 0.2 and 0.4 dex larger (depending on which reference is\ntaken) than those predicted for Li and Be, respectively. This is not surprising\nsince the initial Li abundance, as derived from main-sequence stars on the\nSpite plateau, may be systematically in error by 0.1 dex or more, and\nuncertainties in the spectrum normalisation and continuum drawing may affect\nour Be abundances systematically.\n", "  Cosmological N-body simulations were performed to study the evolution of the\nphase-space density Q = rho/sigma^3 of dark matter halos. No significant\ndifferences in the scale relations Q ~ sigma^(-2.1) or Q ~ M^(-0.82) are seen\nfor \"cold\" or \"warm\" dark matter models. The follow up of individual halos from\nz = 10 up to the present time indicate the existence of two main evolutionary\nphases: an early and fast one (10 > z > 6.5), in which Q decreases on the\naverage by a factor of 40 as a consequence of the randomization of bulk motions\nand a late and long one (6.5 > z > 0), in which Q decreases by a factor of 20\nbecause of mixing induced by merger events. The study of these halos has also\nevidenced that rapid and positive variations of the velocity dispersion,\ninduced by merger episods, are related to a fast decrease of the phase density\nQ.\n", "  We present polarization data for 32 mainly southern pulsars at 8.4 GHz. The\nobservations show that the polarization fraction is low in most pulsars at this\nfrequency except for the young, energetic pulsars which continue to show\npolarization fractions in excess of 60 per cent. All the pulsars in the sample\nshow evidence for conal emission with only one third also showing core\nemission. Many profiles are asymmetric, with either the leading or the trailing\npart of cone not detectable. Somewhat surprisingly, the asymmetric profiles\ntend to be more polarized than the symmetrical profiles. Little or no pulse\nnarrowing is seen between 1 and 8.4 GHz. The spectral behaviour of the\northogonal polarization modes and radius to frequency mapping can likely\naccount for much of the observational phenomenology. Highly polarized\ncomponents may orginate from higher in the magnetosphere than unpolarized\ncomponents.\n", "  (Abridged) Chandra and Hubble ACS observations of 11 early-type galaxies\nprobe the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) - globular cluster (GC) connection. We\nexplore the optical properties of 270 GCs with LMXBs and 6,488 GCs without\nLMXBs. More massive, redder, and more compact GCs are more likely to contain\nLMXBs. Unlike Galactic GCs, a large number of GCs with LMXBs have half-mass\nrelaxation times > 2.5 Gyr. We fit the dependence of the expected number of\nLMXBs per GC, \\lambda_t, on the GC mass M, color (g-z), and half-mass radius\nr_{h,cor}, and find that \\lambda_t \\propto M^{1.24\\pm0.08}\n10^{0.9^{+0.2}_{-0.1} (g-z)} r_{h,cor}^{-2.2^{+0.3}_{-0.4}}. Our fit rules out\nthat the number of LMXBs per GC is linearly proportional to GC mass and that\nmost GCs with high X-ray luminosities contain a single LMXB. The detailed\ndependence of \\lambda_t on GC properties appears essentially equivalent to a\ndependence on the encounter rate \\Gamma_h and the metallicity Z, \\lambda_t\n\\propto \\Gamma_h^{0.82\\pm0.05} Z^{0.39\\pm0.07}. Our analysis provides strong\nevidence that dynamical formation and metallicity play the primary roles in\ndetermining the presence of an LMXB in extragalactic GCs. The shallower than\nlinear dependence for our sample requires an explanation by theories of\ndynamical binary formation. The abundance dependence is consistent with a\nmetallicity-dependent variation in the number o neutron stars and black holes\nper unit mass GC, effects from irradiation induced winds or suppression of\nmagnetic braking in metal-poor stars.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of cooling helium atmosphere white dwarfs using\na full evolutionary code, specifically developed for following the effects of\nelement diffusion and gravitational settling on white dwarf cooling. The major\ndifference between this work and previous work is that we use more recent\nopacity data from the OPAL project. Since, in general, these opacities are\nhigher than those available ten years ago, at a given effective temperature,\nconvection zones go deeper than in models with older opacity data. Thus\nconvective dredge-up of observationally detectable carbon in helium atmosphere\nwhite dwarfs can occur for thicker helium layers than found by Pelletier et al\n(1986). We find that the range of observed C to He ratios in different DQ white\ndwarfs of similar effective temperature is well explained by a range of initial\nhelium layer mass between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2} M_{\\odot}$, in good agreement\nwith stellar evolution theory, assuming a typical white dwarf mass of $0.6\nM_{\\odot}$. We also predict that oxygen will be present in DQ white dwarf\natmospheres in detectable amounts if the helium layer mass is near the lower\nlimit compatible with stellar evolution theory. Determination of the oxygen\nabundance has the potential of providing information on the profile of oxygen\nin the core and hence on the important $^{12}$C$(\\alpha,\\gamma)^{16}$O reaction\nrate.\n", "  The low-luminosity active galactic nucleus of M81 has been monitored at\ncentimeter wavelengths since early 1993 as a by-product of radio programs to\nstudy the radio emission from Supernova 1993J. The extensive data sets reveal\nthat the nucleus experienced several radio outbursts during the monitoring\nperiod. At 2 and 3.6 cm, the main outburst occurred roughly in the beginning of\n1993 September and lasted for approximately three months; at longer\nwavelengths, the maximum flux density decreases, and the onset of the burst is\ndelayed. These characteristics qualitatively resemble the standard model for\nadiabatically expanding radio sources, although certain discrepancies between\nthe observations and the theoretical predictions suggest that the model is too\nsimplistic. In addition to the large-amplitude, prolonged variations, we also\ndetected milder changes in the flux density at 3.6 cm and possibly at 6 cm on\nshort (less than 1 day) timescales. We discuss a possible association between\nthe radio activity and an optical flare observed during the period that the\nnucleus was monitored at radio wavelengths.\n", "  A compound tunneling mechanism from one integrable region to another mediated\nby a delocalized state in an intermediate chaotic region of phase space was\nrecently introduced to explain peculiar features of tunneling in certain\ntwo-dimensional systems. This mechanism is known as chaos-assisted tunneling.\nWe study its consequences for the distribution of the level splittings and\nobtain a general analytical form for this distribution under the assumption\nthat chaos assisted tunneling is the only operative mechanism. %The validity of\nthis form can then in %principle be checked either numerically or even\nexperimentally. We have checked that the analytical form we obtain agrees with\nsplitting distributions calculated numerically for a model system in which\nchaos-assisted tunneling is known to be the dominant mechanism. The\ndistribution depends on two parameters: The first gives the scale of the\nsplittings and is related to the magnitude of the classically forbidden\nprocesses, the second gives a measure of the efficiency of possible barriers to\nclassical transport which may exist in the chaotic region. If these are weak,\nthis latter parameter is irrelevant; otherwise it sets an energy scale at which\nthe splitting distribution crosses over from one type of behavior to another.\nThe detailed form of the crossover is also obtained and found to be in good\nagreement with numerical results for models for chaos-assisted tunneling.\n", "  A universal phase diagram for weakly pinned low-T$_c$ type-II superconductors\nis revisited and extended with new proposals. The low-temperature ``Bragg\nglass'' phase is argued to transform first into a disordered, glassy phase upon\nheating. This glassy phase, a continuation of the high-field equilibrium vortex\nglass phase, then melts at higher temperatures into a liquid. This proposal\nprovides an explanation for the anomalies observed in the peak effect regime of\n2H-NbSe$_2$ and several other low-T$_c$ materials which is independent of the\nmicroscopic mechanisms of superconductivity in these systems.\n", "  Electron spin resonance data of Cu^{2+} ions in La_{14-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{24}O_{41}\ncrystals (x=9,11,12) reveal a very large width of the resonance line in the\nparamagnetic state. This signals an unusually strong anisotropy of ~10% of the\nisotropic Heisenberg superexchange in the Cu-O chains of this compound. The\nstrong anisotropy can be explained by the specific geometry of two symmetrical\n90 degree Cu-O-Cu bonds, which boosts the importance of orbital degrees of\nfreedom. Our data show the apparent limitations of the applicability of an\nisotropic Heisenberg model to the low dimensional cuprates.\n", "  A general expression for the Green's function of a system of $N$ particles\n(bosons/fermions) interacting by contact potentials, including impurities with\nDirac-delta type potentials is derived. In one dimension for $N>2$ bosons from\nour {\\it spectral determinant method} the numerically calculated energy levels\nagree very well with those obtained from the exact Bethe ansatz solutions while\nthey are an order of magnitude more accurate than those found by direct\ndiagonalization. For N=2 bosons the agreement is shown analytically. In the\ncase of N=2 interacting bosons and one impurity, the energy levels are\ncalculated numerically from the spectral determinant of the system. The\nspectral determinant method is applied to an interacting fermion system\nincluding an impurity to calculate the persistent current at the presence of\nmagnetic field.\n", "  We investigate spherical macroions in the strong Coulomb coupling regime\nwithin the primitive model in salt-free environment. We first show that the\nground state of an isolated colloid is naturally overcharged by simple\nelectrostatic arguments illustrated by the Gillespie rule. We furthermore\ndemonstrate that in the strong Coulomb coupling this mechanism leads to ionized\nstates and thus to long range attractions between like-charged spheres. We use\nmolecular dynamics simulations to study in detail the counterion distribution\nfor one and two highly charged colloids for the ground state as well as for\nfinite temperatures. We compare our results in terms of a simple version of a\nWigner crystal theory and find excellent qualitative and quantitative\nagreement.\n", "  We analyze the diffusion of a Brownian particle in a fluid under stationary\nflow. By using the scheme of non-equilibrium thermodynamics in phase space, we\nobtain the Fokker-Planck equation which is compared with others derived from\nkinetic theory and projector operator techniques. That equation exhibits\nviolation of the fluctuation dissipation-theorem. By implementing the\nhydrodynamic regime described by the first moments of the non-equilibrium\ndistribution, we find relaxation equations for the diffusion current and\npressure tensor, allowing us to arrive at a complete description of the system\nin the inertial and diffusion regimes. The simplicity and generality of the\nmethod we propose, makes it applicable to more complex situations, often\nencountered in problems of soft condensed matter, in which not only one but\nmore degrees of freedom are coupled to a non-equilibrium bath.\n", "  Quasicrystals are metal alloys whose noncrystallographic symmetry and lack of\nstructural periodicity challenge methods of experimental structure\ndetermination. Here we employ quantum-based total-energy calculations to\npredict the structure of a decagonal quasicrystal from first principles\nconsiderations. We employ Monte Carlo simulations, taking as input the\nknowledge that a decagonal phase occurs in Al-Ni-Co near a given composition,\nand using a few features of the experimental Patterson function. The resulting\nstructure obeys a nearly deterministic decoration of tiles on a hierarchy of\nlength scales related by powers of $\\tau$, the golden mean.\n", "  Behavior analogous to a second order phase transition is observed for the\nhomogeneous cooling state of a heavy impurity particle in a granular fluid. The\norder parameter $\\phi $ is the ratio of impurity mean square velocity to that\nof the fluid, with a conjugate field $h$ proportional to the mass ratio. A\nparameter $\\beta $, measuring the fluid cooling rate relative to the\nimpurity--fluid collision rate, is the analogue of the inverse temperature. For\n$\\beta <1$ the fluid is ``normal'' with $\\phi =0$ at $h=0$, as in the case of a\nsystem with elastic collisions. For $\\beta >1$ an ``ordered'' state with $\\phi\n\\neq 0$ occurs at $h=0$, representing an extreme breakdown of equipartition.\nCritical slowing and qualitative changes in the velocity distribution function\nfor the impurity particle near the transition are noted\n", "  A two-dimensional (2D) assembly of noninteracting, temperature-dependent,\ncomposite-boson Cooper pairs (CPs) in chemical and thermal equilibrium with\nunpaired fermions is examined in a binary boson-fermion statistical model as\nthe superconducting singularity temperature is approached from above. The model\nis derived from {\\it first principles} for the BCS model interfermion\ninteraction from three extrema of the system Helmholtz free energy (subject to\nconstant pairable-fermion number) with respect to: a) the pairable-fermion\ndistribution function; b) the number of excited (bosonic) CPs, i.e., with\nnonzero total momenta--usually ignored in BCS theory--and with the appropriate\n(linear, as opposed to quadratic) dispersion relation that arises from the\nFermi sea; and c) the number of CPs with zero total momenta. Compared with the\nBCS theory condensate, higher singularity temperatures for the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate are obtained in the binary boson-fermion mixture model which are in\nrough agreement with empirical critical temperatures for quasi-2D\nsuperconductors.\n", "  Following a cell-method due to van Kampen for the calculation of a\ncoarse-grained free energy functional for the van der Waals gas, we compute a\ncorresponding entropy functional from microscopic principles. This entropy\nfunctional is one of the building blocks of the recently developed GENERIC\nframework. This framework allows to obtain in a thermodynamically consistent\nway the continuum hydrodynamic equations for a fluid able to display\nliquid-vapor coexistence. Surface tension appears naturally and the resulting\nmodel describes interfaces as diffuse regions, much in the same spirit as the\ngradient theory for equilibrium situations. We suggest that using interfacial\nforces in the integral form obtained in the microscopic derivation instead of\nthird order derivatives of the density field might represent an advantage from\na computational point of view.\n", "  We simulate a two-dimensional, lattice based, protein-level statistical\nmechanical model for prion diseases (e.g., Mad Cow disease) with concommitant\nprion protein misfolding and aggregation. Our simulations lead us to the\nhypothesis that the observed broad incubation time distribution in\nepidemiological data reflect fluctuation dominated growth seeded by a few\nnanometer scale aggregates, while much narrower incubation time distributions\nfor innoculated lab animals arise from statistical self averaging. We model\n`species barriers' to prion infection and assess a related treatment protocol.\n", "  Electrostatic force microscopy at cryogenic temperatures was used to probe\nthe electrostatic interaction between a conductive atomic force microscopy tip\nand electronic charges trapped in an InAs quantum dot. Measurement of the\nself-oscillation frequency shift of the cantilever as a function of tip-sample\nbias voltage revealed discrete jumps at certain voltages when the tip was\npositioned above a quantum dot. These jumps are attributed to single-electron\nfilling of the electronic states of the quantum dot. The estimated resonant\nenergies of two s-states and four p-states are compared with the experimental\ndata obtained for an ensemble of quantum dots by the capacitance measurement\ntechnique.\n", "  We study the rheology of a granular material slowly driven in a confined\ngeometry. The motion is characterized by a steady sliding with a resistance\nforce increasing with the driving velocity and the surrounding relative\nhumidity. For lower driving velocities a transition to stick-slip motion\noccurs, exhibiting a blocking enhancement whith decreasing velocity. We propose\na model to explain this behavior pointing out the leading role of friction\nproperties between the grains and the container's boundary.\n", "  Cooper pair (CP) binding with both zero and nonzero center-of-mass momenta\n(CMM) is studied with a set of renormalized equations assuming a short-ranged\n(attractive) pairwise interfermion interaction. Expanding the associated\ndispersion relation in 2D in powers of the CMM, in weak-to-moderate coupling a\nterm {\\it linear} in the CMM dominates the pair excitation energy, while the\nquadratic behavior usually assumed in Bose-Einstein (BE)-condensation studies\nprevails for any coupling {\\it only} in the limit of zero Fermi velocity when\nthe Fermi sea disappears, i.e., in vacuum. In 3D this same behavior is observed\nnumerically. The linear term, moreover, exhibits CP breakup beyond a threshold\nCMM value which vanishes with coupling. This makes all the excited\n(nonzero-CMM) BE levels with preformed CPs collapse into a single ground level\nso that a BCS condensate (where only zero CMM CPs are usually allowed) appears\nin zero coupling to be a special case in either 2D or 3D of the BE condensate\nof linear-dispersion-relation CPs.\n", "  Magnetic properties of TaB$_{2}$ were studied by means of DC and AC\nsusceptibility measurements. It has been found that the compound becomes\nsuperconducting at T$_{c}$ = 9.5 K. From upper critical field measurements the\nsuperconducting parameters have been evaluated, which indicated that TaB$_{2}$\nis a hard type-II superconductor. Possible reasons why superconductivity has\nnot been discovered in previous studies are briefly discussed.\n", "  We have measured the transverse thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{xy}$ of twinned\nand untwinned YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ single crystals as a function of angle\n$\\theta$ between the magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO$_2$ planes and\nthe heat current direction, at different magnetic fields and temperatures. For\nboth crystals we observed a clear twofold variation in the field-angle\ndependence of $\\kappa_{xy}(\\theta) = - \\kappa^0_{xy}(T,B) \\sin(2\\theta)$. We\nhave found that the oscillation amplitude $\\kappa^0_{xy}$ depends on\ntemperature and magnetic field. Our results show that $\\kappa^0_{xy} = a B\n\\ln(1/(bB))$ with the temperature- and sample-dependent parameters $a$ and $b$.\nWe discuss our results in terms of Andreev scattering of quasiparticles by\nvortices and a recently proposed theory based on the Doppler shift in the\nquasiparticle spectrum.\n", "  Macroscopic quantum coherence of Bose gas in a double-well potential is\nstudied based on SU(2)-coherent-state path-integral. The ground state and\nfluctuations around it can be obtained by this method. In this picture, one can\nobtain macroscopic quantum superposition states for attractive Bose gas. The\ncoherent gap of degenerate ground states is obtained with the instanton\ntechnique. The phenomenon of macroscopic quantum self-trapping is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  This paper focuses on mechanical aspects of chromatin biological functioning.\nWithin a basic geometric modeling of the chromatin assembly, we give for the\nfirst time the complete set of elastic constants (twist and bend persistence\nlengths, stretch modulus and twist-stretch coupling constant) of the so-called\n30-nm chromatin fiber, in terms of DNA elastic properties and geometric\nproperties of the fiber assembly. The computation naturally embeds the fiber\nwithin a current analytical model known as the ``extensible worm-like rope'',\nallowing a straightforward prediction of the force-extension curves. We show\nthat these elastic constants are strongly sensitive to the linker length, up to\n1 bp, or equivalently to its twist, and might locally reach very low values,\nyielding a highly flexible and extensible domain in the fiber. In particular,\nthe twist-stretch coupling constant, reflecting the chirality of the chromatin\nfiber, exhibits steep variations and sign changes when the linker length is\nvaried.\n  We argue that this tunable elasticity might be a key feature for chromatin\nfunction, for instance in the initiation and regulation of transcription.\n", "  Here we give further evidences to support our scaling relation described in\nour previous paper [cond-mat/0006459, Phys. Rev. Lett. Vol.85, pp.1238 (2000)].\n", "  We have calculated the low-field magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$ of a system\nconsisting of non-interacting mono-dispersed nanoparticles using a classical\nstatistical approach. The model makes use of the assumption that the axes of\nsymmetry of all nanoparticles are aligned and oriented at a certain angle\n$\\psi$ with respect to the external magnetic field. An analytical expression\nfor the temperature dependence of the susceptibility $\\chi(T)$ above the\nblocking temperature is obtained. The derived expression is a generalization of\nthe Curie law for the case of anisotropic magnetic particles. We show that the\nnormalized susceptibility is a universal function of the ratio of the\ntemperature over the anisotropy constant for each angle $\\psi$. In the case\nthat the easy-axis is perpendicular to the magnetic field the susceptibility\nhas a maximum. The temperature of the maximum allows one to determine the\nanisotropy energy.\n", "  An extensive first-principles study of fully exo-hydrogenated zigzag (n,0)\nand armchair (n,n) single wall carbon nanotubes (C$_n$H$_n$), polyhedral\nmolecules including cubane, dodecahedrane, and C$_{60}$H$_{60}$ points to\ncrucial differences in the electronic and atomic structures relevant to\nhydrogen storage and device applications. C$_n$H$_n$'s are estimated to be\nstable up to the radius of a (8,8) nanotube, with binding energies proportional\nto 1/R. Attaching a single hydrogen to any nanotube is always exothermic.\nHydrogenation of zigzag nanotubes is found to be more likely than armchair\nnanotubes with similar radius. Our findings may have important implications for\nselective functionalization and finding a way of separating similar radius\nnanotubes from each other.\n", "  The Coulomb drag between two spatially separated, 2 \\mu m long\nlithographically defined quantum wires has been studied experimentally in the\nabsence of interwire tunneling. The drag resistance R_D shows peaks when the 1D\nsubband bottoms of the wires are aligned and the Fermi wave vector k_F is\nsmall. R_D decreases exponentially with the interwire separation d. In the\ntemperature range 0.2K to 1K the drag signal shows the {\\it power-law\ndependence} R_D ~ T**x with x ranging from -0.61 to -0.77 depending on the\nmagnitude of k_F. We interpret our experimental results in the framework of the\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory.\n", "  Based on experimental evidences we present a phenomenological description of\nthe thermal glass transition as a dynamical phase transition. Different\nsusceptibilities calculated on the basis of this description are in good\nqualitative agreement with experimental data. As an essential feature this\nnovel view of the glass transition reflects the kinetic as well as the\ntransition aspect of the thermal glass transition.\n", "  The instability introduced in a large scale-free network by the triggering of\nnode-breaking avalanches is analyzed using the fiber-bundle model as conceptual\nframework. We found, by measuring the size of the giant component, the\navalanche size distribution and other quantities, the existence of an abrupt\ntransition. This test of strength for complex networks like Internet is more\nstringent than others recently considered like the random removal of nodes,\nanalyzed within the framework of percolation theory. Finally, we discuss the\npossible implications of our results and their relevance in forecasting\ncascading failures in scale-free networks.\n", "  We study the effects of the magnetic field on the relaxation of the\nmagnetization of small monodomain non-interacting particles with random\norientations and distribution of anisotropy constants. Starting from a master\nequation, we build up an expression for the time dependence of the\nmagnetization which takes into account thermal activation only over barriers\nseparating energy minima, which, in our model, can be computed exactly from\nanalytical expressions. Numerical calculations of the relaxation curves for\ndifferent distribution widths, and under different magnetic fields H and\ntemperatures T, have been performed. We show how a $\\svar$ scaling of the\ncurves, at different T and for a given H, can be carried out after proper\nnormalization of the data to the equilibrium magnetization. The resulting\nmaster curves are shown to be closely related to what we call effective energy\nbarrier distributions, which, in our model, can be computed exactly from\nanalytical expressions. The concept of effective distribution serves us as a\nbasis for finding a scaling variable to scale relaxation curves at different H\nand a given T, thus showing that the field dependence of energy barriers can be\nalso extracted from relaxation measurements.\n", "  We have measured the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient of a MgB2\nsintered sample. The temperature dependence of resistivity is fitted well by a\ngeneralized Bloch-Gruneisen equation with a Debye temperature of 1050 K. The\nSeebeck coefficient is given by the sum of a diffusive and a phonon drag term\nand the behavior in the temperature region $% Tc<T<0.1\\Theta_{R}$ follows a\nrelationship $AT+BT^{3}$ where the two terms are proportional to the electron\nand to the phonon specific heat, respectively. The phonon drag term, here\nemphasized for the first time, is rather large, indicating a strong\nelectron-phonon interaction. The diffusive term is positive and increases with\nAl doping. The comparison of the experimental values with calculations\nincluding precise electronic structure suggests that $\\sigma $ bands give the\nmain contribution to the Seebeck effect.\n", "  We suggest an approach to account for spatial (composition) and thermal\nfluctuations in \"disordered\" magnetic models (e.g. Heisenberg, Ising) with\ngiven spatial dependence of magnetic spin-spin interaction. Our approach is\nbased on introduction of fluctuating molecular field (rather than mean field)\nacting between the spins. The distribution function of the above field is\nderived self-consistently. In general case this function is not Gaussian,\nlatter asymptotics occurs only at sufficiently large spins (magnetic ions)\nconcentrations $n_i$. Our approach permits to derive the equation for a\ncritical temperature $T_c$ of ferromagnetic phase transition with respect to\nthe above fluctuations. We apply our theory to the analysis of influence of\ncomposition fluctuations on $T_c$ in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS) with\nRKKY indirect spin-spin interaction.\n", "  A strongly correlated electron system associated with the quantum\nsuperalgebra ${U}_q[{osp}(2|2)]$ is studied in the framework of the quantum\ninverse scattering method. By solving the graded reflection equation, two\nclasses of boundary-reflection $K$-matrices leading to four kinds of possible\nboundary interaction terms are found. Performing the algebraic Bethe ansatz, we\ndiagonalize the two-level transfer matrices which characterize the charge and\nthe spin degrees of freedom, respectively. The Bethe-ansatz equations, the\neigenvalues of the transfer matrices and the energy spectrum are presented\nexplicitly. We also construct two impurities coupled to the boundaries. In the\nthermodynamic limit, the ground state properties and impurity effects are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We make the first report that a metallic pyrochlore oxide \\Cd2Re2O7, exhibits\ntype II superconductivity at 1.1 K. The pyrochlore oxide is known to be a\ngeometrical frustrated system, which includes the tetrahedral network of\nmagnetic ions. A large number of compounds are classified in the family of\npyrochlore oxides, and these compounds exhibit a wide variety of physical\nproperties ranging from insulator through semiconductor and from bad metal to\ngood metal. Until now, however, no superconductivity has been reported for\nfrustrated pyrochlore oxides. The bulk superconductivity of this compound is\nconfirmed by measurements of the resistivity and the a. c. magnetic\nsusceptibility. The \\Hc2, which is extrapolated to 0 K, is estimated as about\n0.8 T, using the resistivity measurements under aplied field. The plot of \\Hc2\nvs $T$ indicates that the Cooper pairs are composed of rather heavy\nquasiparticles. This fact suggests that frustrated heavy electrons become\nsuperconducting in this compound.\n", "  We report Luttinger liquid line shapes better revealed by new angle resolved\nphotoemission data taken with a much improved angle resolution on a\nquasi-1-dimensional metal Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_6$O$_{17}$. The new data indicate a\nlarger spinon velocity than our previous lower resolution data indicated.\n", "  Paper withdrawn by authors. See new version in this same listing.\n", "  We study the resistivity vs. electric field dependence $\\rho(E)$ of a 2D hole\nsystem in SiGe close to the B=0 metal-insulator transition. Using $\\rho$ as a\n``thermometer'' to obtain the effective temperature of the holes $T_e(E)$, we\nfind that the $\\rho(E)$ dependence can be attributed to hole heating. The\nhole-phonon coupling involves weakly screened piezoelectric and deformation\npotentials compatible with previous measurements. The damping of the\nShubnikov-de Haas oscillations gives the same $T_e$ values. Thus the $\\rho(E)$\ndependence and the $E$-field ``scaling'' do not provide additional evidence for\na quantum phase transition (QPT). We discuss how to study, in general, true\n$E$-field scaling and extract the ratio of the QPT characteristic lengths.\n", "  The far-infrared absorption of triangular and square two-dimensional quantum\ndots is studied by means of time simulations of the density oscillations within\nthe time-dependent local-spin-density approximation. The absorption is\nspatially analyzed using a local-response theory that allows the identification\nof {\\em corner} and {\\em side} modes in the geometric nanostructures. The\nevolution with a vertical magnetic field of varying intensity is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Constitutive equations are proposed for dense materials, based on the\nidentification of two types of free-volume activated rearrangements associated\nto shear and compaction. Two situations are studied: the case of an amorphous\nsolid in a stress-strain test, and the case of a lubricant in tribology test.\nVarying parameters, strain softening, shear thinning, and stick-slip motion can\nbe observed.\n", "  The role that translational-rotational degrees of freedom play in nucleation\ntheories is reconsidered by the introduction of a new formalism that properly\naccounts for the effects of motion of clusters in nucleation rate. The analysis\nof the non-equilibrium kinetics of the process, performed by retaining the\ndynamics of the clusters, enables one to clarify some of the paradoxical\naspects that the inclusion of these degrees of freedom has presented.\n", "  The effective Coulomb interaction between globular proteins is calculated as\na function of monovalent salt concentration $c_s$, by explicit Molecular\nDynamics simulations of pairs of model proteins in the presence of microscopic\nco and counterions. For discrete charge patterns of monovalent sites on the\nsurface, the resulting osmotic virial coefficient $B_2$ is found to be a\nstrikingly non-monotonic function of $c_s$. The non-monotonicity follows from a\nsubtle Coulomb correlation effect which is completely missed by conventional\nnon-linear Poisson-Boltzmann theory and explains various experimental findings.\n", "  A two-dimensional (2D) assembly of noninteracting, temperature-dependent,\npre-formed Cooper pairs in chemical/thermal equilibrium with unpaired fermions\nis examined in a binary boson-fermion statistical model as the Bose-Einstein\ncondensation (BEC) singularity temperature $T_{c}$ is approached from above.\nCompared with BCS theory (which is {\\it not} a BEC theory) substantially higher\n$T_{c}$'s are obtained without any adjustable parameters, that fall roughly\nwithin the range of empirical $T_{c}$'s for quasi-2D cuprate superconductors.\n", "  We use the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory to derive the\ngeneral kinetic equation of a system in the presence of potential barriers. The\nresult is applied to the description of the evolution of systems whose dynamics\nis influenced by entropic barriers. We analyze in detail the case of diffusion\nin a domain of irregular geometry in which the presence of the boundaries\ninduces an entropy barrier when approaching the exact dynamics by a coarsening\nof the description. The corresponding kinetic equation, named Fick-Jacobs\nequation, is obtained, and its validity is generalized through the formulation\nof a scaling law for the diffusion coefficient which depends on the shape of\nthe boundaries. The method we propose can be useful to analyze the dynamics of\nsystems at the nanoscale where the presence of entropy barriers is a common\nfeature.\n", "  We present a theory for the laboratory and epidemiological data for\nincubation times in infectious prion diseases. The central feature of our model\nis that slow growth of misfolded protein-aggregates from small initial seeds\ncontrols the `latent' or `lag' phase, whereas aggregate-fissioning and\nsubsequent spreading leads to an exponential growth or doubling phase. Such a\ngeneral framework can account for many features of prion diseases including the\nstriking reproducibility of incubation times when high doses are inoculated\ninto lab animals. Broad incubation time distributions arise for low infectious\ndose, while our calculated distributions narrow to sharply defined onset times\nwith increased dose. We apply our distributions to epidemiological vCJD data\nand extract estimates of incubation times.\n", "  (63)Cu-NMR measurements have been performed on two-leg hole-doped spin\nladders Sr_{14-x}Ca_{x}Cu_{24}O_{41} single crystals (0-x-12) at several\npressures up to the pressure domain where the stabilization of a\nsuperconducting ground state can be achieved. The data reveal marked decrease\nof the spin gap derived from Knight shift measurements upon Ca substitution and\nalso under pressure and confirm the onset of low lying spin excitations around\nP_{c} as previously reported. The spin gap in Sr_{2}Ca_{12}Cu_{24}O_{41} is\nstrongly reduced above 20 kbar. However, the data of an experiment performed at\nP=36 kbar where superconductivity has been detected at 6.7K by an inductive\ntechnique have shown that a significant amount of spin excitations remains\ngapped at 80K when superconductivity sets in. The standard relaxation model\nwith two and three-magnon modes explains fairly well the activated relaxation\ndata in the intermediate temperature regime corresponding to gapped spin\nexcitations using the spin gap data derived from Knight shift experiments.The\ndata of Gaussian relaxation rates of heavily doped samples support the\nlimitation of the coherence lenght at low temperature by the average distance\nbetween doped holes. We discuss the interplay between superconductivity and the\nspin gap and suggest that these new results support the exciting prospect of\nsuperconductivity induced by the interladder tunnelling of preformed pairs as\nlong as the pressure remains lower than the pressure corresponding to the\nmaximum of the superconducting critical temperature.\n", "  We compute the number level variance $\\Sigma_{2}$ and the level\ncompressibility $\\chi$ from high precision data for the Anderson model of\nlocalization and show that they can be used in order to estimate the critical\nproperties at the metal-insulator transition by means of finite-size scaling.\nWith $N$, $W$, and $L$ denoting, respectively, system size, disorder strength,\nand the average number of levels in units of the mean level spacing, we find\nthat both $\\chi(N,W)$ and the integrated $\\Sigma_{2}$ obey finite-size scaling.\nThe high precision data was obtained for an anisotropic three-dimensional\nAnderson model with disorder given by a box distribution of width $W/2$. We\ncompute the critical exponent as $\\nu \\approx 1.45 \\pm 0.12$ and the critical\ndisorder as $W_{\\rm c} \\approx 8.59 \\pm 0.05$ in agreement with previous\ntransfer-matrix studies in the anisotropic model. Furthermore, we find\n$\\chi\\approx 0.28 \\pm 0.06$ at the metal-insulator transition in very close\nagreement with previous results.\n", "  We use the momentum space renormalization group to study the influence of\nphonons and the Coulomb interaction on the superconducting response function of\narmchair single-walled nanotubes. We do not find superconductivity in undoped\nsingle nanotubes. When doped, superconducting fluctuations can develop because\nof the phonons but remain small and are easily destroyed by the Coulomb\ninteraction. The origin of superconductivity in ropes of nanotobes is most\nlikely an intertube effect. Projections to zig-zag nanotubes indicate a more\nfavorable disposition to superconducting fluctuations.\n", "  We studied the crystal and magnetic structure of the\nLa$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ compound for $x=0.8$ and $x=0.85$. At T=300 K both\nsamples are paramagnetic with crystallographic symmetry $Pnma$. At low\ntemperatures they undergo a monoclinic distortion from orthorhombic $Pnma$-type\nstructure with $a_p\\sqrt{2}\\times 2a_p\\times a_p\\sqrt{2}$ to a monoclinic\nstructure with ($a_p\\sqrt{2}\\times 2a_p\\times a_p\\sqrt{2}$,\n$\\beta=90+\\epsilon\\sim 91.4^{\\rm o}$) and $P2_1/m$ space group below $T_N$. The\nonset of the structural transformation coincides with the development of the\n$C$-type long range antiferromagnetic order with propagation vector ${\\bf\nk}=({1/2},0,{1/2})$. The monoclinic unit cell allowed us to determine the\ndirection of the Mn magnetic moment with respect to the crystallographic axes:\nit is perpendicular to the propagation vector, ${\\bf m}\\perp {\\bf\nk}=({1/2},0,{1/2})$. The amplitude of the ordered magnetic moment at $T=1.6$ K\nis found to be $2.53(2)$ and $2.47(2)\\mu_{B}$ for $x=0.8$ and 0.85,\nrespectively.\n", "  Persistence is considered in diffusion--limited cluster--cluster aggregation,\nin one dimension and when the diffusion coefficient of a cluster depends on its\nsize $s$ as $D(s) \\sim s^\\gamma$. The empty and filled site persistences are\ndefined as the probabilities, that a site has been either empty or covered by a\ncluster all the time whereas the cluster persistence gives the probability of a\ncluster to remain intact. The filled site one is nonuniversal. The empty site\nand cluster persistences are found to be universal, as supported by analytical\narguments and simulations. The empty site case decays algebraically with the\nexponent $\\theta_E = 2/(2 - \\gamma)$. The cluster persistence is related to the\nsmall $s$ behavior of the cluster size distribution and behaves also\nalgebraically for $0 \\le \\gamma < 2$ while for $\\gamma < 0$ the behavior is\nstretched exponential. In the scaling limit $t \\to \\infty$ and $K(t) \\to\n\\infty$ with $t/K(t)$ fixed the distribution of intervals of size $k$ between\npersistent regions scales as $n(k;t) = K^{-2} f(k/K)$, where $K(t) \\sim\nt^\\theta$ is the average interval size and $f(y) = e^{-y}$. For finite $t$ the\nscaling is poor for $k \\ll t^z$, due to the insufficient separation of the two\nlength scales: the distances between clusters, $t^z$, and that between\npersistent regions, $t^\\theta$. For the size distribution of persistent regions\nthe time and size dependences separate, the latter being independent of the\ndiffusion exponent $\\gamma$ but depending on the initial cluster size\ndistribution.\n", "  The ferromagnetic and insulating state observed in La$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_3$,\n0.125$<$x$<$0.2, is characterized by structural and magnetic anomalies below\nT$_C$, similar to those observed in the x$_{Sr}$$\\approx$1/8. A neutron\nscattering study of the superlattice {\\bf Q$_0$}= (0,0,1+/4)$_{cub}$ peak, and\nof the magnetic excitations are reported in the x$_{Ca}$=0.2 sample. The\noccurrence of this superstructure is associated with the observation of a gap\nin the spin dynamics, at a {\\bf q$_0$} wave-vector ({\\bf q$_0$}={\\bf\nQ$_0$}-$\\tau$) with the same modulus $|${\\bf q$_0$}$|$ in all directions, which\ndivides the dispersion into two regimes. For $|${\\bf q}$|$$<$$|${\\bf q$_0$}$|$\nthe dispersion is splitted into two or three curves. For $|${\\bf\nq}$|$$>$$|${\\bf q$_0$}$|$, magnetic excitations lock on acoustic and optic\nphonon energies, revealing a new kind of magneto-vibrational coupling.\n  We suggest an analysis in terms of two distinct magnetic couplings,\nassociated with two ferromagnetic media involved into a collective state.\n", "  Critical state problems which incorporate more than one component for the\nmagnetization vector of hard superconductors are investigated. The theory is\nbased on the minimization of a cost functional ${\\cal C}[\\vec{H}(\\vec{x})]$\nwhich weighs the changes of the magnetic field vector within the sample. We\nshow that Bean's simplest prescription of choosing the correct sign for the\ncritical current density $J_c$ in one dimensional problems is just a particular\ncase of finding the components of the vector $\\vec{J}_c$. $\\vec{J}_c$ is\ndetermined by minimizing ${\\cal C}$ under the constraint $\\vec{J}\\in\\Delta\n(\\vec{H},\\vec{x})$, with $\\Delta$ a bounded set. Upon the selection of\ndifferent sets $\\Delta$ we discuss existing crossed field measurements and\npredict new observable features. It is shown that a complex behavior in the\nmagnetization curves may be controlled by a single external parameter, i.e.:\nthe maximum value of the applied magnetic field $H_m$.\n", "  We elucidate how the presence of noise may significantly interact with the\nsynchronization mechanism of systems exhibiting frequency-locking. The response\nof these systems exhibits a rich variety of behaviors, such as resonances and\nanti-resonances which can be controlled by the intensity of noise. The\ntransition between different locked regimes provokes the development of a\nmultiple enhancement of the effective diffusion. This diffusion behavior is\naccompanied by a crest-like peak-splitting cascade when the distribution of the\nlockings is self-similar, as it occurs in periodic systems that are able to\nexhibit a Devil's staircase sequence of frequency-lockings.\n", "  Recent experiments on mesoscopic samples and theoretical considerations lead\nus to analyze multiply charged ($n>1$) vortex solutions of the Ginzburg-Landau\nequations for arbitrary values of the Landau-Ginzburg parameter $\\kappa$. For\n$n\\gg 1$, they have a simple structure and a free energy ${\\cal F}\\sim n$.\n  In order to relate this behaviour to the classic Abrikosov result ${\\cal\nF}\\sim n^2$ when $\\kappa\\to +\\infty$, we consider the limit where both $n\\gg 1$\nand $\\kappa\\gg1$, and obtain a scaling function of the variable $\\kappa/n$ that\ndescribes the cross-over between these two behaviours of ${\\cal F}$. It is then\nshown that a small-n expansion can also be performed and the first two terms of\nthis expansion are calculated. Finally, large and small n expansions are given\nfor recently computed phenomenological exponents characterizing the free energy\ngrowth with $\\kappa$ of a giant vortex.\n", "  We have produced a macroscopic quantum system in which a Li-6 Fermi sea\ncoexists with a large and stable Na-23 Bose-Einstein condensate. This was\naccomplished using inter-species sympathetic cooling of fermionic Li-6 in a\nthermal bath of bosonic Na-23.\n", "  We generalize the Shastry-Sutherland model to three dimensions. By\nrepresenting the model as a sum of the semidefinite positive projection\noperators, we exactly prove that the model has exact dimer ground state.\nSeveral schemes for constructing the three-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland model\nare proposed.\n", "  We perform a systematic investigation of an asymmetric zig-zag spin ladder\nwith inter-leg exchange $J_1$ and different exchange integrals $J_2 \\pm \\delta$\non both legs. In the weak limit of frustration, the spin model can be mapped to\na revised double frequency Sine-Gorden model by using bosonization.\nRenormalization group analysis shows that the Heisenberg critical point flows\nto an intermediate-coupling fixed point with gapless excitations and a\nvanishing spin velocity. When the frustration is large, a spin gap opens and a\ndimer liquid is realized. Fixing $J_2 = J_1 /2$, we find, as a function of\n$\\delta$, a continuous manifold of Hamiltonians with dimer product ground\nstates, interpolating between the Majumdar-Ghosh and sawtooth spin-chain model.\nWhile the ground state is independent of the alternating next-nearest-neighbor\nexchange $\\delta$, the gap size of excitations is found to decrease with\nincreasing $\\delta$. We also extend our study to a two-dimensional double layer\nmodel with an exactly known ground state.\n", "  We present an extension of the Tomonaga-Luttinger model in which left and\nright-moving particles have different Fermi velocities. We derive expressions\nfor one-particle Green's functions, momentum-distributions, density of states,\ncharge compressibility and conductivity as functions of both the velocity\ndifference $\\epsilon$ and the strength of the interaction $\\beta$. This allows\nus to identify a novel restricted region in the parameter space in which the\nsystem keeps the main features of a Luttinger liquid but with an unusual\nbehavior of the density of states and the static charge compressibility\n$\\kappa$. In particular $\\kappa$ diverges on the boundary of the restricted\nregion, indicating the occurrence of a phase transition.\n", "  We present a theoretical survey of ferromagnetic transition temperatures in\ncubic (III,Mn)V semiconductors based on a model with $S=5/2$ local moments\nexchange-coupled to itinerant holes in the host semiconductor valence band.\nStarting from the simplest mean-field theory of this model, we estimate the\n$T_c$ enhancement due to exchange and correlation in the itinerant-hole system,\nand the $T_c$ suppression due to collective fluctuations of the ordered\nmoments. We show that high critical temperatures in these ferromagnetic\nsemiconductors require both the large magnetic susceptibility contribution from\nthe valence band's heavy holes and the large spin stiffness that results from\nstrong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band. Our calculations demonstrate\nthat this model for the ferromagnetism of these systems is fully consistent\nwith the room-temperature ferromagnetism reported for Mn doped nitrides.\n", "  Neutron scattering is used to characterise the magnetism of the vortices for\nthe optimally doped high-temperature superconductor La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4)\n(x=0.163) in an applied magnetic field. As temperature is reduced, low\nfrequency spin fluctuations first disappear with the loss of vortex mobility,\nbut then reappear. We find that the vortex state can be regarded as an\ninhomogeneous mixture of a superconducting spin fluid and a material containing\na nearly ordered antiferromagnet. These experiments show that as for many other\nproperties of cuprate superconductors, the important underlying microscopic\nforces are magnetic.\n", "  We study theoretically electron transients in semiconductor alloys excited by\nlight pulses shorter than 100 femtoseconds and tuned above the absorption edge\nduring and shortly after the pulse, when disorder scattering is dominant.\n  We use non-equilibrium Green functions employing the field-dependent\nself-consistent Born approximation. The propagators and the particle\ncorrelation function are obtained by a direct numerical solution of the Dyson\nequations in differential form. For the purely elastic scattering in our model\nsystem the solution procedures for the retarded propagator and for the\ncorrelation function can be decoupled.The propagator is used as an input in\ncalculating the correlation function. Numerical results combined with a\ncumulant expansion permit to separate in a consistent fashion the dark and the\ninduced parts of the self-energy. The dark behavior reduces to propagation of\nstrongly damped quasi-particles; the field induced self-energy leads to an\nadditional time non-local coherence. The particle correlation function is\nformed by a coherent transient and an incoherent back-scattered component. The\nparticle number is conserved only if the field induced coherence is fully\nincorporated. The transient polarization and the energy balance are also\nobtained and interpreted.\n", "  We study depinning of vortex chains in channels formed by static, disordered\nvortex arrays. Depinning is governed either by the barrier for defect\nnucleation or for defect motion, depending on whether the chain periodicity is\ncommensurate or incommensurate with the surrounding arrays. We analyze the\nreduction of the gap between these barriers as function of disorder. At large\ndisorder, commensurability becomes irrelevant and the pinning force is reduced\nto a small fraction of the ideal shear strength of ordered channels.\nImplications for experiments on channel devices are discussed.\n", "  An interesting analog circuit for simulating a signal with fluctuations\nhaving a probability density function with a power tail has recently been\nproposed and constructed. The exponent of the power law can be fixed by tuning\nan appropriate circuit element. The proposal is to use the circuit as a\nsimulator-generator of financial market fluctuations and as a tool for risk\nestimations and forecasts. We present a discussion of the stability conditions\nfor multiplicative noise and an exhaustive analysis of the power law\nfluctuation generator in connection with the electronic components and their\nparameters. From our studies one can conclude that the proposal is not adequate\nto provide a confident experimental scheme to follow the fluctuations of the\nfinancial market due to both electronic implementation and to difficulties in\nparameter tuning.\n", "  We have studied the magnetic relaxation properties of the phase-separated\nmanganite compound La0.250Pr0.375Ca0.375MnO3 . A series of polycrystalline\nsamples was prepared with different sintering temperatures, resulting in a\ncontinuous variation of phase fraction between metallic (ferromagnetic) and\ncharge-ordered phases at low temperatures. Measurements of the magnetic\nviscosity show a temperature and field dependence which can be correlated to\nthe static properties. Common to all the samples, there appears to be two types\nof relaxation processes - at low fields associated with the reorientation of\nferromagnetic domains and at higher fields associated with the transformation\nbetween ferromagnetic and non-ferromagnetic phases.\n", "  Ultra-high resolution synchrotron diffraction data for $\\rm GdBaCo_2O_{5.5}$\nthrow new light on the metal-insulator transition of Co$^{3+}$ Ba-cobaltites.\nAn anomalous expansion of CoO$_6$ octahedra is observed at the phase transition\non heating, while CoO$_5$ pyramids show the normal shrinking at the closing of\nthe gap. The insulator-to-metal transition is attributed to a sudden excitation\nof some electrons in the octahedra ($t_{2g}^6$ state) into the Co $e_g$ band\n(final $t_{2g}^4e_g^2$ state). The $t_{2g}^5e_g^1$ state in the pyramids does\nnot change and the structural study also rules out a\n$d_{3x^2-r^2}/d_{3y^2-r^2}$ orbital ordering at $T_{MI}$.\n", "  We investigate in detail the initial susceptibility, magnetization curves,\nand microstructure of ferrofluids in various concentration and particle dipole\nmoment ranges by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We use the Ewald\nsummation for the long-range dipolar interactions, take explicitly into account\nthe translational and rotational degrees of freedom, coupled to a Langevin\nthermostat. When the dipolar interaction energy is comparable with the thermal\nenergy, the simulation results on the magnetization properties agree with the\ntheoretical predictions very well. For stronger dipolar couplings, however, we\nfind systematic deviations from the theoretical curves. We analyze in detail\nthe observed microstructure of the fluids under different conditions. The\nformation of clusters is found to enhance the magnetization at weak fields and\nthus leads to a larger initial susceptibility. The influence of the particle\naggregation is isolated by studying ferro-solids, which consist of magnetic\ndipoles frozen in at random locations but which are free to rotate. Due to the\nartificial suppression of clusters in ferro-solids the observed susceptibility\nis considerably lowered when compared to ferrofluids.\n", "  We present a simple model for the electron-phonon interactions between the\nenergy subbands in polyacene field-effect transistors and the vibrations of the\ncrystal. We introduce a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, arguing that\nthe strongest electron-phonon interactions in these systems originate from the\ndependence of inter-molecule hopping amplitudes on collective molecular motion.\nWe compute the electron-phonon spectral function $\\alpha^2F(\\omega)$ as a\nfunction of two-dimensional hole density and the coupling strength constant.\nOur results are in agreement with the sharp onset of superconductivity near\nhalf-filling discovered in recent experiments by Sch\\\"on {\\it et al.} [Batlogg]\nand predict an increase of $T_c$ with pressure. We further speculate on the\nimplications that the observation of the quantum Hall effect in these systems\nhas on the effective band mass in the low carrier density regime.\n", "  We present an ab initio study of the relaxations introduced in TiO2 when a Cd\nimpurity substitutes a Ti atom and the experimental test of this calculation by\na perturbed-angular-correlation (PAC) measurement of the orientation of the\nelectric-field gradient (EFG) tensor at the Cd site. The ab-initio calculation\npredicts strong anisotropic relaxations of the nearest oxygen neighbors of the\nimpurity and a change of the orientation of the largest EFG tensor component,\nV33, from the [001] to the [110] direction upon substitution of a Ti atom by a\nCd impurity. The last prediction is confirmed by the PAC experiment that shows\nthat V33 at the Cd site is parallel to either the [110] or the [1\\bar{1}0]\ncrystal axis.\n", "  We propose a new method of direct detection of spin accumulation, which\novercomes problems of previous measurement schemes. A spin dependent current in\na single-electron transistor with ferromagnetic electrodes leads to spin\naccumulation on the metallic island. The resulting spin-splitting of the\nelectrochemical potentials of the island, because of an additional shift by the\ncharging energy, can be detected from the spacing between two resonances in the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics. The results were obtained in the framework of\na real-time diagrammatic approach which allows to study higher order\n(co-)tunneling processes in the strong nonequlibrium situation.\n", "  It has long been recognized that the key to understand kinetic friction force\n$F_k$ is the analysis of microscopic instabilities that lead to sudden\nirreversible \"pops\" of certain degrees of freedom. In this Letter, the nature\nof such instabilities is characterized with an emphasis on boundary lubricants.\nIt is shown that there are certain critical values of the parameters defining\nour model Hamiltonian, where the behavior of the instabilities changes\nqualitatively. Simultaneously, the functional dependence of $F_k$ on the\nsliding velocity $v_0$ changes. The relevant parameters studied here are\ndimensionality of the interface, degree of commensurability, first higher\nharmonic in the lubricant wall potential, and temperature. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations are carried out to test whether the predictions made on the basis\nof the simple model also hold in less idealized circumstances.\n", "  Small-world (SW) networks have been identified in many different fields.\nTopological coefficients like the clustering coefficient and the characteristic\npath length have been used in the past for a qualitative characterization of\nthese networks. Here a dynamical approach is used to characterize the\nsmall-world phenomenon. Using the $\\beta -$model, a coupled map dynamical\nsystem is defined on the network. Entrance to and exit from the SW phase are\nrelated to the behavior of the ergodic invariants of the dynamics.\n", "  In the Heisenberg antiferromagnet $Gd_2Ti_2O_7$, the exchange interactions\nare geometrically frustrated by the pyrochlore lattice structure. This ESR\nstudy reveals a strong temperature dependent anisotropy with respect to a [111]\nbody diagonal below a temperature $T_A=80$ K, despite the spin only nature of\nthe $Gd^{3+}$ ion. Anisotropy and symmetry breaking can nevertheless appear\nthrough the superexchange interaction. The presence of short range planar\ncorrelation restricted to specific Kagom\\'{e} planes is sufficient to explain\nthe two ESR modes studied in this work.\n", "  The structural and electronic properties of aluminum covered single wall\ncarbon nanotubes (SWNT) are studied from first-principles for a large number of\ncoverage. Aluminum-aluminum interaction that is stronger than aluminum-tube\ninteraction, prevents uniform metal coverage, and hence gives rise to the\nclustering. However, a stable aluminum ring and aluminum nanotube with well\ndefined patterns can also form around the semiconducting SWNT and lead to\nmetallization. The persistent current in the Al nanoring is discussed to show\nthat a high magnetic field can be induced at the center of SWNT.\n", "  NMR measurements of the electron spin polarization have been performed on a\n2D electron system at and around half-filled lowest Landau level. Comparing the\nmagnetic field and the temperature dependence of the spin polarization to\nmodels of free and interacting composite fermions (CF), we confirm the\nexistence of a Fermi sea and show that residual interactions are important.\nIndependent measurements of the CF effective mass, g-factor and Fermi energy\nare obtained from the thermal activation of the spin polarization in tilted\nfields. The filling factor dependence of the spin polarization for $2/5 < \\nu <\n2/3$ reveals a broken particle-hole symmetry for the partially polarized CF\nFermi sea.\n", "  We solve the problem of a Bose or Fermi gas in $d$-dimensions trapped by $%\n\\delta \\leq d$ mutually perpendicular harmonic oscillator potentials. From the\ngrand potential we derive their thermodynamic functions (internal energy,\nspecific heat, etc.) as well as a generalized density of states. The Bose gas\nexhibits Bose-Einstein condensation at a nonzero critical temperature $T_{c}$\nif and only if $d+\\delta >2$, and a jump in the specific heat at $T_{c}$ if and\nonly if $d+\\delta >4$. Specific heats for both gas types precisely coincide as\nfunctions of temperature when $d+\\delta =2$. The trapped system behaves like an\nideal free quantum gas in $d+\\delta $ dimensions. For $\\delta =0$ we recover\nall known thermodynamic properties of ideal quantum gases in $d$ dimensions,\nwhile in 3D for $\\delta =$ 1, 2 and 3 one simulates behavior reminiscent of\nquantum {\\it wells, wires}and{\\it dots}, respectively.\n", "  The NMR and NQR spectra of $^{63}$Cu in the CuO$_2$ plane of\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ in the superconducting state are discussed in terms of the\nphenomenological theory of Ginzburg-Landau type extended to lower temperatures.\nWe show that the observed spectra, Kumagai {\\em et al.}, PRB {\\bf 63}, 144502\n(2001), can be explained by a standard theory of the Bernoulli potential with\nthe charge transfer between CuO$_2$ planes and CuO chains assumed.\n", "  We present simulations on charged polymers in poor solvent. First we\ninvestigate in detail the dilute concentration range with and without imposed\nextension constraints. The resulting necklace polymer conformations are\nanalyzed in detail. We find strong fluctuations in the number of pearls and\ntheir sizes leading only to small signatures in the form factor and the\nforce-extension relation. The scaling of the peak in the structure factor with\nthe monomer density shows a pertinent different behavior from good solvent\nchains.\n", "  Typical properties of glassy materials are shown to be captured by a\nmean-field free-volume theory. Relaxation processes are supposed to be\nfree-volume activated, and different entropy barriers are associated with\ndensity relaxation and shear motion. Free-volume time logarithmic relaxation,\nKohlrausch-Williams-Watts, and power law viscosity result from the non-linear\ndynamics of spatially averaged quantities. The exponents associated with these\nphenomena are related to a single parameter of the theory. The theory also\naccounts for coexistence of jamming transitions and non-linear rheology.\n", "  We study a system with a weak, long-range repulsive Kac-type step-function\ninteraction within the framework of a replicated effective $\\phi^4$-theory. The\noccurrence of extensive configurational entropy, or an exponentially large\nnumber of metastable minima in the free energy (characteristic of a glassy\nstate), is demonstrated. The underlying mechanism of mesoscopic patterning and\ndefect organizations is discussed.\n", "  We study first- and second-order phase transitions of ferromagnetic lattice\nmodels on scale-free networks, with a degree exponent $\\gamma$. Using the\nexample of the $q$-state Potts model we derive a general self-consistency\nrelation within the frame of the Weiss molecular-field approximation, which\npresumably leads to exact critical singularities. Depending on the value of\n$\\gamma$, we have found three different regimes of the phase diagram. As a\ngeneral trend first-order transitions soften with decreasing $\\gamma$ and the\ncritical singularities at the second-order transitions are $\\gamma$-dependent.\n", "  We study the relaxation for growing interfaces in quenched disordered media.\nWe use a directed percolation depinning model introduced by Tang and Leschhorn\nfor 1+1-dimensions. We define the two-time autocorrelation function of the\ninterface height C(t',t) and its Fourier transform. These functions depend on\nthe difference of times t-t' for long enough times, this is the steady-state\nregime. We find a two-step relaxation decay in this regime. The long time tail\ncan be fitted by a stretched exponential relaxation function. The relaxation\ntime is proportional to the characteristic distance of the clusters of pinning\ncells in the direction parallel to the interface and it diverges as a power\nlaw. The two-step relaxation is lost at a given wave length of the Fourier\ntransform, which is proportional to the characteristic distance of the clusters\nof pinning cells in the direction perpendicular to the interface. The stretched\nexponential relaxation is caused by the existence of clusters of pinning cells\nand it is a direct consequence of the quenched noise.\n", "  We have measured the thermal conductivity tensor of a twinned\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ single crystal as a function of angle $\\theta$ between\nthe magnetic field applied parallel to the CuO$_2$ planes and the heat current\ndirection, at different magnetic fields and at T=13.8 K. Clear fourfold and\ntwofold variations in the field-angle dependence of $\\kappa_{xx}$ and\n$\\kappa_{xy}$ were respectively recorded in accordance with the d-wave pairing\nsymmetry of the order parameter. The oscillation amplitude of the transverse\nthermal conductivity $\\kappa^0_{xy}$ was found to be larger than the\nlongitudinal one $\\kappa^0_{xx}$ in the range of magnetic field studied here\n($0 T $$ \\le B \\le 9 $$T$). From our data we obtain quantities that are free\nfrom non-electronic contributions and they allow us a comparison of the\nexperimental results with current models for the quasiparticle transport in the\nmixed state.\n", "  We observe the dynamic formation of $Cs_2$ molecules near Feshbach resonances\nin a cold sample of atomic cesium using an external probe beam. This method is\n300 times more sensitive than previous atomic collision rate methods, and\nallows us to detect more than 20 weakly-coupled molecular states, with\ncollisional formation cross sections as small as $\\sigma =3\\times\n10^{-16}$cm$^2$. We propose a model to describe the atom-molecule coupling, and\nestimate that more than $2 \\times 10^5$ $Cs_2$ molecules coexist in dynamical\nequilibrium with $10^8$ $Cs$ atoms in our trap for several seconds.\n", "  Bistability in quantum dot structures is examined by a drift-diffusion model\nin combination with electron capture and emission processes. Our simulations\nprovide a dynamic scenario with extremely long switching times of the order of\nmonths and the results are in good agreement with the experimental findings of\nYusa and Sakaki [Appl. Phys. Lett. {\\bf 70}, 345 (1997)]. The analysis of the\ndata supports the importance of Auger capture processes for quantum dots.\n", "  We have studied the effect of ageing within the miscibility gap on the\nelectric, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of a non-stoichiometric Heusler\nCu-Al-Mn shape-memory alloy, which undergoes a martensitic transition from a\n$bcc$-based ($\\beta$-phase) towards a close-packed structure ($M$-phase).\nNegative magnetoresistance which shows an almost linear dependence on the\nsquare of magnetization with different slopes in the $M$- and $\\beta$-phases,\nwas observed. This magnetoresistive effect has been associated with the\nexistence of Mn-rich clusters with the Cu$_2$AlMn-structure. The effect of an\napplied magnetic field on the martensitic transition has also been studied. The\nentropy change between the $\\beta$- and $M$-phases shows negligible dependence\non the magnetic field but it decreases significantly with annealing time within\nthe miscibility gap. Such a decrease is due to the increasing amount of\nCu$_2$MnAl-rich domains that do not transform martensitically.\n", "  Previous first-principles calculations of the melting properties of Si, based\non the local-density approximation (LDA) for electronic exchange-correlation\nenergy, under-predict the melting temperature by ~ 20%. We present new\nfirst-principles results demonstrating that this problem is due to\nnon-cancellation of exchange-correlation errors between the semiconducting\nsolid and the metallic liquid. It is shown that other sources of error,\nparticularly those due to system size and Brillouin-zone sampling, can be made\nnegligible. The same LDA errors cause an underprediction of the pressure of the\ndiamond-Si --> beta-tin-Si transition. The generalized-gradient approximation\nlargely corrects both features of the Si phase diagram.\n", "  In this work we perform an ab-initio study of CdTiO3 perovskite in its\northorhombic phase using FLAPW method. Our calculations help to decide between\nthe different cristallographic structures proposed for this perovskite from\nX-Ray measurements. We compute the electric field gradient tensor (EFG) at Cd\nsite and obtain excellent agreement with available experimental information\nfrom a perturbed angular correlation (PAC) experiment. We study EFG under an\nisotropic change of volume and show that in this case the widely used \"point\ncharge model approximation\" to determine EFG works quite well.\n", "  We have studied the ionic--neutral curve crossing between the two lowest ^1\nSigma^+ states of LiF in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the quantum\nchemistry version of the density matrix renormalization group method (QC-DMRG).\nWe show that QC-DMRG is capable to calculate the ground and several low-lying\nexcited state energies within the error margin set up in advance of the\ncalculation, while with standard quantum chemical methods it is difficult to\nobtain a good approximation to Full CI property values at the point of the\navoided crossing. We have calculated the dipole moment as a function of bond\nlength, which in fact provides a smooth and continuous curve even close to the\navoided crossing, in contrast to other standard numerical treatments.\n", "  We report experimental evidences of anomalous kinetic roughening in the\nstable displacement of an oil-air interface in a Hele-Shaw cell with strong\nquenched disorder. The disorder consists on a random modulation of the gap\nspacing transverse to the growth direction (tracks). We have performed\nexperiments varying average interface velocity and gap spacing, and measured\nthe scaling exponents. We have obtained beta=0.50, beta*=0.25, alpha=1.0,\nalpha_l=0.5, and z=2. When there is no fluid injection, the interface is driven\nsolely by capillary forces, and a higher value of beta around beta=0.65 is\nmeasured. The presence of multiscaling and the particular morphology of the\ninterfaces, characterized by high slopes that follow a L\\'evy distribution,\nconfirms the existence of anomalous scaling. From a detailed study of the\nmotion of the oil--air interface we show that the anomaly is a consequence of\ndifferent local velocities over tracks plus the coupling in the motion between\nneighboring tracks. The anomaly disappears at high interface velocities, weak\ncapillary forces, or when the disorder is not sufficiently persistent in the\ngrowth direction. We have also observed the absence of scaling when the\ndisorder is very strong or when a regular modulation of the gap spacing is\nintroduced.\n", "  We show that the electronic and atomic structure of carbon nanotubes undergo\ndramatic changes with hydrogen chemisorption from first principle calculations.\nUpon uniform exohydrogenation at half coverage, the cross sections of zigzag\nnanotubes become literally square or rectangular, and they are metallic with\nvery high density of states at the Fermi level, while other isomers can be\ninsulating. For both zigzag and armchair nanotubes, hydrogenation of each\ncarbon atom from inside and outside alternatively yield the most stable isomer\nwith a very weak curvature dependence and a large band gap.\n", "  We examine a model of biological evolution of Eigen's quasispecies in a holey\nfitness landscape, where the fitness of a site is either 0 (lethal site) or a\nuniform positive constant (viable site). So, the evolution dynamics is\ndetermined by the topology of the genome space. It is modeled by the random\nBethe lattice. We use the effective medium and single-defect approximations to\nfind the criteria, under which the localized quasispecies cloud is created. We\nfind that shorter genomes, which are more robust to random mutations than\naverage, represent a selective advantage which we call ``topological''. A way\nof assessing empirically the relative importance of reproductive success and\ntopological advantage is suggested.\n", "  The tunneling rate of a skyrmion in ferromagnetic spin-1/2 Bose condensates\nthrough an off-centered potential barrier is calculated exactly with the\nperiodic instanton method. The prefactor is shown to depend on the chemical\npotential of the core atoms, at which level the atom tunnels. Our results can\nbe readily extended to estimate the lifetime of other topological excitations\nin the condensate, such as vortices and monopoles.\n", "  The equations-of-motion for the density matrix are derived in a multiband\nmodel to describe the response of semiconductors (bulk or quantum well\nstructures) under optical excitation with arbitrary polarization. The multiband\nmodel used, comprising the twofold conduction band and the fourfold topmost\nvalence band (or heavy- and light-hole states), incorporates spin-splitting of\nthe single-particle states. The interaction terms include besides the direct\nCoulomb coupling between carriers also the electron-hole exchange interaction,\nwhich together with the spin-splitting terms is responsible for spin\nrelaxation. Applying the Hartree-Fock truncation scheme leads to a set of\ncoherent semiconductor Bloch equations for the multiband case. This concept\nprovides the theoretical frame for describing phenomena connected with optical\nresponse under excitation with arbitrary light polarization and spin\nrelaxation: polarized optical response, polarization dynamics of VCSELs, spin\nrelaxation, and the circular photovoltaic effect.\n", "  We consider a model of Fermi-Bose mixture with strong hard-core repulsion\nbetween particles of the same sort and attraction between particles of\ndifferent sorts. In this case, besides the standard anomalous averages of the\ntype $<b>$; $<bb>$ and $<cc>$, a pairing between fermion and boson of the type\n$bc$ is possible. This pairing corresponds to a creation of composite fermions\nin the system. At low temperatures and equal densities of fermions and bosons\ncomposite fermions are further paired in quartets. Our investigations are\nimportant for high-$T_c$ superconductors and in connection with recent\nobservation of weakly bound dimers in magnetic traps at ultralow temperatures.\n", "  We show that nonequilibrium spin fluctuations significantly influence the\nelectronic transport in a single-electron transistor, when the spin relaxation\non the island is slow compared to other relaxation processes, and when size\neffects play a role. To describe spin fluctuations we generalize the `orthodox'\ntunneling theory to take into account the electron spin, and show that the\ntransition between consecutive charge states can occur via a high-spin state.\nThis significantly modifies the shape of Coulomb steps and gives rise to\nadditional resonances at low temperatures. Recently some of our predictions\nwere confirmed by Fujisawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 236802 (2002)], who\ndemonstrated experimentally the importance of nonequilibrum spin fluctuations\nin transport through quantum dots.\n", "  We present a detailed numerical analysis of the effect of a magnetic field on\nthe transport properties of a `small-$N$' one-sided surface disordered wire.\nWhen time reversal symmetry is broken due to a magnetic field $B$, we find a\nstrong increase with $B$ not only of the localization length $\\xi$ but also of\nthe mean free path $\\ell$ caused by boundary states. Despite this, the\nuniversal relationship between $\\ell$ and $\\xi$ does hold. We also analyze the\nconductance distribution at the metal-insulator crossover, finding a very good\nagreement with Random Matrix Theory with two fluctuating channels within the\nCircular Orthogonal(Unitary) Ensemble in absence(presence) of $B$\n", "  In the two-leg S=1/2 ladders of Sr_14Cu_24O_41 a modulation of the exchange\ncoupling arises from the charge order within the other structural element, the\nCuO_2 chains. In general, breaking translational invariance by modulation\ncauses gaps within the dispersion of elementary excitations. We show that the\ngap induced by the charge order can drastically change the magnetic Raman\nspectrum leading to the sharp peak observed in Sr_14Cu_24O_41. This sharp Raman\nline gives insight in the charge-order periodicity and hence in the\ndistribution of carriers. The much broader spectrum of La_6Ca_8Cu_24O$_41\nreflects the response of an undoped ladder in the absence of charge order.\n", "  Using a metric related to the returns correlation, a method is proposed to\nreconstruct an economic space from the market data. A reduced subspace,\nassociated to the systematic structure of the market, is identified and its\ndimension related to the number of terms in factor models. Example were worked\nout involving sets of companies from the DJIA and S&P500 indexes. Having a\nmetric defined in the space of companies, network topology coefficients may be\nused to extract further information from the data. A notion of \"continuous\nclustering\" is defined and empirically related to the occurrence of market\nshocks.\n", "  We calculate certain features of Bose-Einstein condensation in the ideal gas\nby using recurrence relations for the partition function. The grand canonical\nensemble gives inaccurate results for certain properties of the condensate that\nare accurately provided by the canonical ensemble. Calculations in the latter\ncan be made tractable for finite systems by means of the recurrence relations.\nThe ideal one-dimensional harmonic Bose gas provides a particularly simple and\npedagogically useful model for which detailed results are easily derived. An\nanalysis of the Bose system via permutation cycles yields insight into the\nphysical meaning of the recurrence relations.\n", "  The low temperature behavior of Pr$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$MnO$_{3}$ manganites are\nknown to undergo a transition at $x\\sim$0.3, from an insulating ferromagnetic\nstate, at low Ca concentration, to an insulating antiferromagnetic state. Above\nthe onset concentration for the charge-ordering effect ($x\\sim 0.3$), a\nmetal-insulator transition induced by an external magnetic field is also\nobserved and related to the collapse of the charge-ordered state. In this paper\nwe show that the ferro-antiferromagnetic transition takes place in an\ninhomogeneous way: around the critical concentration the sample is a mixture of\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic regions. The zero-field NMR measurements\nshow that a fraction of the ferromagnetic regions is in a fast hopping regime,\nwhich suggests that a small fraction of the sample could be metallic, even in\nzero field. This fraction of fast hopping regions is maximal at $x=$0.3, which\nis also the concentration for which the insulator-metal transition has been\nobserved in the smallest field.\n", "  Chromatin is a complex of DNA and specific proteins forming an intermediary\nlevel of organization of eukaryotic genomes, between double-stranded DNA and\nchromosome. Within a generic modeling of the chromatin assembly, we investigate\nthe interplay between the mechanical properties of the chromatin fiber and its\nbiological functions. A quantitative step is to relate the mechanics at the DNA\nlevel and the mechanics described at the chromatin fiber level. It allows to\ncalculate the complete set of chromatin elastic constants (twist and bend\npersistence lengths, stretch modulus and twist-stretch coupling constant), in\nterms of DNA elastic properties and geometric features of the fiber. These\nelastic constants are strongly sensitive to the local architecture of the fiber\nand we argue that this tunable elasticity might be a key feature in chromatin\nfunctions, for instance in the initiation and regulation of transcription.\nMoreover, this analysis provides a framework to interpret micromanipulations\nstudies of chromatin fiber and suggests further experiments involving\nintercalators to scan the tunable elasticity of the fiber.\n", "  The chromatin fiber is a complex of DNA and specific proteins called histones\nforming the first structural level of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes.\nIn tightly organized chromatin fibers, the short segments of naked DNA linking\nthe nucleosomes are strongly end constrained. Longitudinal thermal fluctuations\nin these linkers allow intercalative mode of protein binding. We show that\nmechanical constraints generated in the first stage of the binding process\ninduce linker DNA buckling; buckling in turn modifies the binding energies and\nactivation barriers and creates a force of decondensation at the chromatin\nfiber level. The unique structure and properties of DNA thus yield a novel\nphysical mechanism of buckling instability that might play a key role in the\nregulation of gene expression.\n", "  The evolution of the structure and conductance of an Al nanowire subject to a\ntensile stress has been studied by first-principles total-energy simulations.\nOur calculations show the correlation between discontinuous changes in the\nforce (associated to changes in the bonding structure of the nanowire) and\nabrupt modifications of the conductance as the nanowire develops a thinner\nneck, in agreement with the experiments. We reproduce the characteristic\nincrease of the conductance in the last plateau, reaching a value close to the\nconductance quantum $G_0 = 2 e^2 / h$ before the breaking of the nanowire. A\ndimer defines the contact geometry at these last stages, with three channels\n(one dominant) contributing to the conductance.\n", "  We present a study of the magnetic properties of YNiO$_{3}$ in the\nparamagnetic range, above and below the metal-insulator (MI) transition. The dc\nsusceptibility, $\\chi_{dc}$ (measured up to 1000 K) is a decreasing function of\nT for $T >$150 K (the N\\'{e}el temperature) and we observe two different\nCurie-Weiss regimes corresponding to the metallic and insulator phases. In the\nmetallic phase, this behaviour seems to be associated with the small ionic\nradius of Y% $^{3+}$. The value of the Curie constant for T$<$ T$_{MI}$ allows\nus to discard the possibility of Ni$^{3+}$ localization. An electron spin\nresonance (ESR) spectrum is visible in the insulator phase and only a fraction\nof the Ni ions contributes to this resonance. We explain the ESR and $\\chi\n_{dc}$ behaviour for T $<$ T$_{MI}$ in terms of charge disproportionation of\nthe type 2Ni$% ^{3+}\\to $ Ni$^{2+}$+Ni$^{4+},$ that is compatible with the\npreviously observed structural transition across T$_{MI}$.\n", "  In the context of the phenomenon of Stochastic Resonance (SR) we study the\ncorrelation function, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the ratio of output\nover input SNR, i.e. the gain, which is associated to the nonlinear response of\na bistable system driven by time-periodic forces and white Gaussian noise.\nThese quantifiers for SR are evaluated using the techniques of Linear Response\nTheory (LRT) beyond the usually employed two-mode approximation scheme. We\nanalytically demonstrate within such an extended LRT description that the gain\ncan indeed not exceed unity. We implement an efficient algorithm, based on work\nby Greenside and Helfand (detailed in the Appendix), to integrate the driven\nLangevin equation over a wide range of parameter values. The predictions of LRT\nare carefully tested against the results obtained from numerical solutions of\nthe corresponding Langevin equation over a wide range of parameter values. We\nfurther present an accurate procedure to evaluate the distinct contributions of\nthe coherent and incoherent parts of the correlation function to the SNR and\nthe gain. As a main result we show for subthreshold driving that both, the\ncorrelation function and the SNR can deviate substantially from the predictions\nof LRT and yet, the gain can be either larger or smaller than unity. In\nparticular, we find that the gain can exceed unity in the strongly nonlinear\nregime which is characterized by weak noise and very slow multifrequency\nsubthreshold input signals with a small duty cycle. This latter result is in\nagreement with recent analogue simulation results by Gingl et al. in Refs. [18,\n19].\n", "  The angle dependence at different temperatures of the longitudinal thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa_{xx}(\\theta)$ in the presence of a planar magnetic field\nis presented. In order to study the influence of the gap symmetry on the\nthermal transport angular scans were measured up to a few Kelvin below the\ncritical temperature $T_c$. We found that the four-fold oscillation of\n$\\kappa_{xx}(\\theta)$ vanishes at $T > 20 $K and transforms into a one-fold\noscillation with maximum conductivity for a field of 8 T applied parallel to\nthe heat current. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the d-wave pairing\nsymmetry is the main pairing symmetry of the order parameter up to $T_c$.\nNumerical results of the thermal conductivity using an Andreev reflection model\nfor the scattering of quasiparticles by supercurrents under the assumption of\nd-wave symmetry provide a semiquantitative description of the overall results.\n", "  The magnetic properties of CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ at microkelvin temperatures (down\nto 170 $\\mu$K) and ultra small magnetic fields ($0.02\\sim6.21$ mT) are\ninvestigated experimentally for the first time. The simultaneously measured ac\nsusceptibility and static magnetization show neither evidence of the magnetic\nordering, superconductivity down to the lowest temperatures nor conventional\nLandau Fermi-Liquid behavior. The results imply the magnetic transition\ntemperature in undoped CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ is very close to absolute 0 K. The\npossibility for proximity of CeRu$_2$Si$_2$ to the quantum critical point\nwithout any doping is discussed.\n", "  Normal behavior of the thermodynamic properties of a Fermi gas in $d>2$\ndimensions, integer or not, means monotonically increasing or decreasing of its\nspecific heat, chemical potential or isothermal sound velocity, all as\nfunctions of temperature. However, for $0<d<2$ dimensions these properties\ndevelop a ``hump'' (or ``trough'') which increases (or deepens) as $d\\to 0$.\nThough not the phase transition signaled by the sharp features (``cusp'' or\n``jump'') in those properties for the ideal Bose gas in $d>2$ (known as the\nBose-Einstein condensation), it is nevertheless an intriguing structural\nanomaly which we exhibit in detail.\n", "  We present a neutron scattering investigation on methyl group dynamics in\nglassy toluene confined in mesoporous silicates of different pore sizes. The\nexperimental results have been analysed in terms of a barrier distribution\nmodel, such a distribution following from the structural disorder in the glassy\nstate. Confinement results in a strong decreasing of the average rotational\nbarrier in comparison to the bulk state. We have roughly separated the\ndistribution for the confined state in a bulk-like and a surface-like\ncontribution, corresponding to rotors at a distance from the pore wall\nrespectively larger and smaller than the spatial range of the interactions\nwhich contribute to the rotational potential for the methyl groups. We have\nestimated a distance of 7 Amstrong as a lower limit of the interaction range,\nbeyond the typical nearest-neighbour distance between centers-of-mass (4.7\nAmstrong).\n", "  We present results of the thermal conductivity of $\\rm La_2CuO_4$ and $\\rm\nLa_{1.8}Eu_{0.2}CuO_4$ single-crystals which represent model systems for the\ntwo-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice. We\nfind large anisotropies of the thermal conductivity, which are explained in\nterms of two-dimensional heat conduction by magnons within the CuO$_2$ planes.\nNon-magnetic Zn substituted for Cu gradually suppresses this magnon thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$. A semiclassical analysis of\n$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$ is shown to yield a magnon mean free path which scales\nlinearly with the reciprocal concentration of Zn-ions.\n", "  The ferromagnetic Kondo model with classical corespins is studied via\nunbiased Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that with realistic parameters for\nthe manganites and at low temperatures, the double-exchange mechanism does not\nlead to phase separation in one-dimensional chains but rather stabilizes\nindividual ferromagnetic polarons. Within the ferromagnetic polaron picture,\nthe pseudogap in the one-particle spectral function A_k(\\omega) can easily be\nexplained. Ferromagnetic polarons also clear up a seeming failure of the\ndouble-exchange mechanism in explaining the comparable bandwidths in the\nferromagnetic and paramagnetic phase. For our analysis, we extend a simplified\nmodel, the finite temperature uniform hopping approach (UHA), to include\npolarons. It can easily be evaluated numerically and provides a simple\nquantitative understanding of the physical features of the ferromagnetic Kondo\nmodel.\n", "  We supplement (and critically overview) the existing extensive analysis of\nantiferromagnetic solution for the Hubbard model with a detailed discussion of\ntwo specific features, namely (i) the evolution of the magnetic (Slater) gap\n(here renormalized by the electronic correlations) into the Mott-Hubbard or\natomic gap, and (ii) a rather weak renormalization of the effective mass by the\ncorrelations in the half-filled-band case, which contrasts with that for the\nparamagnetic case. The mass remains strongly enhanced in the\nnon-half-filled-band case. We also stress the difference between magnetic and\nnon-magnetic contributions to the gap. These results are discussed within the\nslave boson approach in the saddle-point approximation, in which there appears\na non-linear staggered molecular field due to the electronic correlations that\nleads to the appearance of the magnetic gap. They reproduce correctly the\nground-state energy in the limit of strong correlations. A brief comparison\nwith the solution in the limit of infinite dimensions and the corresponding\nsituation in the doubly-degenerate-band case with one electron per atom is also\nmade.\n", "  Current experimental results suggest that some organic quasi-one-dimensional\nsuperconductors exhibit triplet pairing symmetry. Thus, we discuss several\npotential triplet order parameters for the superconducting state of these\nsystems within the functional integral formulation. We compare weak spin-orbit\ncoupling $f_{xyz}$, $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$ symmetries via several thermodynamic\nquantities. For each symmetry, we analyse the temperature dependences of the\norder parameter, condensation energy, specific heat, and superfluid density\ntensor.\n", "  The phase transition in the number partitioning problem (NPP), i.e., the\ntransition from a region in the space of control parameters in which almost all\ninstances have many solutions to a region in which almost all instances have no\nsolution, is investigated by examining the energy landscape of this classic\noptimization problem. This is achieved by coding the information about the\nminimum energy paths connecting pairs of minima into a tree structure, termed a\nbarrier tree, the leaves and internal nodes of which represent, respectively,\nthe minima and the lowest energy saddles connecting those minima. Here we apply\nseveral measures of shape (balance and symmetry) as well as of branch lengths\n(barrier heights) to the barrier trees that result from the landscape of the\nNPP, aiming at identifying traces of the easy/hard transition. We find that it\nis not possible to tell the easy regime from the hard one by visual inspection\nof the trees or by measuring the barrier heights. Only the {\\it difficulty}\nmeasure, given by the maximum value of the ratio between the barrier height and\nthe energy surplus of local minima, succeeded in detecting traces of the phase\ntransition in the tree. In adddition, we show that the barrier trees associated\nwith the NPP are very similar to random trees, contrasting dramatically with\ntrees associated with the $p$ spin-glass and random energy models. We also\nexamine critically a recent conjecture on the equivalence between the NPP and a\ntruncated random energy model.\n", "  We have observed spontaneous fluxoid generation in thin-film rings of the\namorphous superconductor Mo$_3$Si, cooled through the normal-superconducting\ntransition, as a function of quench rate and externally applied magnetic field,\nusing a variable sample temperature scanning SQUID microscope. Our results can\nbe explained using a model of freezout of thermally activated fluxoids,\nmediated by the transport of bulk vortices across the ring walls. This\nmechanism is complementary to a mechanism proposed by Kibble and Zurek, which\nonly relies on causality to produce a freezout of order parameter fluctuations.\n", "  We present experimental results on slow flow properties of a granular\nassembly confined in a vertical column and driven upwards at a constant\nvelocity V. For monodisperse assemblies this study evidences at low velocities\n($1<V<100 \\mu m/s$) a stiffening behaviour i.e. the stress necessary to obtain\na steady sate velocity increases roughly logarithmically with velocity. On the\nother hand, at very low driving velocity ($V<1 \\mu m/s$), we evidence a\ndiscontinuous and hysteretic transition to a stick-slip regime characterized by\na strong divergence of the maximal blockage force when the velocity goes to\nzero. We show that all this phenomenology is strongly influenced by surrounding\nhumidity. We also present a tentative to establish a link between the granular\nrheology and the solid friction forces between the wall and the grains. We base\nour discussions on a simple theoretical model and independent grain/wall\ntribology measurements. We also use finite elements numerical simulations to\nconfront experimental results to isotropic elasticity. A second system made of\npolydisperse assemblies of glass beads is investigated. We emphasize the onset\nof a new dynamical behavior, i.e. the large distribution of blockage forces\nevidenced in the stick-slip regime.\n", "  We use a mapping of the multiband Hubbard model for $CuO_{3}$ chains in\n$RBa_{2}Cu_{3}0_{6+x}$ (R=Y or a rare earth) onto a $t-J$ model and the\ndescription of the charge dynamics of the latter in terms pf s spinless model,\nto study the electronic structure of the chains. We briefly review results for\nthe optical conductivity and we calculate the quantum phase diagram of quarter\nfilled chains including Coulomb repulsion up to that between\nnext-nearest-neighbor $Cu$ atoms $V_{2}$, using the resulting effective\nHamiltonian, mapped onto an XXZ chain, and the method of crossing of excitation\nspectra. The method gives accurate results for the boundaries of the metallic\nphase in this case. The inclusion of $V_{2}$ greatly enhances the region of\nmetallic behavior of the chains.\n", "  This paper considers the self-consistent Coulomb interaction within arrays of\nself-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs) which are embedded in a pn structure.\nStrong emphasis is being put on the statistical occupation of the electronic QD\nstates which has to be solved self-consistently with the actual\nthree-dimensional potential distribution. A model which is based on a Green's\nfunction formalism including screening effects is used to calculate the\ninteraction of QD carriers within an array of QDs, where screening due to the\ninhomogeneous bulk charge distribution is taken into acount. We apply our model\nto simulate capacitance-voltage (CV) characteristics of a pn structure with\nembedded QDs. Different size distributions of QDs and ensembles of spatially\nperodic and randomly distributed arrays of QDs are investigated.\n", "  LaTiO$_3$ is known as Mott-insulator which orders antiferromagnetically at\n$T_{\\rm N}=146$ K. We report on results of thermal expansion and temperature\ndependent x-ray diffraction together with measurements of the heat capacity,\nelectrical transport measurements, and optical spectroscopy in untwinned single\ncrystals. At $T_{\\rm N}$ significant structural changes appear, which are\nvolume conserving. Concomitant anomalies are also observed in the\ndc-resistivity, in bulk modulus, and optical reflectivity spectra. We interpret\nthese experimental observations as evidence of orbital order.\n", "  We present a detailed semiclassical study of a clean disk--shaped\ninsulator--normal-metal--superconductor hybrid system in a magnetic field. It\nis based on an exact secular equation that we derived within the microscopic\nBogoliubov--de Gennes (BdG) formalism. Results obtained from a classification\nof electron and hole orbits are in excellent agreement with those from an exact\nnumerical diagonalization of the BdG equation. Our analysis opens up new\npossibilities for determining thermodynamic properties of mesoscopic hybrid\nsystems.\n", "  The far-infrared dielectric response of superlattices (SL) composed of\nsuperconducting YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$ (YBCO) and ferromagnetic La$_{0.67}$%\nCa$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LCMO) has been investigated by ellipsometry. A drastic\ndecrease of the free carrier response is observed which involves an unusually\nlarge length scale of d$^{crit}\\approx $20 nm in YBCO and d$^{crit}\\approx $10\nnm in LCMO. A corresponding suppression of metallicity is not observed in SLs\nwhere LCMO is replaced by the paramagnetic metal LaNiO$_{3}$. Our data suggest\nthat either a long range charge transfer from the YBCO to the LCMO layers or\nalternatively a strong coupling of the charge carriers to the different and\ncompetitive kind of magnetic correlations in the LCMO and YBCO layers are at\nthe heart of the observed metal/insulator transition. The low free carrier\nresponse observed in the far-infrared dielectric response of the magnetic\nsuperconductor RuSr$_{2}$GdCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ is possibly related to this effect.\n", "  We have experimentally studied the energy levels of a mesoscopic SQUID using\ninelastic Cooper-pair tunneling. The tunneling in a small Josephson junction\ndepends strongly on its electromagnetic environment. We use this fact to do\nenergy level spectroscopy of a SQUID-loop by coupling it to a small junction.\nOur samples with strong quasiparticle dissipation are well described by a model\nof a particle localized in one of the dips in a cosine-potential, while in the\nsamples with weak dissipation we can see formation of energy bands.\n", "  We have studied by Monte Carlo simulations the thermal behaviour of a small\n(N=13 particles) cluster described by a Heisenberg model, including\nnearest-neighbour ferromagnetic interactions and radial surface anisotropy, in\nan applied magnetic field. We have studied three different lattice structures:\nhexagonal close packed, face centered cubic and icosahedral. We show that the\nzero-field thermal behaviour depends not only on the value of the anisotropy\nconstant but also on the lattice structure. The behaviour in an applied field,\nadditionally depends, on the different orientations of the field with respect\nto the crystal axes. According to these relative orientations, hysteresis\ncycles show different step-like characteristics.\n", "  We investigate the phonon thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ of\ndoped $\\rm La_2CuO_4$ based on out-of-plane thermal conductivity measurements.\nWhen room temperature is approached the temperature dependence of\n$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ strongly deviates from the $T^{-1}$-decrease which is\nusually expected for heat transport by acoustic phonons. Instead,\n$\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ decreases much weaker or even increases with rising\ntemperature. Simple arguments suggest that such unusual temperature\ndependencies of $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ are caused by heat transport via\ndispersive optical phonons.\n", "  We present magnetotransport calculations for homogeneous two-dimensional\nelectron systems including the Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which mixes the\nspin-eigenstates and leads to a modified fan-chart with crossing Landau levels.\nThe quantum mechanical Kubo formula is evaluated by taking into account\nspin-conserving scatterers in an extension of the self-consistent Born\napproximation that considers the spin degree of freedom. The calculated\nconductivity exhibits besides the well-known beating in the Shubnikov-de Haas\n(SdH) oscillations a modulation which is due to a suppression of scattering\naway from the crossing points of Landau levels and does not show up in the\ndensity of states. This modulation, surviving even at elevated temperatures\nwhen the SdH oscillations are damped out, could serve to identify spin-orbit\ncoupling in magnetotransport experiments. Our magnetotransport calculations are\nextended also to lateral superlattices and predictions are made with respect to\n1/B periodic oscillations in dependence on carrier density and strength of the\nspin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We present a detailed experimental study of the velocity distribution of\natoms cooled in an optical lattice. Our results are supported by full-quantum\nnumerical simulations. Even though the Sisyphus effect, the responsible cooling\nmechanism, has been used extensively in many cold atom experiments, no detailed\nstudy of the velocity distribution has been reported previously. For the\nexperimental as well as for the numerical investigation, it turns out that a\nGaussian function is not the one that best reproduce the data for all\nparameters. We also fit the data to alternative functions, such as Lorentzians,\nTsallis functions and double Gaussians. In particular, a double Gaussian\nprovides a more precise fitting to our results.\n", "  The magnetization of a thin Fe-Co cyanide film has been investigated from 5 K\nto 300 K and in fields up to 500 G. Upon illumination with visible light, the\nmagnetization of the film rapidly increases. The original cluster glass\nbehavior is further developed in the photoinduced state and shows substantial\nchanges in critical temperature and freezing temperature.\n", "  We have measured the temperature driven denaturing, or melting transition in\npoly d(A)-poly d(T) DNA oligomers of various lengths in different buffer\nconditions. Our findings are in clear disagreement with two state, reaction\nkinetics model, and we find that the so-called zipper model, where denaturing\nproceeds through opening of the duplex at the ends describes well the\ntemperature dependence of the average number of open base pairs. Analysis of\nthe length dependence of the transition parameters however suggest that bubble\nformation is important and that the transition, in the thermodynamic limit, is\ncontinuous, albeit close to first order.\n", "  By means of high resolution neutron powder diffraction at low temperature we\nhave characterized the structural details of $\\rm La_{x}Sr_{2-x}FeMoO_6$\n($0\\leq {\\rm x}\\leq 0.5$) and $\\rm Ca_{x}Sr_{2-x}FeMoO_6$ ($0\\leq {\\rm x}\\leq\n0.6$) series of compounds. This study reveals a similar variation of the mean\nbond-angle \\FeOMo in both series. In contrast, the mean bond-distance \\FeMoO\\\nincreases with La but not with Ca substitution. Both series also present a\ndifferent evolution of the Curie temperature ($T_C$), which raises in the La\nseries and slightly decreases in the Ca one. We thus conclude that the\nenhancement of $T_C$ in the La series is due to the electron filling of the\nconduction band and a concomitant rising of the density of states at the Fermi\nlevel.\n", "  This comment points out that the recent paper by Maki and Haas [Phys. Rev. B\n{\\bf 67}, 020510 (2003)] is completely wrong.\n", "  We have prepared solutions of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in Aroclor 1254, a\nmixture of polychlorinated biphenyls. The solutions are stable at room\ntemperature. Transport measurements were performed using a scanning--tunneling\nprobe on a sample prepared by spin--coating of the solution on gold substrates.\nConductance steps were clearly seen. An histogram of a high number of traces\nshows maximum peaks at integer values of the conductance quantum $G_0 =\n2e^2/h$, demonstrating ballistic transport at room temperature along the carbon\nnanotube over distances longer than $1.4\\mu m$.\n", "  Results of in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity measurements on\n$\\rm La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$ ($0\\leq x\\leq0.2$) single crystals are\npresented. The most characteristic features of the temperature dependence are a\npronounced phonon peak at low temperatures and a steplike anomaly at $T_{LT}$,\ni.e., at the transition to the low temperature tetragonal phase (LTT-phase),\nwhich gradually decrease with increasing Sr-content. Comparison of these\nfindings with the thermal conductivity of $\\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ and $\\rm\nLa_2NiO_4$ clearly reveals that in $\\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$ the most effective\nmechanism for phonon scattering is impurity-scattering (dopants), as well as\nscattering by soft phonons that are associated with the lattice instability in\nthe low temperature orthorhombic phase (LTO-phase). There is no evidence that\nstripe correlations play a major role in suppressing the phonon peak in the\nthermal conductivity of $\\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$.\n", "  We investigate the topological defects in atomic spin-1 and spin-2\nBose-Einstein condensates by applying the homotopy group theory. With this\nrigorous approach we clarify the previously controversial identification of\nsymmetry groups and order parameter spaces for the spin-1 case, and show that\nthe spin-2 case provides a rare example of a physical system with non-Abelian\nline defects, and the possibility to have winding numbers of 1/3 and its\nmultiples.\n", "  We investigate the structure of topological defects in the ground states of\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensates with spin F=1 or F=2. The type and number of\ndefects are determined by calculating the first and second homotopy groups of\nthe order-parameter space. The order-parameter space is identified with a set\nof degenerate ground state spinors. Because the structure of the ground state\ndepends on whether or not there is an external magnetic field applied to the\nsystem, defects are sensitive to the magnetic field. We study both cases and\nfind that the defects in zero and non-zero field are different.\n", "  The thickness $W$ and the surface energy $\\sigma_A$ at the free interface of\nsuperfluid $^4$He are studied. Results of calculations carried out by using\ndensity functionals for cylindrical and spherical systems are presented in a\nunified way, including a comparison with the behavior of planar slabs. It is\nfound that for large species $W$ is independent of the geometry. The obtained\nvalues of $W$ are compared with prior theoretical results and experimental\ndata. Experimental data favor results evaluated by adopting finite range\napproaches. The behavior of $\\sigma_A$ and $W \\sigma_A$ exhibit overshoots\nsimilar to that found previously for the central density, the trend of these\nobservables towards their asymptotic values is examined.\n", "  We have measured magnetotransport of the two-dimensional electron gas in a\nHall bar geometry in the presence of small carrier density gradients. We find\nthat the longitudinal resistances measured at both sides of the Hall bar\ninterchange by reversing the polarity of the magnetic field. We offer a simple\nexplanation for this effect and discuss implications for extracting\nconductivity flow diagrams of the integer quantum Hall effect.\n", "  The adsorption of $^4$He inside and outside a single fullerene C$_{60}$ is\nstudied. A physisorption potential is proposed. The energetics and structural\nfeatures of C$_{60}$-$^4$He$_N$ clusters are investigated. Particular attention\nis paid to the growth of the highly pronounced layered density profile. The\nevolution towards bulk liquid and surface thickness at the free interface are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We compute correlation functions for one-dimensional electron systems which\nspin and charge degrees of freedom are coupled through spin-orbit coupling.\nCharge density waves, spin density waves, singlet- triplet- superconducting\nfluctuations are studied. We show that the spin-orbit interaction modify the\nexponents and the phase diagram of the system, changing the dominant\nfluctuations and making new susceptibilities diverge for low temperature.\n", "  Following the experimental observation of bright matter-wave solitons [L.\nKhaykovich et al., Science v. 296, 1290 (2002); K. E. Strecker et al., Nature\n(London) v. 417, 150 (2002)], we develop a semi-phenomenological theory for\nsoliton thermodynamics and find the condensation temperature. Under a modified\nthermodynamic limit, the condensate occupation at the critical temperature\nundergoes a sudden jump to a nonzero value, indicating a discontinuous phase\ntransition. Treating the condensation as a diffusion over a barrier shows that\nthe condensation time is exponentially long as one approaches the thermodynamic\nlimit, and the longest near the critical temperature.\n", "  The critical state problem in type-II superconductivity is described\ntheoretically by a direct optimization method, which allows a straightforward\ntreatment for non idealized geometries.\n  Based on Faraday's law and the principle of minimum entropy production, the\nmagnetic history is built up just by a constrained minimization of the field\nchanges along the process. Constraints are in the form $\\vec{J}\\in\\Delta$, with\n$\\vec{J}$ the electric current density and $\\Delta$ some bounded set. This\nincorporates the vortex pinning and interaction phenomena and may be used for\nthe modelling of anisotropy, inhomogeneities and flux cutting interactions.\n  In this work, our variational statement is posed on the finite element\ndiscretization and provides a minimal tool for investigating the effects of the\nsample's topology on the field penetration patterns. Simulations of (i) the\ncontraction and splitting of boundaries between the flux free and penetrated\nregions, (ii) the effect of granularity on the superconducting properties,\n(iii) the influence of defects, and (iv) surface curvature phenomena are\npresented.\n", "  We report measurements of the complex resistivity in $YBCO$ and $MgB_2$ thin\nfilms over a continuous frequency spectrum in the microwave range, making use\nof a Corbino disk geometry. The paper mainly focuses on the extraction of the\nresistivity from raw data, displaying data analisys procedure and its limits of\nvalidity. We obtain and show resistivity curves as a function of frequency and\ntemperature denoting a frequency dependent widening of the superconductive\ntransition.\n", "  Constitutive equations are proposed for the relaxation of a glassy material\nin contact with a thermal reservoir. The dynamics of a single state variable,\nidentified as an effective temperature accounts for the emergence of glassy\nbehavior at low bath temperature. Memory effect in cooling/reheating\nexperiments are discussed along with several aspects of the response to shear:\naging of the response to step strains, response to oscillatory forcing, and\nsteady rheology.\n", "  We report experimental results for the behavior of slow-combustion fronts in\nthe presence of a columnar defect with excess or reduced driving, and compare\nthem with those of mean-field theory. We also compare them with simulation\nresults for an analogous problem of driven flow of particles with hard-core\nrepulsion (ASEP) and a single defect bond with a different hopping probability.\nThe difference in the shape of the front profiles for excess vs. reduced\ndriving in the defect, clearly demonstrates the existence of a KPZ-type of\nnonlinear term in the effective evolution equation for the slow-combustion\nfronts. We also find that slow-combustion fronts display a faceted form for\nlarge enough excess driving, and that there is a corresponding increase then in\nthe average front speed. This increase in the average front speed disappears at\na non-zero excess driving in agreement with the simulated behavior of the ASEP\nmodel.\n", "  The main objective of this work is to explore aspects of stochastic resonance\n(SR) in noisy bistable, symmetric systems driven by subthreshold periodic\nrectangular external signals possessing a large duty cycle of unity. Using a\nprecise numerical solution of the Langevin equation, we carry out a detailed\nanalysis of the behavior of the first two cumulant averages, the correlation\nfunction and its coherent and incoherent parts. We also depict the\nnon-monotonic behavior versus the noise strength of several SR quantifiers such\nas the average output amplitude, i.e. the spectral amplification (SPA), the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the SR-gain. In particular, we find that with\nsubthreshold amplitudes and for an appropriate duration of the pulses of the\ndriving force the phenomenon of stochastic resonance (SR), is accompanied by\nSR-gains exceeding unity. This analysis thus sheds new light onto the interplay\nbetween nonlinearity and the nonlinear response which in turn yields\nnontrivial, unexpected SR-gains above unity.\n", "  The classical lattice dynamics of honeycomb lattices is studied in the\nharmonic approximation. Interactions between nearest neighbors are represented\nby springs connecting them. A short and necessary introduction of the lattice\nstructure is presented. The dynamical matrix of the vibrational modes is then\nderived, and its eigenvalue problem is solved analytically. The solution may\nprovide deeper insight into the nature of the vibrational modes. Numerical\nresults for the vibrational frequencies are presented. To show that how\neffective our method used for the case of honeycomb lattice is, we also apply\nit to triangular and square lattice structures. A few suggested problems are\nlisted in the concluding section.\n", "  We present a high-field magnetization study of the $S$ = 1/2\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain [PM Cu(NO$_3$)$_2$(H$_2$O)$_2$]$_n$. For\nthis material, as result of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and a\nstaggered $g$ tensor, the ground state is characterized by an anisotropic\nfield-induced spin excitation gap and a staggered magnetization. Our data\nreveal the qualitatively different behavior in the directions of maximum and\nzero spin excitation gap. The data are analyzed via exact diagonalization of a\nlinear spin chain with up to 20 sites and on basis of the Bethe ansatz\nequations, respectively. For both directions we find very good agreement\nbetween experimental data and theoretical calculations. We extract the magnetic\ncoupling strength $J/k_B$ along the chain direction to 36.3(5) K and determine\nthe field dependence of the staggered magnetization component $m_s$.\n", "  We derive the full counting statistics of charge transfer through a voltage\nbiased superconducting junction. We find that for measurement times much longer\nthan the inverse Josephson frequency, the counting statistics describes a\ncorrelated transfer of quanta of multiple electron charges, each quantum\nassociated with the transfer of a single quasiparticle. An expression for the\nthe counting statistics in terms of the quasiparticle scattering amplitudes is\nderived.\n", "  Pd-metal graphite (Pd-MG) has a layered structure, where each Pd sheet is\nsandwiched between adjacent graphene sheets. DC magnetization and AC magnetic\nsusceptibility of Pd-MG have been measured using a SQUID magnetometer. Pd-MG\nundergoes a superconducting transition at $T_{c}$ ($= 3.63 \\pm 0.04$ K). The\nsuperconductivity occurs in Pd sheets. The relaxation of $M_{ZFC}$ (aging),\nwhich is common to spin glass systems, is also observed below $T_{c}$. The\nrelaxation rate $S(t)$ shows a peak at a characteristic time $t_{cr}$, which is\nlonger than a wait time $t_{w}$. The irreversibility between $\\chi_{ZFC}$ and\n$\\chi_{FC}$ occurs well above $T_{c}$. The susceptibility $\\chi_{FC}$ obeys a\nCurie-Weiss behavior with a negative Curie-Weiss temperature ($-13.1 \\leq\n\\Theta \\leq -5.4$ K). The growth of antiferromagnetic order is limited by the\ndisordered nature of nanographites, forming spin glass-like behavior at low\ntemperatures in graphene sheets.\n", "  The magnetic properties of a quasi two-dimensional superconductor, Sn-metal\ngraphite (MG), are studied using DC and AC magnetic susceptibility. Sn-MG has a\nunique layered structure where Sn metal layer is sandwiched between adjacent\ngraphene sheets. This compound undergoes a superconducting transition at\n$T_{c}$ = 3.75 K at $H$ = 0. The $H$-$T$ diagram of Sn-MG is similar to that of\na quasi two-dimensional superconductors. The phase boundaries of vortex liquid,\nvortex glass, and vortex lattice phase merge into a multicritical point located\nat $T^{*}$ = 3.4 K and $H^{*}$ = 40 Oe. There are two irreversibility lines\ndenoted by $H_{gl}$ (de Almeida-Thouless type) and $H_{gl^{\\prime}}$\n(Gabay-Toulouse type), intersecting at $T_{0}^{\\prime}$= 2.5 K and\n$H_{0}^{\\prime}$ = 160 Oe. The nature of slow dynamic and nonlinearity of the\nvortex glass phase is studied.\n", "  Bismuth-metal graphite (MG) has a unique layered structure where Bi\nnanoparticles are encapsulated between adjacent sheets of nanographites. The\nsuperconductivity below $T_{c}$ (= 2.48 K) is due to Bi nanoparticles. The\nCurie-like susceptibility below 30 K is due to conduction electrons localized\nnear zigzag edges of nanographites. A magnetic-field induced transition from\nmetallic to semiconductor-like phase is observed in the in-plane resistivity\n$\\rho_{a}$ around $H_{c}$ ($\\approx$ 25 kOe) for both $H$$\\perp$$c$ and\n$H$$\\parallel$$c$ ($c$: c axis). A negative magnetoresistance in $\\rho_{a}$ for\n$H$$\\perp$$c$ (0$<H\\leq$3.5 kOe) and a logarithmic divergence in $\\rho_{a}$\nwith decreasing temperature for $H$$\\parallel$$c$ ($H$ $>$ 40 kOe) suggest the\noccurrence of two-dimensional weak localization effect.\n", "  Recent work on stochastic interacting particle systems with two particle\nspecies (or single-species systems with kinematic constraints) has demonstrated\nthe existence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, long-range order and phase\ncoexistence in nonequilibrium steady states, even if translational invariance\nis not broken by defects or open boundaries. If both particle species are\nconserved, the temporal behaviour is largely unexplored, but first results of\ncurrent work on the transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic scale\nyield exact coupled nonlinear hydrodynamic equations and indicate the emergence\nof novel types of shock waves which are collective excitations stabilized by\nthe flow of microscopic fluctuations. We review the basic stationary and\ndynamic properties of these systems, highlighting the role of conservation laws\nand kinetic constraints for the hydrodynamic behaviour, the microscopic origin\nof domain wall (shock) stability and the coarsening dynamics of domains during\nphase separation.\n", "  An amenable, analytical two-state description of the nonlinear population\ndynamics of a noisy bistable system driven by a rectangular subthreshold signal\nis put forward. Explicit expressions for the driven population dynamics, the\ncorrelation function (its coherent and incoherent part), the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) and the Stochastic Resonance (SR) gain are obtained. Within a\nsuitably chosen range of parameter values this reduced description yields\nanomalous SR-gains exceeding unity and, simultaneously, gives rise to a\nnon-monotonic behavior of the SNR vs. the noise strength. The analytical\nresults agree well with those obtained from numerical solutions of the Langevin\nequation.\n", "  Using resonant x-ray scattering to perform diffraction experiments at the U\nM$_{4}$ edge novel reflections of the generic form $<kkk>$ have been observed\nin UAs$_{0.8}$Se$_{0.2}$ where $\\vec{k} = < k00>$, with $k = {1/2}$ reciprocal\nlattice units, is the wave vector of the primary (magnetic) order parameter.\nThe $<kkk>$ reflections, with $10^{-4}$ of the $<k00>$ magnetic intensities,\ncannot be explained on the basis of the primary order parameter within standard\nscattering theory. A full experimental characterisation of these reflections is\npresented including their energy, azimuthal and temperature dependencies. On\nthis basis we establish that the reflections most likely arise from the\nelectric dipole operator involving transitions between the core 3d and\npartially filled $5f$ states. The temperature dependence couples the $<kkk>$\npeak to the triple-$\\vec{k}$ region of the phase diagram: Below $\\sim 50$ K,\nwhere previous studies have suggested a transition to a double-$\\vec{k}$ state,\nthe intensity of the $<kkk>$ is dramatically reduced. Whilst we are unable to\ngive a definite explanation of how these novel reflections appear, this paper\nconcludes with a discussion of possible ideas for these reflections in terms of\nthe coherent superposition of the 3 primary (magnetic) order parameters.\n", "  Low frequency dielectric spectroscopy and thermally stimulated discharge\nmeasurements of charge density wave (CDW) system K$_{0.3}$MoO$_{3}$ are\npresented. Below 80 K two distinct relaxational processes are observed, which\nfreeze at finite temperatures bearing close resemblance to the phenomenology of\nthe dielectric response of glasses. We compare our results to the case of\no-TaS$_{3}$ in which the glass transition on the level of CDW superstructure\nhas been recently reported\\cite{Star02} and discuss the possibility that it is\na universal feature of CDW systems.\n", "  The magnon thermal conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$ of the hole doped\nspin ladders in $\\rm Sr_{14-x}Ca_xCu_{24}O_{41}$ has been investigated at low\ndoping levels $x$. The analysis of $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mag}}$ reveals a strong\ndoping and temperature dependence of the magnon mean free path\n$l_{\\mathrm{mag}}$ which is a local probe for the interaction of magnons with\nthe doped holes in the ladders. In particular, this novel approach to studying\ncharge degrees of freedom via spin excitations shows that charge ordering of\nthe holes in the ladders leads to a freezing out of magnon-hole scattering\nprocesses.\n", "  We study the overdamped motion of a particle in a bistable potential subject\nto the action of a bichromatic force and additive noise, within the context of\nthe vibrational resonance phenomenon. Under appropriate conditions, we obtain\nanalytical expressions for the relevant observables which quantifies this\nphenomenon. The theoretical results are compared with those obtained by the\nnumerical solution of the stochastic differential equation which describes the\ndynamics of the system. The limits of validity of the theoretical approach are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an electron subjected to a uniform electric field\nwithin a tight-binding model with long-range-correlated diagonal disorder. The\nrandom distribution of site energies is assumed to have a power spectrum $S(k)\n\\sim 1/k^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha > 0$. Moura and Lyra [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf\n81}, 3735 (1998)] predicted that this model supports a phase of delocalized\nstates at the band center, separated from localized states by two mobility\nedges, provided $\\alpha > 2$. We find clear signatures of Bloch-like\noscillations of an initial Gaussian wave packet between the two mobility edges\nand determine the bandwidth of extended states, in perfect agreement with the\nzero-field prediction.\n", "  We suggest a simple method for measuring the temperature of ultra-cold gases\nmade of fermions. We show that by using a two-photon Raman probe, it is\npossible to obtain lineshapes which reveal properties of the degenerate sample,\nnotably its temperature $T$. The proposed method could be used with identical\nfermions in different hyperfine states interacting via s-wave scattering or\nidentical fermions in the same hyperfine state via p-wave scattering. We\nillustrate the applicability of the method in realistic conditions for $^6$Li\nprepared in two different hyperfine states. We find that temperatures down to\n0.05 $T_{F}$ can be determined by this {\\it in-situ} method.\n", "  A complex carbide Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C consists of van der Waals (vdw)-bonded\nlayers with a stacking sequence $...$ C-Ta-S-vdw-S-Ta-C- $...$ along the c\naxis. The magnetic properties of this compound have been studied from DC and AC\nmagnetic susceptibility. Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C undergoes successive superconducting\ntransitions of a hierachical nature at $T_{cl} = 3.61 \\pm 0.01$ K\n[$H_{c1}^{(l)}(0) = 28 \\pm 2$ Oe and $H_{c2}^{(l)}(0) = 7.7 \\pm 0.2$ kOe] and\n$T_{cu} = 9.0 \\pm 0.2$ K [$H_{c2}^{(u)}(0) = 6.0 \\pm 0.3$ kOe]. The\nintermediate phase between $T_{cu}$ and $T_{cl}$, where $\\delta \\chi (=\n\\chi_{FC} - \\chi_{ZFC}) \\approx 0$, is an intra-grain superconductive state\noccurring in the Ta-C layers in Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C. The low temperature phase\nbelow $T_{cl}$, where $\\delta \\chi$ clearly appears, is an inter-grain\nsuperconductive state. The magnetic susceptibility at $H$ well above\n$H_{c2}^{(l)}(0)$ is described by a sum of a diamagnetic susceptibility and a\nCurie-like behavior. The latter is due to the localized magnetic moments of\nconduction electrons associated with the Anderson localization effect,\noccurring in the 1T-TaS$_{2}$ type structure in Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C.\n", "  A quantum field theoretic formulation of the dynamics of the Contact Process\non a regular graph of degree z is introduced. A perturbative calculation in\npowers of 1/z of the effective potential for the density of particles phi(t)\nand an instantonic field psi(t) emerging from the quantum formalism is\nperformed. Corrections to the mean-field distribution of densities of particles\nin the out-of-equilibrium stationary state are derived in powers of 1/z.\nResults for typical (e.g. average density) and rare fluctuation (e.g. lifetime\nof the metastable state) properties are in very good agreement with numerical\nsimulations carried out on D-dimensional hypercubic (z=2D) and Cayley lattices.\n", "  We study the Hopfield model on a random graph in scaling regimes where the\naverage number of connections per neuron is a finite number and where the spin\ndynamics is governed by a synchronous execution of the microscopic update rule\n(Little-Hopfield model).We solve this model within replica symmetry and by\nusing bifurcation analysis we prove that the spin-glass/paramagnetic and the\nretrieval/paramagnetictransition lines of our phase diagram are identical to\nthose of sequential dynamics.The first-order retrieval/spin-glass transition\nline follows by direct evaluation of our observables using population dynamics.\nWithin the accuracy of numerical precision and for sufficiently small values of\nthe connectivity parameter we find that this line coincides with the\ncorresponding sequential one. Comparison with simulation experiments shows\nexcellent agreement.\n", "  High filling of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) with C$_{60}$ and\nC$_{70}$ fullerenes in solvent is reported at temperatures as low as 69\n$^{o}$C. A 2 hour long refluxing in n-hexane of the mixture of the fullerene\nand SWCNT results in a high yield of C$_{60}$,C$_{70}$@SWCNT, fullerene peapod,\nmaterial. The peapod filling is characterized by TEM, Raman and electron energy\nloss spectroscopy and X-ray scattering. We applied the method to synthesize the\ntemperature sensitive (N@C$_{60}$:C$_{60}$)@SWCNT as proved by electron spin\nresonance spectroscopy. The solvent prepared peapod samples can be transformed\nto double walled nanotubes enabling a high yield and industrially scalable\nproduction of DWCNT.\n", "  We study the precessing motion of a vortex in a Bose-Einstein condensate of\natomic gases. In addition to the former zero-temperature studies, finite\ntemperature systems are treated within the Popov and semiclassical\napproximations. Precessing vortices are discussed utilizing the rotating frame\nof reference. The relationship between the sign of the lowest excitation energy\nand the direction of precession is discussed in detail.\n", "  We report magnetization measurements on La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4+ delta) single\ncrystals, with 0 < x < 0.5. Glassy behaviour associated with the formation of\nspin-charge stripes, and a separate spin-glass phase at low temperatures were\nobserved. We have also found a `memory effect' in the magnetic field --\ntemperature history, which is found to be suppressed in the low temperature\nspin state of the x = 0.33 crystal.\n", "  We present femtosecond transient absorption measurements on $\\pi$-conjugated\nsupramolecular assemblies in a high pump fluence regime.\nOligo(\\emph{p}-phenylenevinylene) monofunctionalized with\nureido-\\emph{s}-triazine (MOPV) self-assembles into chiral stacks in dodecane\nsolution below 75$^{\\circ}$C at a concentration of $4\\times 10^{-4}$ M. We\nobserve exciton bimolecular annihilation in MOPV stacks at high excitation\nfluence, indicated by the fluence-dependent decay of $1^1$B$_{u}$-exciton\nspectral signatures, and by the sub-linear fluence dependence of time- and\nwavelength-integrated photoluminescence (PL) intensity. These two\ncharacteristics are much less pronounced in MOPV solution where the phase\nequilibrium is shifted significantly away from supramolecular assembly,\nslightly below the transition temperature. A mesoscopic rate-equation model is\napplied to extract the bimolecular annihilation rate constant from the\nexcitation fluence dependence of transient absorption and PL signals. The\nresults demonstrate that the bimolecular annihilation rate is very high with a\nsquare-root dependence in time. The exciton annihilation results from a\ncombination of fast exciton diffusion and resonance energy transfer. The\nsupramolecular nanostructures studied here have electronic properties that are\nintermediate between molecular aggregates and polymeric semiconductors.\n", "  Recently introduced constitutive equations for the rheology of dense,\ndisordered materials are investigated in the context of stick-slip experiments\nin boundary lubrication. The model is based on a generalization of the shear\ntransformation zone (STZ) theory, in which plastic deformation is represented\nby a population of mesoscopic regions which may undergo non affine deformations\nin response to stress. The generalization we study phenomenologically\nincorporates the effects of aging and glassy relaxation. Under experimental\nconditions associated with typical transitions from stick-slip to steady\nsliding and stop start tests, these effects can be dominant, although the full\nSTZ description is necessary to account for more complex, chaotic transitions.\n", "  We have performed magnetoresistance measurements on polyfluorene sandwich\ndevices in weak magnetic fields as a function of applied voltage, device\ntemperature (10K to 300K), film thickness and electrode materials. We observed\neither negative or positive magnetoresistance, dependent mostly on the applied\nvoltage, with a typical magnitude of several percent. The shape of the\nmagnetoresistance curve is characteristic of weak localization and\nantilocalization. Using weak localization theory, we find that the\nphase-breaking length is relatively large even at room temperature, and\nspin-orbit interaction is a function of the applied electric field.\n", "  The quantum XY model shows a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition\nbetween a phase with quasi long-range order and a disordered one, like the\ncorresponding classical model. The effect of the quantum fluctuations is to\nweaken the transition and eventually to destroy it. However, in this respect\nthe mechanism of disappearance of the transition is not yet clear. In this work\nwe address the problem of the quenching of the BKT in the quantum XY model in\nthe region of small temperature and high quantum coupling. In particular, we\nstudy the phase diagram of a 2D Josephson junction array, that is one of the\nbest experimental realizations of a quantum XY model. A genuine BKT transition\nis found up to a threshold value $g^\\star$ of the quantum coupling, beyond\nwhich no phase coherence is established. Slightly below $g^\\star$ the phase\nstiffness shows a reentrant behavior at lowest temperatures, driven by strong\nnonlinear quantum fluctuations. Such a reentrance is removed if the dissipation\neffect of shunt resistors is included.\n", "  We present an inelastic light scattering study of single crystalline\n(La$_{1-y}$Pr$_y$)$_{1-x}$Sr$_{x}$MnO$_3$ ($0\\leq x\\leq0.14$,$y=0$ and\n$x=1/8$,$0\\leq y\\leq0.5$). A giant softening up to 20 - 30 cm$^{-1}$ of the\nMn-O breathing mode has been observed only for the ferromagnetic insulating\n(FMI) samples ($0.11\\leq x \\leq 0.14$) upon cooling below the Curie\ntemperature. With increasing Pr-doping the giant softening is gradually\nsuppressed. This is attributed to a coupling of the breathing mode to orbital\npolarons which are present in the FMI phase.\n", "  We study spin fluctuation (SF) mediated superconductivity (SC) in a\nhalf-filled square lattice Hubbard model with the transfer matrices -t between\nnearest neighbor sites and -t' between a half of next nearest neighbor sites\nneighboring along only one of the <1,1> directions, considering application of\nthis model to organic kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2X compounds. Varying the t'/t value from\n0 to 1, one can interpolate between a square and an equilateral triangular\nlattice, the latter giving frustration to antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled\nspin systems. Within the fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approximation, we\ncalculate chi(q,omega), Tc and the SC order parameter for various model\nparameter values and find that both AF and SC are suppressed as one approaches\nthe frustration geometry or |(t'/t)-1| \\to 0. The SC phase, however, extends\nbeyond the AF phase boundary fairly close to t'/t=1 for realistic U/t values.\nThe order parameter is of x2-y2-type for t'/t<1 and of xy-type for t'/t>1.\n", "  The magnetic properties of thin Pd fcc(001) films with embedded monolayers of\nFe are investigated by means of first principles density functional theory. The\ninduced spin polarization in Pd is calculated and analyzed in terms of quantum\ninterference within the Fe/Pd/Fe bilayer system. An investigation of the\nmagnetic enhancement effects on the spin polarization is carried out and its\nconsequences for the magnetic interlayer coupling are discussed. In contrast to\n{\\it e.g.} the Co/Cu fcc(001) system we find a large effect on the magnetic\ninterlayer coupling due to magnetic enhancement in the spacer material. In the\ncase of a single embedded Fe monolayer we find aninduced Pd magnetization\ndecaying with distance $n$ from the magnetic layer as ~$n^{-\\alpha}$ with\n$\\alpha \\approx 2.4$. For the bilayer system we find a giant magnetic\nenhancement (GME) that oscillates strongly due to interference effects. This\nresults in a strongly modified magnetic interlayer coupling, both in phase and\nmagnitude, which may not be described in the pure\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) picture. No anti-ferromagnetic coupling\nwas found and by comparison with magnetically constrained calculations we show\nthat the overall ferromagnetic coupling can be understood from the strong\npolarization of the Pd spacer.\n", "  We present the first inelastic neutron scattering study of the short\nwavelength dynamics in a phospholipid bilayer. We show that inelastic neutron\nscattering using a triple-axis spectrometer at the high flux reactor of the ILL\nyields the necessary resolution and signal to determine the dynamics of model\nmembranes. The results can quantitatively be compared to recent Molecular\nDynamics simulations. Reflectivity, in-plane correlations and the corresponding\ndynamics can be measured simultaneously to gain a maximum amount of\ninformation. With this method, dispersion relations can be measured with a high\nenergy resolution. Structure and dynamics in phospholipid bilayers, and the\nrelation between them, can be studied on a molecular length scale.\n", "  The oscillating magnetic interlayer coupling of Fe over spacer layers\nconsisting of Cu$_{x}$Pd$_{1-x}$ alloys is investigated by first principles\ndensity functional theory. The amplitude, period and phase of the coupling, as\nwell as the disorder-induced decay, are analyzed in detail and the consistency\nto the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) theory is discussed. For the first\ntime an effect of the Fermi surface nesting strength on the amplitude is\nestablished from first principles calculations. An unexpected variation of the\nphase and disorder-induced decay is obtained and the results are discussed in\nterms of asymptotics.\n", "  We present the results of numerical simulations of an atomistic system\nundergoing plastic shear flow in the athermal, quasistatic limit. The system is\nshown to undergo cascades of local rearrangements, associated with quadrupolar\nenergy fluctuations, which induce system-spanning events organized into lines\nof slip oriented along the Bravais axes of the simulation cell. A finite size\nscaling analysis reveals subextensive scaling of the energy drops and\nparticipation numbers, linear in the length of the simulation cell, in good\nagreement with the observed real-space structure of the plastic events.\n", "  Focusing on the optimization version of the random K-satisfiability problem,\nthe MAX-K-SAT problem, we study the performance of the finite energy version of\nthe Survey Propagation (SP) algorithm. We show that a simple (linear time)\nbacktrack decimation strategy is sufficient to reach configurations well below\nthe lower bound for the dynamic threshold energy and very close to the analytic\nprediction for the optimal ground states. A comparative numerical study on one\nof the most efficient local search procedures is also given.\n", "  The time-differential perturbed-angular-correlation (TDPAC) technique was\napplied to the study of the internal electric-field gradient (EFG) in Eu- and\nHo-sesquioxides in their cubic bixbyite phases. The results, as well as\nprevious characterizations of the EFG at $^{181}$Ta sites in oxides with the\nbixbyite structure, were compared to those obtained in experiments using\n$^{111}$Cd as probe, and to point-charge model and {\\it ab initio} results\ncalculations for the EFG tensor at impurity sites in binary oxides. These\nstudies provide quantitative information about electronic processes and the\nstructural relaxations induced by the presence of impurity probes in the host\nlattices, and confirm the existence of nonionic contributions to the EFG in\nthese systems. Our FP-LAPW calculations show that this nonionic contribution to\nthe EFG is the dominating one, and that it is originated in the population of\n{\\it p} states (5{\\it p} in the case of Cd, 6{\\it p} for Ta).\n", "  The incremental stress-strain relation of dense packings of polygons is\ninvestigated here by using molecular dynamics simulations. The comparison of\nthe simulation results to the continuous theories is performed using explicit\nexpressions for the averaged stress and strain over a representative volume\nelement. The discussion of the incremental response raises two important\nquestions of soil deformation: Is the incrementally non-linear theory\nappropriate to describe the soil mechanical response? Does a purely elastic\nregime exists in the deformation of granular materials?. In both cases our\nanswer will be \"no\". The question of stability is also discussed in terms of\nthe Hill condition of stability for non-associated materials.\n", "  We present the temperature and layer dependent electronic structure of a\n20-layer EuS(100)-film using a combination of first-principles and model\ncalculation, the latter based on the ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice. The\ncalculated thickness-dependent Curie temperature agrees very well with\nexperimental data. The projected 5d-bandstructure is at finite temperatures\nstrongly influenced by damping effects due to spin exchange processes.\nSpin-split unoccupied 5d-surfaces states are found with a Stoner-like\ncollapsing for increasing temperature towards the Curie point and with an\nexponential decay of spectral weight with increasing distance from the surface.\n", "  A series of well-defined hydrophilic and hydrophobic polyelectrolytes of\nvarious chain lengths $N$ and effective charge fractions $f_{eff}$ have been\nadsorbed onto oppositely charged solid surfaces immersed in aqueous solutions.\n\\emph{In situ} high energy X-ray reflectivity has provided the thickness $h$,\nthe electron density and the roughness of the adsorbed layer in its aqueous\nenvironment. In the case of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes, we have found\n$h\\propto N^0 f_{eff}^{-2/3}$, in agreement with a pearl-necklace conformation\nfor the chains induced by a Rayleigh-like instability.\n", "  This paper investigates the dynamics of in the S&P500 index from daily\nreturns for the last 30 years. Using a stochastic geometry technique, each\nS&P500 yearly batch of data is embedded in a subspace that can be accurately\ndescribed by a reduced number of dimensions. Such feature is understood as\nempirical evidence for the presence of a certain amount of structure in the\nmarket. As part of the inquiry into the structure of the market we investigate\nchanges in its volume and shape, and we define new measures for that purpose.\nHaving these measures defined in the space of stocks we analyze the effects of\nsome extreme phenomena on the geometry of the market. We discuss the hypothesis\nthat collective behavior in period of crises reinforces the structure of\ncorrelations between stocks, but that it also may have an opposite effect on\nclustering by similar economic sectors. Comparing the crises of 1987 and 2001,\nwe discuss why the expansion of the ellipsoid describing the geometry of the\ndistances in the market, which occurs in the latter period, is not homogeneous\nthrough sectors. The conclusions from this research identify some of the\nchanges in the structure of the market over the last 30 years.\n", "  The induced electric field $\\vec{E}(\\vec{x})$ during magnetic flux entry in\nsuperconductors with arbitrary cross section $\\Omega$ and general critical\ncurrent law, has been evaluated by integration along the vortex penetration\npaths. Nontrivial flux motion streamlines are obtained from a variational\nstatement of the critical state, which takes the form of an optimization\nproblem on the finite element discretization of $\\Omega$. The generality of the\ntheory allows to deal with physical conditions not considered before. In\nparticular, it is shown that the boundary condition to be used for determining\n$\\vec{E}$ is the knowledge of the locus E=0 within the sample. This is\nemphasized for anisotropic materials in which the electric field is not\nparallel to the surface. Both numerical and analytical evaluations are\npresented for homogeneous materials with different geometries: convex and\nconcave contours, samples with holes, variable curvature contours, and for\nanisotropic samples. In the isotropic case, discontinuities in the electric\ncurrent paths are shown to be related to changing curvature of the sample's\nsurface. Anisotropic samples display the same kind of discontinuities, even for\nconstant surface curvature.\n", "  We present ab initio density functional calculations that show P (Al) dopant\natoms in small hydrogen-terminated Si crystals to be negatively (positively)\ncharged. These signs of the dopant charges are reversed relative to the same\ndopants in bulk Si. We predict this novel reversal of the dopant charge (and\nelectronic character of the doping) to occur at crystal sizes of order 100 Si\natoms. We explain it as a result of competition between fundamental principles\ngoverning charge transfer in bulk semiconductors and molecules and predict it\nto occur in nanocrystals of most semiconductors.\n", "  Atomic diffusion is usually understood as a succession of random, independent\ndisplacements of an adatom over the surface's potential energy landscape.\nNevertheless, an analysis of Molecular Dynamics simulations of self-diffusion\non Cu(111) demonstrates the existence of different types of correlations in the\natomic jumps at all temperatures. Thus, the atomic displacements cannot be\ncorrectly described in terms of a random walk model. This fact has a profound\nimpact on the determination and interpretation of diffusion coefficients.\n", "  It is shown theoretically that the Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma(B)$ in the\nmixed state contains useful information on the gap topology in a\nsuperconductor. We accurately evaluate $\\gamma(B)$ against magnetic induction\n$B$ by using microscopic quasi-classical theory. The linear portion in\n{$\\gamma(\\propto B)$} relative to $B_{\\rm c2}$ and its slope in low field\nfaithfully corresponds to the gap anisotropy, so that we can distinguish the\nnodal gap and the anisotropic full gap, and estimate the magnitude of the gap\nanisotropy.\n", "  We apply the Kovacs experimental protocol to classical and quantum p-spin\nmodels. We show that these models have memory effects as those observed\nexperimentally in super-cooled polymer melts. We discuss our results in\nconnection to other classical models that capture memory effects. We propose\nthat a similar protocol applied to quantum glassy systems might be useful to\nunderstand their dynamics.\n", "  We study the influence of network topology on retrieval properties of\nrecurrent neural networks, using replica techniques for diluted systems. The\ntheory is presented for a network with an arbitrary degree distribution $p(k)$\nand applied to power law distributions $p(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$, i.e. to neural\nnetworks on scale-free graphs. A bifurcation analysis identifies phase\nboundaries between the paramagnetic phase and either a retrieval phase or a\nspin glass phase. Using a population dynamics algorithm, the retrieval overlap\nand spin glass order parameters may be calculated throughout the phase diagram.\nIt is shown that there is an enhancement of the retrieval properties compared\nwith a Poissonian random graph. We compare our findings with simulations.\n", "  Compacted unbound granular materials are extensively used as sub-layer in\npavement design. Most pavement design guides assume that they are responsible\nfor the degradation and deformation of the roads and railways that they\nsupport. Biaxial tests are usually employed to investigate the elasto-plastic\nresponse of these materials to cyclic loading. A particularly interesting\nquestion is whether a limit load exists, below which the excitations shake\ndown, in the sense that the material does not accumulate further deformations.\nWe have carried out a detailed study of the elasto-plastic behavior of a simple\nmodel of unbound granular matter submitted to cyclic loading. The dissipated\nenergy through out the simulation has been used for the characterization of the\ndifferent regimes of responses.\n", "  The Anderson model of a twofold spin degenerate impurity level in the limit\nof infinite Coulomb repulsion, $U \\to \\infty$, coupled to one and two\ndegenerate conduction bands or channels, is considered in pseudo-particle\nrepresentation. We extend the Conserving T-Matrix Approximation (CTMA), a\ngeneral diagrammatic approximation scheme based on a fully renormalized\ncomputation of two-particle vertex functions in the spin and in the charge\nchannel, to the calculation of thermodynamic and spectral properties. In the\nsingle-channel case, the CTMA yields in the Kondo regime a temperature\nindependent Pauli spin susceptibility for temperatures below the Kondo\ntemperature $T_K$ and down to the lowest temperatures considered, reproducing\nthe exact spin screening in the Fermi liquid state. The impurity spectral\ndensity appears to remain non-singular down to the lowest temperatures, in\nagreement with Fermi liquid behavior. However, the unitarity sum rule, which is\ncrucial for an impurity solver like the CTMA to be applicable within Dynamical\nMean Field Theories for strongly correlated lattice models, is overestimated at\nthe lowest temperatures. We argue that this shortcoming may be due to numerical\nimprecision and discuss an appropriate scheme for its correction. In the\ntwo-channel case, the spectral density calculated within CTMA exhibit\nqualitatively the correct non-Fermi liquid behavior at low temperatures, i.e. a\npowerlaw singularity.\n", "  The complex nature of electron-electron correlations is made manifest in the\nvery simple but non-trivial problem of two electrons confined within a sphere.\nThe description of highly non-local correlation and self-interaction effects by\nwidely used local and semi-local exchange-correlation energy density\nfunctionals is shown to be unsatisfactory in most cases. Even the best such\nfunctionals exhibit significant errors in the Kohn-Sham potentials and density\nprofiles.\n", "  We investigate the translocation of a stiff polymer through a nanopore in a\nmembrane, in the presence of binding particles (chaperones) that bind\nreversibly to the polymer on both sides of the membrane. A bound chaperone\ncovers one (univalent binding) or many (multivalent binding) binding sites.\nAssuming that the diffusion of the chaperones is fast compared to the rate of\ntranslocation we describe the process by a one-dimensional master equation. We\nexpand previous models by a detailed study of the effective force in the master\nequation, which is obtained by the appropriate statistical mechanical average\nover the chaperone states. The dependence of the force on the degree of valency\n(the number of binding sites occupied by a chaperone) is studied in detail. We\nobtain finite size corrections (to the thermodynamical expression for the\nforce), which, for univalent binding, can be expressed analytically. We finally\ninvestigate the mean velocity for translocation as a function of chaperone\nbinding strength and size. For both univalent and multivalent binding simple\nresults are obtained for the case of a sufficiently long translocating polymer.\n", "  We show that, in the athermal quasi-static deformation of amorphous\nmaterials, the onset of failure is accompanied by universal scalings associated\nwith a \\emph{divergence} of elastic constants. A normal mode analysis of the\nnon-affine elastic displacement field allows us to clarify its relation to the\nzero-frequency mode at the onset of failure and to the crack-like pattern which\nresults from the subsequent relaxation of energy.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on copper pyrimidine\ndinitrate [CuPM(NO3)2(H2O)2]n, a one-dimensional S = 1/2 antiferromagnet with\nalternating local symmetry. From the local susceptibility measured by NMR at\nthe three inequivalent carbon sites in the pyrimidine molecule we deduce a\ngiant spin canting, i.e., an additional staggered magnetization perpendicular\nto the applied external field at low temperatures. The magnitude of the\ntransverse magnetization, the spin canting of 52 degrees at 10 K and 9.3 T and\nits temperature dependence are in excellent agreement with exact\ndiagonalization calculations.\n", "  The probability P(alpha, N) that search algorithms for random Satisfiability\nproblems successfully find a solution is studied as a function of the ratio\nalpha of constraints per variable and the number N of variables. P is shown to\nbe finite if alpha lies below an algorithm--dependent threshold alpha\\_A, and\nexponentially small in N above. The critical behaviour is universal for all\nalgorithms based on the widely-used unitary propagation rule: P[ (1 + epsilon)\nalpha\\_A, N] ~ exp[-N^(1/6) Phi(epsilon N^(1/3)) ]. Exponents are related to\nthe critical behaviour of random graphs, and the scaling function Phi is\nexactly calculated through a mapping onto a diffusion-and-death problem.\n", "  The energy spectrum of cake shape normal - superconducting systems is\ncalculated by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We take into account\nthe mismatch in the effective masses and Fermi energies of the normal and\nsuperconducting regions as well as the potential barrier at the interface. In\nthe case of a perfect interface and without mismatch, the energy levels are\ntreated by semi-classics. Analytical expressions for the density of states and\nits integral, the step function, are derived and compared with that obtained\nfrom exact numerics. We find a very good agreement between the two\ncalculations. It is shown that the spectrum possesses an energy gap and the\ndensity of states is singular at the edge of the gap. The effect of the\nmismatch and the potential barrier on the gap is also investigated.\n", "  We analyze the itinerant model for antiferromagnetism, which was developed\npreviously by Plischke, Mattis, Brouers and Mizia. In this model we include\nboth; single-site and two-site electron correlations. Including additionally\nband degeneration into the model allows for considering intra-atomic exchange\ninteractions in the Hamiltonian. The modified Hartree-Fock approximation for\nthe two-site interactions is used. This approximation gives the spin band\nnarrowing, which is the same for both spin directions and affects possibility\nof antiferromagnetic ordering. We use the Green function technique and CPA\ndecoupling. This allows for the change in shape of the spin bands, described by\nthe correlation factors, which decreases kinetic energy of the system. The\neffective Hartree field and the gain in kinetic energy due to the on-site and\ninter-site correlation factors drive the antiferromagnetism.\n", "  This is an analysis of the itinerant model for antiferromagnetism, in which\nis included both on-site and inter-site electron correlations. We also consider\nthe band degeneration, which brings into the Hamiltonian the on-site exchange\ninteractions. The Green function technique is used and the coherent potential\napproximation (CPA) decoupling for the on-site Coulomb repulsion. This\ndecoupling combined with the modified Hartree-Fock approximation for the\ninter-site interactions generates the change in shape of the spin bands with\ngrowing interaction constants, which is described by the correlation factors\nand which decreases the kinetic energy of the system. The effective Hartree\nfield and the gain in kinetic energy due to the on-site and inter-site\ncorrelation factors drive the antiferromagnetism. The on-site and inter-site\ninteractions act together towards the antiferromagnetism. Their cooperation\ndecreases the interaction constants required for the antiferromagnetic\nordering. This new approach allows for the antiferromagnetic instability in the\npurely itinerant model at the half-filling in the split band limit. This\nsituation describes the high temperature superconducting cuprates.\n", "  We report on novel antiferromagnetic (AFM) and superconducting (SC)\nproperties of noncentrosymmetric CePt3Si through measurements of the 195Pt\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1. In the normal state, the\ntemperature (T) dependence of 1/T1 unraveled the existence of low-lying levels\nin crystal-electric-field multiplets and the formation of a heavy fermion (HF)\nstate. The coexistence of AFM and SC phases, that emerge at TN = 2.2 K and Tc =\n0.75 K, respectively, takes place on a microscopic level. CePt3Si is the first\nHF superconductor that reveals a peak in 1/T1 just below Tc and, additionally,\ndoes not follow the T^3 law that used to be reported for most unconventional HF\nsuperconductors. We remark that this unexpected SC characteristics may be\nrelated with the lack of an inversion center in its crystal structure.\n", "  A translationally invariant formulation of the Hartree-Fock (HF)\n$\\Gamma$-point approximation is presented. This formulation is achieved through\nintroduction of the Minimum Image Convention (MIC) at the level of primitive\ntwo-electron integrals, and implemented in a periodic version of the ONX\nalgorithm [J. Chem. Phys, {\\bf 106} 9708 (1997)] for linear scaling computation\nof the exchange matrix. Convergence of the HF-MIC $\\Gamma$-point model to the\nHF ${\\bf k}$-space limit is demonstrated for fully periodic magnesium oxide,\nice and diamond. Computation of the diamond lattice constant using the HF-MIC\nmodel together with the hybrid PBE0 density functional [Theochem, {\\bf 493} 145\n(1999)] yields $a_0=3.569$\\AA with the 6-21G* basis set and a $3\\times3\\times3$\nsupercell. Linear scaling computation of the HF-MIC exchange matrix is\ndemonstrated for diamond and ice in the condensed phase\n", "  The grand potential for open systems describes thermodynamics of fluid flows\nat low Mach numbers. A new system of reduced equations for the grand potential\nand the fluid momentum is derived from the compressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are the quasi-stationary\nsolution to the new system. It is argued that the grand canonical ensemble is\nthe unifying concept for the derivation of models and numerical methods for\nincompressible fluids, illustrated here with a simulation of a minimal\nBoltzmann model in a microflow setup.\n", "  We present a method to measure the effective field contribution to\nspin-transfer-induced interactions between the magnetic layers in a trilayer\nnanostructure, which enables spin-current effects to be distinguished from the\nusual charge-current-induced magnetic fields. This technique is demonstrated on\nsubmicron Co/Cu/Co nanopillars. The hysteresis loop of one of the magnetic\nlayers in the trilayer is measured as a function of current while the direction\nof magnetization of the other layer is kept fixed, first in one direction and\nthen in the opposite direction. These measurements show a current-dependent\nshift of the hysteresis loop which, based on the symmetry of the magnetic\nresponse, we associate with spin-transfer. The observed loop-shift with applied\ncurrent at room temperature is reduced in measurements at 4.2 K. We interprete\nthese results both in terms of a spin-current dependent effective activation\nbarrier for magnetization reversal and a spin-current dependent effective\nmagnetic field. From data at 4.2 K we estimate the magnitude of the\nspin-transfer induced effective field to be $\\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-7} $ Oe\ncm$^2$/A, about a factor of 5 less than the spin-transfer torque.\n", "  The effect of an insulating barrier located at a distance $a$ from a NS\nquantum point contact is analyzed in this work. The Bogoliubov de Gennes\nequations are solved for NINS junctions (S: anysotropic superconductor, I:\ninsulator and N: normal metal), where the NIN region is a quantum wire. For $%\na\\neq0$, bound states and resonances in the differential conductance are\npredicted. These resonances depend on the symmetry of the pair potential, the\nstrength of the insulating barrier and $a $. Our results show that in a NINS\nquantum point contact the number of resonances vary with the symmetry of the\norder parameter. This is to be contrasted with the results for the NINS\njunction, in which only the position of the resonances changes with the\nsymmetry.\n", "  A magneto-optically active thin film of Rb$_{j}$Co$_{k}$[Fe(CN)$_{6}$]$_{l}$\n$\\cdot$$n$H$_{2}$O has been prepared using a sequential assembly method. Upon\nirradiation with light and at 5 K, the net magnetization of the film increased\nwhen the surface of the film was oriented parallel to the external magnetic\nfield of 0.1 T. However, when the surface of the film was perpendicular to the\nfield, the net magnetization \\emph{decreased} upon irradiation. The presence of\ndipolar fields and the low-dimensional nature of the system are used to\ndescribe the orientation dependence of the photo-induced magnetization. The\nability to increase or decrease the photo-induced magnetization by changing the\norientation of the system with respect to the field is a new phenomenon that\nmay be useful in future device applications.\n", "  Two different types of directed networks are investigated, transcriptional\nregulation networks and neural networks. The directed network structure are\nstudied and also shown to reflect the different processes taking place on the\nnetworks. The distribution of influence, identified as the the number of\ndownstream vertices, are used as a tool for investigating random vertex\nremoval. In the transcriptional regulation networks we observe that only a\nsmall number of vertices have a large influence. The small influences of most\nvertices limit the effect of a random removal to in most cases only a small\nfraction of vertices in the network. The neural network has a rather different\ntopology with respect to the influence, which are large for most vertices. To\nfurther investigate the effect of vertex removal we simulate the biological\nprocesses taking place on the networks. Opposed to the presumpted large effect\nof random vertex removal in the neural network, the high density of edges in\nconjunction with the dynamics used makes the change in the state of the system\nto be highly localized around the removed vertex.\n", "  We propose a simplified version of self-interaction corrected local\nspin-density (SIC-LSD) approximation, based on multiple scattering theory,\nwhich implements self-interaction correction locally, within the KKR method.\nThe multiple scattering aspect of this new SIC-LSD method allows for the\ndescription of crystal potentials which vary from site to site in a random\nfashion and the calculation of physical quantities averaged over ensembles of\nsuch potentials using the coherent potential approximation (CPA). This\nfacilitates applications of the SIC to alloys and pseudoalloys which could\ndescribe disordered local moment systems, as well as intermediate valences. As\na demonstration of the method, we study the well-known $\\alpha$-$\\gamma$ phase\ntransition in Ce, where we also explain how SIC operates in terms of multiple\nscattering theory.\n", "  We analyze the influence of different on-site and inter-site interactions on\nthe Curie temperature of transition metal magnetic elements. The numerical\ncalculations show the well known result that the on-site Coulomb repulsion\nhelps ferromagnetism mainly at half-filling of the band, where the 3d elements\nare antiferromagnetic (Cr, Mn). The inter-site interactions, which in the new\napproximation decrease the width of the band, favor ferromagnetism at both ends\nof the band. At the same time they lower the ferromagnetic Curie temperature\ntowards experimental values, removing the paradox which persisted for a long\ntime.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility of creating domain walls described by a single\ncomponent Gross-Pitaevskii equation with attractive interaction, in the\npresence of an optical-lattice potential. While it is found that the extended\ndomain wall is unstable, we show that the external magnetic trap can stabilize\nit. Stable solutions include twisted domain walls, as well as asymmetric\nsolitons. The results also apply to spatial solitons in planar waveguides with\ntransverse modulation of the refractive index.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of vortices in repulsive Bose-Einstein\ncondensates in the presence of an optical lattice (OL) and a parabolic magnetic\ntrap. The dynamics is sensitive to the phase of the OL potential relative to\nthe magnetic trap, and depends less on the OL strength. For the cosinusoidal OL\npotential, a local minimum is generated at the trap's center, creating a stable\nequilibrium for the vortex, while in the case of the sinusoidal potential, the\nvortex is expelled from the center, demonstrating spiral motion. Cases where\nthe vortex is created far from the trap's center are also studied, revealing\nslow outward-spiraling drift. Numerical results are explained in an analytical\nform by means of a variational approximation. Finally, motivated by a discrete\nmodel (which is tantamount to the case of the strong OL lattice), we present a\nnovel type of vortex consisting of two pairs of anti-phase solitons.\n", "  In a benchmark dynamical-lattice model in three dimensions, the discrete\nnonlinear Schr{\\\"{o}}dinger equation, we find discrete vortex solitons with\nvarious values of the topological charge $S$. Stability regions for the\nvortices with $S=0,1,3$ are investigated. The S=2 vortex is unstable,\nspontaneously rearranging into a stable one with S=3. In a two-component\nextension of the model, we find a novel class of stable structures, consisting\nof vortices in the different components, perpendicularly oriented to each\nother. Self-localized states of the proposed types can be observed\nexperimentally in Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in optical lattices, and in\nphotonic crystals built of microresonators.\n", "  We present an efficient scheme for representing many-body wavefunctions in\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. The scheme is based on B-splines (blip\nfunctions), which consist of localized cubic splines centred on the points of a\nregular grid. We show that blip functions are unbiased, systematically\nimprovable, and conveniently obtained from any standard plane-waves density\nfunctional theory (PW-DFT) code, and therefore provide a convenient and natural\ninterface between PW-DFT and QMC calculations. We present tests on a 16-atom\nsystem of Si in the $\\beta$-tin structure, and on 2- and 8- atoms systems of\nMgO in the NaCl structure. We show that already with such small systems the\nspeed-up of blip functions with respect to plane-waves is between one and two\norder of magnitudes, without compromising the accuracy.\n", "  We have used diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations to study the\npressure-induced phase transition from the diamond to $\\beta$-tin structure in\nsilicon. The calculations employ the pseudopotential technique and\nsystematically improvable B-spline basis sets. We show that in order to achieve\na precision of 1 GPa in the transition pressure the non-cancelling errors in\nthe energies of the two structures must be reduced to 30 meV/atom. Extensive\ntests on system size errors, non-local pseudopotential errors, basis-set\nincompleteness errors, and other sources of error, performed on periodically\nrepeated systems of up to 432 atoms, show that all these errors together can be\nreduced to well below 30 meV/atom. The calculated DMC transition pressure is\nabout 3-4 GPa higher than the accepted experimental range of values, and we\nargue that the discrepancy may be due to the fixed-node error inherent in DMC\ntechniques.\n", "  The problem of a condensate of a relativistic neutral vector boson gas\nconstituted of particles bearing a magnetic moment is discussed. Such a vector\nboson system is expected to be formed either by parallel spin-pairing of\nneutrons in a sufficiently strong magnetic field, or by neutral atoms under\nspecific conditions of magnetic field strength and density. A strong\nself-magnetization arises due to a Bose-Einstein-like condensation. Then the\nsystem, which may resemble the superfluid said to exist in the core of neutron\nstars, becomes more unstable under transverse collapse than the ordinary\nfermion gas. In the nonrelativistic limit of laboratory conditions, an analogy\nwith the behavior of exploding Bose-Einstein condensates for critical values of\nmagnetic field strength and particle density; reported by several authors, is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  We present Coulomb Blockade measurements of two few-electron quantum dots in\nseries which are configured such that the electrochemical potential of one of\nthe two dots is aligned with spin-selective leads. The charge transfer through\nthe system requires co-tunneling through the second dot which is $not$ in\nresonance with the leads. The observed amplitude modulation of the resulting\ncurrent is found to reflect spin blockade events occurring through either of\nthe two dots. We also confirm that charge redistribution events occurring in\nthe off-resonance dot are detected indirectly via changes in the\nelectrochemical potential of the aligned dot.\n", "  We report on magnetotransport measurements performed on a large metallic\ntwo-dimensional $\\mathcal{T}_{3}$ network. Superimposed on the conventional\nAltshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) oscillations of period $h/2e$, we observe clear\n$h/e$ oscillations in magnetic fields up to $8 T$. Different interpretations of\nthis phenomenon are proposed.\n", "  Current-induced magnetic excitations in Co/Cu/Co bilayer nanopillars\n($\\sim$50 nm in diameter) have been studied experimentally at low temperatures\nfor large applied fields perpendicular to the layers. At sufficiently high\ncurrent densities excitations, which lead to a decrease in differential\nresistance, are observed for both current polarities. Such bipolar excitations\nare not expected in a single domain model of spin-transfer. We propose that at\nhigh current densities strong asymmetries in the longitudinal spin accumulation\ncause spin-wave instabilities transverse to the current direction in bilayer\nsamples, similar to those we have reported for single magnetic layer junctions.\n", "  Scalability and performance of current flash memories can be improved\nsubstantially by replacing the floating poly-Si gate by a layer of Si dots.\nThis multi-dot layer can be fabricated CMOS-compatibly in very thin gate oxide\nby ion beam synthesis (IBS). Here, we present both experimental and theoretical\nstudies on IBS of multi-dot layers consisting of Si nanocrystals (NCs). The NCs\nare produced by ultra low energy Si ion implantation, which causes a high Si\nsupersaturation in the shallow implantation region. During post-implantation\nannealing, this supersaturation leads to phase separation of the excess Si from\nthe SiO2. Till now, the study of this phase separation process suffered from\nthe weak Z contrast between Si and SiO2 in Transmission Electron Microscopy\n(TEM). Here, this imaging problem is resolved by mapping Si plasmon losses with\na Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy equipped with a parallel Electron\nEnergy Loss Spectroscopy system (PEELS-STEM). Additionally, kinetic lattice\nMonte Carlo simulations of Si phase separation have been performed and compared\nwith the experimental Si plasmon maps. It has been predicted theoretically that\nthe morphology of the multi-dot Si floating-gate changes with increasing ion\nfluence from isolated, spherical NCs to percolated spinodal Si pattern. These\npatterns agree remarkably with PEELS-STEM images. However, the predicted\nfluence for spinodal patterns is lower than the experimental one. Because\noxidants of the ambient atmosphere penetrate into the as-implanted SiO2, a\nsubstantial fraction of the implanted Si might be lost due to oxidation.\n", "  We show the possibility of producing matter-wave switching devices by using\nManakov interactions between matter wave solitons in two-species Bose-Einstein\nCondensates (BEC). Our results establish the experimental parameters for three\ninteraction regimes in two-species BECs: symmetric and asymmetric splitting,\ndown-switching and up-switching. We have studied the dependence upon the\ninitial conditions and the kind of interaction between the two components of\nthe BECs.\n", "  The magnetic excitations in the stripe phase of high-T_c superconductors are\ninvestigated in a model of spin ladders which are effectively coupled via\ncharged stripes. Starting from the effective single-triplon model for the\nisolated spin ladder, the quasi-one-dimensional spin system can be described\nstraightforwardly. Very good agreement is obtained with recent neutron\nscattering data on La_(15/8)Ba_(1/8)CuO_4 (no spin gap) and YBa_2Cu_3O_(6.6)\n(gapped). The signature of quasi-one-dimensional spin physics in a\nsingle-domain stripe phase is predicted.\n", "  The pressure-temperature phase diagrams of the heavy fermion antiferromagnet\nCeRhIn$_5$ and the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$ have been studied\nunder hydrostatic pressure by ac calorimetry and ac susceptibility measurements\nusing diamond anvil cells with argon as pressure medium. In CeRhIn$_5$, the use\nof a highly hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium allows for a clean\nsimultaneous determination by a bulk probe of the antiferromagnetic and\nsuperconducting transitions. We compare our new phase diagram with the previous\nones, discuss the nature (first or second order) of the various lines, and the\ncoexistence of antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. The link between\nthe collaps of the superconducting heat anomaly and the broadening of the\nantiferromagnetic transition points to an inhomogeneous appearence of\nsuperconductivity below $P_c \\approx 1.95$ GPa. Homogeneous bulk\nsuperconductivity is only observed above this critical pressure. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the influence of pressure inomogeneities on the specific\nheat anomalies which emphasizes that the observed broadening of the transitions\nnear $P_c$ is connected with the first order transition. For CeCoIn$_5$ we show\nthat the large specific heat anomaly observed at $T_c$ at ambient pressure is\nsuppressed linearly at least up to 3 GPa.\n", "  Hamiltonians for general multi-state spin-glass systems with Ising symmetry\nare derived for both sequential and synchronous updating of the spins. The\npossibly different behaviour caused by the way of updating is studied in detail\nfor the (anti)-ferromagnetic version of the models, which can be solved\nanalytically without any approximation, both thermodynamically via a\nfree-energy calculation and dynamically using the generating functional\napproach. Phase diagrams are discussed and the appearance of two-cycles in the\ncase of synchronous updating is examined. A comparative study is made for the\nQ-Ising and the Blume-Emery-Griffiths ferromagnets and some interesting\nphysical differences are found. Numerical simulations confirm the results\nobtained.\n", "  The open electron resonator, described by Duncan et.al, is a mesoscopic\ndevice that has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable\nbehaviour (conductance oscillations), which has been explained by detailed\ntheories based on the behaviour of electrons at the top of the Fermi sea. In\nthis work, we study the resonator using the simple quantum quantum electrical\ncircuit approach, developed recently by Li and Chen. With this approach, and\nconsidering a very simple capacitor-like model of the system, we are able to\ntheoretically reproduce the observed conductance oscillations. A very\nremarkable feature of the simple theory developed here is the fact that the\npredictions depend mostly on very general facts, namely, the discrete nature of\nelectric charge and quantum mechanics; other detailed features of the systems\ndescribed enter as parameters of the system, such as capacities and\ninductances.\n", "  Single molecule rotational correlation functions are analyzed for several\nreorientation geometries. Even for the simplest model of isotropic rotational\ndiffusion our findings predict non-exponential correlation functions to be\nobserved by polarization sensitive single molecule fluorescence microscopy.\nThis may have a deep impact on interpreting the results of molecular\nreorientation measurements in heterogeneous environments.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the evaporative cooling of a\nmagnetically guided atomic beam by means of discrete radio-frequency antennas.\nFirst we derive the changes in flux and temperature, as well as in collision\nrate and phase-space density, for a single evaporation step. Next we show how\nthe occurrence of collisions during the propagation between two successive\nantennas can be probed. Finally, we discuss the optimization of the evaporation\nramp with several antennas to reach quantum degeneracy. We estimate the number\nof antennas required to increase the phase-space density by several orders of\nmagnitude. We find that at least 30 antennas are needed to gain a factor $10^8$\nin phase-space density.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of a quantum phase transition in ultracold spin\npolarized fermionic gases which exhibit a p-wave Feshbach resonace. We show\nthat when fermionic atoms form a condensate that can be externally tuned\nbetween the BCS and BEC limits, the zero temperature compressibility and the\nspin susceptibility of the fermionic gas are non-analytic functions of the\ntwo-body bound state energy. This non-analyticity is due to a massive\nrearrangement of the momentum distribution in the ground state of the system.\nFurthermore, we show that the low temperature superfluid density is also\nnon-analytic, and exibits a dramatic change in behavior when the critical value\nof the bound state energy is crossed.\n", "  The BCS to BEC evolution has been recently the focus of studies in\nsuperconductors and cold atomic gases. For a d-wave system, we show that a\nLifshitz transition occurs at a critical particle density which separates two\ntopologically distinct phases: a BCS-like gapless superconductor/superfluid in\nthe higher density limit and a BEC-like fully gapped superconductor/superfluid\nin the lower density limit. This transition is second order according to\nEhrenfest's classification, but it occurs without a change in the symmetry of\nthe order parameter, and thus can not be classified under Landau's scheme. To\nillustrate the nature of the transition, we compute the compressibility and the\nsuperfluid density as functions of particle density.\n", "  The electrostatic potential above the Abrikosov vortex lattice, discussed\nearlier by Blatter {\\em et al.} {[}PRL {\\bf 77}, 566 (1996){]}, is evaluated\nwithin the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Unlike previous studies we include the\nsurface dipole. Close to the critical temperature, the surface dipole reduces\nthe electrostatic potential to values below a sensitivity of recent sensors. At\nlow temperatures the surface dipole is less effective and the electrostatic\npotential remains observable as predicted earlier.\n", "  In order to study a possible magnetic proximity effect in magnetite-carbon\nstructures, we have performed magnetization measurements of graphite-magnetite\ncomposites with different mass ratios as well as the measurement of the\nmagnetoresistance of one of them and of the magnetization of a magnetite-carbon\nbilayer. The overall results do not indicate the induction of bulk\nferromagnetism in graphite and disordered carbon structures through their\ncontact with magnetite.\n", "  Band structures for solid rare gases (Ne, Ar) have been calculated using the\nGW approximation. All electron and pseudopotential ab initio calculations were\nperformed using Gaussian orbital basis sets and the dependence of particle-hole\ngaps and electron affinities on basis set and treatment of core electrons is\ninvestigated. All electron GW calculations have a smaller particle-hole gap\nthan pseudopotential GW calculations by up to 0.2 eV. Quasiparticle electron\nand hole excitation energies, valence band widths and electron affinities are\ngenerally in very good agreement with those derived from optical absorption and\nphotoemission measurements.\n", "  Many physical and physiological signals exhibit complex scale-invariant\nfeatures characterized by $1/f$ scaling and long-range power-law correlations,\nsuggesting a possibly common control mechanism. Specifically, it has been\nsuggested that dynamical processes influenced by inputs and feedback on\nmultiple time scales may be sufficient to give rise to $1/f$ scaling and scale\ninvariance. Two examples of physiologic signals that are the output of\nhierarchical, multi-scale physiologic systems under neural control are the\nhuman heartbeat and human gait. Here we show that while both cardiac interbeat\ninterval and gait interstride interval time series under healthy conditions\nhave comparable $1/f$ scaling, they still may belong to different complexity\nclasses. Our analysis of the magnitude series correlations and multifractal\nscaling exponents of the fluctuations in these two signals demonstrates that in\ncontrast with the nonlinear multifractal behavior found in healthy heartbeat\ndynamics, gait time series exhibit less complex, close to monofractal behavior\nand a low degree of nonlinearity. These findings are of interest because they\nunderscore the limitations of traditional two-point correlation methods in\nfully characterizing physiologic and physical dynamics. In addition, these\nresults suggest that different mechanisms of control may be responsible for\nvarying levels of complexity observed in physiological systems under neural\nregulation and in physical systems that possess similar $1/f$ scaling.\n", "  We present a numerical study of sidebranching of a solidifying dendrite by\nmeans of a phase--field model. Special attention is paid to the regions far\nfrom the tip of the dendrite, where linear theories are no longer valid. Two\nregions have been distinguished outside the linear region: a first one in which\nsidebranching is in a competition process and a second one further down where\nbranches behave as independent of each other. The shape of the dendrite and\nintegral parameters characterizing the whole dendrite (contour length and area\nof the dendrite) have been computed and related to the characteristic tip\nradius for both surface tension and kinetic dominated dendrites. Conclusions\nabout the different behaviors observed and comparison with available\nexperiments and theoretical predictions are presented.\n", "  We present a derivation of the sharp-interface limit of a generic fluctuating\nphase-field model for solidification. As a main result, we obtain a\nsharp-interface projection which presents noise terms in both the diffusion\nequation and in the moving boundary conditions. The presented procedure does\nnot rely on the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, and can therefore be applied\nto account for both internal and external fluctuations in either variational or\nnon-variational phase-field formulations. In particular, it can be used to\nintroduce thermodynamical fluctuations in non-variational formulations of the\nphase-field model, which permit to reach better computational efficiency and\nprovide more flexibility for describing some features of specific physical\nsituations. This opens the possibility of performing quantitative phase-field\nsimulations in crystal growth while accounting for the proper fluctuations of\nthe system.\n", "  We study initial transient stages in directional solidification by means of a\nnon-variational phase field model with fluctuations. This model applies for the\nsymmetric solidification of dilute binary solutions and does not invoke\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem to account for the fluctuation statistics. We\ndevote our attention to the transient regime during which concentration\ngradients are building up and fluctuations act to destabilize the interface. To\nthis end, we calculate both the temporally dependent growth rate of each mode\nand the power spectrum of the interface evolving under the effect of\nfluctuations. Quantitative agreement is found when comparing the phase-field\nsimulations with theoretical predictions.\n", "  Raman microspectroscopy was used to characterize amorphous silica plastic\nbehavior. Using a correlation between Raman spectrum and density, a map of the\nlocal residual indentation-induced densification is obtained. The existence of\na densification-induced hardening is also evidenced through a diamond anvil\ncell experiment. Such observations are not accounted for by the previously\nproposed hardening-free pressure-dependent yield criterion based on indentation\ncurves. These results open the way to more accurate description of a\nconstitutive law for amorphous silica.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a large, room temperature magnetoresistance\n(MR) effect in polyfluorene sandwich devices in weak magnetic fields. We\ncharacterize this effect and discuss its dependence on voltage, temperature,\nfilm thickness, electrode materials, and (unintentional) impurity\nconcentration. We usually observed negative MR, but positive MR can also be\nachieved under high applied electric fields. The MR effect reaches up to 10% at\nfields of 10mT at room temperature. The effect shows only a weak temperature\ndependence and is independent of the sign and direction of the magnetic field.\nWe find that the effect is related to the hole current in the devices.\n", "  A second neighbor $t-J+V$ model for the chain subsystem of the\n$Sr\\_{14}Cu\\_{24}O\\_{41}$ has been extracted from ab-initio calculations. This\nmodel does not use periodic approximation but describes the entire chain\nthrough the use of the four-dimensional crystallographic description. Second\nneighbors interactions are found to be of same order than the first neighbors\nones. The computed values of the second neighbors magnetic interaction are\ncoherent with experimental estimations of the intra-dimer magnetic\ninteractions, even if slightly smaller. The reasons of this underestimation are\ndetailed. The computed model allowed us to understand the origin of the chain\ndimerisation and predicts correctly the relative occurrence of dimers and free\nspins. The orbitals respectively supporting the magnetic electrons and the\nholes have been found to be essentially supported by the copper 3d orbitals\n(spins) and the surrounding oxygen $2p$ orbitals (holes), thus giving a strong\nfooting to the existence of Zhang-Rice singlets.\n", "  The possibility of ferromagnetic ordering is revisited in the band model. The\ncoherent potential approximation decoupling has been used for the strong\non-site Coulomb interaction. The driving forces towards the ferromagnetism are\nthe on-site and inter-site molecular fields coming from different Coulomb\ninteractions. Another driving force is the lowering of the kinetic energy with\ngrowing magnetic moment coming from the dependence of the hopping integrals on\noccupation of the neighboring sites involved in hopping. This effect is\ndescribed by the hopping interaction, $\\Delta t$, and by what we call the\nexchange-hopping interaction, $t_{ex}$. The exchange-hopping interaction, which\nis the difference in hopping integrals for different occupation of neighboring\nlattice sites, acts in analogous way to the Hund's magnetic exchange\ninteraction. The results are calculated for semi-elliptic density of states\n(DOS) and for the distorted semi-elliptic DOS with the maximum around the Fermi\nenergy. They show a natural tendency towards the magnetic ordering at the end\nof the 3d row for the DOS with maximum density around the Fermi energy, when\nthe hopping integrals grow with the occupation of the neighboring lattice\nsites.\n", "  We investigate high resolution laser absorption spectroscopy of a single\nInGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dot embedded in a field-effect structure. We\nshow experimentally that the interband optical absorption to the lower Zeeman\nbranch of the singly charged exciton is strongly inhibited due to spin (Pauli)\nblockade of the optical transition. At high magnetic fields the optical\nabsorption to the upper Zeeman branch dominates the absorption spectrum. We\nfind however that the spin blockade is not complete and a 10% leakage remains\nat high magnetic fields. Applying a gate voltage to empty the dot of its\nresident electron turns off the spin blockade. This effect is observed at 1.5 K\nand up to 9 Tesla.\n", "  The discovery of quasicrystals phases and approximants in Al(rich)-Mn system\nhas revived the interest for complex aluminides containing transition-metal\natoms. On one hand, it is now accepted that the Hume-Rothery stabilization\nplays a crucial role. On the other hand, transition-metal atoms have also a\nvery important effect on their stability and their physical properties. In this\npaper, we review studies that unifies the classical Hume-Rothery stabilization\nfor sp electron phases with the virtual bound state model for transition-metal\natoms embedded in the aluminum matrix. These studies lead to a new theory for\n\\\"spd electron phases\\\". It is applied successfully to Al(Si)--transition-metal\nalloys and it gives a coherent picture of their stability and physical\nproperties. These works are based on first-principles calculations of the\nelectronic structure and simplified models, compared to experimental results. A\nmore detailed review article is published in Prog. Mater. Sci. 50 (2005) p.\n679-788.\n", "  X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) is used to study the N\nenvironment in bulk GaN and in GaN{y}As{1-y} epilayers on GaAs (001), for y\n\\~5%. Density-functional optimized structures were used to predict XANES via\nmultiple-scattering theory. We obtain striking agreement for pure GaN. An alloy\nmodel with nitrogen pairs on Ga accurately predicts the threshold energy, the\nwidth of the XANES ``white line'', and features above threshold, for the given\nX-ray polarization. The presence of N-pairs may point to a role for molecular\nN_2 in epitaxial growth kinetics.\n", "  We have investigated the growth by molecular-beam epitaxy of the II-VI\ndiluted magnetic semiconductor (Zn,Mn)Se on As-passivated Si(100) substrates.\nThe growth start has been optimized by using low-temperature epitaxy. Surface\nproperties were assessed by Nomarski and scanning electron microscopy. Optical\nproperties of (Zn,Mn)Se have been studied by photoluminescence and a giant\nZeeman splitting of up to 30 meV has been observed. Our observations indicate a\nhigh crystalline quality of the epitaxial films.\n", "  We study exact results concerning the non-affine displacement fields observed\nby Tanguy et al [Europhys. Lett. {\\bf 57}, 423 (2002), Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 66},\n174205 (2002)] and their contributions to elasticity. A normal mode analysis\npermits us to estimate the dominant contributions to the non-affine corrections\nto elasticity, and relate these corrections to the correlator of a fluctuating\nforce field. We extend this analysis to the visco-elastic dynamical response of\nthe system.\n", "  We study the existence of intraband and interband pairing in the extended two\nband and three-band Hubbard model. It is shown that including interband pairing\nsignificantly increases the superconducting critical temperature in comparison\nwith critical temperature of the intraband pairing. This increase allows for\ndecrease of the nearest-neighbor interaction constant necessary for critical\ntemperature in high temperature superconductors to the realistic values.\n", "  We have studied supercurrent-assisted formation of the resistive state in\nnano-structured Nb and NbN superconducting films after absorption of a single\nphoton. In amorphous narrow NbN strips the probability of the resistive state\nformation has a pronounced spectral cut-off. The corresponding threshold photon\nenergy decreases with the bias current. Analysis of the experimental data in\nthe framework of the generalized hot-spot model suggests that the quantum yield\nfor near-infrared photons increases faster than the photon nergy. Relaxation of\nthe resistive state depends on the photon energy making the phenomenon feasible\nfor the development of energy resolving single-photon detectors.\n", "  We present measurements of the electrical conductance $G$ at room temperature\nof mechanically controllable break junctions (MCBJ) fabricated from Au in\ndifferent solvents (octane, DCM, DMSO, and toluene) and compare with\nmeasurements in air and vacuum. In the high conductance regime $G \\agt\nG_0=2e^2/h$, the environment plays a minor role, as proven by the measured\nconductance histograms, which do not depend on the environment. In contrast,\nthe environment significantly affects the electrical properties in the low\nconductance (tunneling) regime {$G << G_0$}. Here, we observe a systematic and\nreproducible lowering of the tunneling barrier height $\\phi$. At shorter\ndistances, a transition to a strongly suppressed apparent barrier height is\nobserved in octane, providing evidence for the layering of solvent molecules at\nsmall inter-electrodes separations. The presented experimental configuration\noffers interesting perspectives for the electrical characterization of single\nmolecules in a controlled environment.\n", "  On the basis of the nonequilibrium Green's function and nonperturbative\ncanonical transformation for the local electron-phonon interaction (EPI), the\nquantum transport through a single-molecule transistor(SMT) has been\ninvestigated with a particular attention paid to the joint effect of the EPI\nand SMT-lead coupling on the spectral function and conductance. In addition to\nthe usual EPI-induced renormalized effects (such as the red-shift, sharpening,\nand phonon-sidebands of the SMT level), owing to improved disentagling the\nelectron-phonon system, it has been found that, the profile of the spectral\nfunction of the SMT electron is sensitive to lead chemical potentials, thus can\nreadily be manipulated by tuning the bias as well as the SMT-gate voltage. As a\nconsequence, the broken particle-hole symmetry in this system can be clearly\nrecognized through the phonon sidebands in the spectral function. These EPI\neffects also manifest themselves in the nonequilibrium transport properties of\nthe SMT, particularly at low temperature.\n", "  The ground state of neutral and negatively charged excitons confined to a\nsingle self-assembled InGaAs quantum dot is probed in a direct absorption\nexperiment by high resolution laser spectroscopy. We show how the anisotropic\nelectron-hole exchange interaction depends on the exciton charge and\ndemonstrate how the interaction can be switched on and off with a small dc\nvoltage. Furthermore, we report polarization sensitive analysis of the\nexcitonic interband transition in a single quantum dot as a function of charge\nwith and without magnetic field.\n", "  We report a comprehensive investigation of the low-energy properties of\nantiferromagnetic quantum XXZ spin chains with aperiodic couplings. We use an\nadaptation of the Ma-Dasgupta-Hu renormalization-group method to obtain\nanalytical and numerical results for the low-temperature thermodynamics and the\nground-state correlations of chains with couplings following several two-letter\naperiodic sequences, including the quasiperiodic Fibonacci and other\nprecious-mean sequences, as well as sequences inducing strong geometrical\nfluctuations. For a given aperiodic sequence, we argue that in the easy-plane\nanisotropy regime, intermediate between the XX and Heisenberg limits, the\ngeneral scaling form of the thermodynamic properties is essentially given by\nthe exactly-known XX behavior, providing a classification of the effects of\naperiodicity on XXZ chains. We also discuss the nature of the ground-state\nstructures, and their comparison with the random-singlet phase, characteristic\nof random-bond chains.\n", "  We propose that the super-Arrhenius relaxation rates observed in glassy\nmaterials are determined by thermally nucleated rearrangements of increasing\nnumbers of molecules at decreasing temperatures. In our model of this\nmechanism, string-like fluctuations in the neighborhood of shear transformation\nzones (STZ's) provide routes along which rearrangements can propagate, and the\nentropy associated with long enough strings allows the rearrangement energy to\nbe distributed stably in the surrounding material. We further postulate that,\nat low enough temperatures, these fluctuations are localized on the interfaces\nbetween frustration-limited domains. Our result is a modified Vogel-Fulcher\nformula at low temperatures that crosses over to a simple Arrhenius law as the\nglass changes from being solid-like to liquid-like. To achieve agreement with\nexperiment in the crossover region, we need to make what seem to us to be\noverly strong assumptions about the behavior of frustration-limited domains.\n", "  We study the current flow paths between two edges in a random resistor\nnetwork on a $L\\times L$ square lattice. Each resistor has resistance $e^{ax}$,\nwhere $x$ is a uniformly-distributed random variable and $a$ controls the\nbroadness of the distribution. We find (a) the scaled variable $u\\equiv\nL/a^\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is the percolation connectedness exponent, fully\ndetermines the distribution of the current path length $\\ell$ for all values of\n$u$. For $u\\gg 1$, the behavior corresponds to the weak disorder limit and\n$\\ell$ scales as $\\ell\\sim L$, while for $u\\ll 1$, the behavior corresponds to\nthe strong disorder limit with $\\ell\\sim L^{d_{\\scriptsize opt}}$, where\n$d_{\\scriptsize opt} = 1.22\\pm0.01$ is the optimal path exponent. (b) In the\nweak disorder regime, there is a length scale $\\xi\\sim a^\\nu$, below which\nstrong disorder and critical percolation characterize the current path.\n", "  We studied the effects of the incommensurate structural modulations on the\nladder subsystem of the $Sr\\_{14-x}Ca\\_{x}Cu\\_{24}O\\_{41}$ family of compounds\nusing ab-initio explicitly-correlated calculations. From these calculations we\nderived $t-J$ model as a function of the fourth crystallographic coordinate\n$\\tau$ describing the incommensurate modulations. It was found that in the\nhighly calcium-doped system, the on-site orbital energies are strongly\nmodulated along the ladder legs. On the contrary the two sites of the ladder\nrungs are iso-energetic and the holes are thus expected to be delocalized on\nthe rungs. Chain-ladder interactions were also evaluated and found to be very\nnegligible. The ladder superconductivity model for these systems is discussed\nin the light of the present results.\n", "  The Roth's two-pole approximation has been used by the present authors to\nstudy the effects of the hybridization in the superconducting properties of a\nstrongly correlated electron system. The model used is the extended Hubbard\nmodel which includes the $d-p$ hybridization, the $p$-band and a narrow\n$d$-band. The present work is an extension a previous reference [Intern. Journ.\nof Modern Phys. B, Vol. 18 No. 2 (2004) 241]. Nevertheless, some important\ncorrelation functions necessary to estimate the Roth's band shift, are included\ntogether with the temperature $T$ and the Coulomb interaction $U$ to describe\nthe superconductivity. The superconducting order parameter of a cuprate system,\nis obtained following Beenen and Edwards formalism. Here, we investigate in\ndetail the change of the order parameter associated to temperature, Coulomb\ninteraction and Roth's band shift effects on superconductivity. The phase\ndiagram with $T_c$ versus the total occupation numbers $n_T$, shows the\ndifference respect to the previous work.\n", "  We present a very efficient and accurate method to simulate scanning\ntunneling microscopy images and spectra from first-principles density\nfunctional calculations. The wave-functions of the tip and sample are\ncalculated separately on the same footing, and propagated far from the surface\nusing the vacuum Green's function. This allows to express the Bardeen matrix\nelements in terms of convolutions, and to obtain the tunneling current at all\ntip positions and bias voltages in a single calculation. The efficiency of the\nmethod opens the door to real time determination of both tip and surface\ncomposition and structure, by comparing experiments to simulated images for a\nvariety of precomputed tips. Comparison with the experimental topography and\nspectra of the Si(111)-(7x7) surface show a much better agreement with Si than\nwith W tips, implying that the metallic tip is terminated by silicon.\n", "  Effects of anisotropic gap structures on a diamagnetic response are\ninvestigated in order to demonstrate that the field-angle-resolved\nmagnetization ($M_L(\\chi)$) measurement can be used as a spectroscopic method\nto detect gap structures. Our microscopic calculation based on the\nquasiclassical Eilenberger formalism reveals that $M_L(\\chi)$ in a\nsuperconductor with four-fold gap displays a four-fold oscillation reflecting\nthe gap and Fermi surface anisotropies, and the sign of this oscillation\nchanges at a field between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$. As a prototype of\nunconventional superconductors, magnetization data for borocarbides are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The conductivity of $\\alpha$-polyvinylidene fluoride ($\\alpha$-PVDF) is\nobtained from dielectric measurements performed in the frequency domain at\nseveral temperatures. At temperatures above the glass-transition, the\nconductivity can be interpreted as an ionic conductivity, which confirms\nearlier results reported in the literature. Our investigation shows that the\nobserved ionic conductivity is closely related to the amorphous phase of the\npolymer.\n", "  We report on electrical spin injection measurements on MWNTs . We use a\nferromagnetic alloy Pd$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$ with x $\\approx$ 0.7 which allows to\nobtain devices with resistances as low as 5.6 $k\\Omega$ at 300 $K$. The yield\nof device resistances below 100 $k\\Omega$, at 300 $K$, is around 50%. We\nmeasure at 2 $K$ a hysteretic magneto-resistance due to the magnetization\nreversal of the ferromagnetic leads. The relative difference between the\nresistance in the antiparallel (AP) orientation and the parallel (P)\norientation is about 2%.\n", "  The influence of surface tension and size on rounding of cell aggregates are\nstudied using chick embryonic cells and numerical simulations based on the\ncellular Potts model. Our results show exponential relaxation in both cases as\nverified in previous studies using 2D Hydra cell aggregates. The relaxation\ntime decreases with higher surface tension as expected from hydrodynamics laws.\nHowever, it increases faster than linearly with aggregate size. The results\nprovide an additional support to the validity of the cellular Potts model for\nnon-equilibrium situations and indicate that aggregate shape relaxation is not\ngoverned by the hydrodynamics of viscous liquids.\n", "  We consider a nanoscale system consisting of Manganite-ferromagnet and\nCuprate-superconductor multilayers in a spin valve configuration. The\nmagnetization of the bottom Manganite-ferromagnet is pinned by a\nManganite-antiferromagnet. The magnetization of the top Manganite-ferromagnet\nis coupled to the bottom one via indirect exchange through the superconducting\nlayers. We study the behavior of the critical temperature and the\nmagnetoresistance as a function of an externally applied parallel magnetic\nfield, when the number of Cuprate-superconductor layers are changed. There are\ntwo typical behaviors in the case of a few monolayers of the Cuprates: a) For\nsmall magnetic fields, the critical temperature and the magnetoresistance\nchange abruptly when the flipping field of the top Manganite-ferromagnet is\nreached. b) For large magnetic fields, the multilayered system re-enters the\nzero-resistance (superconducting) state after having become resistive (normal).\n", "  To study transport properties of complex networks, we analyze the equivalent\nconductance $G$ between two arbitrarily chosen nodes of random scale-free\nnetworks with degree distribution $P(k)\\sim k^{-\\lambda}$ in which each link\nhas the same unit resistance. We predict a broad range of values of $G$, with a\npower-law tail distribution $\\Phi_{\\rm SF}(G)\\sim G^{-g_G}$, where\n$g_G=2\\lambda -1$, and confirm our predictions by simulations. The power-law\ntail in $\\Phi_{\\rm SF}(G)$ leads to large values of $G$, thereby significantly\nimproving the transport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi\nrandom graphs where the tail of the conductivity distribution decays\nexponentially. Based on a simple physical ``transport backbone'' picture we\nshow that the conductances are well approximated by $ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B)$ for any\npair of nodes $A$ and $B$ with degrees $k_A$ and $k_B$. Thus, a single\nparameter $c$ characterizes transport on scale-free networks.\n", "  The point contact of a tunnel tip approaching towards Ag(111) and Cu(111)\nsurfaces is investigated with a low temperature scanning tunneling microscope.\nA sharp jump-to-contact, random in nature, is observed in the conductance.\nAfter point contact, the tip-apex atom is transferred to the surface,\nindicating that a one-atom contact is formed during the approach. In sharp\ncontrast, the conductance over single silver and copper adatoms exhibits a\nsmooth and reproducible transition from tunneling to contact regime. Numerical\nsimulations show that this is a consequence of the additional dipolar bonding\nbetween the homoepitaxial adatom and the surface atoms.\n", "  We report on a Ni L$_{2,3}$ edges x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study\nin $R$NiO$_3$ perovskites. These compounds exhibit a metal to insulator ($MI$)\ntransition as temperature decreases. The L$_{3}$ edge presents a clear\nsplitting in the insulating state, associated to a less hybridized ground\nstate. Using charge transfer multiplet calculations, we establish the\nimportance of the crystal field and 3d spin-orbit coupling to create a\nmixed-spin ground state. We explain the $MI$ transition in $R$NiO$_3$\nperovskites in terms of modifications in the Ni$^{3+}$ crystal field splitting\nthat induces a spin transition from an essentially low-spin (LS) to a\nmixed-spin state.\n", "  The short-range organization around Ni atoms in orthorhombic $R$NiO$_{3}$\n($R$=Pr,Nd,Eu) perovskites has been studied over a wide temperature range by Ni\nK-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that two\ndifferent Ni sites, with different average Ni-O bond lengths, coexist in those\northorhombic compounds and that important modifications in the Ni nearest\nneighbors environment take place across the metal-insulator transition. We\nreport evidences for the existence of short-range charge-order in the\ninsulating state, as found in the monoclinic compounds. Moreover, our results\nsuggest that the two different Ni sites coexists even in the metallic state.\nThe coexistence of two different Ni sites, independently on the $R$ ion,\nprovides a common ground to describe these compounds and shed new light in the\nunderstanding of the phonon-assisted conduction mechanism and unusual\nantiferromagnetism present in all $R$NiO$_{3}$ compounds.\n", "  We present a semi-analytical treatment of both the elastic and inelastic\ncollisional properties near a p-wave Feshbach resonance. Our model is based on\na simple three channel system that reproduces more elaborate coupled-channel\ncalculations. We stress the main differences between s-wave and p-wave\nscattering. We show in particular that, for elastic and inelastic scattering\nclose to a p-wave Feshbach resonance, resonant processes dominate over the\nlow-energy behaviour.\n", "  We compute the stresses in an elastic medium confined in a vertical column,\nwhen the material is at the Coulomb threshold everywhere at the walls.\nSimulations are performed in 2 dimensions using a spring lattice, and in 3\ndimensions, using Finite Element Method. The results are compared to the\nJanssen model and to experimental results for a granular material. The\nnecessity to consider elastic anisotropy to render qualitatively the\nexperimental findings is discussed.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental observation of long range ferromagnetic\norder at a relatively high temperature of 200K in the Fe-doped ZnGa$_2$O$_4$\nsemiconducting spinel, we propose a possible mechanism for the observed\nferromagnetism in this system. We show, supported by band structure\ncalculations, how a model similar to the double exchange model can be written\ndown for this system and calculate the ground state phase diagram for the two\ncases where Fe is doped either at the tetrahedral position or at the octahedral\nposition. We find that in both cases such a model can account for a stable\nferromagnetic phase in a wide range of parameter space. We also argue that in\nthe limit of high Fe$^{2+}$ concentration at the tetrahedral positions a\ndescription in terms of a two band model is essential. The two $e_g$ orbitals\nand the hopping between them play a crucial role in stabilizing the\nferromagnetic phase in this limit. The case when Fe is doped simultaneously at\nboth the tetrahedral and the octahedral position is also discussed.\n", "  The electronic structure of the monoclinic structure of Fe$_3$O$_4$ is\nstudied using both the local density approximation (LDA) and the LDA+$U$. The\nLDA gives only a small charge disproportionation, thus excluding that the\nstructural distortion should be sufficient to give a charge order. The LDA+$U$\nresults in a charge disproportion along the c-axis in good agreement with the\nexperiment. We also show how the effective $U$ can be calculated within the\naugmented plane wave methods.\n", "  The dipole trap model is able to explain the main properties of the apparent\nmetal-to-insulator transition in gated high mobility Si-inversion layers. Our\nnumerical calculations are compared with previous analytical ones and the\nassumptions of the model are discussed carefully. In general we find a similar\nbehavior but include further details in the calculation. The calculated strong\ndensity dependence of the resistivity is not yet in full agreement with the\nexperiment.\n", "  We have investigated the electrical transport through strained\np-Si/Si_{1-x}Ge_x double-barrier resonant tunnelling diodes. The confinement\nshift for diodes with different well width, the shift due to a central\npotential spike in a well, and magnetotunnelling spectroscopy demonstrate that\nthe first two resonances are due to tunnelling through heavy hole levels,\nwhereas there is no sign of tunnelling through the first light hole state. This\ndemonstrates for the first time the conservation of the total angular momentum\nin valence band resonant tunnelling. It is also shown that conduction through\nlight hole states is possible in many structures due to tunnelling of carriers\nfrom bulk emitter states.\n", "  We determine the structural relaxations around paramagnetic impurities (Ti,\nCr, Fe) in corundum (alpha-Al2O3), by combining x-ray absorption near edge\nstructure (XANES) experiments and ab initio calculations. The structural\nrelaxations are found to be very local. We then show that XANES is sensitive to\nsmall variations in interatomic distances within the coordination shell of the\nabsorbing atom. The experiments were carried out on single crystals of ruby and\nsapphires. Linear dichroic signals are essential to characterize the geometry\nof the impurity site. The calculations were performed within a self-consistent\n``non muffin-tin'' framework, that uses pseudopotentials, plane-wave basis set,\nand the continued fraction for the absorption cross section.\n", "  We analyze the scaling of avalanche precursors in the three dimensional\nrandom fuse model by numerical simulations. We find that both the integrated\nand non-integrated avalanche size distributions are in good agreement with the\nresults of the global load sharing fiber bundle model, which represents the\nmean-field limit of the model.\n", "  New systems are required for optical limiting against broadband laser pulses.\nWe demonstrate that the association of non-linear scattering from single-wall\ncarbon nanotubes (SWNT) and multiphoton absorption (MPA) from organic\nchromophores is a promising approach to extend performances of optical limiters\nover broad spectral and temporal ranges. Such composites display high linear\ntransmission and good neutral colorimetry and are particularly efficient in the\nnanosecond regime due to cumulative effects.\n", "  We used high order harmonics of a femtosecond titanium-doped sapphire system\n(pulse duration 25 fs) to realise Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS)\nmeasurements on diamond. The UPS spectra were measured for harmonics in the\nrange 13 to 27. We also made ab initio calculations of the electronic lifetime\nof conduction electrons in the energy range produced in the UPS experiment.\nSuch calculations show that the lifetime suddenly diminishes when the\nconduction electron energy reaches the plasmon energy, whereas the UPS spectra\nshow evidence in this range of a strong relaxation mechanism with an increased\nproduction of low energy secondary electrons. We propose that in this case the\nelectronic relaxation proceeds in two steps : excitation of a plasmon by the\nhigh energy electron, the latter decaying into individual electron-hole pairs,\nas in the case of metals. This process is observed for the first time in an\ninsulator and, on account of its high efficiency, should be introduced in the\nmodels of laser breakdown under high intensity.\n", "  A transition to Kraichnan ultimate regime of convection has been reported in\nvery high Rayleigh numbers experiments, but not in all of them. These\napparently contradictory results can be explained by a recent phenomenological\nmodel which accounts for the non-ideality of the plate thermal properties\n[Chill\\`{a} et al, Physics of Fluids 16:2452 (2004)]. In this paper, we present\na direct test of this model, using a low conductivity plate. We found an\nunaltered transition, not compatible with the model's predictions.\n", "  Within a lattice model describing a binary mixture with fixed concentrations\nof the species we discuss the relation-ship between the surface tension of the\nmixture and the concentrations.\n", "  The present paper studies, using ab-initio calculations, the influence of the\nincommensurate structural modulations on the low energy physics of the\n$Sr\\_{14-x}Ca\\_xCu\\_{24}O\\_{41}$ oxides. On-site, nearest-neighbor and\nnext-nearest-neighbor effective parameters were computed within a $t-J+V$ model\nbased on the copper magnetic orbitals. The structural modulations appear to be\nthe key degree of freedom, responsible for the low energy properties such as\nthe electron localization, the formation of dimers in the $x=0$ compound or the\nanti-ferromagnetic order in the $x=13.6$ compound.\n", "  We consider p-wave (triplet) pairing of single hyperfine state ultracold\natomic gases trapped in quasi-two-dimensional optical lattices. We find that\nthe critical temperatures in the lattice model is considerably higher and\nexperimentally attainable around half-filling in contrast to the predictions of\ncontinuum model for p-wave superfluids. In tetragonal lattices, we show that\nthe atomic compressibility and spin susceptibility have a peak at low\ntemperatures exactly at the half-filling, but this peak splits into two in the\northorhombic lattices. These peaks reflect the p-wave structure of the order\nparameter for superfluidity and they disappear as the critical temperature is\napproached from below. We also calculate the superfluid density tensor, and\nshow that for the orthorhombic case there is no off-diagonal component, however\nin the tetragonal case an off-diagonal component develops, and becomes a key\nsignature of the exotic p-wave state.\n", "  The low frequency excitations of C60 chains inserted inside single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have been studied by inelastic neutron scattering\n(INS) on a high quality sample of peapods. The comparison of the\nneutron-derived generalized phonon density of states (GDOS) of the peapods\nsample with that of a raw SWNTs allows the vibrational properties of the C60\nchains encapsulated in the hollow core of the SWNTs to be probed. Lattice\ndynamical models are used to calculate the GDOS of chains of monomers, dimers\nand polymers inserted into SWNTs, which are compared to the experimental data.\nThe presence of strong interactions between C60 cages inside the nanotube is\nclearly demonstrated by an excess of mode density in the frequency range around\n10 meV. However, the presence of a quasi-elastic signal indicates that some of\nthe C60\\'s undergo rotational motion. This suggests that peapods are made from\na mixture of C60 monomers and C60 n-mer (dimer, trimer ... polymer) structures.\n", "  A simple illustrative wave function with only three variational parameters is\nsuggested to calculate the binding energy of negatively charged excitons (X-)\nas a function of quantum well width. The results of calculations are in\nagreement with experimental data for GaAs, CdTe and ZnSe quantum wells, which\ndiffer considerably in exciton and trion binding energy. The normalized X-\nbinding energy is found to be nearly independent of electron-to-hole mass ratio\nfor any quantum well heterostructure with conventional parameters. Its\ndependence on quantum well width follows an universal curve. The curve is\ndescribed by a simple phenomenological equation.\n", "  We performed a detailed study of the training effect in exchange biased\nCoO/Co bilayers. High-resolution measurements of the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (AMR) are consistent with nucleation of magnetic domains in\nthe antiferromagnetic CoO layer during the first magnetization reversal. This\naccounts for the enhanced spin rotation observed in the ferromagnetic Co layer\nfor all subsequent reversals. Surprisingly, the AMR measurements as well as\nmagnetization measurements reveal that it is possible to partially reinduce the\nuntrained state by performing a hysteresis measurement with an in plane\nexternal field perpendicular to the cooling field. Indeed, the next hysteresis\nloop obtained in a field parallel to the cooling field resembles the initial\nasymmetric hysteresis loop, but with a reduced amount of spin rotation\noccurring at the first coercive field. This implies that the antiferromagnetic\ndomains, which are created during the first reversal after cooling, can be\npartially erased.\n", "  We report diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations on MgO in the rock-salt\nand CsCl structures. The calculations are based on Hartree-Fock\npseudopotentials, with the single-particle orbitals entering the correlated\nwave function being represented by a systematically convergeable cubic-spline\nbasis. Systematic tests are presented on system-size errors using periodically\nrepeating cells of up to over 600 atoms. The equilibrium lattice parameter of\nthe rock-salt structure obtained within DMC is almost identical to the\nHartree-Fock result, which is close to the experimental value. The DMC result\nfor the bulk modulus is also in good agreement with the experimental value. The\nB1-B2 transition pressure (between the rock-salt and CsCl structures) is\npredicted to be just below 600 GPa, which is beyond the experimentally\naccessible range, in accord with other predictions based on Hartree-Fock and\ndensity functional theories.\n", "  We analyze the physics of Bose-Einstein condensates confined in 2D\nquasi-periodic optical lattices, which offer an intermediate situation between\nordered and disordered systems. First, we analyze the time-of-flight\ninterference pattern that reveals quasi-periodic long-range order. Second, we\ndemonstrate localization effects associated with quasi-disorder as well as\nquasiperiodic Bloch oscillations associated with the extended nature of the\nwavefunction of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical quasicrystal. In\naddition, we discuss in detail the crossover between diffusive and localized\nregimes when the quasi-periodic potential is switched on, as well as the\neffects of interactions.\n", "  We study the evolution of a Mott-Hubbard insulator into a correlated metal\nupon doping in the two-dimensional Hubbard model using the Cellular Dynamical\nMean Field Theory. Short-range spin correlations create two additional bands\napart from the familiar Hubbard bands in the spectral function. Even a tiny\ndoping into this insulator causes a jump of the Fermi energy to one of these\nadditional bands and an immediate momentum dependent suppression of the\nspectral weight at this Fermi energy. The pseudogap is closely tied to the\nexistence of these bands. This suggests a strong-coupling mechanism that arises\nfrom short-range spin correlations and large scattering rates for the pseudogap\nphenomenon seen in several cuprates.\n", "  In higher Landau levels ($N>1$), the ground state of the two-dimensional\nelectron gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field evolves from a Wigner\ncrystal for small filling $\\nu $ of the partially filled Landau level, into a\nsuccession of bubble states with increasing number of guiding centers per\nbubble as $\\nu $ increases, to a modulated stripe state near $\\nu =0.5$. In\nthis work, we compute the frequency-dependent longitudinal conductivity $%\n\\sigma_{xx}(\\omega) $ of the Wigner and bubble crystal states in the presence\nof disorder. We apply an elastic theory to the crystal states which is\ncharacterized by a shear and a bulk modulus. We obtain both moduli from the\nmicroscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock approximation. We then use the replica\nand Gaussian variational methods to handle the effects of disorder. Within the\nsemiclassical approximation we get the dynamical conductivity as well as the\npinning frequency as functions of the Landau level filling factor and compare\nour results with recent microwave experiments.\n", "  Using high-speed video and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we study the\nmotion of a large sphere in a vertically vibrated bed of smaller grains. As\npreviously reported we find a non-monotonic density dependence of the rise and\nsink time of the large sphere. We find that this density dependence is solely\ndue to air drag. We investigate in detail how the motion of the intruder sphere\nis influenced by size of the background particles, initial vertical position in\nthe bed, ambient pressure and convection. We explain our results in the\nframework of a simple model and find quantitative agreement in key aspects with\nnumerical simulations to the model equations.\n", "  We study switching current statistics in different moderately damped\nJosephson junctions: a paradoxical collapse of the thermal activation with\nincreasing temperature is reported and explained by interplay of two\nconflicting consequences of thermal fluctuations, which can both assist in\npremature escape and help in retrapping back into the stationary state. We\nanalyze the influence of dissipation on the thermal escape by tuning the\ndamping parameter with a gate voltage, magnetic field, temperature and an\nin-situ capacitor.\n", "  The energetics of point defects in oxide materials plays a major role in\ndetermining their high-temperature properties, but experimental measurements\nare difficult, and calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) are\nnot necessarily reliable. We report quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations of\nthe formation energy $E_{\\rm S}$ of Schottky defects in MgO, which demonstrate\nthe feasibility of using this approach to overcome the deficiencies of DFT. In\norder to investigate system-size errors, we also report DFT calculations of\n$E_{\\rm S}$ on repeating cells of up to $\\sim 1000$ atoms, which indicate that\nQMC calculations on systems of only 54 atoms should yield high precision. The\nDFT calculations also provide the relaxed structures used in the variational\nand diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. For MgO, we find $E_{\\rm S}$ to be in\nclose agreement with results from DFT and from model interaction potentials,\nand consistent with the scattered experimental values. The prospects for\napplying the same approach to transition metal oxides such as FeO are\nindicated.\n", "  Polypeptide-based diblock copolymers forming either well-defined\nself-assembled micelles or vesicles after direct dissolution in water or in\ndichloromethane, have been studied combining light and neutron scattering with\nelectron microscopy experiments. The size of these structures could be\nreversibly manipulated as a function of environmental changes such as pH and\nionic strength in water. Compared to other pH-responsive seld-assembled systems\nbased on \"classical\" polyelectrolytes, these polypeptide-based nanostructures\npresent the ability to give a response in highly salted media as the chain\nconformational ordering can be controlled. This makes these micelles and\nvesicles suitable for biological applications: they provide significant\nadvantages in the control of the structure and function of supramolecular\nself-assemblies.\n", "  We report on experiments to measure the temporal and spatial evolution of\npacking arrangements of anisotropic and weakly confined granular material,\nusing high-resolution $\\gamma$-ray adsorption. In these experiments, the\nparticle configurations start from an initially disordered,\nlow-packing-fraction state and under vertical solicitations evolve to a dense\nstate. We find that the packing fraction evolution is slowed by the grain\nanisotropy but, as for spherically shaped grains, can be well fitted by a\nstretched exponential. For a given type of grains, the characteristic times of\nrelaxation and of convection are found to be of the same order of magnitude. On\nthe contrary compaction mechanisms in the media strongly depend on the grain\nanisotropy.\n", "  We show that correlated dynamics and long time memory persist in\nself-organized criticality (SOC) systems even when forced away from the defined\ncritical point that exists at vanishing drive strength. These temporal\ncorrelations are found for all levels of external forcing as long as the system\nis not overdriven. They arise from the same physical mechanism that produces\nthe temporal correlations found at the vanishing drive limit, namely the memory\nof past events stored in the system profile. The existence of these\ncorrelations contradicts the notion that a SOC time series is simply a random\nsuperposition of events with sizes distributed as a power law, as has been\nsuggested by previous studies.\n", "  With the help of the Green function technique and the equation of motion\napproach, the electronic transport through a parallel-coupled double quantum\ndot(DQD) is theoretically studied. Owing to the inter-dot coupling, the bonding\nand antibonding states of the artificial quantum-dot-molecule may constitute an\nappropriate basis set. Based on this picture, the Fano interference in the\nconductance spectra of the DQD system is readily explained. The possibility of\nmanipulating the Fano lineshape in the tunnelling spectra of the DQD system is\nexplored by tuning the dot-lead coupling, the inter-dot coupling, the magnetic\nflux threading the ring connecting dots and leads, and the flux difference\nbetween two sub-rings. It has been found that by making use of various tuning,\nthe direction of the asymmetric tail of Fano lineshape may be flipped by\nexternal fields, and the continuous conductance spectra may be magnetically\nmanipulated with lineshape retained. More importantly, by adjusting the\nmagnetic flux, the function of two molecular states can be exchanged, giving\nrise to a swap effect, which might play a role as a qubit in the quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the x-ray scattering in the region below the\nfirst sharp diffraction peak was measured for silica glasses with low and high\nOH content (GE-124 and Corning 7980). Data were obtained upon scanning the\ntemperature at 10, 40 and 80 K/min between 400 K and 1820 K. The measurements\nresolve, for the first time, the hysteresis between heating and cooling through\nthe glass transition for silica glass, and the data have a better signal to\nnoise ratio than previous light scattering and differential thermal analysis\ndata. For the glass with the higher hydroxyl concentration the glass transition\nis broader and at a lower temperature. Fits of the data to the\nAdam-Gibbs-Fulcher equation provide updated kinetic parameters for this very\nstrong glass. The temperature derivative of the observed X-ray scattering\nmatches that of light scattering to within 14%.\n", "  We report on Raman scattering measurements of single crystalline\nLa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$MnO$_3$ ($x$=0, 0.06, 0.09 and 0.125), focusing on the high\nfrequency regime. We observe multi-phonon scattering processes up to\nfourth-order which show distinct features: (i) anomalies in peak energy and its\nrelative intensity and (ii) a pronounced temperature-, polarization-, and\ndoping-dependence. These features suggest a mixed orbiton-phonon nature of the\nobserved multi-phonon Raman spectra.\n", "  Precipitation kinetics of Al3Zr and Al3Sc in aluminum supersaturated solid\nsolutions is studied using cluster dynamics, a mesoscopic modeling technique\nwhich describes the various stages of homogeneous precipitation by a single set\nof rate equations. The only parameters needed are the interface free energy and\nthe diffusion coefficient which are deduced from an atomic model previously\ndeveloped to study the same alloys. A comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations based on the vacancy diffusion mechanism shows that cluster\ndynamics correctly predicts the precipitation kinetics provided a size\ndependent interface free energy is used. It also manages to reproduce\nreasonably well existing experimental data.\n", "  Although not an intrinsic superconductor, it has been long--known that, when\nintercalated with certain dopants, graphite is capable of exhibiting\nsuperconductivity. Of the family of graphite--based materials which are known\nto superconduct, perhaps the most well--studied are the alkali metal--graphite\nintercalation compounds (GIC) and, of these, the most easily fabricated is the\nC${}_8$K system which exhibits a transition temperature $\\bm{T_c\\simeq 0.14}\n$K. By increasing the alkali metal concentration (through high pressure\nfabrication techniques), the transition temperature has been shown to increase\nto as much as $\\bm 5 $K in C${}_2$Na. Lately, in an important recent\ndevelopment, Weller \\emph{et al.} have shown that, at ambient conditions, the\nintercalated compounds \\cyb and \\cca exhibit superconductivity with transition\ntemperatures $\\bm{T_c\\simeq 6.5} $K and $\\bm{11.5} $K respectively, in excess\nof that presently reported for other graphite--based compounds. We explore the\narchitecture of the states near the Fermi level and identify characteristics of\nthe electronic band structure generic to GICs. As expected, we find that charge\ntransfer from the intercalant atoms to the graphene sheets results in the\noccupation of the $\\bm\\pi$--bands. Yet, remarkably, in all those -- and only\nthose -- compounds that superconduct, we find that an interlayer state, which\nis well separated from the carbon sheets, also becomes occupied. We show that\nthe energy of the interlayer band is controlled by a combination of its\noccupancy and the separation between the carbon layers.\n", "  We have studied the origin of switching (telegraph) noise at low temperature\nin lateral quantum structures defined electrostatically in GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructures by surface gates. The noise was measured by monitoring the\nconductance fluctuations around $e^2/h$ on the first step of a quantum point\ncontact at around 1.2 K. Cooling with a positive bias on the gates dramatically\nreduces this noise, while an asymmetric bias exacerbates it. We propose a model\nin which the noise originates from a leakage current of electrons that tunnel\nthrough the Schottky barrier under the gate into the doped layer. The key to\nreducing noise is to keep this barrier opaque under experimental conditions.\nBias cooling reduces the density of ionized donors, which builds in an\neffective negative gate voltage. A smaller negative bias is therefore needed to\nreach the desired operating point. This suppresses tunnelling from the gate and\nhence the noise. The reduction in the density of ionized donors also\nstrengthens the barrier to tunneling at a given applied voltage. Support for\nthe model comes from our direct observation of the leakage current into a\nclosed quantum dot, around $10^{-20} \\mathrm{A}$ for this device. The current\nwas detected by a neighboring quantum point contact, which showed monotonic\nsteps in time associated with the tunneling of single electrons into the dot.\nIf asymmetric gate voltages are applied, our model suggests that the noise will\nincrease as a consequence of the more negative gate voltage applied to one of\nthe gates to maintain the same device conductance. We observe exactly this\nbehaviour in our experiments.\n", "  A vortex line is shaped by a zigzag of pinning centers and we study here how\nfar the stretched vortex line is able to follow this path. The pinning center\nis described by an insulating sphere of coherence length size such that in its\nsurface the de Gennes boundary condition applies. We calculate the free energy\ndensity of this system in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory and study\nthe critical displacement beyond which the vortex line is detached from the\npinning center.\n", "  We numerically investigate the critical behavior of the synchronization\ntransition of two unidirectionally coupled delayed chaotic systems. We map the\nproblem to a spatially extended system to show that the synchronization\ntransition in delayed systems exhibits universal critical properties. We find\nthat the synchronization transition is absorbing and generically belongs to the\nuniversality class of the bounded Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, as occurs in\nthe case of extended systems. We also argue that directed percolation critical\nbehavior may emerge for systems with strong nonlinearities\n", "  We present a quantum description of a planar microcavity photon mode strongly\ncoupled to a semiconductor intersubband transition in presence of a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas. We show that, in this kind of system, the vacuum\nRabi frequency $\\Omega\\_R$ can be a significant fraction of the intersubband\ntransition frequency $\\omega\\_{12}$. This regime of ultra-strong light-matter\ncoupling is enhanced for long wavelength transitions, because for a given\ndoping density, effective mass and number of quantum wells, the ratio\n$\\Omega\\_R/\\omega\\_{12}$ increases as the square root of the intersubband\nemission wavelength. We characterize the quantum properties of the ground state\n(a two-mode squeezed vacuum), which can be tuned {\\it in-situ} by changing the\nvalue of $\\Omega\\_R$, e.g., through an electrostatic gate. We finally point out\nhow the tunability of the polariton quantum vacuum can be exploited to generate\ncorrelated photon pairs out of the vacuum via quantum electrodynamics phenomena\nreminiscent of the dynamic Casimir effect.\n", "  We use a conformal mapping technique to study the Laplacian transfer across a\nrough interface. Natural Dirichlet or Von Neumann boundary condition are simply\nread by the conformal map. Mixed boundary condition, albeit being more complex\ncan be efficiently treated in the conformal plane. We show in particular that\nan expansion of the potential on a basis of evanescent waves in the conformal\nplane allows to write a well-conditioned 1D linear system. These general\nprinciple are illustrated by numerical results on rough interfaces.\n", "  Hydrogenation and posthydrogenation annealings have been used as a very\nefficient tool to tune the hole density over a wide range, at fixed magnetic\nmoment concentration, in thin GaMnAs layers. Reduction of the hole density\nresulted in strong modifications of their ferromagnetic properties. In\nparticular, we observed in magnetotransport experiments the decrease of the\nCurie temperature, along with modifications of the magnetic anisotropy, a\nbehavior consistent with the mean-field theory.\n", "  We have recently argued that manganites do not possess stripes of charge\norder, implying that the electron-lattice coupling is weak [Phys Rev Lett\n\\textbf{94} (2005) 097202]. Here we independently argue the same conclusion\nbased on transmission electron microscopy measurements of a nanopatterned\nepitaxial film of La$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$. In strain relaxed regions, the\nsuperlattice period is modified by 2-3% with respect to the parent lattice,\nsuggesting that the two are not strongly tied.\n", "  The joint effect of the electron-phonon interaction and Kondo effect on the\nnonequilibrium transport through the single molecule transistor is investigated\nby using the improved canonical transformation scheme and extended equation of\nmotion approach. Two types of Kondo phonon-satellites with different asymmetric\nshapes are fully confirmed in the spectral function, and are related to the\nelectron spin singlet or hole spin singlet, respectively. Moreover, when a\nmoderate Zeeman splitting is caused by a local magnetic field, the Kondo\nsatellites in the spin resolved spectral function are found disappeared on one\nside of the main peak, which is opposite for different spin component. All\nthese peculiar signatures that manifest themselves in the nonlinear\ndifferential conductance, are explained with a clear physics picture.\n", "  Flexible chains (linear or branched) can be forced to enter into a narrow\ncapillary by using a hydrodynamic flow. Here, we correct our earlier\ndescription of this problem by considering the progressive nature of the\nsuction process. We find that the critical current for penetration, $J\\_c$, is\ncontrolled by the entry of a single blob of the capillary size, and that its\nscaling structure is the same for branched and linear chains.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the formation of a vortex lattice in a\nsuperfluid two-spin component Fermi gas in a rotating harmonic trap, in a\nBCS-type regime of condensed non-bosonic pairs. Our analytical solution of the\nsuperfluid hydrodynamic equations, both for the 2D BCS equation of state and\nfor the 3D unitary quantum gas, predicts that the vortex free gas is subject to\na dynamic instability for fast enough rotation. With a numerical solution of\nthe full time dependent BCS equations in a 2D model, we confirm the existence\nof this dynamic instability and we show that it leads to the formation of a\nregular pattern of quantum vortices in the gas.\n", "  The dynamics of quasicrystal growth remains an unsolved problem in condensed\nmatter. By means of synchrotron live imaging, facetted growth proceeding by the\ntangential motion of ledges at the solid-melt interface is clearly evidenced\nall along the solidification of icosahedral AlPdMn quasicrystals. The effect of\ninterface kinetics is significant so that nucleation and free growth of new\nfacetted grains occur in the melt when the solidification rate is increased.\nThe evolution of these grains is explained in details, which reveals the\ncrucial role of aluminum rejection, both in the poisoning of grain growth and\ndriving fluid flow.\n", "  Following the recent discovery of large magnetoresistance at room temperature\nin polyfluorence sandwich devices, we have performed a comprehensive\nmagnetoresistance study on a set of organic semiconductor sandwich devices made\nfrom different pi-conjugated polymers and small molecules. The measurements\nwere performed at different temperatures, ranging from 10K to 300K, and at\nmagnetic fields, $B < 100mT$. We observed large negative or positive\nmagnetoresistance (up to 10% at 300K and 10mT) depending on material and device\noperating conditions. We compare the results obtained in devices made from\ndifferent materials with the goal of providing a comprehensive picture of the\nexperimental data. We discuss our results in the framework of known\nmagnetoresistance mechanisms and find that none of the existing models can\nexplain our results.\n", "  The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics of self assembled\nmonolayers of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) chemisorbed on the\nnative oxide surface of p+-doped Si demonstrate the excellent tunnel dielectric\nbehavior of organic monolayers down to 3 carbon atoms. The J-V characteristics\nof MPTMS SAMs on Si are found to be asymmetric, and the direction of\nrectification has been found to depend upon the applied voltage range. At\nvoltages < 2.45V, the reverse bias current was found to be higher than forward\nbias current; while at higher voltages this trend was reversed. This result is\nin agreement with Simmons theory. The tunnel barrier heights for this short\nchain (2.56 and 2.14 eV respectively at Au and Si interfaces) are in good\nagreement with the ones for longer chains (>10 carbon atoms) if the chain is\nchemisorbed at the electrodes. These results extend all previous experiments on\nsuch molecular tunnel dielectrics down to 3 carbon atoms. This suggests that\nthese molecular monolayers, having good tunnel behavior (up to 2.5 eV) over a\nlarge bias range, can be used as gate dielectric well below the limits of\nSi-based dielectrics.\n", "  Exciton spin relaxation is investigated in single epitaxially grown\nsemiconductor quantum dots in order to test the expected spin relaxation\nquenching in this system. We study the polarization anisotropy of the\nphotoluminescence signal emitted by isolated quantum dots under steady-state or\npulsed non-resonant excitation. We find that the longitudinal exciton spin\nrelaxation time is strikingly short ($\\leq$100 ps) even at low temperature.\nThis result breaks down the picture of a frozen exciton spin in quantum dots.\n", "  The influence of magnetic anisotropy on nanosecond magnetization reversal in\ncoupled FeNi/Cu/Co trilayers was studied using a photoelectron emission\nmicroscope combined with x-ray magnetic circular dicroism. In quasi-isotropic\nsamples the reversal of the soft FeNi layer is determined by domain wall\npinning that leads to the formation of small and irregular domains. In samples\nwith uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, the domains are larger and the influence of\nlocal interlayer coupling dominates the domain structure and the reversal of\nthe FeNi layer.\n", "  The non-dispersed soft x-ray emission from a La/B4C periodic multilayer\nirradiated by monochromatic x-rays has been measured as a function of the\nincident photon energy in the 125-200 eV range for different scattering angles.\nWe have observed a scattered intensity peak at incident energies which shift\ntowards the low-energy side as the value of the scattering angle increases.\nThese observations are interpreted as Raman scattering by the 5p level of\nlanthanum assisted by Bragg diffraction from the lattice of the periodic\nmultilayer. A simple model based upon the laws of energy and momentum\nconservation enables us to account for the variation of the incident energy\nassociated with the Bragg-Raman peak.\n", "  We discuss the effective interactions between two localized perturbations in\none-dimensional (1D) quantum liquids. For non-interacting fermions, the\ninteractions exhibit Friedel oscillations, giving rise to a RKKY-type\ninteraction familiar from impurity spins in metals. In the interacting case, at\nlow energies, a Luttinger liquid description applies. In the case of repulsive\nfermions, the Friedel oscillations of the interacting system are replaced, at\nlong distances, by a universal Casimir-type interaction which depends only on\nthe sound velocity and decays inversely with the separation. The Casimir-type\ninteraction between localized perturbations embedded in a fermionic environment\ngives rise to a long range coupling between quantum dots in ultracold Fermi\ngases, opening a novel alternative to couple qubits with neutral atoms. We also\nbriefly discuss the case of bosonic quantum liquids in which the interaction\nbetween weak impurities turns out to be short ranged, decaying exponentially on\nthe scale of the healing length.\n", "  The static critical exponents of the three dimensional Blume-Capel model\nwhich has a tricritical point at}$D/J=2.82${\\small value are estimated for the\nstandard and the cooling algorithms which improved from Creutz Cellular\nAutomaton. The analysis of the data using the finite-size scaling and power law\nrelations reproduce their well-established values in the}$D/J<3${\\small and\n}$D/J<2.8${\\small parameter region at standard and cooling algorithm,\nrespectively. For the cooling algorithm at}$D/J=2.8$% {\\small value of\nsingle-ion anisotropy parameter, the static critical exponents are estimated\nas}$\\beta =0.31${\\small ,}$\\gamma =\\gamma ^{\\prime}=1.6${\\small ,}$\\alpha\n=\\alpha ^{\\prime}=0.32${\\small and}$\\nu =0.87$% {\\small . These values are\ndifferent from}$\\beta =0.31${\\small ,}$\\gamma =\\gamma ^{\\prime}=1.25${\\small\n,}$\\alpha =\\alpha ^{\\prime}=0.12${\\small and}$\\nu =0.64${\\small universal\nvalues. This case indicated that the BC model exhibit an ununiversal critical\nbehavior at the}$D/J=2.8${\\small parameter value near the tricrital\npoint(}$D/J=2.82${\\small). The simulations carried out on a simple cubic\nlattice with periodic boundary conditions.\n", "  The existence of a very special ratcheting regime has recently been reported\nin a granular packing subjected to cyclic loading \\cite{alonso04}. In this\nstate, the system accumulates a small permanent deformation after each cycle.\nAfter a short transient regime, the value of this permanent strain accumulation\nbecomes independent on the number of cycles. We show that a characterization of\nthe material response in this peculiar state is possible in terms of three\nsimple macroscopic variables. They are defined that, they can be easily\nmeasured both in the experiments and in the simulations. We have carried out a\nthorough investigation of the micro- and macro-mechanical factors affecting\nthese variables, by means of Molecular Dynamics simulations of a polydisperse\ndisk packing, as a simple model system for granular material. Biaxial test\nboundary conditions with a periodically cycling load were implemented. The\neffect on the plastic response of the confining pressure, the deviatoric stress\nand the number of cycles has been investigated. The stiffness of the contacts\nand friction has been shown to play an important role in the overall response\nof the system. Specially elucidating is the influence of the particular\nhysteretical behavior in the stress-strain space on the accumulation of\npermanent strain and the energy dissipation.\n", "  We report the results of a ^63Cu and ^17O NMR study of the nuclear quadrupole\ninteraction tensor, ^(17,63)nu\\_{Q,alpha}, in the hole doped spin ladder system\nSr\\_(14-x)Ca\\_xCu\\_24O\\_41 (x = 0 and 12) performed under ambient and high\npressures. NMR data show that the hole density in the Cu\\_2O\\_3 ladder layer\ngrows with temperature, Ca content and an applied pressure. We have derived the\nhole occupation of Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals at the different ion sites in the\nCu\\_2O\\_3 ladder as a function of the temperature, Ca substitution and\npressure. We also suggest that the most important role of high pressure for the\nstabilization of a superconducting ground state in Ca-rich two-leg ladders is\nan increase of the hole concentration in the conducting Cu\\_2O\\_3 planes. We\nhave obtained an estimate of 0.10 hole per Cu1 for the hole concentration at\nlow temperature in Ca12 under 32 kbar when this compound undergoes a\nsuperconducting transition at 5K. Such a value fits fairly well with the doping\nphase diagram of cuprate superconductors.\n", "  In recent years there has been an intense search for room temperature\nferromagnetism in doped dilute semiconductors, which have many potentially\napplications in spintronics and optoelectronics. We report here the unexpected\nobservation of significant room temperature ferromagnetism in a semiconductor\ndoped with nonmagnetic impurities, Cu-doped TiO$_2$ thin films grown by Pulsed\nLaser Deposition. The magnetic moment, calculated from the magnetization\ncurves, resulted surprisingly large, about 1.5 $\\mu_B$ per Cu atom. A large\nmagnetic moment was also obtained from ab initio calculations using the\nsupercell method for TiO$_2$ with Cu impurities, but only if an oxygen vacancy\nin the nearest-neighbour shell of Cu was present. This result suggests that the\nrole of oxygen vacancies is crucial for the appearance of ferromagnetism. The\ncalculations also predict that Cu doping favours the formation of oxygen\nvacancies.\n", "  Extending recent numerical studies on two dimensional amorphous bodies, we\ncharacterize the approach of elastic continuum limit in three dimensional\n(weakly polydisperse) Lennard-Jones systems. While performing a systematic\nfinite-size analysis (for two different quench protocols) we investigate the\nnon-affine displacement field under external strain, the linear response to an\nexternal delta force and the low-frequency harmonic eigenmodes and their\ndensity distribution. Qualitatively similar behavior is found as in two\ndimensions. We demonstrate that the classical elasticity description breaks\ndown below an intermediate length scale $\\xi$, which in our system is\napproximately 23 molecular sizes. This length characterizes the correlations of\nthe non-affine displacement field, the self-averaging of external noise with\ndistance from the source and gives the lower wave length bound for the\napplicability of the classical eigenfrequency calculations. We trace back the\n\"Boson-peak\" of the density of eigenfrequencies (obtained from the velocity\nauto-correlation function) to the inhomogeneities on wave lengths smaller than\n$\\xi$.\n", "  The dynamics of evaporation of wetting droplets has been investigated\nexperimentally in an extended range of drop sizes, in order to provide trends\nrelevant for a theoretical analysis. A model is proposed, which generalises\nTanner's law, allowing us to smooth out the singularities both in dissipation\nand in evaporative flux at the moving contact line. A qualitative agreement is\nobtained, which represents a first step towards the solution of a very old,\ncomplex problem.\n", "  We present an analysis of the dependence of the resonant orbital order and\nmagnetic scattering spectra on the spin configuration. We consider an arbitrary\nspin direction with respect to the local crystal field axis, thus lowering\nsignificantly the local symmetry. To evaluate the atomic scattering in this\ncase, we generalized the Hannon-Trammel formula and implemented it inside the\nframework of atomic multiplet calculations in a crystal field. For an\nillustration, we calculate the magnetic and orbital scattering in the CE phase\nof \\lsmo in the cases when the spins are aligned with the crystal lattice\nvector ${\\vec a}$ (or equivalently ${\\vec b}$) and when they are rotated in the\n$ab$-plane by 45$^{\\circ}$ with respect to this axis. Magnetic spectra differ\nfor the two cases. For the orbital scattering, we show that for the former\nconfiguration there is a non negligible $\\sigma \\to \\sigma'$ ($\\pi \\to \\pi'$)\nscattering component, which vanishes in the 45$^\\circ$ case, while the $\\sigma\n\\to \\pi'$ ($\\pi \\to \\sigma'$) components are similar in the two cases. From the\nconsideration of two 90$^\\circ$ spin canted structures, we conclude there is a\nsignificant dependence of the orbital scattering spectra on the spin\narrangement. Recent experiments detected a sudden decrease of the orbital\nscattering intensity upon increasing the temperature above the N\\' eel\ntemperature in \\lsmo. We discuss this behavior considering the effect of\ndifferent types of misorientations of the spins on the orbital scattering\nspectrum.\n", "  We report on our recent progress in the manipulation and cooling of a\nmagnetically guided, high flux beam of $^{87}{\\rm Rb}$ atoms. Typically\n$7\\times 10^9$ atoms per second propagate in a magnetic guide providing a\ntransverse gradient of 800 G/cm, with a temperature $\\sim550$ $\\mu$K, at an\ninitial velocity of 90 cm/s. The atoms are subsequently slowed down to $\\sim\n60$ cm/s using an upward slope. The relatively high collision rate (5 s$^{-1}$)\nallows us to start forced evaporative cooling of the beam, leading to a\nreduction of the beam temperature by a factor of ~4, and a ten-fold increase of\nthe on-axis phase-space density.\n", "  We study the instability of a doubly quantized vortex topologically imprinted\non $^{23}$Na condensate, as reported in recent experiment [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{93}, 160406 (2004)]. We have performed numerical simulations using\nthree-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation with classical thermal noise.\nSplitting of a doubly quantized vortex turns out to be a process that is very\nsensitive to the presence of thermal atoms. We observe that even ve ry small\nthermal fluctuations, corresponding to 10 to 15% of thermal atoms, ca use the\ndecay of doubly quantized vortex into two singly quantized vortices in tens of\nmilliseconds. As in the experiment, the lifetime of doubly quantized vortex i s\na monotonic function of the interaction strength.\n", "  Dense granular media have a compaction between the random loose and random\nclose packings. For these dense media the concept of a granular pressure\ndepending on compaction is not unanimously accepted because they are often in a\n\"frozen\" state which prevents them to explore all their possible microstates, a\nnecessary condition for defining a pressure and a compressibility\nunambiguously. While periodic tapping or cyclic fluidization have already being\nused for that exploration, we here suggest that a succession of flowing states\nwith velocities slowly decreasing down to zero can also be used for that\npurpose. And we propose to deduce the pressure in \\emph{dense and flowing}\ngranular media from experiments measuring the thickness of the granular layer\nthat remains on a rough incline just after the flow has stopped.\n", "  We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, the controllable emission of\nmatter-wave bursts from a Bose-Einstein Condensate in a shallow optical dipole\ntrap. The process is triggered by spatial variations of the scattering length\nalong the trapping axis. In our approach, the outcoupling mechanism are\natom-atom interactions and thus, the trap remains unaltered. Once emitted, the\nmatter wave forms a robust soliton. We calculate analytically the parameters\nfor the experimental implementation of this atomic soliton machine gun.\n", "  Giant softening by 30 cm$^{-1}$ of the 490- and 620-cm$^{-1}$ modes is\nobserved by Raman scattering measurements below the Curie temperature of single\ncrystalline LaMnO$_{3+\\delta}$ ($0.085\\leq \\delta\\leq0.125$). A pseudogap-like\nelectronic continuum and a Fano antiresonance at 144 cm$^{-1}$ appear below the\ncharge ordering temperature. This gives evidence for the presence of an orbital\nfluctuating state and the formation of a hole stripe, respectively. This is\nfurther corroborated by a unstructured broadening and shifting of multiphonon\nfeatures with increasing doping $\\delta$. Our study suggests the significance\nof double exchange mechanism in the charged ordered insulating state.\n", "  Neutron diffraction studies of antiferromagnetic CoO confined to a vycor type\nporous glass demonstrate a continuous magnetic phase transition with a\ndecreased N\\'eel temperature and reduced magnetic moment as compared with the\nbulk.\n", "  The thermal conductivity of the heavy fermion superconductor PrOs4Sb12 was\nmeasured down to Tc/40 throughout the vortex state. At lowest temperatures and\nfor magnetic fields H ~ 0.07Hc2, already 40% of the normal state thermal\nconductivity is restored. This behaviour (similar to that observed in MgB2) is\na clear signature of multiband superconductivity in this compound.\n", "  We observe the suppression of the 1D transport of an interacting elongated\nBose-Einstein condensate in a random potential with a standard deviation small\ncompared to the typical energy per atom, dominated by the interaction energy.\nNumerical solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation reproduce well our\nobservations. We propose a scenario for disorder-induced trapping of the\ncondensate in agreement with our observations.\n", "  A microemulsion of decane droplets stabilized by a non-ionic surfactant film\nis progressively charged by substitution of a non-ionic surfactant molecule by\na cationic surfactant. We check that the microemulsion droplets remain\nidentical within the explored range of volume fraction (0.02 to 0.18) and of\nthe number of charge per droplets (0 to 40) . We probe the dynamics of these\nmicroemulsions by dynamic light scattering. Despite the similar structure of\nthe uncharged and charged microemulsions the dynamics are very different . In\nthe neutral microemulsion the fluctuations of polarization relax, as is well\nknown, via the collective diffusion of the droplets. In the charged\nmicroemulsions, two modes of relaxation are observed. The fast one is ascribed\nclassically to the collective diffusion of the charged droplets coupled to the\ndiffusion of the counterions. The slow one has, to our knowledge, not been\nobserved previously neither in similar microemulsions nor in charged spherical\ncolloids. We show that the slow mode is also diffusive and suggest that its\npossible origine is the relaxation of local charge fluctuations via local\nexchange of droplets bearing different number of charges . The diffusion\ncoefficient associated with this mode is then the self diffusion coefficient of\nthe droplets.\n", "  Simulations of nematic-isotropic transition of liquid crystals in two\ndimensions are performed using an O(2) vector model characterised by non linear\nnearest neighbour spin interaction governed by the fourth Legendre polynomial\n$P\\_4$. The system is studied through standard Finite-Size Scaling and\nconformal rescaling of density profiles of correlation functions. A topological\ntransition between a paramagnetic phase at high temperature and a critical\nphase at low temperature is observed. The low temperature limit is discussed in\nthe spin wave approximation and confirms the numerical results.\n", "  We show how to implement stick boundary conditions for a spherical colloid in\na solvent that is coarse-grained by the method of stochastic rotation dynamics.\nThis allows us to measure colloidal rotational velocity auto-correlation\nfunctions by direct computer simulation. We find quantitative agreement with\nEnskog theory for short times and with hydrodynamic mode-coupling theory for\nlonger times. For aqueous colloidal suspensions, the Enskog contribution to the\nrotational friction is larger than the hydrodynamic one when the colloidal\nradius drops below 35nm.\n", "  In some range of interlayer distances, the ground state of the\ntwo-dimensional electron gas at filling factor nu =4N+1 with N=0,1,2,... is a\ncoherent stripe phase in the Hartree-Fock approximation. This phase has\none-dimensional coherent channels that support charged excitations in the form\nof pseudospin solitons. In this work, we compute the transport gap of the\ncoherent striped phase due to the creation of soliton-antisoliton pairs using a\nsupercell microscopic unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach. We study this gap as\na function of interlayer distance and tunneling amplitude. Our calculations\nconfirm that the soliton-antisoliton excitation energy is lower than the\ncorresponding Hartree-Fock electron-hole pair energy. We compare our results\nwith estimates of the transport gap obtained from a field-theoretic model valid\nin the limit of slowly varying pseudospin textures.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the structure and electronic properties\nof nanotubes dispersed in a liquid phase. We show that the radial breathing\nmodes are upshifted in suspensions due to the molecular pressure of the\nsolvent. On the other hand, we directly probe charge transfer in solutions of\nnanotube polyelectrolytes and its reversibility after oxydation in air.\n", "  Exact results for the dynamic dimer and trimer structure factors of the\none-dimensional s=1/2 XX model in a transverse magnetic field ($\\parallel z$)\nare presented and discussed in relation to known exact results for the dynamic\nspin structure factors. In the framework of the Jordan-Wigner representation,\nthe accessible spectrum of the dimer fluctuation operator is limited to\ntwo-fermion excitations whereas that of the trimer fluctuation operator\ninvolves two-fermion and four-fermion excitations. The spectral boundaries,\nsoft modes, and singularity structure of the four-fermion excitation continuum\nas probed by the dynamic trimer structure factor are examined and compared with\ncorresponding properties of the two-fermion excitation continuum, as probed by\nthe dynamic dimer and transverse spin structure factors.\n", "  We present a theoretical approach to study the effects of an ac-field applied\nto quantum dots with semi-spherical symmetry. Using the Floquet formalism for\nthis periodically driven system, the time-dependent Hamiltonian in the\neffective mass approximation is solved. We show that the Hilbert space of\nsolutions is separated into orthogonal subspaces with different $z$-component\nof the angular momentum. We give an explicit analytical representation for\nelectronic states as a function of the intensity and frequency of the electric\nfield. Under the two level approximation, two particular cases are studied: the\nlow- and high-frequency regimes, which result of comparing the ac-field\nfrequency to the characteristic level splitting at zero field.\n", "  Modulated electroreflectance spectroscopy $\\Delta R/R$ of semiconductor\nself-assembled quantum dots is investigated. The structure is modeled as dots\nwith lens shape geometry and circular cross section. A microscopic description\nof the electroreflectance spectrum and optical response in terms of an external\nelectric field (${\\bf F}$) and lens geometry have been considered. The field\nand lens symmetry dependence of all experimental parameters involved in the\n$\\Delta R/R$ spectrum have been considered. Using the effective mass formalism\nthe energies and the electronic states as a function of ${\\bf F}$ and dot\nparameters are calculated. Also, in the framework of the strongly confined\nregime general expressions for the excitonic binding energies are reported.\nOptical selection rules are derived in the cases of the light wave vector\nperpendicular and parallel to $% {\\bf F}$. Detailed calculation of the Seraphin\ncoefficients and electroreflectance spectrum are performed for the InAs and\nCdSe nanostructures. Calculations show good agreement with measurements\nrecently performed on CdSe/ZnSe when statistical distribution on size is\nconsidered, explaining the main observed characteristic in the\nelectroreflectance spectra.\n", "  We present an exact diagrammatic approach for the problem of dimer-dimer\nscattering in 3D for dimers being a resonant bound state of two fermions in a\nspin-singlet state, with corresponding scattering length $a_F$. Applying this\napproach to the calculation of the dimer-dimer scattering length $a_B$, we\nrecover exactly the already known result $a_B=0.60 a_F$. We use the developed\napproach to obtain new results in 2D for fermions as well as for bosons.\nNamely, we calculate bound state energies for three $bbb$ and four $bbbb$\nresonantly interacting bosons in 2D. For the case of resonant interaction\nbetween fermions and bosons we calculate exactly bound state energies of the\nfollowing complexes: two bosons plus one fermion $bbf$, two bosons plus two\nfermions $bf_{\\uparrow}bf_{\\downarrow}$, and three bosons plus one fermion\n$bbbf$.\n", "  We present electronic transport measurements through thiolated C$_{60}$\nmolecules in liquid environment. The molecules were placed within a\nmechanically controllable break junction using a single anchoring group per\nmolecule. When varying the electrode separation of the C$_{60}$-modified\njunctions, we observed a peak in the conductance traces. The shape of the\ncurves is strongly influenced by the environment of the junction as shown by\nmeasurements in two distinct solvents. In the framework of a simple resonant\ntunneling model, we can extract the electronic tunneling rates governing the\ntransport properties of the junctions.\n", "  We present a model to study Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the\ncomposite material of amorphous nanowires. It is an extension of the model\nderived by two of us [Da Fonseca and Galvao, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 175502\n(2004)] to study the elastic properties of amorphous nanosprings. The model is\nbased on twisting and tensioning a straight nanowire and we propose an\nexperimental setup to obtain the elastic parameters of the nanowire. We used\nthe Kirchhoff rod model to obtain the expressions for the elastic constants of\nthe nanowire.\n", "  We consider either 3 spinless bosons or 3 equal mass spin-1/2 fermions,\ninteracting via a short range potential of infinite scattering length and\ntrapped in an isotropic harmonic potential. For a zero-range model, we obtain\nanalytically the exact spectrum and eigenfunctions: for fermions all the states\nare universal; for bosons there is a coexistence of decoupled universal and\nefimovian states. All the universal states, even the bosonic ones, have a tiny\n3-body loss rate. For a finite range model, we numerically find for bosons a\ncoupling between zero angular momentum universal and efimovian states; the\ncoupling is so weak that, for realistic values of the interaction range, these\nbosonic universal states remain long-lived and observable.\n", "  It is demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that the spin\nchirality associated with a noncoplanar spin configuration produces a\nmagneto-optical effect. Numerical study of the two-band Hubbard model on a\ntriangle cluster shows that the optical Hall conductivity $\\sigma_{xy}(\\omega)$\nis proportional to the spin chirality. The detailed comparative experiments on\npyrochlore-type molybdates $R_2$Mo$_2$O$_7$ with $R=$Nd (Ising-like moments)\nand $R=$Gd (Heisenberg-like ones) clearly distinguishes the two mechanisms,\ni.e., spin chirality and spin-orbit interactions. It is concluded that for\n$R$=Nd, $\\sigma_{xy}(\\omega)$ is dominated by the spin chirality for the dc\n($\\omega=0$) and the $d \\to d$ incoherent intraband optical transitions between\nMo atoms.\n", "  The evolution of granular shear flow is investigated as a function of height\nin a split-bottom Couette cell. Using particle tracking, magnetic-resonance\nimaging, and large-scale simulations we find a transition in the nature of the\nshear as a characteristic height $H^*$ is exceeded. Below $H^*$ there is a\ncentral stationary core; above $H^*$ we observe the onset of additional axial\nshear associated with torsional failure. Radial and axial shear profiles are\nqualitatively different: the radial extent is wide and increases with height\nwhile the axial width remains narrow and fixed.\n", "  The study of the anion ordered (TMTSF)\\_2ClO\\_4\\_(1-x)ReO\\_4\\_x, solid\nsolution in the limit of a low ReO\\_4- substitution level (0<=x<=17%) has\nrevealed a new and interesting phase diagram. Superconductivity is drastically\nsuppressed as the effect of ReO\\_4- non magnetic point defects increases\nfollowing the digamma behaviour for usual superconductors in the presence of\nparamagnetic impurities. Then, no long range order can be stabilized above 0.1K\nin a narrow window of substitution. Finally, an insulating SDW ground state in\nReO\\_4- -rich samples is rapidly stabilized with the decrease of the potential\nstrength leading to the doubling of the transverse periodicity. This extensive\nstudy has shown that the superconducting order parameter must change its sign\nover the Fermi surface.\n", "  We propose a mixed analytical-ab-initio method for the accurate calculation\nof the conductance in monovalent atomic wires. The method relies on the most\ngeneral formula for ballistic transport through a monovalent wire, whose\nparameters can be determined from first-principles calculations. Our central\nresult is the demonstration of the highly non-universal behavior of the\nconductance, which depends on the fine details of the contacts to the leads. We\nare therefore able to reconcile a large number of the apparently contradictory\nresults that have recently appeared in the literature.\n", "  We analyze the existence and stability of bright, dark, and gap matter-wave\nsolitons in optical superlattices. Then, using these properties, we show that\n(time-dependent) ``dynamical superlattices'' can be used to controllably place,\nguide, and manipulate these solitons. In particular, we use numerical\nexperiments to displace solitons by turning on a secondary lattice structure,\ntransfer solitons from one location to another by shifting one superlattice\nsubstructure relative to the other, and implement solitonic ``path-following'',\nin which a matter wave follows the time-dependent lattice substructure into\noscillatory motion.\n", "  A semi-quantitative cluster approach is developed to describe the charge\ntransfer (CT) electron-hole excitations in insulating cuprates in a rather wide\nenergy range up to 10- 15 eV. It generalizes the Zhang-Ng (ZN) model of CT\nexcitons by considering the complete set of Cu3d and O2p orbitals within the\nCuO4 embedded molecular cluster method and by introducing one-center\n(intra-center) Frenkel-like and two-center (inter-center) excitons. Special\nattention is paid to the transition matrix element effects both in optical and\nelectron energy loss spectra (EELS). In the latter case we obtain the momentum\ndependence of matrix elements both for intra-center and inter-center\ntransitions. We are able to give a semi-quantitative description of the optical\nand EELS spectra for a large number of 0D (like CuB2O4), 1D (Sr2CuO3) and 2D\n(like Sr2CuO2Cl2) insulating cuprates in a unifying manner. By comparing our\nanalysis with the experimental data we find that the CT gap in insulating\ncuprates is determined by nearly degenerate intra-center localized excitations\nand inter-center CT excitons. The corresponding EELS intensity is found to be\nstrongly k-dependent: even for isolated exciton it sharply decreases by\napproaching the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary. It is shown that the interaction\nof two-center excitons can result in destructive interference effects with an\nintensity compensation point.\n", "  A quantum shuttle is an archetypical nanoelectromechanical device, where the\nmechanical degree of freedom is quantized. Using a full-scale numerical\nsolution of the generalized master equation describing the shuttle, we have\nrecently shown [Novotn\\'{y} {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 92}, 248302\n(2004)] that for certain limits of the shuttle parameters one can distinguish\nthree distinct charge transport mechanisms: (i) an incoherent tunneling regime,\n(ii) a shuttling regime, where the charge transport is synchronous with the\nmechanical motion, and (iii) a coexistence regime, where the device switches\nbetween the tunneling and shuttling regimes. While a study of the cross-over\nbetween these three regimes requires the full numerics, we show here that by\nidentifying the appropriate time-scales it is possible to derive vastly simpler\nequations for each of the three regimes. The simplified equations allow a clear\nphysical interpretation, are easily solved, and are in good agreement with the\nfull numerics in their respective domains of validity.\n", "  The origin of the monoclinic distortion and domain formation in the quasi\ntwo-dimensional layer compound NbTe$_2$ is investigated. Angle-resolved\nphotoemission shows that the Fermi surface is pseudogapped over large portions\nof the Brillouin zone. Ab initio calculation of the electron and phonon\nbandstructure as well as the static RPA susceptibility lead us to conclude that\nFermi surface nesting and electron-phonon coupling play a key role in the\nlowering of the crystal symmetry and in the formation of the charge density\nwave phase.\n", "  The probability Psuccess(alpha, N) that stochastic greedy algorithms\nsuccessfully solve the random SATisfiability problem is studied as a function\nof the ratio alpha of constraints per variable and the number N of variables.\nThese algorithms assign variables according to the unit-propagation (UP) rule\nin presence of constraints involving a unique variable (1-clauses), to some\nheuristic (H) prescription otherwise. In the infinite N limit, Psuccess\nvanishes at some critical ratio alpha\\_H which depends on the heuristic H. We\nshow that the critical behaviour is determined by the UP rule only. In the case\nwhere only constraints with 2 and 3 variables are present, we give the phase\ndiagram and identify two universality classes: the power law class, where\nPsuccess[alpha\\_H (1+epsilon N^{-1/3}), N] ~ A(epsilon)/N^gamma; the stretched\nexponential class, where Psuccess[alpha\\_H (1+epsilon N^{-1/3}), N] ~\nexp[-N^{1/6} Phi(epsilon)]. Which class is selected depends on the\ncharacteristic parameters of input data. The critical exponent gamma is\nuniversal and calculated; the scaling functions A and Phi weakly depend on the\nheuristic H and are obtained from the solutions of reaction-diffusion equations\nfor 1-clauses. Computation of some non-universal corrections allows us to match\nnumerical results with good precision. The critical behaviour for constraints\nwith >3 variables is given. Our results are interpreted in terms of dynamical\ngraph percolation and we argue that they should apply to more general\nsituations where UP is used.\n", "  We derive the scaling structure of the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Berezinskii (KTB)\ntransition temperature of a homogeneous Bose gas in two dimensions within\ndiagrammatic perturbation theory. Approaching the system from above the\ntransition, we calculate the critical temperature, $T_{KT}$, and show how the\nsuperfluid mass density emerges from Josephson's relation as an interplay\nbetween the condensate density in a finite size system, and the infrared\nstructure of the single particle Green's function. We then discuss the trapped\ntwo-dimensional Bose gas, where the interaction changes the transition\nqualitatively from Bose-Einstein in an ideal gas to a KTB transition in the\nthermodynamic limit. We show that the transition temperature lies below the\nideal Bose-Einstein transition temperature, and calculate the first correction\nin terms of the interparticle interactions. The jump of the total superfluid\nmass at the transition is suppressed in a trapped system.\n", "  We use the Jordan-Wigner representation to study dynamic quantities for the\nspin-1/2 XX chain in a transverse magnetic field. We discuss in some detail the\nproperties of the four-fermion excitation continuum which is probed by the\ndynamic trimer structure factor.\n", "  We report on the dynamic nuclear polarization of a single charge-tunable\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dot in a longitudinal magnetic field of\n$\\sim$0.2T. The hyperfine interaction between the optically oriented electron\nand nuclei spins leads to the polarization of the quantum dot nuclei measured\nby the Overhauser-shift of the singly-charged excitons ($X^{+}$ and $X^{-}$).\nWhen going from $X^{+}$ to $X^{-}$, we observe a reversal of this shift which\nreflects the average electron spin optically written down in the quantum dot\neither in the $X^{+}$ state or in the final state of $X^{-}$ recombination. We\ndiscuss a theoretical model which indicates an efficient depolarization\nmechanism for the nuclei limiting their polarization to ~10%.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the {\\em nonlinear} susceptibility of\nMn$_{12}$ single-molecule magnets. We investigate both their\nthermal-equilibrium and dynamical nonlinear responses. The equilibrium results\nshow the sensitivity of the nonlinear susceptibility to the magnetic\nanisotropy, which is nearly absent in the linear response for axes distributed\nat random. The nonlinear dynamic response of Mn$_{12}$ was recently found to be\nvery large and displaying peaks reversed with respect to classical\nsuperparamagnets [F. Luis {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 92}, 107201\n(2004)]. Here we corroborate the proposed explanation -- strong field\ndependence of the relaxation rate due to the detuning of tunnel energy levels.\nThis is done by studying the orientational dependence of the nonlinear\nsusceptibility, which permits to isolate the quantum detuning contribution.\nBesides, from the analysis of the longitudinal and transverse contributions we\nestimate a bound for the decoherence time due to the coupling to the phonon\nbath.\n", "  We present an approximate analytical theory and direct numerical computation\nof defect modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate loaded in an optical lattice and\nsubject to an additional localized (defect) potential. Some of the modes are\nfound to be remarkably stable and can be driven along the lattice by means of a\ndefect moving following a step-like function defined by the period of Josephson\noscillations and the macroscopic stability of the atoms.\n", "  We have studied the magnetoresistance (TMR) of tunnel junctions with\nelectrodes of La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 and we show how the variation of the conductance\nand TMR with the bias voltage can be exploited to obtain a precise information\non the spin and energy dependence of the density of states. Our analysis leads\nto a quantitative description of the band structure of La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 and\nallows the determination of the gap delta between the Fermi level and the\nbottom of the t2g minority spin band, in good agreement with data from\nspin-polarized inverse photoemission experiments. This shows the potential of\nmagnetic tunnel junctions with half-metallic electrodes for spin-resolved\nspectroscopic studies.\n", "  We study XY spin systems on small world lattices for a variety of graph\nstructures, e.g. Poisson and scale-free, superimposed upon a one dimensional\nchain. In order to solve this model we extend the cavity method in the one\npure-state approximation to deal with real-valued dynamical variables. We find\nthat small-world architectures significantly enlarge the region in parameter\nspace where synchronization occurs. We contrast the results of population\ndynamics performed on a truncated set of cavity fields with Monte Carlo\nsimulations and find excellent agreement. Further, we investigate the\nappearance of replica symmetry breaking in the spin-glass phase by numerically\nanalyzing the proliferation of pure states in the message passing equations.\n", "  The asymmetric magnetization reversal in exchange biased Fe/MnF$_{2}$\ninvolves coherent (Stoner-Wohlfarth) magnetization rotation into an\nintermediate, stable state perpendicular to the applied field. We provide here\nexperimentally tested analytical conditions for the unambiguous observation of\nboth longitudinal and transverse magnetization components using the\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect. This provides a fast and powerful probe of\ncoherent magnetization reversal as well as its chirality. Surprisingly, the\nsign and asymmetry of the transverse magnetization component of Fe/MnF$_{2}$\nchange with the angle between cooling and measurement fields.\n", "  We study the statistics of the optimal path in both random and scale free\nnetworks, where weights $w$ are taken from a general distribution $P(w)$. We\nfind that different types of disorder lead to the same universal behavior.\nSpecifically, we find that a single parameter ($S \\equiv AL^{-1/\\nu}$ for\n$d$-dimensional lattices, and $S\\equiv AN^{-1/3}$ for random networks)\ndetermines the distributions of the optimal path length, including both strong\nand weak disorder regimes. Here $\\nu$ is the percolation connectivity exponent,\nand $A$ depends on the percolation threshold and $P(w)$. For $P(w)$ uniform,\nPoisson or Gaussian the crossover from weak to strong does not occur, and only\nweak disorder exists.\n", "  We have obtained microscopic evidence of the influence of domain wall stray\nfields on the nanosecond magnetization switching in magnetic trilayer systems.\nThe nucleation barrier initiating the magnetic switching of the soft magnetic\nFe20Ni80 layer in magnetic tunnel junction-like FeNi/Al2O3/Co trilayers is\nconsiderably lowered by stray fields generated by domain walls present in the\nhard magnetic Co layer. This internal bias field can significantly increase the\nlocal switching speed of the soft layer. The effect is visualized using\nnanosecond time- and layer-resolved magnetic domain imaging and confirmed by\nmicromagnetic simulations.\n", "  Hyperpolarized 3He is used to nondestructively probe by NMR the structure of\ncustom-made and commercial silica aerogels (97% and 98.5% porous). Large\nspin-echo signals are obtained at room temperature and very low magnetic field\n(2mT) even with small mounts of gas. Attenuation induced by applied field\ngradients results from the combined effects of gas diffusion and confinement by\nthe porous medium on atomic motion. Nitrogen is used as a buffer gas to reach\nequivalent 3He pressures ranging from 5 mbars to 3.5 bars. The observed\npressure dependence suggests a non-uniform structure of the aerogels on length\nscales up to tens of micrometers. A description by broad phenomenological\ndistributions of mean free paths is proposed, and quantitatively discussed by\ncomparison to numerical calculations. The investigated aerogel samples exhibit\ndifferent effective diffusion characteristics despite comparable nominal\nporosities.\n", "  We investigate the flowing behavior of dense suspensions of non-colloidal\nparticles, by coupling macroscopic rheometric experiments and local velocity\nand concentration measurements through MRI techniques. We find that the flow is\nlocalized at low velocities, and that the material is inhomogeneous; the local\nlaws inferred from macroscopic rheometric observations must then be\nreinterpreted in the light of these local observations. We show that the short\ntime response to a velocity step allows to characterize dense suspensions\nlocally: they have a purely viscous behavior, without any observable influence\nof friction. In the jammed zone, there may be a contact network, whereas in the\nsheared zone there are only hydrodynamic interactions: localization consists in\na change in configuration at the grain scale. From the concentration and\nvelocity profiles, we have provided for the first time local measurements of\nthe concentration dependence of viscosity; we find a Krieger-Dougherty law\n$\\eta(\\phi)=\\eta_0(1-\\phi/0.605)^{-2}$. Shear induced migration is almost\ninstantaneous and seems inconsistent with most observations: it would imply\nthat the diffusion coefficients strongly depend on the concentration. We\nfinally propose a simple constitutive law for dense suspensions, based on a\npurely viscous behavior, that accounts for all the macroscopic and local\nobservations.\n", "  The asymmetry of the magnetization reversal process in exchange biased\nFe/FeF$_2$ has been studied by magneto-optical Kerr effect. Qualitatively\ndifferent transverse magnetization loops are observed for different directions\nof the cooling and the measuring field. These loops can be simulated by a\nsimple calculation of the total energy density which includes the relevant\nmagnetic anisotropies and coherent magnetization rotation only. Asymmetric\nmagnetization reversal is shown to originate from the unidirectional anisotropy\nand may be observed if the external measuring field is not collinear with\neither the exchange bias or the easy axis of the antiferromagnetic epitaxial\nFeF$_2$(110) layer.\n", "  The irreversible growth of magnetic films is studied in three-dimensional\nconfined geometries of size $L\\times L\\times M$, where $M\\gg L$ is the growing\ndirection. Competing surface magnetic fields, applied to opposite corners of\nthe growing system, lead to the observation of a localization-delocalization\n(weakly rounded) transition of the interface between domains of up and down\nspins on the planes transverse to the growing direction. This effective\ntransition is the precursor of a true far-from-equilibrium corner wetting\ntransition that takes place in the thermodynamic limit. The phenomenon is\ncharacterized quantitatively by drawing a magnetic field-temperature phase\ndiagram, firstly for a confined sample of finite size, and then by\nextrapolating results, obtained with samples of different size, to the\nthermodynamic limit. The results of this work are a nonequilibrium realization\nof analogous phenomena recently investigated in equilibrium systems, such as\ncorner wetting transitions in the Ising model.\n", "  We use a fluctuating hydrodynamic approach to calculate the orientation\nfluctuations correlation functions of a thermotropic nematic liquid crystal in\na nonequilibrium state induced by a stationay heat flux. Since in this\nnonequilibrium stationary state the hydrodynamic fluctuations evolve on three\nwidely separated times scales, we use a time-scale perturbation procedure in\norder to partially diagonalize the hydrodynamic matrix. The wave number and\nfrequency dependence of these orientation correlation functions is evaluated\nand their explicit functional form on position is also calculated analytically\nin and out of equilibrium. We show that for both states these correlactions are\nlong-ranged. This result shows that indeed, even in equilibrium there is\nlong-range orientational order in the nematic, consistently with the well known\nproperties of these systems.We also calculate the dynamic structure of the\nfluid in both states for a geometry consistent with light scattering\nexperiments experiments. We find that as with isotropic simple fluids, the\nexternal temperature gradient introduces an asymmetry in the spectrum shifting\nits maximum by an amount proportional to the magnitude of the gradient. This\neffect may be of the order of 7 per cent. Also, the width at half height may\ndecrease by a factor of about 10 per cent. Since to our knowledge there are no\nexperimental results available in the literature to compare with, the\npredictions of our model calculation remains to be assessed.\n", "  We present classical density functional theory calculations of the free\nenergy landscape for fluids below their triple point as a function of density\nand crystallinity. We find that for both a model globular protein and for a\nsimple atomic fluid modeled with a Lennard-Jones interaction, it is\nfree-energetically easier to crystallize by passing through a metastable dense\nfluid in accord with the Ostwald rule of stages but in contrast to the\nalternative of ordering and densifying at once as assumed in the classical\npicture of crystallization.\n", "  {\\it Ab initio} computational methods for electronic transport in nanoscaled\nsystems are an invaluable tool for the design of quantum devices. We have\ndeveloped a flexible and efficient algorithm for evaluating $I$-$V$\ncharacteristics of atomic junctions, which integrates the non-equilibrium\nGreen's function method with density functional theory. This is currently\nimplemented in the package {\\it Smeagol}. The heart of {\\it Smeagol} is our\nnovel scheme for constructing the surface Green's functions describing the\ncurrent/voltage probes. It consists of a direct summation of both open and\nclosed scattering channels together with a regularization procedure of the\nHamiltonian, and provides great improvements over standard recursive methods.\nIn particular it allows us to tackle material systems with complicated\nelectronic structures, such as magnetic transition metals. Here we present a\ndetailed description of {\\it Smeagol} together with an extensive range of\napplications relevant for the two burgeoning fields of spin and\nmolecular-electronics.\n", "  We study the behavior of the optimal path between two sites separated by a\ndistance $r$ on a $d$-dimensional lattice of linear size $L$ with weight\nassigned to each site. We focus on the strong disorder limit, i.e., when the\nweight of a single site dominates the sum of the weights along each path. We\ncalculate the probability distribution $P(\\ell_{\\rm opt}|r,L)$ of the optimal\npath length $\\ell_{\\rm opt}$, and find for $r\\ll L$ a power law decay with\n$\\ell_{\\rm opt}$, characterized by exponent $g_{\\rm opt}$. We determine the\nscaling form of $P(\\ell_{\\rm opt}|r,L)$ in two- and three-dimensional lattices.\nTo test the conjecture that the optimal paths in strong disorder and flow in\npercolation clusters belong to the same universality class, we study the tracer\npath length $\\ell_{\\rm tr}$ of tracers inside percolation through their\nprobability distribution $P(\\ell_{\\rm tr}|r,L)$. We find that, because the\noptimal path is not constrained to belong to a percolation cluster, the two\nproblems are different. However, by constraining the optimal paths to remain\ninside the percolation clusters in analogy to tracers in percolation, the two\nproblems exhibit similar scaling properties.\n", "  We present a first-principles description of anisotropic materials\ncharacterized by having both weak (dispersion-like) and strong covalent bonds,\nbased on the Adiabatic--Connection Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem within\nDensity Functional Theory. For hexagonal boron nitride the in-plane and out of\nplane bonding as well as vibrational dynamics are well described both at\nequilibrium and when the layers are pulled apart. Also bonding in covalent and\nionic solids is described. The formalism allows to ping-down the deficiencies\nof common exchange-correlation functionals and provides insight towards the\ninclusion of dispersion interactions into the correlation functional.\n", "  The self-assembled quantum dot with lens domain has rotational symmetry but\nit is intrinsically asymmetric when the electron moves perpendicularly to its\ncircular base, {\\it i. e.} along the rotational axis. To characterize this\nasymmetry, an external electric field is applied along the positive or negative\ndirection of the rotational axis. We report the different Stark shifts\nappearing in the spectra as a function of the field intensity for different\nlens domains. It is shown that for a flat lens domain the asymmetry effects\ndecrease, but even for very flat lenses they can not be approximated by a\ncylindrical domain. Finally, some optical properties such as the dielectric\nconstant and electroabsorption are studied. Signatures of the energy spectrum\nreveal in these quantities. The importance of considering the proper lens\ndomain as long as the magnitude and direction field to tune a specific level\ntransition is stressed.\n", "  We study the stability of some strongly frustrated antiferromagnetic spin\nlattices in high magnetic fields against lattice distortions. In particular, we\nconsider a spin-s anisotropic Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the\nsquare-kagom\\'{e} and kagom\\'{e} lattices. The independent localized magnons\nembedded in a ferromagnetic environment, which are the ground state at the\nsaturation field, imply lattice instabilities for appropriate lattice\ndistortions fitting to the structure of the localized magnons. We discuss in\ndetail the scenario of this spin-Peierls instability in high magnetic fields\nwhich essentially depends on the values of the exchange interaction anisotropy\n\\Delta and spin s.\n", "  We present results on a series of 2D atomistic computer simulations of\namorphous systems subjected to simple shear in the athermal, quasistatic limit.\nThe athermal quasistatic trajectories are shown to separate into smooth,\nreversible elastic branches which are intermittently broken by discrete\ncatastrophic plastic events. The onset of a typical plastic event is studied\nwith precision, and it is shown that the mode of the system which is\nresponsible for the loss of stability has structure in real space which is\nconsistent with a quadrupolar source acting on an elastic matrix. The plastic\nevents themselves are shown to be composed of localized shear transformations\nwhich organize into lines of slip which span the length of the simulation cell,\nand a mechanism for the organization is discussed. Although within a single\nevent there are strong spatial correlations in the deformation, we find little\ncorrelation from one event to the next, and these transient lines of slip are\nnot to be confounded with the persistent regions of localized shear --\nso-called \"shear bands\" -- found in related studies. The slip lines gives rise\nto particular scalings with system length of various measures of event size.\nStrikingly, data obtained using three differing interaction potentials can be\nbrought into quantitative agreement after a simple rescaling, emphasizing the\ninsensitivity of the emergent plastic behavior in these disordered systems to\nthe precise details of the underlying interactions. The results should be\nrelevant to understanding plastic deformation in systems such as metallic\nglasses well below their glass temperature, soft glassy systems (such as dense\nemulsions), or compressed granular materials.\n", "  We introduce a nonequilibrium off--lattice model for anisotropic phenomena in\nfluids. This is a Lennard--Jones generalization of the driven lattice--gas\nmodel in which the particles' spatial coordinates vary continuously. A\ncomparison between the two models allows us to discuss some exceptional, hardly\nrealistic features of the original discrete system --which has been considered\na prototype for nonequilibrium anisotropic phase transitions. We thus help to\nclarify open issues, and discuss on the implications of our observations for\nfuture investigation of anisotropic phase transitions.\n", "  Spintronics is an approach to electronics in which the spin of the electrons\nis exploited to control the electric resistance R of devices. One basic\nbuilding block is the spin-valve, which is formed if two ferromagnetic\nelectrodes are separated by a thin tunneling barrier. In such devices, R\ndepends on the orientation of the magnetisation of the electrodes. It is\nusually larger in the antiparallel than in the parallel configuration. The\nrelative difference of R, the so-called magneto-resistance (MR), is then\npositive. Common devices, such as the giant magneto-resistance sensor used in\nreading heads of hard disks, are based on this phenomenon. The MR may become\nanomalous (negative), if the transmission probability of electrons through the\ndevice is spin or energy dependent. This offers a route to the realisation of\ngate-tunable MR devices, because transmission probabilities can readily be\ntuned in many devices with an electrical gate signal. Such devices have,\nhowever, been elusive so far. We report here on a pronounced gate-field\ncontrolled MR in devices made from carbon nanotubes with ferromagnetic\ncontacts. Both the amplitude and the sign of the MR are tunable with the gate\nvoltage in a predictable manner. We emphasise that this spin-field effect is\nnot restricted to carbon nanotubes but constitutes a generic effect which can\nin principle be exploited in all resonant tunneling devices.\n", "  We study numerically the ground-state phase diagram of the\nbilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain near the ferromagnetic instability point,\nwhere the existence of a gapped or gapless nondimerized quantum nematic phase\nhas been suggested. Our results, obtained by a highly accurate density-matrix\nrenormalization-group (DMRG) calculation are consistent with the view that the\norder parameter characterizing the dimer phase vanishes only at the point where\nthe system becomes ferromagnetic, although the existence of a gapped or gapless\nnondimerized phase in a very narrow parameter range between the ferromagnetic\nand the dimerized regimes cannot be ruled out.\n", "  By means of the non-equilibrium Green function and equation of motion method,\nthe electronic transport is theoretically studied through a parallel-coupled\ndouble quantum dots(DQD) in the presence of the on-dot Coulomb correlation,\nwith an emphasis put on the quantum interference. It has been found that in the\nCoulomb blockage regime, the quantum interference between the bonding and\nantiboding DQD states or that between their Coulomb blockade counterparts may\nresult in the Fano resonance in the conductance spectra, and the Fano peak\ndoublet may be observed under certain non-equilibrium condition. The\npossibility of manipulating the Fano lineshape is predicted by tuning the\ndot-lead coupling and magnetic flux threading the ring connecting the dots and\nleads. Similar to the case without Coulomb interaction, the direction of the\nasymmetric tail of Fano lineshape can be flipped by the external field. Most\nimportantly, by tuning the magnetic flux, the function of four relevant states\ncan be interchanged, giving rise to the swap effect, which might play a key\nrole as a qubit in the quantum computation.\n", "  When insulator LaAlO3 is grown by epitaxy onto a TiO2-terminated {100}\nsurface of insulator SrTiO3, the resulting system has a metallic character.\nThis phenomenon has been associated with an electrostatic frustration at the\ninterface, as {100} surfaces of SrTiO3 are neutral while those of LaAlO3 are\npolar, but its microscopic mechanism is not quite understood. Here, we present\na structural characterisation of this interface by aberration-corrected\ntransmission electron microscopy. The unit cells at the interface appear\nelongated: we discuss this distortion in terms of electrostatic charge and\nextra carriers at the interface.\n", "  We present a neutron scattering analysis of the structure of the smectic\nliquid crystal octylcyanobiphenyl (8CB) confined in one-dimensional nanopores\nof porous silicon films (PS). The smectic transition is completely suppressed,\nleading to the extension of a short-range ordered smectic phase aligned along\nthe pore axis. It evolves reversibly over an extended temperature range, down\nto 50 K below the \\textit{N-SmA} transition in pure 8CB. This behavior strongly\ndiffers from previous observations of smectics in different one-dimensional\nporous materials. A coherent picture of this striking behavior requires that\nquenched disorder effects are invoked. The strongly disordered nature of the\ninner surface of PS acts as random fields coupling to the smectic order. The\none-dimensionality of PS nano-channels offers new perspectives on quenched\ndisorder effects, which observation has been restricted to homogeneous random\nporous materials so far.\n", "  We propose a short overview of a few selected issues of magnetism in reduced\ndimensions, which are the most relevant to set the background for more\nspecialized contributions to the present Special Issue. Magnetic anisotropy in\nreduced dimensions is discussed, on a theoretical basis, then with experimental\nreports and views from surface to single-atom anisotropy. Then conventional\nmagnetization states are reviewed, including macrospins, single domains,\nmultidomains, and domain walls in stripes. Dipolar coupling is examined for\nlateral interactions in arrays, and for interlayer interactions in films and\ndots. Finally thermally-assisted magnetization reversal and superparamagnetism\nare presented. For each topic we sought a balance between well established\nknowledge and recent developments.\n", "  We report ^{17}O Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) results in the stripe\nordered La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_{x}CuO_4 system. Below a temperature T_q ~ 80K,\nthe local electric field gradient (EFG) and the absolute intensity of the NMR\nsignal of the planar O site exhibit a dramatic decrease. We interpret these\nresults as microscopic evidence for a spatially inhomogeneous charge\ndistribution, where the NMR signal from O sites in the domain walls of the spin\ndensity modulation are wiped out due to large hyperfine fields, and the\nremaining signal arises from the intervening Mott insulating regions.\n", "  We have investigated the electronic structure of the equiatomic EuAuMg,\nGdAuMg, YbAuMg and GdAgMg intermetallics using x-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy. The spectra revealed that the Yb and Eu are divalent while the Gd\nis trivalent. The spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level is\ndominated by the mix of Mg $s$, Au/Ag $sp$ and $RE$ $spd$ bands, and not by the\n$RE$ $4f$. We also found that the Au and Ag $d$ bands are extraordinarily\nnarrow, as if the noble metal atoms were impurities submerged in a low density\n$sp$ metal host. The experimental results were compared with band structure\ncalculations, and we found good agreement provided that the spin-orbit\ninteraction in the Au an Ag $d$ bands is included and correlation effects in an\nopen $4f$ shell are accounted for using the local density approximation +\nHubbard $U$ scheme. Nevertheless, limitations of such a mean-field scheme to\nexplain excitation spectra are also evident.\n", "  We present a calculation of the low lying spectrum of a rotating\nBose-Einstein condensate. We show that in a cylindrical geometry, there exist\ntwo linear branches, one associated to usual acoustic excitation, the other\ncorresponding to a twisting mode of the vortex lattice. Using a hydrodynamical\napproach we derive the elasticity coefficient of the vortex lattice and\ncalculate the spectrum of condensate in a three dimensionnal harmonic trap with\ncylindrical symmetry.\n", "  We study the basal-plane anisotropies of reversible magnetization and torque\nin a mixed state of layered d-wave superconductors based on the quasiclassical\nversion of the BCS-Gor'kov theory. Both the longitudinal magnetization ($M_L$)\nand torque ($\\tau$) show fourfold oscillations as a function of the field angle\n$\\chi$. The relationship between the node position and the oscillatory patterns\nshown by $M_L$ and $\\tau$ is clarified. It is also shown that the sign of the\n$\\tau (\\chi)$-oscillation does not change between $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$, while\nthe sign of the $M_L (\\chi)$-oscillation changes. The newly obtained result for\n$\\tau$ indicates that the torque experiment can allow us to detect the in-plane\nanisotropies of $H_{c2}$ even in a material with strong fluctuations such as\ncuprate or organic superconductors, where the $H_{c2}$ itself cannot be\ndetermined experimentally.\n", "  A study of the transport coefficients of a system of elastic hard disks,\nbased on the use of Helfand-Einstein expressions is reported. The\nself-diffusion, the viscosity, and the heat conductivity are examined with\naveraging techniques especially appropriate for the use in event-driven\nmolecular dynamics algorithms with periodic boundary conditions. The density\nand size dependence of the results is analyzed, and comparison with the\npredictions from Enskog's theory is carried out. In particular, the behavior of\nthe transport coefficients in the vicinity of the fluid-solid transition is\ninvestigated and a striking power law divergence of the viscosity in this\nregion is obtained, while all other examined transport coefficients show a drop\nin that density range.\n", "  Like emulsions, pastes and many other forms of soft condensed matter, aqueous\nfoams present slow mechanical relaxations when subjected to a stress too small\nto induce any plastic flow. To identify the physical origin of this\nviscoelastic behaviour, we have simulated how dry disordered coarsening 2D\nfoams respond to a small applied stress. We show that the mechanism of long\ntime relaxation is driven by coarsening induced rearrangements of small bubble\nclusters. These findings are in full agreement with a scaling law previously\nderived from experimental creep data for 3D foams. Moreover, we find that the\ntemporal statistics of coarsening induced bubble rearrangements are described\nby a Poisson process.\n", "  In this short communication, I give a very simple derivation of the Jarzynski\nequality, which allows to compute the free energy difference of a body, which\nis driven between two equilibrium states $A$ and $B$ by an external\n(time-dependent) force, from the probability distribution function of the work\ndone on the system, regardless of the nature of the transformation (reversible\nor irreversible) between the states $A$ and $B$. It perhaps throws some light\non the debate recently started by Cohen and coworkers, and perhaps explains why\nall the experiments which has been performed in order to test the Jarzynski\nequality are successful, even in very defavorable (irreversible) cases (and\nmore strikingly, when the state $B$ is not an equilibrium one).\n", "  We report an experimental study of a dilute \"gas\" of inelastically colliding\nparticles excited by vibrations in low gravity. We show that recording the\ncollision frequency together with the impulses on a wall of the container gives\naccess to several quantities of interest. We observe that the mean collision\nfrequency does not scale linearly with the number N of particles in the\ncontainer. This is due to the dissipative nature of the collisions and is also\ndirectly related to the non extensive behaviour of the kinetic energy (the\ngranular temperature is not intensive).\n", "  In order to gain some insight on the electronic relaxation mechanisms\noccuring in diamond under high intensity laser excitation and/or VUV\nexcitation, we studied experimentally the pulsed conductivity induced by\nfemtosecond VUV pulses, as well as the energy spectra of the photoelectrons\nreleased by the same irradiation. The source of irradiation consists in highly\ncoherent VUV pulses obtained through high order harmonic generation of a high\nintensity femtosecond pulse at a 1.55 eV photon energy (titanium-doped sapphire\nlaser). Harmonics H9 to H17 have been used for photoconductivity (PC) and\nharmonics H13 to H27 for photoemission experiments (PES). As the photon energy\nis increased, it is expected that the high energy photoelectrons will generate\nsecondary e-h pairs, thus increasing the excitation density and consequently\nthe PC signal. This is not what we observe : the PC signal first increases for\nH9 to H13, but then saturates and even decreases. Production of low energy\nsecondary e-h pairs should also be observed in the PES spectrum. In fact we\nobserve very few low energy electrons in the PES spectrum obtained with H13 and\nH15, despite the sufficient energy of the generated free carriers. At the other\nend (H21 and above), a very intense low energy secondary electron peak is\nobserved. As a help to interprete such data, we realized the first ab initio\ncalculations of the electronic lifetime of quasiparticles, in the GW\napproximation in a number of dielectrics including diamond. We find that the\nresults are quite close to a simple \"Fermi-liquid\" estimation using the\nelectronic density of diamond. We propose that a quite efficient mechanism\ncould be the excitation of plasmons by high energy electrons, followed by the\nrelaxation of plasmons into individual e-h pairs.\n", "  This letter reports experimental and numerical results on particle dynamics\nin an out-of-equilibrium granular medium. We observed two distinct types of\ngrain motion: the well known cage motion, during which a grain is always\nsurrounded by the same neighbors, and low probability \"jumps\", during which a\ngrain moves significantly more relative to the others. These observations are\nsimilar to the results obtained for other out-of-equilibrium systems (glasses,\ncolloidal systems, etc.). Although such jumps are extremely rare, by inhibiting\nthem in numerical simulations we demonstrate that they play a significant role\nin the relaxation of out-of-equilibrium systems\n", "  We consider the possibility of quantum phase transitions in the ground state\nof triplet superconductors where particle density is the tunning parameter. For\ndefiniteness, we focus on the case of one band quasi-one-dimensional triplet\nsuperconductors but many of our conclusions regarding the nature of the\ntransition are quite general. Within the functional integral formulation, we\ncalculate the electronic compressibility and superfluid density tensor as a\nfunction of the particle density for various triplet order parameter symmetries\nand find that these quantities are non-analytic when a critical value of the\nparticle density is reached.\n", "  In this contribution we would like to revisit the problems of ferromagnetism\n(F) and antiferromagnetism (AF) in the pure itinerant model. These methods can\nbe extended later to the superconducting materials. In our model we assume the\nextended Hubbard Hamiltonian. Transition from the paramagnetic state to the\nordered state of magnetic nature is decided by the competition between kinetic\nand potential energy in which there is an increase in the kinetic energy\nmoderated by the inter-site interactions, and a decrease in the potential\nenergy. The competition between these two energies results in the existence of\ncritical values of interactions for creating magnetic alignment. Only when\nexisting in a given material interaction exceeds the critical value for a given\ntype of ordering we can have the alignment of this type.\n  The influence of inter-site correlation on F and AF in the presence of\nCoulomb on-site correlation is investigated. The well known Landau free energy\nexpansion is corrected for both F and AF ordering to reflect the presence of\ncritical interaction in the second order term, which leads to the magnetic\nalignment.\n  The numerical results show that the inter-site interactions favor F at the\nend of the band and AF at the half-filled point. In both cases of F and AF\nordering, these interactions lower substantially the Curie and Neel's\ntemperature towards experimental data. This helps to remove the paradox in\nmagnetism that has persisted for a long time.\n", "  Ta$_{2}$S$_{2}$C compound undergoes superconducting transitions at $T_{cl} =\n3.60 \\pm 0.02$ K and $T_{cu} = 9.0 \\pm 0.2$ K. The nature of successive\nsuperconducting transitions has been studied from electrical resistivity,\nlinear and nonlinear AC magnetic susceptibilities. The resistivity $\\rho$ at\n$H$ = 0 shows a local maximum near $T_{cu}$, a kink-like behavior around\n$T_{cl}$, and reduces to zero at below $T_{0}$ = 2.1 K. The $\\ln T$ dependence\nof $\\rho$ is observed at $H$ = 50 kOe at low temperatures, which is due to\ntwo-dimensional weak-localization effect. Below $T_{cu}$ a two-dimensional\nsuperconducting phase occurs in each TaC layer. The linear and nonlinear\nsusceptibilities $\\chi_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}$, $\\chi_{3}^{\\prime}$,\n$\\chi_{5}^{\\prime}$, and $\\chi_{7}^{\\prime}$ as well as the difference\n$\\delta\\chi$ ($= \\chi_{FC} - \\chi_{ZFC}$) between the FC and ZFC\nsusceptibilities, start to appear below 6.0 K, the onset temperature of\nirreversibility. A drastic growth of the in-plane superconducting coherence\nlength below 6.0 K gives rise to a three-dimensional superconducting phase\nbelow $T_{cl}$, through interplanar Josephson couplings between adjacent TaC\nlayers. The oscillatory behavior of $\\chi_{3}^{\\prime\\prime}$,\n$\\chi_{5}^{\\prime\\prime}$, and $\\chi_{7}^{\\prime\\prime} $ below $T_{cl}$ is\nrelated to the nonlinear behavior arising from the thermally activated flux\nflow.\n", "  The scaling properties of post-mortem fracture surfaces of brittle (silica\nglass), ductile (aluminum alloy) and quasi-brittle (mortar and wood) materials\nhave been investigated. These surfaces, studied far from the initiation, were\nshown to be self-affine. However, the Hurst exponent measured along the crack\ndirection is found to be different from the one measured along the propagation\ndirection. More generally, a complete description of the scaling properties of\nthese surfaces call for the use of the 2D height-height correlation function\nthat involves three exponents zeta = 0.75, beta = 0.6 and z = 1.25 independent\nof the material considered as well as of the crack growth velocity. These\nexponents are shown to correspond to the roughness, growth and dynamic\nexponents respectively, as introduced in interface growth models. They are\nconjectured to be universal.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the density profile of a trapped strongly\ninteracting Fermi gas with unbalanced spin populations. Making the assumption\nof the existence of a first order phase transition between an unpolarized\nsuperfluid phase and a fully polarized normal phase, we show good agreement\nwith a recent experiment presented in Partridge et al.\n", "  We show that the semi-classical model of conduction breaks down if the mean\nfree path of charge carriers is smaller than a typical extension of their\nwavefunction. This situation is realized for sufficiently slow charge carriers\nand leads to a transition from a metallic like to an insulating like regime\nwhen scattering by defects increases. This explains the unconventional\nconduction properties of quasicrystals and related alloys. The conduction\nproperties of some heavy fermions or polaronic systems, where charge carriers\nare also slow, present a deep analogy.\n", "  We investigate the critical speeding up of heat equilibration by the piston\neffect (PE) in a nearly supercritical van der Waals (vdW) fluid confined in a\nhomogeneous porous medium. We perform an asymptotic analysis of the averaged\nlinearized mass, momentum and energy equations to describe the response of the\nmedium to a boundary heat flux. While nearing the critical point (CP), we find\ntwo universal crossovers depending on porosity, intrinsic permeability and\nviscosity. Closer to the CP than the first crossover, a pressure gradient\nappears in the bulk due to viscous effects, the PE characteristic time scale\nstops decreasing and tends to a constant. In infinitly long samples the\ntemperature penetration depth is larger than the diffusion one indicating that\nthe PE in porous media is not a finite size effect as it is in pure fluids.\nCloser to the CP, a second cross over appears which is characterized by a\npressure gradient in the thermal boundary layer (BL). Beyond this second\ncrossover, the PE time remains constant, the expansion of the fluid in the BL\ndrops down and the PE ultimately fades away.\n", "  We present investigations of Josephson charge-phase qubits inductively\ncoupled to a radio-frequency driven tank-circuit enabling the readout of the\nstates by measuring the Josephson inductance of the qubit. The circuits\nincluding junctions with linear dimensions of 60 nm and 80 nm are fabricated\nfrom Nb trilayer and allowing the determination of relevant sample parameters\nat liquid helium temperature. The observed partial suppression of the\ncirculating supercurrent at 4.2 K is explained in the framework of a quantum\nstatistical model. We have probed the ground-state properties of qubit\nstructures with different ratios of the Josephson coupling to Coulomb charging\nenergy at 20 mK, demonstrating both the magnetic control of phase and the\nelectrostatic control of charge on the qubit island.\n", "  It is known that the nonextensive statistics was originally formulated for\nthe systems composed of subsystems having same $q$. In this paper, the\nexistence of composite system with different $q$ subsystems is investigated by\nfitting the power law degree distribution of air networks with $q$-exponential\ndistribution. Then a possible extension the nonextensive statistics to\ndifferent $q$ systems is provided on the basis of an entropy nonadditivity rule\nand an unnormalized expectation of energy.\n", "  This is a study of composition rule and temperature definition for\nnonextensive systems containing different $q$ subsystems. The physical meaning\nof the multiplier $\\beta$ associated with the energy expectation in the\noptimization of Tsallis entropy is investigated for the formalism with\nnormalized expectation given by escort probability. This study is carried out\nfor two possible cases: the case of the approximation of additive energy; and\nthe case of nonadditive energy prescribed by an entropy composition rule for\ndifferent $q$ systems.\n", "  Resistivity under pressure and magnetization measurements on\nBa$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$VS$_3$ single crystals with 0 $\\leq x \\leq$ 0.18 and no sulphur\ndeficiency show an abrupt onset of ferromagnetic (FM) order at a critical value\n$x$=0.07, concomitant to a change of the magnetic properties at the\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) and to a collapse of the unit cell at ambient\ntemperature. A reduction of the MIT temperature to 50 K upon $x$ that scales as\nthe V-S distance is also observed. This gives evidence of a chemical pressure\ninduced quantum phase transition that stabilizes the incipient FM order of\nBaVS$_3$. The $0.07<x$ results suggest a coexistence of FM and metallic phases\nat larger $x$.\n", "  Within a semi--infinite thre--dimensional lattice gas model describing the\ncoexistence of two phases on a substrate, we study, by cluster expansion\ntechniques, the free energy (line tension) associated with the contact line\nbetween the two phases and the substrate. We show that this line tension, is\ngiven at low temperature by a convergent series whose leading term is negative,\nand equals 0 at zero temperature.\n", "  y formally diagonalizing with accuracy $\\hbar$ the Hamiltonian of electrons\nin a crystal subject to electromagnetic perturbations, we resolve the debate on\nthe Hamiltonian nature of semiclassical equations of motion with Berry-phase\ncorrections, and therefore confirm the validity of the Liouville theorem. We\nshow that both the position and momentum operators acquire a Berry-phase\ndependence, leading to a non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. The equations of\nmotion turn out to be identical to the ones previously derived in the context\nof electron wave-packets dynamics.\n", "  Within Density Functional Theory, we have calculated the energy of the\ntransitions from the ground state to the first two excited states in the\nelectron bubbles in liquid helium at pressures from zero to about the\nsolidification pressure.\n  For $^4$He at low temperatures, our results are in very good agreement with\ninfrared absorption experiments. Above a temperature of $\\sim 2$ K, we\noverestimate the energy of the $1s-1p$ transition. We attribute this to the\nbreak down of the Franck-Condon principle due to the presence of helium vapor\ninside the bubble. Our results indicate that the $1s-2p$ transition energies\nare sensitive not only to the size of the electron bubble, but also to its\nsurface thickness. We also present results for the infrared transitions in the\ncase of liquid $^3$He, for which we lack of experimental data.\n", "  The relation between the conductivity tensors of Composite Fermions and\nelectrons is extended to second generation Composite Fermions. It is shown that\nit crucially depends on the coupling matrix for the Chern-Simons gauge field.\nThe results are applied to a model of interacting Composite Fermions that can\nexplain both the anomalous plateaus in spin polarization and the corresponding\nmaxima in the resistivity observed in recent transport experiments.\n", "  Experiments reveal that PbK2LiNb5O15 which belongs to the tetragonal tungsten\nbronze family presents paraelectric and ferroelectric phases and a complex\nstructural change between them. High and low temperature phases are of symmetry\nP4/mbm and Pba2 respectively, so that this change is also of ferroelastic type.\nAs presented here, crystallographic results hint at a displacive character of\nthe ferroelectric ordering but show a more complex behaviour, with a clear\norder-disorder mechanism which accompanies the appearance of ferroelasticity.\nTo complete our knowledge of this material, we have performed Raman experiments\nwhich exhibit a low frequency mode, but no clear soft mode is observed.\n", "  Inelastic and elastic neutron scattering have been used to study a single\ncrystal of the Ni$_{54}$Mn$_{23}$Al$_{23}$ Heusler alloy over a broad\ntemperature range. The paper reports the first experimental determination of\nthe low-lying phonon dispersion curves for this alloy system. We find that the\nfrequencies of the TA$_2$ modes are relatively low. This branch exhibits an\nanomaly (dip) at a wave number $\\xi_{0} ={1/3}\\approx 0.33$, which softens with\ndecreasing temperature. Associated with this anomalous dip at $\\xi_{0}$, an\nelastic central peak scattering is also present. We have also observed\nsatellites due to the magnetic ordering.\n", "  We have studied the relevance of spin-orbit coupling to the dispersion 00009\nrelation of the Larmor resonance observed in inelastic light scattering and\nelectron-spin resonance experiments on GaAs quantum wells. We show that the\nspin-orbit interaction, here described by a sum of Dresselhaus and\nBychkov-Rashba terms, couples Zeeman and spin-density excitations. We have\nevaluated its contribution to the spin splitting as a function of the magnetic\nfield $B$, and have found that in the small $B$ limit, the spin-orbit\ninteraction does not contribute to the spin splitting, whereas at high magnetic\nfields it yields a $B$ independent contribution to the spin splitting given by\n$2(\\lambda_R^2-\\lambda_D^2)$, with $\\lambda_{R,D}$ being the intensity of the\nBychkov-Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit terms.\n", "  We investigate the valence intraband transitions in p-doped self-assembled\nInAs quantum dots using far-infrared magneto-optical technique with polarized\nradiation. We show that a purely electronic model is unable to account for the\nexperimental data. We calculate the coupling between the mixed hole LO-phonon\nstates using the Fr\\\"ohlich Hamiltonian, from which we determine the polaron\nstates as well as the energies and oscillator strengths of the valence\nintraband transitions. The good agreement between the experiments and\ncalculations provides strong evidence for the existence of hole-polarons and\ndemonstrates that the intraband magneto-optical transitions occur between\npolaron states.\n", "  We compare two distincts models of evaporative cooling of a magnetically\nguided atomic beam: a continuous one, consisting in approximating the atomic\ndistribution function by a truncated equilibrium distribution, and a\ndiscrete-step one, in which the evaporation process is described in terms of\nsuccessive steps consisting in a truncation of the distribution followed by\nrethermalization. Calculations are performed for the semi-linear potential\nrelevant for experiments. We show that it is possible to map one model onto the\nother, allowing us to infer, for the discrete-step model, the rethermalization\nkinetics, which turns out to be strongly dependent upon the shape of the\nconfining potential.\n", "  We report on the implementation of evaporative cooling of a magnetically\nguided beam by adsorption on a ceramic surface. We use a transverse magnetic\nfield to shift locally the beam towards the surface, where atoms are\nselectively evaporated. With a 5~mm long ceramic piece, we gain a factor\n$1.5\\pm0.2$ on the phase space density. Our results are consistent with a 100%\nefficiency of this evaporation process. The flexible implementation that we\nhave demonstrated, combined with the very local action of the evaporation zone,\nmakes this method particularly suited for the evaporative cooling of a beam.\n", "  We report on the most complete investigation to date of the 4f-electron\nproperties at the gamma-alpha transition in elemental Ce by resonant inelastic\nx-ray scattering (RIXS). The Ce 2p3d-RIXS spectra were measured directly in the\nbulk material as a function of pressure through the transition. The spectra\nwere simulated within the Anderson impurity model. The occupation number nf was\nderived from the calculations in both gamma- and alpha-phases in the ground\nstate along with the f doubleoccupancy. We find that the electronic structure\nchanges result mainly from band formation of 4f electrons which concurs with\nreduced electron correlation and increased Kondo screening at high pressure.\n", "  The dynamics of magnetic domain wall motion in the FeNi layer of a\nFeNi/Al2O3/Co trilayer has been investigated by a combination of x-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism, photoelectron emission microscopy, and a stroboscopic\npump-probe technique. The nucleation of domains and subsequent expansion by\ndomain wall motion in the FeNi layer during nanosecond-long magnetic field\npulses was observed in the viscous regime up to the Walker limit field. We\nattribute an observed delay of domain expansion to the influence of the domain\nwall energy that acts against the domain expansion and that plays an important\nrole when domains are small.\n", "  In this work we study the condition number of the least square matrix\ncorresponding to scale free networks. We compute a theoretical lower bound of\nthe condition number which proves that they are ill conditioned. Also, we\nanalyze several matrices from networks generated with the linear preferential\nattachment model showing that it is very difficult to compute the power law\nexponent by the least square method due to the severe lost of accuracy expected\nfrom the corresponding condition numbers.\n", "  We explore the possibility that hyperfine interaction causes the recently\ndiscovered organic magnetoresistance (OMAR) effect. Our study employs both\nexperiment and theoretical modelling. An excitonic pair mechanism model based\non hyperfine interaction, previously suggested by others to explain magnetic\nfield effects in organics, is examined. Whereas this model can explain a few\nkey aspects of the experimental data, we, however, uncover several fundamental\ncontradictions as well. By varying the injection efficiency for minority\ncarriers in the devices, we show experimentally that OMAR is only weakly\ndependent on the ratio between excitons formed and carriers injected, likely\nexcluding any excitonic effect as the origin of OMAR.\n", "  In this work we introduce an energy function in order to study finite scale\nfree graphs generated with different models. The energy distribution has a\nfractal pattern and presents log periodic oscillations for high energies. This\noscillations are related to a discrete scale invariance of certain graphs, that\nis, there are preferred scaling ratios suggesting a hierarchical distribution\nof node degrees. On the other hand, small energies correspond to graphs with\nevenly distributed degrees.\n", "  We study the growth of an elongated phase-fluctuating condensate from a\nnon-equilibrium thermal cloud obtained by shock-cooling. We compare the growth\nof the condensate with numerical simulations, revealing a time delay and a\nreduction in the growth rate which we attribute to phase fluctuations. We\nmeasure the phase coherence using momentum Bragg spectroscopy, and thereby\nobserve the evolution of the phase coherence as a function of time. Combining\nthe phase coherence results with the numerical simulations, we suggest a simple\nmodel for the reduction of the growth rate based on the reduction of bosonic\nstimulation due to phase fluctuations and obtain improved agreement between\ntheory and experiment.\n", "  The ferromagnetism of a thin GaMnAs layer with a perpendicular easy\nanisotropy axis is investigated by means of several techniques, that yield a\nconsistent set of data on the magnetic properties and the domain structure of\nthis diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor. The magnetic layer was grown under\ntensile strain on a relaxed GaInAs buffer layer using a procedure that limits\nthe density of threading dislocations. Magnetometry, magneto-transport and\npolar magneto-optical Kerr effect (PMOKE) measurements reveal the high quality\nof this layer, in particular through its high Curie temperature (130 K) and\nwell-defined magnetic anisotropy. We show that magnetization reversal is\ninitiated from a limited number of nucleation centers and develops by easy\ndomain wall propagation. Furthermore, MOKE microscopy allowed us to\ncharacterize in detail the magnetic domain structure. In particular we show\nthat domain shape and wall motion are very sensitive to some defects, which\nprevents a periodic arrangement of the domains. We ascribed these defects to\nthreading dislocations emerging in the magnetic layer, inherent to the growth\nmode on a relaxed buffer.\n", "  We study the statistical properties of overdamped particles driven by two\ncross-correlated multiplicative Gaussian white noises in a time-dependent\nenvironment. Using the Langevin and Fokker-Planck approaches, we derive the\nexact probability distribution function for the particle positions, calculate\nits moments and find their corresponding long-time, asymptotic behaviors. The\ngenerally anomalous diffusive regimes of the particles are classified, and\ntheir dependence on the friction coefficient and the characteristics of the\nnoises is analyzed in detail. The asymptotic predictions are confirmed by exact\nsolutions for two examples.\n", "  We report on the first observation of a pronounced re-entrant\nsuperconductivity phenomenon in superconductor/ferromagnetic layered systems.\nThe results were obtained using a superconductor/ferromagnetic-alloy bilayer of\nNb/Cu(1-x)Ni(x). The superconducting transition temperature T_{c} drops sharply\nwith increasing thickness d_{CuNi} of the ferromagnetic layer, until complete\nsuppression of superconductivity is observed at d_{CuNi}= 4 nm. Increasing the\nCu(1-x)Ni(x) layer thickness further, superconductivity reappears at\nd_{CuNi}=13 nm. Our experiments give evidence for the pairing function\noscillations associated with a realization of the quasi-one dimensional\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) like state in the ferromagnetic layer.\n", "  We present a complete calculation of the structure of liquid $^4$He confined\nto a concave nanoscopic wedge, as a function of the opening angle of the walls.\nThis is achieved within a finite-range density functional formalism. The\nresults here presented, restricted to alkali metal substrates, illustrate the\nchange in meniscus shape from rather broad to narrow wedges on weak and strong\nalkali adsorbers, and relate this change to the wetting behavior of helium on\nthe corresponding planar substrate. As the wedge angle is varied, we find a\nsequence of stable states that, in the case of cesium, undergo one filling and\none emptying transition at large and small openings, respectively. A\ncomputationally unambiguous criterion to determine the contact angle of $^4$He\non cesium is also proposed.\n", "  In this article we show in details the derivation of an integration scheme\nfor the dissipative particle dynamic model (DPD) using the stochastic Trotter\nformula [De Fabritiis et al., Physica A, 361, 429 (2006)]. We explain some\nsubtleties due to the stochastic character of the equations and exploit\nanalyticity in some interesting parts of the dynamics. The DPD-Trotter\nintegrator demonstrates the inexistence of spurious spatial correlations in the\nradial distribution function for an ideal gas equation of state. We also\ncompare our numerical integrator to other available DPD integration schemes.\n", "  In this paper we analyze atom lasers based on the spatial modulation of the\nscattering length of a Bose-Einstein Condensate. We demonstrate, through\nnumerical simulations and approximate analytical methods, the controllable\nemission of matter-wave bursts and study the dependence of the process on the\nspatial dependence of the scattering length along the axis of emission. We also\nstudy the role of an additional modulation of the scattering length in time.\n", "  A spontaneous luminescence is reported when epoxy resin samples are heated in\nair. This phenomenon is very sensitive to the nature of the atmosphere. The\nsame treatment in nitrogen leads to an extinction of the luminescence. The\nemission process is restored when samples are kept for a sufficient time in\nair. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we have investigated the\nluminescence of the elementary constituents of the epoxy (resin and hardener)\nwhen heated in air and nitrogen, as well as during resin curing in the same\natmospheres. It appears that the emission process is linked with the presence\nof oxygen. Although the kinetics of the luminescence can differ depending on\nthe nature of the sample (cured resin, resin during curing, liquid components),\nthe emission spectra are the same during resin curing and upon heating of the\ncured resin and hardener. The emission spectrum of the base resin is different.\nIt is concluded that the light results from a chemiluminescence process during\noxidation.\n", "  We report on the realization of polariton quantum boxes in a semiconductor\nmicrocavity under strong coupling regime. The quantum boxes consist of mesas\nthat confine the cavity photon, etched on top of the spacer of a microcavity.\nFor mesas with sizes of the order of a few micron in width and nm in depth, we\nobserve quantization, caused by the lateral confinement, of the polariton modes\nin several peaks. We evidence the strong exciton-photon coupling regime through\na typical/clear anticrossing curve for each quantized level. Moreover the\ngrowth technique is of high quality, which opens the way for the conception of\nnew optoelectronic devices.\n", "  Within local-spin-density functional theory, we have investigated the\n`dissociation' of few-electron circular vertical semiconductor double quantum\nring artificial molecules at zero magnetic field as a function of inter-ring\ndistance. In a first step, the molecules are constituted by two identical\nquantum rings. When the rings are quantum mechanically strongly coupled, the\nelectronic states are substantially delocalized, and the addition energy\nspectra of the artificial molecule resemble those of a single quantum ring in\nthe few-electron limit. When the rings are quantum mechanically weakly coupled,\nthe electronic states in the molecule are substantially localized in one ring\nor the other, although the rings can be electrostatically coupled. The effect\nof a slight mismatch introduced in the molecules from nominally identical\nquantum wells, or from changes in the inner radius of the constituent rings,\ninduces localization by offsetting the energy levels in the quantum rings. This\nplays a crucial role in the appearance of the addition spectra as a function of\ncoupling strength particularly in the weak coupling limit.\n", "  Novel behavior of the critical current density $j_{c}$ of a regularly\nperforated superconducting film is found, as a function of applied magnetic\nfield $H$. Previously pronounced peaks of $j_{c}$ at matching fields were\nalways found to decrease with increasing $H$. Here we found a {\\it reversal of\nthis behavior} for particular geometrical parameters of the antidot lattice\nand/or temperature. This new phenomenon is due to a strong ``caging'' of\ninterstitial vortices between the pinned ones. We show that this vortex-vortex\ninteraction can be further tailored by an appropriate choice of the\nsuperconducting material, described by the Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa$.\nIn effective type-I samples we predict that the peaks in $j_{c}(H)$ at the\nmatching fields are transformed into a {\\it step-like behavior}.\n", "  We study by first-principles calculations the electro-mechanical response of\ncarbon nanoscrolls. We show that although they present a very similar behavior\nto carbon nanotubes for what concerns the axial deformation sensitivity, they\nexhibit a radial response upon charge injection which is up to one order of\nmagnitude larger. In association with their high stability, this behavior make\nthem a natural choice for a new class of very efficient nano-actuators.\n", "  In a recent preprint (cond-mat/0601398), D. Funfschilling and G. Ahlers\ndescribe a new effect, that they interpret as non-Boussinesq, in a convection\ncell working with ethane, near its critical point. They argue that such an\neffect could have spoiled the Chavanne {\\it et al.} (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 79}\n3648, 1997) results, and not the Niemela {\\it et al.} (Nature, {\\bf 404}, 837,\n2000) ones, which would explain the differences between these two experiments.\nWe show that:-i)Restricting the Chavanne's data to situations as far from the\ncritical point than the Niemela's one, the same discrepancy remains.-ii)The\nhelium data of Chavanne show no indication of the effect observed by D.\nFunfschilling and G. Ahlers.\n", "  We present and characterize an experimental system in which we achieve the\nintegration of an ultrahigh finesse optical cavity with a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC). The conceptually novel design of the apparatus for the\nproduction of BECs features nested vacuum chambers and an in-vacuo magnetic\ntransport configuration. It grants large scale spatial access to the BEC for\nsamples and probes via a modular and exchangeable \"science platform\". We are\nable to produce \\87Rb condensates of five million atoms and to output couple\ncontinuous atom lasers. The cavity is mounted on the science platform on top of\na vibration isolation system. The optical cavity works in the strong coupling\nregime of cavity quantum electrodynamics and serves as a quantum optical\ndetector for single atoms. This system enables us to study atom optics on a\nsingle particle level and to further develop the field of quantum atom optics.\nWe describe the technological modules and the operation of the combined BEC\ncavity apparatus. Its performance is characterized by single atom detection\nmeasurements for thermal and quantum degenerate atomic beams. The atom laser\nprovides a fast and controllable supply of atoms coupling with the cavity mode\nand allows for an efficient study of atom field interactions in the strong\ncoupling regime. Moreover, the high detection efficiency for quantum degenerate\natoms distinguishes the cavity as a sensitive and weakly invasive probe for\ncold atomic clouds.\n", "  The investigation of a sizable thermal enhancement of magnetization is put\nforward for uniaxial ferromagnetic nanoparticles that are placed in a rotating\nmagnetic field. We elucidate the nature of this phenomenon and evaluate the\nresonant frequency dependence of the induced magnetization. Moreover, we reveal\nthe role of magnetic dipolar interactions, point out potential applications and\nreason the feasibility of an experimental observation of this effect.\n", "  A wavefront solution for quantum (capacitively coupled) transmission lines\nwith charge discreteness (PRB {\\bf 64}, 235309 (2001)) is proposed for the\nfirst time. The nonlinearity of the system becomes deeply related to charge\ndiscreteness. The wavefront velocity is found to depend on a step discontinuity\non the (pseudo) flux variable, $f$, displaying allowed and forbidden regions\n(gaps), as a function of $f$. A preliminary study of the stability of the\nsolutions is presented. The dual transmission line hamiltonian is proposed and\nfinally, we find a connection with the (quantum) Toda lattice.\n", "  We study by means of molecular dynamics simulations of periodic shear cells,\nthe influence of particle shape on the global mechanical behavior of dense\ngranular media. Results at macro-mechanical level show that for large shear\ndeformation samples with elongated particles, independent of their initial\norientation, reach the same stationary value for both shear force and void\nratio. At the micro-mechanical level the stress, the fabric and the inertia\ntensors of the particles are used to study the evolution of the media. In the\ncase of isotropic particles the direction of the principal axis of the fabric\ntensor is aligned with the one of the principal stress, while for elongated\nparticles the fabric orientation is strongly dependent on the orientation of\nthe particles. The shear band width is shown to depend on the particle shape\ndue to the tendency of elongated particles to preferential orientations and\nless rotation.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study for the statistical properties of random\nvariables that describe the domain structure of a finite Ising chain with\nnearest-neighbor exchange interactions and free boundary conditions. By use of\nextensive combinatorics we succeed in obtaining the one-variable probability\nfunctions for (i) the number of domain walls, (ii) the number of up domains,\nand (iii) the number of spins in an up domain. The corresponding averages and\nvariances of these probability distributions are calculated and the limiting\ncase of an infinite chain is considered. Analyzing the averages and the\ntransition time between differing chain states at low temperatures, we also\nintroduce a criterion of the ferromagnetic-like behavior of a finite Ising\nchain. The results can be used to characterize magnetism in monatomic metal\nwires and atomic-scale memory devices.\n", "  We study analytically and numerically the overdamped, deterministic dynamics\nof a chain of {\\it charged}, interacting particles driven by a longitudinal\nalternating electric field and additionally interacting with a smooth ratchet\npotential. We derive the equations of motion, analyze the general properties of\ntheir solutions and find the drift criterion for chain motion. For ratchet\npotentials of the form of a double-sine and a phase-modulated sine it is\ndemonstrated that both, a so-called integer and fractional transport of the\nchain can occur. Explicit results for the directed chain transport for these\ntwo classes of ratchet potentials are presented.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations using Wang-Landau sampling are performed to study\nthree-dimensional chains of homopolymers on a lattice. We confirm the accuracy\nof the method by calculating the thermodynamic properties of this system. Our\nresults are in good agreement with those obtained using Metropolis importance\nsampling. This algorithm enables one to accurately simulate the usually hardly\naccessible low-temperature regions since it determines the density of states in\na single simulation.\n", "  A two-dimensional Yukawa liquid is studied using two different nonequilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulation methods. Shear viscosity values in the limit of\nsmall shear rates are reported for a wide range of Coulomb coupling parameter\nand screening length. At high shear rates it is demonstrated that this liquid\nexhibits shear thinning, i.e., the viscosity $\\eta$ diminishes with increasing\nshear rate. It is expected that two-dimensional dusty plasmas will exhibit this\neffect.\n", "  The statistical theory of certain complex wave interference phenomena, like\nthe statistical fluctuations of transmission and reflection of waves, is of\nconsiderable interest in many fields of physics. In this article we shall be\nmainly interested in those situations where the complexity derives from the\nquenched randomness of scattering potentials, as in the case of disordered\nconductors, or, more in general, disordered waveguides. In studies performed in\nsuch systems one has found remarkable statistical regularities, in the sense\nthat the probability distribution for various macroscopic quantities involves a\nrather small number of relevant physical parameters, while the rest of the\nmicroscopic details serves as mere \"scaffolding\". We shall review past work in\nwhich this feature was captured following a maximum-entropy approach, as well\nas later studies in which the existence of a limiting distribution, in the\nsense of a generalized central-limit theorem, has been actually demonstrated.\nWe then describe a microscopic potential model that was developed recently,\nwhich gives rise to a further generalization of the central-limit theorem and\nthus to a limiting macroscopic statistics.\n", "  We study defect modes of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice\nwith a localized defect within the framework of the one-dimensional\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. It is shown that for a significant range of\nparameters the defect modes can be accurately described by an expansion over\nWannier functions, whose envelope is governed by the coupled nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation with a delta-impurity. The stability of the defect\nmodes is verified by direct numerical simulations of the underlying\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with a periodic plus defect potentials. We also\ndiscuss possibilities of driving defect modes through the lattice and suggest\nideas for their experimental generation.\n", "  We report on the magneto-optical spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence of a\nset of wurtzite (Ga,Mn)N epilayers with a low Mn content, grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy. The sharpness of the absorption lines associated to the Mn$^{3+}$\ninternal transitions allows a precise study of its Zeeman effect in both\nFaraday and Voigt configurations. We obtain a good agreement if we assume a\ndynamical Jahn-Teller effect in the 3d$^{4}$ configuration of Mn, and we\ndetermine the parameters of the effective Hamiltonians describing the\n$^{5}T\\_{2}$ and $^{5}E$ levels, and those of the spin Hamiltonian in the\nground spin multiplet, from which the magnetization of the isolated ion can be\ncalculated. On layers grown on transparent substrates, transmission close to\nthe band gap, and the associated magnetic circular dichroism, reveal the\npresence of the giant Zeeman effect resulting from exchange interactions\nbetween the Mn$^{3+}$ ions and the carriers. The spin-hole interaction is found\nto be ferromagnetic.\n", "  This paper investigates a clustering instability of a freely falling granular\njet composed of 100 micron glass spheres. The granular flow out of a circular\nnozzle starts out spatially uniform and then, further downstream, breaks up\ninto well defined clusters. The role of air is investigated in this phenomenon\nby changing the ambient air pressure down to 1/5000th atm. An optical method is\nused that measures inhomogeneities in the flow in order to quantify the growth\nof the clusters. Clustering is observed down to the lowest pressure and the\npresence of air leads to larger drops but does not initiate the drop formation.\nThe analysis shows that the drop size is set by fluctuations on the order of\nthe size of the particles at the nozzle.\n", "  We have studied the relaxation dynamics of optically excited electrons in\nmolybdenum and rhodium by means of time resolved two-photon photoemission\nspectroscopy (TR-2PPE) and ab initio electron self-energy calculations\nperformed within the GW and GW+T approximations. Both theoretical approaches\nreproduce qualitatively the experimentally observed trends and differences in\nthe lifetimes of excited electrons in molybdenum and rhodium. For excitation\nenergies exceeding the Fermi energy by more than 1 eV, the GW+T theory yields\nlifetimes in quantitative agreement with the experimental results. As one of\nthe relevant mechanisms causing different excited state lifetime in Mo and Rh\nwe identify the occupation of the 4d bands. An increasing occupation of the 4d\nbands results in an efficient decrease of the lifetime even for rather small\nexcitation energies of a few 100 meV.\n", "  It is usual to think of Focal Conic Domains (FCD) as perfect geometric\nconstructions in which the layers are folded into Dupin cyclides, about an\nellipse and a hyperbola that are conjugate. This ideal picture is often far\nfrom reality. We have investigated in detail the FCDs in several materials that\nhave a transition from a smectic A (SmA) to a nematic phase (N). The ellipse\nand the hyperbola are seldom perfect, and the FCD textures also suffer large\ntransformations (in shape or/and in nature) when approaching the transition to\nthe nematic phase, or appear imperfect on cooling from the nematic phase. We\ninterpret these imperfections as due to the interaction of FCDs with\ndislocations. We analyze theoretically the general principles subtending the\ninteraction mechanisms between FCDs and finite Burgers vector dislocations,\nnamely the formation of \\textit{kinks} on disclinations, to which dislocations\nare attached, and we present models relating to some experimental results.\nWhereas the principles of the interactions are very general, their realizations\ncan differ widely in function of the boundary conditions.\n", "  An extensive experimental study of indentation and crack arrest statistics is\npresented for four different brittle materials (alumina, silicon carbide,\nsilicon nitride, glass). Evidence is given that the crack length statistics can\nbe described by a universal (i.e. material independent) distribution. The\nlatter directly derives from results obtained when modeling crack propagation\nas a depinning phenomenon. Crack arrest (or effective toughness) statistics\nappears to be fully characterized by two parameters, namely, an asymptotic\ncrack length (or macroscopic toughness) value and a power law size dependent\nwidth. The experimental knowledge of the crack arrest statistics at one given\nscale thus gives access to its knowledge at all scales.\n", "  We present an exhaustive analysis of the light-induced frequency shifts of\nthe photoassociation lines of ultracold metastable 4He* atoms in a magnetic\ntrap. The measurements of the shifts of several vibrational levels bound in the\npurely long-range J=1,0u+ potential linked to the 23S1-23P0 asymptote were\nreported in a previous paper and are analyzed here. The simplicity of this\nsystem makes it very appropriate for a detailed study. Indeed, the purely\nlong-range character of the excited potential allows one to calculate exact\nexcited molecular wavefunctions and to use asymptotic expansions at large\ninternuclear distances of the ground state wavefunctions appearing in\nFranck-Condon type integrals. Moreover, the number of collisional channels to\nbe considered is strongly reduced by the absence of hyperfine structure for\n4He* and the use of polarized ultracold atoms and polarized light. This allows\nus to derive semi-analytical expressions for the shifts showing explicitly\ntheir linear dependences on the s-wave scattering length a of spin polarized\nmetastable 4He* atoms. This explains how it is possible to derive the\nmeasurement of a from these shifts.\n", "  We investigate shear strength properties of wet granular materials in the\npendular state (i.e. the state where the liquid phase is discontinuous) as a\nfunction of water content. Sand and glass beads were wetted and tested in a\ndirect shear cell and under various confining pressures. In parallel, we\ncarried out three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations by using an\nexplicit equation expressing capillary force as a function of interparticle\ndistance, water bridge volume and surface tension. We show that, due to the\npeculiar features of capillary interactions, the major influence of water\ncontent over the shear strength stems from the distribution of liquid bonds.\nThis property results in shear strength saturation as a function of water\ncontent. We arrive at the same conclusion by a microscopic analysis of the\nshear strength. We propose a model that accounts for the capillary force, the\ngranular texture and particle size polydispersity. We find fairly good\nagreement of the theoretical estimate of the shear strength with both\nexperimental data and simulations. From numerical data, we analyze the\nconnectivity and anisotropy of different classes of liquid bonds according to\nthe sign and level of the normal force as well as the bond direction. We find\nthat weak compressive bonds are almost isotropically distributed whereas strong\ncompressive and tensile bonds have a pronounced anisotropy. The probability\ndistribution function of normal forces is exponentially decreasing for strong\ncompressive bonds, a decreasing power-law function over nearly one decade for\nweak compressive bonds and an increasing linear function in the range of\ntensile bonds. These features suggest that different bond classes do not play\nthe same role with respect to the shear strength.\n", "  We present a diagrammatic real-time approach to adiabatic pumping of\nelectrons through interacting quantum dots. Performing a systematic\nperturbation expansion in the tunnel-coupling strength, we compute the charge\npumped through a single-level quantum dot per pumping cycle. The combination of\nCoulomb interaction and quantum fluctuations, accounted for in contributions of\nhigher order in the tunnel coupling, modifies the pumping characteristics via\nan interaction-dependent renormalization of the quantum-dot level. The latter\nis even responsible for the {\\em dominant} contribution to the pumped charge\nwhen pumping via time-dependent tunnel-coupling strengths.\n", "  We consider the interference of two overlapping ideal Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. The usual description of this phenomenon involves the introduction\nof a so-called condensate wave functions having a definite phase. We\ninvestigate the origin of this phase and the theoretical basis of treating\ninterference. It is possible to construct a phase state, for which the particle\nnumber is uncertain, but phase is known. However, how one would prepare such a\nstate before an experiment is not obvious. We show that a phase can also arise\nfrom experiments using condensates in Fock states, that is, having known\nparticle numbers. Analysis of measurements in such states also gives us a\nprescription for preparing phase states. The connection of this procedure to\nquestions of ``spontaneously broken gauge symmetry'' and to ``hidden\nvariables'' is mentioned.\n", "  The flow of dry granular material in a half-filled rotating drum is studied.\nThe thickness of the flowing zone is measured for several rotation speeds, drum\nsizes and beads sizes (size ratio between drum and beads ranging from 47 to\n7400). Varying the rotation speed, a scaling law linking mean velocity vs\nthickness of the flow, $v\\sim h^m$, is deduced for each couple (beads, drum).\nThe obtained exponent $m$ is not always equal to 1, value previously reported\nin a drum, but varies with the geometry of the system. For small size ratios,\nexponents higher than 1 are obtained due to a saturation of the flowing zone\nthickness. The exponent of the power law decreases with the size ratio, leading\nto exponents lower than 1 for high size ratios. These exponents imply that the\nvelocity gradient of a dry granular flow in a rotating drum is not constant.\nMore fundamentally, these results show that the flow of a granular material in\na rotating drum is very sensible to the geometry, and that the deduction of the\n``rheology'' of a granular medium flowing in such a geometry is not obvious.\n", "  Additional variables (also often called ``hidden variables'') are sometimes\nadded to standard quantum mechanics in order to remove its indeterminism or\n``incompletness,'' and to make the measurement process look more classical.\nHere we discuss a case in which an additional variable arises almost\nspontaneously from the quantum formalism: the emergence of relative phase\nbetween two highly populated Fock state Bose-Einstein condensates. The model\nsimulated here involves the interference of two Bose condensates, one with all\nup spins, and the other with down spins, along a z-axis. With the clouds\noverlapping, we consider the results of measuring spins in a transverse plane\n(the general direction is studied in an appendix). The determination of the\npreviously ``hidden'' phase becomes progressively more definite as additional\nmeasurements are made. We also provide an analysis of a recent and closely\nrelated experiment.\n", "  We present our the construction of an atom interferometer for inertial\nsensing in microgravity, as part of the I.C.E. (\\textit{Interf\\'{e}rom\\'{e}trie\nCoh\\'{e}rente pour l'Espace}) collaboration. On-board laser systems have been\ndeveloped based on fibre-optic components, which are insensitive to mechanical\nvibrations and acoustic noise, have sub-MHz linewidth, and remain frequency\nstabilised for weeks at a time. A compact, transportable vacuum system has been\nbuilt, and used for laser cooling and magneto-optical trapping. We will use a\nmixture of quantum degenerate gases, bosonic $^{87}$Rb and fermionic $^{40}$K,\nin order to find the optimal conditions for precision and sensitivity of\ninertial measurements. Microgravity will be realised in parabolic flights\nlasting up to 20s in an Airbus. We show that the factors limiting the\nsensitivity of a long-interrogation-time atomic inertial sensor are the phase\nnoise in reference frequency generation for Raman-pulse atomic beam-splitters\nand acceleration fluctuations during free fall.\n", "  We report on the magnetic properties of Co$\\_x$Pt$\\_{1-x}$ clusters embedded\nin various matrices. Using a careful analysis of magnetization curves and ZFC\nsusceptibility measurements, we determine the clusters magnetic anisotropy\nenergy (MAE) and separate the surface and volume contributions. By comparing\ndifferent chemical compositions, we show that a small amount of Pt (15%)\ninduces an important increase in the volume anisotropy with respect to pure Co\nclusters, even in chemically disordered fcc clusters. Comparing the\nmeasurements of clusters embedded in Nb and MgO matrices, we show that the\noxide matrix induces an important increase of the surface MAE attributed to the\nformation of an antiferromagnetic CoO shell around the clusters.\n", "  We discuss a new approach to describe mesoscopic systems, based on the ideas\nof quantum electrical circuits with charge discreteness. This approach has\nallowed us to propose a simple alternative descriptions of some mesoscopic\nsystems, with interesting results for some mesoscopic systems. In his work, we\nshow that the application of the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules to the\nQuantum $LC$ circuit with discrete charge allows us to easily reproduce\nprevious results.\n", "  The interplay between Rashba, Dresselhaus and Zeeman interactions in a\nquantum well submitted to an external magnetic field is studied by means of an\naccurate analytical solution of the Hamiltonian, including electron-electron\ninteractions in a sum rule approach. This solution allows to discuss the\ninfluence of the spin-orbit coupling on some relevant quantities that have been\nmeasured in inelastic light scattering and electron-spin resonance experiments\non quantum wells. In particular, we have evaluated the spin-orbit contribution\nto the spin splitting of the Landau levels and to the splitting of charge- and\nspin-density excitations. We also discuss how the spin-orbit effects change if\nthe applied magnetic field is tilted with respect to the direction\nperpendicular to the quantum well.\n", "  The femtosecond magnetization dynamics of a thin cobalt film excited with\nultrashort laser pulses has been studied using two complementary pump-probe\ntechniques, namely spin-, energy- and time-resolved photoemission and\ntime-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. Combining the two methods it is\npossible to identify the microscopic electron spin-flip mechanisms responsible\nfor the ultrafast macroscopic magnetization dynamics of the cobalt film. In\nparticular, we show that electron-magnon excitation does not affect the overall\nmagnetization even though it is an efficient spin-flip channel on the sub-200\nfs timescale. Instead we find experimental evidence for the relevance of\nElliott-Yafet type spin-flip processes for the ultrafast demagnetization taking\nplace on a time scale of 300 fs.\n", "  Any state of matter is classified according to its order, and the kind of\norder a physical system can posses is profoundly affected by its\ndimensionality. Conventional long-range order, like in a ferromagnet or a\ncrystal, is common in three-dimensional (3D) systems at low temperature.\nHowever, in two-dimensional (2D) systems with a continuous symmetry, true\nlong-range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite\ntemperature. Consequently, in contrast to the 3D case, a uniform 2D fluid of\nidentical bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Nevertheless, it\ncan form a \"quasi-condensate\" and become superfluid below a finite critical\ntemperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory associates this\nphase transition with the emergence of a topological order, resulting from the\npairing of vortices with opposite circulations. Above the critical temperature,\nproliferation of unbound vortices is expected. Here we report the observation\nof a BKT-type crossover in a trapped quantum degenerate gas of rubidium atoms.\nUsing a matter wave heterodyning technique, we observe both the long-wavelength\nfluctuations of the quasi-condensate phase and the free vortices. At low\ntemperatures, the gas is quasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system\nsize. As the temperature is increased, the loss of long-range coherence\ncoincides with the onset of proliferation of free vortices. Our results provide\ndirect experimental evidence for the microscopic mechanism underlying the BKT\ntheory, and raise new questions regarding coherence and superfluidity in\nmesoscopic systems.\n", "  We demonstrate transport and evaporative cooling of several atomic clouds in\na chain of magnetic Ioffe-Pritchard traps moving at a low speed ($<1$~m/s). The\ntrapping scheme relies on the use of a magnetic guide for transverse\nconfinement and of magnets fixed on a conveyor belt for longitudinal trapping.\nThis experiment introduces a new approach for parallelizing the production of\nBose-Einstein condensates as well as for the realization of a continuous atom\nlaser.\n", "  In this present work, we report a structural and magnetic study of mixed\nCo58Pt42 clusters. MgO, Nb and Si matrix can be used to embed clusters,\navoiding any magnetic interactions between particles. Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy (TEM) observations show that Co58Pt42 supported isolated clusters\nare about 2nm in diameter and crystallized in the A1 fcc chemically disordered\nphase. Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and Grazing\nIncidence Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (GIWAXS) reveal that buried clusters\nconserve these properties, interaction with matrix atoms being limited to their\nfirst atomic layers. Considering that 60% of particle atoms are located at\nsurface, this interactions leads to a drastic change in magnetic properties\nwhich were investigated with conventional magnetometry and X-Ray Magnetic\nCircular Dichro\\\"{i}sm (XMCD). Magnetization and blocking temperature are\nweaker for clusters embedded in Nb than in MgO, and totally vanish in silicon\nas silicides are formed. Magnetic volume of clusters embedded in MgO is close\nto the crystallized volume determined by GIWAXS experiments. Cluster can be\nseen as a pure ferromagnetic CoPt crystallized core surrounded by a\ncluster-matrix mixed shell. The outer shell plays a predominant role in\nmagnetic properties, especially for clusters embedded in niobium which have a\nblocking temperature 3 times smaller than clusters embedded in MgO.\n", "  In this paper we treat the behavior of Bose Einstein condensates in double\nsquare well potentials, both of equal and different depths. For even depth,\nsymmetry preserving solutions to the relevant nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation is known, just as in the linear limit. When the nonlinearity is strong\nenough, symmetry breaking solutions also exist, side by side with the symmetric\none. Interestingly, solutions almost entirely localized in one of the wells are\nknown as an extreme case. Here we outline a method for obtaining all these\nsolutions for repulsive interactions. The bifurcation point at which, for\ncritical nonlinearity, the asymmetric solutions branch off from the symmetry\npreserving ones is found analytically. We also find this bifurcation point and\ntreat the solutions generally via a Josephson Junction model.\n  When the confining potential is in the form of two wells of different depth,\ninteresting new phenomena appear. This is true of both the occurrence of the\nbifurcation point for the static solutions, and also of the dynamics of phase\nand amplitude varying solutions. Again a generalization of the Josephson model\nproves useful. The stability of solutions is treated briefly.\n", "  We report Muon Spin Relaxation studies in weak transverse fields of the\nsuperconductivity in the metal cluster compound,\nGa$\\_{84}$[N(SiMe$\\_{3}$)$\\_{2}$]$\\_{20}$-Li$\\_{6}$Br$\\_{2}$(thf)$\\_{20}\\cdot\n$2toluene. The temperature and field dependence of the muon spin relaxation\nrate and Knight shift clearly evidence type II bulk superconductivity below\n$T\\_{\\text{c}}\\approx7.8$ K, with $B\\_{\\text{c1}}\\approx 0.06$ T,\n$B\\_{\\text{c2}}\\approx 0.26 $ T, $\\kappa\\sim 2$ and weak flux pinning. The data\nare well described by the s-wave BCS model with weak electron-phonon coupling\nin the clean limit. A qualitative explanation for the conduction mechanism in\nthis novel type of narrow band superconductor is presented.\n", "  It is shown that the critical properties of a recently studied model for\nnon-equilibrium wetting are robust if one extends the dynamic rules by\nsingle-particle diffusion on terraces of the wetting layer. Examining the\nbehavior at the critical point and along the phase transition line, we identify\na special point in the phase diagram where detailed balance of the dynamical\nprocesses is partially broken.\n", "  One usual way to strengthen a metal is to add alloying elements and to\ncontrol the size and the density of the precipitates obtained. However,\nprecipitation in multicomponent alloys can take complex pathways depending on\nthe relative diffusivity of solute atoms and on the relative driving forces\ninvolved. In Al-Zr-Sc alloys, atomic simulations based on first-principle\ncalculations combined with various complementary experimental approaches\nworking at different scales reveal a strongly inhomogeneous structure of the\nprecipitates: owing to the much faster diffusivity of Sc compared with Zr in\nthe solid solution, and to the absence of Zr and Sc diffusion inside the\nprecipitates, the precipitate core is mostly Sc-rich, whereas the external\nshell is Zr-rich. This explains previous observations of an enhanced nucleation\nrate in Al-Zr-Sc alloys compared with binary Al-Sc alloys, along with much\nhigher resistance to Ostwald ripening, two features of the utmost importance in\nthe field of light high-strength materials.\n", "  We present a theoretical interpretation of a recent experiment presented in\nref. \\cite{Zwierlein06} on the density profile of Fermi gases with unbalanced\nspin populations. We show that in the regime of strong interaction, the\nboundaries of the three phases observed in \\cite{Zwierlein06} can be\ncharacterized by two dimensionless numbers $\\eta\\_\\alpha$ and $\\eta\\_\\beta$.\nUsing a combination of a variational treatment and a study of the experimental\nresults, we infer rather precise bounds for these two parameters.\n", "  We have studied the possibly half metallic Co2FeSi full Heusler alloy by\nmeans of spin- and time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. For excitation,\nthe second and fourth harmonic of femtosecond Ti:sapphire lasers were used,\nwith photon energies of 3.1 eV and 5.9 eV, respectively. We compare the\ndependence of the measured surface spin polarization on the particular\nphotoemission mechanism, i.e. 1-photon-photoemission (1PPE) or 2-photon\nphotoemission (2PPE). The observed differences in the spin polarization can be\nexplained by a spin-dependent lifetime effect occurring in the 2-photon\nabsorption process. The difference in escape depth of the two methods in this\ncontext suggests that the observed reduction of spin polarization (compared to\nthe bulk) cannot be attributed just to the outermost surface layer but takes\nplace at least 4-6 nm away from the surface.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the 1D expansion of a coherent interacting\nmatterwave (a Bose-Einstein condensate) in the presence of disorder. A 1D\nrandom potential is created via laser speckle patterns. It is carefully\ncalibrated and the self-averaging properties of our experimental system are\ndiscussed. We observe the suppression of the transport of the BEC in the random\npotential. We discuss the scenario of disorder-induced trapping taking into\naccount the radial extension in our experimental 3D BEC and we compare our\nexperimental results with the theoretical predictions.\n", "  The recent experiment by Y. Shin \\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{93},\n160406 (2004)] on the decay of a doubly quantized vortex imprinted in $^{23}%\n$Na condensates is analyzed by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. Our results, which are in very good quantitative agreement with the\nexperiment, demonstrate that the vortex decay is mainly a consequence of\ndynamical instability. Despite apparent contradictions, the local density\napproach is consistent with the experimental results. The monotonic increase\nobserved in the vortex lifetimes is a consequence of the fact that, for large\ncondensates, the measured lifetimes incorporate the time it takes for the\ninitial perturbation to reach the central slice. When considered locally, the\nsplitting occurs approximately at the same time in every condensate, regardless\nof its size.\n", "  We present a thorough dielectric investigation of the hexagonal perovskites\nLa1.2Sr2.7IrO7.33 and La1.2Sr2.7RuO7.33 in a broad frequency and temperature\nrange, supplemented by additional infrared measurements. The occurrence of\ngiant dielectric constants up to 10^5 is revealed to be due to electrode\npolarization. Aside of dc and ac conductivity contributions, we detect two\nintrinsic relaxation processes that can be ascribed to ionic hopping between\ndifferent off-center positions. In both materials we find evidence for charge\ntransport via hopping of localized charge carriers. In the infrared region,\nthree phonon bands are detected, followed by several electronic excitations. In\naddition, these materials provide further examples for the occurrence of a\nsuperlinear power law in the broadband ac conductivity, which recently was\nproposed to be a universal feature of all disordered matter.\n", "  The effect of a high-frequency signal on the FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable model\nis analyzed. We show that the firing rate is diminished as the ratio of the\nhigh-frequency amplitude to its frequency is increased. Moreover, it is\ndemonstrated that the excitable character of the system, and consequently the\nfiring activity, is suppressed for ratios above a given threshold value. In\naddition, we show that the vibrational resonance phenomenon turns up for\nsufficiently large noise strength values.\n", "  We present ab initio calculations for single-atom vacancies in graphene. In\nagreement with earlier work, we find that vacancies are responsible for the\nmagnetism recently observed experimentally, creating a center with net spin.\nFor small supercells, there is a strong symmetry breaking in the supercell with\nrespect to the perfect graphene structure, and this symmetry breaking is much\nsmaller for larger supercells. The influence of the adsorption of H, O and N\natoms on the spin center of the bare single-atom vacancy and its influence on\nthe magnetism induced in these samples is investigated. A rich variety of\nmechanisms is found for the generation of magnetism in this system.\n", "  The field dependence of the vortex core size $\\xi(B)$ is incorporated in the\nLondon model, in order to describe reversible magnetization $M(B,T)$ for a\nnumber of materials with large Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\\kappa$. The\ndependence $\\xi(B)$ is directly related to deviations in $M(\\ln B)$ from linear\nbehavior prescribed by the standard London model. A simple method to extract\n$\\xi(B)$ from the magnetization data is proposed. For most materials examined,\n$\\xi(B)$ so obtained decreases with increasing field and is in qualitative\nagreement both with behavior extracted from $\\mu$SR and small angle neutron\nscattering data and with that predicted theoretically.\n", "  A design of subkelvin single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits with reduced power\ndissipation and additional cooling of shunt resistors for superconducting qubit\ncontrol circuits has been developed and characterized. We demonstrate operation\nof SFQ comparators with current resolution of 40 nA at 2 GHz sampling rate. Due\nto improved cooling the electron temperature in shunt resistors of a SFQ\ncomparator is below 50 mK when the bath temperature is about 30 mK.\n", "  A random fuse network, or equivalently a two-dimensional spring network with\nquenched disorder, is subjected to a constant load and thermal noise, and\nstudied by means of numerical simulations. Rupture is thermally activated and\nthe lifetime follows an Arrhenius law where the energy barrier is reduced by\ndisorder. Due to the non-homogeneous distribution of forces from the stress\nconcentration at microcrack tips, spatial correlations between rupture events\nappear, but they do not affect the energy barrier's dependence on the disorder;\nthey affect only the coupling between the disorder and the applied load.\n", "  We analyse photoionisation and ion detection as a means of accurately\ncounting ultra-cold atoms. We show that it is possible to count clouds\ncontaining many thousands of atoms with accuracies better than $N^{-1/2}$ with\ncurrent technology. This allows the direct probing of sub-Poissonian number\nstatistics of atomic samples. The scheme can also be used for efficient single\natom detection with high spatio-temporal resolution. All aspects of a realistic\ndetection scheme are considered, and we discuss experimental situations in\nwhich such a scheme could be implemented.\n", "  In this work we investigated the encapsulation of C$_20$ and C$_30$\nfullerenes into semiconducting carbon nanotubes to study the possibility of\nbandgap engineering in such systems. Classical molecular dynamics simulations\ncoupled to tight-binding calculations were used to determine the conformational\nand electronic properties of carbon nanotube supercells containing up to 12\nfullerenes. We have observed that C$_20$ fullerenes behave similarly to a\np-type dopant while C$_30$ ones work as n-type ones. For larger diameter\nnanotubes, where fullerene patterns start to differ from the linear\narrangements (peapods), the doping features are preserved for both fullerenes,\nbut local disorder plays an important role and significantly alters the\nelectronic structure. The combined incorporation of both fullerene types\n(hybrid encapsulation) into the same nanotube leads to a behavior similar to\nthat found in electronic junctions in Silicon-based electronic devices. These\naspects can be exploited in the design of nanoelectronic devices using\nsemiconducting carbon nanotubes.\n", "  We present transport measurements along the least conducting c direction of\nthe organic superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, performed under an accurately aligned\nmagnetic field in the low temperature regime. The experimental results reveal a\ntwo-dimensional confinement of the carriers in the (a,b) planes which is\ngoverned by the magnetic field component along the b' direction. This 2-D\nconfinement is accompanied by a metal-insulator transition for the c axis\nresistivity. These data are supported by a quantum mechanical calculation of\nthe transverse transport taking into account in self consistent treatment the\neffect of the field on the interplane Green function and on the intraplane\nscattering time.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and numerical study of the equilibrium\ncluster formation in globular protein solutions under no-added salt conditions.\nWe show that a cluster phase emerges as a result of a competition between a\nlong-range screened Coulomb repulsion and a short-range attraction. A simple\neffective potential, in which only depth and width of the attractive part of\nthe potential are optimized, accounts in a remarkable way for the wavevector\ndependence of the X-ray scattering structure factor.\n", "  A rather simple random walk model on a one-dimensional lattice is put\nforward. The lattice as a whole switches randomly between two possible states\nwhich are spatially symmetric. Both lattice states are identical, but\ntranslated by one site with respect to each other, and consist of infinite\narrays of absorbing sites separated by two non-absorbing sites. Exact explicit\nexpressions for the long-time velocity and the effective diffusion coefficient\nare obtained and discussed. In particular, it is shown that the direction of\nthe steady motion can be reversed by conveniently varying the values of either\nthe mean residence times in the lattice states or the transition rates to the\nabsorbing and non-absorbing sites.\n", "  We report the first realization of a guided quasicontinuous atom laser by rf\noutcoupling a Bose-Einstein condensate from a hybrid optomagnetic trap into a\nhorizontal atomic waveguide. This configuration allows us to cancel the\nacceleration due to gravity and keep the de Broglie wavelength constant at 0.5\n$\\mu$m during 0.1 s of propagation. We also show that our configuration,\nequivalent to pigtailing an optical fiber to a (photon) semiconductor laser,\nensures an intrinsically good transverse mode matching.\n", "  We propose that the inversion symmetry of the graphene honeycomb lattice is\nspontaneously broken via a magnetic field dependent Peierls distortion. This\nleads to valley splitting of the $n=0$ Landau level but not of the other Landau\nlevels. Compared to quantum Hall valley ferromagnetism recently discussed in\nthe literature, lattice distortion provides an alternative explanation to all\nthe currently observed quantum Hall plateaus in graphene.\n", "  The superconducting state of the heavy fermion PrOs4Sb12 is studied by heat\ntransport measure- ments on a highly homogeneous single crystal exhibiting only\none transition peak in the specific heat. The field and temperature dependence\nof the thermal conductivity confirm multiband super- conductivity and point to\nfully open gaps on the whole Fermi surface.\n", "  The structural, electronic and transport properties of metallocene molecules\n(MCp$_2$) and isolated or nanotube-encapsulated chains are studied by using a\ncombination of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions.\nThe analysis first discusses the whole series of isolated MCp$_2$ molecules,\nwhere M = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, and Os. The series presents a rich range\nof electronic and magnetic behaviors due to the interplay between the crystal\nfield interaction and Hund's rules, as the occupation of the $d$ shell\nincreases. The article then shows how many of these interesting properties can\nalso be seen when MCp$_2$ molecules are linked together to form periodic\nchains. It is argued that encapsulation of the chains inside carbon nanotubes,\nthat is exothermic for radii larger than 4.5 \\AA, provides the missing\nmechanical stability and electrical isolation. The structural stability, charge\ntransfer, magnetic and electronic behavior of the ensuing chains, as well as\nthe modification of the electrostatic potential in the nanotube wall produced\nby the metallocenes as thoroughly discussed. We argue that the full devices can\nbe characterized by two doped, strongly correlated Hubbard models whose mutual\nhybridization is almost negligible. The charge transferred from the chains\nproduces a strong modification of the electrostatic potential in the nanotube\nwalls, which is amplified in case of semiconducting and endothermic nanotubes.\nThe transport properties of isolated metallocenes between semi-infinite\nnanotubes are also analyzed and shown to lead to important changes in the\ntransmission coefficients of clean nanotubes for high energies.\n", "  Two trains of light pulses at periods that are equally shifted from the\nharmonics of a missing fundamental, are combined in a nonlinear crystal. As a\nresult of a noncollinear phase matched second order nonlinear generation, a new\ntrain of pulses is obtained. When the temporal width of the input pulses is\nlarge, the frequency of the resulting pulse train follows the observations from\nclassical experiments on the perception of virtual pitch by the brain. On the\nother hand, when the width of the input pulses is small, the generated pulse\ntrain exhibits much lower frequencies, analogous to those observed in the motor\nneural system. Our experimental set up allows us to explore, systematically and\ncontinuously, the transition between these two regimes, while at the same time\ndemonstrate that coincidence detection in quadratic nonlinear systems has\nfunctionalities similar to those observed in the nervous system.\n", "  The melting curve and fluid equation of state of carbon dioxide have been\ndetermined under high pressure in a resistively-heated diamond anvil cell. The\nmelting line was determined from room temperature up to $11.1\\pm0.1$ GPa and\n$800\\pm5$ K by visual observation of the solid-fluid equilibrium and in-situ\nmeasurements of pressure and temperature. Raman spectroscopy was used to\nidentify the solid phase in equilibrium with the melt, showing that solid I is\nthe stable phase along the melting curve in the probed range. Interferometric\nand Brillouin scattering experiments were conducted to determine the refractive\nindex and sound velocity of the fluid phase. A dispersion of the sound velocity\nbetween ultrasonic and Brillouin frequencies is evidenced and could be\nreproduced by postulating the presence of a thermal relaxation process. The\nBrillouin sound velocities were then transformed to thermodynamic values in\norder to calculate the equation of state of fluid CO$\\_2$. An analytic\nformulation of the density with respect to pressure and temperature is\nproposed, suitable in the $P-T$ range 0.1-8 GPa and 300-700 K and accurate\nwithin 2%. Our results show that the fluid above 500 K is less compressible\nthan predicted from various phenomenological models.\n", "  We study dynamical and thermal effects that are induced in nanoparticle\nsystems by a rotating magnetic field. Using the deterministic Landau-Lifshitz\nequation and appropriate rotating coordinate systems, we derive the equations\nthat characterize the steady-state precession of the nanoparticle magnetic\nmoments and study a stability criterion for this type of motion. On this basis,\nwe describe (i) the influence of the rotating field on the stability of the\nsmall-angle precession, (ii) the dynamical magnetization of nanoparticle\nsystems, and (iii) the switching of the magnetic moments under the action of\nthe rotating field. Using the backward Fokker-Planck equation, which\ncorresponds to the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz equation, we develop a method for\ncalculating the mean residence times that the driven magnetic moments dwell in\nthe up and down states. Within this framework, the features of the induced\nmagnetization and magnetic relaxation are elucidated.\n", "  We consider N atoms trapped in an isotropic harmonic potential, with s-wave\ninteractions of infinite scattering length. In the zero-range limit, we obtain\nseveral exact analytical results: mapping between the trapped problem and the\nfree-space zero-energy problem, separability in hyperspherical coordinates,\nSO(2,1) hidden symmetry, and relations between the moments of the trapping\npotential energy and the moments of the total energy.\n", "  We show how applying field conjugated to the order parameter, may act as a\nvery precise probe to explore the probability distribution function of the\norder parameter. Using this `magnetic-field scanning' on large-scale numerical\nsimulations of the critical 2D XY-model, we are able to discard the conjectured\ndouble-exponential form of the large-magnetization asymptote.\n", "  We have revisited the epitaxial growth modes of Fe on W(110) and Mo(110), and\npropose an overview or our contribution to the field. We show that the\nStranski-Krastanov growth mode, recognized for a long time in these systems, is\nin fact characterized by a bimodal distribution of islands for growth\ntemperature in the range 250-700&deg;C. We observe firstly compact islands\nwhose shape is determined by Wulff-Kaischev's theorem, secondly thin and flat\nislands that display a preferred height, ie independant from nominal thickness\nand deposition procedure (1.4nm for Mo, and 5.5nm for W on the average). We\nused this effect to fabricate self-organized arrays of nanometers-thick stripes\nby step decoration. Self-assembled nano-ties are also obtained for nucleation\nof the flat islands on Mo at fairly high temperature, ie 800&deg;C. Finally,\nusing interfacial layers and solid solutions we separate two effects on the\npreferred height, first that of the interfacial energy, second that of the\ncontinuously-varying lattice parameter of the growth surface.\n", "  Using {\\it ab initio} total energy density-functional theory calculations, we\ninvestigate the electronic, structural and magnetic properties of Manganese\ndoped Germanium nanowires. The nanowires have been constructed along the [110]\ndirection and the dangling bonds on the surface have been saturated by hydrogen\natoms. We observed that the Mn has lower formation energy at the center of the\nwire when compared to regions close to the surface. The Mn-Mn coupling has\nlower energy for a high-spin configuration except when they are first nearest\nneighbors. These results show that Ge:Mn nanowires are potential candidates for\nferromagnetic quasi-one dimentional systems.\n", "  The dynamic properties of the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY chain with the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction in a transverse field are investigated.\nUsing the Jordan-Wigner transformation, the dynamic structure factors of the\nmodel are evaluated rigorously (partially analytically and partially\nnumerically). The effects of the DM interaction on the frequency shapes of the\ndynamic structure factors are discussed.\n", "  A sensor for thermal and thermodynamic measurements of small magnetic systems\nhave been designed and built. It is based on a 5&mu;m-thick suspended polymer\nmembrane, which has a very low heat capacity (&asymp; 10-6 J/K at nitrogen\ntemperature), and on which a heater and a highly sensitive thermometer are\ndeposited. The sensor properties have been characterized as a function of\ntemperature and frequency. Energy exchanges as small as 1 picojoule (10-12\nJoule) were detected in the 40K- 300K temperature range. Such values correspond\nto those required for measuring the thermal signatures occurring during\nmagnetization reversal in very thin samples (typically 10 nm thick), which\nwould be deposited on the membrane. It is expected that this method will\nconstitute a powerful tool in view of analyzing magnetization reversal\nprocesses in magnetic nanosystems, e.g. exhibiting the exchange-spring and\nexchange-bias phenomena.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new molecular phase of carbon dioxide at\nhigh-pressure and high-temperature. Using x-ray diffraction, we identify this\nphase as the theoretically predicted high-temperature Cmca phase [Bonev et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett., 91, 065501 (2003)]. Its relation with phase III, on one hand,\nand its relative stability with respect to phase IV, on the other hand, are\ndiscussed based on spectroscopic and melting data. The existence of this\nstrictly molecular phase challenges the interpretation of phases IV and II as\nintermediate phases between the molecular and covalent-bonded forms of CO2.\n", "  We present a compact matrix formulation of the modularity, a commonly used\nquality measure for the community division in a network. Using this formulation\nwe calculate the density of modularities, a statistical measure of the\nprobability of finding a particular modularity for a random but valid community\ndivision into $C$ communities. We present our results for some well--known and\nsome artificial networks, and we conclude that the general features of the\nmodularity density are quite similar for the different networks. From a simple\nmodel of the modularity we conclude that all nnected networks must show similar\nshapes of their modularity densities. The general features of this density may\ngive valuable information in the search for good optimization schemes of the\nmodularity.\n", "  We present a non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study at the carbon\nK-edge on aligned poly[9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-fluorene-2,7-diyl] and show that\nthe x-ray Raman scattering technique can be used as a practical alternative to\nx-ray absorption measurements. We demonstrate that this novel method can be\napplied to studies on aligned $\\pi$-conjugated polymers complementing\ndiffraction and optical studies. Combining the experimental data and a very\nrecently proposed theoretical scheme we demonstrate a unique property of x-ray\nRaman scattering by performing the symmetry decomposition on the density of\nunoccupied electronic states into $s$- and $p$-type symmetry contributions.\n", "  The geometry of post mortem rough fracture surfaces of porous glass ceramics\nmade of sintered glass beads is shown experimentally to be self-affine with an\nexponent zeta=0.40 (0.04) remarkably lower than the 'universal' value zeta=0.8\nfrequently measured for many materials. This low value of zeta is similar to\nthat found for sandstone samples of similar micro structure and is also\npractically independent on the porosity phi in the range investigated (3% < phi\n< 26%) as well as on the bead diameter d and of the crack growth velocity. In\ncontrast, the roughness amplitude normalized by d increases linearly with phi\nwhile it is still independent, within experimental error, of d and of the crack\npropagation velocity. An interpretation of this variation is suggested in terms\nof a transition from transgranular to intergranular fracture propagation with\nno influence, however, on the exponent zeta.\n", "  We study the transport properties of model networks such as scale-free and\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi networks as well as a real network. We consider the\nconductance $G$ between two arbitrarily chosen nodes where each link has the\nsame unit resistance. Our theoretical analysis for scale-free networks predicts\na broad range of values of $G$, with a power-law tail distribution $\\Phi_{\\rm\nSF}(G)\\sim G^{-g_G}$, where $g_G=2\\lambda -1$, and $\\lambda$ is the decay\nexponent for the scale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our\npredictions by large scale simulations. The power-law tail in $\\Phi_{\\rm\nSF}(G)$ leads to large values of $G$, thereby significantly improving the\ntransport in scale-free networks, compared to Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi networks\nwhere the tail of the conductivity distribution decays exponentially. We\ndevelop a simple physical picture of the transport to account for the results.\nWe study another model for transport, the \\emph{max-flow} model, where\nconductance is defined as the number of link-independent paths between the two\nnodes, and find that a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the\nvalue of conductance are considered for both models, and some differences\nemerge. We then extend our study to the case of multiple sources, where the\ntransport is define between two \\emph{groups} of nodes. We find a fundamental\ndifference between the two forms of flow when considering the quality of the\ntransport with respect to the number of sources, and find an optimal number of\nsources, or users, for the max-flow case. A qualitative (and partially\nquantitative) explanation is also given.\n", "  We calculated the weak localization correction to the density of the\ntransmission eigenvalues in the case of chaotic quantum dots in the framework\nof Random Matrix Theory including the parametric dependence on the magnetic\nfield and spin-orbit coupling. The result is interpreted in terms of spin\nsinglet and triplet Cooperon modes of conventional diagrammatic perturbation\ntheory. As simple applications, we obtained the weak localization correction to\nthe conductance, the shot noise power and the third cumulant of the\ndistribution of the transmitted charge.\n", "  The random XORSAT problem deals with large random linear systems of Boolean\nvariables. The difficulty of such problems is controlled by the ratio of number\nof equations to number of variables. It is known that in some range of values\nof this parameter, the space of solutions breaks into many disconnected\nclusters. Here we study precisely the corresponding geometrical organization.\nIn particular, the distribution of distances between these clusters is computed\nby the cavity method. This allows to study the `x-satisfiability' threshold,\nthe critical density of equations where there exist two solutions at a given\ndistance.\n", "  We present the results of extensive computer simulations performed on\nsolutions of monodisperse charged rod-like polyelectrolytes in the presence of\ntrivalent counterions. To overcome energy barriers we used a combination of\nparallel tempering and hybrid Monte Carlo techniques. Our results show that for\nsmall values of the electrostatic interaction the solution mostly consists of\ndispersed single rods. The potential of mean force between the polyelectrolyte\nmonomers yields an attractive interaction at short distances. For a range of\nlarger values of the Bjerrum length, we find finite size polyelectrolyte\nbundles at thermodynamic equilibrium. Further increase of the Bjerrum length\neventually leads to phase separation and precipitation. We discuss the origin\nof the observed thermodynamic stability of the finite size aggregates.\n", "  Sintered samples of monoclinic zirconia (alpha-ZrO2) have been irradiated at\nroom temperature with 6.0-GeV Pb ions in the electronic slowing down regime.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) and micro-Raman spectroscopy measurements showed\nunambiguously that a transition to the 'metastable' tetragonal phase\n(beta-ZrO2) occurred at a fluence of 6.5x10^12 cm-2 for a large electronic\nstopping power value (approx 32.5 MeV $\\mu$m-1). At a lower fluence of\n1.0x10^12 cm-2, no such phase transformation was detected. The\nback-transformation from beta- to alpha-ZrO2 induced by isothermal or\nisochronal thermal annealing was followed by XRD analysis. The\nback-transformation started at an onset temperature around 500 K and was\ncompleted by 973 K. Plots of the residual tetragonal phase fraction deduced\nfrom XRD measurements versus annealing temperature or time are analyzed with\nfirst- or second-order kinetic models. An activation energy close to 1 eV for\nthe back-transformation process is derived either from isothermal annealing\ncurves, using the so-called \"cross-cut\" method, or from the isochronal\nannealing curve, using a second-order kinetic law. Correlation with the thermal\nrecovery of ion-induced paramagnetic centers monitored by EPR spectroscopy is\ndiscussed. Effects of crystallite size evolution and oxygen migration upon\nannealing are also addressed.\n", "  We perform traction experiments on viscous liquids highly confined between\nparallel plates, a geometry known as the probe-tack test in the adhesion\ncommunity. Direct observation during the experiment coupled to force\nmeasurement shows the existence of several mechanisms for releasing the stress.\nBubble nucleation and instantaneous growth had been observed in a previous\nwork. Upon increasing further the traction velocity or the viscosity, the\nbubble growth is progressively delayed. At high velocities, cracks at the\ninterface between the plate and the liquid appear before the bubbles have grown\nto their full size. Bubbles and cracks are thus observed concomitantly. At even\nhigher velocities, cracks develop fully so early that the bubbles are not even\nvisible. We present a theoretical model that describes these regimes, using a\nMaxwell fluid as a model for the actual fluid, a highly viscous silicon oil. We\npresent the resulting phase diagramme for the different force peak regimes. The\npredictions are compatible with the data. Our results show that in addition to\ncavitation, interfacial cracks are encountered in a probe-tack traction test\nwith viscoelastic, \\emph{liquid} materials and not solely with viscoelastic\nsolids like adhesives.\n", "  In this article we investigate the surface spin polarization in a 100 nm\nCo2Cr0.6Fe0.4Al (CCFA) film grown ex situ epitaxially on MgO(100) with a 10 nm\nFe buffer layer by means of spin resolved photoemission. We show that a careful\nin situ preparation of the sample surface leads to values for the room\ntemperature spin polarization up to 45% at the Fermi level. To our knowledge,\nthis is the highest value measured so far at the surface region of a full\nHeusler alloy at room temperature.\n", "  We investigate the interband transitions in several ensembles of\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots by using photoluminescence excitation\nspectroscopy under strong magnetic field. Well defined resonances are observed\nin the spectra. A strong anticrossing between two transitions is observed in\nall samples, which cannot be accounted for by a purely excitonic model. The\ncoupling between the mixed exciton-LO phonon states is calculated using the\nFr\\\"{o}hlich Hamiltonian. The excitonic polaron energies as well as the\noscillator strengths of the interband transitions are determined. An\nanticrossing is predicted when two exciton-LO phonon states have close enough\nenergies with phonon occupations which differ by one. A good agreement is found\nbetween the calculations and the experimental data evidencing the existence of\nexcitonic polarons.\n", "  We build a mean-field model of plasticity of amorphous solids, based on the\ndynamics of an ensemble shear transformation zones, interacting via intrinsic\ndynamical noise generated by the zone flips themselves. We compare the\nquasi-static, steady-state properties for two types of noise spectrum: (G)\nGaussian; (E) broad distribution derived from quadrupolar elastic interactions.\nWe find that the plastic flow proceeds via avalanches whose scaling properties\nwith system size are highly sensitive to noise tails. Comparison with available\ndata suggests that non-affine strain fields might be of paramount importance in\nthe small systems accessible to molecular simulations.\n", "  We review our studies of elastic lattices driven by an external force $F$ in\nthe presence of random disorder, which correspond to the case of vortices in\nsuperconducting thin films driven by external currents. Above a critical force\n$F_c$ we find two dynamical phase transitions at $F_p$ and $F_t$, with\n$F_c<F_p<F_t$. At $F_p$ there is a transition from plastic flow to smectic flow\nwhere the noise is isotropic and there is a peak in the differential\nresistance. At $F_t$ there is a sharp transition to a frozen transverse solid\nwhere both the transverse noise and the diffussion fall down abruptly and\ntherefore the vortex motion is localized in the transverse direction. From a\ngeneralized fluctuation-dissipation relation we calculate an effective\ntransverse temperature in the fluid moving phases. We find that the effective\ntemperature decreases with increasing driving force and becomes equal to the\nequilibrium melting temperature when the dynamic transverse freezing occurs.\n", "  We describe a recent experiment performed with rubidium atoms ($^{87}$Rb),\naiming at studying the coherence properties of a two-dimensional gas of bosonic\nparticles at low temperature. We have observed in particular a\nBerezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless (BKT) type crossover in the system, using a\nmatter wave heterodyning technique. At low temperatures, the gas is\nquasi-coherent on the length scale set by the system size. As the temperature\nis increased, the loss of long-range coherence coincides with the onset of the\nproliferation of free vortices, in agreement with the microscopic BKT theory.\n", "  Using the non-linear Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory, we obtain the possible\nvortex configurations in superconducting thin films containing a square lattice\nof antidots. The equilibrium structural phase diagram is constructed which\ngives the different ground-state vortex configurations as function of the size\nand periodicity of the antidots for a given effective GL parameter\n$\\kappa^{*}$. Giant-vortex states, combination of giant- and multi-vortex\nstates, as well as symmetry imposed vortex-antivortex states are found to be\nthe ground state for particular geometrical parameters of the sample. The\nantidot occupation number $n_o$ is calculated as a function of related\nparameters and comparison with existing expressions for the saturation number\n$n_s$ and with experimental results is given. For a small radius of antidots a\ntriangular vortex lattice is obtained, where some of the vortices are pinned by\nthe antidots and some of them are located between them. Transition between the\nsquare pinned and triangular vortex lattices is given for different values of\nthe applied field. The enhanced critical current at integer and rational\nmatching fields is found, where the level of enhancement at given magnetic\nfield directly depends on the vortex-occupation number of the antidots. For\ncertain parameters of the antidot lattice and/or temperature the critical\ncurrent is found to be larger for higher magnetic fields.\nSuperconducting/normal $H-T$ phase boundary exhibits different regimes as\nantidots are made larger, and we transit from a plain superconducting film to a\nthin-wire superconducting network. Presented results are in good agreement with\navailable experiments and suggest possible new experiments.\n", "  We have studied the magnetization reversal dynamics of FeNi/Al$\\_2$O$\\_3$/Co\nmagnetic tunnel junctions deposited on step-bunched Si substrates using\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect and time-resolved x-ray photoelectron emission\nmicroscopy combined with x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD-PEEM).\nDifferent reversal mechanisms have been found depending on the substrate miscut\nangle. Larger terraces (smaller miscut angles) lead to a higher nucleation\ndensity and stronger domain wall pinning. The width of domain walls with\nrespect to the size of the terraces seems to play an important role in the\nreversal. We used the element selectivity of XMCD-PEEM to reveal the strong\ninfluence of the stray field of domain walls in the hard magnetic layer on the\nmagnetic switching of the soft magnetic layer.\n", "  We report the observation of the cross-over between gravity and capillary\nwave turbulence on the surface of mercury. The probability density functions of\nthe turbulent wave height are found to be asymmetric and thus non Gaussian. The\nsurface wave height displays power-law spectra in both regimes. In the\ncapillary region, the exponent is in fair agreement with weak turbulence\ntheory. In the gravity region, it depends on the forcing parameters. This can\nbe related to the finite size of the container. In addition, the scaling of\nthose spectra with the mean energy flux is found in disagreement with weak\nturbulence theory for both regimes.\n", "  Motional narrowing refers to the striking phenomenon where the resonance line\nof a system coupled to a reservoir becomes narrower when increasing the\nreservoir fluctuation. A textbook example is found in nuclear magnetic\nresonance, where the fluctuating local magnetic fields created by randomly\noriented nuclear spins are averaged when the motion of the nuclei is thermally\nactivated. The existence of a motional narrowing effect in the optical response\nof semiconductor quantum dots remains so far unexplored. This effect may be\nimportant in this instance since the decoherence dynamics is a central issue\nfor the implementation of quantum information processing based on quantum dots.\nHere we report on the experimental evidence of motional narrowing in the\noptical spectrum of a semiconductor quantum dot broadened by the spectral\ndiffusion phenomenon. Surprisingly, motional narrowing is achieved when\ndecreasing incident power or temperature, in contrast with the standard\nphenomenology observed for nuclear magnetic resonance.\n", "  We demonstrate the combination of scanning force microscopy and scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy in a local probe microscope operating at very low\ntemperature (60 mK). This local probe uses a quartz tuning fork ensuring high\ntunnel junction stability. We performed the spatially-resolved spectroscopic\nstudy of a superconducting nano-circuit patterned on an insulating substrate.\nSignificant deviations from the BCS prediction are observed.\n", "  We present a comparative study of the excitations in bulk and liquid D2\nconfined within the pores of MCM-41. The material (Mobile Crystalline\nMaterial-41) is a silicate obtained by means of a template that yields a\npartially crystalline structure composed by arrays of nonintersecting hexagonal\nchannels of controlled width having walls made of amorphous SiO2. Its porosity\nwas characterized by means of adsorption isotherms and found to be composed by\na regular array of pores having a narrow distribution of sizes with a most\nprobable value of 2.45 nm. The assessment of the precise location of the sample\nwithin the pores is carried out by means of pressure isotherms. The study was\nconducted at two pressures which correspond to pore fillings above the\ncapillary condensation regime. Within the range of wave vectors where\ncollective excitations can be followed up (0.3<Q<3.0 $\\AA$&#8722;1), we found\nconfinement brings forward a large shortening of the excitation lifetimes that\nshifts the characteristic frequencies to higher energies. In addition, the\ncoherent quasielastic scattering shows signatures of reduced diffusivity.\n", "  Magnetic switching of a single molecular magnet (SMM) due to spin-polarized\ncurrent flowing between ferromagnetic metallic electrodes is investigated\ntheoretically. Magnetic moments of the electrodes are assumed to be collinear\nand parallel to the magnetic easy axis of the molecule. Electrons tunneling\nthrough a barrier between magnetic leads are coupled to the SMM via exchange\ninteraction. The current flowing through the system as well as the spin\nrelaxation times of the SMM are calculated from the Fermi golden rule. It is\nshown that spin of the SMM can be reversed by applying a voltage between the\ntwo magnetic electrodes. Moreover, the switching is reflected in the\ncorresponding current-voltage characteristics.\n", "  What is the complex impedance of a fully coherent quantum\nresistance-capacitance (RC) circuit at GHz frequencies in which a resistor and\na capacitor are connected in series? While Kirchhoff's laws predict addition of\ncapacitor and resistor impedances, we report on observation of a different\nbehavior. The resistance, here associated with charge relaxation, differs from\nthe usual transport resistance given by the Landauer formula. In particular,\nfor a single mode conductor, the charge relaxation resistance is half the\nresistance quantum, regardless of the transmission of the mode. The new\nmesoscopic effect reported here is relevant for the dynamical regime of all\nquantum devices.\n", "  We present a detailed structural investigation of the organic superconductor\n$\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Br at temperatures $T$ from 9 to 300 K.\nAnomalies in the $T$ dependence of the lattice parameters are associated with a\nglass-like transition previously reported at $T_g$ = 77 K. From structure\nrefinements at 9, 100 and 300 K, the orthorhombic crystalline symmetry, space\ngroup {\\it Pnma}, is established at all temperatures. Further, we extract the\n$T$ dependence of the occupation factor of the eclipsed conformation of the\nterminal ethylene groups of the BEDT-TTF molecule. At 300 K, we find 67(2) %,\nwith an increase to 97(3) % at 9 K. We conclude that the glass-like transition\nis not primarily caused by configurational freezing-out of the ethylene groups.\n", "  We review models for the nucleation of magnetisation reversal, i.e. the\nformation of a region of reversed magnetisation in an initially magnetically\nsaturated system. For small particles models for collective reversal, either\nuniform (Stoner-Wohlfarth model) or non-uniform like curling, provide good\nagreement between theory and experiment. For microscopic objects and thin\nfilms, we consider two models, uniform (Stoner-Wohlfarth) reversal inside a\nnucleation volume and a droplet model, where the free energy of an inverse\nbubble is calculated taking into account volume energy (Zeeman energy) and\nsurface tension (domain wall energy). In macroscopic systems, inhomogeneities\nin magnetic properties cause a distribution of energy barriers for nucleation,\nwhich strongly influences effects of temperature and applied field on\nmagnetisation reversal. For these systems, macroscopic material parameters like\nexchange interaction, spontaneous magnetisation and magnetic anisotropy can\ngive an indication of the magnetic coercivity, but exact values for nucleation\nfields are, in general, hard to predict.\n", "  We have investigated the dipole charge- and spin-density response of\nfew-electron two-dimensional concentric nanorings as a function of the\nintensity of a perpendicularly applied magnetic field. We show that the dipole\nresponse displays signatures associated with the localization of electron\nstates in the inner and outer ring favored by the perpendicularly applied\nmagnetic field. Electron localization produces a more fragmented spectrum due\nto the appearance of additional edge excitations in the inner and outer ring.\n", "  The two-dimensional backward Fokker-Planck equation is used to calculate the\nmean first-passage times (MFPTs) of the magnetic moment of a nanoparticle\ndriven by a rotating magnetic field. It is shown that a magnetic field that is\nrapidly rotating in the plane {\\it perpendicular} to the easy axis of the\nnanoparticle governs the MFPTs just in the same way as a static magnetic field\nthat is applied {\\it along} the easy axis. Within this framework, the features\nof the magnetic relaxation and net magnetization of systems composed of\nferromagnetic nanoparticles arising from the action of the rotating field are\nrevealed.\n", "  The existence of coherent quasiparticles near the Fermi energy in the low\ntemperature state of high-temperature superconductors has been well established\nby angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique directly\nprobes the momentum-resolved electronic excitation spectrum of the CuO$_2$\nplanes. We present a study of close to optimally doped\nLa$_{1.83}$Sr$_{0.17}$CuO$_4$ in the superconducting state and report an abrupt\nchange in the quasiparticle spectral function, as we follow the dispersion of\nthe ARPES signal from the Fermi energy up to 0.6 eV. The interruption in the\nquasiparticle dispersion separates coherent quasiparticle peaks at low energies\nfrom broad incoherent excitations at high energies. We find that the boundary\nbetween these low-energy and high-energy features exhibits a cosine-shaped\nmomentum dependence, reminiscent of the superconducting d-wave gap. Further\nintriguing similarities between characteristics of the incoherent excitations\nand quasiparticle properties (lifetime, Fermi arcs) suggest a close relation\nbetween the electronic response at high and low energies in cuprate\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We report on magnetoconductance measurements of metallic networks of various\nsizes ranging from 10 to $10^{6}$ plaquettes, with anisotropic aspect ratio.\nBoth Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak (AAS) $h/2e$ periodic oscillations and\nAharonov-Bohm (AB) $h/e$ periodic oscillations are observed for all networks.\nFor large samples, the amplitude of both oscillations results from the\nincoherent superposition of contributions of phase coherent regions. When the\ntransverse size becomes smaller than the phase coherent length $L_\\phi$, one\nenters a new regime which is phase coherent (mesoscopic) along one direction\nand macroscopic along the other, leading to a new size dependence of the\nquantum oscillations.\n", "  The pressure dependence of the interlayer magnetoresistance of the quasi-two\ndimensional organic metal beta''-(BEDT-TTF)4(NH4)[Fe(C2O4)3].DMF has been\ninvestigated up to 1 GPa in pulsed magnetic fields up to 55 T. The Shubnikov-de\nHaas oscillations spectra can be interpreted on the basis of three compensated\norbits in all the pressure range studied, suggesting that the Fermi surface\ntopology remains qualitatively the same as the applied pressure varies. In\naddition, all the observed frequencies, normalized to their value at ambient\npressure, exhibit the same sizeable pressure dependence. Despite this behavior,\nwhich is at variance with that of numerous charge transfer salts based on the\nBEDT-TTF molecule, non-monotonous pressure-induced variations of parameters\nsuch as the scattering rate linked to the various detected orbits are observed.\n", "  Using a Magnetic Resonance Force Microscope, we compare the ferromagnetic\nresonance spectra of individual micron-size disks with identical diameter, 1\n$m$m, but different layer structures. For a disk composed of a single 43.3 nm\nthick permalloy (Py) layer, the lowest energy mode in the perpendicular\nconfiguration is the uniform precession. The higher energy modes are standing\nspin-waves confined along the diameter of the disk. For a Cu(30)/Py(100)/Cu(30)\nnm multilayer structure, it has been interpreted that the lowest energy mode\nbecomes a precession localized at the Cu/Py interfaces. When the multilayer is\nchanged to Py(100)/Cu(10)/Py(10) nm, this localized mode of the thick layer is\ncoupled to the precession of the thin layer.\n", "  We calculate the light scattering spectrum of the anisotropic diffusion of\nimpurities (dye) in a compressible nematic solvent. We use a fluctuating\nhydrodynamic description when the system is in fully thermodynamic equilibrium\nand in a non-equilibrium steady state ($NESS$) induced by a dye-concentration\ngradient. We find that the equilibrium spectrum is symmetric (Lorentzian) with\nrespect to the frequency shifts, but anisotropic through its explicit\ndependence on the ratio of the parallel and normal diffusion coefficients of\nthe dye. The values of these coefficients were taken from experimental\nmeasurements of diffusion of methylred and nitrozo di-methyl aniline in a\n$MBBA$ solvent. We find that the compressibility of the solvent increases the\nmaximum and the width at half height of the Rayleigh peak, with respect to the\nincompressible case \\cite{suspension1}. This increase varies between 12% and\n25%, respectively, when the impurities concentrations is the range of 1% - 5%.\nThe $NESS$ induces a coupling between the concentration fluctuations of the dye\nand the hydrodynamic fluctuations of the solvent. In this case the\ncompressibility effects may increase the maximum and the width of the central\npeak up to $% 25%$, for values of the concentration gradient four orders of\nmagnitude smaller than those considered in the incompressible case. For the\nnonequilibrium Brillouin part of the spectrum we find that the intensities of\nthe sound propagation modes are unequal and one of the peaks shrinks in the\nsame amount as the other increases. This asymmetry increases linearly with the\nmagnitude of the solute concentration gradient. The maximum difference between\nthe nonequilibrium and equilibrium contributions to the Brillouin spectrum for\nvarious values of the external gradient is also estimated.\n", "  We calculate the short-range exchange-correlation energy of the uniform\nelectron gas with two modified electron-electron interactions. While the\nshort-range exchange functionals are calculated analytically, Coupled-Cluster\nand Fermi-hypernetted chain calculations are carried out for the correlation\nenergy and the results are fitted to an analytical parametrization. These data\nenable to construct the local density approximation corresponding to these\nmodified interactions.\n", "  We study transport properties such as electrical and frictionless flow\nconductance on scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks. We consider the conductance\nG between two arbitrarily chosen nodes where each link has the same unit\nresistance. Our theoretical analysis for scale-free networks predicts a broad\nrange of values of G, with a power-law tail distribution \\Phi_{SF}(G) \\sim\nG^{g_G}, where g_G = 2\\lambda - 1, where \\lambda is the decay exponent for the\nscale-free network degree distribution. We confirm our predictions by\nsimulations of scale-free networks solving the Kirchhoff equations for the\nconductance between a pair of nodes. The power-law tail in \\Phi_{SF}(G) leads\nto large values of G, thereby significantly improving the transport in\nscale-free networks, compared to Erdos-Renyi networks where the tail of the\nconductivity distribution decays exponentially. Based on a simple physical\n'transport backbone' picture we suggest that the conductances of scale-free and\nErdos-Renyi networks can be approximated by ck_Ak_B/(k_A+k_B) for any pair of\nnodes A and B with degrees k_A and k_B. Thus, a single quantity c, which\ndepends on the average degree <k> of the network, characterizes transport on\nboth scale-free and Erdos-Renyi networks. We determine that c tends to 1 for\nincreasing <k>, and it is larger for scale-free networks. We compare the\nelectrical results with a model for frictionless transport, where conductance\nis defined as the number of link-independent paths between A and B, and find\nthat a similar picture holds. The effects of distance on the value of\nconductance are considered for both models, and some differences emerge.\nFinally, we use a recent data set for the AS (autonomous system) level of the\nInternet and confirm that our results are valid in this real-world example.\n", "  The injection of electrons in the bulk of carbon nanotube which is connected\nto ideal Fermi liquid leads is considered. While the presence of the leads\ngives a cancellation of the noise cross-correlations, the auto-correlation\nnoise has a Fano factor which deviates strongly from the Schottky behavior at\nvoltages where finite size effects are expected. Indeed, as the voltage is\nincreased from zero, the noise is first super-poissonian, then sub-poissonian,\nand eventually it reaches the Schottky limit. These finite size effects are\nalso tested using a diagnosis of photo-assisted transport, where a small AC\nmodulation is superposed to the DC bias voltage between the injection tip and\nthe nanotube. When finite size effects are at play, we obtain a stepwise\nbehavior for the noise derivative, as expected for normal metal systems,\nwhereas in the absence of finite size effects, due to the presence of Coulomb\ninteractions, a smoothed staircase is observed. The present work shows that it\nis possible to explore finite size effects in nanotube transport via a zero\nfrequency noise measurement.\n", "  The role of spin polarized reservoirs in quantum tunneling of magnetization\nand relaxation processes in a single molecular magnet (SMM) is investigated\ntheoretically. The SMM is exchange-coupled to the reservoirs and also subjected\nto a magnetic field varying in time, which enables the quantum tunneling of\nmagnetization (QTM). The spin relaxation times are calculated from the Fermi\ngolden rule. The exchange interaction with tunneling electrons is shown to\naffect the spin reversal due to QTM. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nswitching is associated with transfer of a certain charge between the leads.\n", "  The investigation of the role of interactions in magnetic wire arrays is\ncomplex and often subject to strong simplifications. In this paper we obtained\nanalytical expressions for the magnetostatic interactions between wires and\ninvestigate the range of validity of dipole-dipole, first order and second\norder approximations. We also analyze the extension of the interwire\nmagnetostatic interactions in a sample and found that the number of wires\nrequired to reach energy convergence in the array strongly depends on the\nrelative magnetic orientation between the wires.\n", "  Using simple scaling arguments and two-dimensional numerical simulations of a\ngranular gas excited by vibrating one of the container boundaries, we study a\ndouble limit of small $1-r$ and large $L$, where $r$ is the restitution\ncoefficient and $L$ the size of the container. We show that if the particle\ndensity $n_0$ and $(1-r^2)(n_0 Ld)$ where $d$ is the particle diameter, are\nkept constant and small enough, the granular temperature, i.e. the mean value\nof the kinetic energy per particle, $<E >/N$, tends to a constant whereas the\nmean dissipated power per particle, $<D >/N$, decreases like $1/\\sqrt{N}$ when\n$N$ increases, provided that $(1-r^2)(n_0 Ld)^2 < 1$. The relative fluctuations\nof $E$, $D$ and the power injected by the moving boundary, $I$, have simple\nproperties in that regime. In addition, the granular temperature can be\ndetermined from the fluctuations of the power $I(t)$ injected by the moving\nboundary.}\n", "  A continuum description of granular flows would be of considerable help in\npredicting natural geophysical hazards or in designing industrial processes.\nHowever, the constitutive equations for dry granular flows, which govern how\nthe material moves under shear, are still a matter of debate. One difficulty is\nthat grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured\nfrom a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes,\nconstitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for\ncollisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows. However,\nthe intermediate dense regime, where the granular material flows like a liquid,\nstill lacks a unified view and has motivated many studies over the past decade.\nThe main characteristics of granular liquids are: a yield criterion (a critical\nshear stress below which flow is not possible) and a complex dependence on\nshear rate when flowing. In this sense, granular matter shares similarities\nwith classical visco-plastic fluids such as Bingham fluids. Here we propose a\nnew constitutive relation for dense granular flows, inspired by this analogy\nand recent numerical and experimental work. We then test our three-dimensional\n(3D) model through experiments on granular flows on a pile between rough\nsidewalls, in which a complex 3D flow pattern develops. We show that, without\nany fitting parameter, the model gives quantitative predictions for the flow\nshape and velocity profiles. Our results support the idea that a simple\nvisco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties, and\ncould serve as a basic tool for modelling more complex flows in geophysical or\nindustrial applications.\n", "  The crystallographic structure and magnetic properties of the La3Cu2VO9 were\ninvestigated by powder neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. The\ncompound materializes geometric frustration at two spatial scales, within\nclusters and between clusters, and at different temperature scales. It is shown\nby exactly solving the hamiltonian spectrum that collective spins are formed on\neach clusters at low temperature before inter-clusters coupling operates.\n", "  The development of microfluidic devices has recently revived the interest in\n\"old\" problems associated with transport at, or across, interfaces. As the\ncharacteristic sizes are decreased, the use of pressure gradients to transport\nfluids becomes problematic, and new, interface driven, methods must be\nconsidered. This has lead to new investigations of flow near interfaces, and to\nthe conception of interfaces engineered at various scales to reduce flow\nfriction. In this review, we discuss the present theoretical understanding of\nflow past solid interfaces at different length scales. We also briefly discuss\nthe corresponding phenomenon of heat transport, and the influence of surface\nslip on interface driven (e.g. electro-osmotic) flows.\n", "  We describe two-photon photoassociation (PA) experiments operated in an\nultracold gas of metastable $^4$He$^*$ atoms in the $2^3S_1$ state.\nAtom-molecule dark resonances as well as Raman signals provide information on\nthe exotic molecule in the least bound vibrational J=2, $v=14$ state of the\n$^5\\Sigma_g^+$ interaction potential of two spin-polarized metastable atoms.\nThe physical origin of the various two-photon PA signals is first discussed.\nTheir linewidths are interpreted in term of processes limiting the lifetime\n$\\tau$ of the exotic molecule. A value of $\\tau=1.4\\pm0.3 \\mu$s is found, which\nis discussed in view of two recent calculations of the Penning ionization rate\ninduced by spin-dipole coupling and of the atom-molecule inelastic collisions.\n", "  On site Raman analyses were performed at the Mus\\'{e}e national de\nC\\'{e}ramique, S\\`{e}vres, France, on rare Iznik (former Nicaea) pottery\nproduced from ~1480 to ~1620. A comparison is made with a series of shards. The\ntown of production of these potteries was highly disputed in the 80's and many\nquestions still remain. The potential of glaze on-site analyses as a\nclassification/datating tool is evaluated. The structure of the silicate glaze\ndoes not change with the sample (index of polymerisation ~ 0.5-0.8, indicating\na lead silicate composition; characteristic Si-O stretching mode doublet at\n\\~985 and 1030-1050 cm-1). By contrast the corresponding signature of most of\nthe \"K\\\"{u}tahya\" wares peaks at ~1070-1090 cm-1. The lowest index is measured\nfor a brilliant overglazed red bole, according to a lower temperature of\n(post)firing. The different crystalline phases identified in the glaze are\n&#61537;-quartz, haematite, spinel, cassiterite, uvarovite garnet and zircon.\nWhite colour arises from &#61537;-quartz slip in most samples studied.\nCassiterite (SnO2) opacifier is only present in some early blue-and-white\nceramics (Master of the Knots and Baba Nakkas style, ca. 1510-1530) and we do\nnot have other evidence of its intentional use as an opacifier. Intentional\naddition of tin oxide is likely for colour lightening in some red, blue and in\nclear green boles. At least two types of red glazes and two types of\nCr-containing green pigments are evidenced.\n", "  We experimentally investigated the decay behavior with time t of resonances\nnear and at exceptional points, where two complex eigenvalues and also the\nassociated eigenfunctions coalesce. The measurements were performed with a\ndissipative microwave billiard, whose shape depends on two parameters. The\nt^2-dependence predicted at the exceptional point on the basis of a two-state\nmatrix model could be verified. Outside the exceptional point the predicted\nRabi oscillations, also called quantum echoes in this context, were detected.\nTo our knowledge this is the first time that quantum echoes related to\nexceptional points were observed experimentally.\n", "  A concept of higher order neighborhood in complex networks, introduced\npreviously (PRE \\textbf{73}, 046101, (2006)), is systematically explored to\ninvestigate larger scale structures in complex networks. The basic idea is to\nconsider each higher order neighborhood as a network in itself, represented by\na corresponding adjacency matrix. Usual network indices are then used to\nevaluate the properties of each neighborhood. Results for a large number of\ntypical networks are presented and discussed. Further, the information from all\nneighborhoods is condensed in a single neighborhood matrix, which can be\nexplored for visualizing the neighborhood structure. On the basis of such\nrepresentation, a distance is introduced to compare, in a quantitative way, how\nfar apart networks are in the space of neighborhood matrices. The distance\ndepends both on the network topology and the adopted node numbering. Given a\npair of networks, a Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to find the best\nnumbering for one of them, holding fixed the numbering of the second network,\nobtaining a projection of the first one onto the pattern of the other. The\nminimal value found for the distance reflects differences in the neighborhood\nstructures of the two networks that arise from distinct topologies. Examples\nare worked out allowing for a quantitative comparison for distances among a set\nof distinct networks.\n", "  The problem of crossover from BCS to Bose-Einstein condensation has recently\nattracted considerable interest owing to the discovery of high-$T_{\\rm c}$\ncuprates. Their short coherence length, $\\xi$, places these materials in the\ninteresting region between BCS and Bose-Einstein condensation. In the paper of\nF. Pistolesi and G.C. Strinati (Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 49}, 6356 (1994)), the\nNozi\\`eres and Schmitt-Rink approach (NSR) is taken, which is valid for the\nweak coupling regime. They derive a relation between $T_{\\rm c}$ and $T_{\\rm\nF}$, which they insist is valid for any coupling strength. We present arguments\nthat their assumptions are incorrect by using our fully self-consistent\nT-matrix formalism in two dimensions, and show that the NSR approach produces\nunphysical results in this case.\n", "  A general and transparent procedure to bosonize fermions placed on a lattice\nis presented. Harmonics higher than $k_F$ are shown to appear in the\none-paticle Green function, due to the compact character of real electron\nbands. Quantitative estimations of the role of these higher harmonics are made\npossible by the bosonization technique presented here.\n", "  The critical exponents for a class of one-dimensional models of interface\ndepinning in disordered media can be calculated through a mapping onto directed\npercolation (DP). In higher dimensions these models give rise to directed\nsurfaces, which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class.\nWe formulate a scaling theory of directed surfaces, and calculate critical\nexponents numerically, using a cellular automaton that locates the directed\nsurfaces without making reference to the dynamics of the underlying interface\ngrowth models.\n", "  The ballistic conductance through a device consisting of quantum wires, to\nwhich two stubs are attached laterally, is calculated assuming parabolic\nconfining potentials of frequencies $\\omega_w$ for the wires and $\\omega_s$ for\nthe stubs. As a function of the ratio $\\omega_w/\\omega_s$ the conductance shows\nnearly periodic minima associated with quasibound states forming in the stubbed\nregion. Applying a magnetic field B normal to the plane of the device changes\nthe symmetry of the wavefunctions with respect to the center of the wires and\nleads to new quasibound states in the stubs. The presence of the magnetic field\ncan also lead to a second kind of state, trapped mainly in the wires by the\ncorners of the confining potentials, that yields conductance minima as well. In\neither case, these bound states form for weak B and strong confining\nfrequencies and thus are not edge states. Finally, we show experimental\nevidence for the presence of these quasi-bound states.\n", "  We consider thermal evolution of the spectral function A(Omega, T) in\nunderdoped cuprates at T >Tc. We find that in the strong coupling limit, the\nfermionic Green's function near (0,\\pi) behaves as G^{-1} (Omega) ~\n\\sqrt{Omega} in the whole frequency range relevant to photoemission\nexperiments.\n  The analysis of the pairing problem with this form of G yields a leading edge\ngap in A(\\Omega) and a broad maximum at larger frequencies. We find that\nclassical fluctuations predominantly add a frequency independent term to G^{-1}\n(Omega). This term destroys the leading edge gap at T =T* (k)$which has a\nmaximum value of about 200K near (0,\\pi).\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of the formation of three dimensional\n(pyramidal) structures in a large range of conditions, including the possible\nevaporation of adatoms from the surface and the presence of surface defects. We\ncompare our computer simulations to theoretical calculations of the growth and\nfind good agreement between them. This work clarifies precedent studies of\nthree dimensional growth and predicts the island size distributions obtained in\nthe different regimes. Finally, we show how our analysis can be used to\ninterpret experimental data.\n", "  Thin films are usually obtained by depositing atoms with a continuous flux.\nWe show that using a chopped flux changes the growth and the morphology of the\nfilm. A simple scaling analysis predicts how the island densities change as a\nfunction of the frequency of the chopped flux in simple cases where aggregation\nis irreversible. These predictions are confirmed by computer simulations. We\nshow that the model can be used to obtain information on the diffusion or the\nevaporation of the adatoms. The model is also useful to understand the growth\nof thin films prepared by pulsed sources.\n", "  Depuis une trentaine d'ann\\'{e}es, les ing\\'{e}nieurs utilisent couramment\ndes analogies avec l'\\'{e}volution naturelle pour optimiser des dispositifs\ntechniques.

More often that\nnot, these \"genetic\" or \"evolutionary\" methods are only view as efficient\ntools, which could replace other optimization techniques (gradient methods,\nsimplex, ...). In this paper, we try to show that sciences, techniques, human\norganizations, and more generally all complex systems, obey to evolution rules,\nwhose the genetic is a good representative model, even if genes and chromosomes\nare \"virtual\". Thus, the genetic representation is not only a specific tool\nhelping for the design of technological solutions, but also a global and\ndynamic model for the action of the human agitation on our world.\n", "  In a recent series of communications we have shown that the reordering\nproblem of bosons leads to certain combinatorial structures. These structures\nmay be associated with a certain graphical description. In this paper, we show\nthat there is a Hopf Algebra structure associated with this problem which is,\nin a certain sense, unique.\n", "  We consider the effects of network topology on the optimality of packet\nrouting quantified by $\\gamma_c$, the rate of packet insertion beyond which\ncongestion and queue growth occurs. The key result of this paper is to show\nthat for any network, there exists an absolute upper bound, expressed in terms\nof vertex separators, for the scaling of $\\gamma_c$ with network size $N$,\nirrespective of the routing algorithm used. We then derive an estimate to this\nupper bound for scale-free networks, and introduce a novel static routing\nprotocol which is superior to shortest path routing under intense packet\ninsertion rates.\n", "  Active polarimetric imagery is a powerful tool for accessing the information\npresent in a scene. Indeed, the polarimetric images obtained can reveal\npolarizing properties of the objects that are not avalaible using conventional\nimaging systems. However, when coherent light is used to illuminate the scene,\nthe images are degraded by speckle noise. The polarization properties of a\nscene are characterized by the degree of polarization. In standard polarimetric\nimagery system, four intensity images are needed to estimate this degree . If\nwe assume the uncorrelation of the measurements, this number can be decreased\nto two images using the Orthogonal State Contrast Image (OSCI). However, this\napproach appears too restrictive in some cases. We thus propose in this paper a\nnew statistical parametric method to estimate the degree of polarization\nassuming correlated measurements with only two intensity images. The estimators\nobtained from four images, from the OSCI and from the proposed method, are\ncompared using simulated polarimetric data degraded by speckle noise.\n", "  We construct a three parameter deformation of the Hopf algebra\n$\\mathbf{LDIAG}$. This new algebra is a true Hopf deformation which reduces to\n$\\mathbf{LDIAG}$ on one hand and to $\\mathbf{MQSym}$ on the other, relating\n$\\mathbf{LDIAG}$ to other Hopf algebras of interest in contemporary physics.\nFurther, its product law reproduces that of the algebra of polyzeta functions.\n", "  Scalar fields non--minimally coupled to (2+1)-gravity, in the presence of\ncosmological constant term, are considered. Non-minimal couplings are described\nby the term $\\zeta R \\Psi^2$ in the Lagrangian. Within a class of static\ncircularly symmetric space-times, it is shown that the only existing physically\nrelevant solutions are the anti-de Sitter space-time for $\\zeta=0$, and the\nMartinez-Zanelli black hole for $\\zeta=1/8$. We obtain also two new solutions\nwith non-trivial scalar field, for $\\zeta=1/6$ and $\\zeta=1/8$ respectively,\nnevertheless, the corresponding space-times can be reduced, via coordinate\ntransformations, to the standard anti-de Sitter space.\n", "  We investigate spherically symmetric and static gravitational fields\nrepresenting black hole configurations in the framework of metric-affine gauge\ntheories of gravity (MAG) in the presence of different matter fields. It is\nshown that in the triplet ansatz sector of MAG, black hole configurations in\nthe presence of non-Abelian matter fields allow the existence of black hole\nhair. We analyze several cases of matter fields characterized by the presence\nof hair and for all of them we show the validity of the no short hair\nconjecture.\n", "  We provide an in depth study of the theoretical peculiarities that arise in\neffective negative mass lensing, both for the case of a point mass lens and\nsource, and for extended source situations. We describe novel observational\nsignatures arising in the case of a source lensed by a negative mass. We show\nthat a negative mass lens produces total or partial eclipse of the source in\nthe umbra region and also show that the usual Shapiro time delay is replaced\nwith an equivalent time gain. We describe these features both theoretically, as\nwell as through numerical simulations. We provide negative mass microlensing\nsimulations for various intensity profiles and discuss the differences between\nthem. The light curves for microlensing events are presented and contrasted\nwith those due to lensing produced by normal matter. Presence or absence of\nthese features in the observed microlensing events can shed light on the\nexistence of natural wormholes in the Universe.\n", "  We re-examine the Lem\\^aitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions with a dust source\nadmitting symmetry centers. We consider as free parameters of the solutions the\ninitial value functions: $Y_i$, $\\rho_i$ and $\\Ri$, obtained by restricting the\ncurvature radius, $Y\\equiv \\sqrt{g_{\\theta\\theta}}$, the rest mass density,\n$\\rho$, and the 3-dimensional Ricci scalar of the rest frames, $\\R$, to an\narbitrary regular Cauchy hypersurface, $\\Ti$, marked by constant cosmic time\n($t=t_i$). Using $Y_i$ to fix the radial coordinate and the topology\n(homeomorphic class) of $\\Ti$, and scaling the time evolution in terms of an\nadimensional scale factor $y=Y/Y_i$, we show that the dynamics, regularity\nconditions and geometric features of the models are determined by $\\rho_i$,\n$\\Ri$ and by suitably constructed volume averages and contrast functions\nexpressible in terms of invariant scalars defined in $\\Ti$. These quantities\nlead to a straightforward characterization of initial conditions in terms of\nthe nature of the inhomogeneity of $\\Ti$, as density and/or curvature\noverdensities (``lumps'') and underdensities (''voids'') around a symmetry\ncenter. In general, only models with initial density and curvature lumps evolve\nwithout shell crossing singularities, though special classes of initial\nconditions, associated with a simmultaneous big bang, allow for a regular\nevolution for initial density and curvature voids. Specific restrictions are\nfound so that a regular evolution for $t>t_i$ is possible for initial voids. A\nstep-by-step guideline is provided for using the new variables in the\nconstruction of LTB models and for plotting all relevant quantities.\n", "  We demonstrate how the solution to an exterior Dirichlet boundary value\nproblem of the axisymmetric, stationary Einstein equations can be found in\nterms of generalized solutions of the Backlund type. The proof that this\ngeneralization procedure is valid is given, which also proves conjectures about\nearlier representations of the gravitational field corresponding to rotating\ndisks of dust in terms of Backlund type solutions.\n", "  A framework based on an extension of Kaluza's original idea of using a five\ndimensional space to unify gravity with electromagnetism is used to analyze\nMaxwell\\'{}s field equations. The extension consists in the use of a six\ndimensional space in which all equations of electromagnetism may be obtained\nusing only Einstein's field equation. Two major advantages of this approach to\nelectromagnetism are discussed, a full symmetric derivation for the wave\nequations for the potentials and a natural inclusion of magnetic monopoles\nwithout using any argument based on singularities.\n", "  We prove that given a solution of the Einstein equations $g_{ab}$ for the\nmatter field $T_{ab}$, an autoparallel null vector field $l^{a}$ and a solution\n$(l_{a}l_{c}, \\mathcal{T}_{ac})$ of the linearized Einstein equation on the\ngiven background, the Kerr-Schild metric $g_{ac}+\\lambda l_{a}l_{c}$ ($\\lambda\n$ arbitrary constant) is an exact solution of the Einstein equation for the\nenergy-momentum tensor $T_{ac}+\\lambda \\mathcal{T}_{ac}+\\lambda\n^{2}l_{(a}\\mathcal{T}_{c)b}l^{b}$. The mixed form of the Einstein equation for\nKerr-Schild metrics with autoparallel null congruence is also linear. Some more\ntechnical conditions hold when the null congruence is not autoparallel. These\nresults generalize previous theorems for vacuum due to Xanthopoulos and for\nflat seed space-time due to G\\\"{u}rses and G\\\"{u}rsey.\n", "  Both the static and homogeneous metrics describing the spherically symmetric\ngravitational field of a crossflow of incoming and outgoing null dust streams\nare generalized for the case of the two-component ghost radiation. Static\nsolutions represent either naked singularities or the wormholes recently found\nby Hayward. The critical value of the parameter separating the two\npossibilities is given. The wormhole is allowed to have positive mass. The\nhomogeneous solutions are open universes.\n", "  A pair of wave equations is presented for the gravitational and\nelectromagnetic perturbations of a charged black hole. One of the equations is\nuncoupled and determines the propagation of the electromagnetic perturbation.\nThe other is for the propagation of the shear of a principal null direction and\nhas a source term given by the solution of the first equation. This result is\nexpected to have important applications in astrophysical models.\n", "  It is often the case in numerical relativity that schemes that are known to\nbe convergent for well posed systems are used in evolutions of weakly\nhyperbolic (WH) formulations of Einstein's equations. Here we explicitly show\nthat with several of the discretizations that have been used through out the\nyears, this procedure leads to non-convergent schemes. That is, arbitrarily\nsmall initial errors are amplified without bound when resolution is increased,\nindependently of the amount of numerical dissipation introduced. The lack of\nconvergence introduced by this instability can be particularly subtle, in the\nsense that it can be missed by several convergence tests, especially in 3+1\ndimensional codes. We propose tests and methods to analyze convergence that may\nhelp detect these situations.\n", "  The slow-rotation approximation of Hartle is developed to a setting where a\ncharged rotating fluid is present. The linearized Einstein-Maxwell equations\nare solved on the background of the Reissner-Nordstrom space-time in the\nexterior electrovacuum region. The theory is put to action for the charged\ngeneralization of the Wahlquist solution found by Garcia. The Garcia solution\nis transformed to coordinates suitable for the matching and expanded in powers\nof the angular velocity. The two domains are then matched along the zero\npressure surface using the Darmois-Israel procedure. We prove a theorem to the\neffect that the exterior region is asymptotically flat if and only if the\nparameter C_{2}, characterizing the magnitude of an external magnetic field,\nvanishes. We obtain the form of the constant C_{2} for the Garcia solution. We\nconjecture that the Garcia metric cannot be matched to an asymptotically flat\nexterior electrovacuum region even to first order in the angular velocity. This\nconjecture is supported by a high precision numerical analysis.\n", "  We define and study a new kind of relation between two diffeomorphic\nLorentzian manifolds called {\\em causal relation}, which is any diffeomorphism\ncharacterized by mapping every causal vector of the first manifold onto a\ncausal vector of the second. We perform a thorough study of the mathematical\nproperties of causal relations and prove in particular that two given\nLorentzian manifolds (say $V$ and $W$) may be causally related only in one\ndirection (say from $V$ to $W$, but not from $W$ to $V$). This leads us to the\nconcept of causally equivalent (or {\\em isocausal} in short) Lorentzian\nmanifolds as those mutually causally related. This concept is more general and\nof a more basic nature than the conformal relationship, because we prove the\nremarkable result that a conformal relation $\\f$ is characterized by the fact\nof being a causal relation of the {\\em particular} kind in which both $\\f$ and\n$\\f^{-1}$ are causal relations. For isocausal Lorentzian manifolds there are\none-to-one correspondences, which sometimes are non-trivial, between several\nclasses of their respective future (and past) objects. A more important feature\nof isocausal Lorentzian manifolds is that they satisfy the same causality\nconstraints. This indicates that the causal equivalence provides a possible\ncharacterization of the {\\it basic causal structure}, in the sense of mutual\ncausal compatibility, for Lorentzian manifolds. Thus, we introduce a partial\norder for the equivalence classes of isocausal Lorentzian manifolds providing a\nclassification of spacetimes in terms of their causal properties, and a\nclassification of all the causal structures that a given fixed manifold can\nhave. A full abstract inside the paper.\n", "  We shall investigate $D$-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes in which all of\nthe scalar invariants constructed from the Riemann tensor and its covariant\nderivatives are zero. These spacetimes are higher-dimensional generalizations\nof $D$-dimensional pp-wave spacetimes, which have been of interest recently in\nthe context of string theory in curved backgrounds in higher dimensions.\n", "  We study the gravitational radiation reaction in compact binary systems\ncomposed of neutron stars with spin and huge magnetic dipole moments\n(magnetars). The magnetic dipole moments undergo a precessional motion about\nthe respective spins. At sufficiently high values of the magnetic dipole\nmoments, their interaction generates second post-Newtonian order contributions\nboth to the equations of motion and to the gravitational radiation escaping the\nsystem. We parametrize the radial motion and average over a radial period in\norder to find the secular contributions to the energy and magnitude of the\norbital angular momentum losses, in the generic case of \\textit{eccentric}\norbits. Similarly as for the spin-orbit, spin-spin, quadrupole-monopole\ninteractions, here too we deduce the secular evolution of the relative\norientations of the orbital angular momentum and spins. These equations,\nsupplemented by the evolution equations for the angles characterizing the\norientation of the dipole moments form a first order differential system, which\nis closed. The circular orbit limit of the energy loss agrees with Ioka and\nTaniguchi's earlier result.\n", "  We fully develop the concept of causal symmetry introduced in Class. Quant.\nGrav. 20 (2003) L139. A causal symmetry is a transformation of a Lorentzian\nmanifold (V,g) which maps every future-directed vector onto a future-directed\nvector. We prove that the set of all causal symmetries is not a group under the\nusual composition operation but a submonoid of the diffeomorphism group of V.\nTherefore, the infinitesimal generating vector fields of causal symmetries\n--causal motions-- are associated to local one-parameter groups of\ntransformations which are causal symmetries only for positive values of the\nparameter --one-parameter submonoids of causal symmetries--. The pull-back of\nthe metric under each causal symmetry results in a new rank-2 future tensor,\nand we prove that there is always a set of null directions canonical to the\ncausal symmetry. As a result of this it makes sense to classify causal\nsymmetries according to the number of independent canonical null directions.\nThis classification is maintained at the infinitesimal level where we find the\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a vector field to be a causal motion.\nThey involve the Lie derivatives of the metric tensor and of the canonical null\ndirections. In addition, we prove a stability property of these equations under\nthe repeated application of the Lie operator. Monotonicity properties,\nconstants of motion and conserved currents can be defined or built using casual\nmotions. Some illustrative examples are presented.\n", "  A homogeneous, Kantowski-Sachs type, bouncing brane-world universe is\npresented. The bulk has a positive cosmological constant and the Killing\nalgebra $so(1,3)\\oplus so(3)$. The totality of the source terms of the\neffective Einstein equation combine to a solid with different radial and\ntangential pressures.\n", "  Classical solutions of the spherically symmetric Nordstr\\\"{o}m-Vlasov system\nare shown to exist globally in time. The main motivation for investigating the\nmathematical properties of the Nordstr\\\"{o}m-Vlasov system is its relation to\nthe Einstein-Vlasov system. The former is not a physically correct model, but\nit is expected to capture some of the typical features of the latter, which\nconstitutes a physically satisfactory, relativistic model but is mathematically\nmuch more complex. We show that classical solutions of the spherically\nsymmetric Nordstr\\\"{o}m-Vlasov system exist globally in time for compactly\nsupported initial data under the additional condition that there is a lower\nbound on the modulus of the angular momentum of the initial particle system. We\nemphasize that this is not a smallness condition and that our result holds for\narbitrary large initial data satisfying this hypothesis.\n", "  In this work we present a mathematical model for the mechanical response of\nthe Brazilian Mario SCHENBERG gravitational wave (GW) detector to such waves.\nWe found the physical parameters that are involved in this response assuming a\nlinear elastic theory. Adopting this approach we determined the system's\nresonance frequencies for the case when six $i$-mode mechanical resonators are\ncoupled to the antenna surface according to the arrangement suggested by\nJohnson and Merkowitz: the truncated icosahedron configuration. This\nconfiguration presents special symmetries that allow for the derivation of an\nanalytic expression for the mode channels, which can be experimentally\nmonitored and which are directly related to the tensorial components of the GW.\nUsing this model we simulated how the system behaves under a gravitational\nsinewave quadrupolar force and found the relative amplitudes that result from\nthis excitation. The mechanical resonators made the signal $\\approx 5340$ times\nstronger. We found $i+1$ degenerate triplets plus $i$ non-degenerate system\nmode resonances within a band around ${3.17-3.24\\rm{kHz}}$ that are sensitive\nto signals higher than ${\\tilde h\\sim 10^{-22}\\rm{Hz}^{-1/2}}$ when we\nconsiderate the effects of thermal noise only.\n", "  In this paper we consider nonlinear interaction between gravitational and\nelectromagnetic waves in a strongly magnetized plasma. More specifically, we\ninvestigate the propagation of gravitational waves with the direction of\npropagation perpendicular to a background magnetic field, and the coupling to\ncompressional Alfv\\'{e}n waves. The gravitational waves are considered in the\nhigh frequency limit and the plasma is modelled by a multifluid description. We\nmake a self-consistent, weakly nonlinear analysis of the Einstein-Maxwell\nsystem and derive a wave equation for the coupled gravitational and\nelectromagnetic wave modes. A WKB-approximation is then applied and as a result\nwe obtain the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the slowly varying wave\namplitudes. The analysis is extended to 3D wave pulses, and we discuss the\napplications to radiation generated from pulsar binary mergers. It turns out\nthat the electromagnetic radiation from a binary merger should experience a\nfocusing effect, that in principle could be detected.\n", "  We give a surface integral derivation of the leading-order evolution\nequations for the spin and energy of a relativistic body interacting with other\nbodies in the post-Newtonian expansion scheme. The bodies can be arbitrarily\nshaped and can be strongly self-gravitating. The effects of all mass and\ncurrent multipoles are taken into account. As part of the computation one of\nthe 2PN potentials parametrizing the metric is obtained. The formulae obtained\nhere for spin and energy evolution coincide with those obtained by Damour,\nSoffel and Xu for the case of weakly self-gravitating bodies. By combining an\nEinstein-Infeld-Hoffman-type surface integral approach with multipolar\nexpansions we extend the domain of validity of these evolution equations to a\nwide class of strongly self-gravitating bodies. This paper completes in a\nself-contained way a previous work by Racine and Flanagan on translational\nequations of motion for compact objects.\n", "  The Stephani universes that can be interpreted as an ideal gas evolving in\nlocal thermal equilibrium are determined. Five classes of thermodynamic schemes\nare admissible, which give rise to five classes of regular models and three\nclasses of singular models. No Stephani universes exist representing an exact\nsolution to a classical ideal gas (one for which the internal energy is\nproportional to the temperature). But some Stephani universes may approximate a\nclassical ideal gas at first order in the temperature: all of them are\nobtained. Finally, some features about the physical behavior of the models are\npointed out.\n", "  When constructing general relativity (GR), Einstein required 4D general\ncovariance. In contrast, we derive GR (in the compact, without boundary case)\nas a theory of evolving 3-dimensional conformal Riemannian geometries obtained\nby imposing two general principles: 1) time is derived from change; 2) motion\nand size are relative. We write down an explicit action based on them. We\nobtain not only GR in the CMC gauge, in its Hamiltonian 3 + 1 reformulation but\nalso all the equations used in York's conformal technique for solving the\ninitial-value problem. This shows that the independent gravitational degrees of\nfreedom obtained by York do not arise from a gauge fixing but from hitherto\nunrecognized fundamental symmetry principles. They can therefore be identified\nas the long-sought Hamiltonian physical gravitational degrees of freedom.\n", "  In all dimensions and arbitrary signature, we demonstrate the existence of a\nnew local potential -- a double (2,3)-form -- for the Weyl curvature tensor,\nand more generally for all tensors with the symmetry properties of the Weyl\ncurvature tensor. The classical four-dimensional Lanczos potential for a Weyl\ntensor -- a double (2,1)-form -- is proven to be a particular case of the new\npotential: its double dual.\n", "  We consider premetric electrodynamics with a local and linear constitutive\nlaw for the vacuum. Within this framework, we find quartic Fresnel wave\nsurfaces for the propagation of light. If we require vanishing birefringence in\nvacuum, then a Riemannian light cone is implied. No proper Finslerian structure\ncan occur. This is generalized to dynamical equations of any order.\n", "  It is investigated the behaviour of the ``constants'' $G,$ $c$ and $\\Lambda $\nin the framework of a perfect fluid LRS Bianchi I cosmological model. It has\nbeen taken into account the effects of a $c-$variable into the curvature\ntensor. Two exact cosmological solutions are investigated, arriving to the\nconclusion that if $q<0$ (deceleration parameter) then $G,$ $c$ are growing\nfunctions on time $t$ while $\\Lambda $ is a negative decreasing function on\ntime.\n", "  We study a full causal bulk viscous cosmological model with flat FRW\nsymmetries and where the ``constants'' $G,c$ and $\\Lambda $ vary. We take into\naccount the possible effects of a $c-$variable into the curvature tensor in\norder to outline the field equations. Using the Lie method we find the possible\nforms of the ``constants'' $G$ and $c$ that make integrable the field equations\nas well as the equation of state for the viscous parameter. It is found that\n$G,c$ and $\\Lambda $ follow a power law solution verifying the relationship\n$G/c^{2}=\\kappa .$ Once these possible forms have been obtained we calculate\nthe thermodynamical quantities of the model in order to determine the possible\nvalues of the parameters that govern the quantities, finding that only a\ngrowing $G$ and $c$ are possible while $% \\Lambda $ behaves as a negative\ndecreasing function.\n", "  We give an up-to-date perspective with a general overview of the theory of\ncausal properties, the derived causal structures, their classification and\napplications, and the definition and construction of causal boundaries and of\ncausal symmetries, mostly for Lorentzian manifolds but also in more abstract\nsettings.\n", "  The matched filtering technique is used to search for gravitational wave\nsignals of a known form in the data taken by ground-based detectors. However,\nthe analyzed data contains a number of artifacts arising from various\nbroad-band transients (glitches) of instrumental or environmental origin which\ncan appear with high signal-to-noise ratio on the matched filtering output.\nThis paper describes several techniques to discriminate genuine events from the\nfalse ones, based on our knowledge of the signals we look for. Starting with\nthe $\\chi^2$ discriminator, we show how it may be optimized for free\nparameters. We then introduce several alternative vetoing statistics and\ndiscuss their performance using data from the GEO600 detector.\n", "  We review the theory of stationary black hole solutions of vacuum Einstein\nequations.\n", "  We investigate Lorentzian spacetimes where all zeroth and first order\ncurvature invariants vanish and discuss how this class differs from the one\nwhere all curvature invariants vanish (VSI). We show that for VSI spacetimes\nall components of the Riemann tensor and its derivatives up to some fixed order\ncan be made arbitrarily small. We discuss this in more detail by way of\nexamples.\n", "  The general metric for conformally flat stationary cyclic symmetric\nnoncircular spacetimes is explicitly given. In spite of the complexity\nintroduced by the inclusion of noncircular contributions, the related metric is\nderived via the full integration of the conformal flatness constraints. It is\nalso shown that the conditions for the existence of a rotation axis\n(axisymmetry) are the same ones which restrict the above class of spacetimes to\nbe static. As a consequence, a known theorem by Collinson is just part of a\nmore general result: any conformally flat stationary cyclic symmetric\nspacetime, even a noncircular one, is additionally axisymmetric if and only if\nit is also static. Since recent astrophysical motivations point in the\ndirection of considering noncircular configurations to describe magnetized\nneutron stars, the above results seem to be relevant in this context.\n", "  We consider anew some puzzling aspects of the equivalence of the quantum\nfield theoretical description of Bremsstrahlung from the inertial and\naccelerated observer's perspectives. More concretely, we focus on the seemingly\nparadoxical situation that arises when noting that the radiating source is in\nthermal equilibrium with the thermal state of the quantum field in the wedge in\nwhich it is located, and thus its presence does not change there the state of\nthe field, while it clearly does not affect the state of the field on the\nopposite wedge. How then is the state of the quantum field on the future wedge\nchanged, as it must in order to account for the changed energy momentum tensor\nthere? This and related issues are carefully discussed.\n", "  It has been shown that in the context of General Relativity (GR) enriched\nwith a new set of discrete symmetry reversal conjugate metrics, negative energy\nstates can be rehabilitated while avoiding the well-known instability issues.\nWe review here some cosmological implications of the model and confront them\nwith the supernovae and CMB data. The predicted flat universe constantly\naccelerated expansion phase is found to be in rather good agreement with the\nmost recent cosmological data.\n", "  4 emitters broadcasting an increasing electromagnetic signal generate a\nsystem of relativistic coordinates for the space-time, called emission\ncoordinates. Their physical realization requires an apparatus similar to the\none of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Several relativistic\ncorrections are utilized for the current precisions, but the GNSS are conceived\nas classical (Newtonian) systems, which has deep implications in the way of\noperating them. The study of emission coordinates is an essential step in order\nto develop a fully relativistic theory of positioning systems. This talk\npresents some properties of emission coordinates. In particular, we\ncharacterize how any observer sees a configuration of satellites giving a\ndegenerated system and show that the trajectories of the satellites select a\nunique privileged observer at each point and, for any observer, a set of 3\northogonal spatial axes.\n", "  A relativistic positioning system is a physical realization of a coordinate\nsystem consisting in four clocks in arbitrary motion broadcasting their proper\ntimes. The basic elements of the relativistic positioning systems are presented\nin the two-dimensional case. This simplified approach allows to explain and to\nanalyze the properties and interest of these new systems. The positioning\nsystem defined by geodesic emitters in flat metric is developed in detail. The\ninformation that the data generated by a relativistic positioning system give\non the space-time metric interval is analyzed, and the interest of these\nresults in gravimetry is pointed out.\n", "  We present a general study about the relation between the vorticity tensor\nand the Poynting vector of the electromagnetic field for axially symmetric\nstationary electrovacuum metrics. The obtained expressions allow to understand\nthe role of the Poynting vector in the dragging of inertial frames. The\nparticular case of the rotating massive charged magnetic dipole is analyzed in\ndetail. In addition, the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor are\ncalculated and the link between the later and the vorticity is established.\nThen we show that, in the vacuum case, the necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the vanishing of the magnetic part is that the spacetime be static.\n", "  Presented is a description of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter\nestimation routine for use with interferometric gravitational radiational data\nin searches for binary neutron star inspiral signals. Five parameters\nassociated with the inspiral can be estimated, and summary statistics are\nproduced. Advanced MCMC methods were implemented, including importance\nresampling and prior distributions based on detection probability, in order to\nincrease the efficiency of the code. An example is presented from an\napplication using realistic, albeit fictitious, data.\n", "  Recently Kordas (1995, Class. Quantum Grav. 12 2037) and Meinel and\nNeugebauer (1995, Class. Quantum Grav. 12 2045) studied the conditions for\nreflection symmetry in stationary axisymmetric space--times in vacuum. They\nfound that a solution to the Einstein field equations is reflectionally\nsymmetric if their Ernst's potential ${\\cal E}(\\rho=0,z)= e(z)$ on a portion of\nthe positive z-axis extending to infinity satisfies the condition\n$e_{+}(z){e}_{+}^{*}(-z)=1$. In this note, we formulate an analogous conditions\nfor two complex Ernst potentials in electrovacuum. We also present the special\ncase of rational axis potentials.\n", "  Maartens {\\it et al.}\\@ gave a covariant characterization, in a 1+3 formalism\nbased on a perfect fluid's velocity, of the parts of the first derivatives of\nthe curvature tensor in general relativity which are ``locally free'', i.e. not\npointwise determined by the fluid energy momentum and its derivative. The full\ndecomposition of independent curvature derivative components given in earlier\nwork on the spinor approach to the equivalence problem enables analogous\ngeneral results to be stated for any order: the independent matter terms can\nalso be characterized. Explicit relations between the two sets of results are\nobtained. The 24 Maartens {\\it et al.} locally free data are shown to\ncorrespond to the $\\nabla \\Psi$ quantities in the spinor approach, and the\nfluid terms are similarly related to the remaining 16 independent quantities in\nthe first derivatives of the curvature.\n", "  This paper introduces some general properties of the gravitational metric and\nthe natural basis of vectors and covectors in 4-dimensional emission\ncoordinates. Emission coordinates are a class of space-time coordinates defined\nand generated by 4 emitters (satellites) broadcasting their proper time by\nmeans of electromagnetic signals. They are a constitutive ingredient of the\nsimplest conceivable relativistic positioning systems. Their study is aimed to\ndevelop a theory of these positioning systems, based on the framework and\nconcepts of general relativity, as opposed to introducing `relativistic\neffects' in a classical framework. In particular, we characterize the causal\ncharacter of the coordinate vectors, covectors and 2-planes, which are of an\nunusual type. We obtain the inequality conditions for the contravariant metric\nto be Lorentzian, and the non-trivial and unexpected identities satisfied by\nthe angles formed by each pair of natural vectors. We also prove that the\nmetric can be naturally split in such a way that there appear 2 parameters\n(scalar functions) dependent exclusively on the trajectory of the emitters,\nhence independent of the time broadcast, and 4 parameters, one for each\nemitter, scaling linearly with the time broadcast by the corresponding\nsatellite, hence independent of the others.\n", "  The basic elements of the relativistic positioning systems in a\ntwo-dimensional space-time have been introduced in a previous work [Phys. Rev.\nD {\\bf 73}, 084017 (2006)] where geodesic positioning systems, constituted by\ntwo geodesic emitters, have been considered in a flat space-time. Here, we want\nto show in what precise senses positioning systems allow to make {\\em\nrelativistic gravimetry}. For this purpose, we consider stationary positioning\nsystems, constituted by two uniformly accelerated emitters separated by a\nconstant distance, in two different situations: absence of gravitational field\n(Minkowski plane) and presence of a gravitational mass (Schwarzschild plane).\nThe physical coordinate system constituted by the electromagnetic signals\nbroadcasting the proper time of the emitters are the so called {\\em emission\ncoordinates}, and we show that, in such emission coordinates, the trajectories\nof the emitters in both situations, absence and presence of a gravitational\nfield, are identical. The interesting point is that, in spite of this fact,\nparticular additional information on the system or on the user allows not only\nto distinguish both space-times, but also to complete the dynamical description\nof emitters and user and even to measure the mass of the gravitational field.\nThe precise information under which these dynamical and gravimetric results may\nbe obtained is carefully pointed out.\n", "  The non-abelian generalization of the Born-Infeld non-linear lagrangian is\nextended to the non-commutative geometry of matrices on a manifold. In this\ncase not only the usual SU(n) gauge fields appear, but also a natural\ngeneralization of the multiplet of scalar Higgs fields, with the double-well\npotential as a first approximation. The matrix realization of non-commutative\ngeometry provides a natural framework in which the notion of a determinant can\nbe easily generalized and used as the lowest-order term in a gravitational\nlagrangian of a new kind. As a result, we obtain a Born-Infeld-like lagrangian\nas a root of sufficiently high order of a combination of metric, gauge\npotentials and the scalar field interactions. We then analyze the behavior of\ncosmological models based on this lagrangian. It leads to primordial inflation\nwith varying speed, with possibility of early deceleration ruled by the\nrelative strength of the Higgs field.\n", "  A characterisation of initial data sets for the Schwarzschild spacetime is\nprovided. This characterisation is obtained by performing a 3+1 decomposition\nof a certain invariant characterisation of the Schwarzschild spacetime given in\nterms of concomitants of the Weyl tensor. This procedure renders a set of\nnecessary conditions --which can be written in terms of the electric and\nmagnetic parts of the Weyl tensor and their concomitants-- for an initial data\nset to be a Schwarzschild initial data set. Our approach also provides a\nformula for a static Killing initial data set candidate --a KID candidate.\nSufficient conditions for an initial data set to be a Schwarzschild initial\ndata set are obtained by supplementing the necessary conditions with the\nrequirement that the initial data set possesses a stationary Killing initial\ndata set of the form given by our KID candidate. Thus, we obtain an algorithmic\nprocedure of checking whether a given initial data set is Schwarzschildean or\nnot.\n", "  We study the appearance of multiple solutions to certain decompositions of\nEinstein's constraint equations. Pfeiffer and York recently reported the\nexistence of two branches of solutions for identical background data in the\nextended conformal thin-sandwich decomposition. We show that the Hamiltonian\nconstraint alone, when expressed in a certain way, admits two branches of\nsolutions with properties very similar to those found by Pfeiffer and York. We\nconstruct these two branches analytically for a constant-density star in\nspherical symmetry, but argue that this behavior is more general. In the case\nof the Hamiltonian constraint this non-uniqueness is well known to be related\nto the sign of one particular term, and we argue that the extended conformal\nthin-sandwich equations contain a similar term that causes the breakdown of\nuniqueness.\n", "  Considering charged fluid spheres as anisotropic sources and the diffusion\nlimit as the transport mechanism, we suppose that the inner space--time admits\nself--similarity. Matching the interior solution with the\nReissner--Nordstr\\\"om--Vaidya exterior one, we find an extremely compact and\noscillatory final state with a redistribution of the electric charge function\nand non zero pressure profiles.\n", "  In the present work, we quantize a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker model in\nthe presence of a positive cosmological constant and radiation. It gives rise\nto a Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale factor which has the form of a\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation for a potential with a barrier. We solve it\nnumerically and determine the tunneling probability for the birth of a\nasymptotically DeSitter, inflationary universe, initially, as a function of the\nmean energy of the initial wave-function. Then, we verify that the tunneling\nprobability increases with the cosmological constant, for a fixed value of the\nmean energy of the initial wave-function. Our treatment of the problem is more\ngeneral than previous ones, based on the WKB approximation. That is the case\nbecause we take into account the fact that the scale factor ($a$) cannot be\nsmaller than zero. It means that, one has to introduce an infinity potential\nwall at $a = 0$, which forces any wave-packet to be zero there. That condition\nintroduces new results, in comparison with previous works.\n", "  Currently the most popular method to evolve black-hole binaries is the\n``moving puncture'' method. It has recently been shown that when puncture\ninitial data for a Schwarzschild black hole are evolved using this method, the\nnumerical slices quickly lose contact with the second asymptotically flat end,\nand end instead on a cylinder of finite Schwarzschild coordinate radius. These\nslices are stationary, meaning that their geometry does not evolve further. We\nwill describe these results in the context of maximal slices, and present\ntime-independent puncture-like data for the Schwarzschild spacetime.\n", "  The influence of the observed relict vacuum energy on the fluctuations of\nCMBR going through cosmological matter condensations is studied in the\nframework of the Einstein-Strauss-de Sitter vakuola model. It is shown that\nrefraction of light at the matching surface of the vakuola and the expanding\nFriedman universe can be very important during accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse, when the velocity of the matching surface relative to static\nSchwarzchildian observers becomes relativistic. Relevance of the refraction\neffect for the temperature fluctuations of CMBR is given in terms of the\nredshift and the angular extension of the fluctuating region.\n", "  The PS185 experiment at LEAR/CERN has investigated strangeness production in\nantiproton-proton collisions with final states such as $\\overline{\\Lambda}\n\\Lambda$, $\\overline{\\Sigma}^0 \\Lambda + c.c$, $\\overline{\\Sigma^+} \\Sigma^+$,\n$\\overline{\\Sigma^-} \\Sigma^-$ and $K_S K_S$. Results are presented from a\nstudy of about 32,000 {$K_S K_S X$} events obtained at several antiproton\nmomenta in the regions of 1.45 and 1.7 GeV/c. The $\\overline{p} p \\to K_S K_S\n\\eta$ cross sections extracted at these momenta constitute the first\nmeasurement of this reaction in flight and are broadly consistent with\nexpectations of a phase-space extrapolation of branching ratios from\nannihilation at rest.\n", "  Since the beginning of operations of the CERN Antiproton Decelerator in July\n2000, the successful deceleration, storage and manipulation of antiprotons has\nled to remarkable progress in the production of antimatter. The ATHENA\nCollaboration were the first to create and detect cold antihydrogen in 2002,\nand we can today produce large enough amounts of antiatoms to study their\nproperties as well as the parameters that govern their production rate.\n", "  Atomic systems of antiparticles are the laboratories of choice for tests of\nCPT symmetry with antimatter. The ATHENA experiment was the first to report the\nproduction of copious amounts of cold antihydrogen in 2002. This article\nreviews some of the insights that have since been gained concerning the\nantihydrogen production process as well as the external and internal properties\nof the produced anti-atoms. Furthermore, the implications of those results on\nfuture prospects of symmetry tests with antimatter are discussed.\n", "  In the previous paper, we construct the angular distribution functions for\nmuon and electron as well as their relative fluctuation functions to find\nsuitable discrimination procedure between muon and electron in Superkamiokande\nexperiment. In the present paper, we are able to discriminate muons from\nelectrons in Fully Contained Events with a probability of error of less than\nseveral %. At the same time, our geometrical reconstruction procedure,\nconsidering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image, gives an\nunsatisfactory resolution for 1GeV electron and muon, with a mean vertex\nposition error, delta r, of 5-10 m and a mean directional error, delta theta,\nof about 6-20 degrees. In contrast, a geometrical reconstruction procedure\nutilizing the full image and using a detailed approximation of the event\nangular distribution works much better: for a 1 GeV electron, delta r is about\n2 m and delta theta is about 3 degrees; for a 1GeV muon, delta r is about 3 m\nand delta theta is about 5 degrees. At 5 GeV, the corresponding values are\nabout 1.4 m and about 2 degree for electron and are about 2.9m and about 4.3\ndegrees for muon. The numerical values depend on a single PMT contribution\nthreshold. The values quoted above are the minima with respect to this\nthreshold.\n  Even the methodologically correct approach we have adopted, based on detailed\nsimulations using closer approximations than those adopted in the SK analysis,\ncannot reproduce the accuracies for particle discrimination, momentum\nresolution, interaction vertex location, and angular resolution obtained by the\nSK simulations, suggesting the assumptions in these may be inadequate.\n", "  We report on a search for pair production of first-generation scalar\nleptoquarks ($LQ$) in $p \\bar{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$=1.96 TeV using an\nintegrated luminosity of 203 $pb^{-1}$ collected at the Fermilab Tevatron\ncollider by the CDF experiment. We observe no evidence for $LQ$ production in\nthe topologies arising from $LQ \\bar{LQ} \\to eqeq$ and $LQ \\bar{LQ} \\to eq \\nu\nq$, and derive 95% C.L. upper limits on the $LQ$ production cross section. %as\na function of $\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the branching fraction for $LQ \\to eq$.\nThe results are combined with those obtained from a separately reported CDF\nsearch in the topology arising from $LQ\\bar{LQ} \\to \\nu q \\nu q$ and 95% C.L.\nlower limits on the LQ mass as a function of $\\beta = BR(LQ \\to eq) $ are\nderived. The limits are 236, 205 and 145 GeV/c$^2$ for $\\beta$ = 1, $\\beta$ =\n0.5 and $\\beta$ = 0.1, respectively.\n", "  We propose an approach for calculating $K\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays to the\nnext-to-leading order in chiral expansion. A detailed numerical study of this\napproach is being performed.\n", "  Responses to chemical potential of the pseudoscalar meson screening mass and\nthe chiral condensate in lattice QCD are investigated. On a $16 \\times 8^2\n\\times \\4$ lattice with two flavors of staggered quarks the first and second\nresponses below and above $T_c$ are evaluated. Different behavior in the low\nand the high temperature phases are observed, which may be explained as a\nconsequence of the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration.\n", "  We present a polynomial hybrid Monte Carlo (PHMC) algorithm for lattice QCD\nwith odd numbers of flavors of O(a)-improved Wilson quark action. The algorithm\nmakes use of the non-Hermitian Chebyshev polynomial to approximate the inverse\nsquare root of the fermion matrix required for an odd number of flavors. The\nsystematic error from the polynomial approximation is removed by a noisy\nMetropolis test for which a new method is developed. Investigating the property\nof our PHMC algorithm in the N_f=2 QCD case, we find that it is as efficient as\nthe conventional HMC algorithm for a moderately large lattice size (16^3 times\n48) with intermediate quark masses (m_{PS}/m_V ~ 0.7-0.8). We test our\nodd-flavor algorithm through extensive simulations of two-flavor QCD treated as\nan N_f = 1+1 system, and comparing the results with those of the established\nalgorithms for N_f=2 QCD. These tests establish that our PHMC algorithm works\non a moderately large lattice size with intermediate quark masses (16^3 times\n48, m_{PS}/m_V ~ 0.7-0.8). Finally we experiment with the (2+1)-flavor QCD\nsimulation on small lattices (4^3 times 8 and 8^3 times 16), and confirm the\nagreement of our results with those obtained with the R algorithm and\nextrapolated to a zero molecular dynamics step size.\n", "  The properties of the quark propagator in Landau gauge in quenched QCD are\nexamined for the overlap quark action. The overlap quark action satisfies the\nGinsparg-Wilson relation and as such provides an exact lattice realization of\nchiral symmetry. This in turn implies that the quark action is free of ${\\cal\nO}(a)$ errors. We present results using the standard Wilson fermion kernel in\nthe overlap formalism on a $12^3\\times 24$ lattice at a spacing of 0.125 fm. We\nobtain the nonperturbative momentum-dependent wavefunction renormalization\nfunction $Z(p)$ and the nonperturbative mass function $M(p)$ for a variety of\nbare masses. We perform a simple extrapolation to the chiral limit for these\nfunctions. We clearly observe the dynamically generated infrared mass and\nconfirm the qualitative behavior found for the Landau gauge quark propagator in\nearlier studies. We attempt to extract the quark condensate from the asymptotic\nbehavior of the mass function in the chiral limit.\n", "  The calculation of the I=2 pion scattering length in quenched lattice QCD is\nrevisited. The calculation is carried out with the Wilson fermion action\nemploying L\\\"uscher's finite size scaling method at $\\beta=5.9$, 6.1, and 6.3\ncorresponding to the range of lattice spacing $a\\simeq 0.12 - 0.07$ fm. We\nobtain in the continuum limit $a_0m_\\pi = -0.0410(69)$, which is consistent\nwith the prediction of chiral perturbation theory $a_0m_\\pi=-0.0444(10)$.\n", "  We propose an exact simulation algorithm for lattice QCD with dynamical\nKogut-Susskind fermion in which the N_f-flavor fermion operator is defined as\nthe N_f/4-th root of the Kogut-Susskind (KS) fermion operator. The algorithm is\nan extension of the Polynomial Hybrid Monte Carlo (PHMC) algorithm to KS\nfermions. The fractional power of the KS fermion operator is approximated with\na Hermitian Chebyshev polynomial, with which we can construct an algorithm for\nany number of flavors. The error which arises from the approximation is\ncorrected by the Kennedy-Kuti noisy Metropolis test. Numerical simulations are\nperformed for the two-flavor case for several lattice parameters in order to\nconfirm the validity and the practical feasibility of the algorithm. In\nparticular tests on a 16^4 lattice with a quark mass corresponding to\nm_{PS}/m_V ~ 0.68 are successfully accomplished. We conclude that our algorithm\nprovides an attractive exact method for dynamical QCD simulations with KS\nfermions.\n", "  We present a polynomial Hybrid Monte Carlo (PHMC) algorithm as an exact\nsimulation algorithm with dynamical Kogut-Susskind fermions. The algorithm uses\na Hermitian polynomial approximation for the fractional power of the KS fermion\nmatrix. The systematic error from the polynomial approximation is removed by\nthe Kennedy-Kuti noisy Metropolis test so that the algorithm becomes exact at a\nfinite molecular dynamics step size. We performed numerical tests with\n$N_f$$=$2 case on several lattice sizes. We found that the PHMC algorithm works\non a moderately large lattice of $16^4$ at $\\beta$$=$5.7, $m$$=$0.02\n($m_{\\mathrm{PS}}/m_{\\mathrm{V}}$$\\sim$0.69) with a reasonable computational\ntime.\n", "  We present a lattice QCD calculation of the scattering phase shift for the\nI=2 $S$-wave two-pion system using the finite size method proposed by\nL\\\"uscher. We work in the quenched approximation employing the standard\nplaquette action at $\\beta=5.9$ for gluons and the Wilson fermion action for\nquarks. The phase shift is extracted from the energy eigenvalues of the\ntwo-pion system, which are obtained by a diagonalization of the pion 4-point\nfunction evaluated for a set of relative spatial momenta. In order to change\nmomentum of the two-pion system, calculations are carried out on $24^3\\times\n60$, $32^3\\times 60$, and $48^3\\times 60$ lattices. The phase shift is\nsuccessfully calculated over the momentum range $0 < p^2 < 0.3 {\\rm GeV}^2$.\n", "  The quenched chiral logs are examined on a $16^3 \\times 28$ lattice with\nIwasaki gauge action and overlap fermions. The pion decay constant $f_{\\pi}$ is\nused to set the lattice spacing, $a = 0.200(3) {\\rm fm}$. With pion mass as low\nas $\\sim 180 {\\rm MeV}$, we see the quenched chiral logs clearly in\n$m_{\\pi}^2/m$ and $f_P$, the pseudoscalar decay constant. We analyze the data\nto determine how low the pion mass needs to be in order for the quenched\none-loop chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT) to apply. With the constrained\ncurve-fitting method, we are able to extract the quenched chiral log parameter\n$\\delta$ together with other low-energy parameters. Only for $m_{\\pi} \\leq 300\n{\\rm MeV}$ do we obtain a consistent and stable fit with a constant $\\delta$\nwhich we determine to be 0.24(3)(4) (at the chiral scale $\\Lambda_{\\chi}=0.8\n{\\rm GeV}$). By comparing to the $12^3 \\times 28$ lattice, we estimate the\nfinite volume effect to be about 2.7% for the smallest pion mass. We also\nfitted the pion mass to the form for the re-summed cactus diagrams and found\nthat its applicable region is extended farther than the range for the one-loop\nformula, perhaps up to $m_{\\pi} \\sim 500-600$ MeV. The scale independent\n$\\delta$ is determined to be 0.20(3) in this case. We study the quenched\nnon-analytic terms in the nucleon mass and find that the coefficient $C_{1/2}$\nin the nucleon mass is consistent with the prediction of one-loop $\\chi$PT\\@.\nWe also obtain the low energy constant $L_5$ from $f_{\\pi}$. We conclude from\nthis study that it is imperative to cover only the range of data with the pion\nmass less than $\\sim 300 {\\rm MeV}$ in order to examine the chiral behavior of\nthe hadron masses and decay constants in quenched QCD and match them with\nquenched one-loop $\\chi$PT\\@.\n", "  We present a lattice QCD calculation of the heavy quark expansion parameters\n$\\mu_{\\pi}^2$ and $\\mu_G^2$ for heavy-light mesons and heavy-light-light\nbaryons. The calculation is carried out on a 20$^3\\times$48 lattice at $\\beta$\n= 6.0 in the quenched approximation, using the lattice NRQCD action for heavy\nquarks. We obtain the parameters $\\mu_{\\pi}^2$ and $\\mu_G^2$ in two different\nmethods: a direct calculation of the matrix elements and an indirect\ncalculation through the mass spectrum, and confirm that the both methods give\nconsistent results. We also discuss an application to the lifetime ratios.\n", "  This is the first part of a study of the quark propagator and the vertex\nfunction of the vector current on the lattice in the Landau gauge and using\nboth Wilson-clover and overlap actions. In order to be able to identify lattice\nartifacts and to reach large momenta we use a range of lattice spacings. The\nlattice artifacts turn out to be exceedingly large in this study. We present a\nnew and very efficient method to eliminate the hypercubic (anisotropy)\nartifacts based on a systematic expansion on hypercubic invariants which are\nnot SO(4) invariant. A simpler version of this method has been used in previous\nworks. This method is shown to be significantly more efficient than the popular\n``democratic'' methods. It can of course be applied to the lattice simulations\nof many other physical quantities. The analysis indicates a hierarchy in the\nsize of hypercubic artifacts: overlap larger than clover and propagator larger\nthan vertex function. This pleads for the combined study of propagators and\nvertex functions via Ward identities.\n", "  We present a quenched lattice QCD calculation of the \\alpha and \\beta\nparameters of the proton decay matrix element. The simulation is carried out\nusing the Wilson quark action at three values of the lattice spacing in the\nrange a\\approx 0.1-0.064 fm to study the scaling violation effect. We find only\nmild scaling violation when the lattice scale is determined by the nucleon\nmass. We obtain in the continuum limit,\n|\\alpha(NDR,2GeV)|=0.0090(09)(^{+5}_{-19})GeV^3 and\n|\\beta(NDR,2GeV)|=0.0096(09)(^{+6}_{-20})GeV^3 with \\alpha and \\beta in a\nrelatively opposite sign, where the first error is statistical and the second\nis due to the uncertainty in the determination of the physical scale.\n", "  We discuss the contribution of OZI-suppressed diagrams to the hyperfine\nsplitting of charmonium in lattice QCD. We study valence quark mass regions\nfrom strange to charm quark masses. No contribution of the disconnected diagram\nis seen in the vector meson channel. In the pseudo-scalar channel and for\nvalence quark masses around the strange quark, the disconnected contribution\ninduces a considerable increase of the meson mass. This contribution quickly\ndecreases as the quark mass increases. For charmonium the effect is very small\nalthough a decrease of the pseudoscalar mass induced by the disconnected\ncontribution cannot be ruled out.\n", "  We have simulated $(3+1)-$dimensional finite temperature $Z_2$ gauge theory\nby using Metropolis algorithm. We aimed to observe the deconfinement phase\ntransitions by using geometric methods. In order to do so we have proposed two\ndifferent methods which can be applied to $3-$dimensional effective spin model\nconsisting of Polyakov loop variables. The first method is based on studies of\ncluster structures of each configuration. For each temperature, configurations\nare obtained from a set of bond probability ($P$) values. At a certain\nprobability, percolating clusters start to emerge. Unless the probability value\ncoincides with the Coniglio-Klein probability value, the fluctuations are less\nthan the actual fluctuations at the critical point. In this method the task is\nto identify the probability value which yields the highest peak in the\ndiverging quantities on finite lattices. The second method uses the scaling\nfunction based on the surface renormalization which is of geometric origin.\nSince this function is a scaling function, the measurements done on\ndifferent-size lattices yield the same value at the critical point, apart from\nthe correction to scaling terms. The linearization of the scaling function\naround the critical point yields the critical point and the critical exponents.\n", "  We study the scaling behavior of the step scaling function for SU(3) gauge\ntheory, employing the renormalization-group improved Iwasaki gauge action and\nthe perturbatively improved L\\\"uscher-Weisz gauge action. We confirm that the\nstep scaling functions from the improved gauge actions agree with that\npreviously obtained from the plaquette action within errors in the continuum\nlimit at both weak and strong coupling regions. We also investigate how\ndifferent choices of boundary counter terms for the improved gauge actions\naffect the scaling behavior. In the extrapolation to the continuum limit, we\nobserve that the cut off dependence becomes moderate for the Iwasaki action, if\na perturbative reduction of scaling violations is applied to the simulation\nresults. We also measure the low energy scale ratio with the Iwasaki action,\nand confirm its universality.\n", "  The calculation of quark propagators for Ginsparg-Wilson-type Dirac operators\nis costly and thus limited to a few different sources. We present a new\napproach for determining spatially optimized operators for lattice spectroscopy\nof excited hadrons. Jacobi smeared quark sources with different widths are\ncombined to construct hadron operators with different spatial wave functions.\nWe study the Roper state and excited rho and pion mesons.\n", "  We test the finite density algorithm in the canonical ensemble which combines\nthe HMC update with the accept/reject step according to the ratio of the\nfermion number projected determinant to the unprojected one as a way of\navoiding the determinant fluctuation problem. We report our preliminary results\non the Polyakov loop in different baryon number sectors which exhibit\ndeconfinement transitions on small lattices. The largest density we obtain\naround $T_c$ is an order of magnitude larger than that of nuclear matter. From\nthe conserved vector current, we calculate the quark number and verify that the\nmixing of different baryon sectors is small.\n", "  We carry out a finite density calculation based on a canonical approach which\nis designed to address the overlap problem. Two degenerate flavor simulations\nare performed using Wilson gauge action and Wilson fermions on $4^4$ lattices,\nat temperatures close to the critical temperature $T_c\\approx 170\\MeV$ and\nlarge densities (5 to 20 times nuclear matter density). In this region, we find\nthat the algorithm works well. We compare our results with those from other\napproaches.\n", "  We compute non-perturbatively the renormalization constants of composite\noperators on a quenched $16^3 \\times 28 $ lattice with lattice spacing $a$ =\n0.20 fm for the overlap fermion by using the regularization independent (RI)\nscheme. The quenched gauge configurations were generated with the Iwasaki\naction. We test the relations $Z_A = Z_V$ and $ Z_S=Z_P$ and find that they\nagree well {(less than 1%)} above $\\mu$ = 1.6 GeV. %even for our lattice with a\ncoarse lattice spacing. We also perform a Renormalization Group (RG) analysis\nat the next-to-next-to-leading order and match the renormalization constants to\nthe $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ scheme. The wave-function renormalization $Z_{\\psi}$ is\ndetermined from the vertex function of the axial current and $Z_A$ from the\nchiral Ward identity. Finally, we examine the finite quark mass behavior for\nthe renormalization factors of the quark bilinear operators. We find that the\n$(pa)^2$ errors of the vertex functions are small and the quark mass dependence\nof the renormalization factors to be quite weak.\n", "  We investigate the behaviour of heavy $QQ$- and $QQQ$-free energies in SU(3)\npure gauge theory at finite temperature. After stating some general properties\nof the free energies, we discuss the $QQ$-antitriplet and -sextet channels as\nwell as free energies in different $QQQ$-channels. We perform a detailed finite\nvolume scaling analysis of $QQ$-free energies below and above $T_c$. Moreover,\nwe also discuss the relation of the $QQ$-antitriplet to the $Q\\bar Q$-singlet\nfree energies. A comparison of the effective running coupling indicates that\nthe $r$-dependence of the free energies differs by a factor of two in agreement\nwith the different Casimir factors. We observe that the baryonic free energies\ncan be decomposed into a sum of two particle interactions.\n", "  We present a summary of results of the joint CP-PACS and JLQCD project toward\na 2+1 flavor full QCD simulation with the O(a)-improved Wilson quark formalism\nand the Iwasaki gauge action. Configurations were generated during 2002-2005 at\nthree lattice spacings, a~0.076, 0.100 and 0.122 fm, keeping the physical\nvolume constant at (2.0fm)^3. Up and down quark masses are taken in the range\nm_{PS}/m_V~0.6-0.78. We have completed the analysis for the light meson\nspectrum and quark masses in the continuum limit using the full configuration\nset. The predicted meson masses reproduce experimental values in the continuum\nlimit at a 1% level. The average up and down, and strange quark masses turn out\nto be m_{ud}^{\\bar{MS}}(\\mu=2 GeV)=3.50(14)({}^{+26}_{-15}) MeV and\nm_s^{\\bar{MS}}(\\mu=2 GeV)=91.8(3.9)({}^{+6.8}_{-4.1}) MeV. We discuss our\nfuture strategy toward definitive results on hadron spectroscopy with the\nWilson-clover formalism.\n", "  We construct from first principles a perturbative framework for studying\nnonequilibrium quantum-field systems that include gauge bosons. The system of\nour concern is quasiuniform system near equilibrium or nonequilibrium\nquasistationary system. We employ the closed-time-path formalism and use the\nso-called gradient approximation. No further approximation is introduced. We\nconstruct a gauge-boson propagator, with which a well-defined perturbative\nframework is formulated. In the course of construction of the framework, we\nobtain the generalized Boltzmann equation (GBE) that describes the evolution of\nthe number-density functions of gauge-bosonic quasiparticles. The framework\nallows us to compute the reaction rate for any process taking place in the\nsystem. Various processes, in turn, cause an evolution of the systems, which is\ndescribed by the GBE.\n", "  We compare recent theoretical determinations of weak matrix elements of the\nelectroweak penguin operators Q7 and Q8. We pay special attention to the\nrenormalization scheme dependence of these determinations as well as to the\ninfluence of higher dimension operators in the different approaches.\n", "  In the context of SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x [U(1)]^n, SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L x SU(2)_R x\n[U(1)]^n' and SU(3)_c x SU(3)_L x[U(1)]^n'', we analyze the possible values for\nn, n' and n''. That is, we look for the number of family-independent,\nindependent abelian hypercharges that can be gauged in each one of those\nmodels. We find that n=n'=1 for the minimal fermion content, but n can take any\nvalue if we add the right-handed neutrino field to each family in the Standard\nModel.\n", "  The heavy quark potential and particularly the one proposed by Richardson to\nincorporate both asymptotic freedom and linear confinement is analyzed in terms\nof a generalized Borel Transform recently proposed. We were able to obtain, in\nthe range of physical interest, an approximate analytical expression for the\npotential in coordinate space valid even for intermediate distances. The\ndeviation between our approximate potential and the numerical evaluation of the\nRichardson's one is much smaller than $\\Lambda $ of QCD. The $c\\overline{c}$\nand $b\\overline{b}$ quarkonia energy levels agree reasonably well with\nexperimental data for $c$ and $b$ masses in good agreement with the values\nobtained from experiments.\n", "  We compute a compact OPE formula describing power corrections to the\nperturbative expression for the asymmetric $\\widetilde{MOM}$-renormalized\nrunning coupling constant up to the leading logarithm. By the use of the\nphenomelogical hypothesis leading to the factorization of the condensates\nthrough a perturbative vacuum insertion, the only relevant condensate in the\ngame is $<A^2>$. The validity of the OPE formula is tested by searching for a\ngood-quality coherent description of previous lattice evaluations of\n$\\widetilde{MOM}$-renormalized gluon propagator and running coupling.\n", "  We present the first attempt of a new method to compute the pion light-cone\nwave function (LCWF) on the lattice. We compute the matrix element between the\npion and the vacuum of a non-local operator: the propagator of a ``scalar\nquark'' (named for short \"squark\"). A theoretical analysis shows that for some\nkinematical conditions (energetic pion and hard squark) this matrix element\ndepends dominantly on the LCWF $\\Phi_\\pi(u), u\\in [0,1]$. On the lattice, the\ndiscretization of the parton momenta imposes further constraints on the pion\nmomentum. The two-point Green functions made of squark-quark and squark-squark\nfields show hadron-like bound-state behaviour and verify the standard energy\nspectrum. We show some indications that during a short time, after being\ncreated, the system of the spectator quark and the squark behave like partons,\nbefore they form a hadron-like bound state. This short time is the place where\nthe partonic wave function has to be looked for.\n", "  Applying Jarlskog's treatment of the CKM matrix, to the neutralino mass\nmatrix in MSSM for real soft gaugino SUSY breaking and $\\mu$-parameters, we\nconstruct explicit analytical expressions for the four projectors which acting\non any neutralino state project out the mass eigenstates. Analytical\nexpressions for the neutralino mass eigenvalues in terms of the various SUSY\nparameters, are also given. It is shown that these projectors and mass\neigenvalues are sufficient to describe any physical observable involving\nneutralinos, to any order of perturbation theory. As an example, the $e^-e^+\n\\to \\tilde \\chi^0_i \\tilde \\chi^0_j $ cross section at tree level is given in\nterms of these projectors. The expected magnitude of their various matrix\nelements in plausible SUSY scenarios is also discussed.\n", "  We present preliminary results on the computation of the QCD running coupling\nconstant in the $\\widetilde{MOM}$ scheme and Landau gauge with two flavours of\ndynamical Wilson quarks. Gluon momenta range up to about 7 GeV ($\\beta =$ 5.6,\n5.8 and 6.0) with a constant dynamical-quark mass. This range already allows to\nexhibit some evidence for a sizable $1/\\mu^2$ correction to the asymptotic\nbehaviour, as in the quenched approximation, although a fit without power\ncorrections is still possible with a reasonable $\\chi^2$. Following the\nconclusions of our quenched study, we take into account $1/\\mu^2$ correction to\nthe asymptotic behaviour. We find $\\Lambda_{\\rm \\bar{MS}}^{N_f=2} = 264(27)\n{\\rm MeV} \\times [{a^{-1}(5.6,0.1560)}/{2.19 {\\rm GeV}}] $, which leads to\n$\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.113(3)(4)$. The latter result has to be taken as a\npreliminary indication rather than a real prediction in view of the systematic\nerrors still to be controlled. Still, being two sigmas below the experimental\nresult makes it very encouraging.\n", "  It is shown in a systematic way that the instanton dilute model can be\ncombined with the global colour symmetry model to form a new nonperturbative\nQCD model. Based on the quark propagator derived in the instanton dilute liquid\napproximation, the quark condensate $<\\bar{q}q>$, the mixed quark gluon\ncondensate $g_{s}<\\bar{q}G_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}q>$, the four quark\ncondensate $<|bar{q}\\Gamma q\\bar{q}\\Gamma q>$ and tensor, pion vacuum\nsusceptibilities have been calculated at the mean field level in the framework\nof the new nonperturbative QCD model. The numerical results are compatible with\nthe values obtained within other nonperturbative approaches. The calculated\nmasses and decay constants of $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ mesons are also close to the\nexperimental values.\n", "  We show that QCD Green functions in Landau Gauge exhibit sizable $O(1/\\mu^2)$\ncorrections to the expected perturbative behavior at energies as high as 10\nGeV. We argue that these are due to a $<A^2>$-condensate which does not vanish\nin Landau gauge.\n", "  Taking into account mixings among neutrino states, the end of the energy\nspectrum of the electron in the tritium beta decay is investigated. It is shown\nthat for real energy resolutions of a spectrometer, $ \\Delta E > 0.08$ eV, the\neffective electron neutrino mass should [not] be taken in the form\n$m_\\beta^{(1)} = \\sqrt{\\sum|U_{ei}|^2 m_i^2} [m_\\beta^{(2)} = \\sum|U_{ei}|^2\nm_i$.\n", "  We show that the ''turbulent'' particle spectra found in numerical\nsimulations of the behavior of matter fields during reheating admit a simple\ninterpretation in terms of hydrodynamic models of the reheating period. We\npredict a particle number spectrum $n_{k}\\propto k^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\sim\n2$ for $k\\to 0.$\n", "  % insert abstract here We study the production of the Higgs bosons predicted\nin the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model $(h^0, H^0, A^0,\nH^\\pm)$, with the reactions $e^{+}e^{-}\\to b\\bar b h^0 (H^0, A^0)$, and\n$e^+e^-\\to \\tau^-\\bar \\nu_\\tau H^+, \\tau^+\\nu_\\tau H^-$, using the helicity\nformalism. We evaluate cross section of $h^0, H^0, A^0$ and $H^\\pm$ in the\nlimit when $\\tan\\beta$ is large. The numerical computation is done considering\ntwo stages of a possible Next Linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ Collider: the first with\n$\\sqrt{s}=500$ $GeV$ and design luminosity 50 $fb^{-1}$, and the second with\n$\\sqrt{s}=1$ $TeV$ and luminosity 100-200 $fb^{-1}$.\n", "  We start from a Left-Right Symmetric Model with massive Dirac neutrinos, with\nan electromagnetic structure that consists of a charge radius, and we calculate\nthe cross-section of the scattering $\\nu_{\\mu}e^-\\to \\nu_{\\mu}e^-$.\nSubsequently, we calculate the simultaneous contribution of the charge radius,\nof the additional $Z_{2}$ heavy gauge boson and of the mixing angle $\\phi$\nparameter of the model at the constants of couplings $(g^{\\nu e}_{V})_{LRSM}$\nand $(g^{\\nu e}_{A})_{LRSM}$.\n", "  We start from a Left-Right Symmetric Model and we analyze the beta decay of\nthe free neutron $n\\to p+e^{-}+\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$. We applied this model to\nincorporate the right currents, whereby we propose an amplitude whose leptonic\npart contains the parameter $\\lambda $ defined as left-right asymmetry\nparameter which measures the parity violation. The analysis consists of seeing\nhow the spectrum of energy of the electrons, the total rate of decay, and the\nlifetime $\\tau $ of the neutron are affected by the left-right asymmetry\nparameter, besides taking into account corrections of mass, that is, $m_{e}\\neq\n0$, $m_{p}\\neq m_{n}$, and the recoil of the proton.\n", "  The three-nucleon bound state problem is studied employing a nucleon-nucleon\npotential obtained from a basic quark-quark interaction in a five-channel\nFaddeev calculation. The obtained triton binding energy is comparable to those\npredicted by conventional models of the $NN$ force.\n", "  We present a new formalism describing the neutralino physics in the context\nof the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM), where CP violation induced by\ncomplex $M_1$ and $\\mu$ parameters is allowed. The formalism is based on the\nconstruction of neutralino projectors, and can be directly generalized to\nnon-minimal SUSY models involving any number of neutralinos. It extends a\nprevious work applied to the real SUSY parameter case. In MSSM, the method\nallows to describe all physical observables related to a specific neutralino,\nin terms of its\n  CP eigenphase and three complex numbers called its \"reduced projector\nelements\".\n  As the experimental knowledge on the neutralino-chargino sectors will be\nbeing accumulated, the problem of extracting the various SUSY parameters will\narise. Motivated by this, we consider various scenarios concerning the\nquantities that could be first measured. Analytical disentangled expressions\ndetermining the related SUSY parameters from them, are then derived, which also\nemphasize the efficiency of the formalism.\n", "  The running coupling constant can be estimated by computing gluon two- and\nthree-point Green functions from the lattice. Computing in lattice implies\nworking in a fixed gauge sector (Landau). An source of systematic uncertainty\nis then the contribution of non gauge-invariant condensates, as $<A^2 >$,\ngenerating power corrections that might still be important at very high\nenergies. We study the impact of this gluon condensate on the analysis of gluon\npropagator and vertex lattice data and on the estimate of $\\Lambda_{\\bar{\\rm\nMS}}$. We finally try a qualitative description of this gluon condensate\nthrough the instanton picture\n", "  We present the results of the first lattice QCD study of the strong coupling\ng_{D^* D pi}. From our simulations in the quenched approximation, we obtain\ng_{D^* D pi} = 18.8 +/- 2.3^{+1.1}_{-2.0} and hat(g)_c = 0.67 +/-\n0.08^{+0.04}_{-0.06}. Whereas previous theoretical studies gave different\npredictions, our result favours a large value for hat(g)_c. It agrees very well\nwith the recent experimental value by CLEO. hat(g) varies very little with the\nheavy mass and we find in the infinite mass limit hat(g)_infinity = 0.69(18).\n", "  We investigate an influence of virtual particles on the classical motion of a\nsystem in Minkowski and Euclidean spaces. Our results indicate that\nfluctuations of fields different from the main field decelerate significantly\nits motion at high energies. The formalism described here is applicable to the\nmajority of inflationary models. We show also that the quantum fluctuations\nsuppress false vacuum decay in first-order phase transitions at high energies.\n", "  We give a more transparent understanding of the vacuum expectation value of\nthe renormalised local operator A^2 by relating it to the gluon propagator\nintegrated over the momentum. The quadratically divergent perturbative\ncontribution is subtracted and the remainder, dominantly due to the O(1/p^2)\ncorrection to the perturbative propagator at large p^2 is logarithmically\ndivergent. This provides a transparent derivation of the fact that this\nO(1/p^2) term is related to the vacuum expectation value of the local A^2\noperator and confirms a previous claim based on the operator product expansion\n(OPE) of the gluon propagator. At leading logarithms the agreement is\nquantitative, with a standard running factor, between the local A^2 condensate\nrenormalised as described above and the one renormalised in the OPE context.\n", "  Gluon two- and three-point Green Functions computed in Landau gauge from the\nlattice show the existence of power corrections to the purely perturbative\nexpressions, that can be explained through an Operator Product Expansion as the\ninfluence of a non gauge invariant mass dimension two condensate. The\nrelationship of this condensate with topological properties of QCD, namely\ninstantons, will be studied, giving a first estimate of the contribution of\ninstantons to this condensate based in the direct lattice measure, after a\ncooling process, of the instanton liquid properties.\n", "  We construct an $SU(3)_L \\times U(1)_N$ gauge model based on an $S_{2L}$\npermutation symmetry for left-handed $\\mu$ and $\\tau$ families, which provides\nthe almost maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and the large solar neutrino\nmixing of the LMA type. Neutrinos acquire one-loop radiative masses induced by\nthe radiative mechanism of the Zee type as well as tree level masses induced by\nthe type II seesaw mechanism utilizing interactions of lepton triplets with an\nSU(3)-sextet scalar. The atmospheric neutrino mixing controlled by the\ntree-level and radiative masses turns out to be almost maximal owing to the\npresence of $S_{2L}$ supplemented by a $Z_4$ discrete symmetry. These\nsymmetries ensure the almost equality between the $\\nu_e$-$\\nu_\\mu$ and\n$\\nu_e$-$\\nu_\\tau$ radiative masses dominated by contributions from heavy\nleptons contained in the third members of lepton triplets, whose Yukawa\ninteractions conserve $S_{2L}$, even after the spontaneous breaking. The solar\nneutrino mixing controlled by radiative masses including a $\\nu_\\mu$-$\\nu_\\tau$\nmass, which are taken to be the similar order, turns out to be described by\nlarge solar neutrino mixing angles.\n", "  Lattice data seems to show that power corrections should be convoked to\ndescribe appropriately the transition of the QCD coupling constant running from\nU.V. to I.R. domains. Those power corrections for the Landau-gauge MOM coupling\nconstant in a pure Yang-Mills theory (N_f=0) are analysed in terms of Operator\nProduct Expansion (O.P.E.) of two- and three-point Green functions, the gluon\ncondensate <A^2> emerging from this study. The semi-classical picture given by\ninstantons can be also used to look for into the nature of the power\ncorrections and gluon condensate.\n", "  An extended study is performed of geometrical and kinematical assumptions\nused in calculations of the neutrino oscillation phase. The almost universally\nemployed `equal velocity' assumption, in which all neutrino mass eigenstates\nare produced at the same time, is shown to underestimate, by a factor of two,\nthe neutrino propagation contribution to the phase. Taking properly into\naccount, in a covariant path amplitude calculation, the incoherent nature of\nneutrino production as predicted by the Standard Model, results in an important\nsource propagator contribution to the phase. It is argued that the commonly\ndiscussed Gaussian `wave packets' have no basis within quantum mechanics and\nare the result of a confused amalgam of quantum and classical wave concepts.\n", "  We present a study of $\\alpha_{MOM}(p)$ at small p computed from the lattice.\nIt shows a dramatic $\\propto p^4$ law which can be understood within an\ninstanton liquid model. In this framework the prefactor gives a direct measure\nof the instanton density in thermalised configurations. A preliminary result\nfor this density is 5.27(4) fm^{-4}.\n", "  A behavior of imaginary and real parts of the high-energy elastic hadron\nscattering amplitude is examined in the diffraction region. It is shown that\nthe interference between Coulomb and hadronic scattering at small momentum\ntransfers and especially in the region of diffractive minimum can bring some\ninformation about the structure of the hadron spin-non-flip amplitude.\n", "  The fluxes of atmospheric muons and neutrinos are calculated by a three\ndimensional Monte Carlo simulation with the air shower code CORSIKA using the\nhadronic interaction models DPMJET, VENUS, GHEISHA, and UrQMD. For the\nsimulation of low energy primary particles the original CORSIKA has been\nextended by a parametrization of the solar modulation and a microscopic\ncalculation of the directional dependence of the geomagnetic cut-off functions.\nAn accurate description for the geography of the Earth has been included by a\ndigital elevation model, tables for the local magnetic field in the atmosphere,\nand various atmospheric models for different geographic latitudes and annual\nseasons. CORSIKA is used to calculate atmospheric muon fluxes for different\nlocations and the neutrino fluxes for Kamioka. The results of CORSIKA for the\nmuon fluxes are verified by an extensive comparison with recent measurements.\nThe obtained neutrino fluxes are compared with other calculations and the\ninfluence of the hadronic interaction model, the geomagnetic cut-off and the\nlocal magnetic field on the neutrino fluxes is investigated.\n", "  Within the framework of the Top-color-assisted Technicolor (TC2) model, we\ncalculate the new physics contributions to the branching ratios $\\calb(B_{s,d}\n\\to \\gamma \\gamma)$ and CP violating asymmetries $\\rcpm(B_{s,d} \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma)$ in the QCD factorization based on the heavy-quark limit $m_b \\gg\n\\Lambda_{QCD}$. Using the considered parameter space, we find that (a) for both\n$B_s\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ and $B_d \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ decays, the new physics\ncontribution can provide a factor of two to six enhancement to their branching\nratios, (b) for the $B_s \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ decay, its direct CP violation is\nvery small in both the SM and TC2 model, and (c) the CP violating asymmetry\n$\\rcpm(B_d \\to \\gamma \\gamma)$ is around the ten percent level in both the SM\nand TC2 model, but the sign of CP asymmetry in the TC2 model is different from\nthat in the SM.\n", "  We assume that a massive Dirac neutrino is characteized by two\nphenomenological parameters, a magnetic moment, and a charge radius, and we\ncalculate the cross-section of the scattering $e^+e^-\\to \\nu \\bar \\nu$ in a\nleft-right symmetric model. We also analyze the angular distribution of the\nneutrino (antineutrino) with respect to the original direction of the electron\n(positron) to different state of helicity of the neutrino. We find that the\nfavored directions for the neutrino (antineutrino) with respect to the electron\n(positron) is forward $(\\theta =0)$ and backward $(\\theta= \\pi)$, and is not\nvery probable in the perpendicular direction $(\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. The\ncalculation is for $\\phi = -0.005$ and $M_{Z_2}=500$ $GeV$, parameters of the\nLeft-Right symmetric model.\n", "  If neutrinos are massive, `lepton flavour eigenstates' are absent from the\namplitudes of all Standard Model processes. Measurements of $\\Gamma(\\pi \\to e\n\\nu)/\\Gamma(\\pi \\to \\mu \\nu)$ and of the MNS matrix are shown to exclude the\nexistence of such states. Incoherent production of neutrinos of different\nflavour modifies the usual oscillation phase derived assuming production of a\nlepton flavour eigenstate. The new prediction can be tested in long line-base\nexperiments by comparison of `$\\nu_{\\mu}$ disappearance' of neutrinos from pion\nand kaon decay.\n", "  We study the Higgs pair-production in the Standard Model of the strong and\nelectroweak interactions at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider energies, with the\nreaction $e^{+}e^{-}\\to t \\bar t HH$. We evaluated the total cross section of\n$t\\bar tHH$ and calculate the number total of events considering the complete\nset of Feynman diagrams at tree-level. The numerical computation is done for\nthe energy which is expected to be available at a possible Next Linear\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ Collider: with center-of-mass energy $800, 1600$ $GeV$ and\nluminosity 1000 $fb^{-1}$.\n", "  In this paper, we draw constraints on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)\nangle $\\alpha$ and the strong phase $\\delta$ from the experimental measurements\nof $\\ssb$, the CP-violating asymmetries and branching ratios of $B \\to \\pi^+\n\\pi^-, \\pi^+ \\pi^0$ and $K^0 \\pi^+$ decays. In the SM, the measured $\\ssb$\nleads to an upper limit on $\\alpha$: $\\alpha \\leq 180^\\circ-\\beta$. Taking the\nweighted-average of the newest BaBar and Belle measurements of $\\spp$ and\n$\\app$ in $B^0 \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay as the experimental input, we find the\nallowed range of angle $\\alpha$, $76^\\circ \\leq \\alpha \\leq 135^\\circ$ for\n$r=|P/T| =0.3 \\pm 0.1 $. From the measured CP-averaged branching ratios of $B\n\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-, \\pi^+ \\pi^0$ and $K^0 \\pi^+$ decays, we found an inequality,\n$\\cos{\\alpha} \\cos{\\delta} \\geq 0.45$. The region of $70^\\circ \\leq \\alpha \\leq\n110^\\circ$ is thus excluded by applying this inequality. The combined\nconstraints on $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$ are $117^\\circ \\leq \\alpha \\leq 135^\\circ$\nand $-160^\\circ \\leq \\delta \\leq -132^\\circ$ if we take $\\spp=0.49 \\pm 0.27$\nand $\\app=0.51 \\pm 0.19$ as the experimental input. The new lower limit on the\nangle $\\alpha$ is dominated by the measured branching ratios considered in this\npaper, and is much stronger than those obtained before.\n", "  Feynman's path amplitude formulation of quantum mechanics is used to analyse\nthe production of charged leptons from charged current weak interaction\nprocesses. For neutrino induced reactions the interference effects predicted\nare usually called `neutrino oscillations'. Similar effects in the detection of\nmuons from pion decay are here termed `muon oscillations'. Processes considered\ninclude pion decay (at rest and in flight), and muon decay and nuclear\n$\\beta$-decay at rest. In all cases studied, a neutrino oscillation phase\ndifferent from the conventionally used one is found. A concise critical review\nis made of previous treatments of the quantum mechanics of neutrino and muon\noscillations.\n", "  The phases of quantum interference effects in charged lepton production by\nneutrinos (neutrino oscillations) following pion decay at rest and in flight,\nmuon decay and nuclear $\\beta-$decay at rest as well as for `muon oscillations'\nfollowing pion decay at rest and in flight are calculated. The same phase is\nfound for neutrino and muon oscillations following pion decay at rest. The\nresults found disagree with the conventionally used value: $\\phi_{12} = \\Delta\nm^2 L/(2P)$. Differences to previous treatments are briefly commented on\n", "  We analyze the order-$\\alpha_s^2$ QCD corrections to semi-inclusive deep\ninelastic scattering and present results for processes initiated by a gluon. We\nfocus in the most singular pieces of these corrections in order to obtain the\nhitherto unknown NLO evolution kernels relevant for the non homogeneous QCD\nscale dependence of these cross sections, and to check explicitly factorization\nat this order. In so doing we discuss the prescription of overlapping\nsingularities in more than one variable.\n", "  We analyze neutrinoless double $\\beta$-decay ($\\nbb$-decay) mediated by heavy\nparticles from the standpoint of effective field theory. We show how symmetries\nof the $\\nbb$-decay quark operators arising in a given particle physics model\ndetermine the form of the corresponding effective, hadronic operators. We\nclassify the latter according to their symmetry transformation properties as\nwell as the order at which they appear in a derivative expansion. We apply this\nframework to several particle physics models, including R-parity violating\nsupersymmetry (RPV SUSY) and the left-right symmetric model (LRSM) with mixing\nand a right-handed Majorana neutrino. We show that, in general, the pion\nexchange contributions to $\\nbb$-decay dominate over the short-range\nfour-nucleon operators. This confirms previously published RPV SUSY results and\nallows us to derive new constraints on the masses in the LRSM. In particular,\nwe show how a non-zero mixing angle $\\zeta$ in the left-right symmetry model\nproduces a new potentially dominant contribution to $\\nbb$-decay that\nsubstantially modifies previous limits on the masses of the right-handed\nneutrino and boson stemming from constraints from $\\nbb$-decay and vacuum\nstability requirements.\n", "  The definition of `lepton flavour eigenstates' introduced in a recent paper\nhep-ph/0302045 is in disagreement with the Standard Model prediction for the\nstructure of the leptonic charged current and implies the absence of neutrino\noscillations following pion decay, in contradiction to experimental data\n", "  A semiclassical description of structure functions in DIS at small $x$ is\npresented. It gives an intuitive picture of the transition from the Double\nLeading Log approximation at large $Q^2$, to the powerlike dependence on $x$ in\nthe BFKL region at limited $Q^2$. Formal derivations from perturbative QCD,\ne.g. in the BFKL or the CCFM formalisms, are technically complicated, and\ntherefore such an intuitive picture may be valuable and possibly helpful in the\nwork towards a better understanding of DIS, and of the strong interaction in\ngeneral.\n", "  Using the constrained curve fitting method and overlap fermions with the\nlowest pion mass at $180 {\\rm MeV}$, we observe that the masses of the first\npositive and negative parity excited states of the nucleon tend to cross over\nas the quark masses are taken to the chiral limit. Both results at the physical\npion mass agree with the experimental values of the Roper resonance\n($N^{1/2+}(1440)$) and $S_{11}$ ($N^{1/2-}(1535)$). This is seen for the first\ntime in a lattice QCD calculation. These results are obtained on a quenched\nIwasaki $16^3 \\times 28$ lattice with $a = 0.2 {\\rm fm}$. We also extract the\nghost $\\eta' N$ states (a quenched artifact) which are shown to decouple from\nthe nucleon interpolation field above $m_{\\pi} \\sim 300 {\\rm MeV}$. From the\nquark mass dependence of these states in the chiral region, we conclude that\nspontaneously broken chiral symmetry dictates the dynamics of light quarks in\nthe nucleon.\n", "  A number of misleading or incorrect comments by C.Giunti on seven arXiv\npreprints that I have written on the theory of neutrino oscillations are\ndiscussed. The essential new features of my approach are also briefly reviewed\n", "  The general equation from previous work is specialized to a linear potential\n$V(r)=-a+F r$ acting in the space of spherically symmetric S wave functions.\nThe fine and hyperfine interaction creates then a $\\frac1r$-dependence in the\neffective potential energy equation and a position dependent mass $\\widetilde\nm(r)$ in the effective kinetic energy of the associated Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nThe results are compared with the available experimental and theoretical\nspectral data on the $\\pi$ and $\\rho$. Solving the eigenvalue problem within\nthe analytically tractable Airy-function approach induces a certain amount of\narbitrariness (fudge factors). Despite of this, the agreement with experimental\ndata is good and partially better than other calculations, including Godfrey\nand Isgur \\cite{GodIsg85} and Baldicchi and Prosperi \\cite{BalPro02}. The short\ncomings of the present model can be removed easily in more elaborate work.\n", "  We trace here instantons through the analysis of pure Yang-Mills gluon Green\nfunctions in the Landau gauge for a window of IR momenta (0.4 GeV $< k < 0.9$\nGeV). We present lattice results that can be fitted only after substituting the\nBPST profile in the Instanton liquid model (ILM) by one based on the Diakonov\nand Petrov variational methods. This also leads us to gain information on the\nparameters of ILM.\n", "  We study the rare decays $B^+ \\to D^{(*)+}K^{(*)0}$, which can occur only via\nannihilation type diagrams in the standard model. We calculate all of the four\nmodes, $B \\to PP, VP, PV, VV$, in the framework of perturbative QCD approach\nand give the branching ratios of the order about $10^{-6}$.\n", "  We calculate Higgs production cross sections at a muon collider in the Two\nHiggs Doublet Model of type II. The most interesting productions channels are\nmu^- mu^+ --> h^0 Z^0, H^0 Z^0, H^- H^+, A^0 Z^0 and H^{-/+} W^{+/-}. The last\nchannel is compared with the production processes p pbar --> H^{-/+} W^{+/-} X\nand p p --> H^{-/+} W^{+/-} X at the Tevatron and LHC energies, respectively,\nfor large values of tan(beta).\n", "  We present a method to investigate the CP quantum numbers of the Higgs boson\nin the process $e^+ e^- \\to Z\\phi$ at a future linear collider (LC), where\n$\\phi$, a generic Higgs boson, is a mixture of CP-even and CP-odd states. The\nprocedure consist of a comparison of the data with predictions obtained from\nMonte Carlo simulations corresponding to the productions of scalar and\npseudoscalar Higgs and the interference term wich constitutes a distinctive\nsignal of CP violation. We present estimates of the sensitivity of the method\nfrom Monte Carlo studies using hypothetical data samples with a full LC\ndetector simulation taking into account the background signals.\n", "  We explicitly construct in the (1/2,1/2)X(1/2,1/2) representation space the\noperator of the squared Pauli-Lubanski vector and derive from it that the\n-6m^{2}eigensubspace (spin 2 in the rest frame), with well defined parity, is\npinned down by the one sole equation, [\\epsilon_{\\mu\\alpha\\beta\\sigma}\n\\epsilon^{\\mu}_{\\nu\\delta\\rho}p^{\\sigma}p^{\\rho}-m^{2}g_{\\alpha\\beta}g_{\\nu\\del\nta}]h^{\\beta\\delta}=0$.\n", "  It is shown that the neutrino mass matrices in the flavour basis yielding a\nvanishing $U_{e3}$ are characterized by invariance under a class of $Z_2$\nsymmetries. A specific $Z_2$ in this class also leads to a maximal atmospheric\nmixing angle $\\theta_{23}$. The breaking of that $Z_2$ can be parameterized by\ntwo dimensionless quantities, $\\e$ and $\\e'$; the effects of $\\e, \\e' \\neq 0$\nare studied perturbatively and numerically. The induced value of $\\ue3$\nstrongly depends on the neutrino mass hierarchy. We find that $\\ue3$ is less\nthan 0.07 for a normal mass hierarchy, even when $\\e, \\e' \\sim 30 %$. For an\ninverted mass hierarchy $\\ue3$ tends to be around 0.1 but can be as large as\n0.17. In the case of quasi-degenerate neutrinos, $\\ue3$ could be close to its\nexperimental upper bound 0.2. In contrast, $| \\cos{2\\theta_{23}} |$ can always\nreach its experimental upper bound 0.28. We propose a specific model, based on\nelectroweak radiative corrections in the MSSM, for $\\e$ and $\\e'$. In that\nmodel, both $\\ue3$ and $| \\cos{2 \\theta_{23}} |$, could be close to their\nrespective experimental upper bounds if neutrinos are quasi-degenerate.\n", "  In this letter, we show that upper-limits on neutrino mass translate into\nupper-limits on the class of neutrino-matter interactions that can generate\nloop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix. We apply our results to $\\mu$-\nand $\\pi$-decays and derive model-independent limits on six of the ten\nparameters used to parametrize contributions to $\\mu$-decay that do not belong\nto the standard model.\n  These upper-limits provide improved constraints on the five Michel\nparameters,\n  $\\rho,\\xi^\\prime,\\xi^{\\prime\\prime},\\alpha,\\alpha^\\prime$, that exceed PDG\nconstraints by at least one order of magnitude. For $\\pi^0\\to \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ we\nfind for the branching ratio: $B(\\pi^0\\to\\nu \\bar\\nu) < 10^{-10}$.\n", "  We study the Two Higgs Doublet Model of type II, set limits to the parameter\n$\\tan\\beta$ as a function of the mass of the charged Higgs $m_{H}$, and find\ninteresting discovery channels in hadron colliders or muon colliders. We also\nobtain the running coupling constants and discuss Grand Unification.\n  A dissertation submitted to the University of San Francisco-Quito in partial\nfulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Phylosophy.\n", "  A simple and precise method is presented to compare contributions to\nneutrinoless double-beta decay ($\\nbb$-decay) from heavy particle exchange and\nlight Majorana neutrino exchange. This procedure makes no assumptions about the\nmomentum transfer between the two nucleons involved in the $\\nbb$-decay\nprocess. It is shown that for a general particle physics model, the\ncharacteristic $\\nbb$-decay scale $> 4.4$ TeV when all the coupling constants\nare assumed to be natural and of ${\\cal{O}}(1)$.\n", "  We argue that low-energy gluodynamics can be explained in terms of\nsemi-classical Yang-Mills solutions by demonstrating that lattice gluon\ncorrelation functions fit to instanton liquid predictions for low energies and,\nafter cooling, in the whole range.\n", "  The different models of elastic nucleon scattering amplitude will be\ndiscussed. Especially, the preference of the more general approach based on\neikonal model will be summarized in comparison with the West and Yennie\namplitude that played an important role in analyzing corresponding experimental\ndata in the past.\n", "  The wake induced in a hot QCD medium by a high momentum parton (jet\nprecursor) is calculated in the framework of linear response theory. Two\ndifferent scenarios are discussed: a weakly coupled quark gluon plasma (pQGP)\nas described by hard-thermal loop (HTL) perturbation theory and a strongly\ncupled QGP (sQGP) with the properties of a quantum liquid. In the latter case\nthe wake could exhibit a pronounced Mach cone structure. This physical\nmechanism could be important for the understanding of preliminary data from the\nPHENIX and STAR experiments at RHIC on the angular distribution of low-pt\nsecondaries stemming from the away-side jet which indicate maxima at\n$\\Delta\\phi=\\pi \\pm 1.1$.\n", "  We compute the decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons D and D_{s} using a\nlinear combination of finite energy sum rules which minimize the contribution\nof the unknown continuum spectral function. We employ the recent three loop\ncalculation of the pseudoscalar two-point function expanded in powers of the\nrunning charm quark mass. The theoretical uncertainties arising from the QCD\nasymptotic expansion are quite relevant in this case due to the relative small\nscale of the charm mass. We obtain the following results: f_{D}=177 \\pm 21 MeV\nand f_{D_{s}}=205 \\pm 22 MeV. These results, within the error bars, are in good\nagreement with estimates obtained using Borel transform QCD sum rules, but\nsomewhat smaller than results of recent lattice computations.\n", "  Lorentz Invariance (LI) is the founding postulate of Einstein's 1905 theory\nof relativity, and therefore at the heart of all accepted theories of physics.\nIt characterizes the invariance of the laws of physics in inertial frames under\nchanges of velocity or orientation. This central role, and indications from\nunification theories hinting toward a possible LI violation, have motivated\ntremendous experimental efforts to test LI. A comprehensive theoretical\nframework to describe violations of LI has been developed over the last decade:\nthe Lorentz violating Standard Model Extension (SME). It allows a\ncharacterization of LI violations in all fields of present day physics using a\nlarge (but finite) set of parameters which are all zero when LI is satisfied.\nAll classical tests (e.g. Michelson-Morley or Kennedy-Thorndike experiments)\ncan be analyzed in the SME, but it also allows the conception of new types of\nexperiments, not thought of previously. We have carried out such a conceptually\nnew LI test, by comparing particular atomic transitions (particular\norientations of the involved nuclear spins) in the $^{133}$Cs atom using a cold\natomic fountain clock. This allows us to test LI in a previously largely\nunexplored region of the SME parameter space, corresponding to first\nmeasurements of four proton parameters and an improvement by 11 and 12 orders\nof magnitude on the determination of four others. In spite of the attained\naccuracies, and of having extended the search into a new region of the SME, we\nstill find no indication of LI violation.\n", "  We present results of a simulation of 2 flavour QCD on a $16^3\\times4$\nlattice using p4-improved staggered fermions with bare quark mass $m/T=0.4$.\nDerivatives of the thermodynamic grand canonical partition function\n$Z(V,T,\\mu_u,\\mu_d)$ with respect to chemical potentials $\\mu_{u,d}$ for\ndifferent quark flavours are calculated up to sixth order, enabling estimates\nof the pressure and the quark number density as well as the chiral condensate\nand various susceptibilities as functions of $\\mu_{u,d}$ via Taylor series\nexpansion. Results are compared to high temperature perturbation theory as well\nas a hadron resonance gas model. We also analyze baryon as well as isospin\nfluctuations and discuss the relation to the chiral critical point in the QCD\nphase diagram. We moreover discuss the dependence of the heavy quark free\nenergy on the chemical potential.\n", "  The conflict between cononical commutation relation and gauge invariance,\nwhich both the momentum and angular momentum of quark and gluon should satisfy,\nis clarified. The quantum version of gauge invariance is studied. The gauge\nindependence of the matrix elements of quark momentum and angular momentum\noperators between physical states are proved. We suggest to use the canonical\nquark momentum and angular momentum distributions to describe the nucleon\ninternal structure in order to establish an internal consistent description of\nhadron spectroscopy and hadron structure. The same problem for the atomic\nspectroscopy and structure is discussed.\n", "  We present complete analytical ${\\mathcal O}(\\epsilon^2)$ results on the\none-loop amplitudes relevant for the NNLO quark-parton model description of the\nhadroproduction of heavy quarks as given by the so-called loop-by-loop\ncontributions. All results of the perturbative calculation are given in the\ndimensional regularization scheme. These one-loop amplitudes can also be used\nas input in the determination of the corresponding NNLO cross sections for\nheavy flavor photoproduction, and in photon-photon reactions.\n", "  In a recent paper we have presented results for a set of massive scalar\none-loop master integrals needed in the NNLO parton model description of the\nhadroproduction of heavy flavors. The one--loop integrals were evaluated in\n$n=4-2\\ep$ dimension and the results were presented in terms of a Laurent\nseries expansion up to ${\\cal O}(\\ep^2)$. We found that some of the $\\ep^2$\ncoefficients contain a new class of functions which we termed the $L$\nfunctions. The $L$ functions are defined in terms of one--dimensional integrals\ninvolving products of logarithm and dilogarithm functions. In this paper we\nderive a complete set of algebraic relations that allow one to convert the $L$\nfunctions of our previous approach to a sum of classical and multiple\npolylogarithms. Using these results we are now able to present the $\\ep^2$\ncoefficients of the one-loop master integrals in terms of classical and\nmultiple polylogarithms.\n", "  In this work we consider a left-right model containing mirror fermions with\ngauge group SU(3)$_{C} \\otimes SU(2)_{L} \\otimes SU(2)_{R} \\otimes\nU(1)_{Y^\\prime}$. The model has several free parameters which here we have\ncalculated by using the recent values for the squared-neutrino mass\ndifferences. Lower bound for the mirror vacuum expectation value helped us to\nobtain crude estimations for some of these parameters. Also we estimate the\norder of magnitude of the masses of the standard and mirror neutrinos.\n"]}
