It is found that the SOC-induced\nband splittings near their Fermi energies can be significantly enhanced to the\norder of 10$^{-2}$ eV from the original about 10$^{-6}$ eV of the pure raphene,\nwhich is comparable to those found in the diamond and even the archetypal\nsemiconductors. And two different mechanisms are proposed to explain the SOC\nenhancements in these two systems. The huge SOC enhancements are found to come\nnot only from the sp$^3$ hybridization of carbon atoms, but also from the\nlarger intrinsic SOC of the fluorine atom than the carbon one. We hope many\ninteresting phenomena caused by the SOCs (e.g. the spin Hall effect) can be\nobserved experimentally in these systems.\n", "  We demonstrate the emergence of self-organized structures in the course of\nthe relaxation of an initially excited, dissipative and finite chain of\ninteracting particles in a periodic potential towards its many particle\nequilibrium configuration. Specifically we observe a transition from an in\nphase correlated motion via phase randomized oscillations towards oscillations\nwith a phase difference $\\pi$ between adjacent particles thereby yielding the\ngrowth of long time transient spatiotemporal oscillation patterns. Parameter\nmodifications allow for designing these patterns, including steady states and\neven states that combine in phase and correlated out of phase oscillations\nalong the chain. The complex relaxation dynamics is based on finite size\neffects together with an evolution running from the nonlinear to the linear\nregime thereby providing a highly unbalanced population of the center of mass\nand relative motion.\n", "  In 1993 Mahadevan and Keller used the Kirchhoff rod theory to predict the\nshape of a M\\\"obius band. Starting from the solution for a square cross-section\n(isotropic), they employ numerical continuation in the cross-sectional aspect\nratio in order to approach the solution for a thin strip. Certain smoothly\nvarying configurations are obtained. More recently in 2007, Starostin and van\nder Heijden pointed out that an actual M\\\"obius band \"localizes\" into a nearly\nflat triangular configuration as the ratio of the strip width to center-line\ncircumference is no longer small. Accordingly they return to the developable,\nthin-plate model of Sadowsky and Wunderlich, obtaining such localized shapes.\nIn this work we strike a middle ground between these two approaches. We employ\nthe standard two-director (special) Cosserat model, and we also use the\ncross-sectional aspect ratio as a numerical continuation parameter.\nNonetheless, we are able to capture both the smoothly varying shapes and the\nlocalized, nearly triangular configurations. Our point of departure is that we\ndo not always employ the strength-of-materials formula for the torsional\nstiffness - a standard feature of the Kirchhoff theory. Our key observation\ncomes from the usual Cosserat ansatz in light of developability, suggesting an\nincreasing torsional stiffness ratio (as well as one increasing bending\nstiffness ratio) as the thickness becomes small. We demonstrate that the\nclosed-loop configurations we obtain are stable with respect to small\nperturbations.\n", "  Finding \\cp~violation (\\CPV ) in 1964 produced a real revolution in the\nfundamental dynamics, although the community did not understand it right away.\nThe paper by Kobayashi \\& Maskawa \\cite{KM} appeared in 1973 to describe\n\\CPV~in classes of three (or more) families of quarks, non-minimal Higgs'\ndynamics and/or charged right-handed currents. The Standard Model is defined\nnow with three families of quarks. It can describe the measured \\cp~ \\&\n\\ot~violation in kaon and $B$ mesons at least as the leading source. None has\nbeen found in baryons, charm mesons, top quarks and EDMs -- except from `hot'\nnews from LHCb data about {\\bf T}-odd moment in $\\Lambda_b^0 \\to p\n\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ \\cite{LHCbtalk}. We have failed the explain our matter vs.\nanti-matter huge asymmetry. Even when there is no obvious connections with that\nasymmetry, it makes sense to probe \\CPV~for the signs of New Dynamics \\& their\nfeatures. Furthermore we have to measure regional \\CPV~in many-body final\nstates with accuracy. I discuss EDMs, axion's impact on cosmology \\& its\nconnection with Dark Matter; finally I talk about \\CPV~in leptonic dynamics.\n", "  We re-analyze the detectability of large scale dark flow (or local bulk flow)\nwith respect to the CMB background based upon the redshift-distance relation\nfor Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). We made two independent analyses: one based\nupon identifying the three Cartesian velocity components; and the other based\nupon the cosine dependence of the deviation from Hubble flow on the sky. We\napply these analyses to the Union2.1 SN Ia data and to the SDSS-II supernova\nsurvey. For both methods, results for low redshift, $z < 0.05$, are consistent\nwith previous searches. We find a local bulk flow of $v_{\\rm bf} \\sim 300$ km\ns$^{-1}$ in the direction of $(l,b) \\sim (270, 35)^{\\circ}$. However, the\nsearch for a dark flow at $z>0.05$ is inconclusive. Based upon simulated data\nsets, we deduce that the difficulty in detecting a dark flow at high redshifts\narises mostly from the observational error in the distance modulus. Thus, even\nif it exists, a dark flow is not detectable at large redshift with current SN\nIa data sets. We estimate that a detection would require both significant sky\ncoverage of SN Ia out to $z = 0.3$ and a reduction in the effective distance\nmodulus error from 0.2 mag to $\\lesssim 0.02$ mag. We estimate that a greatly\nexpanded data sample of $\\sim 10^4$ SN Ia might detect a dark flow as small as\n300 km s$^{-1}$ out to $z = 0.3$ even with a distance modulus error of $0.2$\nmag. This may be achievable in a next generation large survey like LSST.\n", "  We consider a formulation of Yang-Mills theory where the gauge field is\nvalued on an octonionic algebra and the gauge transformation is the group of\nautomorphisms of it. We show, under mild assumptions, that the only possible\ngauge formulations are the usual $\\mathfrak{su}(2)$ or $\\mathfrak{u}(1)$\nYang-Mills theories.\n", "  We demonstrate that repulsive power law interactions can induce directed\ntransport of particles in dissipative, ac-driven periodic potentials, in\nregimes where the underlying noninteracting system exhibits localized\noscillations. Contrasting the well-established single particle ratchet\nmechanism, this interaction induced transport is based on the collective\nbehaviour of the interacting particles yielding a spatiotemporal nonequilibrium\npattern comprising persistent travelling excitations.\n", "  We consider here special Poisson brackets given by the \"averaging\" of local\nmulti-dimensional Poisson brackets in the Whitham method. For the brackets of\nthis kind it is natural to ask about their canonical forms, which can be\nobtained after transformations preserving the \"physical meaning\" of the field\nvariables. We show here that the averaged bracket can always be written in the\ncanonical form after a transformation of \"Hydrodynamic Type\" in the case of\nabsence of annihilators of initial bracket. However, in general case the\nsituation is more complicated. As we show here, in more general case the\naveraged bracket can be transformed to a \"pseudo-canonical\" form under some\nspecial (\"physical\") requirements on the initial bracket.\n", "  In this paper we introduce quantum Latin squares, combinatorial quantum\nobjects which generalize classical Latin squares, and investigate their\napplications in quantum computer science. Our main results are on applications\nto unitary error bases (UEBs), basic structures in quantum information which\nlie at the heart of procedures such as teleportation, dense coding and error\ncorrection. We present a new method for constructing a UEB from a quantum Latin\nsquare equipped with extra data. Developing construction techniques for UEBs\nhas been a major activity in quantum computation, with three primary methods\nproposed: shift-and-multiply, Hadamard, and algebraic. We show that our new\napproach simultaneously generalizes the shift-and-multiply and Hadamard\nmethods. Furthermore, we explicitly construct a UEB using our technique which\nwe prove cannot be obtained from any of these existing methods.\n", "  We report the observation of the twisted decay of quadruply charged vortices\nin an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Supporting numerical simulations show\nthat the singly-charged vortices, which result from the decay of a\nmulti-charged vortex, twist around intertwined in the shape of helical Kelvin\nwaves. Finally, we propose to apply this effect to generate an almost isotropic\nstate of turbulence which we characterize in terms of the velocity statistics.\n", "  The purpose of these notes is to give a short survey of an interesting\nconnection between partition functions of supersymmetric gauge theories and\nhypergeometric functions and to present the recent progress in this direction.\n", "  We predict that vertical transport in heterostructures formed by twisted\ngraphene layers can exhibit a unique bistability mechanism. Intrinsically\nbistable $I$-$V$ characteristics arise from resonant tunneling and interlayer\ncharge coupling, enabling multiple stable states in the sequential tunneling\nregime. We consider a simple trilayer architecture, with the outer layers\nacting as the source and drain and the middle layer floating. Under bias, the\nmiddle layer can be either resonant or non-resonant with the source and drain\nlayers. The bistability is controlled by geometric device parameters easily\ntunable in experiments. The nanoscale architecture can enable uniquely fast\nswitching times.\n", "  We examine square and kagome artificial spin ice for colloids confined in\narrays of double-well traps. Unlike magnetic artificial spin ices, colloidal\nand vortex artificial spin ice realizations allow creation of doping sites\nthrough double occupation of individual traps. We find that doping square and\nkagome ice geometries produces opposite effects. For square ice, doping creates\nlocal excitations in the ground state configuration that produce a local\nmelting effect as the temperature is raised. In contrast, the kagome ice ground\nstate can absorb the doping charge without generating non-ground-state\nexcitations, while at elevated temperatures the hopping of individual colloids\nis suppressed near the doping sites. These results indicate that in the square\nice, doping adds degeneracy to the ordered ground state and creates local weak\nspots, while in the kagome ice, which has a highly degenerate ground state,\ndoping locally decreases the degeneracy and creates local hard regions.\n", "  We consider the problem of counting and of listing topologically inequivalent\n\"planar\" {4-valent} maps with a single component and a given number n of\nvertices. This enables us to count and to tabulate immersions of a circle in a\nsphere (spherical curves), extending results by Arnold and followers. Different\noptions where the circle and/or the sphere are/is oriented are considered in\nturn, following Arnold's classification of the different types of symmetries.\nWe also consider the case of bicolourable and bicoloured maps or immersions,\nwhere faces are bicoloured. Our method extends to immersions of a circle in a\nhigher genus Riemann surface. There the bicolourability is no longer automatic\nand has to be assumed. We thus have two separate countings in non zero genus,\nthat of bicolourable maps and that of general maps. We use a classical method\nof encoding maps in terms of permutations, on which the constraints of\n\"one-componentness\" and of a given genus may be applied. Depending on the\norientation issue and on the bicolourability assumption, permutations for a map\nwith n vertices live in S(4n) or in S(2n). In a nutshell, our method reduces to\nthe counting (or listing) of orbits of certain subset of S(4n) (resp. S(2n))\nunder the action of the centralizer of a certain element of S(4n) (resp.\nS(2n)). This is achieved either by appealing to a formula by Frobenius or by a\ndirect enumeration of these orbits. Applications to knot theory are briefly\nmentioned.\n", "  Various inflationary scenarios can often be distinguished from one another by\nlooking at the squeezed limit behavior of correlation functions. Therefore, it\nis useful to have a framework designed to study this limit in a more systematic\nand efficient way. We propose using an expansion in terms of weakly coupled\nsuper-horizon degrees of freedom, which is argued to generically exist in a\nnear de Sitter space-time. The modes have a simple factorized form which leads\nto factorization of the squeezed-limit correlation functions with power-law\nbehavior in $k_{\\rm long}/k_{\\rm short}$. This approach reproduces the known\nresults in single-, quasi-single-, and multi-field inflationary models.\nHowever, it is applicable even if, unlike the above examples, the additional\ndegrees of freedom are not weakly coupled at sub-horizon scales. Stronger\nresults are derived in two-field (or sufficiently symmetric multi-field)\ninflationary models. We discuss the observability of the non-Gaussian 3-point\nfunction in the large-scale structure surveys, and argue that the squeezed\nlimit behavior has a higher detectability chance than equilateral behavior when\nit scales as $(k_{\\rm long}/k_{\\rm short})^\\Delta$ with $\\Delta<1$ -- where\nlocal non-Gaussianity corresponds to $\\Delta=0$.\n", "  We demonstrate that migration away from self-produced chemicals\n(chemorepulsion) generates a generic route to clustering and pattern formation\namong self-propelled colloids. The clustering instability can be caused either\nby anisotropic chemical production, or by a delayed orientational response to\nchanges of the chemical environment. In each case, chemorepulsion creates\nclusters of a self-limiting area which grows linearly with self-propulsion\nspeed. This agrees with recent observations of dynamic clusters in Janus\ncolloids (albeit not yet known to be chemorepulsive). More generally, our\nresults could inform design principles for the self-assembly of chemorepulsive\nsynthetic swimmers and/or bacteria into nonequilibrium patterns.\n", "  We present our study of kaonic three-body $\\overset{\\_}{K}NN$,\n$\\overset{\\_}{K}\\overset{\\_}{K}N$ and $KK\\overset{\\_}{K}$ and four-body\n$\\overset{\\_}{K}% NNN $, $\\ $and $\\overset{\\_}{K}\\overset{\\_}{K}NN$ clusters\nwithin the framework of a potential model using the method of hyperspherical\nfunctions in momentum representation. To perform a numerical calculations for\nthe bound state energy of the light kaonic system, we use a set of different\npotentials for the nucleon-nucleon and $\\overset{\\_}{K}N$ interactions, as well\nas for the kaon-kaon interaction. The calculations show that a quasibound state\nenergy is not sensitive to the $NN$ interaction, and it shows very strong\ndependence on the $\\overset{\\_}{K}N$ potential. We also compare our results\nwith those obtained using different theoretical approaches. The theoretical\ndiscrepancies in the binding energy and width for the lightest kaonic system\nrelated to the different $NN$ and $\\overset{\\_% }{K}N$ interactions are\naddressed.\n", "  The localization characters of the first-order rogue wave (RW) solution $u$\nof the Kundu-Eckhaus equation is studied in this paper.\n  We discover a full process of the evolution for the contour line with height\n$c^2+d$ along the orthogonal direction of the ($t,x$)-plane for a first-order\nRW $|u|^2$: A point at height $9c^2$ generates a convex curve for $3c^2\\leq\nd<8c^2$, whereas it becomes a concave curve for $0<d<3c^2$, next it reduces to\na hyperbola on asymptotic plane (i.e. equivalently $d=0$), and the two branches\nof the hyperbola become two separate convex curves when $-c^2<d<0$, and finally\nthey reduce to two separate points at $d=-c^2$. Using the contour line method,\nthe length, width, and area of the RW at height $c^2+d (0<d<8c^2)$ , i.e. above\nthe asymptotic plane, are defined. We study the evolutions of three\nabove-mentioned localization characters on $d$ through analytical and visual\nmethods. The phase difference between the Kundu-Eckhaus and the nonlinear\nSchrodinger equation is also given by an explicit formula.\n", "  Binary-outcome measurements allow to determine whether a multi-level quantum\nsystem is in a certain state while preserving quantum coherence between all\northogonal states. In this paper, we explore different regimes of the\ndispersive readout of a three-level superconducting quantum system coupled to a\nmicrowave cavity in order to implement binary-outcome measurements. By\ndesigning identical cavity frequency shifts for the first and second excited\nstates of the system, we realize strong projective binary-outcome measurements\nonto its ground state with a fidelity of $94.3\\%$. Complemented with standard\nmicrowave control and low-noise parametric amplification, this scheme enables\nthe quantum non-demolition detection of leakage errors and can be used to\ncreate sets of compatible measurements to reveal the contextual nature of\nsuperconducting circuits.\n", "  The nature of single particle classical phase space trajectories in Rindler\nspace have been studied. It has been shown that only a small portion of the\nphase space is accessible to the particles, whereas the major part of the phase\nspace region is completely forbidden. It has also been noticed that the area /\nvolume of the forbidden region of phase space increases with the increase in\nthe strength of gravitational field. The physical significance of such\nsqueezing of phase space in strong gravitational field has been discussed.\n", "  Our three-dimensional hydro-dynamical simulations of starbursts examine the\nformation of superbubbles over a range of driving luminosities and mass\nloadings that determine superbubble growth and wind velocity. From this we\ndetermine the relationship between the velocity of a galactic wind and the\npower of the starburst. We find a threshold for the formation of a wind, above\nwhich the speed of the wind is not affected by grid resolution or the\ntemperature floor of our radiative cooling. We investigate the effect two\ndifferent temperature floors in our radiative cooling prescription have on wind\nkinematics and content. We find that cooling to $10$ K instead of to $10^4$ K\nincreases the mass fraction of cold neutral and hot X-ray gas in the galactic\nwind while halving that in warm H$\\alpha$. Our simulations show the mass of\ncold gas transported into the lower halo does not depend on the starburst\nstrength. Optically bright filaments form at the edge of merging superbubbles,\nor where a cold dense cloud has been disrupted by the wind. Filaments formed by\nmerging superbubbles will persist and grow to $>400$ pc in length if anchored\nto a star forming complex. Filaments embedded in the hot galactic wind contain\nwarm and cold gas that moves $300-1200$ km s$^{-1}$ slower than the surrounding\nwind, with the coldest gas hardly moving with respect to the galaxy. Warm and\ncold matter in the galactic wind show asymmetric absorption profiles consistent\nwith observations, with a thin tail up to the wind velocity.\n", "  We introduce Meraxes, a new, purpose-built semi-analytic galaxy formation\nmodel designed for studying galaxy growth during reionization. Meraxes is the\nfirst model of its type to include a temporally and spatially coupled treatment\nof reionization and is built upon a custom (100 Mpc)$^3$ N-body simulation with\nhigh temporal and mass resolution, allowing us to resolve the galaxy and star\nformation physics relevant to early galaxy formation. Our fiducial model with\nsupernova feedback reproduces the observed optical depth to electron scattering\nand evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function between $z$=5 and 7,\npredicting that a broad range of halo masses contribute to reionization. Using\na constant escape fraction and global recombination rate, our model is unable\nto simultaneously match the observed ionizing emissivity at $z{\\lesssim}6$.\nHowever, the use of an evolving escape fraction of 0.05-0.1 at $z{\\sim}6$,\nincreasing towards higher redshift, is able to satisfy these three constraints.\nWe also demonstrate that photoionization suppression of low mass galaxy\nformation during reionization has only a small effect on the ionization history\nof the inter-galactic medium. This lack of `self-regulation' arises due to the\nalready efficient quenching of star formation by supernova feedback. It is only\nin models with gas supply-limited star formation that reionization feedback is\neffective at regulating galaxy growth. We similarly find that reionization has\nonly a small effect on the stellar mass function, with no observationally\ndetectable imprint at $M_{\\rm *}{>}10^{7.5}\\,{\\rm M_{{\\odot}}}$. However,\npatchy reionization has significant effects on individual galaxy masses, with\nvariations of factors of 2-3 at $z$=5 that correlate with environment.\n", "  We show that the spatial distribution of the energy density of optimally\nshaped waves inside a scattering medium can be described by considering only a\nfew of the lowest eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation. Taking into account\nonly the fundamental eigenfunction, the total internal energy inside the sample\nis underestimated by only 2%. The spatial distribution of the shaped energy\ndensity is very similar to the fundamental eigenfunction, up to a cosine\ndistance of about 0.01. We obtained the energy density inside a quasi-1D\ndisordered waveguide by numerical calculation of the joined scattering matrix.\nComputing the transmission-averaged energy density over all transmission\nchannels yields the ensemble averaged energy density of shaped waves. From the\naveraged energy density obtained, we reconstruct its spatial distribution using\nthe eigenfunctions of the diffusion equation. The results from our study have\nexciting applications in controlled biomedical imaging, efficient light\nharvesting in solar cells, enhanced energy conversion in solid-state lighting,\nand low threshold random lasers.\n", "  In this paper, we present a model of transitioning universe with minimal\ninteraction between perfect fluid and anisotropic dark energy in Bianchi I\nspace-time. The two sources are assumed to minimally interacted and therefore\ntheir energy momentum tensors are conserved separately. The explicit expression\nfor average scale factor are considered in hybrid form that gives time varying\ndeceleration parameter which describes both the early and late time physical\nfeatures of universe. We also discuss the physical and geometrical properties\nof the model derived in this paper. The solution is interesting physically as\nit explain accelerating universe as well as singularity free universe.\n", "  It is commonly believed that the ringdown signal from a binary coalescence\nprovides a conclusive proof for the formation of an event horizon after the\nmerger. This expectation is based on the assumption that the ringdown waveform\nat intermediate times is dominated by the quasinormal modes of the final\nobject. We point out that this assumption should be taken with great care, and\nthat very compact objects with a light ring will display a similar ringdown\nstage, even when their quasinormal-mode spectrum is completely different from\nthat of a black hole. In other words, universal ringdown waveforms indicate the\npresence of light rings, rather than of horizons. Only precision observations\nof the late-time ringdown signal, where the differences in the quasinormal-mode\nspectrum eventually show up, can be used to rule out exotic alternatives to\nblack holes and to test quantum effects at the horizon scale.\n", "  The aim of this paper is the study of thermal vacuum condensate for scalar\nand fermion fields. We analyze the thermal states at the temperature of the\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) and we show that the vacuum expectation value\nof the energy momentum tensor density of photon fields reproduces the energy\ndensity and pressure of the CMB. We perform the computations in the formal\nframework of the thermo field dynamics. We also consider the case of neutrinos\nand thermal states at the temperature of the neutrino cosmic background.\nConsistency with the estimated lower bound of the sum of the active neutrino\nmasses is verified. In the boson sector, non trivial contribution to the energy\nof the universe is given by particles of masses of the order of $10^{-4}eV$\ncompatible with the ones of the axion-like particles. The fractal self-similar\nstructure of the thermal radiation is also discussed and related to the\ncoherent structure of the thermal vacuum.\n", "  We give, in some detail, a critical overview over recent work towards\nderiving a cosmological phenomenology from the fundamental quantum dynamics of\ngroup field theory (GFT), based on the picture of a macroscopic universe as a\n\"condensate\" of a large number of quanta of geometry which are given by\nexcitations of the GFT field over a \"no-space\" vacuum. We emphasise conceptual\nfoundations, relations to other research programmes in GFT and the wider\ncontext of loop quantum gravity (LQG), and connections to the quantum physics\nof real Bose-Einstein condensates. We show how to extract an effective dynamics\nfor GFT condensates from the microscopic GFT physics, and how to compare it\nwith predictions of more conventional quantum cosmology models, in particular\nloop quantum cosmology (LQC). No detailed familiarity with the GFT formalism is\nassumed.\n", "  We propose the modified version of the canonical energy which was introduced\noriginally by Hollands and Wald. Our construction depends only on the\nEuler-Lagrange expression of the system and thus is independent of the\nambiguity in the Lagrangian. After some comments on our construction, we\nbriefly mention on the relevance of our construction to the boundary\ninformation metric in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also study\nthe stability of three-dimensional hairy extremal black holes by using our\nconstruction.\n", "  We consider the inclusive production of a Higgs boson in gluon-fusion and we\nstudy the impact of threshold resummation at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy (N$^3$LL) on the recently computed fixed-order prediction\nat next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO). We propose a conservative,\nyet robust way of estimating the perturbative uncertainty from missing higher\n(fixed- or logarithmic-) orders. We compare our results with two other\ndifferent methods of estimating the uncertainty from missing higher orders: the\nCacciari-Houdeau Bayesian approach to theory errors, and the use of algorithms\nto accelerate the convergence of the perturbative series. We confirm that the\nbest convergence happens at $\\mu_R=\\mu_F=m_H\\,/\\,2$, and we conclude that a\nreliable estimate of the uncertainty from missing higher orders on the Higgs\ncross section at 13 TeV is approximately $\\pm4$%.\n", "  We report the measurement of the emission time profile of scintillation from\ngamma-ray induced events in the XMASS-I 832 kg liquid xenon scintillation\ndetector. Decay time constant was derived from a comparison of scintillation\nphoton timing distributions between the observed data and simulated samples in\norder to take into account optical processes such as absorption and scattering\nin liquid xenon. Calibration data of radioactive sources, $^{55}$Fe,\n$^{241}$Am, and $^{57}$Co were used to obtain the decay time constant. Assuming\ntwo decay components, $\\tau_1$ and $\\tau_2$, the decay time constant $\\tau_2$\nincreased from 27.9 ns to 37.0 ns as the gamma-ray energy increased from 5.9\nkeV to 122 keV. The accuracy of the measurement was better than 1.5 ns at all\nenergy levels. A fast decay component with $\\tau_1 \\sim 2$ ns was necessary to\nreproduce data. Energy dependencies of $\\tau_2$ and the fraction of the fast\ndecay component were studied as a function of the kinetic energy of electrons\ninduced by gamma-rays. The obtained data almost reproduced previously reported\nresults and extended them to the lower energy region relevant to direct dark\nmatter searches.\n", "  Recently, the extremely large magnetoresistance observed in transition metal\ntelluride, like WTe$_2$, attracted much attention because of the potential\napplications in magnetic sensor. Here we report the observation of extremely\nlarge magnetoresistance as 3.0$\\times$10$^4$ % measured at 2 K and 9 T magnetic\nfield aligned along [001]-ZrSiS. The significant magnetoresistance change\n(~1.4$\\times$10$^4$ %) can be obtained when the magnetic field is titled from\n[001] to [011]-ZrSiS. These abnormal magnetoresistance behaviors in ZrSiS can\nbe understood by electron-hole compensation and the open orbital of Fermi\nsurface. Because of these superior MR properties, ZrSiS may be used in the\nnovel magnetic sensors.\n", "  Using a data set of 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ taken at a center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we\nmeasure the process $e^+e^-\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\gamma\\rightarrow\n\\mu^+\\mu^-\\gamma$ and determine the product of the branching fraction and the\nelectronic width $\\mathcal B_{\\mu\\mu}\\cdot \\Gamma_{ee} = (333.4 \\pm 2.5_{\\rm\nstat} \\pm 4.4_{\\rm sys})$~eV. Using the earlier-published BESIII result for\n$\\mathcal B_{\\mu\\mu}$ = (5.973 $\\pm$ 0.007$_{\\rm stat}$ $\\pm$ 0.037$_{\\rm\nsys}$)\\%, we derive the $J/\\psi$ electronic width $\\Gamma_{ee}$~= (5.58 $\\pm$\n0.05$_{\\rm stat}$ $\\pm$ 0.08$_{\\rm sys}$) keV.\n", "  We investigate numerically kink collisions in a $1+1$ dimensional scalar\nfield theory with multiple vacua. The domain wall model we are interested in\ninvolves two scalar fields and a potential term built from an asymmetric double\nwell and (double) sine-Gordon potential together with an interaction term.\nDepending on the initial kink setup and impact velocities, the model allows for\na wide range of scattering behaviours. Kinks can repel each other, annihilate,\nform true or false domain walls and reflect off each other.\n", "  We analyzed low-background data from the CRESST-II experiment with a total\nnet exposure of 730 kg days to extract limits on double electron capture\nprocesses. We established new limits for $^{40}$Ca with\n$T_{1/2}^{2v2K}>9.9\\times10^{21}$ y and $T_{1/2}^{0v2EC}>1.4\\times10^{22}$ y\nand for $^{180}$W with T$_{1/2}^{2v2K}>3.1\\times10^{19}$ y and\n$T_{1/2}^{0v2EC}>9.4\\times10^{18}$ y at 90% CL. Depending on the process, these\nvalues improve the currently best limits by a factor of $\\sim$1.4-30.\n", "  We analyze the latest \\emph{Suzaku} observation of the bright neutron star\nlow-mass X-ray binary Serpens X-1 taken in 2013 October and 2014 April. The\nobservation was taken using the burst mode and only suffered mild pile-up\neffects. A broad iron line is clearly detected in the X-ray spectrum. We test\ndifferent models and find that the iron line is asymmetric and best interpreted\nby relativistic reflection. The relativistically broadened iron line is\ngenerally believed to originate from the innermost regions of the accretion\ndisk, where strong gravity causes a series of special and general relativistic\neffects. The iron line profile indicates an inner radius of $\\sim8$ $R_{\\rm\nG}$, which gives an upper limit on the size of the neutron star. The asymmetric\niron line has been observed in a number of previous observations, which gives\nseveral inner radius measurements at different flux states. We find that the\ninner radius of Serpens X-1 does not evolve significantly over the range of\n$L/L_{\\rm Edd}\\sim0.4-0.6$, and the lack of flux dependence of the inner radius\nimplies that the accretion disk may be truncated outside the innermost stable\ncircular orbit by the boundary layer rather than the stellar magnetic field.\n", "  We find that both continuous and discontinuous hexatic-liquid transitions can\nhappen in the melting of two-dimensional solids of soft-core disks. For three\ntypical model systems, Hertzian, harmonic, and Gaussian-core models, we observe\nthe same scenarios. These systems exhibit reentrant crystallization (melting)\nwith a maximum melting temperature $T_m$ happening at a crossover density\n$\\rho_m$. The hexatic-liquid transition at a density smaller than $\\rho_m$ is\ndiscontinuous. Liquid and hexatic phases coexist in a density interval, which\nbecomes narrower with increasing temperature and tends to vanish approximately\nat $T_m$. Above $\\rho_m$, the transition is continuous, in agreement with the\nKosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young theory. For these soft-core systems,\nthe nature of the hexatic-liquid transition depends on density (pressure), with\nthe melting at $\\rho_m$ being a plausible transition point from discontinuous\nto continuous hexatic-liquid transition.\n", "  Weyl semimetals and nodal line semimetals are characterized by linear band\ntouching at zero-dimensional points and one-dimensional lines, respectively. We\npredict that a circularly polarized light drives nodal line semimetals into\nWeyl semimetals. The Floquet Weyl points thus obtained are tunable by the\nincident light, which enables investigations of them in a highly controllable\nmanner. The transition from nodal line semimetals to Weyl semimetals is\naccompanied by the emergence of a large and tunable anomalous Hall\nconductivity. Our predictions are experimentally testable by transport\nmeasurement in film samples or by pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy.\n", "  We demonstrate that active rotations in chemically signalling particles, such\nas autochemotactic {\\it E. coli} close to walls, create a route for pattern\nformation based on a nonlinear yet deterministic instability mechanism. For\nslow rotations, we find a transient persistence of the uniform state, followed\nby a sudden formation of clusters contingent on locking of the average\npropulsion direction by chemotaxis. These clusters coarsen, which results in\nphase separation into a dense and a dilute region. Faster rotations arrest\nphase separation leading to a global travelling wave of rotors with\nsynchronized roto-translational motion. Our results elucidate the physics\nresulting from the competition of two generic paradigms in active matter,\nchemotaxis and active rotations, and show that the latter provides a tool to\ndesign programmable self-assembly of active matter, for example to control\ncoarsening.\n", "  We calculate a general effective stress-energy tensor induced by cosmological\ninhomogeneity in effective theories of gravity where the action is\nTaylor-expandable in the Riemann tensor and covariant derivatives of the\nRiemann tensor. This is of interest as an effective fluid that might provide an\nalternative to the cosmological constant, but it also applies to gravitational\nwaves. We use an adaptation of Green and Wald's weak-averaging framework, which\naverages over perturbations in the field equation where the perturbation length\nscales are small compared to the averaging scale. In this adaptation, the\nlength scale of the effective theory, $1/M$, is also taken to be small compared\nwith the averaging scale. This ensures that the perturbation length scales\nremain in fixed proportion to the length scale of the effective theory as the\ncosmological averaging scale is taken to be large. We find that backreaction\nfrom higher-derivative terms in the effective action can continue to be\nimportant in the late universe, given a source of sufficiently high-frequency\nmetric perturbations. This backreaction might also provide a window on exotic\nparticle physics in the far ultraviolet.\n", "  Gravitational perturbations in multi-planet systems caused by an accompanying\nstar are the subject of this investigation. Our dynamical model is based on the\nbinary star HD41004 AB where a giant planet orbits HD41004 A. We modify the\norbital parameters of this system and analyze the motion of a hypothetical\ntest-planet surrounding HD41004 A on an interior orbit to the detected giant\nplanet. Our numerical computations indicate perturbations due to mean motion\nand secular resonances. The locations of these resonances are usually connected\nto high eccentricity and highly inclined motion depending strongly on the\nbinary-planet architecture.As the positions of mean motion resonances can\neasily be determined, the main purpose of this study is to present a new\nsemi-analytical method to determine the location of a secular resonance without\nhuge computational effort.\n", "  In our recent paper (Li and Batchelor J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 48, 454005\n(2015)) we obtained exceptional points in the eigenspectrum of the generalized\nRabi model in terms of a set of algebraic equations. We also gave a proof for\nthe number of roots of the constraint polynomials defining these exceptional\nsolutions as a function of the system parameters and discussed the number of\ncrossing points in the eigenspectrum. This approach however, only covered a\nsubset of all exceptional points in the eigenspectrum. In this addendum, we\nclarify the distinction between the exceptional parts of the eigenspectrum for\nthis model and discuss the subset of exceptional points not determined in our\npaper.\n", "  Background: Nuclear short-range correlations (SRCs) are corrections to\nmean-field wave functions connected with the short-distance behavior of the\nnucleon-nucleon interaction. These SRCs provide corrections to lepton- nucleus\ncross sections as computed in the impulse approximation (IA). Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order. Results: The model is compared with\nelectron-scattering data, and two-particle two-hole responses are presented for\nneutrino scattering. The contributions from the vector and axial-vector parts\nof the nuclear current as well as the central, tensor and spin-isospin part of\nthe SRCs are studied. Conclusions: Nuclear SRCs affect the 1N knockout channel\nand give rise to 2N knockout. The exclusive neutrino-induced 2N knockout cross\nsection of SRC pairs is shown and the 2N knockout contribution to the QE signal\nis calculated. The strength occurs as a broad background which extends into the\ndip region.\n", "  We report angle-resolved electron transmission measurements through\nfreestanding graphene sheets in the energy range of 18 to 30 eV above the Fermi\nlevel. The measurements are carried out in a low-energy electron point source\nmicroscope, which allows simultaneously probing the transmission for a large\nangular range. The characteristics of low-energy electron transmission through\ngraphene depend on its electronic structure above the vacuum level. The\nexperimental technique described here allows mapping the unoccupied band\nstructure of freestanding two-dimensional materials as a function of energy and\nprobing angle, respectively in-plane momentum. Our experimental findings are\nconsistent with theoretical predictions of a resonance in the band structure of\ngraphene above the vacuum level [V. U. Nazarov, E. E. Krasovskii, and V. M.\nSilkin, Physical Review B 87, 041405 (2013)].\n", "  Loss of coherence with increasing excitation amplitudes and spatial size\nmodulation is a fundamental problem in designing Raman fiber lasers. While it\nis known that ramping up laser pump power increases the amplitude of stochastic\nexcitations, such higher energy inputs can also lead to a transition from a\nlinearly stable coherent laminar regime to a non-desirable disordered turbulent\nstate. This report presents a new statistical methodology, based on first\npassage statistics, that classifies lasing regimes in Raman fiber lasers,\nthereby leading to a fast and highly accurate identification of a strong\ninstability leading to a laminar-turbulent phase transition through a\nself-consistently defined order parameter. The results have been consistent\nacross a wide range of pump power values, heralding a breakthrough in the\nnon-invasive analysis of fiber laser dynamics.\n", "  Supernova remnants are believed to be the main sources of galactic Cosmic\nRays (CR). Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova\nremnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism\nthrough which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain\nopen issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs\nthemselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their\nsources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the\nevolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves\ngenerated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm\nneutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy\nthe largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are\ncharacterised by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction\nbetween those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping\nmechanism. It is found that streaming instability affects the propagation of\nCRs even in the presence of ion-neutral friction. The diffusion coefficient can\nbe suppressed by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ over a region of few tens of pc\naround the remnant. The suppression increases for smaller distances. The\npropagation of $\\approx 10$ GeV particles is affected for several tens of\nkiloyears after escape, while $\\approx 1$ TeV particles are affected for few\nkiloyears. This might have a great impact on the interpretation of gamma-ray\nobservations of molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants.\n", "  We demonstrate that dynamics of the ab-spiral-spin order in a magnetoelectric\nmultiferroic Eu0.55Y0.45MnO3 can be unambiguously probed through optical second\nharmonic signals, generated via the spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. In\nthe case of relatively weak photoexcitation,the ferroelectric and the\nspiral-spin order remains interlocked, both relaxing through spin-lattice\nrelaxation in the non-equilibrium state. When the additional optical pulse\nilluminating sample is intense enough to induced a local phase transition\nthermally, the system creates a metastable state of the bc-spiral-spin order\n(with the electric polarization P//c) via supercooling across the first-order\nphase transition between ab- and bc-spiral. The supercooled state of bc-spiral\nspin is formed in the thermodynamical ground state of ab-spiral (P//a),\ndisplaying a prolonged lifetime with strong dependence on the magnetic field\nalong the a-axis. The observed photo-switching between the two distinct\nmultiferroic states sheds light on novel photoinduced phenomena in spiral-spin\nmultiferroics.\n", "  We present an X-ray and radio study of the famous `El Gordo', a massive and\ndistant ($z=0.87$) galaxy cluster. In the deep (340 ks) Chandra observation,\nthe cluster appears with an elongated and cometary morphology, a sign of its\ncurrent merging state. The GMRT radio observations at 610 MHz reveal the\npresence of a radio halo which remarkably overlaps the X-ray cluster emission\nand connects a couple of radio relics. We detect a strong shock\n($\\mathcal{M}\\gtrsim3$) in the NW periphery of the cluster, co-spatially\nlocated with the radio relic. This is the most distant ($z=0.87$) and one of\nthe strongest shock detected in a galaxy cluster. This work supports the\nrelic-shock connection and allows to investigate the origin of these radio\nsources in a uncommon regime of $\\mathcal{M}\\gtrsim3$. For this particular case\nwe found that shock acceleration from the thermal pool is still a viable\npossibility.\n", "  Motivated by the observation of multiphoton electric dipole spin resonance\nprocesses in InAs nanowires, we theoretically study the transport dynamics of a\nperiodically driven five-level system, modeling the level structure of a\ntwo-electron double quantum dot. We show that the observed multiphoton\nresonances, which are dominant near interdot charge transitions, are due to\nmultilevel Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majorana interference. Here a third energy\nlevel serves as a shuttle that transfers population between the two resonant\nspin states. By numerically integrating the master equation we replicate the\nmain features observed in the experiments: multiphoton resonances (as large as\n8 photons), a robust odd-even dependence, and oscillations in the electric\ndipole spin resonance signal as a function of energy level detuning.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study capillary adhesion from a\nnanometer scale liquid bridge between two parallel flat solid surfaces. The\ncapillary force and the meniscus shape of the bridge are computed as the\nseparation between the solid surfaces is varied. Macroscopic theory predicts\nthe meniscus shape and the contribution of liquid/vapor interfacial tension to\nthe capillary force quite accurately for separations as small as 2 or 3\nmolecular diameters (1-2nm). However the total capillary force differs in sign\nand magnitude from macroscopic theory for separations less than about 5nm (8-10\ndiameters) because of molecular layering that is not included in macroscopic\ntheory. For these small separations, the pressure tensor in the fluid becomes\nanisotropic. The components in the plane of the surface vary smoothly and are\nconsistent with theory based on the macroscopic surface tension. Capillary\nadhesion is affected by only the perpendicular component, which has strong\noscillations as the molecular layering changes.\n", "  The two-dimensional graphene-like carbon allotrope, graphyne, has been\nrecently fabricated and exhibits many interesting electronic properties. In\nthis work, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of {\\gamma}-graphyne by\nperforming first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport\ntheory for both electron and phonon. The carrier relaxation time is accurately\nevaluated from the ultra-dense electron-phonon coupling matrix elements\ncalculated by adopting the density functional perturbation theory and Wannier\ninterpolation, rather than the generally used deformation potential theory\nwhich only considers the electron-acoustic phonon scattering. It is found that\nthe thermoelectric performance of {\\gamma}-graphyne exhibits a strong\ndependence on the temperature and carrier type. At an intermediate temperature\nof 600 K, a maximum ZT value of 1.5 and 1.0 can be achieved for the p- and\nn-type systems, respectively.\n", "  We discuss how x-ray Compton scattering spectra can be used for investigating\nthe evolution of electronic states in cathode materials of Li batteries under\nthe lithiation/delithiation process. In particular, our analysis of the Compton\nspectra taken from polycrystalline LixCoO2 samples shows that the spectra are\ndominated by the contribution of the O-2p redox orbital. We identify a distinct\nsignature of d-orbital delocalization, which is tied directly to the\nconductivity of the material, providing a descriptor based on Compton spectra\nfor monitoring the lithiation range with improved conductivity and kinetics for\nelectrochemical operation. Our study demonstrates that Compton scattering\nspectroscopy can provide a window for probing complex electronic mechanisms\nunderlying the charging and discharging processes in Li-battery materials.\n", "  Boltzmann introduced in the 1870's a logarithmic measure for the connection\nbetween the thermodynamical entropy and the probabilities of the microscopic\nconfigurations of the system. His entropic functional for classical systems was\nextended by Gibbs to the entire phase space of a many-body system, and by von\nNeumann in order to cover quantum systems as well. Finally, it was used by\nShannon within the theory of information. The simplest expression of this\nfunctional corresponds to a discrete set of $W$ microscopic possibilities, and\nis given by $S_{BG}= -k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i$ ($k$ is a positive universal\nconstant; {\\it BG} stands for {\\it Boltzmann-Gibbs}). This relation enables the\nconstruction of BG statistical mechanics. The BG theory has provided\nuncountable important applications. Its application in physical systems is\nlegitimate whenever the hypothesis of {\\it ergodicity} is satisfied. However,\n{\\it what can we do when ergodicity and similar simple hypotheses are\nviolated?}, which indeed happens in very many natural, artificial and social\ncomplex systems. It was advanced in 1988 the possibility of generalizing BG\nstatistical mechanics through a family of nonadditive entropies, namely\n$S_q=k\\frac{1-\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$, which recovers the additive $S_{BG}$\nentropy in the $q \\to1$ limit. The index $q$ is to be determined from\nmechanical first principles. Along three decades, this idea intensively evolved\nworld-wide (see Bibliography in \\url{http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm}),\nand led to a plethora of predictions, verifications, and applications in\nphysical systems and elsewhere. As expected whenever a {\\it paradigm shift} is\nexplored, some controversy naturally emerged as well in the community. The\npresent status of the general picture is here described, starting from its\ndynamical and thermodynamical foundations, and ending with its most recent\nphysical applications.\n", "  Ion-mediated interaction is important for the properties of polyelectrolytes\nsuch as colloids and nucleic acids. The effective pair interactions between two\npolyelectrolytes have been investigated extensively, but the many-body effect\nfor multiple polyelectrolytes still remains elusive. In this work, the\nmany-body effect in potential of mean force (PMF) between like-charged\nnanoparticles in various salt solutions has been comprehensively examined by\nMonte Carlo simulation and the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Our\ncalculations show that, at high 1:1 salt, the PMF is weakly repulsive and\nappears additive, while at low 1:1 salt, the additive assumption overestimates\nthe repulsive many-body PMF. At low 2:2 salt, the pair PMF appears weakly\nrepulsive while the many-body PMF can become attractive. In contrast, at high\n2:2 salt, the pair PMF is apparently attractive while the many-body effect can\ncause a weaker attractive PMF than that from the additive assumption. Our\nmicroscopic analyses suggest that the elusive many-body effect is attributed to\nion-binding which is sensitive to ion concentration, ion valence, number of\nnanoparticles and charges on nanoparticles.\n", "  We study the problem of calculating transport properties of interacting\nquantum systems, specifically electrical and thermal conductivities, by\ncomputing the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of the system biased by\ncontacts. Our approach is based on the structure of entanglement in the NESS.\nWith reasonable physical assumptions, we show that a NESS close to local\nequilibrium is lightly entangled and can be represented via a computationally\nefficient tensor network. We further argue that the NESS may be found by\ndynamically evolving the system within a manifold of appropriate low\nentanglement states. A physically realistic law of dynamical evolution is\nMarkovian open system dynamics, or the Lindblad equation. We explore this\napproach in a well-studied free fermion model where comparisons with the\nliterature are possible. We study both electrical and thermal currents with and\nwithout disorder, and compute entropic quantities such as mutual information\nand conditional mutual information. We conclude with a discussion of the\nprospects of this approach for the challenging problem of transport in strongly\ninteracting systems, especially those with disorder.\n", "  The individual characteristics of C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe on\nisochrones have been investigated in this study. Stellar models have been\nconstructed for various mixtures in which the content of each element is\nchanged up to the extreme value reported in recent studies, and the changes in\nisochrone shape have been analyzed for the various mixtures. To express the\nabundance variation of different elements with a single parameter, we have\nfocused on the relative changes in the total number of metal ions. A review of\nthe shape changes revealed that Na, Mg, and Al work the same way in stellar\nmodels, as the well-known fact that C, N, and O have the same reactions in the\nstellar interior. In addition, it was found that in high-metallicity conditions\nthe influence of Si and Fe on the red giant branch becomes smaller than that of\nNa, Mg, and Al closer to the tip. Furthermore, the influence of Fe on the main\nsequence is larger than that of Na, Mg, Al, and even Si.\n", "  We construct toric codes on various high-dimensional manifolds. Assuming a\nconjecture in geometry we find families of quantum CSS stabilizer codes on $N$\nqubits with logarithmic weight stabilizers and distance $N^{1-\\epsilon}$ for\nany $\\epsilon>0$. The conjecture is that there is a constant $C>0$ such that\nfor any $n$-dimensional torus ${\\mathbb T}^n={\\mathbb R}^n/\\Lambda$, where\n$\\Lambda$ is a lattice, the least volume unoriented $n/2$-dimensional surface\n(using the Euclidean metric) representing nontrivial homology has volume at\nleast $C^n$ times the volume of the least volume $n/2$-dimensional hyperplane\nrepresenting nontrivial homology; in fact, it would suffice to have this result\nfor $\\Lambda$ an integral lattice with the surface restricted to faces of a\ncubulation by unit hypercubes. The main technical result is an estimate of\nRankin invariants\\cite{rankin} for certain random lattices, showing that in a\ncertain sense they are optimal. Additionally, we construct codes with\nsquare-root distance, logarithmic weight stabilizers, and inverse\npolylogarithmic soundness factor (considered as quantum locally testable\ncodes\\cite{qltc}). We also provide an short, alternative proof that the\nshortest vector in the exterior power of a lattice may be\nnon-split\\cite{coulangeon}.\n", "  Chimera graphs define the topology of one of the first commercially available\nquantum computers. A variety of optimization problems have been mapped to this\ntopology to evaluate the behavior of quantum enhanced optimization heuristics\nin relation to other optimizers, being able to efficiently solve problems\nclassically to use them as benchmarks for quantum machines. In this paper we\ninvestigate for the first time the use of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) on\nIsing spin glass instances defined on the Chimera topology. Three genetic\nalgorithms (GAs) and three estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) are\nevaluated over $1000$ hard instances of the Ising spin glass constructed from\nSidon sets. We focus on determining whether the information about the topology\nof the graph can be used to improve the results of EAs and on identifying the\ncharacteristics of the Ising instances that influence the success rate of GAs\nand EDAs.\n", "  The excitonic finestructure of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) is comprised of\na manifold of transitions, of which only the lowest are populated and\ncontribute to photoluminescence. This leads to a Stokes shift in emission\nrelative to absorption. Here we show experimentally that the Stokes shift in Pb\nand Cd-based chalcogenide CQDs is correlated with the degree of surface\npassivation, and develop a model that explains how coupling to the surface\naffects the core electronic states. Dark and bright transitions can reorder and\nsplit, increasing the Stokes shift even without the formation of deep traps.\nOur findings resolve the highly-debated topic of excess Stokes shifts in PbS\nnanocrystals as due to parity-forbidden transitions instead of traps. We\npredict that the Stokes shift in PbS can be eliminated via core stoichiometry\ncontrol, a critical step towards enhancing the open circuit voltage in quantum\ndot solar cells.\n", "  The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) are twin 3U CubeSats. The\nfirst of the twin CubeSats (MinXSS-1) launched in December 2015 to the\nInternational Space Station for deployment in mid-2016. Both MinXSS CubeSats\nutilize a commercial off the shelf (COTS) X-ray spectrometer from Amptek to\nmeasure the solar irradiance from 0.5 to 30 keV with a nominal 0.15 keV FWHM\nspectral resolution at 5.9 keV, and a LASP-developed X-ray broadband photometer\nwith similar spectral sensitivity. MinXSS design and development has involved\nover 40 graduate students supervised by professors and professionals at the\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder. The majority of previous solar soft X-ray\nmeasurements have been either at high spectral resolution with a narrow\nbandpass or spectrally integrating (broadband) photometers. MinXSS will conduct\nunique soft X-ray measurements with moderate spectral resolution over a\nrelatively large energy range to study solar active region evolution, solar\nflares, and the effects of solar soft X-ray emission on Earth's ionosphere.\nThis paper focuses on the X-ray spectrometer instrument characterization\ntechniques involving radioactive X-ray sources and the National Institute for\nStandards and Technology (NIST) Synchrotron Ultraviolet Radiation Facility\n(SURF). Spectrometer spectral response, spectral resolution, response linearity\nare discussed as well as future solar science objectives.\n", "  In this work we develop some fifth-order integrable coupled systems of weight\n$0$ and $1$ which possess seventh-order symmetry. We establish four new\nsystems, where in some cases, related recursion operator and bi-Hamiltonian\nformulations are given. We also investigate the integrability of the developed\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper we find new self-adjoint commuting operators of rank 2 with\nrational coefficients and prove that any elliptic and hyperelliptic curves of\ngenus 2 are spectral curves of commuting operators with rational coefficients.\nAlso the case when curves of genus 3 are spectral curves of commuting operators\nwith rational coefficients is studied.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a technique for quantum random number generation\nbased on the random population of the output spatial modes of a beam splitter\nwhen both inputs are simultaneously fed with indistinguishable weak coherent\nstates. We simulate and experimentally validate the probability of generation\nof random bits as a function of the average photon number per input, and\ncompare it to the traditional approach of a single weak coherent state\ntransmitted through a beam-splitter, showing an improvement of up to 32\\%. The\nensuing interference phenomenon reduces the probability of coincident counts\nbetween the detectors associated with bits 0 and 1, thus increasing the\nprobability of occurrence of a valid output. A long bit string is assessed by a\nstandard randomness test suite with good confidence. Our proposal can be easily\nimplemented and opens attractive performance gains without a significant\ntrade-off.\n", "  Generation of free-space laser-like emissions of high spatiotemporal\ncoherence and narrow bandwidth in atmosphere opens promising opportunities for\nremote spectroscopic sensing. Here, we report on generation of such laser-like\nemissions, which results from the combined contributions of perturbative and\nnon-perturbative nonlinear optical effects in nitrogen molecules exposed to\nintense mid-infrared laser fields. We systematically investigate the dependence\nof the generated free-space laser spectrum on wavelength and power of the\ndriver laser. It is revealed that the free-space laser is produced by resonant\nRaman amplification of the fifth harmonic of the driver pulses in rotational\nwavepacket of the molecular nitrogen ions.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of field theories that arise from the low\nenergy limit of flux vacua built on type IIB string theory compactified on the\nmirror quintic. For a large collection of these models, we numerically\ndetermine the distribution of Taylor coefficients in a polynomial expansion of\neach model's scalar potential to fourth order, and show that they differ\nsignificantly from potentials generated by random choices of such coefficients\nover a flat measure.\n", "  We present an extensive set of photometry and radial velocities for the\ndetached eclipsing binary KV 29 in the intermediate-aged open cluster M11 (NGC\n6705). Spectroscopy shows that the system is double-lined and all available\nevidence (proper motion, photometry, and position on the CMD) indicates it is a\nmember of the cluster. We find the period of the binary to be\n$4.64276\\pm0.00001$ days. We find masses $3.604^{+0.002}_{-0.011}M_\\odot$ and\n$1.837^{+0.001}_{-0.006}M_\\odot$, and radii $5.392^{+0.018}_{-0.035}R_\\odot$\nand $1.656^{+0.007}_{-0.044}R_\\odot$ for the primary and secondary stars,\nrespectively. Because the primary star in the binary is rapidly evolving and is\nbrighter than the cluster turnoff in a color-magnitude diagram, the measurement\nof its radius leads to a strong constraint on the cluster age. We find the age\nof M11 to be $222^{+2}_{-3}\\pm15$ Myr, where the quoted uncertainties come from\nstatistical errors in the calculated masses and radii, and systematic\nuncertainties due to the ambiguity of the metallicity of the open cluster and\nvariations within the isochrone models concerning heavy elements and convective\novershooting.\n", "  Many asteroids are likely rubble-piles that are a collection of smaller\nobjects held together by gravity and possibly cohesion. These asteroids are\nseismically shaken by impacts, which leads to excitation of their constituent\nparticles. As a result it has been suggested that their surfaces and\nsub-surface interiors may be governed by a size sorting mechanism known as the\nBrazil Nut Effect. We study the behavior of a model asteroid that is a\nspherical, self-gravitating aggregate with a binary size-distribution of\nparticles under the action of applied seismic shaking. We find that above a\nseismic threshold, larger particles rise to the surface when friction is\npresent, in agreement with previous studies that focussed on cylindrical and\nrectangular box configurations. Unlike previous works we also find that size\nsorting takes place even with zero friction, though the presence of friction\ndoes aid the sorting process above the seismic threshold. Additionally we find\nthat while strong size sorting can take place near the surface, the innermost\nregions remain unsorted under even the most vigorous shaking.\n", "  By using local central Yukawa-type interactions that reproduce the low-energy\nparameters of the latest updates of the Nijmegen ESC08c potentials we show that\nthe $N\\Xi$, $NN\\Xi$, $N\\Xi\\Xi$ and $NN\\Xi\\Xi$ systems with maximal isospin are\nbound. Since in these states the strong decay $N\\Xi\\to\\Lambda\\Lambda$ is\nforbidden by isospin conservation, these strange few-body systems will be\nstable under the strong interaction. These results may suggest that other\nstates with different number of $N$'s and $\\Xi$'s in the maximal isospin\nchannel could also be bound.\n", "  Recent studies based on the integrated light of distant galaxies suggest that\nthe initial mass function (IMF) might not be universal. Variations of the IMF\nwith galaxy type and/or formation time may have important consequences for our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution. We have developed a new stellar population\nsynthesis (SPS) code specifically designed to reconstruct the IMF. We implement\na novel approach combining regularization with hierarchical Bayesian inference.\nWithin this approach we use a parametrized IMF prior to regulate a direct\ninference of the IMF. This direct inference gives more freedom to the IMF and\nallows the model to deviate from parametrized models when demanded by the data.\nWe use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to reconstruct the best\nparameters for the IMF prior, the age, and the metallicity of a single stellar\npopulation. We present our code and apply our model to a number of mock single\nstellar populations with different ages, metallicities, and IMFs. When\nsystematic uncertainties are not significant, we are able to reconstruct the\ninput parameters that were used to create the mock populations. Our results\nshow that if systematic uncertainties do play a role, this may introduce a bias\non the results. Therefore, it is important to objectively compare different\ningredients of SPS models. Through its Bayesian framework, our model is\nwell-suited for this.\n", "  Recently developed pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) theory successfully\nreproduces doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) with mean field\ncost. However, the projective nature of pCCD makes the method non-variational\nand thus hard to improve systematically. As a variational alternative, we\nexplore the idea of coupled-cluster-like expansions based on amplitude\ndeterminants and develop a specific theory similar to pCCD based on\ndeterminants of pairwise doubles. The new ansatz admits a variational treatment\nthrough Monte Carlo methods while remaining size-consistent and, crucially,\npolynomial cost. In the dissociations of LiH, HF, H2O and N2, the method\nperforms very similarly to pCCD and DOCI, suggesting that coupled-cluster-like\nansatzes and variational evaluation may not be mutually exclusive.\n", "  The physics of itinerant electrons in condensed matter is by and large\ngoverned by repulsive Coulomb forces. However, rare cases exist where local\nattractive interactions emerge and prevail in determining the ground state of\nthe system despite the dominant Coulomb repulsion. The most notable example is\nno doubt electron pairing, which leads to superconductivity and is mediated by\nelectron phonon coupling or more intricate mechanisms such as antiferromagnetic\nspin order in high-temperature superconductors. The interplay of attractive and\nrepulsive interaction components may also instigate spontaneous symmetry\nlowering and clustering of charges in geometric patterns such as bubbles and\nstripes, provided these interactions act on different length scales. In\nhigh-temperature superconductors, for instance, fluctuating stripe or nematic\nordering is intertwined with superconductivity itself. Both types of attractive\ninteraction based physics, pairing and charge ordering, are also at play in\nhigh-quality two-dimensional electron systems exposed to a quantizing\nperpendicular magnetic field for electrons describing larger orbits. This has\nbeen concluded indirectly from the transport behaviour when such phases form.\nAn unambiguous manifestation of an underlying attractive interaction between\nthe electrons has however remained elusive. Here we report the observation of a\nnegative permittivity as an immediate consequence of local attractive\ninteraction rather than repulsion among the electrons when bubble and stripe\nphases form. The implemented technique based on surface acoustic waves offers\ndirectionality and confirms the stripe phase to be a strongly anisotropic\nmedium.\n", "  The argument of Hodge duality symmetry is introduced starting from the\nelectromagnetic field. Introducing bosonic string theory, O(d,d) duality\nsymmetry can be implemented when there exist d-symmetries, which allows one to\nwrite Hodge-dual fields. A tree-level effective gravitational action of bosonic\nstring theory coupled with the dilaton field is considered. This theory\ninherits the Busher's duality of its parent string theory. The dilaton field\ncan be recast into the Weyl's mode of the metric tensor in the Jordan frame.\nThis maps the effective one-loop bosonic string theory of gravity into a\nLagrangian of a f(R) function. Constraining this f(R)-Lagrangian on a FLRW\nmetric and using Noether symmetries approach for extended theory of gravity, it\nis possible to show that the Lagrangian exibits a Gasperini-Veneziano duality\nsymmetry.\n", "  The random disorder can drastically change the melting scenario of\ntwo-dimensional systems and has to be taken into account in the interpretation\nof the experimental results. We present the results of the molecular dynamics\nsimulations of the two dimensional system with the core-softened potentials\nwith two repulsive steps in which a small fraction of the particles is pinned,\ninducing quenched disorder. It is shown that without the quenched disorder the\nsystem with small repulsive shoulder, which is close in the shape to the soft\ndisks, melts in accordance with the melting scenario proposed in Refs.\n[30,31,33] (first-order liquid-hexatic and continuous hexatic-solid\ntransitions). Random pinning widens the hexatic phase, but leaves the melting\nscenario unchanged. For the system with larger repulsive step at high densities\nthe conventional first-order transition takes place without random pinning.\nHowever, in the presence of disorder the single first-order transition\ntransforms into two transitions, one of them (solid-hexatic) is the continuous\nKTHNY-like transition, while the hexatic to isotropic liquid transition occurs\nas the first order transition.\n", "  Outer automorphisms of symmetries (\"symmetries of symmetries\") in\nrelativistic quantum field theories are studied, including charge conjugation\n(C), space-reflection (P) , and time-reversal (T) transformations. The group\ntheory of outer automorphisms is pedagogically introduced and it is shown that\nCP transformations are special outer automorphisms of the global, local, and\nspace-time symmetries of a theory. It is shown that certain discrete groups\nallow for a group theoretical prediction of parameter independent CP violating\ncomplex phases with fixed geometrical values. The remainder of this thesis\npioneers the study of outer automorphisms which are not related to C, P, or T.\nIt is shown how outer automorphisms, in general, relate symmetry invariants\nand, in theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking, imply relations between\ndifferent vacuum expectation values. Thereby, outer automorphisms can give rise\nto emergent symmetries. An example model with a discrete symmetry and three\ncopies of the Standard Model Higgs field is discussed, in which the rich outer\nautomorphism structure completely fixes the Higgs VEVs in their field space\ndirection, including CP violating relative phases. This underlies the\nphenomenon of spontaneous geometrical CP violation. The possible relevance of\nouter automorphisms for a wide field of future studies is highlighted.\n", "  The group focused on a model problem of idealised moist air convection in a\nsingle column of atmosphere. Height, temperature and moisture variables were\nchosen to simplify the mathematical representation (along the lines of the\nBoussinesq approximation in a height variable defined in terms of pressure).\nThis allowed exact simple solutions of the numerical and partial differential\nequation problems to be found. By examining these, we identify column\nbehaviour, stability issues and explore the feasibility of a more general\nsolution process.\n", "  In non-extreme Kerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, we prove that there is no\nnontrivial Dirac particle which is $L^p$ for $0<p\\leq\\frac{4}{3}$ with\narbitrary eigenvalue $\\lambda$, and for $\\frac{4}{3}<p\\leq\\frac{4}{3-2q}$,\n$0<q<\\frac{3}{2}$ with eigenvalue $|\\lambda|>|Q|+q \\kappa $, outside and away\nfrom the event horizon. By taking $q=\\frac{1}{2}$, we show that there is no\nnormalizable massive Dirac particle with mass greater than\n$|Q|+\\frac{\\kappa}{2} $ outside and away from the event horizon in non-extreme\nKerr-Newman-AdS spacetime, and they must either disappear into the black hole\nor escape to infinity, and this recovers the same result of Belgiorno and\nCacciatori in the case of $Q=0$ obtained by using spectral methods.\nFurthermore, we prove that any Dirac particle with eigenvalue\n$|\\lambda|<\\frac{\\kappa}{2} $ must be $L^2$ outside and away from the event\nhorizon.\n", "  This manuscript considers the main features of the nonlinear dynamics of\nmultiple irregular celestial body systems. The gravitational potential, static\nelectric potential, and magnetic potential are considered. Based on the three\nestablished potentials, we show that three conservative values exist for this\nsystem, including a Jacobi integral. The equilibrium conditions for the system\nare derived and their stability analyzed. The equilibrium conditions of a\ncelestial system comprised of n irregular bodies are reduced to 12n minus 9\nequations. The dynamical results are applied to simulate the motion of\nmultiple-asteroid systems. The simulation is useful for the study of the\nstability of multiple irregular celestial body systems and for the design of\nspacecraft orbits to triple asteroid systems discovered in the solar system.\nThe dynamical configurations of the five triple-asteroid systems 45 Eugenia, 87\nSylvia, 93 Minerva, 216 Kleopatra, and 136617 1994CC, and the six-body system\n134340 Pluto are calculated and analyzed.\n", "  Purpose: When comparing different scans of the same radiochromic film,\nseveral patterns can be observed. These patterns are caused by different\nsources of uncertainty, which affect the repeatability of the scanner. The\npurpose of this work was to study these uncertainties.\n  Methods: The variance of the scanner noise, as a function of the pixel\nposition, was studied for different resolutions. The inter-scan variability of\nthe scanner response was analyzed taking into account spatial discrepancies.\nFinally, the distance between the position of the same point in different scans\nwas examined.\n  Results: The variance of noise follows periodical patterns in both axes,\ncausing the grid patterns. These patterns were identified for resolutions of\n50, 72 and 96 dpi, but not for 150 dpi. Specially recognizable is the\nsinusoidal shape with a period of 8.5 mm that is produced with 72 dpi.\nInter-scan variations of the response caused systematic relative dose\ndeviations larger than 1% in 5% of the red channel images, 9% of the green and\n51% of the blue. No systematic deviation larger than 1% was found after\napplying response corrections. The initial positioning and the speed of the\nscanner lamp vary between scans.\n  Conclusions: Three new sources of uncertainty, which influence radiochromic\nfilm dosimetry with flatbed scanners, have been identified and analyzed in this\nwork: grid patterns, spatial inter-scan variations and scanning reading\nrepeatability. A novel correction method is proposed, which mitigates spatial\ninter-scan variations caused by deviations in the autocalibration of the\nindividual Charge Coupled Device detectors.\n", "  Sidharth had shown that gravitation can be reconciled with electromagnetic\nand other forces if we start from a Landau-Ginzburg phase transition. This is\nfurther remarked upon and a unification of all forces of nature is proposed.\n", "  Sunspot number series are subject to various uncertainties, which are still\npoorly known. The need for their better understanding was recently highlighted\nby the major makeover of the international Sunspot Number [Clette et al., Space\nScience Reviews, 2014]. We present the first thorough estimation of these\nuncertainties, which behave as Poisson-like random variables with a\nmultiplicative coefficient that is time- and observatory-dependent. We provide\na simple expression for these uncertainties, and reveal how their evolution in\ntime coincides with changes in the observations, and processing of the data.\nKnowing their value is essential for properly building composites out of\nmultiple observations, and for preserving the stability of the composites in\ntime.\n", "  Stars form in dense, dusty structures, which are embedded in larger clumps of\nmolecular clouds often showing a clear filamentary structure on large scales (>\n1pc). One of the best-studied regions in the Hi-GAL survey can be observed\ntoward the l=224deg field. Here, a filamentary region has been studied and it\nhas been found that protostellar clumps are mostly located along the main\nfilament, whereas starless clumps are detected off this filament and are\ninstead found on secondary, less prominent filaments. We want to investigate\nthis segregation effect and how it may affect the clumps properties. We mapped\nthe 12CO(1-0) line and its main three isotopologues toward the two most\nprominent filaments observed toward the l=224deg field using the Mopra radio\ntelescope, in order to set observational constraints on the dynamics of these\nstructures and the associated starless and protostellar clumps. Compared to the\nstarless clumps, the protostellar clumps are more luminous, more turbulent and\nlie in regions where the filamentary ambient gas shows larger linewidths. We\nsee evidence of gas flowing along the main filament, but we do not find any\nsigns of accretion flow from the filament onto the Hi-GAL clumps. We analyze\nthe radial column density profile of the filaments and their gravitational\nstability. The more massive and highly fragmented main filament appears to be\nthermally supercritical and gravitationally bound, assuming that all of the\nnon-thermal motion is contributing thermal-like support, suggesting a later\nstage of evolution compared to the secondary filament. The status and\nevolutionary phase of the Hi-GAL clumps would then appear to correlate with\nthat of the host filament.\n", "  The Static User Equilibrium is a powerful framework for the theoretical study\nof traffic. Despite the restricting assumption of stationary flows that\nintuitively limit its application to real traffic systems, many operational\nmodels implementing it are still used without an empirical validation of the\nexistence of the equilibrium. We investigate its existence on a traffic dataset\nof three months for the region of Paris, FR. The implementation of an\napplication for interactive spatio-temporal data exploration allows to\nhypothesize a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and to guide further\nquantitative work. The assumption of locally stationary flows is invalidated in\na first approximation by empirical results, as shown by a strong spatial and\ntemporal variability in shortest paths and in network topological measures such\nas betweenness centrality. Furthermore, the behavior of spatial autocorrelation\nindex of congestion patterns at different spatial ranges suggest a chaotic\nevolution at the local scale, especially during peak hours. We finally discuss\nthe implications of these empirical findings and describe further possible\ndevelopments based on the estimation of Lyapunov dynamical stability of traffic\nflows.\n", "  We revise and extend the algorithm provided in [1] to compute the finite\nConnes' distance between normal states. The original formula in [1] contains an\nerror and actually only provides a lower bound. The correct expression, which\nwe provide here, involves the computation of the infimum of an expression which\ninvolves the \"transverse\" component of the algebra element in addition to the\n\"longitudinal\" component of [1]. This renders the formula less user-friendly,\nas the determination of the exact transverse component for which the infimum is\nreached remains a non-trivial task, but under rather generic conditions it\nturns out that the Connes' distance is proportional to the trace norm of the\ndifference in the density matrices, leading to considerable simplification. In\naddition, we can determine an upper bound of the distance by emulating and\nadapting the approach of [2] in our Hilbert-Schmidt operatorial formulation. We\nthen look for an optimal element for which the upper bound is reached. We are\nable to find one for the Moyal plane through the limit of a sequence obtained\nby finite dimensional projections of the representative of an element belonging\nto a multiplier algebra, onto the subspaces of the total Hilbert space,\noccurring in the spectral triple and spanned by the eigen-spinors of the\nrespective Dirac operator. This is in contrast with the fuzzy sphere, where the\nupper bound, which is given by the geodesic of a commutative sphere is never\nreached for any finite $n$-representation of $SU(2)$. Indeed, for the case of\nmaximal non-commutativity ($n = 1/2$), the finite distance is shown to coincide\nexactly with the above mentioned lower bound, with the transverse component\nplaying no role. This, however starts changing from $n=1$ onwards and we try to\nimprove the estimate of the finite distance and provide an almost exact result,\nusing our new and modified algorithm.\n", "  Epitaxial heterostructures composed of complex oxides have fascinated\nresearchers for over a decade as they offer multiple degrees of freedom to\nunveil emergent many-body phenomena often unattainable in bulk. Recently, apart\nfrom stabilizing such artificial structures along the conventional\n[001]-direction, tuning the growth direction along unconventional\ncrystallographic axes has been highlighted as a promising route to realize\nnovel quantum many-body phases. Here we illustrate this rapidly developing\nfield of geometrical lattice engineering with the emphasis on a few\nprototypical examples of the recent experimental efforts to design complex\noxide heterostructures along the (111) orientation for quantum phase discovery\nand potential applications.\n", "  A short summary of a NLO QCD calculation for the top-quark pair production\nwith a jet in the dilepton decay channel is presented. The calculation takes\ninto account all double, single, non-resonant and interference contributions.\nThus, NLO QCD corrections are computed for the process pp -> e+ ve mu- vm~ b b~\nj + X. This calculation provides the first complete description, which\novercomes the narrow width approximation for ttj process in the dilepton decay\nchannel. Results for the total cross section and differential distributions for\nthe LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV are shown.\n", "  A statistical-type model is developed to describe the ion production and\nelectron emission in collisions of (molecular) ions with atoms. The model is\nbased on the Boltzmann population of the bound electronic energy levels of the\nquasi molecule formed in the collision and the discretized continuum. The\ndiscretization of the continuum is implemented by a free electron gas in a box\nmodel assuming an effective square potential of the quasi molecule. The\ntemperature of the electron gas is calculated by taking into account a\nthermodynamically adiabatic process due to the change of the effective volume\nof the quasi molecule as the system evolves. The system may undergo a\ntransition with a small probability from the discretized continuum to the\nstates of the complementary continuum. It is assumed that these states are\ndecoupled from the thermodynamic time development. The decoupled states\noverwhelmingly determine the yield of the asymptotically observed fragment\nions. The main motivation of this work is to describe the recently observed\n$H^-$ ion production in $OH^+ + Ar$ collisions. The obtained differential cross\nsections for $H^-$ formation, cation production and electron emission are close\nto the experimental ones. Calculations for the atomic systems $O^+ + Ar$ and\n$H^+ + Ar$ are also in reasonable agreement with the experiments indicating\nthat the model can be applied to a wide class of collisions.\n", "  The physical origin of dielectric loss is shown to be sum of n number of\nsubunits relaxation of a molecule, where n=1,2,3.. For each subunit relaxation,\nthe idea of intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions triggered non-Debye\ndipole, ($\\bf G$)$_{n}$=((1-g$_d$)$\\bf G$$_{0}$)$_{n}$, and the ensuing dual\ndipole ($\\bf G$$_{\\pm}$)$_n$=($\\bf G$$_0$$\\pm$$\\bf G$)$_n$, relaxation\nprocesses is proposed, where $\\bf G$$_{-}$=g$_{d}$$\\bf G$$_{0}$, $\\bf\nG$$_{+}$=(2-g$_{d}$)$\\bf G$$_{0}$, and $\\bf G$$_{0}$ is a Debye dipole. Each\nsubunit motion is statistically highly independent process and discriminated by\nDebye and non-Debye relaxation (NDR) time, where g$_d$ is an exponent 0<g$_d$<1\nand signifies interaction strength with a redistribution and conservation of\nDebye dielectric loss energy. The proposed concept provides a new insight for\nthe NDR and discloses the physical origin of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$,\n$\\delta$ relaxations and excess wing of glass formers, plastic crystals, drugs,\netc., with an excellent agreement with experimental results.\n", "  We provide a new analysis of the irreducible loop integrals first considered\nin a 2003 paper of Wu. Using convergence ideas from probability, we produce\nconditions on the regulator masses so that the integrals have well-defined\nlimits in the limit required by the regularisation technique; we then derive\nclosed-form expressions for the regularised forms of these integrals in terms\nof incomplete Gamma-functions.\n", "  The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) is\nthe only mid-IR Integral Field Spectrometer on board James Webb Space\nTelescope. The complexity of the MRS requires a very specialized pipeline, with\nsome specific steps not present in other pipelines of JWST instruments, such as\nfringe corrections and wavelength offsets, with different algorithms for point\nsource or extended source data. The MRS pipeline has also two different\nvariants: the baseline pipeline, optimized for most foreseen science cases, and\nthe optimal pipeline, where extra steps will be needed for specific science\ncases. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the MRS Calibration\nPipeline from uncalibrated slope images to final scientific products, with\nbrief descriptions of its algorithms, input and output data, and the accessory\ndata and calibration data products necessary to run the pipeline.\n", "  The ideal laser source for the emerging research field of nonlinear Terahertz\n(THz) spectroscopy should offer radiation with a large versatility and deliver\nboth ultra-intense multi-octave spanning single-cycle pulses and\nuser-selectable multi-cycle pulses at narrow linewidth. The absence of such a\ntable-top source has hampered advances in numerous THz disciplines including\nimaging, nonlinear photonics and spectroscopy, selective out-of-equilibrium\nexcitation of condensed matter and quantum systems. Here we introduce a highly\nversatile table-top THz laser platform providing single-cycle GV/m transients\nas well as spectrally narrow pulses tunable in bandwidth and central frequency\nacross 5 octaves with hundreds of MV/m field strength. The compact scheme is\nbased on optical rectification of a temporally modulated laser beam in organic\ncrystals. It allows for the selection of THz oscillation cycles from 1 to >50\nand central frequency tuning range from 0.5 to 7 THz by directly changing the\nmodulation period of the driving laser. The versatility of the THz source is\ndemonstrated by providing a broadband 5-octave spanning spectrum as well as a\nspectrally narrow line tunable across the full optical rectification\nphase-matching band with a minimum width of dv=30 GHz, corresponding to dE=0.13\nmeV and lambda^-1=1.1 cm-1. The presented table-top source shows performances\nsimilar or even beyond to that of a large-scale THz electron accelerator\nfacility but offering in addition versatile multi-color and advanced\nfemtosecond pump-probe opportunities at ultralow timing jitter.\n", "  A critique of a prescription of non-locality in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 4418\n(2000)], [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 040404 (2002)], [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 130404\n(2004)] that appears to be stronger and more general than the Bell-CHSH\nformulation is presented. It is shown that, contrary to expectations, this\nprescription fails to correctly identify a large family of maximally non-local\nBell states.\n", "  We report on transport properties of the topological insulator single crystal\n$Sb2Te3$ nanoflakes with thickness about from 7 to 50nm. A steep drop of\nresistance is appeared near $3K$ in the ultrathin $Sb2Te3$ nanoflakes,\nmanifesting a superconducting transition.The magnetic field induced\nsuperconductor insulator transition of disordered 2D superconductor system is\nobserved in the nanoflakes.The results show that the existence of certain\noptimum degree of disorder is a necessary condition for emergence of\nsuperconductivity.Temperature dependence of magneto-resistance shows a\nconsecutive transformation of weak antilocalization cusp into the\nsuperconducting transition at low field when $B < BC$.\n", "  It is considered a model of compact Riemann surface in genus two, represented\ngeometrically by two-parametric hyperbolic octagon with an order four\nautomorphism and described algebraically by the corresponding Fuchsian group.\nIntroducing the Fenchel--Nielsen variables, we compute the Weil--Petersson (WP)\nsymplectic two-form for parameter space and analyze the closed isoperimetric\norbits of octagons. WP-Area in parameter space and the canonical action--angle\nvariables for the orbits are found. Exploiting the ideas from the loop quantum\ngravity, we generate relativistic kinematics by the Lorentz boost and quantize\nWP-area. We treat the evolution in terms of global variables within the \"big\nbounce\" concept.\n", "  A theory of an acoustic vector soliton of the Love wave is constructed. The\nnonlinear Love wave propagating along the interface between of a plane surface\nlayer and the elastic semi-space under the condition of acoustic self-induced\ntransparency is investigated. A thin resonance transition layer containing\nparamagnetic impurity atoms or semiconductor quantum dots sandwiched between\nthese two connected media. Explicit analytical expressions for the profile and\nparameters of the Love vector soliton are obtained. It is shown that the\nproperties of the nonlinear Love wave depends on the parameters of the\ntransition resonance layer, the connected elastic media and the transverse\nstructure of the Love mode. Numerical investigations of the Love vector soliton\nis executed for the parameters of the layered structure ZnO/LiNbO_{3} and\nsurface acoustic waves which can be reached in current experiments.\n", "  Ion-conducting memristors comprised of the layered chalcogenide materials\nGe2Se3/SnSe/Ag are described. The memristor, termed a self-directed channel\n(SDC) device, can be classified as a generic memristor and can tolerate\ncontinuous high temperature operation (at least 150 {\\deg}C). Unlike other\nchalcogenide-based ion conducting device types, the SDC does not require\ncomplicated fabrication steps, such as photodoping or thermal annealing, making\nthese devices faster and more reliable to fabricate. Device pulsed response\nshows fast state switching in the 10E-9 s range. Device cycling at both room\ntemperature and 140 {\\deg}C show cycling lifetimes of at least 1 billion.\n", "  Using integration by parts relations, Feynman integrals can be represented in\nterms of coupled systems of differential equations. In the following we suppose\nthat the unknown Feynman integrals can be given in power series\nrepresentations, and that sufficiently many initial values of the integrals are\ngiven. Then there exist algorithms that decide constructively if the\ncoefficients of their power series representations can be given within the\nclass of nested sums over hypergeometric products. In this article we will work\nout the calculation steps that solve this problem. First, we will present a\nsuccessful tactic that has been applied recently to challenging problems coming\nfrom massive 3-loop Feynman integrals. Here our main tool is to solve scalar\nlinear recurrences within the class of nested sums over hypergeometric\nproducts. Second, we will present a new variation of this tactic which relies\non more involved summation technologies but succeeds in reducing the problem to\nsolve scalar recurrences with lower recurrence orders. The article will work\nout the different challenges of this new tactic and demonstrates how they can\nbe treated efficiently with our existing summation technologies.\n", "  This new study develops an algorithm for Short Wave upwelling Radiative Flux\n(SWupRF) for the spectral variations within near infrared (NIR) from 1100 to\n1700 nm wavelength band based on remote sensing data set of Argus 1000\nmicro-spectrometer observations. We calculate the SWupRF by investigating the\ntotal radiative flux due to O2, H2O, CO2 and CH4 and also by the individual gas\nwithin the selected wavelength bands of interest. A GENSPECT synthetic line by\nline radiative transfer model is applied to perform radiative transfer\nsimulations to calculate the radiative flux by varying surface albedo, mixing\nratios of the selected greenhouse gases, surface temperature, solar sun and\nzenith angles with different latitude and longitude of the instrument. Finally,\nthe SWupRFsyn estimated from GENSPECT was compared with SWupRFobs from Argus\n1000 over a period of four years (2009 and 2013) covering all seasons. We\ncalculate and compare both the synthetic and real measured observed data set.\nThe synthetic model gives SWupRFsyn within the range of [0.3950 to 1.650] W/m2\nand the selected Argus observed model gives SWupRFobs within the range of [0.10\nto 3.15] W/m2. The simulated range of synthetic model also represents 1 to 32 K\nrise of temperature within the different concentration of water vapor and other\ngases. The authors determined that the satellite observed data of week 75 pass\n43 & week 08 pass 61 showing minimum 0.850 [0.10 to 1.60] W/m2 and maximum 1.65\n[0.12 to 3.15] W/m2 respectively.\n", "  Using the tight-binding (TB) approximation with inclusion of the spin-orbit\ninteraction, we predict a topological phase transition in the electronic band\nstructure of phosphorene in the presence of axial strains. We derive a\nlow-energy TB Hamiltonian that includes the spin-orbit interaction for bulk\nphosphorene. Applying a compressive biaxial in-plane strain and perpendicular\ntensile strain in ranges where the structure is still stable leads to a\ntopological phase transition. We also examine the influence of strain on zigzag\nphosphorene nanoribbons (zPNRs) and the formation of the corresponding\nprotected edge states when the system is in the topological phase. For zPNRs up\nto a width of 100 nm the energy gap is at least three orders of magnitude\nlarger than the thermal energy at room temperature.\n", "  The present Letter proposes a device based on graphene for infrared light\nemission. It is based on a n- and p-doped monolayer graphene (MGs), with Fermi\nenergies $E_F$ and -$E_F$, respectively, sandwiching a bilayer graphene (BG)\nwith bandgap $\\Lambda=2|eV_g-\\Delta|\\geq 2E_F$, where $V_g$ is the gate voltage\nacross the BG and $\\Delta$ the sub-lattice energy difference into each layer of\nthe BG. This device works as simple as tuning the gate voltage to decrease the\nBG bandgap down to $2E_F$; and, once this condition is fulfilled, a current\nflows from the n-doped MG to the p-doped MG. However, when electrons achieve\nthe other side of the device, i.e., into the p-doped MG, their energies ($E_F$)\nare much bigger than the holes energies ($-E_F$), and thus these electrons\ndecay emitting infrared photons.\n", "  This work reports the discovery of cycle-to-cycle modulated spectral line and\natmospheric velocity gradient variability in long-period Cepheids based on 925\nhigh-resolution optical spectra of $\\ell$ Carinae (P $\\sim$ 35.5 d) recorded\nduring three heavy duty-cycle monitoring campaigns (in 2014, 2015, and 2016).\nSpectral line variability is investigated via cross-correlation functions\n(CCFs) computed using three sets of spectral lines (weak, solar, strong). A\nmetallic line velocity gradient, {\\delta}v$_r$ (t), is computed as the\ndifference between weak and strong-line RVs. CCF shape indicators BIS\n(asymmetry), FWHM, and depth all exhibit clear phase-dependent variability\npatterns that differ from one pulsation cycle to the next. Weak-line CCFs\nexhibit these effects more clearly than strong-line CCFs. BIS exhibits the most\npeculiar modulated variability and can be used to identify the presence of\ncycle-to-cycle modulated line profile variations. {\\delta}v$_r$ (t) clearly\nexhibits cycle-to-cycle differences that correlate very closely with modulated\nBIS variability, suggesting perturbations of the atmospheric velocity field as\nthe cause for modulated spectral line variability. These perturbations are most\nsignificant during contraction and are not in phase with the pulsation,\ntransmitting information between consecutive pulsation cycles. This work shows\nRV curve modulation to be a consequence of atmospheric velocity gradient\nperturbations. Possible origins of these perturbations and their impact on\nCepheid RV measurements as well as the projection factor used in\nBaade-Wesselink-type distance determinations are discussed.\n", "  The problem of distributing the workload on a parallel computer to minimize\nthe overall runtime is known as Multiprocessor Scheduling Problem. It is\nNP-hard, but like many other NP-hard problems, the average hardness of random\ninstances displays an ``easy-hard'' phase transition. The transition in\nMultiprocessor Scheduling can be analyzed using elementary notions from\ncrystallography (Bravais lattices) and statistical mechanics (Potts vectors).\nThe analysis reveals the control parameter of the transition and its critical\nvalue including finite size corrections. The transition is identified in the\nperformance of practical scheduling algorithms.\n", "  Number partitioning is a classical problem from combinatorial optimisation.\nIn physical terms it corresponds to a long range anti-ferromagnetic Ising spin\nglass. It has been rigorously proven that the low lying energies of number\npartitioning behave like uncorrelated random variables. We claim that\nneighbouring energy levels are uncorrelated almost everywhere on the energy\naxis, and that energetically adjacent configurations are uncorrelated, too.\nApparently there is no relation between geometry (configuration) and energy\nthat could be exploited by an optimization algorithm. This ``local random\nenergy'' picture of number partitioning is corroborated by numerical\nsimulations and heuristic arguments.\n", "  A new uncertainty relation (UR) is obtained for a system of N identical pure\nentangled particles if we use symmetrized observables when deriving the\ninequality. This new expression can be written in a form where we identify a\nterm which explicitly shows the quantum correlations among the particles that\nconstitute the system. For the particular cases of two and three particles,\nmaking use of the Schwarz inequality, we obtain new lower bounds for the UR\nthat are different from the standard one.\n"]}
