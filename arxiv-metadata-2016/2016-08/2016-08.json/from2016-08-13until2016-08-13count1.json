The dependence of the Coulomb\nsums on the momentum transfers of 6^Li and 7^Li is shown to differ\nsubstantially from similar dependences for all the other nuclei investigated.\nRelationship between the nuclear cluster structure and Coulomb sums has been\nconsidered. The momentum transfer value, above which the Coulomb sum becomes\nconstant, is found to be related to the cluster isolation parameter x, which\ncharacterizes the degree of nuclear clusterization.\n"]}
