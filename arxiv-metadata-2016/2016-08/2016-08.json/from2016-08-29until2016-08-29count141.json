Using these formulas we consider subalgebras of Lie algebras of\npseudounitary groups. Our main techniques are Clifford algebras. We have find\n12 types of subalgebras of Lie algebras of pseudounitary groups.\n", "  In the currently accepted models of the nonlinear optics, the nonlinear\nradiation was treated as the result of an infinitesimally thin polarization\nsheet layer, and a three layer model was generally employed. The direct\nconsequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant, which\nstill does not have a clear definition, has to be assigned to this polarization\nlayer. Because the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and the Sum-Frequency\nGeneration vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS) have been proven as the sensitive\nprobes for interfaces with the submonolayer coverage, the treatment based on\nthe more realistic discrete induced dipole model needs to be developed. Here we\nshow that following the molecular optics theory approach the SHG, as well as\nthe SFG-VS, radiation from the monolayer or submonolayer at an interface can be\nrigorously treated as the radiation from an induced dipole lattice at the\ninterface. In this approach, the introduction of the polarization sheet is no\nlonger necessary. Therefore, the ambiguity of the unaccounted dielectric\nconstant of the polarization layer is no longer an issue. Moreover, the\nanisotropic two dimensional microscopic local field factors can be explicitly\nexpressed with the linear polarizability tensors of the interfacial molecules.\nBased on the planewise dipole sum rule in the molecular monolayer, crucial\nexperimental tests of this microscopic treatment with SHG and SFG-VS are\ndiscussed. Many puzzles in the literature of surface SHG and SFG spectroscopy\nstudies can also be understood or resolved in this framework. This new\ntreatment may provide a solid basis for the quantitative analysis in the\nsurface SHG and SFG studies.\n", "  In this short review, we outline three sets of developments in understanding\nheterotic string compactifications. First, we outline recent progress in\nheterotic analogues of quantum cohomology computations. Second, we discuss a\npotential swampland issue in heterotic strings, and new heterotic string\nconstructions that can be used to fill in the naively missing theories. Third,\nwe discuss recent developments in string compactifications on stacks and their\napplications, concluding with an outline of work-in-progress on heterotic\nstring compactifications on gerbes.\n", "  A fundamental physical principle that has consequences for the topology of\nspace-time is the principle of Einstein-Weyl causality. We show here that this\nmay have implications on quantum mechanics, as well. Borchers and Sen have\nrigorously investigated the mathematical implications of Einstein-Weyl\ncausality and shown the denumerable space-time Q^2 would be implied. They then\nimbedded this space in a non-denumerable space but were left with important\nphilosophical paradoxes regarding the nature of the physical real line E, e.g.,\nwhether E = R, the real line of mathematics. Alternatively, their initial\nresult could suggest a constructible foundation. We have pursued such a program\nand find it indeed provides a dense, denumerable space-time and, moreover, an\ninteresting connection with quantum mechanics.\n", "  Here we report the polarization dependent non-resonant second harmonic\ngeneration (SHG) measurement of the interfacial water molecules at the aqueous\nsolution of the following salts: NaF, NaCl, NaBr, KF, KCl, and KBr. Through\nquantitative polarization analysis of the SHG data,the orientational parameter\nD value and the relative surface density of the interfacial water molecules at\nthese aqueous solution surfaces were determined. From these results we found\nthat addition of each of the six salts caused increase of the thickness of the\ninterfacial water layer at the surfaces to a certain extent. Noticeably, both\nthe cations and the anions contributed to the changes, and the abilities to\nincrease the thickness of the interfacial water layer were in the following\norder: KBr > NaBr > KCl > NaCl ~ NaF > KF. Since these changes can not be\nfactorized into individual anion and cation contributions, there are possible\nion pairing or association effects, especially for the NaF case. We also found\nthat the orientational parameter D values of the interfacial water molecules\nchanged to opposite directions for the aqueous solutions of the three sodium\nsalts versus the aqueous solutions of the three potassium salts. These findings\nclearly indicated unexpected specific Na+ and K+ cation effects at the aqueous\nsolution surface. These effects were not anticipated from the recent molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulation results, which concluded that the Na+ and K+ cations\ncan be treated as small non-polarizable hard ions and they are repelled from\nthe aqueous interfaces. These results suggest that the electrolyte aqueous\nsolution surfaces are more complex than the currently prevalent theoretical and\nexperimental understandings.\n", "  Sum frequency generation vibrational spectra of the water molecules at the\nNaF and KF aqueous solution surfaces showed significantly different spectral\nfeatures and different concentration dependence. This result is the first\ndirect observation of the cation effects of the simple alkali cations, which\nhave been believed to be depleted from the aqueous surface, on the hydrogen\nbonding structure of the water molecules at the electrolyte solution surfaces.\nThese observations may provide important clue to understand the fundamental\nphenomenon of ions at the air/water interface.\n", "  In our paper we consider the notion of determinant of Clifford algebra\nelements. We present some new formulas for determinant of Clifford algebra\nelements for the cases of dimension 4 and 5. Also we consider the notion of\ntrace of Clifford algebra elements. We use the generalization of the Pauli's\ntheorem for 2 sets of elements that satisfy the main anticommutation conditions\nof Clifford algebra.\n", "  Hadamard states are generally considered as the physical states for linear\nquantized fields on curved spacetimes, for several good reasons. Here, we\nprovide a new motivation for the Hadamard condition: for \"ultrastatic slab\nspacetimes\" with compact Cauchy surface, we show that the Wick squares of all\ntime derivatives of the quantized Klein-Gordon field have finite fluctuations\nonly if the Wick-ordering is defined with respect to a Hadamard state. This\nprovides a converse to an important result of Brunetti and Fredenhagen. The\nrecently proposed \"S-J (Sorkin-Johnston) states\" are shown, generically, to\ngive infinite fluctuations for the Wick square of the time derivative of the\nfield, further limiting their utility as reasonable states. Motivated by the\nS-J construction, we also study the general question of extending states that\nare pure (or given by density matrices relative to a pure state) on a\ndouble-cone region of Minkowski space. We prove a result for general quantum\nfield theories showing that such states cannot be extended to any larger\ndouble-cone without encountering singular behaviour at the spacelike boundary\nof the inner region. In the context of the Klein-Gordon field this shows that\neven if an S-J state is Hadamard within the double cone, this must fail at the\nboundary.\n", "  The integration of complex oxides on silicon presents opportunities to extend\nand enhance silicon technology with novel electronic, magnetic, and photonic\nproperties. Among these materials, barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a particularly\nstrong ferroelectric perovskite oxide with attractive dielectric and\nelectro-optic properties. Here we demonstrate nanophotonic circuits\nincorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 thin films on the ubiquitous\nsilicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. We grow epitaxial, single-crystalline\nBaTiO3 directly on SOI and engineer integrated waveguide structures that\nsimultaneously confine light and an RF electric field in the BaTiO3 layer.\nUsing on-chip photonic interferometers, we extract a large effective Pockels\ncoefficient of 213 plus minus 49 pm/V, a value more than six times larger than\nfound in commercial optical modulators based on lithium niobate. The\nmonolithically integrated BaTiO3 optical modulators show modulation bandwidth\nin the gigahertz regime, which is promising for broadband applications.\n", "  The talks given in parallel session D4 at the 20th International Conference\non General Relativity and Gravitation (Warsaw 2013) are summarized.\n", "  We consider the non-interacting source-free Maxwell field, described both in\nterms of the vector potential and the field strength. Starting from the\nclassical field theory on contractible globally hyperbolic spacetimes, we\nextend the classical field theory to general globally hyperbolic spacetimes in\ntwo ways to obtain a \"universal\" theory and a \"reduced\" theory. The quantum\nfield theory in terms of the unital $*$-algebra of the smeared quantum field is\nthen obtained by an application of a suitable quantisation functor. We show\nthat the universal theories fail local covariance and dynamical locality owing\nto the possibility of having non-trivial radicals in the classical and\nnon-trivial centres in the quantum case. The reduced theories are both locally\ncovariant and dynamically local. These models provide new examples relevant to\nthe discussion of how theories should be formulated so as to describe the same\nphysics in all spacetimes.\n", "  We introduce a Banach Lie group $G$ of unitary operators subject to a natural\ntrace condition. We compute the homotopy groups of $G$, describe its cohomology\nand construct an $S^1$-central extension. We show that the central extension\ndetermines a non-trivial gerbe on the action Lie groupoid $G\\ltimes\n\\mathfrak{k}$, where $\\mathfrak{k}$ denotes the Hilbert space of self-adjoint\nHilbert-Schmidt operators. With an eye towards constructing elements in twisted\nK-theory, we prove the existence of a cubic Dirac operator $\\mathbb{D}$ in a\nsuitable completion of the quantum Weil algebra $\\mathcal{U}(\\mathfrak{g})\n\\otimes Cl(\\mathfrak{k})$, which is subsequently extended to a projective\nfamily of self-adjoint operators $\\mathbb{D}_A$ on $G\\ltimes \\frak{k}$. While\nthe kernel of $\\mathbb{D}_A$ is infinite-dimensional, we show that there is\nstill a notion of finite reducibility at every point, which suggests a\ngeneralized definition of twisted K-theory for action Lie groupoids.\n", "  We use MERLIN, VLA and VLBA observations of Galactic \\HI absorption towards\n3C~138 to estimate the structure function of the \\HI opacity fluctuations at AU\nscales. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that there is likely to be a\nsignificant bias in the estimated structure function at signal-to-noise ratios\ncharacteristic of our observations, if the structure function is constructed in\nthe manner most commonly used in the literature. We develop a new estimator\nthat is free from this bias and use it to estimate the true underlying\nstructure function slope on length scales ranging $5$ to $40$~AU. From a power\nlaw fit to the structure function, we derive a slope of $0.81^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$,\ni.e. similar to the value observed at parsec scales. The estimated upper limit\nfor the amplitude of the structure function is also consistent with the\nmeasurements carried out at parsec scales. Our measurements are hence\nconsistent with the \\HI opacity fluctuation in the Galaxy being characterized\nby a power law structure function over length scales that span six orders of\nmagnitude. This result implies that the dissipation scale has to be smaller\nthan a few AU if the fluctuations are produced by turbulence. This inferred\nsmaller dissipation scale implies that the dissipation occurs either in (i)\nregions with densities $\\gtrsim 10^3 $cm$^-3$ (i.e. similar to that inferred\nfor \"tiny scale\" atomic clouds or (ii) regions with a mix of ionized and atomic\ngas (i.e. the observed structure in the atomic gas has a magneto-hydrodynamic\norigin).\n", "  The advanced ENZ-theory of diffraction integrals, as published recently in J.\nEurop. Opt. Soc. Rap. Public. 8, 13044 (2013), presents the diffraction\nintegrals per Zernike term in the form of doubly infinite series. These double\nseries involve, aside from an overall azimuthal factor, the products of Jinc\nfunctions for the radial dependence and structural quantities $c_t$ that depend\non the optical parameters of the optical system (such as NA and refractive\nindices) and the defocus value. The products in the double series have\ncoefficients that are related to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and that depend on\nthe order of the Jinc function and the index $t$ of the structural quantity, as\nwell as on the azimuthal order and degree of the involved Zernike term. In\naddition, the structural quantities themselves are also given in the form of\ndoubly infinite series. In this paper, we give truncation rules for the various\ninfinite series depending on specified required accuracy.\n", "  We consider the quantised free Dirac field on oriented and globally\nhyperbolic ultrastatic slab spacetimes with compact spatial section and\ndemonstrate how a gauge invariant, pure and quasifree state on the\nC*-completion of the self-dual CAR-algebra can be extracted from the fermionic\nprojector construction of Finster and Reintjes. This state is analogous to the\n\"SJ-state\" of the free scalar field recently discussed in the literature. We\nprove that this state generically fails to be Hadamard. However, we also show\nhow a modified version of the construction, inspired by work of Brum and\nFredenhagen, yields states which are Hadamard. We also relate the Hadamard\ncondition to the finiteness of fluctuations of Wick polynomials.\n", "  We formulate generalizations of Pauli's theorem on the cases of real and\ncomplex Clifford algebras of even and odd dimensions. We give analogues of\nthese theorems in matrix formalism. Using these theorems we present an\nalgorithm for computing elements of spin groups that correspond to elements of\northogonal groups as double cover.\n", "  In this paper we prove isomorphisms between 5 Lie groups (of arbitrary\ndimension and fixed signatures) in Clifford algebra and classical matrix Lie\ngroups - symplectic, orthogonal and linear groups. Also we obtain isomorphisms\nof corresponding Lie algebras.\n", "  At the core of this article is an improved, sharp dispersive estimate for the\nanisotropic linear semigroup $e^{R_1 t}$ arising in both the study of the\ndispersive SQG equation and the inviscid Boussinesq system. We combine the\ndecay estimate with a blow-up criterion to show how dispersion leads to\nlong-time existence of solutions to the dispersive SQG equation, improving the\nresults obtained using hyperbolic methods. In the setting of the inviscid\nBoussinesq system it turns out that linearization around a specific stationary\nsolution leads to the same linear semigroup, so that we can make use of\nanalogous techniques to obtain stability of the stationary solution for an\nincreased timespan.\n", "  We construct the states and symmetries of N = 4 super-Yang-Mills by tensoring\ntwo N = 1 chiral multiplets and introducing two extra SUSY generators. This\nallows us to write the maximal N = 8 supergravity as four copies of the chiral\nmultiplet. We extend this to higher dimensions and discuss applications to\nscattering amplitudes.\n", "  Newtonian simulations are routinely used to examine the matter dynamics on\nnon-linear scales. However, even on these scales, Newtonian gravity is not a\ncomplete description of gravitational effects. A post-Friedmann approach shows\nthat the leading order correction to Newtonian theory is a vector potential in\nthe metric. This vector potential can be calculated from N-body simulations,\nrequiring a method for extracting the velocity field. Here, we present the full\ndetails of our calculation of the post-Friedmann vector potential, using the\nDelauney Tesselation Field Estimator (DTFE) code. We include a detailed\nexamination of the robustness of our numerical result, including the effects of\nbox size and mass resolution on the extracted fields. We present the power\nspectrum of the vector potential and find that the power spectrum of the vector\npotential is $\\sim 10^5$ times smaller than the power spectrum of the fully\nnon-linear scalar gravitational potential at redshift zero. Comparing our\nnumerical results to perturbative estimates, we find that the fully non-linear\nresult can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the perturbative\nestimate on small scales. We extend the analysis of the vector potential to\nmultiple redshifts, showing that this ratio persists over a range of scales and\nredshifts. We also comment on the implications of our results for the validity\nand interpretation of Newtonian simulations.\n", "  The split property expresses the way in which local regions of spacetime\ndefine subsystems of a quantum field theory. It is known to hold for general\ntheories in Minkowski space under the hypothesis of nuclearity. Here, the split\nproperty is discussed for general locally covariant quantum field theories in\narbitrary globally hyperbolic curved spacetimes, using a spacetime deformation\nargument to transport the split property from one spacetime to another. It is\nalso shown how states obeying both the split and (partial) Reeh-Schlieder\nproperties can be constructed, providing standard split inclusions of certain\nlocal von Neumann algebras. Sufficient conditions are given for the theory to\nadmit such states in ultrastatic spacetimes, from which the general case\nfollows. A number of consequences are described, including the existence of\nlocal generators for global gauge transformations, and the classification of\ncertain local von Neumann algebras. Similar arguments are applied to the distal\nsplit property and circumstances are exhibited under which distal splitting\nimplies the full split property.\n", "  The radio frequency 1.4 GHz transition of the atomic hydrogen is one of the\nimportant tracers of the diffuse neutral interstellar medium. Radio\nastronomical observations of this transition, using either a single dish\ntelescope or an array interferometer, reveal different properties of the\ninterstellar medium. Such observations are particularly useful to study the\nmultiphase nature and turbulence in the interstellar gas. Observations with\nmultiple radio telescopes have recently been used to study these two closely\nrelated aspects in greater detail. Using various observational techniques, the\ndensity and the velocity fluctuations in the Galactic interstellar medium was\nfound to have a Kolmogorov-like power law power spectra. The observed power law\nscaling of the turbulent velocity dispersion with the length scale can be used\nto derive the true temperature distribution of the medium. Observations from a\nlarge ongoing atomic hydrogen absorption line survey have also been used to\nstudy the distribution of gas at different temperature. The thermal steady\nstate model predicts that the multiphase neutral gas will exist in cold and\nwarm phase with temperature below 200 K and above 5000 K respectively. However,\nthese observations clearly show the presence of a large fraction of gas in the\nintermediate unstable phase. These results raise serious doubt about the\nvalidity of the standard model, and highlight the necessity of alternative\ntheoretical models. Interestingly, numerical simulations suggest that some of\nthe observational results can be explained consistently by including the\neffects of turbulence in the models of the multiphase medium. This review\narticle presents a brief outline of some of the basic ideas of radio\nastronomical observations and data analysis, summarizes the results from recent\nobservations, and discusses possible implications of the results.\n", "  The framework of locally covariant quantum field theory is discussed,\nmotivated in part using \"ignorance principles\". It is shown how theories can be\nrepresented by suitable functors, so that physical equivalence of theories may\nbe expressed via natural isomorphisms between the corresponding functors. The\ninhomogeneous scalar field is used to illustrate the ideas. It is argued that\nthere are two reasonable definitions of the local physical content associated\nwith a locally covariant theory; when these coincide, the theory is said to be\ndynamically local. The status of the dynamical locality condition is reviewed,\nas are its applications in relation to (a) the foundational question of what it\nmeans for a theory to represent the same physics in different spacetimes, and\n(b) a no-go result on the existence of natural states.\n", "  Most no-hair theorems involve the assumption that the scalar field is\nindependent of time. Recently in [Phys. Rev. D90 (2014) 041501(R)] the\nexistence of time-dependent scalar hair outside a stationary black hole in\ngeneral relativity was ruled out. We generalize this work to modified gravities\nand non-minimally coupled scalar field with an additional assumption that the\nspacetime is axisymmetric. It is shown that in higher-order gravity such as\nmetric $f(R)$ gravity the time-dependent scalar hair doesn't exist. While in\nPalatini $f(R)$ gravity and non-minimally coupled case the time-dependent\nscalar hair may exist.\n", "  Deflection angle for a light ray travelling in the equatorial plane of a\nrotating Kerr mass has been already calculated by various investigators.\nConsidering the light ray to be travelling only slightly above the equatorial\nplane, calculations have been made for such a ray for its deflection angle. In\nthis paper, we calculate deflection angles for the light ray at various\nheights, which are small compared to the impact parameter and derive\ncorresponding analytical expressions for deflection angle.\n", "  We theoretically show that the dipole force of an ensemble of quantum\nemitters embedded in a dielectric nanosphere can be exploited to achieve\nnear-field optical levitation. The key ingredient is that the polarizability\nfrom the ensemble of embedded quantum emitters can be larger than the bulk\npolarizability of the sphere, thereby enabling the use of repulsive optical\npotentials and consequently the levitation using optical near-fields. In\nlevitated cavity quantum optomechanics, this could be used to boost the\nsingle-photon coupling by combining larger polarizability to mass ratio, larger\nfield gradients, and smaller cavity volumes while remaining in the resolved\nsideband regime and at room temperature. A case study is done with a\nnanodiamond containing a high-density of silicon-vacancy color centers that is\noptically levitated in the evanescent field of a tappered nano-fiber and\ncoupled to a high-finesse microsphere cavity.\n", "  This topical review article gives an overview of the interplay between\nquantum information theory and thermodynamics of quantum systems. We focus on\nseveral trending topics including the foundations of statistical mechanics,\nresource theories, entanglement in thermodynamic settings, fluctuation theorems\nand thermal machines. This is not a comprehensive review of the diverse field\nof quantum thermodynamics; rather, it is a convenient entry point for the\nthermo-curious information theorist. Furthermore this review should facilitate\nthe unification and understanding of different interdisciplinary approaches\nemerging in research groups around the world.\n", "  A model for studying atomtronic devices and circuits based on finite\ntemperature Bose-condensed gases is presented. The approach involves\nnumerically solving equations of motion for atomic populations and coherences,\nderived using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and the Heisenberg picture. The\nresulting cluster expansion is truncated at a level giving balance between\nphysics rigor and numerical demand mitigation. This approach allows parametric\nstudies involving time scales that cover both the rapid population dynamics\nrelevant to non-equilibrium state evolution, as well as the much longer time\ndurations typical for reaching steady-state device operation. The model is\ndemonstrated by studying the evolution of a Bose-condensed gas in the presence\nof atom injection and extraction in a double-well potential. In this\nconfiguration phase-locking between condensates in each well of the potential\nis readily observed, and its influence on the evolution of the system is\nstudied.\n", "  Contemporary attempts to explain the existence of ultra-high energy cosmic\nrays using plasma-based wakefield acceleration deliberately avoid non-Standard\nModel particle physics. However, such proposals exploit some of the most\nextreme environments in the Universe and it is conceivable that hypothetical\nparticles outside the Standard Model have significant implications for the\neffectiveness of the acceleration process. Axions solve the strong CP problem\nand provide one of the most important candidates for Cold Dark Matter, and\ntheir potential significance in the present context should not be overlooked.\nOur analysis of the field equations describing a plasma augmented with axions\nuncovers a dramatic axion-induced suppression of the energy gained by a test\nparticle in the wakefield driven by a particle bunch, or an intense pulse of\nelectromagnetic radiation, propagating at ultra-relativistic speeds within the\nstrongest magnetic fields in the Universe.\n", "  We invoke integrals of Mellin-Barnes type to analytically continue the\nGopakumar-Vafa resummation of the topological string free energy in the string\ncoupling constant, leading to additional non-perturbative terms. We also\ndiscuss in a similar manner the refined and Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit version\nthereof. The derivation is straight-forward and essentially boils down to\ntaking residue. This allows us to confirm some related conjectures in the\nliterature at tree-level.\n", "  We construct the amplitudes of $\\pi\\eta$ photoproduction taking into account\nthe effects of the $\\pi\\eta$ - $K\\bar K$ interchannel coupling. The idea of our\nmodel is close to the molecular description of scalar resonances with exception\nthat apart from the pseudoscalar loops we include also vector mesons in the\nintermediate state loops. These amplitudes are used to calculate the $S$-wave\ncross sections and mass distributions in the $\\pi\\eta$ effective mass region\ncorresponding to the scalar resonances $a_0(980)$ and $a_0(1450)$. The values\nwe obtained for $a_0(980)$ are comparable with predictions of other models\nwhile the cross section for $a_0(1450)$ is about an order of magnitude larger\nthan prediction based on the quark model. We show that the amplitudes with\nloops containing vector mesons calculated in the on-shell approximation are not\nsuppressed in contrast to amplitudes containing only pseudoscalar loops. We\nestimate the cross sections for the $P$- and $D$- waves in the $\\pi\\eta$\nchannel.\n", "  This paper investigates the power of polynomial-time quantum computation in\nwhich only a very limited number of qubits are initially clean in the |0>\nstate, and all the remaining qubits are initially in the totally mixed state.\nNo initializations of qubits are allowed during the computation, nor\nintermediate measurements. The main results of this paper are unexpectedly\nstrong error-reducible properties of such quantum computations. It is proved\nthat any problem solvable by a polynomial-time quantum computation with\none-sided bounded error that uses logarithmically many clean qubits can also be\nsolvable with exponentially small one-sided error using just two clean qubits,\nand with polynomially small one-sided error using just one clean qubit. It is\nfurther proved in the case of two-sided bounded error that any problem solvable\nby such a computation with a constant gap between completeness and soundness\nusing logarithmically many clean qubits can also be solvable with exponentially\nsmall two-sided error using just two clean qubits. If only one clean qubit is\navailable, the problem is again still solvable with exponentially small error\nin one of the completeness and soundness and polynomially small error in the\nother. As an immediate consequence of the above result for the two-sided-error\ncase, it follows that the TRACE ESTIMATION problem defined with fixed constant\nthreshold parameters is complete for the classes of problems solvable by\npolynomial-time quantum computations with completeness 2/3 and soundness 1/3\nusing logarithmically many clean qubits and just one clean qubit. The\ntechniques used for proving the error-reduction results may be of independent\ninterest in themselves, and one of the technical tools can also be used to show\nthe hardness of weak classical simulations of one-clean-qubit computations\n(i.e., DQC1 computations).\n", "  In this paper, we present the synchrotron light curve at 610 MHz from the\nrecurrent nova V745 Sco following its outburst on 6 February 2014. The system\nhas been detected and periodically monitored with the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) since 9 February 2014 as part of the Galactic Nova with GMRT\n(GNovaG) project. The light curves are well fit by a model of synchrotron\nemitting region obscured by foreground thermal gas which eventually becomes\noptically thin to the low GMRT frequencies. We present the model fit to the\n2014 data on V745 Sco and discuss it alongwith the model fit to the 1.4 GHz\ndata of the recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi following its outburst in 1985.\n", "  We find necessary and sufficient conditions for a local geodesic flow of an\naffine connection on a surface to admit a linear first integral. The conditions\nare expressed in terms of two scalar invariants of differential orders 3 and 4\nin the connection. We use this result to find explicit obstructions to the\nexistence of a Hamiltonian formulation of Dubrovin--Novikov type for a given\none--dimensional system of hydrodynamic type. We give several examples\nincluding Zoll connections, and Hamiltonian systems arising from\ntwo--dimensional Frobenius manifolds.\n", "  We present observations at 610 MHz and 235 MHz using the Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) of the recurrent nova V745 Scorpii which recorded its\nlast outburst on 6 February 2014. This is the second symbiotic recurrent nova\nwhose light curve at low frequencies has been followed in detail, the first\nbeing RS Ophiuchi in 2006. We fitted the 610 MHz light curve by a model of\nsynchrotron emission from an expanding shell being modified by radiative\ntransfer effects due to local absorbing gas consisting of a uniformly\ndistributed and a clumpy component. Using our model parameters, we find that\nthe emission at 235 MHz peaked around day 35 which is consistent with our GMRT\nobservations. The two main results of our study are: (1) The radio emission at\na given frequency is visible sooner after the outburst in successive outbursts\nof both V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi. The earlier detection of radio emission\nis interpreted to be caused by decreasing foreground densities. (2) The clumpy\nmaterial, if exists, is close to the white dwarf and can be interpreted as\nbeing due to the material from the hot accretion disk. The uniform density gas\nis widespread and attributed to the winds blown by the white dwarf. We present\nimplications of these results on the evolution of both novae. Such studies\nalongwith theoretical understanding have the potential of resolving several\noutstanding issues such as why all recurrent novae are not detectable in\nsynchrotron radio and whether recurrent novae are progenitor systems of type 1a\nsupernova.\n", "  We analyse the process of energy exchanges generated by the elastic\ncollisions between a point-particle, confined to a two-dimensional cell with\nconvex boundaries, and a `piston', i.e. a line-segment, which moves back and\nforth along a one-dimensional interval partially intersecting the cell. This\nmodel can be considered as the elementary building block of a spatially\nextended high-dimensional billiard modeling heat transport in a class of hybrid\nmaterials exhibiting the kinetics of gases and spatial structure of solids.\nUsing heuristic arguments and numerical analysis, we argue that, in a regime of\nrare interactions, the billiard process converges to a Markov jump process for\nthe energy exchanges and obtain the expression of its generator.\n", "  Quantum physics can be exploited to generate true random numbers, which play\nimportant roles in many applications, especially in cryptography. Genuine\nrandomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature\nof quantumness --- coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum\nmechanics from classical physics. The generation of genuine randomness is\ngenerally considered impossible with only classical means. Based on the degree\nof trustworthiness on devices, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be\ngrouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on\nfully trusted and calibrated devices and typically can generate randomness at a\nhigh speed by properly modeling the devices. The second category is\nself-testing QRNG, where verifiable randomness can be generated without\ntrusting the actual implementation. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG,\nis an intermediate category which provides a tradeoff between the\ntrustworthiness on the device and the random number generation speed.\n", "  In the present work the steady-state crack propagation in a chain of\noscillators with non-local interactions is considered. The interactions are\nmodeled as linear springs while the crack is presented by the absence of extra\nsprings. The problem is reduced to the Wiener-Hopf type and solution is\npresented in terms of inverse Fourier transform. It is shown that the non-local\ninteractions may change the structure of the problem solution well-known from\nthe classical local interactions formulation. In particular, it may change the\nrange of the region of stable crack motion. The conclusions of the analysis are\nsupported by numerical results. Namely, the observed phenomenon is partially\nclarified by evaluation of the structure profiles on the crack line ahead.\n", "  In the current UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) and the Excellence in\nResearch for Australia (ERA) societal impact measurements are inherent parts of\nthe national evaluation systems. In this study, we deal with a relatively new\nform of societal impact measurements. Recently, Altmetric - a start-up\nproviding publication level metrics - started to make data for publications\navailable which have been mentioned in policy documents. We regard this data\nsource as an interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal)\nimpact of research. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate\nchange as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for impact\nmeasurement. Only 1.2% (n=2,341) out of 191,276 publications on climate change\nin the dataset have at least one policy mention. We further reveal that papers\npublished in Nature and Science as well as from the areas \"Earth and related\nenvironmental sciences\" and \"Social and economic geography\" are especially\nrelevant in the policy context. Given the low coverage of the climate change\nliterature in policy documents, this study can be only a first attempt to study\nthis new source of altmetric data. Further empirical studies are necessary in\nupcoming years, because mentions in policy documents are of special interest in\nthe use of altmetric data for measuring target-oriented the broader impact of\nresearch.\n", "  We study the onset of spin-density wave order in itinerant electron systems\nvia a two-dimensional lattice model amenable to numerically exact,\nsign-problem-free determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The\nfinite-temperature phase diagram of the model reveals a dome-shaped $d$-wave\nsuperconducting phase near the magnetic quantum phase transition. Above the\ncritical superconducting temperature, we observe an extended fluctuation\nregime, which manifests itself in the opening of a gap in the electronic\ndensity of states and an enhanced diamagnetic response. While charge density\nwave fluctuations are moderately enhanced in the proximity of the magnetic\nquantum phase transition, they remain short-ranged. The striking similarity of\nour results to the phenomenology of many unconventional superconductors points\na way to a microscopic understanding of such strongly coupled systems in a\ncontrolled manner.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the Halmiton-Jacobi method to determine several\nthermodynamic quantities such as the temperature, entropy and specific heat of\ntwo-dimensional Horava-Lifshitz black holes by using the generalized\nuncertainty principles (GUP). We also address the product of horizons, mainly\nconcerning the event, Cauchy, cosmological and virtual horizons.\n", "  Reflection statistics have not been well studied for optical random media\nwhose mean refractive indices do not match with the refractive indices of their\nsurrounding media. Here, we theoretically study how this refractive index\nmismatch between a one dimensional (1D) optical sample and its surrounding\nmedium affects the reflection statistics in the weak disorder limit, when the\nfluctuation part of the refractive index (dn) is much smaller than the mismatch\nas well as the mean refractive index of the sample (dn << <n>). In the\ntheoretical derivation, we perform a detailed calculation that results in the\nanalytical forms of mean and standard deviation (STD) of the reflectance in\nterms of disorder parameters (dn and lc) in an index mismatched backscattering\nsystem. Particularly, the orders of disorder parameters in STD of the\nreflectance for index mismatched systems is shown to be lower ( (<dn^2> lc\n)^1/2 ) than that of the matched systems (<dn^2> lc). By comparing STDs of the\nreflection coefficient of index matched and mismatched systems, we show that\nreflectance at the sample boundaries in index mismatched systems can enhance\nthe signal of the STD to the disorder parameters of the reflectance. In terms\nof biophotonics applications, this result can lead to potential techniques that\neffectively extract the sample disorder parameters by manipulating the index\nmismatch conditions. Potential applications of the technique for enhancement in\nsensitivity of cancer detection at single cell level are also discussed.\n", "  We study the effect of isospin-dependent nuclear forces on the pasta phase in\nthe inner crust of neutron stars. To this end we model the crust within the\nframework of quantum molecular dynamics (QMD). For maximizing the numerical\nperformance, a newly developed code has been implemented on GPU processors. As\na first application of the crust studies we investigate the dependence of the\nparticular pasta phases on the isospin dependence of the interaction, including\nnon-linear terms in this sector of the interactions. Our results indicate that\nin contrast to earlier studies the phase diagram of the pasta phase is not very\nsensitive to isospin effects. We show that the extraction of the isospin\nparameters like asymmetry energy and slope from numerical data is affected by\nhigher-order terms in the asymmetry dependence of the energies per particle.\nFurthermore, a rapid transition from the pasta to a homogeneous phase is\nobserved even for proton-to-neutron ratios typical for a supernova environment.\n", "  Two powerful theoretical predictions, Anderson localization and the Imry-Ma\nargument, impose significant restrictions on the phases of matter that can\nexist in the presence of even the smallest amount of disorder in\none-dimensional systems. These predictions forbid conducting states and ordered\nstates respectively. It was thus remarkable that a mechanism to circumvent\nAnderson localization relying on the presence of correlated disorder was found,\nthat is also realized in certain biomolecular systems. In a similar manner, we\nshow that the Imry-Ma argument can be circumvented resulting in the formation\nof stable ordered states with discrete broken symmetries in disordered one\ndimensional systems. Specifically, we simulate a family of Hamiltonians of\nspinless fermions with correlated disorder and interactions, where we find that\na charge density wave is stable up to a finite critical disorder strength.\nHaving circumvented the Imry-Ma mechanism, we then investigate other mechanisms\nby which disorder can destroy an ordered state.\n", "  We consider a higher-derivative extension of QED modified by the addition of\na gauge-invariant dimension-6 kinetic operator in the U(1) gauge sector. The\nFeynman diagrams at one-loop level are then computed. The modification in the\nspin-1 sector leads the electron self-energy and vertex corrections diagrams\nfinite in the ultraviolet regime. Indeed, no regularization prescription is\nused to calculate these diagrams because the modified propagator always occurs\ncoupled to conserved currents. Moreover, besides the usual massless pole in the\nspin-1 sector, there is the emergence of a massive one, which becomes complex\nwhen computing the radiative corrections at one-loop order. This imaginary part\ndefines the finite decay width of the massive mode. To check consistency, we\nalso derive the decay length using the electron--positron elastic scattering\nand show that both results are equivalent. Because the presence of this\nunstable mode, the standard renormalization procedures cannot be used and is\nnecessary adopt an appropriate framework to perform the perturbative\nrenormalization. For this purpose, we apply the complex-mass shell scheme (CMS)\nto renormalize the aforementioned model. As an application of the formalism\ndeveloped, we estimate a quantum bound on the massive parameter using the\nmeasurement of the electron anomalous magnetic moment and compute the Uehling\npotential. At the end, the renormalization group is analyzed.\n", "  Topological matter is a trending topic in condensed matter: From a\nfundamental point of view it has introduced new phenomena and tools, and for\ntechnological applications, it holds the promise of basic stable quantum\ncomputing. Similarly, the physics of localization by disorder, an old paradigm\nof obvious technological importance in the field, continues revealing surprises\nwhen new properties of matter appear. This work deals with the localization\nbehavior of electronic systems based on partite lattices with special attention\nto the role of topology. We find an unexpected result from the point of view of\nlocalization properties: A robust topological metallic state characterized by a\nnon--quantized Hall conductivity arises from strong disorder in class A (time\nreversal symmetry broken) insulators. The key issue is the nature of the\ndisorder realization: selective disorder in only one sublattice in systems\nbased on bipartite lattices. The generality of the result is based on the\npartite nature of most recent 2D materials as graphene or transition metal\ndichalcogenides, and the possibility of the physical realization of the\nparticular disorder demonstrated in ref. 1. An anomalous Hall metal arises also\nwhen the original clean insulator is topologically trivial.\n", "  Differentiation is a mathematical skill applied throughout science in order\nto describe the change of a function with respect to a dependent variable.\nThus, an intuitive understanding of differentiation is necessary to work with\nthe mathematical frameworks used to describe physical systems in the higher\nlevels of education. In order to obtain this intuition repeated practice is\nrequired. This paper presents the development of DiffGame, which consists of a\nseries of exercises that introduce the basic principles of differentiation for\nhigh-school students through game-like elements. DiffGame have been tested with\n117 first-year students from a single Danish high school, who did not have any\nprior training in differentiation. The students' learning was assessed by the\ndata obtained directly from DiffGame. The test demonstrated the efficacy of\nDiffGame, since students at all levels demonstrate a learning gain. In contrast\nto previous studies demonstrating most learning in the lower tier of students,\nthe middle tier of students (based on overall performance) exhibits the largest\nlearning gains.\n", "  We consider random search processes alternating stochastically between\ndiffusion and ballistic motion, in which the distribution function of ballistic\nmotion directions varies from point to point in space. The specific space\ndependence of the directional distribution together with the switching rates\nbetween the two modes of motion establishes a spatially inhomogeneous search\nstrategy. We show that the mean first passage times for several standard search\nproblems - narrow escape, reaction partner finding, reaction-escape - can be\nminimized with a directional distribution that is reminiscent of the spatial\norganization of the cytoskeleton filaments of cells with a centrosome: radial\nballistic transport from center to periphery and back, and ballistic transport\nin random directions within a concentric shell of thickness $\\Delta_{\\rm opt}$\nalong the domain boundary. The results suggest that living cells realize\nefficient search strategies for various intracellular transport problems\neconomically through a spatial cytoskeleton organization that involves radial\nmicrotubules in the central region and only a narrow actin cortex rather than a\ncell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.\n", "  The two criteria of ensemble equivalence, i.e. the macrostate equivalence and\nthe measure equivalence, are investigated for a general pair of states. The\nmacrostate equivalence implies the two ensembles are indistinguishable by the\nmeasurement of macroscopic quantities obeying the large-deviation principle,\nand the measure equivalence means that the specific relative entropy of these\ntwo states vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. It is shown that the measure\nequivalence implies the macrostate equivalence for a general pair of states by\nderiving an inequality connecting the large-deviation rate functions to the\nspecific relative Renyi entropies. The result is applicable to both quantum and\nclassical systems. As applications, a sufficient condition for thermalization,\nthe timescale of quantum dynamics of macrovariables, and the second law with\nstrict irreversibility in a quantum quench are discussed.\n", "  We describe 2016 January to April observations of the fragments of\n332P/Ikeya-Murakami, a comet earlier observed in a 2010 October outburst\n(Ishiguro et al 2014). We present photometry of the fragments, and perform\nsimulations to infer the time of breakup. We argue that the eastern-most\nrapidly brightening fragment ($F4$) best corresponds to the original nucleus,\nrather than the initial bright fragment $F1$. We compute radial and tangential\nnon-gravitational parameters, $A_1 = (1.5 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{-8}$ AU\nday$^{-2}$ and $(7.2 \\pm 1.9) \\times 10^{-9}$ AU day$^{-2}$; both are\nconsistent with zero at the $4\\sigma$ level. Monte Carlo simulations indicate\nthat the fragments were emitted on the outbound journey well after the 2010\noutburst, with bright fragment $F1$ splitting in mid--2013 and the fainter\nfragments within months of the 2016 January recovery. Western fragment $F7$ is\nthe oldest, dating from 2011. We suggest that the delayed onset of the\nsplitting is consistent with a self-propagating crystallization of water ice.\n", "  Establishing the strong converse theorem for a communication channel confirms\nthat the capacity of that channel, that is, the maximum achievable rate of\nreliable information communication, is the ultimate limit of communication over\nthat channel. Indeed, the strong converse theorem for a channel states that\ncoding at a rate above the capacity of the channel results in the convergence\nof the error to its maximum value 1 and that there is no trade-off between\ncommunication rate and decoding error. Here we prove that the strong converse\ntheorem holds for the product-state capacity of quantum channels with ergodic\nMarkovian correlated memory.\n", "  It is important to correctly subtract point sources from\nradio-interferometric data in order to measure the power spectrum of diffuse\nradiation like the Galactic synchrotron or the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm\nsignal. It is computationally very expensive and challenging to image a very\nlarge area and accurately subtract all the point sources from the image. The\nproblem is particularly severe at the sidelobes and the outer parts of the main\nlobe where the antenna response is highly frequency dependent and the\ncalibration also differs from that of the phase center. Here we show that it is\npossible to overcome this problem by tapering the sky response. Using simulated\n150 MHz observations, we demonstrate that it is possible to suppress the\ncontribution due to point sources from the outer parts by using the Tapered\nGridded Estimator to measure the angular power spectrum C_l of the sky signal.\nWe also show from the simulation that this method can self-consistently compute\nthe noise bias and accurately subtract it to provide an unbiased estimation of\nC_l.\n", "  We study superconformal and supergravity models with constrained superfields.\nThe underlying version of such models with all unconstrained superfields and\nlinearly realized supersymmetry is presented here, in addition to the physical\nmultiplets there are Lagrange multiplier (LM) superfields. Once the equations\nof motion for the LM superfields are solved, some of the physical superfields\nbecome constrained. The linear supersymmetry of the original models becomes\nnon-linearly realized, its exact form can be deduced from the original linear\nsupersymmetry. Known examples of constrained superfields are shown to require\nthe following LM's: chiral superfields, linear superfields, general complex\nsuperfields, some of them are multiplets with a spin.\n", "  Phase transitions in a classical Heisenberg spin model of a chiral helimagnet\nwith the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) interaction in three dimensions are\nnumerically studied. By using the event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm recently\ndeveloped for particle and continuous spin systems, we perform equilibrium\nMonte Carlo simulations for large systems up to about $10^6$ spins. Without\nmagnetic fields, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition with\ncritical exponents of the three-dimensional \\textit{XY} model, and a uniaxial\nperiodic helical structure emerges in the low temperature region. In the\npresence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the axis of the helical\nstructure, it is found that there exists a critical point on the temperature\nand magnetic-field phase diagram and that above the critical point the system\nexhibits a phase transition with strong divergence of the specific heat and the\nuniform magnetic susceptibility.\n", "  We propose a systematic procedure for the approximation of density\nfunctionals in density functional theory that consists of two parts. First, for\nthe efficient approximation of a general density functional, we introduce an\nefficient ansatz whose non-locality can be increased systematically. Second, we\npresent a fitting strategy that is based on systematically increasing a\nreasonably chosen set of training densities. We investigate our procedure in\nthe context of strongly correlated fermions on a one-dimensional lattice in\nwhich we compute accurate training densities with the help of matrix product\nstates. Focusing on the exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate how an\nefficient approximation can be found that includes and systematically improves\nbeyond the local density approximation. Importantly, this systematic\nimprovement is shown for target densities that are quite different from the\ntraining densities.\n", "  We present a complete cross-validation of significant wave heights (SWH)\nextracted from altimetry data from all ten existing satellites with available\nin situ (buoy and echosounder) wave measurements for the Baltic Sea basin. The\nmain purpose is to select an adequate altimetry data subset for a subsequent\nevaluation of the wave climate. The satellite measurements with the backscatter\ncoefficients > 13.5 cdb, errors in the SWH normalized standard deviation > 0.5\nm and snapshots with centroids closer than 0.2 degrees to the land are not\nreliable. The ice flag usually denotes the ice concentration of > 50%. The\npresence of ice affects the SWH data starting from concentrations 10%, but\nsubstantial effects are only evident for concentrations > 30%. The altimetry\ndata selected based on these criteria have very good correspondence with in\nsitu data, except for GEOSAT Phase 1 data (1985-1989) that could not be\nvalidated. The root-mean-square difference of altimetry and in situ data is in\nthe range of 0.23-0.37, which is significant for the Baltic Sea, compared with\nan average wave height of ~1 m. The bias for CRYOSAT-2, ERS-2, JASON-1/2 and\nSARAL data is below 0.06 m. The ENVISAT, ERS-1, GEOSAT and TOPEX satellites\nrevealed larger biases up to 0.23 m. The SWH time series from several satellite\npairs (ENVISAT/JASON-1, SARAL/JASON-2, ERS-1/TOPEX) exhibit substantial mutual\ntemporal drift and part of them evidently are not homogeneous in time. A new\nhigh-resolution SWH data set from the SARAL satellite reveals a very good\ncorrespondence with the in situ data and with the data stream from previous\nsatellites.\n", "  The Purcell factor $F_p$ is a key quantity in cavity quantum electrodynamics\n(cQED) that quantifies the coupling rate between a dipolar emitter and a cavity\nmode. Its simple form $F_p\\propto Q/V$ unravels the possible strategies to\nenhance and control light-matter interaction. Practically, efficient\nlight-matter interaction is achieved thanks to either i) high quality factor\n$Q$ at the basis of cQED or ii) low modal volume $V$ at the basis of\nnanophotonics and plasmonics. In the last decade, strong efforts have been done\nto derive a plasmonic Purcell factor in order to transpose cQED concepts to the\nnanocale, in a scale-law approach. In this work, we discuss the plasmonic\nPurcell factor for both delocalized (SPP) and localized (LSP)\nsurface-plasmon-polaritons and briefly summarize the expected applications for\nnanophotonics. On the basis of the SPP resonance shape (Lorentzian or Fano\nprofile), we derive closed form expression for the coupling rate to delocalized\nplasmons. The quality factor factor and modal confinement of both SPP and LSP\nare quantified, demonstrating their strongly subwavelength behaviour.\n", "  One of the open problems in understanding (0,2) mirror symmetry concerns the\nconstruction of Toda-like Landau-Ginzburg mirrors to (0,2) theories on Fano\nspaces. In this paper, we begin to fill this gap by making an ansatz for (0,2)\nToda-like theories mirror to (0,2) supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on\nproducts of projective spaces, with deformations of the tangent bundle,\ngeneralizing a special case previously worked out for P1xP1. We check this\nansatz by matching correlation functions of the B/2-twisted Toda-like theories\nto correlation functions of corresponding A/2-twisted nonlinear sigma models,\ncomputed primarily using localization techniques. These (0,2) Landau-Ginzburg\nmodels admit redundancies, which can lend themselves to multiple\ndistinct-looking representatives of the same physics, which we discuss.\n", "  A well-motivated conjecture states that the open topological string partition\nfunction on toric geometries in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit is annihilated\nby a difference operator called the quantum mirror curve. Recently, the complex\nstructure variables parameterizing the curve, which play the role of\neigenvalues for related operators, were conjectured to satisfy a quantization\ncondition non-perturbative in the NS parameter $\\hbar$. Here, we argue that\nthis quantization condition arises from requiring single-valuedness of the\npartition function, combined with the requirement of smoothness in the\nparameter $\\hbar$. To determine the monodromy of the partition function, we\nstudy the underlying difference equation in the framework of exact WKB.\n", "  The recent discovery of superconductivity under high pressure in the two-leg\nladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ [H. Takahashi et al., Nature Materials 14, 1008\n(2015)] opens a broad avenue of research, because it represents the first\nreport of pairing tendencies in a quasi one-dimensional iron-based high\ncritical temperature superconductor. Similarly as in the case of the cuprates,\nladders and chains can be far more accurately studied using many-body\ntechniques and model Hamiltonians than their layered counterparts, particularly\nif several orbitals are active. In this publication, we derive a two-orbital\nHubbard model from first principles that describes individual ladders of\nBaFe$_2$S$_3$. The model is studied with the density matrix renormalization\ngroup. These first reported results are exciting for two reasons: (i) at\nhalf-filling, ferromagnetic order emerges as the dominant magnetic pattern\nalong the rungs of the ladder, and antiferromagnetic order along the legs, in\nexcellent agreement with neutron experiments; (ii) pairs form in the strong\ncoupling regime, as found by studying the binding energy of two holes doped on\nthe half-filled system. In addition, Orbital Selective Mott Phase\ncharacteristics develop with doping, with only one Wannier orbital receiving\nthe hole carriers while the other remains half-filled. These results suggest\nthat the analysis of models for iron-based two-leg ladders could clarify the\norigin of pairing tendencies and other exotic properties of iron-based high\ncritical temperature superconductors.\n", "  Topological entanglement entropy has been regarded as a smoking-gun signature\nof topological order in two dimensions, capturing the total quantum dimension\nof the topological particle content. An extrapolation method on cylinders has\nbeen used frequently to measure the topological entanglement entropy. Here, we\nshow that a class of short-range entangled 2D states, when put on an infinite\ncylinder of circumference $L$, exhibits the entanglement R\\'enyi entropy of any\ninteger index $\\alpha \\ge 2$ that obeys $S_\\alpha = a L - \\gamma$ where $a,\n\\gamma > 0 $. Under the extrapolation method, the subleading term $\\gamma$\nwould be identified as the topological entanglement entropy, which is spurious.\nA nonzero $\\gamma$ is always present if the 2D state reduces to a certain\nsymmetry-protected topological 1D state, upon disentangling spins that are far\nfrom the entanglement cut. The internal symmetry that stabilizes $\\gamma > 0$\nis not necessarily a symmetry of the 2D state, but should be present after the\ndisentangling reduction. If the symmetry is absent, $\\gamma$ decays\nexponentially in $L$ with a characteristic length, termed as a replica\ncorrelation length, which can be arbitrarily large compared to the two-point\ncorrelation length of the 2D state. We propose a simple numerical procedure to\nmeasure the replica correlation length through replica correlation functions.\nWe also calculate the replica correlation functions for representative wave\nfunctions of abelian discrete gauge theories and the double semion theory in\n2D, to show that they decay abruptly to zero. This supports a conjecture that\nthe replica correlation length being small implies that the subleading term\nfrom the extrapolation method determines the total quantum dimension.\n", "  We derive the mass term of the Bardeen metric in the presence of a\nnoncommutative geometry induced minimal length. In this setup, the proposal of\na stable black hole remnant as a candidate to store information is confirmed.\nWe consider the possibility of having an extremal configuration with one\ndegenerate event horizon and compare different sizes of black hole remnants. As\na result, once the magnetic charge $g$ of the noncommutative Bardeen solution\nbecomes larger, both the minimal nonzero mass $M_0$ and the minimal nonzero\nhorizon radius $r_0$ get larger. This means, subsequently, under the condition\nof an adequate amount of $g$, the three parameters $g$, $M_0$, and $r_0$ are in\na connection with each other linearly. According to our results, a\nnoncommutative Bardeen black hole is colder than the noncommutative\nSchwarzschild black hole and its remnant is bigger, so the minimum required\nenergy for the formation of such a black hole at particle colliders will be\nlarger. We also find a closely similar result for the Hayward solution.\n", "  The exciting possibilities in the field of new quantum technologies extend\nfar beyond the well-reported application of quantum computing. Precision\ntiming, gravity sensors and imagers, cryptography, navigation, metrology,\nenergy harvesting and recovery, biomedical sensors and imagers, and real-time\noptimisers all indicate the potential for quantum technologies to provide the\nbasis of a technological revolution. From the field of Systems Engineering\nemerges a focused strategy for the development cycle, enabling the existence of\nhugely complex products. It is through the adoption of systems thinking that\nthe semiconductor industry has achieved massive industrial and economic impact.\nQuantum technologies rely on delicate, non-local and/or entangled degrees of\nfreedom - leading to great potential, but also posing new challenges to the\ndevelopment of products and industries. We discuss some of the challenges and\nopportunities regarding the implementation of Systems Engineering and systems\nthinking into the quantum technologies space.\n", "  This paper develops general space-efficient methods for error reduction for\nunitary quantum computation. Consider a polynomial-time quantum computation\nwith completeness $c$ and soundness $s$, either with or without a witness\n(corresponding to QMA and BQP, respectively). To convert this computation into\na new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method\nknown requires extra workspace of ${O \\bigl( p \\log \\frac{1}{c-s} \\bigr)}$\nqubits. This space requirement is too large for scenarios like\nlogarithmic-space quantum computations. This paper presents error-reduction\nmethods for unitary quantum computations (i.e., computations without\nintermediate measurements) that require extra workspace of just ${O \\bigl( \\log\n\\frac{p}{c-s} \\bigr)}$ qubits. This in particular gives the first methods of\nstrong amplification for logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations with\ntwo-sided bounded error. This also leads to a number of consequences in\ncomplexity theory, such as the uselessness of quantum witnesses in\nbounded-error logarithmic-space unitary quantum computations, the PSPACE upper\nbound for QMA with exponentially-small completeness-soundness gap, and strong\namplification for matchgate computations.\n", "  Theoretical investigation demonstrates that the composite bilayer (i.e.,\nchiral-magnetic/ferroelectric bilayer) offers the possibility of\nelectric-induced magnetic Skyrmions [Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{94}, 014311 (2016)].\nIn this Article, we propose a micromagnetic model to physically manipulate\nmagnetic Bloch Skyrmions propagating in a chiral-magnetic thin film with a\npolarized ferroelectric essential to drive the system through the converse\nmagnetoelectric effect. Effects caused by different velocities of the\npropagation, sizes of the thin film, and strength of the magnetoelectric\ncouplings strongly impact on quality and quantity of the magnetic Skyrmions.\n", "  We investigate Weyl semimetals with tilted conical bands in a magnetic field.\nEven when the cones are overtilted (type-II Weyl semimetal), Landau-level\nquantization can be possible as long as the magnetic field is oriented close to\nthe tilt direction. Most saliently, the tilt can be described within the\nrelativistic framework of Lorentz transformations that give rise to a rich\nspectrum, displaying new transitions beyond the usual dipolar ones in the\noptical conductivity. We identify particular features in the latter that allow\none to distinguish between semimetals of different types.\n", "  Next-generation space telescopes will observe the atmospheres of rocky\nplanets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Understanding these observations will require\nwell-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present\ntheoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of\ndry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them\nusing a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a\nradiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly\nrotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation\nacts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale\nwind speeds. Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which\nextends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find\nthat rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of\nwave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the\nvalue suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat\nengine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting\natmospheres. Fourth, we show using GCM simulations that rotation only has a\nstrong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our\nmodels let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b and\nshow how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of\nshort-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb\nSpace Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future\nobservations should pursue both techniques.\n", "  In this note we reformulate topological string theory using supermanifolds\nand supermoduli spaces, following the approach worked out by Witten for\nsuperstring perturbation theory in arXiv:1209.5461. We intend to make the\nconstruction geometrical in nature, by using supergeometry techniques\nextensively. The goal is to establish the foundation of studying topological\nstring amplitudes in terms of integration over appropriate supermoduli spaces.\n", "  The KKLT construction of dS vacua relies on an uplift term that arises from\nan anti-D3-brane. It was argued by Kachru, Pearson and Verlinde that this\nanti-D3-brane is an excited state in a supersymmetric theory since it can decay\nto a supersymmetric ground state. Hence the anti-D3-brane breaks supersymmetry\nspontaneously and one should be able to package all the world-volume fields on\nthe anti-D3-brane into a four dimensional $\\cal{N}=1$ supersymmetric action.\nHere we extend previous results and identify the constrained superfields that\ncorrespond to all the degrees of freedom on the anti-D3-brane. In particular,\nwe show explicitly that the four 4D worldvolume spinors give rise to\nconstrained chiral multiplets $S$ and $Y^i$, $i=1,2,3$ that satisfy\n$S^2=SY^i=0$. We also conjecture (and provide evidence in a forthcoming\npublication) that the vector field $A_\\mu$ and the three scalars $\\phi^i$ give\nrise to a field strength multiplet $W_\\alpha$ and three chiral multiplets $H^i$\nthat satisfy the constraints $S W_\\alpha= \\bar{D}_{\\dot \\alpha} (S \\bar\nH^i)=0$. This is the first time that such constrained multiplets appear in\nstring theory constructions.\n", "  We demonstrate near unity, broadband absorbing optoelectronic devices using\nsub-15 nm thick transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) of molybdenum and\ntungsten as van der Waals semiconductor active layers. Specifically, we report\nthat near-unity light absorption is possible in extremely thin (< 15 nm) Van\nder Waals semiconductor structures by coupling to strongly damped optical modes\nof semiconductor/metal heterostructures. We further fabricate Schottky junction\ndevices using these highly absorbing heterostructures and characterize their\noptoelectronic performance. Our work addresses one of the key criteria to\nenable TMDCs as potential candidates to achieve high optoelectronic efficiency.\n", "  There are some approaches, either based on General Relativity (GR) or\nmodified gravity, that use galaxy rotation curves to derive the matter density\nof the corresponding galaxy, and this procedure would either indicate a partial\nor a complete elimination of dark matter in galaxies. Here we review these\napproaches, clarify the difficulties on this inverted procedure, present a\nmethod for evaluating them, and use it to test two specific approaches that are\nbased on GR: the Cooperstock-Tieu (CT) and the Balasin-Grumiller (BG)\napproaches. Using this new method, we find that neither of the tested\napproaches can satisfactorily fit the observational data without dark matter.\nThe CT approach results can be significantly improved if some dark matter is\nconsidered, while for the BG approach no usual dark matter halo can improve its\nresults.\n", "  The present paper introduces a novel approach for modelling the governing,\nslow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated objects. This model is\nsufficiently simple and concise to enable designing a closed-loop controller,\ncapable of accurate vertical positioning of a carried object. The near-field\nacoustic levitation phenomenon exploits the compressibility, the nonlinearity\nand the viscosity of the gas trapped between a rapidly oscillating surface and\na freely suspended planar object, to elevate its time averaged pressure above\nthe ambient pressure. By these means, the vertical position of loads weighing\nup to several kilograms can be varied between dozens and hundreds of\nmicrometers. The simplified model developed in this paper is a second order\nordinary differential equation where the height-dependent stiffness and damping\nterms of the gas layer are derived explicitly. This simplified model replaces a\ntraditional model consisting of the equation of motion of the levitated object,\ncoupled to a nonlinear partial differential equation, accounting for the\nbehavior of the entrapped gas. Due to the relatively simple form of the model\ndeveloped here, it constitutes a convenient foundation for model based control\nalgorithms, governing the slow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated\nobjects. Indeed, based on the former, a height dependent, gain scheduled PID\ncontroller is developed and verified numerically and experimentally, both\nproviding satisfying results.\n", "  In 1862, George Boole derived an inequality for variables, now known as\nBoolean variables, that in his opinion represents a demarcation line between\npossible and impossible experience. This inequality forms an important\nmilestone in the epistemology of probability theory and probability measures.\n  In 1985 Leggett and Garg derived a physics related inequality, mathematically\nidentical to Boole's, that according to them represents a demarcation between\nmacroscopic realism and quantum mechanics. Their formalism, constructed for the\nmagnetic flux of SQUIDS, includes general features and applies also to many\nother quantum experiments.\n  We show that a wide gulf, a wide divide, separates the \"sense impressions\"\nand corresponding data, as well as the postulates of macroscopic realism, from\nthe mathematical abstractions that are used to derive the inequality of\nLeggett-Garg. If the gulf can be bridged, one may indeed derive the said\ninequality, which is then clearly a demarcation between possible and impossible\nexperience: it cannot be violated and is not violated by quantum theory. We\ndeduce from this fact that a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality does not\nmean that the SQUID-flux is not there when nobody looks, as Leggett-Garg\nsuggest, but instead that the probability measures may not be what Leggett-Garg\nhave assumed them to be, when no data can be secured that directly relate to\nthem. We show that similar considerations apply to other well known quantum\ninterpretation-puzzles including that of the two-slit experiment.\n", "  We present a numerical implementation of an active inclusion in a granular\nmaterial submitted to a biaxial test. We discuss the dependence of the response\nto this perturbation on two parameters: the intra-granular friction coefficient\non one hand, the degree of the loading on the other hand. We compare the\nnumerical results to theoretical predictions taking into account the change of\nvolume of the inclusion as well as the anisotropy of the elastic matrix.\n", "  Allosteric regulation is central to many biochemical processes. Allosteric\nsites provide a target to fine-tune protein activity, yet we lack computational\nmethods to predict them. Here, we present an efficient graph-theoretical\napproach for identifying allosteric sites and the mediating interactions that\nconnect them to the active site. Using an atomistic graph with edges weighted\nby covalent and non-covalent bond energies, we obtain a bond-to-bond propensity\nthat quantifies the effect of instantaneous bond fluctuations propagating\nthrough the protein. We use this propensity to detect the sites and\ncommunication pathways most strongly linked to the active site, assessing their\nsignificance through quantile regression and comparison against a reference set\nof 100 generic proteins. We exemplify our method in detail with three\nwell-studied allosteric proteins: caspase-1, CheY, and h-Ras, correctly\npredicting the location of the allosteric site and identifying key allosteric\ninteractions. Consistent prediction of allosteric sites is then attained in a\nfurther set of 17 proteins known to exhibit allostery. Because our propensity\nmeasure runs in almost linear time, it offers a scalable approach to\nhigh-throughput searches for candidate allosteric sites.\n", "  We consider a question which curiously had not been properly considered so\nfar: in the standard seesaw model what is the minimum value the mass of a\nright-handed (RH) neutrino must have for allowing successful leptogenesis via\nCP-violating decays? To answer this question requires to take into account a\nnumber of thermal effects. We show that, for low RH neutrino masses and thanks\nto these effects, leptogenesis turns out to proceed efficiently from the decay\nof the Standard Model (SM) scalar doublet components into a RH neutrino and a\nlepton. Such decays produce the asymmetry at low temperatures, slightly before\nsphaleron decoupling. If the RH neutrino has thermalized prior from producing\nthe asymmetry, this mechanism turns out to lead to the bound $m_N>2$ GeV. If,\ninstead, the RH neutrinos have not thermalized, leptogenesis from these decays\nis enhanced further and can be easily successful, even at lower scales. This\nHiggs-decay leptogenesis new mechanism works without requiring an interplay of\nflavor effects and/or cancellations of large Yukawa couplings in the neutrino\nmass matrix. Last but not least, such a scenario turns out to be testable, from\ndirect production of the RH neutrino(s).\n", "  Band edge photocurrent spectra are typically observed in either of two\nshapes: a peak or a step. In this study, we show that the photocurrent band\nedge response of a GaN layer forms a peak, while the same response in GaN\nnanowires takes the form of a step, both are red-shifted to the actual band\nedge energy. Although this apparent inconsistency is not limited to GaN, the\nphysics of this phenomenon has been unclear. To understand the physics behind\nthese observations, we propose a model explaining the apparent discrepancy as\nresulting from a structure-dependent surface-effect. To test the model, we\nexperiment with a GaAs layer showing that we can deliberately switch between a\nstep and a peak. We demonstrate that using this quantitative model one may\nobtain the exact band edge transition energy, regardless of the red-shift\nvariance, as well as the density of the surface state charges that cause the\nred shift. The model thus adds quantitative features to photocurrent\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Precise photometry from the Kepler space telescope allows not only the\nmeasurement of rotation in solar-type field stars, but also the determination\nof reliable masses and ages from asteroseismology. These critical data have\nrecently provided the first opportunity to calibrate rotation-age relations for\nstars older than the Sun. The evolutionary picture that emerges is surprising:\nbeyond middle-age the efficiency of magnetic braking is dramatically reduced,\nimplying a fundamental change in angular momentum loss beyond a critical Rossby\nnumber (Ro~2). We compile published chromospheric activity measurements for the\nsample of Kepler asteroseismic targets that were used to establish the new\nrotation-age relations. We use these data along with a sample of well\ncharacterized solar analogs from the Mount Wilson HK survey to develop a\nqualitative scenario connecting the evolution of chromospheric activity to a\nfundamental shift in the character of differential rotation. We conclude that\nthe Sun may be in a transitional evolutionary phase, and that its magnetic\ncycle might represent a special case of stellar dynamo theory.\n", "  The Monte Carlo event generator HYDJET++ is one of the few generators,\ndesigned for the calculations of heavy-ion collisions at ultrarelativistic\nenergies, which combine treatment of soft hydro-like processes with the\ndescription of jets traversing the hot and dense partonic medium. The model is\nemployed to study the azimuthal anisotropy phenomena, dihadron angular\ncorrelations and event-by-event (EbyE) fluctuations of the anisotropic flow in\nPb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76$ TeV. The interplay of soft and hard\nprocesses describes the violation of the mass hierarchy of meson and baryon\nelliptic and triangular flows at p_T > 2 GeV/c, the fall-off of the flow\nharmonics at intermediate transverse momenta, and the worsening of the\nnumber-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic/triangular flow at LHC\ncompared to RHIC energies. The cross-talk of v_2 and v_3 leads to emergence of\nhigher order harmonics in the model and to appearance of the ridge structure in\ndihadron angular correlations in a broad pseudorapidity range. HYDJET++\npossesses also the dynamical EbyE fluctuations of the anisotropic flow. The\nmodel results agree well with the experimental data.\n", "  We study a model of interacting spinless fermions in a one dimensional\nlattice with supersymmetry (SUSY). The Hamiltonian is given by the\nanti-commutator of two supercharges $Q$ and $Q^\\dagger$, each of which is\ncomprised solely of fermion operators and possesses one adjustable parameter\n$g$. When the parameter $g$ vanishes, the model is identical to the one studied\nby Nicolai [H. Nicolai, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. \\textbf{9}, 1497 (1976)], where\nthe zero-energy ground state is exponentially degenerate. On the other hand, in\nthe large-$g$ limit the model reduces to the free-fermion chain with a\nfour-fold degenerate ground state. We show that for finite chains SUSY is\nspontaneously broken when $g > 0$. We also rigorously prove that for\nsufficiently large $g$ the ground-state energy density is nonvanishing in the\ninfinite-volume limit. We further analyze the nature of the low-energy\nexcitations by employing various techniques such as rigorous inequalities,\nexact numerical diagonalization, and renormalization group method with\nbosonization. The analysis reveals that the low-energy excitations are\ndescribed by massless Dirac fermions (or Thirring fermions more generally),\nwhich can be thought of as Nambu-Goldstone fermions from the spontaneous SUSY\nbreaking.\n", "  The drift in the redshift of objects passively following the cosmological\nexpansion has long been recognized as a key model-independent probe of\ncosmology. Here, we study the cosmological relevance of measurements of time or\nredshift derivatives of this drift, arguing that the combination of first and\nsecond redshift derivatives is a powerful test of the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nmodel. In particular, the latter can be obtained numerically from a set of\nmeasurements of the drift at different redshifts. We show that, in the\nlow-redshift limit, a measurement of the derivative of the drift can provide a\nconstraint on the jerk parameter, which is $j=1$ for flat $\\Lambda$CDM, while\ngenerically $j\\neq1$ for other models. We emphasize that such a measurement is\nwell within the reach of the ELT-HIRES and SKA Phase 2 array surveys.\n", "  Life on Earth relies on chiral molecules, that is, species not superimposable\non their mirror images. This manifests itself in the selection of a single\nmolecular handedness, or homochirality, across the biosphere. We present the\nastronomical detection of a chiral molecule, propylene oxide (CH$_3$CHCH$_2$O),\nin absorption toward the Galactic Center. Propylene oxide is detected in the\ngas phase in a cold, extended molecular shell around the embedded, massive\nprotostellar clusters in the Sagittarius B2 star-forming region. This material\nis representative of the earliest stage of solar system evolution in which a\nchiral molecule has been found.\n", "  Concepts from information geometry are used to analyse parameter sensitivity\nfor a nuclear energy density functional, representative of a class of\nsemi-empirical functionals that start from a microscopically motivated ansatz\nfor the density dependence of the energy of a system of protons and neutrons.\nIt is shown that such functionals are sloppy, characterized by an exponential\nrange of sensitivity to parameter variations. Responsive to only a few stiff\nparameter combinations, they exhibit an exponential decrease of sensitivity to\nvariations of the remaining soft parameters. By interpreting the space of model\npredictions as a manifold embedded in the data space, with the parameters of\nthe functional as coordinates on the manifold, it is also shown that the\nexponential distribution of model manifold widths corresponds to the\ndistribution of parameter sensitivity. Using the Manifold Boundary\nApproximation Method, we illustrate how to systematically construct effective\nnuclear density functionals of successively lower dimension in parameter space\nuntil sloppiness is eventually eliminated and the resulting functional contains\nonly stiff combinations of parameters.\n", "  We study the many-body phases of bosonic atoms with $N$ internal states\nconfined to a 1D optical lattice under the influence of a synthetic magnetic\nfield and strong repulsive interactions. The $N$ internal states of the atoms\nare coupled via Raman transitions creating the synthetic magnetic field in the\nspace of internal spin states corresponding to recent experimental\nrealisations. We focus on the case of strong $\\mbox{SU}(N)$ invariant local\ndensity-density interactions in which each site of the 1D lattice is at most\nsingly occupied, and strong Raman coupling, in distinction to previous work\nwhich has focused on the weak Raman coupling case. This allows us to keep only\na single state per site and derive a low energy effective spin $1/2$ model. The\neffective model contains first-order nearest neighbour tunnelling terms, and\nsecond-order nearest neighbour interactions and correlated next-nearest\nneighbour tunnelling terms. By adjusting the flux $\\phi$ one can tune the\nrelative importance of first-order and second-order terms in the effective\nHamiltonian. In particular, first-order terms can be set to zero, realising a\nnovel model with dominant second-order terms. We show that the resulting\ncompetition between density-dependent tunnelling and repulsive density-density\ninteraction leads to an interesting phase diagram including a phase with\nlong-ranged pair-superfluid correlations. The method can be straightforwardly\nextended to higher dimensions and lattices of arbitrary geometry including\ngeometrically frustrated lattices where the interplay of frustration,\ninteractions and kinetic terms is expected to lead to even richer physics.\n", "  A very active area of materials research is to devise methods that use\nmachine learning to automatically extract predictive models from existing\nmaterials data. While prior examples have demonstrated successful models for\nsome applications, many more applications exist where machine learning can make\na strong impact. To enable faster development of machine-learning-based models\nfor such applications, we have created a framework capable of being applied to\na broad range of materials data. Our method works by using a chemically diverse\nlist of attributes, which we demonstrate are suitable for describing a wide\nvariety of properties, and a novel method for partitioning the data set into\ngroups of similar materials in order to boost the predictive accuracy. In this\nmanuscript, we demonstrate how this new method can be used to predict diverse\nproperties of crystalline and amorphous materials, such as band gap energy and\nglass-forming ability.\n", "  We study the driven critical dynamics with an equilibrium initial state near\na quantum critical point. In contrast to the original Kibble-Zurek mechanism,\nwhich describes the driven dynamics starting from an adiabatic stage that is\nfar from the critical point, the initial adiabacity is broken in this scenario.\nAs a result, the scaling behavior cannot be described by the original\nKibble-Zurek scaling. In this work we propose a scaling theory, which includes\nthe initial parameters as additional scaling variables, to characterize the\nscaling behavior. In particular, this scaling theory can be used to describe\nthe driven scaling behavior starting from a finite-temperature equilibrium\nstate near a quantum critical point. We numerically confirm the scaling theory\nby simulating the real-time dynamics of the one-dimensional quantum Ising model\nat both zero and finite temperatures.\n", "  We consider the time evolution of nearly degenerate two-state systems with an\nexternal interaction. Conditions in which full population transfer is possible\nwhen the two-states become degenerate are considered. A new variation of the\ncoupled differential equations for the probability amplitudes suggests a\npossible singularity in the time evolution of the system. The singularity\noccurs at the point in time where full control in the degenerate limit is\nachieved. We solve this new variation to derive more information about\nnon-degenerate population control. The new results of numerical calculations\nfor occupational probabilities of non-degenerate systems are presented and\ninterpreted. These results are used to understand how population control breaks\ndown as the photon energy and the energy of the system are changed.\nApplications are discussed, with an emphasis on interactions of twisted-vortex\nand plane-wave photons with a variety of targets, including macroscopic gas\ncells of atoms, of large single crystals, and of molecules.\n", "  This work investigates how a thermal diode can be designed from a nematic\nliquid crystal confined inside a cylindrical capillary. In the case of\nhomeotropic anchoring, a defect structure called escaped radial disclination\narises. The asymmetry of such structure causes thermal rectification rates up\nto 3.5\\% at room temperature, comparable to thermal diodes made from carbon\nnanotubes. Sensitivity of the system with respect the heat power supply, the\ngeometry of the capillary tube and the molecular anchoring angle is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  A QCD axion with a time-dependent decay constant has been known to be able to\naccommodate high-scale inflation without producing topological defects or too\nlarge isocurvature perturbations on CMB scales. We point out that a dynamical\ndecay constant also has the effect of enhancing the small-scale axion\nisocurvature perturbations. The enhanced axion perturbations can even exceed\nthe periodicity of the axion potential, and thus lead to the formation of\naxionic domain walls. Unlike the well-studied axionic walls, the walls produced\nfrom the enhanced perturbations are not bounded by cosmic strings, and thus\nwould overclose the universe independently of the number of degenerate vacua\nalong the axion potential.\n", "  Defects in planar and vertically oriented nanographitic structures (NGSs)\nsynthesized by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) has been\ninvestigated using Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. While Raman\nspectra reveal the dominance of vacancy and boundary type defects respectively\nin vertical and planar NGSs, XPS provides additional information on vacancy\nrelated defect peaks at C 1s spectrum that originate from non-conjugated carbon\natoms in hexagonal lattice. Although an excellent correlation prevails between\nthese two techniques, our results show that estimation of surface defects by\nXPS is more accurate than Raman analysis. Nuances of these techniques are\ndiscussed in the context of assessing defects in nanographitic structures.\n", "  The presence of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs) in solar system meteorites\nhas been interpreted as evidence that the solar system was exposed to a\nsupernova shortly before or during its formation. Yet results from\nhydrodynamical models of SLR injection into the proto-solar cloud or disc\nsuggest that gas-phase mixing may not be efficient enough to reproduce the\nobserved abundances. As an alternative, we explore the injection of SLRs via\ndust grains as a way to overcome the mixing barrier. We numerically model the\ninteraction of a supernova remnant containing SLR-rich dust grains with a\nnearby molecular cloud. The dust grains are subject to drag forces and both\nthermal and non-thermal sputtering. We confirm that the expanding gas shell\nstalls upon impact with the dense cloud and that gas-phase SLR injection occurs\nslowly due to hydrodynamical instabilities at the cloud surface. In contrast,\ndust grains of sufficient size (> 1 micron) decouple from the gas and penetrate\ninto the cloud within 0.1 Myr. Once inside the cloud, the dust grains are\ndestroyed by sputtering, releasing SLRs and rapidly enriching the dense\n(potentially star-forming) regions. Our results suggest that SLR transport on\ndust grains is a viable mechanism to explain SLR enrichment.\n", "  Magnetoelectric coupling in ferromagnet/multiferroic systems is often\nmanifested in the exchange bias effect, which may have combined contributions\nfrom multiple sources, such as domain walls, chemical defects or strain. In\nthis study we magnetically \"fingerprint\" the coupling behavior of CoFe grown on\nepitaxial BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films by magnetometry and\nfirst-order-reversal-curves (FORC). The contribution to exchange bias from\n71{\\deg}, 109{\\deg} and charged ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) was elucidated\nby the FORC distribution. CoFe samples grown on BFO with 71{\\deg} DWs only\nexhibit an enhancement of the coercivity, but little exchange bias. Samples\ngrown on BFO with 109{\\deg} DWs and mosaic DWs exhibit a much larger exchange\nbias, with the main enhancement attributed to 109{\\deg} and charged DWs. Based\non the Malozemoff random field model, a varying-anisotropy model is proposed to\naccount for the exchange bias enhancement. This work sheds light on the\nrelationship between the exchange bias effect of the CoFe/BFO heterointerface\nand the ferroelectric DWs, and provides a path for multiferroic device analysis\nand design.\n", "  The observational cosmology with distant Type Ia supernovae (SNe) as standard\ncandles claims that the Universe is in accelerated expansion, caused by a large\nfraction of dark energy. In this paper we investigate the SN Ia environment,\nstudying the impact of the nature of their host galaxies on the Hubble diagram\nfitting. The supernovae (192 SNe) used in the analysis were extracted from\nJoint-Light-curves-Analysis (JLA) compilation of high-redshift and nearby\nsupernovae which is the best one to date. The analysis is based on the\nempirical fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light curve shapes and\ncolors. We confirm that the stretch parameter of Type Ia supernovae is\ncorrelated with the host galaxy type. The supernovae with lower stretch are\nhosted mainly in elliptical and lenticular galaxies. No significant correlation\nbetween SN Ia colour and host morphology was found.\n  We also examine how the luminosities of SNe Ia change depending on host\ngalaxy morphology after stretch and colour corrections. Our results show that\nin old stellar populations and low dust environments, the supernovae are\nslightly fainter. SNe Ia in elliptical and lenticular galaxies have a higher\n$\\alpha$ (slope in luminosity-stretch) and $\\beta$ (slope in luminosity-colour)\nparameter than in spirals. However, the observed shift is at the 1-$\\sigma$\nuncertainty level and, therefore, can not be considered as significant.\n  We confirm that the supernova properties depend on their environment and that\nthe incorporation of a host galaxy term into the Hubble diagram fit is expected\nto be crucial for future cosmological analyses.\n", "  The decay of instable nuclei is being used in a broad range of applications\nfrom detector calibration to power sources. As the public acceptance of\nclassical fission nuclear technology is decaying and its integral costs are\nenormous, alternative production routes are required. The mathematical\nformalism and fundamental considerations are presented for the use of ion\naccelerators for isotope production. A focus is put on the production of\nnuclear power sources to substitute Pu-238 based batteries. 20 MeV protons are\nfound to produce {\\alpha} emitting polonium isotopes from bismuth with an\nenergy efficiency of up to 0.031%. Some hours are required to produce a 1Wth\npower source of the 2.9 year half-life {\\alpha} emitter Po-208 with a suitable\naccelerator. The accelerator approach offers more flexibility for tailoring of\nnuclear products and less waste. The technical requirements are close to and\ncompatible with the planned International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility\naccelerator\n", "  A general sketch on how the problem of space dimensionality depends on\nanthropic arguments is presented. Several examples of how life has been used to\nconstraint space dimensionality (and vice-versa) are reviewed. In particular,\nthe influences of three-dimensionality in the solar system stability and the\norigin of life on Earth are discussed. New constraints on space dimensionality\nand on its invariance in very large spatial and temporal scales are also\nstressed.\n", "  A new lattice Boltzmann scheme associated with flexible specific heat ratio\nis proposed. The new free degree is introduced via the internal energy\nassociated with the internal structure. The evolution equation of the\ndistribution function is reduced to two evolution equations. One is connected\nto the density and velocity, the other is of the energy. A two-dimensional\nlattice Boltzmann model and a three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model are\nderived via the Hermite expansion. The two lattice Boltzmann models are applied\nto simulating the shock tube of one dimension. Good agreement between the\nnumerical results and the analytical solutions are obtained.\n", "  Hair bundles are biological oscillators that actively transduce mechanical\nstimuli into electrical signals in the auditory, vestibular, and lateral-line\nsystems of vertebrates. A bundle's function can be explained in part by its\noperation near a particular type of bifurcation, a qualitative change in\nbehavior. By operating near different varieties of bifurcation, the bundle\nresponds best to disparate classes of stimuli. We show how to determine the\nidentity of and proximity to distinct bifurcations despite the presence of\nsubstantial environmental noise.\n", "  We present new, wide-field, optical ($u'g'r'i'z'$) Dark Energy Camera\nobservations covering $\\sim21\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ centred on the nearby giant\nelliptical galaxy NGC5128 called \"The Survey of Centaurus A's Baryonic\nStructures\" (SCABS). The data reduction and analysis procedures are described\nincluding initial source detection, photometric and astrometric calibration,\nimage stacking, and point-spread function modelling. We estimate 50 and 90\npercent, field-dependent, point-source completeness limits of at least\n$u'=24.08$ and $23.62$ mag (AB), $g'=22.67$ and $22.27$ mag, $r'=22.46$ and\n$22.00$ mag, $i'=22.05$ and $21.63$ mag, and $z'=21.71$ and $21.34$ mag. Deeper\nimaging in the $u'$-, $i'$- and $z'$-bands provide the fainter limits for the\ninner $\\sim3\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ of the survey, and we find very stable photometric\nsensitivity across the entire field of view. Source catalogues are released in\nall filters including spatial, photometric, and morphological information for a\ntotal of $\\sim5\\times10^5-1.5\\times10^6$ detected sources (filter-dependent).\nWe finish with a brief discussion of potential science applications for the\ndata including, but not limited to, upcoming works by the SCABS team.\n", "  The Hyades open cluster was targeted during Campaign 4 (C4) of the NASA K2\nmission, and short-cadence data were collected on a number of cool\nmain-sequence stars. Here, we report results on two F-type stars that show\ndetectable oscillations of a quality that allows asteroseismic analyses to be\nperformed. These are the first ever detections of solar-like oscillations in\nmain-sequence stars in an open cluster.\n", "  The distribution of Milky Way halo blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars is\nexamined using action-based extended distribution functions (EDFs) that\ndescribe the locations of stars in phase space, metallicity, and age. The\nparameters of the EDFs are fitted using stars observed in the Sloan Extension\nfor Galactic Understanding and Exploration-II (SEGUE-II) survey that trace the\nphase-space kinematics and chemistry out to ~70 kpc. A maximum a posteriori\nprobability (MAP) estimate method and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method are\napplied, taking into account the selection function in positions, distance, and\nmetallicity for the survey. The best-fit EDF declines with actions less steeply\nat actions characteristic of the inner halo than at the larger actions\ncharacteristic of the outer halo, and older ages are found at smaller actions\nthan at larger actions. In real space, the radial density profile steepens\nsmoothly from -2 at ~2 kpc to -4 in the outer halo, with an axis ratio ~0.7\nthroughout. There is no indication for rotation in the BHBs, although this is\nhighly uncertain. A moderate level of radial anisotropy is detected, with\n$\\beta_s$ varying from isotropic to between ~0.1 and ~0.3 in the outer halo\ndepending on latitude. The BHB data are consistent with an age gradient of\n-0.03 Gyr kpc$^{-1}$, with some uncertainty in the distribution of the larger\nages. These results are consistent with a scenario in which older, larger\nsystems contribute to the inner halo, whilst the outer halo is primarily\ncomprised of younger, smaller systems.\n", "  Mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy offers unparalleled sensitivity for the\ndetection of trace gases, solids and liquids, which is based on the existence\nof strong telltale vibrational bands in this part of the spectrum. It was shown\nmore than a decade ago that a dual-comb Fourier spectroscopy could provide\nsuperior spectral coverage combined with high resolution and extremely fast\ndata acquisition. Capabilities of this method were limited because of\ndifficulty of producing twins of mutually coherent frequency combs in the mid-\nIR. Here we report a phase-coherent and broadband dual-comb system that is\nbased on a pair of subharmonic (frequency-divide-by-two) optical parametric\noscillators, pumped in turn by two phase-locked thulium fiber lasers at\n2-micron wavelength. We demonstrate simultaneous detection of multiple\nmolecular species in the whole band of 3.2-5.3 microns (frequency span 1200\ncm^{-1}) augmented by the pump laser band of 1.85-2 microns (span 400 cm^{-1}),\nwith spectral resolution 0.01-0.07 cm^{-1} and acquisition speed of up to\n160,000 resolution elements in few seconds.\n", "  The stellar magnetic field plays a crucial role in the star internal\nmechanisms, as in the interactions with its environment. The study of starspots\nprovides information about the stellar magnetic field, and can characterise the\ncycle. Moreover, the analysis of solar-type stars is also useful to shed light\nonto the origin of the solar magnetic field. The objective of this work is to\ncharacterise the magnetic activity of stars. Here, we studied two solar-type\nstars Kepler-17 and Kepler-63 using two methods to estimate the magnetic cycle\nlength. The first one characterises the spots (radius, intensity, and location)\nby fitting the small variations in the light curve of a star caused by the\noccultation of a spot during a planetary transit. This approach yields the\nnumber of spots present in the stellar surface and the flux deficit subtracted\nfrom the star by their presence during each transit. The second method\nestimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of the transit\nlightcurves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless model transit\nfrom the lightcurve, and then integrating all the residuals during the transit.\nThe presence of long term periodicity is estimated in both time series. With\nthe first method, we obtained $P_{\\rm cycle}$ = 1.12 $\\pm$ 0.16 yr (Kepler-17)\nand $P_{\\rm cycle}$ = 1.27 $\\pm$ 0.16 yr (Kepler-63), and for the second\napproach the values are 1.35 $\\pm$ 0.27 yr and 1.27 $\\pm$ 0.12 yr,\nrespectively. The results of both methods agree with each other and confirm\ntheir robustness.\n", "  There are various physical scenarios in which one can only implement\noperations with a certain symmetry. Under such restriction, a system in a\nsymmetry-breaking state can be used as a catalyst, e.g. to prepare another\nsystem in a desired symmetry-breaking state. This sort of (approximate)\ncatalytic state transformations are relevant in the context of (i) state\npreparation using a bounded-size quantum clock or reference frame, where the\nclock or reference frame acts as a catalyst, (ii) quantum thermodynamics, where\nagain a clock can be used as a catalyst to prepare states which contain\ncoherence with respect to the system Hamiltonian, and (iii) cloning of unknown\nquantum states, where the given copies of state can be interpreted as a\ncatalyst for preparing the new copies. Using a recent result of Fawzi and\nRenner on approximate recoverability, we show that the achievable accuracy in\nthis kind of catalytic transformations can be determined by a single function,\nnamely the relative entropy of asymmetry, which is equal to the difference\nbetween the entropy of state and its symmetrized version: if the desired state\ntransition does not require a large increase of this quantity, then it can be\nimplemented with high fidelity using only symmetric operations. Our lower bound\non the achievable fidelity is tight in the case of cloners, and can be achieved\nusing the Petz recovery map, which interestingly turns out to be the optimal\ncloning map found by Werner.\n", "  The tensor product of $L$ copies of a single vector, such as $p_{i_1} ...\np_{i_L}$, can be analyzed in terms of angular momentum. When $p_{i_1} ...\np_{i_L}$ is decomposed into a sum of components $( p_{i_1} ... p_{i_L}\n)^L_\\ell$, each characterized by angular momentum $\\ell$, the components are in\ngeneral complicated functions of the $p_i$ vectors, especially so for large\n$\\ell$. We obtain a compact expression for $( p_{i_1} ... p_{i_L} )^L_\\ell$\nexplicitly in terms of the $p_i$ valid for all $L$ and $\\ell$. We use this\ndecomposition to perform three-dimensional Fourier transforms of functions like\n$p^n \\hat p_{i_1} ... \\hat p_{i_L}$ that are useful in describing particle\ninteractions.\n", "  This talk focuses on the role of light scalars in cosmology, both Nambu\nGoldstone bosons and pseudo moduli. The former include QCD axions, which might\nconstitute the dark matter, and more general axions, which, under certain\nconditions, might play the role of inflatons, implementing {\\it natural\ninflation}. The latter are the actors in (generalized) hybrid inflation. They\nrather naturally yield large field inflation, even mimicking chaotic inflation\nfor suitable ranges of parameters.\n", "  Highly polarized components of pulse profiles are investigated by analyzing\nobservational data and simulating the emission processes. The highly polarized\ncomponents appear at the leading or trailing part of a pulse profile, which\npreferably have a flat spectrum and a flat polarization angle curve compared\nwith the low polarized components. By considering the emission processes and\npropagation effects, we simulate the distributions of wave modes and fractional\nlinear polarization within the entire pulsar emission beam. We show that the\nhighly polarized components can appear at the leading, central, and/or trailing\nparts of pulse profiles in the models, depending on pulsar geometry. The\ndepolarization is caused by orthogonal modes or scattering. When a sight line\ncuts across pulsar emission beam with a small impact angle, the detected highly\npolarized component will be of the O mode, and have a flat polarization angle\ncurve and/or a flat spectrum as observed. Otherwise, the highly polarized\ncomponent will be of the X mode and have a steep polarization angle curve.\n", "  This paper proposes a conditional Curie-Weiss model as a model for opinion\nformation in a society polarized along two opinions, say opinions 1 and 2. The\nmodel comes with interaction strength $\\beta>0$ and bais $h$. Here the\npopulation in question is divided into three main groups, namely: Group one\nconsisting of individuals who have decided on opinion 1. Let the proportion of\nthis group be given by $s$. Group two consisting of individauls who have chosen\nopinion 2. Let $r$ be their proportion.\n  Group three consisting of individuals who are yet to decide and they will\ndecide based on their environmental conditions. Let $1-s-r$ be the proportion\nof this group. We show that the specific magnetization of the associated\nconditional Curie-Weiss model has a first order phase transition (discontinuous\njump in specific magnetization) at $\\beta^*=\\left(1-s-r\\right)^{-1}$. It is\nalso shown that not all the discontinuous jumps in magnetization will result in\nphase change. We point out how an extention of this model could serve as a\nrandom field Curie-Weiss model where the random field distribution has\nnonvanishing mean.\n", "  The thesis contains theoretical study of number of systems in low dimension,\nwhich are related to quantum Ising model. The main results are emergence of\nMajorana fermions in condensed matter system. We discuss an array of cavity-QED\nsystem, describing atom-photon (spin-boson) interacting problem, namely Rabi\nlattice model, and calculated its phase diagram. More importantly we showed\nthat in any dimension, the system has Ising dynamics in strong atom-photon\ncoupling limit. For 1D, a special relation between end-to-end spin-spin\ncorrelation is presented, which is very much different form the bulk spin-spin\ncorrelation. The entanglement between cavities is calculated and shown to have\nmaximum value at the phase transition point. Other problems we studied were the\nfrustrated quantum Ising model and its phase diagram as well as existence of\nMajorana like edge modes in different phases of the model. The fermionic\nversion of the frustrated quantum Ising problem is also presented. On a\ndifferent but related note, we present some beautiful results on Falicov\nKimball (FK) model, a fermionic model similar to Hubbard model, on a square\nlattice. Using a canonical representation for electrons (invented by Brijesh\nKumar), the FK model is mapped to classical Ising model (at infinite Hubbard\ninteraction limit) on 2D lattice. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulation\nto study magnetization as a function of Hubbard interaction and also as a\nfunction of temperature. The motivation was to study (quantum) charge\nfluctuation (thus, quantum fluctuation of top of classical Ising\nthermodynamics) due to finite Hubbard interaction term.\n  We also devote a chapter for basic numerical techniques, such as Density\nmatrix Renormalization Group method, Exact diagonalization for spin system and\nclassical Monte Carlo simulation (for classical 2D Ising model), which we have\nused in this thesis.\n", "  Electric field measurement in plasmas permits quantitative comparison between\nthe experiment and the simulation in this study. An electro-optic (EO) sensor\nbased on Pockels effect is demonstrated to measure wave electric fields in the\nlaboratory magnetosphere of the RT-1 device with high frequency heating\nsources. This system gives the merits that electric field measurements can\ndetect electrostatic waves separated clearly from wave magnetic fields, and\nthat the sensor head is separated electrically from strong stray fields in\ncircumference. The electromagnetic waves are excited at the double loop antenna\nfor ion heating in electron cyclotron heated plasmas. In the air, the measured\nwave electric fields are in good absolute agreement with those predicted by the\nTASK/WF2 code. In inhomogeneous plasmas, the wave electric fields in the\nperipheral region are enhanced compared with the simulated electric fields. The\npotential oscillation of the antenna is one of the possible reason to explain\nthe experimental results qualitatively.\n", "  The three-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger equation with a position-dependent\n(effective) mass is studied in the framework of Supersymmetrical (SUSY) Quantum\nMechanics. The general solution of SUSY intertwining relations with first order\nsupercharges is obtained without any preliminary constraints. Several forms of\ncoefficient functions of the supercharges are investigated and analytical\nexpressions for the mass function and partner potentials are found. As usual\nfor SUSY Quantum Mechanics with nonsingular superpotentials, the spectra of\nintertwined Hamiltonians coincide up to zero modes of supercharges, and the\ncorresponding wave functions are connected by intertwining relations. All\nmodels are partially integrable by construction: each of them has at least one\nsecond order symmetry operator.\n", "  In order to facilitate an intuitive understanding of classical physics\nconcepts we have developed Potential Penguin - a game where players manipulate\nthe landscape around a sliding penguin in order to control its movement. The\nlearning goal of Potential Penguin is to familiarize players with kinetic\nenergy and potential energy - the energies associated with movement and\nposition in the landscape respectively. The game levels introduce the concepts\none by one, as players are tasked with sliding the penguin through a landscape\ntowards a specific location, while keeping the velocity under control. When the\nplayer manipulates the landscape, the potential energy of the penguin is\nchanged, which determines the penguin's movement. To build a strong connection\nbetween theory and game the analytical expressions for kinetic and potential\nenergy are displayed during play with font sizes continually growing and\nshrinking according to changes in each energy type. With Potential Penguin we\nhope to study whether visualizing the amount of kinetic and potential energy\nthrough visible mathematical expressions generates a connection between the\nintuitive actions taken in the game and the underlying physics concepts. The\nknowledge about kinetic and potential energy gained with Potential Penguin can\nalso be used to understand most of the physics behind the citizen science game\nQuantum Moves, which has the goal of building a working quantum computer. The\ntwo games share the principle of the core interaction - manipulating the\npotential-energy landscape. We aim to investigate whether a proficiency and\nunderstanding of Potential Penguin predicts a better performance in Quantum\nMoves and a deeper understanding of the quantum physics behind that game.\n", "  A fine control of the variation of the refractive index as a function of\nstructural damage is essential in the fabrication of diamond-based optical and\nphotonic devices. We report here about the variation of the real part of the\nrefractive index at lambda=632.8 nm in high quality single crystal diamond\ndamaged with 2 and 3 MeV protons at low-medium fluences (10^13 - 10^17 ions\ncm^-2). After implanting the samples in 125x125 um^2 areas with a raster\nscanning ion microbeam, the variation of optical thickness of the implanted\nregions was measured with laser interferometric microscopy. The results were\nanalyzed with a model based on the specific damage profile. The technique\nallows the direct fabrication of optical structures in bulk diamond based on\nthe localized variation of the refractive index, which will be explored in\nfuture works.\n", "  We obtain stationary measures for the one-dimensional three-state Grover walk\nwith one defect by solving the corresponding eigenvalue problem. We clarify a\nrelation between stationary and limit measures of the walk.\n", "  Comment [arXiv:cond-mat.stat.mech., 1602.02087v1 (2016)] has raised questions\nclaiming that the nonlocal model Hamiltonian presented in [Phys. Rev. E 92,\n012123 (2015)] is equivalent to the standard (short-ranged) \\Phi^4 theory.\nThese claims are based on a low momentum expansion of the interaction vertex\nthat cannot be applied to the vertex factors containing both low and high\nmomenta inside the loop-integrals. Elaborating upon the important steps of the\nmomentum shell decimation scheme, employed in the renormalization-group\ncalculation, we explicitly show the interplay of internal (high) and external\n(low) momenta determining the loop integrals for self-energy and vertex\nfunctions giving rise to corrections (to the bare parameters) different from\nthose of the standard (short-ranged) \\Phi^4 theory. Employing explicit\nmathematical arguments, we show that this difference persists when the range of\ninteraction is assumed to be long (short) ranged with respect to the lattice\nconstant (correlation-length), yielding the critical exponents as given in the\noriginal paper.\n", "  In the present work we report about the investigation of the conduction\nmechanism of sp2 carbon micro-channels buried in single crystal diamond. The\nstructures are fabricated with a novel technique which employs a MeV focused\nion-beam to damage diamond in conjunction with variable thickness masks. This\nprocess changes significantly the structural proprieties of the target\nmaterial, because the ion nuclear energy loss induces carbon conversion from\nsp3 to sp2 state mainly at the end of range of the ions (few micrometers).\nFurthermore, placing a mask with increasing thickness on the sample it is\npossible to modulate the channels depth at their endpoints, allowing their\nelectrical connection with the surface. A single-crystal HPHT diamond sample\nwas implanted with 1.8 MeV He+ ions at room temperature, the implantation\nfluence was set in the range 2.1x10^16 - 6.3x10^17 ions cm^-2, determining the\nformation of buried micro-channels at 3 um. After deposition of metallic\ncontacts at the channels' endpoints, the electrical characterization was\nperformed measuring the I-V curves at variable temperatures in the 80-690 K\nrange. The Variable Range Hopping model was used to fit the experimental data\nin the ohmic regime, allowing the estimation of characteristic parameters such\nas the density of localized states at the Fermi level. A value of 5.5x10^17\nstates cm-3 eV-1 was obtained, in satisfactory agreement with values previously\nreported in literature. The power-law dependence between current and voltage is\nconsistent with the space charge limited mechanism at moderate electric fields.\n", "  Lapis Lazuli is one of the oldest precious stone, being used for glyptic as\nearly as 7000 years ago: jewels, amulets, seals and inlays are examples of\nobjects produced using this material. Only few sources of Lapis Lazuli exist in\nthe world due to the low probability of geological conditions in which it can\nform, so that the possibility to associate the raw material to man-made objects\nhelps to reconstruct trade routes. Since art objects produced using Lapis\nLazuli are valuable, only non-destructive investigations can be carried out to\nidentify the provenance of the raw materials. Ionoluminescence (IL) is a good\ncandidate for this task. Similarly to cathodoluminescence (CL), IL consists in\nthe collection of luminescence spectra induced by MeV ion (usually protons)\nirradiation. The main advantage of IL consists in the possibility of working in\nair while measuring simultaneously the composition of major and trace element\nby means of complementary Ion Beam Analysis techniques like PIXE or PIGE\n(Particle Induce X-ray or Gamma-ray Emission). In the present work a systematic\nstudy of the luminescence properties of Lapis Lazuli under charged particles\nirradiation is reported. In a first phase a multi-technique approach was\nadopted (CL, SEM with microanalysis, micro-Raman) to characterise luminescent\nminerals. This characterisation was propaedeutic for IL/PIXE/PIGE measurements\ncarried out on significant areas selected on the basis of results obtained\npreviously. Criteria to identify provenance of Lapis Lazuli from four of the\nmain sources (Afghanistan, Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, Chile and Siberia)\nwere proposed.\n", "  We study the formation of the directed flow of hadrons in nuclear collisions\nat energies between AGS and SPS in Monte Carlo cascade model. The slope of the\nproton flow at midrapidity tends to zero (softening) with increasing impact\nparameter of the collision. For very peripheral topologies this slope becomes\nnegative (antiflow). The effect is caused by rescattering of hadrons in\nremnants of the colliding nuclei. Since the softening of the proton flow can be\nmisinterpreted as indication of the presence of quark-gluon plasma, we propose\nseveral measurements at NICA facility which can help one to distinguish between\nthe cases with and without the plasma formation.\n", "  We report on a novel method for the fabrication of three-dimensional buried\ngraphitic micropaths in single crystal diamond with the employment of focused\nMeV ions. The use of implantation masks with graded thickness at the\nsub-micrometer scale allows the formation of conductive channels which are\nembedded in the insulating matrix at controllable depths. In particular, the\nmodulation of the channels depth at their endpoints allows the surface\ncontacting of the channel terminations with no need of further fabrication\nstages. In the present work we describe the sample masking, which includes the\ndeposition of semi spherical gold contacts on the sample surface, followed by\nMeV ion implantation. Because of the significant difference between the\ndensities of pristine and amorphous or graphitized diamond, the formation of\nburied channels has a relevant mechanical effect on the diamond structure,\ncausing localized surface swelling, which has been measured both with\ninterferometric profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The electrical\nproperties of the buried channels are then measured with a two point probe\nstation: clear evidence is given that only the terminal points of the channels\nare electrically connected with the surface, while the rest of the channels\nextends below the surface. IV measurements are employed also to qualitatively\ninvestigate the electrical properties of the channels as a function of\nimplantation fluence and annealing.\n", "  In this paper we perform the detailed numerical analysis of remagnetization\nprocesses in nanocomposite magnetic materials consisting of magnetically hard\ngrains (i.e. grains made of a material with a high magnetocrystalline\nanisotropy) embedded into a magnetically soft phase. Such materials are widely\nused for the production of permanent magnets, because they combine the high\nremanence with the large coercivity. We perform simulations of nanocomposites\nwith Sr-ferrite as the hard phase and Fe or Ni as the soft phase, concentrating\nour efforts on analyzing the effects of ({\\it i}) the imperfect intergrain\nexchange and ({\\it ii}) the non-spherical shape of hard grains. We demonstrate\nthat - in contrast to the common belief - the maximal energy product is\nachieved not for systems with the perfect intergrain exchange, but for\nmaterials where this exchange is substantially weakened. We also show that the\nmain parameters of the hysteresis loop - remanence, coercivity and the energy\nproduct - exhibit non-trivial dependencies on the shape of hard grains, and\nprovide detailed explanations for our results. Simulation predictions obtained\nin this work open new ways for the optimization of materials for permanent\nmagnets.\n", "  The work was aimed to generate random laser emissions simultaneously at two\nwavelengths in a weakly scattering system containing mixture of binary dyes,\nrhodamine-B (Rh-B) and oxazine-170 (O-170) dispersed with ZnO nano-particles\nserved as scattering centres. Random lasing performances for individual Rh-B\ndye were extensively studied for varying small signal gain/scatterer density\nand found lasing threshold significantly depend upon number density of\ndispersed nano-particles. In spite of inefficient pumping, we demonstrated\npossibility of random lasing in O-170 dye solution on account of resonance\nenergy transfer from Rh-B dye served as donor. At optimum concentrations of\nfluorophores and scatterer in dye mixture solution, incoherent random lasing\nwas effectively attained simultaneously at two wavelengths centered 90 nm\napart. Dual-emission intensities, lasing thresholds and rate of amplifications\nwere found to be equivalent for both donor and acceptor in dye mixture\nsolution.\n", "  We present a survey of some recent results concerning the location and the\nWeyl formula for the complex eigenvalues of two non self-adjoint operators. We\nstudy the eigenvalues of the generator $G$ of the contraction semigroup\n$e^{tG}, \\: t \\geq 0,$ related to the wave equation in an unbounded domain\n$\\Omega$ with dissipative boundary conditions on $\\partial \\Omega$. Also one\nexamines the interior transmission eigenvalues (ITE) in a bounded domain $K$\nobtaining a Weyl formula with remainder for the counting function $N(r)$ of\ncomplex (ITE). The analysis is based on a semi-classical approach.\n", "  In this paper we describe multigraded generalizations of some constructions\nuseful for mathematical understanding of gauge theories: we perform a\nnear-at-hand generalization of the Aleksandrov--Kontsevich--Schwarz--Zaboronsky\nprocedure, we also extend the formalism of $Q$-bundles introduced first by A.\nKotov and T. Strobl. We compare these approaches studying some supersymmetric\nsigma models important in theoretical physics.\n", "  The nucleotides guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine pentaphosphate\n(pppGpp) bind to target proteins to promote bacterial survival (Corrigan et al.\n2016). Thus, the binding of the nucleotides to RsgA, a GTPase, inhibits the\nhydrolysis of GTP. The dose response, taken to be curvilinear with respect to\nthe logarithm of the inhibitor concentration, is instead much better (P<0.001\nwhen the 6 experiments are combined) represented as multiphasic, with high to\nexceedingly high absolute r values for the straight lines, and with transitions\nin the form of non-contiguities (jumps). Profiles for the binding of\nradiolabeled nucleotides to HprT and Gmk, GTP synthesis enzymes, were,\nsimilarly, taken to be curvilinear with respect to the logarithm of the protein\nconcentration. However, the profiles are again much better represented as\nmultiphasic than as curvilinear (the P values range from 0.047 to <0.001 for\neach of the 8 experiments for binding of ppGpp and pppGpp to HprT). The binding\nof GTP to HprT and the binding of the three nucleotides to Gmk are also poorly\nrepresented by curvilinear profiles, but well represented by multiphasic\nprofiles (straight and, in part, parallel lines).\n", "  Mobile devices have become an inseparable part of our everyday life. They are\nused to transmit an ever-increasing amount of sensitive health, financial and\npersonal information. This exposes us to the growing scale and sophistication\nof cyber-attacks. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) can provide unconditional and\nfuture-proof data security but implementing it for handheld mobile devices\ncomes with specific challenges. To establish security, secret keys of\nsufficient length need to be transmitted during the time of a handheld\ntransaction (~1s) despite device misalignment, ambient light and user's\ninevitable hand movements. Transmitters and receivers should ideally be compact\nand low-cost, while avoiding security loopholes. Here we demonstrate the first\nQKD transmission from a handheld transmitter with a key-rate large enough to\novercome finite key effects. Using dynamic beam-steering,\nreference-frame-independent encoding and fast indistinguishable pulse\ngeneration, we obtain a secret key rate above 30kb/s over a distance of 0.5m\nunder ambient light conditions.\n", "  Catalytically active enzymes have recently been observed to exhibit enhanced\ndiffusion. In a recent work [C. Riedel et al., Nature 517, 227 (2015)], it has\nbeen suggested that this phenomenon is correlated with the degree of\nexothermicity of the reaction, and a mechanism was proposed to explain the\nphenomenon based on channeling the released heat into the center of mass\nkinetic energy of the enzyme. I addressed this question by comparing four\ndifferent mechanisms, and concluded that collective heating is the strongest\ncandidate out of those four to explain the phenomenon, and in particular,\nseveral orders of magnitude stronger than the mechanism proposed by Riedel et\nal. In a recent preprint (arXiv:1608.05433), K. Tsekouras, C. Riedel, R.\nGabizon, S. Marqusee, S. Presse, and C. Bustamante present a comment on my\npaper [R. Golestanian, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 108102 (2015); arXiv:1508.03219],\nwhich I address here in this reply.\n", "  After introducing Schr\\\"odinger equation within position- dependent mass\nformalism, a quasi-oscillator has been considered. Eigen functions and energy\nspectra have been obtained analytical. Then thermodynamic properties,\ninformation entropy and uncertainty in coordinate and momentum corresponding\nthe considered system have calculated as well as some depicted.\n", "  We deliver a lattice study of $\\rho$ resonance parameters with p-wave\n$\\pi\\pi$ scattering phases, which are extracted by finite-size methods at one\ncenter-of-mass frame and four moving frames for six MILC lattice ensembles with\npion masses ranging from $346$ to $ 176$ MeV. The effective range formula is\napplied to describe the scattering phases as a function of the energy covering\nthe resonance region, this allows us to extract $\\rho$ resonance parameters and\nto investigate the quark-mass dependence. Lattice studies with three flavors of\nthe Asqtad-improved staggered fermions enable us to use the moving-wall source\ntechnique on large lattice spatial dimensions ($L=64$) and small light $u/d$\nquarks. Numerical computations are carried out at two lattice spacings, $a\n\\approx 0.12$ and $0.09$ fm.\n", "  We demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating light-waveguiding\nmicrostructures in bulk single-crystal diamond by means of direct ion\nimplantation with a scanning microbeam, resulting in the modulation of the\nrefractive index of the ion-beam damaged crystal. Direct evidence of\nwaveguiding through such buried microchannels is obtained with a phase-shift\nmicro-interferometric method allowing the study of the multi-modal structure of\nthe propagating electromagnetic field. The possibility of defining optical and\nphotonic structures by direct ion writing opens a range of new possibilities in\nthe design of quantum-optical devices in bulk single crystal diamond.\n", "  In this thesis, two different optical management techniques for organics\nbased solar cells are explored. The first part is focused on the development of\na textured rear reflector for OPVs. The use of textured reflector (TR)\nfacilitates an increase in the optical path length along with light trapping\nwithin the active layer. TR was fabricated through a relatively simpler\ntechnique by depositing metal films over a microlens array (MLA). Zinc oxide\nnanoparticles were used to minimize the shadowing effect. Using TR,\nenhancements in short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiencies\nup to 10-25% were demonstrated for a polymer based organic solar cell. The\nsecond part is focused on improving the effectiveness of MLA incorporation in\nOPVs. The increase in path length achieved using MLA can be improved by\nincreasing the refractive index of MLA and incorporating MLA directly on the\ntransparent electrode instead of glass substrate. This approach could avoid the\noptical losses occurring at the interface between MLA and glass substrate and\nincrease the net path length of light within the active layer. Initial\nexperimental results are discussed to understand the potential of this\napproach. Approximately, ~15% enhancement in short-circuit current density was\nachieved by using MLA directly on the transparent electrode in ITO-free\ndevices.\n", "  In this work, we present new experimental data on mass distribution of\nfission fragments from $^{241}$Am proton-induced fission at $660$ MeV measured\nat the LNR Phasotron (JINR). The systematic analysis of several measured\nfragment mass distributions from different fission reactions available in the\nliterature is also presented. The proton-induced fission of $^{241}$Am,\n$^{237}$Np and $^{238}$U at 26.5, 62.9 and 660 MeV was studied. The\nproton-induced fission of $^{232}$Th was studied at 26.5, 62.9 and 190 MeV. The\nfission of $^{208}$Pb also by a proton was investigated at 190, 500 and 1000\nMeV. The fission of $^{197}$Au was studied for 190 and 800 MeV protons.\nBremsstrahlung reactions with maximum photon energies of 50 and 3500 MeV were\nstudied for $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U. The framework of the Random Neck Rupture\nModel was applied in the analysis. The roles of the neutron excess and of the\nso called fissility parameter were also investigated.\n", "  We consider the problem of locally describing tubular geometry around a\nsubmanifold embedded in a (pseudo)Riemannian manifold in its general form.\nGiven the geometry of ambient space in an arbitrary coordinate system and\nequations determining the submanifold in the same system, we compute the\ntubular expansion coefficients in terms of this {\\it a priori data}. This is\ndone by using an indirect method that crucially applies the tubular expansion\ntheorem for vielbein previously derived. With an explicit construction\ninvolving the relevant coordinate and non-coordinate frames we verify\nconsistency of the whole method up to quadratic order in vielbein expansion.\nFurthermore, we perform certain (long and tedious) higher order computation\nwhich verifies the first non-trivial spin connection term in the expansion for\nthe first time. Earlier a similar method was used to compute tubular geometry\nin loop space. We explain this work in the light of our general construction.\n", "  Chemical and morphological features of spores and pollens have been linked to\nchanges in solar ultraviolet radiation (specifically UVB, 280-315 nm) at\nEarth's surface. Variation in UVB exposure as inferred from these features has\nbeen suggested as a proxy for paleoaltitude. While UVB irradiance does increase\nwith altitude above sea level, a number of other factors affect the irradiance\nat any given place and time. In this modeling study we use the TUV atmospheric\nradiative transfer model to investigate dependence of surface-level UVB\nirradiance and relative biological impact on a number of constituents in\nEarth's atmosphere that are variable over long and short time periods. We\nconsider changes in O3 column density, and SO2 and sulfate aerosols due to\nperiods of volcanic activity, including that associated with the formation of\nthe Siberian Traps. We find that UVB irradiance may be highly variable under\nvolcanic conditions and variations in several of these atmospheric constituents\ncan easily mimic or overwhelm changes in UVB irradiance due to changes in\naltitude. On the other hand, we find that relative change with altitude is not\nvery sensitive to different sets of atmospheric conditions. Any paleoaltitude\nproxy based on UVB exposure requires confidence that the samples under\ncomparison were located at roughly the same latitude, under very similar O3 and\nSO2 columns, with similar atmospheric aerosol conditions. In general, accurate\nestimates of the surface-level UVB exposure at any time and location require\ndetailed radiative transfer modeling taking into account a number of\natmospheric factors; this result is important for paleoaltitude proxies as well\nas attempts to reconstruct the UV environment through geologic time and to tie\nextinctions, such as the end-Permian mass extinction, to UVB irradiance\nchanges.\n", "  After a brief introduction to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, some of\nits important features in two space dimensions are reviewed. A comprehensive\nstudy of the various phases observed numerically in large systems over the\nwhole parameter space is then presented. The nature of the transitions between\nthese phases is investigated and some theoretical problems linked to the phase\ndiagram are discussed.\n", "  By using a weak measurement technique, we investigated the interplay between\nthe angular and lateral Goos-H\u007faenchen shift of a focused He-Ne laser beam for\nincidence near the critical angle. We verified that this interplay dramatically\naffects the composite Goos-H\u007faenchen shift of the propagated beam. The\nexperimental results confirm theoretical predictions that recently appeared in\nthe literature.\n", "  Power Grids and other delivery networks has been attracted some attention by\nthe network literature last decades. Despite the Power Grids dynamics has been\ncontrolled by computer systems and human operators, the static features of this\ntype of network can be studied and analyzed. The topology of the Brazilian\nPower Grid (BPG) was studied in this work. We obtained the spatial structure of\nthe BPG from the ONS (electric systems national operator), consisting of\nhigh-voltage transmission lines, generating stations and substations. The local\nlow-voltage substations and local power delivery as well the dynamic features\nof the network were neglected. We analyze the complex network of the BPG and\nidentify the main topological information, such as the mean degree, the degree\ndistribution, the network size and the clustering coefficient to caracterize\nthe complex network. We also detected the critical locations on the network\nand, therefore, the more susceptible points to lead to a cascading failure and\neven to a blackouts. Surprisely, due to the characteristic of the topology and\nphysical structure of the network, we show that the BPG is resilient against\nrandom failures, since the random removal of links does not affect\nsignificantly the size of the largest cluster. We observe that when a fraction\nof the links are randomly removed, the network may disintegrates into smaller\nand disconnected parts, however, the power grid largest component remains\nconnected. We believe that the even a static study of the network topology can\nhelp to identify the critical situations and also prevent failures and possible\nblackouts on the network.\n", "  Physical conditions inside a supernova remnant can vary significantly between\ndifferent positions. However, typical observational data are integrated data or\ncontemplate specific portions of the remnant. We study the spatial variation in\nthe physical properties of the N\\,49 supernova remnant based on a spectroscopic\nmapping of the whole nebula. Long-slit spectra were obtained with the slit\n($\\sim4\\arcmin \\times 1.03\\arcsec$) aligned along the east-west direction from\n29 different positions spaced by $2\\arcsec$ in declination. A total of 3248 1D\nspectra were extracted from sections of $2\\arcsec$ of the 2D spectra. More than\n60 emission lines in the range 3550\\,\\AA{} to 8920\\,\\AA{} were measured in\nthese spectra. Maps of the fluxes and of intensity ratios of these emission\nlines were built with a spatial resolution of $2\\arcsec \\times 2\\arcsec$. An\nelectron density map has been obtained using the [S\\,{\\sc\nii}]\\,$\\lambda6716/\\lambda6731$ line ratio. Values vary from\n$\\sim$500\\,cm$^{-3}$ at the northeast region to more than 3500 cm$^{-3}$ at the\nsoutheast border. We calculated electron temperature using line ratio sensors\nfor the ions S$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, O$^{+}$, and N$^{+}$. Values are about\n3.6$\\times10^{4}$\\,K for the O$^{++}$ sensor and about 1.1$\\times10^{4}$\\,K for\nother sensors. The H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratio map presents a ring structure with\nhigher values that may result from collisional excitation of hydrogen. We\ndetected an area with high values of [N\\,{\\sc ii}]\\,$\\lambda6583$/H$\\alpha$\nextending from the remnant center to its northeastern border, that can be\nindicating an overabundance of nitrogen in the area due to contamination by the\nprogenitor star. We found a radial dependence in many line intensity ratio\nmaps. We observed an increase toward the remnant borders of the intensity ratio\nof any two lines in which the numerator comes before in a sequence of lines.\n", "  Broadly speaking, this thesis is about nonlinear optics, quantum mechanics,\nand computing. More specifically, it covers four main topics: Coherent LQG\nControl, Free-Carrier Oscillations, Optical Ising Machines and Pulsed OPO\nDynamics. Tying them all together is a theory of open quantum systems called\nthe SLH model, which I introduce in Chapters 1-2. The SLH model is a general\nframework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is\nthe basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG\ncontrol is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent\nfeedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear\nquadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's\nsimultaneous utilization of both light quadratures. Semiclassical\ntruncated-Wigner techniques for quantum-optical networks are discussed in\nChapter 5, leading to a thorough discussion of quantum noise in systems with\nfree-carrier nonlinearities (Chapter 6), comparison to the Kerr nonlinearity,\nand potential applications for analog computing based on limit cycles and\namplification (Chapters 7-8). Ising machines based on optical parametric\noscillators (OPOs) are discussed in Chapters 9-10, the former focusing on large\n1D and 2D networks of OPOs, and the latter on the dynamics of a single OPO in\nthe ultrafast, synchronously-pumped regime. Optical properties and design\nconsiderations for silicon photonic waveguides are are treated in Chapter 11.\n", "  Measurements of the degradation in performance of 30 cm long CsI(Tl)\nscintillation crystals exposed to 1 MeV photon doses of 2, 10, 35, 100 and 1000\nGy are presented. The light yield, light yield longitudinal non-uniformity,\nscintillation decay times, energy resolution and timing resolution of a set of\nspare crystals from the BABAR and Belle experiments are studied as a function\nof these doses. In addition, a model that describes the plateau observed in the\nlight output loss as a function of dose in terms of increase in concentrations\nof absorption centres with irradiation is presented.\n", "  Grades provide students with their primary performance feedback: signals\nwhich affect academic choices. Variations in grading practice among courses\nimpose grade penalties (and bonuses) on students who take them. These grade\npenalties are sometimes gendered. Using extensive data from the University of\nMichigan, we report on patterns of grade penalty and gendered performance\ndifference across 116 large courses. We find that significant gendered\nperformance differences are ubiquitous in large introductory STEM lecture\ncourses. They are largely absent in both STEM labs and in lecture courses in\nother disciplines. Exploring the features of these courses, we hypothesize that\nevaluation methods used in STEM lecture courses interact with stereotype threat\nto create these gendered performance differences.\n", "  Di-hadronic molecules such as di-meson, meson-baryon and di-baryon states are\nstudied in the relativistic confinement model. We have computed the binding\nenergy of the di-hadronic systems like $K-N$, $\\Pi-N$, $\\rho-N$ etc., as\npenta-quark states, 2$\\pi$, $\\rho-\\rho$, $K-K^*$, $K^*-K^*$, $D-D^*$ etc. as\ntetra-quark states and $N-N$, $N-\\Delta$, $\\Delta-\\Delta$ etc. as di-baryonic\nstates using a molecular interaction provided by asymptotic expression of the\nconfined gluon exchange potential. We find the lowest penta-quark state lies in\nthe energy range of 1.180 - 2.247 GeV as predicted by other theoretical models.\nThe exotic states such as $f0 (0.982)$, $h1 (1.170)$, $f0 (1.70)$, $f2\n(1.565)$, $f2 (1.95)$, $\\psi(4.040)$ etc. are identified as the di-mesonic\nhadron molecules. The low-lying di-baryon molecular states found to be in the\nrange of 1.990-2.907 GeV with their binding energies lying between 112-120 MeV.\n", "  In this paper we continue previous work on counting open string states\nbetween D-branes by considering open strings between D-branes with nonzero\nHiggs vevs, and in particular, nilpotent Higgs vevs, as arise, for example,\nwhen studying D-branes in orbifolds. Ordinarily Higgs vevs can be interpreted\nas moving the D-brane, but nilpotent Higgs vevs have zero eigenvalues, and so\ntheir interpretation is more interesting -- for example, they often correspond\nto nonreduced schemes, which furnishes an important link in understanding old\nresults relating classical D-brane moduli spaces in orbifolds to Hilbert\nschemes, resolutions of quotient spaces, and the McKay correspondence. We give\na sheaf-theoretic description of D-branes with Higgs vevs, including nilpotent\nHiggs vevs, and check that description by noting that Ext groups between the\nsheaves modelling the D-branes, do in fact correctly count open string states.\nIn particular, our analysis expands the types of sheaves which admit on-shell\nphysical interpretations, which is an important step for making derived\ncategories useful for physics.\n"]}
