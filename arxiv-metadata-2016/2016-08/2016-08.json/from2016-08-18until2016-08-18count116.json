The\nself-gravity of the disc resists distortion in the inner parts. Applying this\napproach to a galactic disc with an exponential vertical profile, Saha & Jog\nshowed that warps develop beyond 4-6 disc scalelengths, which could hence be\nonly seen in HI. The real galactic discs, however, have less steep vertical\ndensity distributions that lie between a sech and an exponential profile. Here\nwe calculate the disc response for such a general sech^(2/n) density\ndistribution, and show that the warps develop from a smaller radius of 2-4 disc\nscalelengths. This naturally explains why most galaxies show stellar warps that\nstart within the optical radius. Thus a qualitatively different picture of\nubiquitous optical warps emerges for the observed less-steep density profiles.\nThe surprisingly strong dependence on the density profile is due to the fact\nthat the disc self-gravity depends crucially on its mass distribution close to\nthe mid-plane. General results for the radius of onset of warps, obtained as a\nfunction of the disc scalelength and the vertical scaleheight, are presented as\ncontour plots which can be applied to any galaxy.\n", "  The phase behaviour of amphiphilic multiblock copolymers with a large number\nof blocks in semidilute solutions is studied by lattice Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The influence on the resulting structures of the concentration,\nthe solvent quality and the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic monomers in the\nchains has been assessed explicitely. Several distinct regimes are put in\nevidence. For poorly substituted (mainly hydrophilic) copolymers formation of\nmicelles is observed, either isolated or connected by the hydrophilic moieties,\ndepending on concentration and chain length. For more highly substituted chains\nlarger tubular hydrophobic structures appear which, at higher concentration,\njoin to form extended hydrophobic cores. For both substitution ratios gelation\nis observed, but with a very different gel network structure. For the poorly\nsubstituted chains the gel consists of micelles cross-linked by hydrophilic\nblocks whereas for the highly substituted copolymers the extended hydrophobic\ncores form the gelling network. The interplay between gelation and phase\nseparation clearly appears in the phase diagram. In particular, for poorly\nsubstituted copolymers and in a narrow concentration range, we observe a\nsol-gel transition followed by an inverse gel-sol transition when increasing\nthe interaction energy. The simulation results are discussed in the context of\nthe experimentally observed phase properties of methylcellulose, a\nhydrophobically substituted polysaccharide.\n", "  This paper describes D-brane probes of theories arising in abelian gauged\nlinear sigma models (GLSMs) describing branched double covers and\nnoncommutative resolutions thereof, via nonperturbative effects rather than as\nthe critical locus of a superpotential. As these theories can be described as\nIR limits of Landau-Ginzburg models, technically this paper is an exercise in\nutilizing (sheafy) matrix factorizations. For Landau-Ginzburg models which are\nbelieved to flow in the IR to smooth branched double covers, our D-brane probes\nrecover the structure of the branched double cover (and flat nontrivial B\nfields), verifying previous results. In addition to smooth branched double\ncovers, the same class of Landau-Ginzburg models is also believed to sometimes\nflow to `noncommutative resolutions' of singular spaces. These noncommutative\nresolutions are abstract conformal field theories without a global geometric\ndescription, but D-brane probes perceive them as non-Kahler small resolutions\nof a singular Calabi-Yau. We conjecture that such non-Kahler small resolutions\nare typical in D-brane probes of such theories.\n", "  We promote geometric prequantization to higher geometry (higher stacks),\nwhere a prequantization is given by a higher principal connection (a higher\ngerbe with connection). We show fairly generally how there is canonically a\ntower of higher gauge groupoids and Courant groupoids assigned to a higher\nprequantization, and establish the corresponding Atiyah sequence as an\nintegrated Kostant-Souriau infinity-group extension of higher Hamiltonian\nsymplectomorphisms by higher quantomorphisms. We also exhibit the\ninfinity-group cocycle which classifies this extension and discuss how its\nrestrictions along Hamiltonian infinity-actions yield higher Heisenberg\ncocycles. In the special case of higher differential geometry over smooth\nmanifolds we find the L-infinity-algebra extension of Hamiltonian vector fields\n-- which is the higher Poisson bracket of local observables -- and show that it\nis equivalent to the construction proposed by the second author in n-plectic\ngeometry. Finally we indicate a list of examples of applications of higher\nprequantization in the extended geometric quantization of local quantum field\ntheories and specifically in string geometry.\n", "  In analogy with the physical concept of a massless D-brane, we define a\nnotion of \"Q-masslessness\" for objects in the derived category. This is defined\nin terms of monodromy around singularities in the stringy Kahler moduli space\nand is relatively easy to study using spherical functors. We consider several\nexamples in which del Pezzo surfaces and other rational surfaces in Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds are contracted. For precisely the del Pezzo surfaces that can be\nwritten as hypersurfaces in weighted P3, the category of Q-massless objects is\na \"fractional Calabi-Yau\" category of graded matrix factorizations.\n", "  We provide a family of general monogamy inequalities for global quantum\ndiscord (GQD), which can be considered as an extension of the usual discord\nmonogamy inequality. It can be shown that those inequalities are satisfied\nunder the similar condition for the holding of usual monogamy relation. We find\nthat there is an intrinsic connection among them. Furthermore, we present a\ndifferent type of monogamy inequality and prove that it holds under the\ncondition that the bipartite GQDs do not increase when tracing out some\nsubsystems. We also study the residual GQD based on the second type of monogamy\ninequality. As applications of those quantities, we investigate the GQDs and\nresidual GQD in characterizing the quantum phase transition in the transverse\nfield Ising model.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional Chern insulators and time-reversal invariant\ntopological insulators and discuss the effect of perturbations breaking either\nparticle-number conservation or time-reversal symmetry. The appearance of\ntrivial mass terms is expected to cause quantum phase transitions into trivial\nphases when such a perturbation overweights the topological term. These phase\ntransitions are usually associated with a bulk-gap closing. In contrast, the\nchiral Chern insulator is unaffected by particle-number breaking perturbations.\nMoreover, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator undergoes phase transitions\ninto topologically trivial phases without bulk-gap closing in the presence of\nany of such perturbations. In certain cases, these phase transitions can be\ncircumvented and the protection restored by another U(1) symmetry, e.g. due to\nspin conservation. These findings are discussed in the context of interacting\ntopological insulators.\n", "  We give a new proof of the 'Pfaffian-Grassmannian' derived equivalence\nbetween certain pairs of non-birational Calabi-Yau threefolds. Our proof\nfollows the physical constructions of Hori and Tong, and we factor the\nequivalence into three steps by passing through some intermediate categories of\n(global) matrix factorizations. The first step is global Knoerrer periodicity,\nthe second comes from a birational map between Landau-Ginzburg B-models, and\nfor the third we develop some new techniques.\n", "  The weight generating functions associated with convolutional codes (CCs) are\nbased on state space realizations or the weight adjacency matrices (WAMs). The\nMacWilliams identity for CCs on the WAMs was first established by Gluesing-\nLuerssen and Schneider in the case of minimal encoders, and generalized by\nForney. We consider this problem in the viewpoint of constraint codes and\nobtain a simple and direct proof of this MacWilliams identity in the case of\nminimal encoders. For our purpose, we choose a different representation for the\nexact weight generating function (EWGF) of a block code, by defining it as a\nlinear combination of orthonormal vectors in Dirac bra-ket notation. This\nrepresentation provides great flexibility so that general split weight\ngenerating functions and their MacWilliams identities can be easily obtained\nfrom the MacWilliams identity for EWGFs. As a result, we also obtain the\nMacWilliams identity for the input-parity weight adjacency matrices of a\nsystematic convolutional code and its dual. Finally, paralleling the\ndevelopment of the classical case, we establish the MacWilliams identity for\nquantum convolutional codes.\n", "  We study the relationship between the behavior of global quantum correlations\nand quantum phase transitions in XY model. We find that the two kinds of phase\ntransitions in the studied model can be characterized by the features of global\nquantum discord (GQD) and the corresponding quantum correlations. We\ndemonstrate that the maximum of the sum of all the nearest neighbor bipartite\nGQDs is effective and accurate for signaling the Ising quantum phase\ntransition, in contrast, the sudden change of GQD is very suitable for\ncharacterizing another phase transition in the XY model. This may shed lights\non the study of properties of quantum correlations in different quantum phases.\n", "  Chiral symmetry breaking is ubiquitous in biological systems, from DNA to\nbacterial suspensions. A key unresolved problem is how chiral structures may\nspontaneously emerge from achiral interactions. We study a simple model of\nbacterial suspensions in three dimensions that effectively incorporates active\nmotion and hydrodynamic interactions. We perform large-scale molecular dynamics\nsimulations (up to $10^6$ particles) and describe stable (or long-lived\nmetastable) collective states that exhibit chiral organization although the\ninteractions are achiral. We elucidate under which conditions these chiral\nstates will emerge and grow to large scales. We also study a related\nequilibrium model that clarifies the role of orientational fluctuations.\n", "  We investigate the distribution property of one way discord in multipartite\nsystem by introducing the concept of polygamy deficit for one way discord. The\ndifference between one way discord and quantum discord is analogue to the\ndifference between entanglement of assistance and entanglement of formation.\nFor tripartite pure states, two kinds of polygamy deficits are presented with\nthe equivalent expressions and physical interpretations regardless of\nmeasurement. For four-partite pure states, we provide a condition which makes\none way discord polygamy being satisfied. Those results can be applicable to\nmultipartite quantum systems and are complementary to our understanding of the\nshareability of quantum correlations.\n", "  Completely positive trace preserving maps are essential for the formulation\nof the second law of thermodynamics. The dynamics of quantum systems,\ncorrelated with their environments, are in general not described by such maps.\nWe explore how this issue can be fixed by describing the classical analogue of\nthis problem. We consider correlated probability distributions, whose\nsubsequent system dynamics is ill-described by stochastic maps, and prescribe\nthe correct way to describe the dynamics. We use this prescription to discuss\nthe classical version of the second law, valid for correlated probability\ndistributions.\n", "  We initiate the study of zero-error communication via quantum channels when\nthe receiver and sender have at their disposal a noiseless feedback channel of\nunlimited quantum capacity, generalizing Shannon's zero-error communication\ntheory with instantaneous feedback.\n  We first show that this capacity is a function only of the linear span of\nChoi-Kraus operators of the channel, which generalizes the bipartite\nequivocation graph of a classical channel, and which we dub \"non-commutative\nbipartite graph\". Then we go on to show that the feedback-assisted capacity is\nnon-zero (with constant activating noiseless communication) if and only if the\nnon-commutative bipartite graph is non-trivial, and give a number of equivalent\ncharacterizations. This result involves a far-reaching extension of the\n\"conclusive exclusion\" of quantum states [Pusey/Barrett/Rudolph, Nature Phys.\n8:475-478].\n  We then present an upper bound on the feedback-assisted zero-error capacity,\nmotivated by a conjecture originally made by Shannon and proved later by\nAhlswede. We demonstrate this bound to have many good properties, including\nbeing additive and given by a minimax formula. We also prove that this quantity\nis the entanglement-assisted capacity against an adversarially chosen channel\nfrom the set of all channels with the same Choi-Kraus span, which can also be\ninterpreted as the feedback-assisted unambiguous capacity. The proof relies on\na generalization of the \"Postselection Lemma\" [Christandl/Koenig/Renner, PRL\n102:020504] that allows to reflect additional constraints, and which we believe\nto be of independent interest.\n  We illustrate our ideas with a number of examples, including\nclassical-quantum channels and Weyl diagonal channels, and close with an\nextensive discussion of open questions.\n", "  We examine the consequences of the effective field theory (EFT) of dark\nmatter-nucleon scattering for current and proposed direct detection\nexperiments. Exclusion limits on EFT coupling constants computed using the\noptimum interval method are presented for SuperCDMS Soudan, CDMS II, and LUX,\nand the necessity of combining results from multiple experiments in order to\ndetermine dark matter parameters is discussed. We demonstrate that spectral\ndifferences between the standard dark matter model and a general EFT\ninteraction can produce a bias when calculating exclusion limits and when\ndeveloping signal models for likelihood and machine learning techniques. We\nalso discuss the implications of the EFT for the next-generation (G2) direct\ndetection experiments and point out regions of complementarity in the EFT\nparameter space.\n", "  The local minimum degree of a graph is the minimum degree that can be reached\nby means of local complementation. For any n, there exist graphs of order n\nwhich have a local minimum degree at least 0.189n, or at least 0.110n when\nrestricted to bipartite graphs. Regarding the upper bound, we show that for any\ngraph of order n, its local minimum degree is at most 3n/8+o(n) and n/4+o(n)\nfor bipartite graphs, improving the known n/2 upper bound. We also prove that\nthe local minimum degree is smaller than half of the vertex cover number (up to\na logarithmic term). The local minimum degree problem is NP-Complete and hard\nto approximate. We show that this problem, even when restricted to bipartite\ngraphs, is in W[2] and FPT-equivalent to the EvenSet problem, which\nW[1]-hardness is a long standing open question. Finally, we show that the local\nminimum degree is computed by a O*(1.938^n)-algorithm, and a\nO*(1.466^n)-algorithm for the bipartite graphs.\n", "  We present the first numerical calculation of the (local) metric perturbation\nproduced by a small compact object moving on an eccentric equatorial geodesic\naround a Kerr black hole, accurate to first order in the mass ratio. The\nprocedure starts by first solving the Teukolsky equation to obtain the Weyl\nscalar $\\psi_4$ using semi-analytical methods. The metric perturbation is then\nreconstructed from $\\psi_4$ in an (outgoing) radiation gauge, adding the\nappropriate non-radiative contributions arising from the shifts in mass and\nangular momentum of the spacetime.\n  As a demonstration we calculate the generalized redshift $U$ as a function of\nthe orbital frequencies $\\Omega_r$ and $\\Omega_\\phi$ to linear order in the\nmass ratio, a gauge invariant measure of the conservative corrections to the\norbit due to self-interactions. In Schwarzschild, the results surpass the\nexisting result in the literature in accuracy, and we find new estimates for\nsome of the unknown 4PN and 5PN terms in the post-Newtonian expansion of $U$.\nIn Kerr, we provide completely novel values of $U$ for eccentric equatorial\norbits. Calculation of the full self-force will appear in a forthcoming paper.\n", "  We combine rational homotopy theory and higher Lie theory to describe the WZW\nterm in the M5-brane sigma model. We observe that this term admits a natural\ninterpretation as a twisted 7-cocycle on super-Minkowski spacetime with\ncoefficients in the rational 4-sphere. This exhibits the WZW term as an element\nin twisted cohomology, with the twist given by the cocycle of the M2-brane. We\nconsider integration of this rational situation to differential cohomology and\ndifferential cohomotopy.\n", "  Analytic continuation of numerical data obtained in imaginary time or\nfrequency has become an essential part of many branches of quantum\ncomputational physics. It is, however, an ill-conditioned procedure and thus a\nhard numerical problem. The maximum-entropy approach, based on bayesian\ninference, is the most widely used method to tackle that problem. Although the\napproach is well established and among the most reliable and efficient ones,\nuseful developments of the method and of its implementation are still possible.\nIn addition, while a few free software implementations are available, a\nwell-documented, optimized, general purpose and user-friendly software\ndedicated to that specific task is still lacking. Here we analyze all aspects\nof the implementation that are critical for accuracy and speed, and present a\nhighly optimized approach to maximum-entropy. Original algorithmic and\nconceptual contributions include (1) numerical approximations that yield a\ncomputational complexity that is almost independent of temperature and spectrum\nshape (including sharp Drude peaks in broad background for example) while\nensuring quantitative accuracy of the result whenever precision of the data is\nsufficient, (2) a robust method of choosing the entropy weight $\\alpha$ that\nfollows from a simple consistency condition of the approach and the observation\nthat information- and noise-fitting regimes can be identified clearly from the\nbehavior of $\\chi^2$ with respect to $\\alpha$, and (3) several diagnostics to\nassess the reliability of the result. Benchmarks with test spectral functions\nof different complexity and an example with an actual physical simulation are\npresented. Our implementation, which covers most typical cases for fermions,\nbosons and response functions, is available as an open source, user friendly\nsoftware.\n", "  There is ample evidence of twisted magnetic structures in the solar corona.\nThis motivates us to consider the magnetic twist as the cause of Alfven\nfrequency continuum in the coronal loops, which can support the resonant\nabsorption as a rapid damping mechanism for the observed coronal kink\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) oscillations. We model a coronal loop with a straight\ncylindrical magnetic flux tube which has constant but different densities in\nthe interior and exterior regions. The magnetic field is assumed to be constant\nand aligned with the cylinder axis everywhere except a thin layer near the\nboundary of the flux tube which has an additional small magnetic field twist.\nThen, we investigate a number of possible instabilities that may arise in our\nmodel. In the thin tube thin boundary approximation, we derive the dispersion\nrelation and solve it analytically to obtain the frequencies and damping rates\nof the fundamental (l=1) and first/second overtone (l=2,3) kink (m=1) MHD\nmodes. We conclude that the resonant absorption by the magnetic twist can\njustify the rapid damping of kink MHD waves observed in coronal loops.\nFurthermore, the magnetic twist in the inhomogeneous layer can cause deviations\nfrom P1/P2=2 and P1/P3=3 which are comparable with the observations.\n", "  NIKA is a dual-band camera operating with 315 frequency multiplexed LEKIDs\ncooled at 100 mK. NIKA is designed to observe the sky in intensity and\npolarisation at 150 and 260 GHz from the IRAM 30-m telescope. It is a\ntest-bench for the final NIKA2 camera. The incoming linear polarisation is\nmodulated at four times the mechanical rotation frequency by a warm rotating\nmulti-layer Half Wave Plate. Then, the signal is analysed by a wire grid and\nfinally absorbed by the LEKIDs. The small time constant (< 1ms ) of the LEKID\ndetectors combined with the modulation of the HWP enables the\nquasi-simultaneous measurement of the three Stokes parameters I, Q, U,\nrepresenting linear polarisation. In this paper we present results of recent\nobservational campaigns demonstrating the good performance of NIKA in detecting\npolarisation at mm wavelength.\n", "  Based on the inhomogeneous T-Q relation and the associated Bethe Ansatz\nequations obtained via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz, we construct the\nBethe-type eigenstates of the SU(2)-invariant spin-s chain with generic\nnon-diagonal boundaries by employing certain orthogonal basis of the Hilbert\nspace.\n", "  The formation of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) on metal oxide surfaces\nhave attracted considerable interest due to their diverse applications. In this\nwork, we have performed densi-ty-functional theory calculations to investigate\nthe co-adsorption of oxygen and water on ul-trathin MgO(100) films deposited on\nMo(100) substrate. We reveal that the molecular oxygen can be stepwise\ndecomposed completely with the assistance of water. Consequently, a series of\nhighly ROS including superoxide, hydroperoxide, hydroxyl and single oxygen\nadatom are formed on Mo(100) supported MgO(100) thinfilms. The reaction\nbarriers accompanied by the generation of ROS are reported, and the influence\nof the thickness of MgO(100) films is also discussed. The most promising routes\nto produce these fascinating species provide valuable information to understand\nthe importance of synergistic effect, namely the substrate, the co-adorbed\nspecies, and the film thickness, in multiphase catalyst design.\n", "  We introduce a coherence susceptibility method, based on the fact that it\nsignals quantum fluctuations, for identifying quantum phase transitions, which\nare induced by quantum fluctuations. This method requires no prior knowledge of\norder parameter, and there is no need for careful considerations concerning the\nchoice of a bipartition of the system. It can identify different types of\nquantum phase transition points exactly. At finite temperatures, where quantum\ncriticality is influenced by thermal fluctuations, our method can pinpoint the\ntemperature frame of quantum criticality, which perfectly coincides with recent\nexperiments.\n", "  We propose a guideline for exploring substrates that stabilize the monolayer\nhoneycomb structure of silicene and germanene while simultaneously preserve the\nDirac states: in addition to have a strong binding energy to the monolayer, a\nsuitable substrate should be a large-gap semiconductor with a proper\nworkfunction such that the Dirac point lies in the gap and far from the\nsubstrate states when their bands align. We illustrate our idea by performing\nfirst-principles calculations for silicene and germanene on the Al-terminated\n(0001) surface of Al2O3 . The overlaid monolayers on Al-terminated Al2O3(0001)\nretain the main structural profile of the low-buckled honeycomb structure via a\nbinding energy comparable to the one between silicene and Ag(111). Unfolded\nband structure derived from the k-projection method reveals that gapped Dirac\ncone is formed at the K point due to the structural distortion and the\ninteraction with the substrate. The gaps of 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV respectively for\nthe supported silicene and germanene suggest that they may have potential\napplications in nanoelectronics.\n", "  Previous generations of X-ray observatories revealed a group of massive\nbinaries that were relatively bright X-ray emitters. This was attributed to\nemission of shock-heated plasma in the wind-wind interaction zone located\nbetween the stars. With the advent of the current generation of X-ray\nobservatories, the phenomenon could be studied in much more detail. In this\nreview, we highlight the progress that has been achieved in our understanding\nof the phenomenon over the last 15 years, both on theoretical and observational\ngrounds. All these studies have paved the way for future investigations using\nthe next generation of X-ray satellites that will provide crucial information\non the X-ray emission formed in the innermost part of the wind-wind\ninteraction.\n", "  A subset (~ 10%) of massive stars present strong, globally ordered (mostly\ndipolar) magnetic fields. The trapping and channeling of their stellar winds in\nclosed magnetic loops leads to magnetically confined wind shocks (MCWS), with\npre-shock flow speeds that are some fraction of the wind terminal speed. These\nshocks generate hot plasma, a source of X-rays. In the last decade, several\ndevelopments took place, notably the determination of the hot plasma properties\nfor a large sample of objects using XMM-Newton and Chandra, as well as fully\nself-consistent MHD modelling and the identification of shock retreat effects\nin weak winds. Despite a few exceptions, the combination of magnetic\nconfinement, shock retreat and rotation effects seems to be able to account for\nX-ray emission in massive OB stars. Here we review these new observational and\ntheoretical aspects of this X-ray emission and envisage some perspectives for\nthe next generation of X-ray observatories.\n", "  We present a new mechanism of attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pulses\ngeneration from a relativistic laser-driven overdense plasma surfaces in the\nwavebreaking regime. Through particle-in-cell simulations and analysis, we\ndemonstrate that the observed ultrashort XUV emission for the parameters we\nconsidered is predominantly due to a strong plasma-density oscillation\nsubsequent to wavebreaking. The coupling of the strong density variation and\nthe transverse fields in the front surface layer gives rise to the transmitted\nemission with frequencies mainly around the local plasma frequency. This\nmechanism provides new insights into the scenarios of XUV generation from solid\nsurfaces and the dynamics of laser-plasma interactions.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between two kinds of ground-state local\nconvertibility and quantum phase transitions in XY model. The local operations\nand classical communications (LOCC) convertibility is examined by the\nmajorization relations and the entanglement-assisted local operations and\nclassical communications (E- LOCC) via Renyi entropy interception. In the phase\ndiagram of XY model, LOCC convertibility and ELOCC convertibility of\nground-states are presented and compared. It is shown that different phases in\nthe phase dia- gram of XY model can have different LOCC or ELOCC\nconvertibility, which can be used to detect the quantum phase transition. This\nstudy will enlighten extensive studies of quantum phase transitions from the\nperspective of local convertibility, e.g., finite-temperature phase transitions\nand other quantum many-body models.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel technique for cooling a degenerate Fermi gas in a\ncrossed-beam optical dipole trap, where high-energy atoms can be selectively\nremoved from the trap by modulating the stiffness of the trapping potential\nwith anharmonic trapping frequencies. We measure the dependence of the cooling\neffect on the frequency and amplitude of the parametric modulations. It is\nfound that the large anharmonicity along the axial trapping potential allows to\ngenerate a degenerate Fermi gas with anisotropic energy distribution, in which\nthe cloud energy in the axial direction can be reduced to the ground state\nvalue.\n", "  We review recent progress in point contact spectroscopy (PCS) to extract\nspectroscopic information out of correlated electron materials, with the\nemphasis on non-superconducting states. PCS has been used to detect bosonic\nexcitations in normal metals, where signatures (e.g. phonons) are usually less\nthan 1$\\%$ of the measured conductance. In the superconducting state, point\ncontact Andreev reflection (PCAR) has been widely used to study properties of\nthe superconducting gap in various superconductors. In the last decade, there\nhave been more and more experimental results suggesting that the point contact\nconductance could reveal new features associated with the unusual single\nelectron dynamics in non-superconducting states, shedding a new light on\nexploring the nature of the competing phases in correlated materials. We will\nsummarize the theories for point contact spectroscopy developed from different\napproaches and highlight these conceptual differences distinguishing point\ncontact spectroscopy from tunneling-based probes. Moreover, we will show how\nthe Schwinger-Kadanoff-Baym-Keldysh (SKBK) formalism together with the\nappropriate modeling of the nano-scale point contacts randomly distributed\nacross the junction leads to the conclusion that the point contact conductance\nis proportional to the {\\it effective density of states}, a physical quantity\nthat can be computed if the electron self energy is known. The experimental\ndata on iron based superconductors and heavy fermion compounds will be analyzed\nin this framework. These recent developments have extended the applicability of\npoint contact spectroscopy to correlated materials, which will help us achieve\na deeper understanding of the single electron dynamics in strongly correlated\nsystems.\n", "  The Mott insulating state of the Hubbard model at half-filling could be\ndepicted as a spin liquid of singly occupied sites with holon-doublon quantum\nfluctuations localized in pairs. In one dimension the behavior is captured by a\nfinite value of the charge parity string correlator, which fails to remain\nfinite when generalized to higher dimensions. We recover a definition of parity\nbrane correlator which may remain nonvanishing in presence of interchain\ncoupling, by assigning an appropriate fractional phase to the parity breaking\nfluctuations. In case of Hubbard ladders at half-filling, we find that the\ncharge parity brane is non-zero at any repulsive value of interaction. The spin\nparity brane instead becomes nonvanishing in the even-leg case, in\ncorrespondence to the onset of the spin gapped D-Mott phase, which is absent in\nthe odd-leg case. The behavior of the parity correlators is also analyzed by\nmeans of a numerical DMRG analysis of the one- and two-leg ladder.\n", "  This paper studies a particular class of higher order conformally invariant\ndif- ferential operators and related integral operators acting on functions\ntaking values in particular finite dimensional irreducible representations of\nthe Spin group. The differential operators can be seen as a generalization to\nhigher spin spaces of kth- powers of the Euclidean Dirac operator. To construct\nthese operators, we use the framework of higher spin theory in Clifford\nanalysis, in which irreducible represen- tations of the Spin group are realized\nas polynomial spaces satisfying a particular system of differential equations.\nAs a consequence, these operators act on functions taking values in the space\nof homogeneous harmonic or monogenic polynomials de- pending on the order.\nMoreover, we classify these operators in analogy with the quantization of\nangular momentum in quantum mechanics to unify the terminology used in studying\nhigher order higher spin conformally invariant operators: for integer and\nhalf-integer spin, these are respectively bosonic and fermionic operators.\nFundamental solutions and their conformal invariance are presented here.\n", "  Following an idea by Joyner et al. [Europhys. Lett. 107, 50004 (2014)] a\nmicrowave graph with an antiunitary symmetry T obeying T^2=-1 is realized. The\nKramers doublets expected for such systems are clearly identified and can be\nlifted by a perturbation which breaks the antiunitary symmetry. The observed\nspectral level spacings distribution of the Kramers doublets is in agreement\nwith the predictions from the Gaussian symplectic ensemble expected for chaotic\nsystems with such a symmetry.\n", "  The trigonometric su(n) spin chain with anti-periodic boundary condition\n(su(n) spin torus) is demonstrated to be Yang-Baxter integrable. Based on some\nintrinsic properties of the R-matrix, certain operator product identities of\nthe transfer matrix are derived. These identities and the asymptotic behavior\nof the transfer matrix together allow us to obtain the exact eigenvalues in\nterms of an inhomogeneous T-Q relation via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz.\n", "  Ultrafast extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources with a controllable polarization\nstate are powerful tools for investigating the structural and electronic as\nwell as the magnetic properties of materials. However, such light sources are\nstill limited to only a few free-electron laser facilities and, very recently,\nto high-order harmonic generation from noble gases. Here we propose and\nnumerically demonstrate a laser-plasma scheme to generate bright XUV pulses\nwith fully controlled polarization. In this scheme, an elliptically-polarized\nlaser pulse is obliquely incident on a plasma surface, and the reflected\nradiation contains pulse trains and isolated circularly- or\nhighly-elliptically-polarized attosecond XUV pulses. The harmonic polarization\nstate is fully controlled by the laser-plasma parameters. The mechanism can be\nexplained within the relativistically oscillating mirror model. This scheme\nopens a practical and promising route to generate bright attosecond XUV pulses\nwith desirable ellipticities in a straightforward and efficient way for a\nnumber of applications.\n", "  In the vein of the recent \"pretty strong\" converse for the quantum and\nprivate capacity of degradable quantum channels [Morgan/Winter, IEEE Trans.\nInf. Theory 60(1):317-333, 2014], we use the same techniques, in particular the\ncalculus of min-entropies, to show a pretty strong converse for the private\ncapacity of degraded classical-quantum-quantum (cqq-)wiretap channels, which\ngeneralize Wyner's model of the degraded classical wiretap channel.\n  While the result is not completely tight, leaving some gap between the region\nof error and privacy parameters for which the converse bound holds, and a\nlarger no-go region, it represents a further step towards an understanding of\nstrong converses of wiretap channels [cf. Hayashi/Tyagi/Watanabe,\narXiv:1410.0443 for the classical case].\n", "  Epsilon-Near-Zero materials exhibit a transition in the real part of the\ndielectric permittivity from positive to negative value as a function of\nwavelength. Here we study metal-dielectric layered metamaterials in the\nhomogenised regime (each layer has strongly subwavelength thickness) with zero\nreal part of the permittivity in the near-infrared region. By optically pumping\nthe metamaterial we experimentally show that close to the Epsilon-Equal-to-Zero\n(EEZ) wavelength the permittivity exhibits a marked transition from metallic\n(negative permittivity) to dielectric (positive permittivity) as a function of\nthe optical power. Remarkably, this transition is linear as a function of pump\npower and occurs on time scales of the order of the 100 fs pump pulse that need\nnot be tuned to a specific wavelength. The linearity of the permittivity\nincrease allows us to express the response of the metamaterial in terms of a\nstandard third order optical nonlinearity: this shows a clear inversion of the\nroles of the real and imaginary parts in crossing the EEZ wavelength, further\nsupporting an optically induced change in the physical behaviour of the\nmetamaterial.\n", "  Heavy elements (beyond iron) are formed in neutron capture nucleosynthesis\nprocesses. We have proposed a simple unified model to investigate the neutron\ncapture nucleosynthesis in arbitrary neutron density environment. We have also\ninvestigated what neutron density is required to reproduce the measured\nabundance of nuclei assuming equilibrium processes. We found both of these that\nthe medium neutron density has a particularly important role at neutron capture\nnucleosynthesis. About these results most of the nuclei can formed at medium\nneutron capture density environment e.g. in some kind of AGB stars. Besides\nthese observations our model is capable to use educational purpose.\n", "  Motivated by the recent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiment\nfor the electron-doped cuprates Nd_{2-x}Ce_{x}CuO_{4} with x around 0.15, we\ncompute the density-density correlation function in the t-J model on a square\nlattice by including interlayer hopping and the long-range Coulomb interaction.\nWe find that collective charge excitations are realized not inside the\nparticle-hole continuum, but above the continuum as plasmons. The plasmon mode\nhas a rather flat dispersion near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) with a typical\nexcitation energy of the order of the intralayer hopping t when the\nout-of-plane momentum qz is zero. However, when qz becomes finite, the plasmon\ndispersion changes drastically near q=(0,0), leading to a strong dispersive\nfeature with an excitation gap scaled by the interlayer hopping tz. We discuss\nthat the mode recently observed by RIXS near q=(0,0) can be associated with the\nplasmon mode with a finite qz.\n", "  In our former contribution [Ann. Phys. 360 (2015) 44], we have shown the\nsensitivity to the choice of initial conditions in the evolution of Gaussian\nwave packets via the nonlinear Riccati equation. The formalism developed in the\nprevious work is extended to effective approaches for the description of\ndissipative quantum systems. By means of simple examples we show the effects of\nthe environment on the quantum uncertainties, correlation function, quantum\nenergy contribution and tunneling currents. We prove that the environmental\nparameter $\\gamma$ is strongly related with the sensitivity to the choice of\ninitial conditions.\n", "  There are two long-range forces in the Universe, electromagnetism and\ngravity.We have found a general expression for the energy of interaction in\nthese cases alphaXhbarXc/r, where alpha is the fine structure constant and r is\nthe distance between the two particles.In the case of the electromagnetic\ninteraction we have alphaxhbarxc=e^2/4pixepsilon, where e is the gauge charge,\nwhich is the elementary electron charge. In the case of the gravitational\ninteraction alphaxhbarxc=GxM^2where M=1.85x10^(-9) kg is the gauge mass of the\nparticle.This is a giant particle. A system of like charged giant particles,\nwould be a charged superfluid. By spontaneous breaking of a gauge symmetry are\ngenerated the Higgs masive bosons.The unitary gauge assure generation of the\nneutral massive particles. The perturbation from the unitary gauge generates\ncharged massive particles. Also, the Higgs boson decays into charged and\nneutral particles.The Tesla coil is the user of the excitations of the vacuum.\n", "  This paper continues the work of our previous paper [8], where we generalize\nkth-powers of the Euclidean Dirac operator D_x to higher spin spaces in the\ncase the target space is a degree one homogeneous polynomial space. In this\npaper, we reconsider the generalizations of D_x^3 and D_x^4 to higher spin\nspaces in the case the target space is a degree k homogeneous polynomial space.\nConstructions of 3rd and 4th order conformally invariant operators in higher\nspin spaces are given; these are the 3rd order fermionic and 4th order bosonic\noperators. Fundamental solutions and intertwining operators of both operators\nare also presented here. These results can be easily generalized to cylinders\nand Hopf manifolds as in [7].\n", "  We proposed a gravitational energy momentum tensor in previous paper. By\nusing it, we evaluate an electric and a gravitational energies in and out of an\nevent horizon of a charged black hole. There is no gravitational energy in the\nevent horizon as well as Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for the pair production of top squarks,\nthe supersymmetric partners of top quarks, in final states with jets and\nmissing transverse momentum. The data sample used in this search was collected\nby the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 inverse\nfemtobarns of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\nproduced by the LHC. The search features novel background suppression and\nprediction methods, including a dedicated top quark pair reconstruction\nalgorithm. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted\nbackgrounds. Exclusion limits are set in simplified supersymmetry models with\nthe top squark decaying to jets and an undetected neutralino, either via a top\nquark or through a bottom quark and chargino. Models with the top squark\ndecaying via a top quark are excluded for top squark masses up to 755 GeV in\nthe case of neutralino masses below 200 GeV. For decays via a chargino, top\nsquark masses up to 620 GeV are excluded, depending on the masses of the\nchargino and neutralino.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the two manganese pnictides BaMn$_2$As$_2$ and\nLaMnAsO, using fully charge self-consistent density functional plus dynamical\nmean-field theory calculations. These systems have a nominally half-filled d\nshell, and as a consequence, electronic correlations are strong, placing these\ncompounds at the verge of a metal-insulator transition. Although their crystal\nstructure is composed of similar building blocks, our analysis shows that the\ntwo materials exhibit a very different effective dimensionality, LaMnAsO being\na quasi-two-dimensional material in contrast to the much more three-dimensional\nBaMn$_2$As$_2$. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed differences in\nthe N\\'eel temperature, the band gap, and the optical properties of the\nmanganese compounds under consideration can be traced back to exactly this\neffective dimensionality. Our calculations show excellent agreement with\nmeasured optical spectra.\n", "  In 2006, a novel cobalt-based superalloy was discovered [1] with mechanical\nproperties better than some conventional nickel-based superalloys. As with\nconventional superalloys, its high performance arises from the\nprecipitate-hardening effect of a coherent L1$_2$ phase, which is in two-phase\nequilibrium with the fcc matrix. Inspired by this unexpected discovery of an\nL1$_2$ ternary phase, we performed a first-principles search through 2224\nternary metallic systems for analogous precipitate-hardening phases of the form\n$X_{3}$[$A_{0.5}, B_{0.5}$], where $X$ = Ni, Co, or Fe, and [$A,B$] = Li, Be,\nMg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn Ga, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo,\nTc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Hf, Ta, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, or Tl.\nWe found 102 systems that have a smaller decomposition energy and a lower\nformation enthalpy than the Co$_{3}$(Al, W) superalloy. They have a stable\ntwo-phase equilibrium with the host matrix within the concentration range\n$0<x<1$ ($X_{3}$[$A_{x}, B_{1-x}$]) and have a relative lattice mismatch with\nthe host matrix of less than or equal to 5%. These new candidates, narrowed\nfrom 2224 systems, suggest possible experimental exploration for identifying\nnew superalloys. Of these 102 systems, 37 are new; they have no reported phase\ndiagrams in standard databases. Based on cost, experimental difficulty, and\ntoxicity, we limit these 37 to a shorter list of six promising candidates of\nimmediate interest. Our calculations are consistent with current experimental\nliterature where data exists.\n", "  A chiral matrix model applicable to QCD with 2+1 flavors is developed. This\nrequires adding a SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R x Z(3)_A nonet of scalar fields, with both\nparities, and coupling these to quarks through a Yukawa coupling, y. Treating\nthe scalar fields in mean field approximation, the effective Lagrangian is\ncomputed by integrating out quarks to one loop order. In addition to the usual\nsymmetry breaking term, linear in the current quark mass m_qk, at a nonzero\ntemperature T it is necessary to add a new term, ~ m_qk T^2. The parameters of\nthe gluon part of the matrix model are identical to that for the pure glue\ntheory without quarks. The parameters in the chiral matrix model are fixed by\nthe values, at zero temperature, of the pion decay constant and the masses of\nthe pions, kaons, eta, and eta'. The temperature for the chiral crossover at\nT_chi = 155 MeV is determined by adjusting the Yukawa coupling y. We find\nreasonable agreement with the results of numerical simulations on the lattice\nfor the pressure and related quantities. In the chiral limit, besides the\ndivergence in the chiral susceptibility there is also a milder divergence in\nthe susceptibility between the Polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter,\nwith critical exponent beta - 1. We compute derivatives with respect to a quark\nchemical potential to determine the susceptibilities for baryon number, the\nchi_2n. Especially sensitive tests are provided by chi_4 - chi_2 and by chi_6,\nwhich changes in sign about T_chi. The behavior of the susceptibilities in the\nchiral matrix model strongly suggests that as the temperature increases from\nT_chi, that the transition to deconfinement is significantly quicker than\nindicated by the measurements of the (renormalized) Polyakov loop on the\nlattice.\n", "  The practical difficulties to use graphene in microelectronics and\noptoelectronics is that the available methods to grow graphene are not easily\nintegrated in the mainstream technologies. A growth method that could overcome\nat least some of these problems is chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of graphene\ndirectly on semiconducting (Si or Ge) substrates. Here we report on the\ncomparison of the CVD and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of graphene on\nthe technologically relevant Ge(001)/Si(001) substrate from ethene (C$_2$H$_4$)\nprecursor and describe the physical properties of the films as well as we\ndiscuss the surface reaction and diffusion processes that may be responsible\nfor the observed behavior. Using nano angle resolved photoemission (nanoARPES)\ncomplemented by transport studies and Raman spectroscopy, we report the direct\nobservation of massless Dirac particles in monolayer graphene, providing a\ncomprehensive mapping of their low-hole doped Dirac electron bands. The\nmicrometric graphene flakes are oriented along two predominant directions\nrotated by $30^\\circ$ with respect to each other. The growth mode is attributed\nto the mechanism when small graphene \"molecules\" nucleate on the Ge(001)\nsurface and it is found that hydrogen plays a significant role in this process.\n", "  In this paper, we address analytically and numerically the inversion of the\nintegral transform (\\emph{cone} or \\emph{Compton} transform) that maps a\nfunction on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ to its integrals over conical surfaces. It arises in\na variety of imaging techniques, e.g. in astronomy, optical imaging, and\nhomeland security imaging, especially when the so called Compton cameras are\ninvolved.\n  Several inversion formulas are developed and implemented numerically in $3D$\n(the much simpler $2D$ case was considered in a previous publication). An\nadmissibility condition on detectors geometry is formulated, under which all\nthese inversion techniques will work.\n", "  We revisit the problem of preparing a mechanical oscillator in the vicinity\nof its quantum-mechanical ground state by means of feedback cooling based on\ncontinuous optical detection of the oscillator position. In the parameter\nregime relevant to ground state cooling, the optical back-action and\nimprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be\ncarefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local\noscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational\nmeasurement. The trade-off between accurate position measurement and minimal\ndisturbance can be understood in terms of Heisenberg's microscope and becomes\nparticularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be\nfast within the quantum coherence time of the system to be cooled. This\ncorresponds to the regime of large quantum cooperativity\n$C_{\\text{q}}\\gtrsim1$, which was achieved in recent experiments on feedback\ncooling. Our method provides a simple path to further pushing the limits of\ncurrent state-of-the-art experiments in quantum optomechanics.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations have been widely used as a tool to explore\nparticle production mechanisms in heavy-ion collisions. The mixed-event\ntechnique is generally used as a standard method to correct for\nfinite-acceptance effects. We demonstrate that event mixing only provides an\napproximate acceptance correction, and propose new methods for\nfinite-acceptance corrections. Starting from discussions about 2-dimensional\ncorrection procedures, new methods are derived for specific assumptions on the\nproperties of the signal, such as uniform signal distribution or\n$\\delta$-function-like trigger particle distribution, and suitable for\ntwo-particle correlation analyses from particles at mid-rapidity and jet-hadron\nor high $p_{\\text{T}}$-triggered hadron-hadron correlations. Per-trigger\nassociated particle yields from the mixed-event method and the new methods are\ncompared through Monte Carlo simulations containing well-defined correlation\nsignals. Significant differences are observed at large pseudorapidity\ndifferences in general and especially for asymmetric particle distribution like\nthat produced in proton--nucleus collisions. The applicability and validity of\nthe new methods are discussed in detail.\n", "  During the commissioning of the first of the two detectors of the Double\nChooz experiment, an unexpected and dominant background caused by the emission\nof light inside the optical volume has been observed. A specific study of the\nensemble of phenomena called \"Light Noise\" has been carried out in-situ, and in\nan external laboratory, in order to characterize the signals and to identify\nthe possible processes underlying the effect. Some mechanisms of instrumental\nnoise originating from the PMTs were identified and it has been found that the\nleading one arises from the light emission localized on the photomultiplier\nbase and produced by the combined effect of heat and high voltage across the\ntransparent epoxy resin covering the electric components. The correlation of\nthe rate and the amplitude of the signal with the temperature has been\nobserved. For the first detector in operation the induced background has been\nmitigated using online and offline analysis selections based on timing and\nlight pattern of the signals, while a modification of the photomultiplier\nassembly has been implemented for the second detector in order to blacken the\nPMT bases.\n", "  Hydrodynamical shocks are a manifestation of the non-linearity of the Euler\nequations and play a fundamental role in cosmological gas dynamics. In this\nwork, we identify and analyse shocks in the Illustris simulation, and contrast\nthe results with those of non-radiative runs. We show that simulations with\nmore comprehensive physical models of galaxy formation pose new challenges for\nshock finding algorithms due to radiative cooling and star-forming processes,\nprompting us to develop a number of methodology improvements. We find in\nIllustris a total shock surface area which is about 1.4 times larger at the\npresent epoch compared to non-radiative runs, and an energy dissipation rate at\nshocks which is higher by a factor of around 7. Remarkably, shocks with Mach\nnumbers above and below $\\mathcal{M}\\approx10$ contribute about equally to the\ntotal dissipation across cosmic time. This is in sharp contrast to\nnon-radiative simulations, and we demonstrate that a large part of the\ndifference arises due to strong black hole radio-mode feedback in Illustris. We\nalso provide an overview of the large diversity of shock morphologies, which\nincludes complex networks of halo-internal shocks, shocks on to cosmic sheets,\nfeedback shocks due to black holes and galactic winds, as well as ubiquitous\naccretion shocks. In high redshift systems more massive than\n$10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ we discover the existence of a double accretion\nshock pattern in haloes. They are created when gas streams along filaments\nwithout being shocked at the outer accretion shock, but then forms a second,\nroughly spherical accretion shock further inside.\n", "  We describe the creation of a long-lived spin-orbit-coupled gas of quantum\ndegenerate atoms using the most magnetic fermionic element, dysprosium.\nSpin-orbit-coupling arises from a synthetic gauge field created by the\nadiabatic following of degenerate dressed states comprised of optically coupled\ncomponents of an atomic spin. Because of dysprosium's large electronic orbital\nangular momentum and large magnetic moment, the lifetime of the gas is limited\nnot by spontaneous emission from the light-matter coupling, as for gases of\nalkali-metal atoms, but by dipolar relaxation of the spin. This relaxation is\nsuppressed at large magnetic fields due to Fermi statistics. We observe\nlifetimes up to 400 ms, which exceeds that of spin-orbit-coupled fermionic\nalkali atoms by a factor of 10-100, and is close to the value obtained from a\ntheoretical model. Elastic dipolar interactions are also observed to influence\nthe Rabi evolution of the spin, revealing an interacting fermionic system. The\nlong lifetime of this weakly interacting spin-orbit-coupled degenerate Fermi\ngas will facilitate the study of quantum many-body phenomena manifest at longer\ntimescales, with exciting implications for the exploration of exotic\ntopological quantum liquids.\n", "  I will discuss to what degree the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can be\nused to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity involving one tensor and two\nscalar fluctuations, focusing on the correlation of one $B$-mode polarization\nfluctuation with two temperature fluctuations (BTT). In the simplest models of\ninflation, the tensor-scalar-scalar primordial bispectrum is non-vanishing and\nis of the same order in slow-roll parameters as the scalar-scalar-scalar\nbispectrum. I will show that constraints from an experiment like CMB-Stage IV\nusing this observable are more than an order of magnitude better than those on\nthe same primordial coupling obtained from temperature measurements alone. I\nwill argue that $B$-mode non-Gaussianity opens up an as-yet-unexplored window\ninto the early Universe, demonstrating that significant information on\nprimordial physics remains to be harvested from CMB anisotropies. BTT presents\na measure of both primordial tensors and primordial non-Gaussianity, two of the\nmost sought after signatures of the inflationary paradigm.\n", "  Recently we have proposed a novel method to probe primordial gravitational\nwaves from upper bounds on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). When\nthe amplitude of primordial tensor perturbations generated in the early\nUniverse is fairly large, they induce substantial scalar perturbations due to\ntheir second-order effects. If these induced scalar perturbations are too large\nwhen they reenter the horizon, then PBHs are overproduced, their abundance\nexceeding observational upper limits. That is, primordial tensor perturbations\non superhorizon scales can be constrained from the absence of PBHs. In our\nrecent paper we have only shown simple estimations of these new constraints,\nand hence in this paper, we present detailed derivations, solving the Einstein\nequations for scalar perturbations induced at second order in tensor\nperturbations. We also derive an approximate formula for the probability\ndensity function of induced density perturbations, necessary to relate the\nabundance of PBHs to the primordial tensor power spectrum, assuming primordial\ntensor perturbations follow Gaussian distributions. Our new upper bounds from\nPBHs are compared with other existing bounds obtained from big bang\nnucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, LIGO/Virgo and pulsar timing\narrays.\n", "  The single-molecule conductance of a 3-ring, conjugated azomethine was\nstudied using the mechanically controlled breakjunction technique. Charge\ntransport properties are found to be comparable to vinyl-based analogues;\nfindings are supported with density functional calculations. The simple\npreparation and good transport properties make azomethine-based molecules an\nattractive class for use in polymer and single-molecule organic electronics.\n", "  Many practical systems can be described by dynamic networks, for which modern\ntechnique can measure their output signals, and accumulate extremely rich data.\nNevertheless, the network structures producing these data are often deeply\nhidden in these data. Depicting network structures by analysing the available\ndata, i.e., the inverse problems turns to be of great significant. On one hand,\ndynamics are often driven by various unknown facts, called noises. On the other\nhand, network structures of practical systems are commonly nonlinear, and\ndifferent nonlinearities can provide rich dynamic features and meaningful\nfunctions of realistic networks. So far, no method, both theoretically or\nnumerically, has been found to systematically treat the both difficulties\ntogether. Here we propose to use high-order correlation computations (HOCC) to\ntreat nonlinear dynamics; use two-time correlations to treat noise effects; and\nuse suitable basis and correlator vectors to unifiedly depict all dynamic\nnonlinearities and topological interaction links and noise statistical\nstructures. All the above theoretical frameworks are constructed in a closed\nform and numerical simulations fully verify the validity of theoretical\npredictions.\n", "  To date all self-tests for high dimensional systems are confined to\nmany-qubit states. This is due to two restrictions in the literature: the\nstandard techniques for proving self-testing results apply only to qubits, and\nthere are few suitable non-local games that are known to require high\ndimensional non-qubit states to achieve their optimal quantum value. In this\npaper we address these two problems. Specifically, we generalize the usual\nself-testing framework to q$d$its and then apply it to a generalization of the\nmagic square game, giving a self-test for two maximally entangled pairs of\nq$d$its. This self-test has two parties, perfect completeness for honest\nquantum players, and requires only a constant number of measurement settings,\nregardless of the dimension $d$.\n", "  Deviations from thermal distribution functions of produced particles in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions are discussed as indicators for\nnonequilibrium processes. The focus is on rapidity distributions of produced\ncharged hadrons as functions of collision energy and centrality which are used\nto infer the fraction of produced particles from a central fireball as compared\nto the one from the fragmentation sources that are out of equilibrium with the\nrest of the system. Overall thermal equilibrium would only be reached for large\ntimes t -> infinity.\n", "  A dimension witness is a criterion that sets a lower bound on the dimension\nneeded to reproduce the observed data. Three types of dimension witnesses can\nbe found in the literature: device-dependent ones, in which the bound is\nobtained assuming some knowledge on the state and the measurements;\ndevice-independent prepare-and-measure ones, that can be applied to any system\nincluding classical ones; and device-independent Bell-based ones, that certify\nthe minimal dimension of some entangled systems. Here we consider the\nCollins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell-type inequality for four\noutcomes. We show that a sufficiently high violation of this inequality\nwitnesses $d \\geq 4$ and present a proof-of-principle experimental observation\nof such a violation. This presents a first experimental violation of the third\ntype of dimension witness beyond qutrits.\n", "  The solar mean magnetic field (SMMF) provided by the Wilcox Solar Observatory\n(WSO) is compared with the SMMF acquired by the \\textit{Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager} (HMI) onboard the \\textit{Solar Dynamic Observatory} (SDO). We\nfound that despite the different spectral lines and measurement techniques used\nin both instruments the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two\ndatasets equals 0.86 while the conversion factor is very close to unity: B(HMI)\n= 0.99(2)B(WSO). We also discuss artifacts of the SDO/HMI magnetic field\nmeasurements, namely the 12 and 24-hour oscillations in SMMF and in sunspots\nmagnetic fields that might be caused by orbital motions of the spacecraft. The\nartificial harmonics of SMMF reveal significant changes in amplitude and the\nnearly stable phase. The connection between the 24-hour harmonic amplitude of\nSMMF and the presence of sunspots is examined. We also found that opposite\nphase artificial 12 and/or 24-hour oscillations exist in sunspots of opposite\npolarities.\n", "  We study the shift of rotational levels of a diatomic polar molecule due to\nits van der Waals (vdW) interaction with a gently curved dielectric surface at\ntemperature $T$, and submicron separations. The molecule is assumed to be in\nits electronic and vibrational ground state, and the rotational degrees are\ndescribed by a rigid rotor model. We show that under these conditions\nretardation effects and surface dispersion can be neglected. The level shifts\nare found to be independent of $T$, and given by the quantum state averaged\nclassical electrostatic interaction of the dipole with its image on the\nsurface. We use a derivative expansion for the static Green's function to\nexpress the shifts in terms of surface curvature. We argue that the curvature\ninduced line splitting is experimentally observable, and not obscured by\nnatural line widths and thermal broadening.\n", "  We apply the Born-Jordan and Weyl quantization formulas for polynomials in\ncanonical coordinates to the constants of motion of some examples of the\nsuperintegrable 2D anisotropic harmonic oscillator. Our aim is to study the\nbehaviour of the algebra of the constants of motion after the different\nquantization procedures. In the examples considered, we have that the Weyl\nformula always preserves the original superintegrable structure of the system,\nwhile the Born-Jordan formula, when producing different operators than the\nWeyl's one, does not.\n", "  We simultaneously investigate source, detector and matter non-standard\nneutrino interactions at the proposed DUNE experiment. Our analysis is\nperformed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploring the full parameter space.\nWe find that the sensitivity of DUNE to the standard oscillation parameters is\nworsened due to the presence of non-standard neutrino interactions. In\nparticular, there are degenerate solutions in the leptonic mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ and the Dirac CP-violating phase $\\delta$. We also compute the\nexpected sensitivities at DUNE to the non-standard interaction parameters. We\nfind that the sensitivities to the matter non-standard interaction parameters\nare substantially stronger than the current bounds (up to a factor of about\n15). Furthermore, we discuss correlations between the source/detector and\nmatter non-standard interaction parameters and find a degenerate solution in\n$\\theta_{23}$. Finally, we explore the effect of statistics on our results.\n", "  Heavy fermions have served as prototype examples of strongly-correlated\nelectron systems. The occurrence of unconventional superconductivity in close\nproximity to the electronic instabilities associated with various degrees of\nfreedom points to an intricate relationship between superconductivity and other\nelectronic states, which is unique but also shares some common features with\nhigh temperature superconductivity. The magnetic order in heavy fermion\ncompounds can be continuously suppressed by tuning external parameters to a\nquantum critical point, and the role of quantum criticality in determining the\nproperties of heavy fermion systems is an important unresolved issue. Here we\nreview the recent progress of studies on Ce based heavy fermion\nsuperconductors, with an emphasis on the superconductivity emerging on the edge\nof magnetic and charge instabilities as well as the quantum phase transitions\nwhich occur by tuning different parameters, such as pressure, magnetic field\nand doping. We discuss systems where multiple quantum critical points occur and\nwhether they can be classified in a unified manner, in particular in terms of\nthe evolution of the Fermi surface topology.\n", "  We present observations of the Pisces A and B galaxies with the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. Photometry from these images\nclearly resolve a Red Giant Branch for both objects, demonstrating that they\nare nearby dwarf galaxies. We describe a Bayesian inferential approach to\ndetermining the distance to these galaxies using the magnitude of the tip of\nthe RGB, and then apply this approach to these galaxies. We also provide the\nfull probability distributions for parameters derived using this approach. This\nreveals the distance to these galaxies as $5.64^{+0.13}_{-0.15} \\, {\\rm Mpc}$\nand $8.89^{+0.75}_{-0.85} \\, {\\rm Mpc}$ for Pisces A and B, respectively,\nplacing both within the Local Volume but not the Local Group. We estimate the\nstar formation histories of these galaxies, which suggests that they have\nrecently undergone an increase in their star formation rates. Together these\nyield luminosities for Pisces A and B of $M_V=-11.57^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ and\n$-12.9 \\pm 0.2$, respectively, and estimated stellar masses of\n$\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot})= 7.0^{+0.4}_{-1.7}$ and $7.5^{+0.3}_{-1.8}$. We further\nshow that these galaxies are likely at the boundary between nearby voids and\nhigher-density filamentary structure. This suggests that they are entering a\nhigher-density region from voids, where they would have experienced delayed\nevolution, consistent with their recent increased star formation rates. If this\nis indeed the case, they are useful for study as proxies of the galaxies that\nlater evolved into typical Local Group satellite galaxies.\n", "  Light possesses both spin and orbital angular momentum (AM). While spin AM is\ndetermined by helicity of circular-polarization, orbital AM is characterized by\ntopological charge of vortex beam. Interaction of AM with optical beam orbit\nleads to optical spin Hall or orbital Hall effect, exhibited as spin-dependent\nor topological charge-dependent transverse shift of optical beam. Conservation\nof AM enables spin-to-orbital AM conversion, where circular-polarized Gaussian\nbeam is converted to opposite-helicity circular-polarized vortex beam with\ntopological charge $\\pm 2$, an example of controlling spatial beam profiling by\nspin flip. However, the resultant vortex beam has the beam center of gravity\nunchanged, the same as that of incident Gaussian beam, meaning a null\ntransverse shift. Here we introduce a cyclic group symmetric metasurface to\ndemonstrate generation of vortex beam exhibiting spin-dependent transverse\nshift, namely, spin- and orbital-Hall effect, attributed to an alteration of\ndynamical phase of scattered beam according to the order $n$ of cyclic group\nwhile keeping geometric phase constant. Capability of spin-controlled spatial\nbeam profiling with a transverse shift via spin- and orbital-Hall effect has\nimportant implications for spatial demultiplexing in optical communication\nutilizing orbital AM mode division multiplexing as well as for optical vortex\ntweezer and signal processing involving vortex beams.\n", "  We present the screenplay of a physics show on particle physics, by the\nPhysikshow of Bonn University. The show is addressed at non-physicists aged 14+\nand communicates basic concepts of elementary particle physics including the\ndiscovery of the Higgs boson in an entertaining fashion. It is also\ndemonstrates a successful outreach activity heavily relying on the university\nphysics students. This paper is addressed at anybody interested in particle\nphysics and/or show physics. This paper is also addressed at fellow physicists\nworking in outreach, maybe the experiments and our choice of simple\nexplanations will be helpful. Furthermore, we are very interested in related\nactivities elsewhere, in particular also demonstration experiments relevant to\nparticle physics, as often little of this work is published.\n  Our show involves 28 live demonstration experiments. These are presented in\nan extensive appendix, including photos and technical details. The show is set\nup as a quest, where 2 students from Bonn with the aid of a caretaker travel\nback in time to understand the fundamental nature of matter. They visit\nRutherford and Geiger in Manchester around 1911, who recount their famous\nexperiment on the nucleus and show how particle detectors work. They travel\nforward in time to meet Lawrence at Berkeley around 1950, teaching them about\nthe how and why of accelerators. Next, they visit Wu at DESY, Hamburg, around\n1980, who explains the strong force. They end up in the LHC tunnel at CERN,\nGeneva, Switzerland in 2012. Two experimentalists tell them about colliders and\nour heroes watch live as the Higgs boson is produced and decays. The show was\npresented in English at Oxford University and University College London, as\nwell as Padua University and ICTP Trieste. It was 1st performed in German at\nthe Deutsche Museum, Bonn (5/'14). The show has eleven speaking parts and\ninvolves in total 20 people.\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) initiative aims at developing the next\ngeneration large scale facility for imaging astronomical optical interferometry\noperating in the mid-infrared. Here we report on the progress of the Planet\nFormation Imager Technical Working Group on the beam-combination instruments.\nWe will discuss various available options for the science and fringe-tracker\nbeam combination instruments, ranging from direct imaging, to non-redundant\nfiber arrays, to integrated optics solutions. Besides considering basic\ncharacteristics of the schemes, we will investigate the maturity of the\navailable technological platforms at near- and mid-infrared wavelengths.\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) is a future kilometric-baseline infrared\ninterferometer to image the complex physical processes of planet formation.\nTechnologies that could be used to transport starlight to a central\nbeam-combining laboratory in PFI include free-space propagation in air or\nvacuum, and optical fibres. This paper addresses the design and cost issues\nassociated with free-space propagation in vacuum pipes. The signal losses due\nto diffraction over long differential paths are evaluated, and conceptual beam\ntransport designs employing pupil management to ameliorate these losses are\npresented and discussed.\n", "  We propose four information-theoretic axioms for the foundations of\nstatistical mechanics in general physical theories. The axioms---Causality,\nPurity Preservation, Pure Sharpness, and Purification---identify a class of\ntheories where every mixed state can be modelled as the marginal of a pure\nentangled state and where every unsharp measurement can be modelled as a sharp\nmeasurement on a composite system. This class of theories, called sharp\ntheories with purification, includes quantum theory both with complex and real\namplitudes, as well as a suitable extension of classical probability theory\nwhere classical systems can be entangled with other, non-classical systems.\nTheories satisfying our axioms support well-behaved notions of majorization,\nentropy, and Gibbs states, allowing for an information-theoretic derivation of\nLandauer's principle. We conjecture that every theory admitting a sensible\nthermodynamics must be extendable to a sharp theory with purification.\n", "  Rotating proto-neutron stars can be important sources of gravitational waves\nto be searched for by present-day and future interferometric detectors. It was\ndemonstrated by Imshennik that in extreme cases the rapid rotation of a\ncollapsing stellar core may lead to fission and formation of a binary\nproto-neutron star which subsequently merges due to gravitational wave\nemission. In the present paper, we show that such dynamically unstable\ncollapsing stellar cores may be the product of a former merger process of two\nstellar cores in a common envelope. We applied population synthesis\ncalculations to assess the expected fraction of such rapidly rotating stellar\ncores which may lead to fission and formation of a pair of proto-neutron stars.\nWe have used the BSE population synthesis code supplemented with a new\ntreatment of stellar core rotation during the evolution via effective\ncore-envelope coupling, characterized by the coupling time, $\\tau_c$. The\nvalidity of this approach is checked by direct MESA calculations of the\nevolution of a rotating 15 $M_\\odot$ star. From comparison of the calculated\nspin distribution of young neutron stars with the observed one, reported by\nPopov and Turolla, we infer the value $\\tau_c \\simeq 5 \\times 10^5$ years. We\nshow that merging of stellar cores in common envelopes can lead to collapses\nwith dynamically unstable proto-neutron stars, with their formation rate being\n$\\sim 0.1-1\\%$ of the total core collapses, depending on the common envelope\nefficiency.\n", "  In direct imaging of exoplanets from space, achieving the required dynamic\nrange (i.e., planet-to-star contrast in brightness) currently relies on\ncoronagraphic technology combined with active control of one or more deformable\nmirrors (DMs) to create a dark region in the image plane, sometimes called a\n\"dark hole.\" While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, all of\nthem employ focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWS) in order to calculate the\noptimal DM configuration to create the desired dark hole. All current\nalgorithms are limited by their own success in that, as the dark hole is\nachieved, the FPWS procedure becomes shot-noise limited due to he low intensity\nin the dark hole. This article proposes a FPWS procedure that allows\ndetermination of the optimal DM configuration without relying on information\nobtained when the DM is near the optimal configuration. This article gives\nregression procedures for FPWS that do not assume the DM step size is small,\nwhich should allow two important improvements to the control loop: 1)\nperforming informative FPWS observations with DM configurations that are\nsufficiently distant from the optimal dark hole configuration to mitigate\nshot-noise limitations, and 2) more accurately predicting the DM configuration\nthat will achieve the desired objective in the dark hole control loop. In order\nto treat this more challenging FPWS problem, two different representations are\npresented. The first of these, is called the empirical Green's function (EGF),\nis easy to implement, and has a block-diagonal matrix structure that is\nwell-suited to parallel processing. The other representation, based on an\nexplicit aberration expansion (EAE) requires the regression to estimate a\nsmaller number of parameters than the EGF, but leads to a dense matrix\nstructure. The EGF and EAE methods both simultaneously estimate the planetary\nimage.\n", "  The Earth-Moon-Sun system has traditionally provided the best laboratory for\ntesting the strong equivalence principle. For a decade, the Apache Point\nObservatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) has been producing the\nworld's best lunar laser ranging data. At present, a single observing session\nof about an hour yields a distance measurement with uncertainty of about 2~mm,\nan order of magnitude advance over the best pre-APOLLO lunar laser ranging\ndata. However, these superb data have not yet yielded scientific results\ncommensurate with their accuracy, number, and temporal distribution. There are\ntwo reasons for this. First, even in the relatively clean environment of the\nEarth-Moon system, a large number of effects modify the measured distance\nimportantly and thus need to be included in the analysis model. The second\nreason is more complicated. The traditional problem with the analysis of\nsolar-system metric data is that the physical model must be truncated to avoid\nextra parameters that would increase the condition number of the estimator.\nEven in a typical APOLLO analysis that does not include parameters of gravity\nphysics, the condition number is very high: $8 \\times 10^{10}$.\n", "  Analyzing the validity and success of a data assimilation algorithm when some\nstate variable observations are not available is an important problem in\nmeteorology and engineering. We present an improved data assimilation algorithm\nfor recovering the exact full reference solution (i.e. the velocity and\ntemperature) of the 3D Planetary Geostrophic model, at an exponential rate in\ntime, by employing coarse spatial mesh observations of the temperature alone.\nThis provides, in the case of this paradigm, a rigorous justification to an\nearlier conjecture of Charney which states that temperature history of the\natmosphere, for certain simple atmospheric models, determines all other state\nvariables.\n", "  Zeeman splitting of quantum-confined states of excitons in InGaAs quantum\nwells (QWs) is experimentally found to depend strongly on quantization energy.\nMoreover, it changes sign when the quantization energy increases with a\ndecrease in the QW width. In the 87-nm QW, the sign change is observed for the\nexcited quantum-confined states, which are above the ground state only by a few\nmeV. A two-step approach for the numerical solution of the two-particle\nSchroedinger equation, taking into account the Coulomb interaction and\nvalence-band coupling, is used for a theoretical justification of the observed\nphenomenon. The calculated variation of the g-factor convincingly follows the\ndependencies obtained in the experiments.\n", "  Investigations of low-energy electron-scattering of the lanthanide atoms Eu,\nNd, Tb, Tm demonstrate that electron-correlation effects and core polarization\nare the dominant fundamental many-body effects responsible for the formation of\nmetastable states of negative ions. Ramsauer Townsend minima, shape resonances\nand binding energies of the resultant anions are identified and extracted from\nthe elastic total cross sections calculated using the complex angular momentum\nmethod. The large discrepancy between the recently measured electron affinity\nof 0.116 and the previously measured value of 1.053 eV for Eu is resolved.\nAlso, the previously measured electron affinities for Nd, Tb and Tm are\nreconciled and new values are extracted from the calculated total cross\nsections. The large electron affinities found here for these atoms, should be\nuseful in negative ion nanocatalysis, including methane conversion to methanol\nwithout CO2 emission, with significant environmental impact.. The powerful\ncomplex angular momentum method which requires only a few poles, yields\nreliable binding energies for the metastable states of negative ions with no a\npriori knowledge of experimental or other theoretical data and should be\napplicable to other complex systems for the fundamental understanding of their\ninteractions.\n", "  We present a computational study of terahertz optical properties of a\ngrating-coupled plasmonic structure based on micrometer-thin InSb layers. We\nfind two strong absorption resonances that we interpret as standing surface\nplasmon modes and investigate their dispersion relations, dependence on InSb\nthickness, and the spatial distribution of the electric field. The observed\nsurface plasmon modes are well described by a simple theory of the air/InSb/air\ntrilayer. The plasmonic response of the grating/InSb structure is highly\nsensitive to the dielectric environment and the presence of an analyte (e.g.,\nlactose) at the InSb interface, which is promising for terahertz plasmonic\nsensor applications. We determine the sensor sensitivity to be 7200 nm per\nrefractive index unit (or 0.06 THz per refractive index unit). The lower\nsurface plasmon mode also exhibits a splitting when tuned in resonance with the\nvibrational mode of lactose at 1.37 THz. We propose that such interaction\nbetween surface plasmon and vibrational modes can be used as the basis for a\nnew sensing modality that allows the detection of terahertz vibrational\nfingerprints of an analyte.\n", "  The transport of solid particles by a fluid flow is frequently found in\nnature and industry. Some examples are the transport of sand in rivers and\nhydrocarbon pipelines. When the shear stresses exerted by a fluid flow on a\ngranular bed remain moderate, some grains are set in motion without fluidizing\nthe bed; the moving grains form a layer, known as bed load, that moves while\nmaintaining contact with the fixed part of the bed. Under bed load conditions,\nthe granular bed may become unstable, generating ripples and dunes. Sand\nripples are commonly observed in closed conduits and pipes such as in petroleum\npipelines, sewer systems, and dredging lines. Although of importance for many\nscientific domains and industrial applications, the formation of ripples in\nclosed conduits is not well understood, and the problem is still open. This\npaper presents an experimental study on the formation and migration of sand\nripples under a turbulent closed-conduit flow and bed-load conditions. In our\nexperiments, fully-developed turbulent water flows were imposed over a granular\nbed of known granulometry in a transparent channel, and bed load took place.\nFor different water flow rates and grain diameters, the growth and migration of\nbedforms were filmed by a high-definition camera, and a numerical code was\ndeveloped to determine the wavelength and celerity of the bedforms from the\nacquired images. The obtained results are compared with published stability\nanalyses.\n", "  While the discovery of non-zero neutrino masses is one of the most important\naccomplishments by physicists in the past century, it is still unknown how and\nin what form these masses arise. Lepton number-violating neutrinoless double\nbeta decay is a natural consequence of Majorana neutrinos and many BSM\ntheories, and many experimental efforts are involved in the search for these\nprocesses. Understanding how neutrinoless double beta decay would manifest in\nnuclear environments is key for understanding any observed signals. In these\nproceedings we present an overview of a set of one- and two-body matrix\nelements relevant for experimental searches for neutrinoless double beta decay,\ndescribe the role of lattice QCD calculations, and present preliminary lattice\nQCD results.\n", "  The Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager, AOLI, is an instrument developed to deliver\nthe highest spatial resolution ever obtained in the visible, 20 mas, from\nground-based telescopes. In AOLI a new philosophy of instrumental prototyping\nhas been applied, based on the modularization of the subsystems. This modular\nconcept offers maximum flexibility regarding the instrument, telescope or the\naddition of future developments.\n", "  The FastCam instrument platform, jointly developed by the IAC and the UPCT,\nallows, in real-time, acquisition, selection and storage of images with a\nresolution that reaches the diffraction limit of medium-sized telescopes.\nFastCam incorporates a specially designed software package to analyse series of\ntens of thousands of images in parallel with the data acquisition at the\ntelescope. Wide FastCam is a new instrument that, using the same software for\ndata acquisition, does not look for lucky imaging but fast observations in a\nmuch larger field of view. Here we describe the commissioning process and first\nobservations with Wide FastCam at the Telescopio Carlos S\\'anchez (TCS) in the\nObservatorio del Teide.\n", "  Quantum dots (QDs) are applied in a variety of fields ranging from\nphotovoltaics to biomedical imaging. Even the smallest QDs present a\ncomplicated potential energy surface characterized by a large set of stationary\npoints. Each local minimum is an isomer of QD of given composition. An\nestablished theoretical methodology is hereby employed to obtain geometries of\nthe QD isomers (Cd16Se16, Cd16Se16, Zn16S16, Zn16Se16) and predict their\nfundamental electronic and thermodynamic properties. Significantly scattered\nheats of formation, with an amplitude up to 1304 kcal mol-1 in Cd16S16, were\nfound for the most and the least thermodynamically stable isomers of QDs. The\nmost shallow transition points can unlikely be observed in the experiments at\nfinite temperature, since they are able to transform into more stable isomers\nupon thermal motion. Dipole moment is the most sensitive property to the QD\nisomer geometry. A global energy search technique was demonstrated to be an\nefficient tool to systematically identify isomers of QDs.\n", "  Nonlinear cascade of low-frequency Alfvenic fluctuations (AFs) is regarded as\none candidate of the energy sources to heat plasma during the non-adiabatic\nexpansion of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). However, AFs inside\nICMEs were seldom reported in the literature. In this study, we investigate AFs\ninside ICMEs using observations from Voyager 2 between 1 and 6 au. It is found\nthat AFs with high degree of Alfvenicity frequently occurred inside ICMEs, for\nalmost all the identified ICMEs (30 out of 33 ICMEs), and 12.6% of ICME time\ninterval. As ICMEs expand and move outward, the percentage of AF duration\ndecays linearly in general. The occurrence rate of AFs inside ICMEs is much\nless than that in ambient solar wind, especially within 4 au. AFs inside ICMEs\nare more frequently presented in the center and at the boundaries of ICMEs. In\naddition, the proton temperature inside ICME has a similar distribution. These\nfindings suggest significant contribution of AFs on local plasma heating inside\nICMEs.\n", "  What happens if in QMA the quantum channel between Merlin and Arthur is\nnoisy? It is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the\ncomputational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are\ncorrectable with high probability, since if Merlin encodes the witness state in\na quantum error-correction code and sends it to Arthur, Arthur can correct the\nerror caused by the noisy channel. If we further assume that Arthur can do only\nsingle-qubit measurements, however, the problem becomes nontrivial, since in\nthis case Arthur cannot do the universal quantum computation by himself. In\nthis paper, we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent\nto QMA. To show it, we use measurement-based quantum computing: honest Merlin\nsends the graph state to Arthur, and Arthur does fault-tolerant\nmeasurement-based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only\nsingle-qubit measurements. By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also\nchecks the correctness of the graph state. Although this idea itself was\nalready used in several previous papers, these results cannot be directly used\nto the present case, since the test that checks the graph state used in these\npapers is so strict that even honest Merlin is rejected with high probability\nif the channel is noisy. We therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can\naccept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are\nerror-correctable.\n", "  A highly feasible dressed-state scheme, which greatly speeds up the adiabatic\npopulation transfer of a quantum system, is applied for implementing a fast\nCNOT gate in a cavity QED system. The cavity QED system consists of two\nidentical five-level atoms which are respectively trapped in two optical\ncavities connected by a fiber. With the help of quantum Zeno dynamics, the CNOT\ngate is constructed by three steps with six pulses. Because the adiabatic\ncondition is not necessary to be considered and all of the pulses are smoothly\nturned on and off, the scheme is fast and feasible in experiment. Numerical\nsimulations indicate that the average fidelity for constructing the CNOT gate\nis quite high and the gate operation time is relatively short. Moreover, the\neffects on the fidelity of the atomic spontaneous emission and the photon\nleakages from the cavities are discussed by the master equation and the result\nshows the scheme is robust against the decoherence.\n", "  This paper proposes fractional sliding control designs for\nsingle-degree-of-freedom fractional oscillators respectively of the\nKelvin-Voigt type, the modified Kelvin-Voigt type and D\\\"{u}ffing type, whose\ndynamical behaviors are described by second-order differential equations\ninvolving fractional derivatives. Firstly, the differential equations of motion\nare transformed into non-commensurate fractional state equations by introducing\nstate variables with physical significance. Secondly, fractional sliding\nmanifolds are constructed and stability of the corresponding sliding dynamics\nis addressed via the infinite state approach and Lyapunov stability theory.\nThirdly, sliding control laws and adaptive sliding laws are designed for\nfractional oscillators respectively in cases that the bound of the external\nexciting force is known or unknown. Finally, numerical simulations are carried\nout to validate the above control designs.\n", "  We have analysed the chemical and kinematic properties of the 20 and 50 km\ns$^{-1}$ molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way\nGalaxy, as well as those of the molecular ridge bridging these two clouds. Our\nwork has utilized 37 molecular transitions in the 0.65, 3 and 7-mm wavebands,\nfrom the Mopra and NANTEN2 telescopes. The 0.65-mm NANTEN2 data highlights a\ndense condensation of emission within the western part of the 20 km s$^{-1}$\ncloud, visible in only four other transitions, which are 3-mm H$^{13}$CN\n(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ (1--0), HNC (1--0) and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ (1--0),\nsuggesting that the condensation is moderately optically thick and cold. We\nfind that while the relative chemical abundances between both clouds are alike\nin many transitions, suggesting little variation in the chemistry between both\nclouds; the 20 km s$^{-1}$, cold cloud is brighter than the 50 km s$^{-1}$\ncloud in shock and high density tracers. The spatial distribution of enhanced\nemission is widespread in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud, as shown via line ratio\nmaps. The position velocity diagrams across both clouds indicate that the gas\nis well mixed. We show that the molecular ridge is most likely part of the 20\nkm s$^{-1}$ cloud and that both of them may possibly extend to include the 50\nkm s$^{-1}$ cloud, as part of one larger cloud. Furthermore, we expect that the\n20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud is being tidally sheared as a result of the gravitational\npotential from Sgr A*.\n", "  The VLTI instrument GRAVITY combines the beams from four telescopes and\nprovides phase-referenced imaging as well as precision-astrometry of order 10\nmicroarcseconds by observing two celestial objects in dual-field mode. Their\nangular separation can be determined from their differential OPD (dOPD) when\nthe internal dOPDs in the interferometer are known. Here, we present the\ngeneral overview of the novel metrology system which performs these\nmeasurements. The metrology consists of a three-beam laser system and a\nhomodyne detection scheme for three-beam interference using phase-shifting\ninterferometry in combination with lock-in amplifiers. Via this approach the\nmetrology system measures dOPDs on a nanometer-level.\n", "  Organic liquid scintillators are used in many neutrino physics experiments of\nthe past and present. In particular for low energy neutrinos when realtime and\nenergy information are required, liquid scintillators have several advantages\ncompared to other technologies. In many cases the organic liquid needs to be\nloaded with metal to enhance the neutrino signal over background events.\nSeveral metal loaded scintillators of the past suffered from chemical and\noptical instabilities, limiting the performance of these neutrino detectors.\nDifferent ways of metal loading are described in the article with a focus on\nrecent techniques providing metal loaded scintillators that can be used under\nstable conditions for many years even in ton scale experiments. Applications of\nmetal loaded scintillators in neutrino experiments are reviewed and the\nperformance as well as the prospects of different scintillator types are\ncompared.\n", "  A stochastic configuration interaction method based on evolutionary algorithm\nis designed as an affordable approximation to full configuration interaction\n(FCI). The algorithm comprises of initiation, propagation and termination\nsteps, where the propagation step is performed with cloning, mutation and\ncross-over, taking inspiration from genetic algorithm. We have tested its\naccuracy in 1D Hubbard problem and a molecular system (symmetric bond breaking\nof water molecule). We have tested two different fitness functions based on\nenergy of the determinants and the CI coefficients of determinants. We find\nthat the absolute value of CI coefficients is a more suitable fitness function\nwhen combined with a fixed selection scheme.\n", "  We present here a powerful method providing simultaneous atomic spatial and\nnanosecond temporal resolution for investigating dynamics and structure on the\natomic scale, in general. We reveal the dynamic reorganization of surface\n(ad)atoms induced by radio frequency alternating charging and decharging of a\nmetal. Our method utilizes taylor-made nano-fabricated two-dimensional islands\nof physisorbed argon atoms, acting as motion sensors, probed by a radio\nfrequency low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope.\n", "  We analyze theoretical models of gravitational waves generation in the\ninteraction of high intensity laser with matter, namely ablation and piston\nmodels. We analyse the generated gravitational waves in linear approximation of\ngravitational theory. We derive the analytical formulas and estimates for the\nmetric perturbations and the radiated power of generated gravitational waves.\nFurthermore we investigate the characteristics of polarization and the\nbehaviour of test particles in the presence of gravitational wave which will be\nimportant for the detection.\n", "  Li\\'enard-type equations are used for the description of various phenomena in\nphysics and other fields of science. Here we find a new family of the\nLi\\'enard-type equations which admits a non-standard autonomous Lagrangian. As\na by-product we obtain autonomous first integrals for each member of this\nfamily of equations. We also show that some of the previously known conditions\nfor the existence of a non-standard Lagrangian for the Li\\'enard-type equations\nfollow from the linearizability of the corresponding equation via nonlocal\ntransformations.\n", "  Recently the new model for the generation of strong large scale magnetic\nfields in neutron stars, driven by the parity violating interaction, was\nproposed. In this model, the magnetic field instability results from the\nmodification of the chiral magnetic effect in presence of the electroweak\ninteraction between ultrarelativistic electrons and nucleons. In the present\nwork we study how a nonzero mass of charged particles, which are degenerate\nrelativistic electrons and nonrelativistic protons, influences the generation\nof the magnetic field in frames of this approach. For this purpose we calculate\nthe induced electric current of these charged particles, electroweakly\ninteracting with background neutrons and an external magnetic field, exactly\naccounting for the particle mass. This current is calculated by two methods:\nusing the exact solution of the Dirac equation for a charged particle in\nexternal fields and computing the polarization operator of a photon in matter\ncomposed of background neutrons. We show that the induced current is vanishing\nin both approaches leading to the zero contribution of massive particles to the\ngenerated magnetic field. We discuss the implication of our results for the\nproblem of the magnetic field generation in compact stars.\n", "  A correct modelling of the underlying event in proton-proton collisions is\nimportant for the proper simulation of kinematic distributions of high-energy\ncollisions. The ATLAS collaboration extended previous studies at 7 TeV with a\nleading track or jet or Z boson by a new study of Drell-Yan events in 1.1 1/fb\nof data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In this new study the\ndistributions of several topological event-shape variables based on charged\nparticles are measured, both integrated and differential in the transverse\nmomentum of the Drell-Yan lepton pair. These measurements are sensitive to the\nunderlying-event as well as the onset of hard emissions. The results have been\ncompared with the predictions of several state-of-the-art MC generators. The\ncollaboration has also performed a first study of the number and transverse\nmomentum sum of charged particles as a function of transverse momentum and\nazimuthal angle in a special data set taken with low beam currents at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The results are compared to predictions of\nseveral MC generators.\n", "  We study the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking in dissipationless\nresonant tunneling heterostructures (RTS). To describe the quantum transport in\nthis system we apply both the nonequilibrium Green function formalism based on\na tight-binding model and a numerical solution of the Schroedinger equation\nwithin the envelope wavefunction formalism. An auxiliary non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian is introduced. Its eigenvalues determine exactly the transparency\npeak positions. We present a procedure how to construct a family of\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real eigenvalues. In general these Hamiltonians\ndo not have PT-symmetry. In spatially symmetric RTS the corresponding auxiliary\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian becomes PT-symmetric and possesses real eigenvalues,\nwhich can coalesce at exceptional points (EP) of Hamiltonian. A coalescence of\nthe auxiliary non-Hermitian Hamiltonian eigenvalues means a coalescence of\nresonances in RTS, which is accompanied be symmetry breaking of the electron\nwavefunction probability distribution (at a given direction of the particle\nflow). We construct a classification of different types of the peak coalescence\nin terms of the catastrophe theory and investigate the impact of dissipation\nand asymmetry on these phenomena. Possible applications include sensors and\nbroad-band filters.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of far-IR CO emission from protostars observed\nwith Herschel/PACS for 50 sources from the combined sample of HOPS and DIGIT\nHerschel key programs. From the uniformly sampled spectral energy\ndistributions, we computed $L_{\\rm{bol}}$, $T_{\\rm{bol}}$ and $L_{\\rm\n{bol}}/L_{\\rm {smm}}$ for these sources to search for correlations between\nfar-IR CO emission and protostellar properties. We find a strong and tight\ncorrelation between far-IR CO luminosity ($L^{\\rm fir}_{\\rm CO}$) and the\nbolometric luminosity ($L_{\\rm{bol}}$) of the protostars with $L^{\\rm fir}_{\\rm\nCO}$ $\\propto$ $L_{\\rm{bol}}^{0.7}$. We, however, do not find a strong\ncorrelation between $L^{\\rm fir}_{\\rm CO}$ and protostellar evolutionary\nindicators, $T_{\\rm{bol}}$ and $L_{\\rm {bol}}/L_{\\rm {smm}}$. FIR CO emission\nfrom protostars traces the currently shocked gas by jets/outflows, and $L^{\\rm\nfir}_{\\rm CO}$ is proportional to the instantaneous mass loss rate,\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm{out}}$. The correlation between $L^{\\rm fir}_{\\rm CO}$ and\n$L_{\\rm{bol}}$ is indicative of instantaneous $\\dot{M}_{\\rm{out}}$ tracking\ninstantaneous $\\dot{M}_{\\rm{acc}}$. The lack of correlation between $L^{\\rm\nfir}_{\\rm CO}$ and evolutionary indicators $T_{\\rm{bol}}$ and $L_{\\rm\n{bol}}/L_{\\rm {smm}}$ suggests that $\\dot{M}_{\\rm{out}}$ and, therefore,\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm{acc}}$ do not show any clear evolutionary trend. These results\nare consistent with mass accretion/ejection in protostars being episodic. Taken\ntogether with the previous finding that the time-averaged mass\nejection/accretion rate declines during the protostellar phase (e.g., Bontemps\net al. 1996), our results suggest that the instantaneous accretion/ejection\nrate of protostars is highly time variable and episodic, but the amplitude\nand/or frequency of this variability decreases with time such that the time\naveraged accretion/ejection rate declines with system age.\n", "  In the first two papers in this series, we developed new shifted potential\n(SP), gradient shifted force (GSF), and Taylor shifted force (TSF) real-space\nmethods for multipole interactions in condensed phase simulations. Here, we\ndiscuss the dielectric properties of fluids that emerge from simulations using\nthese methods. Most electrostatic methods (including the Ewald sum) require\ncorrection to the conducting boundary fluctuation formula for the static\ndielectric constants, and we discuss the derivation of these corrections for\nthe new real space methods. For quadrupolar fluids, the analogous material\nproperty is the quadrupolar susceptibility. As in the dipolar case, the\nfluctuation formula for the quadrupolar susceptibility has corrections that\ndepend on the electrostatic method being utilized. One of the most important\neffects measured by both the static dielectric and quadrupolar susceptibility\nis the ability to screen charges embedded in the fluid. We use potentials of\nmean force between solvated ions to discuss how geometric factors can lead to\ndistance-dependent screening in both quadrupolar and dipolar fluids.\n", "  Ultra high energy neutrinos may be observed in ice by the emission of\nacoustic signals. The SPATS detector has investigated the possibility of\nobserving GZK-neutrinos in the clear ice near the South Pole at the IceCube\ndetector site. To explore other potential detection sites glacial ice in the\nAlps and in Antarctica has been surveyed for its acoustical properties. The\npurpose of the Enceladus Explorer (EnEx), on the other hand, is the search for\nextraterrestrial life on the Saturn moon Enceladus. Here acoustics is used to\nmaneuver a subsurface probe inside the ice by trilateration of signals. A\nsystem of acoustic transducers has been developed to study both applications.\nIn the south polar region of the moon Enceladus there are secluded crevasses.\nThese are filled with liquid water, probably heated by tidal forces due to the\nshort distance to Saturn. We intend to take a sample of water from these\ncrevasses by using a combination of a melt down and steering probe called\nIceMole (IM). Maneuvering IM requires a good understanding of ice properties\nsuch as the speed of sound, the attenuation of acoustic signals in ice, their\ndirectional dependencies and their dependence on different frequencies. The\ntechnology developed for this positioning system could also contribute to the\ndesign of future large scale acoustic neutrino detectors. We present our\nanalysis methods and the findings on attenuation, sound speed, and frequency\nresponse obtained at several sites in the Alps and Antarctica.\n", "  We provide an example of a smooth, divergence-free $\\nabla \\cdot\n\\vec{u}(\\vec{x})=0$ velocity vector field $\\vec{u}(\\vec{x})$ for incompressible\nfluid occupying all of $R^{3}$ space, and smooth vector field $\\vec{f}(\\vec{x},\nt)$ for which the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluid does not have\na solution for any position in space $\\vec{x}\\in R^{3} $ at $t=0$. The velocity\nvector field $u_{i} (\\vec{x})=2\\frac{x_{h(i-1)} -x_{h(i+1)} }{\\left(1+\\sum\n_{j=1}^{3}x_{j}^{2} \\right)^{2} }$ ; $i=\\{ 1,2,3\\} $ where\n$h(l)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccc} {l} & {;1\\le l\\le 3} & {} \\\\ {1} & {;l=4} & {}\n\\\\ {3} & {;l=0} & {} \\end{array}\\right.$ is smooth, divergence-free,\ncontinuously differentiable $u(\\vec{x})\\in C^{\\infty }$, has bounded energy\n$\\int _{R^{3} }\\left|\\vec{u}\\right|^{2} dx=\\pi ^{2}$, zero velocity at\ncoordinate origin, and velocity converges to zero for $\\left|\\vec{x}\\right|\\to\n\\infty$. The vector field $\\vec{f}(\\vec{x},t)=(0,0,\\frac{1}{1+t^{2} (\\sum\n_{j=1}^{3}x_{j} )^{2} )} $ is smooth, continuously differentiable\n$f(\\vec{x},t)\\in C^{\\infty }$, converging to zero for $\\left|\\vec{x}\\right|\\to\n\\infty$. Applying $\\vec{u}(\\vec{x})$ and $\\vec{f}(\\vec{x}, t)$ in the\nNavier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluid results with three mutually\ndifferent solutions for pressure $p(\\vec{x}, t)$, one of which includes zero\ndivision with zero $\\frac{0}{0}$ term at $t=0$, which is indeterminate for all\npositions $\\vec{x} \\in R^{3}$.\n", "  Quantum and classical models for delayed choice entanglement swapping by\npostselection of measurements are discussed.\n", "  In this historical note, we wish to highlight the crucial conceptual role\nplayed by the principle of virtual work of analytical mechanics, in working out\nthe fundamental notion of parallel transport on a Riemannian manifold, which\nopened the way to the theory of connections and gauge theories. Moreover, after\na detailed historical-technical reconstruction of the original Levi-Civita's\nargument, a further historiographical deepening and a related critical\ndiscussion of the question, are pursued.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the future large observatory in the\nvery high energy (VHE) domain. Operating from 20 GeV to 300 TeV, it will be\ncomposed of tens of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) displaced in a\nlarge area of a few square kilometers in both the southern and northern\nhemispheres. The CTA/DATA On-Site Analysis (OSA) is the system devoted to the\ndevelopment of dedicated pipelines and algorithms to be used at the CTA site\nfor the reconstruction, data quality monitoring, science monitoring and\nrealtime science alerting during observations. The OSA integral sensitivity is\ncomputed here for the most studied source at Gamma-rays, the Crab Nebula, for a\nset of exposures ranging from 1000 seconds to 50 hours, using the full CTA\nSouthern array. The reason for the Crab Nebula selection as the first example\nof OSA integral sensitivity is twofold: (i) this source is characterized by a\nbroad spectrum covering the entire CTA energy range; (ii) it represents, at the\ntime of writing, the standard candle in VHE and it is often used as unit for\nthe IACTs sensitivity. The effect of different Crab Nebula emission models on\nthe CTA integral sensitivity is evaluated, to emphasize the need for\nrepresentative spectra of the CTA science targets in the evaluation of the OSA\nuse cases. Using the most complete model as input to the OSA integral\nsensitivity, we obtain a significant detection of the Crab nebula (about 10% of\nflux) even for a 1000 second exposure, for an energy threshold less than 10\nTeV.\n", "  Here we explore the possible preexisting circumstellar debris of supernova\ntype Ia systems. Classical, symbiotic and recurrent novae all accrete onto\nroughly solar mass white dwarfs from main sequence or Mira type companions and\nresult in thermonuclear runaways and expulsion of the accreted material at high\nvelocity. The expelled material forms a fast moving shell that eventually slows\nto planetary nebula expansion velocities within several hundred years. All such\nsystems are recurrent and thousands of shells (each of about 0.001 Mo) snow\nplough into the environment. As these systems involve common envelope binaries\nthe material is distributed in a non-spherical shell. These systems could be\nprogenitors of some SN Ia and thus explode into environments with large amounts\nof accumulated gas and dust distributed in thin non-spherical shells. Such\nshells should be observable around 100 years after a SN Ia event in a radio\nflash as the SN Ia debris meets that of the ejected material of the systems\nprevious incarnation.\n", "  First-principles calculations on monolayer 8-{\\it Pmmn} borophene are\nreported to reveal unprecedented electronic properties in a two-dimensional\nmaterial. Based on a Born effective charge analysis, 8-{\\it Pmmn} borophene is\nthe first single-element based monolayered material exhibiting two sublattices\nwith substantial ionic features. The observed Dirac cones are actually formed\nby the p$_z$ orbitals of one of the inequivalent sublattices composed of\nuniquely four atoms, yielding an underlying hexagonal network topologically\nequivalent to distorted graphene. A significant physical outcome of this effect\nincludes the possibility of converting metallic 8-{\\it Pmmn} borophene into an\nindirect band gap semiconductor by means of external shear stress. The\nstability of the strained structures are supported by a phonon frequency\nanalysis. The Dirac cones are sensitive to the formation of vacancies only in\nthe inequivalent sublattice electronically active at the Fermi level.\n", "  The article represents a research of the cosmological evolution of fermion\nstatistical systems with fantom scalar interaction where \"kinetic\" term's\ncontribution to the total energy of a scalar field is negative. As a result of\nanalytical and numerical simulation of such systems it has been revealed a\nexistence of four possible scenarios depending on parameters of the system and\ninitial conditions. Among these scenarios there are scenarios with an early,\nintermediate and late non-relativistic stages of the cosmological evolution,\nall of which also have necessary inflation stage.\n", "  Many metastable systems can nucleate to multiple competing stable or\nintermediate metastable states. In this work, a Potts model, subject to\nexternal fields, is used to study the competitive nucleation of two phases\nattempting to grow on a microscopic impurity. Monte Carlo simulations are used\nto calculate the free energy surfaces for the system under different\nconditions, where the relative stability of the phases is adjusted by changing\nthe interaction parameters, and the nucleation rates obtained using\nmulticomponent transition state theory are compared with the rates measured\nusing the survival probability method. We find that the two methods predict\nsimilar nucleation rates when the free energy barrier used in the transition\nstate theory is defined as the work required to form a critical embryo from the\nmetastable phase. An analysis of the free energy surfaces also reveals that the\ncompetition between the nucleating phases leads to an effective drying of the\nimpurity which slows down the nucleation rate compared to the single phase\ncase.\n", "  LiZn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ is an electrically insulating geometrically frustrated\nantiferromagnet in which inorganic Mo$_3$O$_{13}$ clusters each behaves as a\nsingle $S = 1/2$ unit, with the clusters arranged on a two-dimensional\ntriangular lattice. Prior results have shown that LiZn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ does not\nexhibit static magnetic order down to at least $T = 0.05\\,K$, and instead\npossesses a valence bond ground state. Here, we show that LiZn$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$\ncan be hole doped by oxidation with $\\mathrm{I}_2$ and subsequent removal of\n$\\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ cations to access the entire range of electron count, from\none to zero unpaired electrons per site on the triangular lattice. Contrary to\nexpectations, no metallic state is induced; instead, the primary effect is to\nsuppress the number of sites contributing to the condensed valence-bond state.\nFurther, diffraction and pair-distribution function analysis show no evidence\nfor local Jahn-Teller distortions or other deviations from the parent trigonal\nsymmetry as a function of doping or temperature. Taken together, the data and\ndensity functional theory calculations indicate that removal of electrons from\nthe magnetic layers favors Anderson localization of the resulting hole and an\nincrease in the electrical band-gap over the formation of a metallic and\nsuperconducting state. These results put strong constraints on the chemical\nconditions necessary to realize metallic states from parent insulating\ngeometrically frustrated antiferromagnets.\n", "  Some argue that political stability is best served through a two-party\nsystem. This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the\nstability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of\nelectors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of\nelectors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of\nelectors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well\nresolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive\n-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,\nelectoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their\nprobabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no\nfluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As\nthe quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with\nit the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.\nRigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party\nloyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing\nthe quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing\nthe quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties\nat the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the\nmore concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.\n", "  This paper presents research comparing the effects of different environments\non the outcome of an extended Prisoner's Dilemma, in which agents have the\noption to abstain from playing the game. We consider three different pure\nstrategies: cooperation, defection and abstinence. We adopt an evolutionary\ngame theoretic approach and consider two different environments: the first\nwhich imposes no spatial constraints and the second in which agents are placed\non a lattice grid. We analyse the performance of the three strategies as we\nvary the loner's payoff in both structured and unstructured environments.\nFurthermore we also present the results of simulations which identify scenarios\nin which cooperative clusters of agents emerge and persist in both\nenvironments.\n", "  We establish a new theoretical framework, based on a time-dependent mean\nfield approach, to address the dynamics of the driven Dicke model. The joint\nevolution of both mean fields and quantum fluctuations gives rise to a rich and\ngenerally non-linear dynamics, featuring a normal (stable) regime and an\nunstable, super-radiant one. Various dynamical phenomena emerge, such as the\nspontaneous amplification of vacuum fluctuations, or the appearance of special\npoints around which the mean-field amplitudes rotate during driven time\nevolution, signalling a dynamical symmetry breaking. We also provide a\ncharacterization of the driving-induced photon production in terms of the work\ndone by the driving agent, of the non-adiabaticity of the process and of the\nentanglement generated between the atomic system and the cavity mode.\n", "  Harnessing information and energy from light within a nanoscale mode volume\nis a fundamental challenge for nanophotonic applications ranging from solar\nphotovoltaics to single photon detectors. Here, we show the existence of a\nuniversal condition in materials that sheds light on fundamental limits of\nelectromagnetic to matter energy conversion (transduction). We show that the\nupper limit of absorption rate (transduction rate) in any nanoscale absorber\nconverting light to matter degrees of freedom is revealed by the zero of\noptical conductivity at complex frequencies ($\\sigma(\\omega^\\prime +\ni\\omega^{\\prime\\prime})= 0$). We trace the origin of this universal zero\nconductivity condition to causality requirements on any passive linear response\nfunction and propose an experiment of absorption resonances using plasmonic\nnanoparticles to experimentally verify this universal zero conductivity\ncondition. Our work is widely applicable to linear systems across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum and allows for systematic optimization of optical\nabsorption in single photon detectors, solar cells, Coherent Perfect Absorbers\nand SPASERS.\n", "  We report the first measurements of the dynamics of liquid germanium (l-Ge)\nby quasi-elastic neutron scattering on time-of-flight and triple-axis\nspectrometers. These results are compared with simulation data of the structure\nand dynamics of l-Ge which have been obtained with ab initio density functional\ntheory methods. The simulations accurately reproduce previous results from\nelastic and inelastic scattering experiments, as well as the q-dependence of\nthe width of the quasi-elastic signal of the new experimental data. In order to\nunderstand some special features of the structure of the liquid we have also\nsimulated amorphous Ge. Overall we find that the atomistic model represents\naccurately the average structure of real l-Ge as well as the time dependent\nstructural fluctuations. The new quasi-elastic neutron scattering data allows\nus to investigate to what extent simple theoretical models can be used to\ndescribe diffusion in l-Ge.\n"]}
