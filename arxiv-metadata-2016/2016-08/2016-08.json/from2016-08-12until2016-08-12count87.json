A bi-Hamiltonian\nstructure $(\\mathcal P, \\mathcal Q)$ is called flat if $\\mathcal P$ and\n$\\mathcal Q$ can be simultaneously brought to a constant form in a neighborhood\nof a generic point. We prove that a generic bi-Hamiltonian structure $(\\mathcal\nP, \\mathcal Q)$ on an odd-dimensional manifold is flat if and only if there\nexists a local density which is preserved by all vector fields Hamiltonian with\nrespect to $\\mathcal P$, as well as by all vector fields Hamiltonian with\nrespect to $\\mathcal Q$.\n", "  In this paper we will show how Mensky's model of \"restricted path integrals\"\ncan be derived from GRW \"spontaneous collapse\" model.\n", "  It is commonly assumed that zero and non-zero photon mass would lead to\nqualitatively different physics. For example, massless photon has two\npolarization degrees of freedom, while massive photon at least three. This\nfeature seems counter-intuitive. In this paper we will show that if we change\npropagator by setting $i \\epsilon$ (needed to avoid poles) to a finite value,\nand also introduce it in a way that breaks Lawrentz symmetry, then we would\nobtain the continuous transition we desire once the speed of the photons is\n\"large enough\" with respect to \"preferred\" frame. The two transverse\npolarization degrees of freedom will be long lived, while longitudinal will be\nshort lived. Their lifetime will be near-zero if $m \\ll \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, which\nis where the properties of two circular polarizations arize. The $i \\epsilon$\ncorresponds to the intensity of Mensky's \"continuous measurement\" and the short\nlifetime of the longitudinal photons can be understood as the \"conversion\" of\nquantum degrees of freedom (photons) into \"classical\" ones by the measurement\ndevice (thus getting rid of the former). While the \"classical\" trajectory of\nthe longitudinal photons does arize, it plays no physical role due to quantum\nZeno effect: intuitively, it is similar to an electron being kept at a ground\nstate due to continuous measurement.\n", "  We establish Ahlswede dichotomy for arbitrarily varying classical-quantum\nwiretap channels. This means that either the deterministic secrecy capacity of\nan arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channel is zero or it equals\nits randomness-assisted secrecy capacity. We analyze the secrecy capacity of\narbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels when the sender and the\nreceiver use various resources. It turns out that having randomness, common\nrandomness, and correlation as resources are very helpful for achieving a\npositive deterministic secrecy capacity of arbitrarily varying\nclassical-quantum wiretap channels. We prove the phenomenon super-activation\nfor arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels, i.e., if we use two\narbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels, both with zero\ndeterministic secrecy capacity together, they allow perfect secure\ntransmission.\n", "  The new derivation of the equation of the spin precession is given for a\nparticle possessing electric and magnetic dipole moments. Contributions from\nclassical electrodynamics and from the Thomas effect are explicitly separated.\nA fully covariant approach is used. The final equation is expressed in a very\nsimple form in terms of the fields in the instantaneously accompanying frame.\nThe Lorentz transformations of the electric and magnetic dipole moments and of\nthe spin are derived from basic equations of classical electrodynamics. For\nthis purpose, the Maxwell equations in matter are used and the result is\nconfirmed by other methods. An antisymmetric four-tensor is correctly\nconstructed from the electric and magnetic dipole moments.\n", "  Previous studies on magnetic flux expulsion as a function of cooling details\nhave been performed for superconducting niobium cavities with the cavity beam\naxis placed parallel respect to the helium cooling flow, and findings showed\nthat for sufficient cooling thermogradients all magnetic flux could be expelled\nand very low residual resistance could be achieved. In this paper we\ninvestigate the flux trapping and its impact on radio frequency surface\nresistance when the resonators are positioned perpendicularly to the helium\ncooling flow, which is representative of how superconducting radio-frequency\n(SRF) cavities are cooled in an accelerator. We also extend the studies to\ndifferent directions of applied magnetic field surrounding the resonator.\nResults show that in the cavity horizontal configuration there is a different\nimpact of the various field components on the final surface resistance, and\nthat several parameters have to be considered to understand flux dynamics. A\nnewly discovered phenomenon of concentration of flux lines at the cavity top\nleading to cavity equator temperature rise is presented.\n", "  We study the evolution of degenerate electron cores primarily composed of the\ncarbon burning products oxygen, neon, and magnesium (hereafter ONeMg cores)\nthat are undergoing compression. Electron capture reactions on A=20 and A=24\nisotopes reduce the electron fraction and heat the core. We develop and use a\nnew capability of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)\nstellar evolution code that provides a highly accurate implementation of these\nkey reactions. These new accurate rates and the ability of MESA to perform\nextremely small spatial zoning demonstrates a thermal runaway in the core\ntriggered by the temperature and density sensitivity of the Ne-20 electron\ncapture reactions. Both analytics and numerics show that this thermal runaway\ndoes not trigger core convection, but rather leads to a centrally concentrated\n(r < km) thermal runaway that will subsequently launch an oxygen deflagration\nwave from the center of the star. We use MESA to perform a parameter study that\nquantifies the influence of the magnesium mass fraction, the central\ntemperature, the compression rate, and uncertainties in the electron capture\nreaction rates on the ONeMg core evolution. This allows us to establish a lower\nlimit on the central density at which the oxygen deflagration wave initiates of\n$\\rho_c > 8.5 \\times 10^9\\, \\textrm{g cm}^{-3}$. Based on previous work and\norder-of-magnitude calculations, we expect objects which ignite oxygen at or\nabove these densities to collapse and form a neutron star. Calculations such as\nthese are an important step in producing more realistic progenitor models for\nstudies of the signature of accretion-induced collapse.\n", "  Recently the proof of factorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD\ncolor octet mechanism is given at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in\ncoupling constant by using diagrammatic method of QCD. In this paper we prove\nfactorization in heavy quarkonium production in NRQCD color octet mechanism at\nall order in coupling constant by using path integral method of QCD. Our proof\nis valid to all powers in the heavy quark relative velocity. We find that the\ngauge invariance and the factorization at all order in coupling constant\nrequire gauge-completed non-perturbative NRQCD matrix elements that were\nintroduced previously to prove factorization at NNLO.\n", "  Light-cone gauge formulation of fields in AdS space and conformal field\ntheory in flat space adapted for the study of AdS/CFT correspondence is\ndeveloped. Arbitrary spin mixed-symmetry fields in AdS space and arbitrary spin\nmixed-symmetry currents, shadows, and conformal fields in flat space are\nconsidered on an equal footing. For the massless and massive fields in AdS and\nthe conformal fields in flat space, simple light-cone gauge actions leading to\ndecoupled equations of motion are found. For the currents and shadows, simple\nexpressions for all 2-point functions are also found. We demonstrate that\nrepresentation of conformal algebra generators on space of currents, shadows,\nand conformal fields can be built in terms of spin operators entering the\nlight-cone gauge formulation of AdS fields. This considerably simplifies the\nstudy of AdS/CFT correspondence. Light-cone gauge actions for totally symmetric\narbitrary spin long conformal fields in flat space are presented. We apply our\napproach to the study of totally antisymmetric (one-column) and mixed-symmetry\n(two-column) fields in AdS space and currents, shadows, and conformal fields in\nflat space.\n", "  Standard methods for including electromagnetic interactions in lattice\nquantum chromodynamics calculations result in power-law finite-volume\ncorrections to physical quantities. Removing these by extrapolation requires\ncostly computations at multiple volumes. We introduce a photon mass to\nalternatively regulate the infrared, and rely on effective field theory to\nremove its unphysical effects. Electromagnetic modifications to the hadron\nspectrum are reliably estimated with a precision and cost comparable to\nconventional approaches that utilize multiple larger volumes. A significant\noverall cost advantage emerges when accounting for ensemble generation. The\nproposed method may benefit lattice calculations involving multiple charged\nhadrons, as well as quantum many-body computations with long-range Coulomb\ninteractions.\n", "  Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is a well-established technique\nfor enhancing Raman signals. Recently photonic integrated circuits have been\nused, as an alternative to microscopy based excitation and collection, to probe\nSERS signals from external metallic nanoparticles. However, in order to develop\nquantitative on-chip SERS sensors, integration of dedicated nanoplasmonic\nantennas and waveguides is desirable. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating\nfor the first time the generation of SERS signals from integrated bowtie\nnanoantennas, excited and collected by a single mode waveguide, and rigorously\nquantify the enhancement process. The guided Raman power generated by a\n4-Nitrothiophenol coated bowtie antenna shows an 8 x 10^6 enhancement compared\nto the free-space Raman scattering. An excellent correspondence is obtained\nbetween the theoretically predicted and observed absolute Raman power. This\nwork paves the way towards fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems where the\nsingle mode SERS-probe can be combined with other photonic, fluidic or\nbiological functionalities.\n", "  An exactly solvable spin-electron tetrahedral chain, where the Ising spins\nlocalized at nodal lattice sites regularly alternate with three equivalent\nlattice sites available for one mobile electron is considered. The system with\nferromagnetic interaction between the Ising spins and electrons exhibits an\nenhanced magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in the limit $H/|J|\\to 0$ when the entropy\nis very small, whereas the system with antiferromagnetic interaction between\nthe Ising spins and electrons exhibits an enhanced MCE around the field $H/J=1$\nwhen the entropy is sufficiently close to the value $S/2N =\n\\ln[(1+\\sqrt{5})/2]$. We study the thermodynamics of the system in these field\nregions.\n", "  Albatrosses can travel a thousand kilometers daily over the oceans. This feat\nis achieved through dynamic soaring, a non-flapping flight strategy where\npropulsive energy is extracted from horizontal wind shears. Dynamic soaring has\nbeen described as a sequence of half-turns connecting upwind climbs and\ndownwind dives through the surface shear layer. We analytically and numerically\ninvestigate the aerodynamically optimal flight trajectory for varying shear\nthicknesses. Contrary to current thinking, but consistent with GPS recordings\nof flying albatrosses, in thin shears the optimal trajectory is composed of\nsmall angle arcs. Essentially, the albatross is a flying sailboat, sequentially\nacting as sail and keel, and most efficient when remaining crosswind. Our\nanalysis constitutes a general framework for dynamic soaring, and more broadly\nenergy extraction in complex winds.\n", "  In this article we have developed the formalisms for the modified form of\nWien displacement laws for both the gas of electromagnetic waves and a gas of\nde Broglie waves in Rindler space. In the case of de Broglie waves we assume\nboth fermion type and boson type materials. Following the classic work of Wien,\nwe assume that the wall of the enclosure containing the photon gas or the gas\nof de Broglie waves, is expanding adiabatically with a uniform acceleration.\n", "  We show the positivity or negativity of truncated correlation functions in\nthe quantum XY model with spin 1/2 (at any temperature) and spin 1 (in the\nground state). These Griffiths-Ginibre inequalities of the second kind\ngeneralise an earlier result of Gallavotti.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality is a counterintuitive phenomenon that lies beyond the\npurview of causal influences. Recently, Bell inequalities have been generalized\nto the case of quantum inputs, leading to a powerful family of semi-quantum\nBell inequalities that are capable of detecting any entangled state. Here, we\nfocus on a different problem and investigate how the local-indistinguishability\nof quantum inputs and postselection may affect the requirements to detect\nsemi-quantum nonlocality. To this end, we consider a semi-quantum nonlocal game\nbased on locally-indistinguishable qubit inputs and derive its postselected\nlocal and quantum bounds by using a novel connection to the\nlocal-distinguishability of quantum states. Interestingly, we find that the\npostselected local bound is independent of the measurement efficiency and that\nthe Bell violation increases with lower measurement efficiencies.\n", "  The physicists of the early 20th century were unaware of two aspects which\nare vital to understanding some aspects of modern physics within classical\ntheory. The two aspects are: 1) the presence of classical electromagnetic\nzero-point radiation, and 2) the importance of special relativity. In classes\nin modern physics today, the problem of atomic collapse is still mentioned in\nthe historical context of the early 20th century. However, the classical\nproblem of atomic collapse is currently being treated in the presence of\nclassical zero-point radiation where the problem has been transformed. The\npresence of classical zero-point radiation indeed keeps the electron from\nfalling into the Coulomb potential center. However, the old collapse problem\nhas been replaced by a new problem where the zero-point radiation may give too\nmuch energy to the electron so as to cause self-ionization. Special relativity\nmay play a role in understanding this modern variation on the atomic collapse\nproblem, just as relativity has proved crucial for a classical understanding of\nblackbody radiation.\n", "  In this paper, an ultra-fast frequency shift-keying (FSK) modulation\ntechnique based on switched capacitor resonators is presented. It is\ndemonstrated that switching a reactive component such as a capacitor, in a\nhigh-Q resonator with proper switching signal can preserve the stored energy\nand shift it to a different frequency. Switching boundaries are found by\ncontinuity of electric charge and magnetic flux. It is shown that if switching\ntime is synchronous with zero crossing of the voltage signal across the\nswitched capacitor, impulsive components can be avoided and continuity of\nelectric charge is satisfied without energy dissipation. We use this property\nto realize a fast binary frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulator with only a\nsingle RF source. In this technique, the modulation rate is independent of the\nresonator bandwidth and can be as high as the lower carrier frequency.\nExperimental results are presented to validate the simulations.\n", "  High-precision laser spectroscopy of atomic energy levels enables the\nmeasurement of nuclear properties. Sensitivity to these properties is\nparticularly enhanced in muonic atoms which are bound systems of a muon and a\nnucleus. Exemplary is the measurement of the proton charge radius from muonic\nhydrogen performed by the CREMA collaboration which resulted in an order of\nmagnitude more precise charge radius as extracted from other methods but at a\nvariance of 7 standard deviations. Here, we summarize the role of muonic atoms\nfor the extraction of nuclear charge radii, we present the status of the so\ncalled \"proton charge radius puzzle\", and we sketch how muonic atoms can be\nused to infer also the magnetic nuclear radii, demonstrating again an\ninteresting interplay between atomic and particle/nuclear physics.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize the results of S. Oh (Physics Letters A. 644-647\n\\textbf{373 }) to Dzyaloshinski-Moriya model under nonuniform external magnetic\nfield to investigate the relation between entanglement, geometric phase (or\nBerry phase) and quantum phase transition. We use quaternionic representation\nto relate the geometric phase to the quantum phase transition. For small values\nof DM parameter, the Berry phase is more appropriate than the concurrence\nmeasure, while for large values, the concurrence is a good indicator to show\nthe phase transition. On the other hand, by increasing the DM interaction the\nphase transition occurs for large values of anisotropy parameter. In addition,\nfor small values of magnetic field the concurrence measure is appropriate\nindicator for quantum phase transition, but for large values of magnetic field\nthe Berry phase shows a sharp changes in the phase transition points. The\nresults show that the Berry phase and concurrence form a complementary system\nfrom phase transition point of view.\n", "  We theoretically give an infinite number of metastable crystal structures for\nthe superconducting sulfur hydride H$_{x}$S under pressure. It has been thought\nthat theoretically predicted structures of H$_{2}$S and H$_{3}$S exhibit low\nand high $T_{\\rm c}$ in the experiment, respectively. The newly found\nstructures are long-period modulated crystals where slab-like H$_{2}$S and\nH$_{3}$S regions intergrow in a microscopic scale. The extremely small\nformation enthalpy for the H$_{2}$S--H$_{3}$S boundary indicated with the\nfirst-principles calculations suggests possible alloying of these phases\nthrough formation of local H$_{3}$S regions. The modulated structures and\ngradual alloying transformations between them not only explain the peculiar\npressure dependence of $T_{\\rm c}$ in sulfur hydride observed experimentally,\nbut also could prevail in the experimental samples under various compression\nschemes.\n", "  High Energy Neutrino Astronomy has been revealed by a sudden change in the\nflavor composition around maximal energies since three years of recording in\nice km detector. However these discover didn' t led to any clear promised\nNeutrino Astronomy land yet. No correlation with hard gamma sources was found.\nMoreover the astrophysical spectra expected at Fermi value, seem to converge to\na softer value, also required to avoid any Glashow resonant neutrino signal. We\nsuggest a main solution within a composite flux ruled by prompt atmospheric\nneutrinos. Nevertheless the recent discover of twentyone crossing muons at\nhundreds TeVs had shown a first narrow overlapped doublet and a correlated\ntrack with a peculiar hard UHECR event clustering pointing to a well known\nmicrojet in bynary precession; these first connections hint for a non\nnegligible astrophysical component making neutrino astronomy anyway already\nmore than a hope.\n", "  Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are widely believed to be powered by\nthe mergers of compact binaries, such as binary neutron stars or possibly\nneutron star-black hole binaries. Though the prospect of detecting SGRBs with\ngravitational wave (GW) signals by the advanced Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)/VIRGO network is promising, no known SGRB\nhas been found within the expected advanced LIGO/VIRGO sensitivity range for\nbinary neutron star systems. We find, however, that the two long-short GRBs\n(GRB 060505 and GRB 060614) may be within the horizon of advanced GW detectors.\nIn the upcoming era of GW astronomy, the merger origin of some long-short GRBs,\nas favored by the macronova signature displayed in GRB 060614, can be\nunambiguously tested. The model-dependent time lags between the merger and the\nonset of the prompt emission of the GRB are estimated. The comparison of such\ntime lags between model predictions and the real data expected in the era of\nthe GW astronomy would be helpful in revealing the physical processes taking\nplace at the central engine (including the launch of the relativistic outflow,\nthe emergence of the outflow from the dense material ejected during the merger,\nand the radiation of gamma rays). We also show that the speed of GWs, with or\nwithout a simultaneous test of Einstein's equivalence principle, can be\ndirectly measured to an accuracy of $\\sim 3\\times 10^{-8}~{\\rm cm~s^{-1}}$ or\neven better in the advanced LIGO/VIRGO era. The Astrophysical Journal, Volume\n", "  We examine the repeatability, reliability, and accuracy of differential\nexoplanet eclipse depth measurements made using the InfraRed Array Camera\n(IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope during the post-cryogenic mission. We\nhave re-analyzed an existing 4.5 {\\mu}m data set, consisting of 10 observations\nof the XO-3b system during secondary eclipse, using seven different techniques\nfor removing correlated noise. We find that, on average, for a given technique,\nthe eclipse depth estimate is repeatable from epoch to epoch to within 156\nparts per million (ppm). Most techniques derive eclipse depths that do not vary\nby more than a factor 3 of the photon noise limit. All methods but one\naccurately assess their own errors: for these methods, the individual\nmeasurement uncertainties are comparable to the scatter in eclipse depths over\nthe 10 epoch sample. To assess the accuracy of the techniques as well as to\nclarify the difference between instrumental and other sources of measurement\nerror, we have also analyzed a simulated data set of 10 visits to XO-3b, for\nwhich the eclipse depth is known. We find that three of the methods (BLISS\nmapping, Pixel Level Decorrelation, and Independent Component Analysis) obtain\nresults that are within three times the photon limit of the true eclipse depth.\nWhen averaged over the 10 epoch ensemble, 5 out of 7 techniques come within 60\nppm of the true value. Spitzer exoplanet data, if obtained following current\nbest practices and reduced using methods such as those described here, can\nmeasure repeatable and accurate single eclipse depths, with close to\nphoton-limited results.\n", "  We develop a new model-independent method to probe the constancy of the speed\nof light $c$. In our method, the degeneracy between the cosmic curvature and\nthe speed of light can be eliminated, which makes the test more natural and\ngeneral. Combining the independent observations of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and\nluminosity distance $d_L(z)$, we use the model-independent smoothing technique,\nGaussian processes, to reconstruct them and then detect variation of the speed\nof light. We find no signal of deviation from the present value of the speed of\nlight $c_0$. Moreover, to demonstrate the improvement in probing the constancy\nof the speed of light from future experiments, we produce a series of simulated\ndata. The Dark Energy Survey will be able to detect $\\Delta c /c_0 \\sim 1\\%$ at\n$\\sim 1.5\\sigma$ confidence level and $\\Delta c /c_0 \\sim 2\\%$ at $\\sim\n3\\sigma$ confidence level. If the errors are reduced to one-tenth of the\nexpected DES ones, it can detect a $\\Delta c /c_0 \\sim 0.1\\%$ variation at\n$\\sim 2\\sigma$ confidence level.\n", "  Ultrafast laser measurements probe the non-equilibrium dynamics of excited\nelectrons in metals with increasing temporal resolution. Electronic structure\ncalculations can provide a detailed microscopic understanding of hot electron\ndynamics, but a parameter-free description of pump-probe measurements has not\nyet been possible, despite intensive research, because of the phenomenological\ntreatment of electron-phonon interactions. We present ab initio predictions of\nthe electron-temperature dependent heat capacities and electron-phonon coupling\ncoefficients of plasmonic metals. We find substantial differences from\nfree-electron and semi-empirical estimates, especially in noble metals above\ntransient electron temperatures of 2000 K, because of the previously-neglected\nstrong dependence of electron-phonon matrix elements on electron energy. We\nalso present first-principles calculations of the electron-temperature\ndependent dielectric response of hot electrons in plasmonic metals, including\ndirect interband and phonon-assisted intraband transitions, facilitating\ncomplete theoretical predictions of the time-resolved optical probe signatures\nin ultrafast laser experiments.\n", "  In low-collisionality plasmas, velocity-space instabilities are a key\nmechanism providing an effective collisionality for the plasma. We use\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the interplay between electron and\nion-scale velocity-space instabilities and their effect on electron pressure\nanisotropy, viscous heating, and thermal conduction. The adiabatic invariance\nof the magnetic moment in low-collisionality plasmas leads to pressure\nanisotropy, $p_{\\perp,j} > p_{||,j}$, if the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is\namplified ($p_{\\perp,j}$ and $p_{||,j}$ denote the pressure of species $j$\n[electron, ion] perpendicular and parallel to $\\vec{B}$). If the resulting\nanisotropy is large enough, it can in turn trigger small-scale plasma\ninstabilities. Our PIC simulations explore the nonlinear regime of the mirror,\nion-cyclotron, and electron whistler instabilities, through continuous\namplification of the magnetic field $|\\vec{B}|$ by an imposed shear in the\nplasma. In the regime $1 \\lesssim \\beta_j \\lesssim 20$ ($\\beta_j \\equiv 8\\pi\np_j/|\\vec{B}|^2$), the saturated electron pressure anisotropy, $\\Delta\np_e/p_{||,e}$, is determined mainly by the (electron-lengthscale) whistler\nmarginal stability condition, with a modest factor of $\\sim 1.5-2$ decrease due\nto the trapping of electrons by the mirrors. We explicitly calculate the mean\nfree path of the electrons and ions along the mean magnetic field and provide a\nsimple physical prescription for the mean free path and thermal conductivity in\nlow-collisionality $\\beta_j \\gtrsim 1$ plasmas. Our results imply that\nvelocity-space instabilities likely decrease the thermal conductivity of plasma\nin the outer parts of massive, hot, galaxy clusters. We also discuss the\nimplications of our results for electron heating and thermal conduction in\nlow-collisionality accretion flows onto black holes, including Sgr A* in the\nGalactic Center.\n", "  The merger-driven Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and their associated gravitational\nwave (GW) radiation, if both successfully detected, have some far-reaching\nimplications, including for instance: (i) The statistical comparison of the\nphysical properties of the short/long-short GRBs with and without GW detection\ncan test the general origin model; (ii) Revealing the physical processes taking\nplace at the central engine; (iii) Measuring the velocity of the Gravitational\nwave directly/accurately. In this work we discuss these implications in the\ncase of possible association of GW150914/ GBM transient 150914. We compared GBM\ntransient 150914 with other SGRBs and found that such an event {may be} a\ndistinct outlier in some statistical diagrams, possibly due to its specific\nbinary-black-hole merger origin. However, the presence of a \"new\" group of\nSGRBs with \"unusual\" physical parameters is also possible. If the outflow of\nGBM transient 150914 was launched by the accretion onto the nascent black hole,\nthe magnetic activity rather than the neutrino process is likely responsible\nfor the energy extraction and the accretion disk mass is estimated to be $\\sim\n10^{-5}~M_\\odot$. The GW150914/GBM transient 150914 association, {if confirmed,\nwould} provide the first opportunity to directly measure the GW velocity and\nits departure from the speed of the light {should be within} a factor of $\\sim\n10^{-17}$.\n", "  Glass sound velocity shift was observed to be longarithmically temperature\ndependent in both relaxation and resonance regimes: $\\Delta c/c=\\mathcal{C}\\ln\nT$. It does not monotonically increase with temperature from $T=0$K, but to\nreach a maximum around a few Kelvin. Different from tunneling-two-level-system\n(TTLS) which gives the slope ratio between relaxation and resonance regimes\n$\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm rel }:\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm res }=-\\frac{1}{2}:1$, we develop a\ngeneric coupled block model to give $\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm rel }:\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm\nres }=-1:1$, which agrees well with the majority of experimental measurements.\nWe use electric dipole-dipole interaction to carry out a similar behavior for\nglass dielectric constant shift $\\Delta \\epsilon/\\epsilon=\\mathcal{C}\\ln T$.\nThe slope ratio between relaxation and resonance regimes is $\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm\nrel}:\\mathcal{C}^{\\rm res}=1:-1$ which agrees with dielectric measurements\nquite well. By developing a renormalization procedure for non-elastic\nstress-stress and dielectric susceptibilities, we prove these universalities\nessentially come from $1/r^3$ long range interactions, independent of\nmaterials' microscopic properties.\n", "  Group-IV monochalcogenides are a family of two-dimensional puckered materials\nwith an orthorhombic structure that is comprised of polar layers. In this\narticle, we use first principles calculations to show the multistability of\nmonolayer SnS and GeSe, two prototype materials where the direction of the\npuckering can be switched by application of tensile stress or electric field.\nFurthermore, the two inequivalent valleys in momentum space, which are dictated\nby the puckering orientation, can be excited selectively using linearly\npolarized light, and this provides an additional tool to identify the\npolarization direction. Our findings suggest that SnS and GeSe monolayers may\nhave observable ferroelectricity and multistability, with potential\napplications in information storage.\n", "  We study collective modes of superfluid Bose gases in optical lattices at\ncommensurate fillings. We focus on the vicinity of the quantum phase transition\nto the Mott insulator, where there exists the Higgs amplitude mode in addition\nto the Nambu-Goldstone phase mode associated with the spontaneous U(1) symmetry\nbreaking. We analyze finite-temperature effects on the damping of the\ncollective modes by using an effective spin-1 model and the field theoretical\nmethods based on the finite-temperature Green's function. We calculate the\ndamping rates up to 1-loop order and evaluate them analytically and\nnumerically. We show that the damping rate of the Higgs mode increases with\nincreasing the temperature but it remains underdamped up to a typical\ntemperature achieved in experiments. Moreover, we find that the Nambu-Goldstone\nmode attenuates via a Landau damping process resulting from interactions with\nthe Higgs mode and it can be overdamped at the typical temperature in a certain\nparameter region.\n", "  Using trapped ion quantum bits in a scalable microfabricated surface trap, we\nperform the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Our architecture relies upon ion\ntransport and can readily be expanded to larger systems. The algorithm is\ndemonstrated using two- and three-ion chains. For three ions, an improvement is\nachieved compared to a classical system using the same number of oracle\nqueries. For two ions and one query, we correctly determine an unknown bit\nstring with probability 97.6(8)%. For three ions, we succeed with probability\n80.9(3)%.\n", "  The relation between the onset of chaos and critical phenomena, like Quantum\nPhase Transitions (QPT) and Excited-State Quantum Phase transitions (ESQPT), is\nanalyzed for atom-field systems. While it has been speculated that the onset of\nhard chaos is associated with ESQPT based in the resonant case, the\noff-resonant cases show clearly that both phenomena, ESQPT and chaos, respond\nto different mechanisms. The results are supported in a detailed numerical\nstudy of the dynamics of the semiclassical Hamiltonian of the Dicke model. The\nappearance of chaos is quantified calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent for\na wide sample of initial conditions in the whole available phase space for a\ngiven energy. The percentage of the available phase space with chaotic\ntrajectories is evaluated as a function of energy and coupling between the\nqubit and bosonic part, allowing to obtain maps in the space of coupling and\nenergy, where ergodic properties are observed in the model. Different sets of\nHamiltonian parameters are considered, including resonant and off-resonant\ncases.\n", "  We provide a description of the transverse momentum spectrum of single\ninclusive forward jets produced at the LHC, at the center-of-mass energies of 7\nand 13 TeV, using the high energy factorization (HEF) framework. We\nsubsequently study double inclusive forward jet production and, in particular,\nwe calculate contributions to azimuthal angle distributions coming from double\nparton scattering. We also compare our results for double inclusive jet\nproduction to those obtained with the Pythia Monte Carlo generator. This\ncomparison confirms that the HEF resummation acts like an initial state parton\nshower. It also points towards the need to include final state radiation\neffects in the HEF formalism.\n", "  We propose the fast semi-analytical method of modelling the polarization\ncurves in the voltammetric experiment. The method is based on usage of the\nspecial func- tions and shows a big calculation speed and a high accuracy and\nstability. Low computational needs of the proposed algorithm allow us to state\nthe set of Inverse Problems of voltammetry for the reconstruction of metal ions\nconcentrations or the other parameters of the electrolyte under investigation.\n", "  This letter presents a study of the inclusive production of X$\\rightarrow\nb\\bar{b}$ plus a recoil, using simulated samples of $pp$ collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV for an integrated luminosity in the range between 30\nfb$^{-1}$ to 3 ab$^{-1}$. The case for experiments to include un-prescaled\n$b$-tag multijet triggers for this topology is made and the ideal jet\nthresholds are discussed. The sensitivity to Standard Model Higgs with a\ntransverse momentum of at least 200 GeV is evaluated with respect to a\ncontinuous background, dominated by multijet processes. The mass of\n$b$-jet-pairs is analysed, quoting sensitivity to cross-sections in the range\nof 1 to 2 pb, for 100 fb$^{-1}$, covering the Higgs production cross section of\n1.8 pb. The trigger strategy presented in this letter is compared to triggers\nalready in use, showing an increase on the signal efficiency for masses below\n200 GeV and a performance comparable to a logic OR of all the currently\navailable akin triggers for higher masses. The robustness of the expected\nsensitivity against systematic uncertainties is estimated by considering\nvarious typical sources, such as those on the fitting parameters of the\ncontinuous background, shape uncertainties affecting the signal acceptance and\nthe background modelling. The accuracy of a Higgs production cross section\nmeasurements is also discussed, quoting sensitivity to deviations of 50% for\n100 fb$^{-1}$ and 10% for 3 ab$^{-1}$.\n", "  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of\ntwo identical yet independent, widely-separated, long-baseline\ngravitational-wave detectors. Each Advanced LIGO detector consists of complex\noptical-mechanical systems isolated from the ground by multiple layers of\nactive seismic isolation, all controlled by hundreds of fast, digital, feedback\ncontrol systems. This article describes a novel state machine-based automation\nplatform developed to handle the automation and supervisory control challenges\nof these detectors. The platform, called \\textit{Guardian}, consists of\ndistributed, independent, state machine automaton nodes organized\nhierarchically for full detector control. User code is written in standard\nPython and the platform is designed to facilitate the fast-paced development\nprocess associated with commissioning the complicated Advanced LIGO\ninstruments. While developed specifically for the Advanced LIGO detectors,\nGuardian is a generic state machine automation platform that is useful for\nexperimental control at all levels, from simple table-top setups to large-scale\nmulti-million dollar facilities.\n", "  A new protocol for measuring the branching fraction of hydrogenic atoms with\nonly statistically limited uncertainty is proposed and demonstrated for the\ndecay of the P$_{3/2}$ level of the barium ion, with precision below $0.5\\%$.\nHeavy hydrogenic atoms like the barium ion are test beds for fundamental\nphysics such as atomic parity violation and they also hold the key to\nunderstanding nucleo-synthesis in stars. To draw definitive conclusion about\npossible physics beyond the standard model by measuring atomic parity violation\nin the barium ion it is necessary to measure the dipole transition\nprobabilities of low-lying excited states with precision better than $1\\%$.\nFurthermore, enhancing our understanding of the $\\it{barium-puzzle}$ in barium\nstars requires branching fraction data for proper modelling of\nnucleo-synthesis. Our measurements are the first to provide a direct test of\nquantum many-body calculations on the barium ion with precision below one\npercent and more importantly with no known systematic uncertainties. The unique\nmeasurement protocol proposed here can be easily extended to any decay with\nmore than two channels and hence paves the way for measuring the branching\nfractions of other hydrogenic atoms with no significant systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  We initiate the investigation of the zero temperature holographic superfluids\nwith two competing orders, where besides the vacuum phase, two one band\nsuperfluid phases, the coexistent superfluid phase has also been found in the\nAdS soliton background for the first time. We construct the complete phase\ndiagram in the $e-\\mu$ plane by numerics, which is consistent with our\nqualitative analysis. Furthermore, we calculate the corresponding optical\nconductivity and sound speed by the linear response theory. The onset of pole\nof optical conductivity at $\\omega=0$ indicates that the spontaneous breaking\nphase always represents the superfluid phase, and the residue of pole is\nincreased with the chemical potential, which is consistent with the fact that\nthe particle density is essentially the superfluid density for zero temperature\nsuperfluids. In addition, the resulting sound speed demonstrates the\nnon-smoothness at the critical points as the order parameter of condensate,\nwhich indicates that the phase transitions can also be identified by the\nbehavior of sound speed. Moreover, as expected from the boundary conformal\nfield theory, the sound speed saturates to $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ at the large\nchemical potential limit for our two band holographic superfluid model.\n", "  Angular momentum transport in magnetic multilayered structures plays a\ncentral role in spintronic physics and devices. The angular momentum currents\nor spin currents are carried by either quasi-particles such as electrons and\nmagnons, or by macroscopic order parameters such as local magnetization of\nferromagnets. Based on the generic interface exchange interaction, we develop a\nmicroscopic theory that describes interfacial spin conductance for various\ninterfaces among non-magnetic metals, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\ninsulators. Spin conductance and its temperature dependence are obtained for\ndifferent spin batteries including spin pumping, temperature gradient and spin\nHall effect. As an application of our theory, we calculate the spin current in\na trilayer made of a ferromagnetic insulator, an antiferromagnetic insulator\nand a non-magnetic heavy metal. The calculated results on the temperature\ndependence of spin conductance quantitatively agree with the existing\nexperiments.\n", "  The SAMpler for PICosecond time (SAMPIC) chip has been designed by a\ncollaboration including CEA/IRFU/SEDI, Saclay and CNRS/LAL/SERDI, Orsay. It\nbenefits from both the quick response of a time to digital converter and the\nversatility of a waveform digitizer to perform accurate timing measurements.\nThanks to the sampled signals, smart algorithms making best use of the pulse\nshape can be used to improve time resolution. A software framework has been\ndeveloped to analyse the SAMPIC output data and extract timing information by\nusing either a constant fraction discriminator or a fast cross-correlation\nalgorithm. SAMPIC timing capabilities together with the software framework have\nbeen tested using pulses generated by a signal generator or by a silicon\ndetector illuminated by a pulsed infrared laser. Under these ideal experimental\nconditions, the SAMPIC chip has proven to be capable of timing resolutions down\nto 4 ps with synthesized signals and 40 ps with silicon detector signals.\n", "  Symmetry and magnitude of spin-orbit torques (SOT), i.e., current-induced\ntorques on the magnetization of systems lacking inversion symmetry, are\ninvestigated in a fully relativistic linear response framework based on the\nKubo formalism. By applying all space-time symmetry operations contained in the\nmagnetic point group of a solid to the relevant response coefficient, the\ntorkance expressed as torque-current correlation function, restrictions to the\nshape of the direct and inverse response tensors are obtained. These are shown\nto apply to the corresponding thermal analogues as well, namely the direct and\ninverse thermal SOT in response to a temperature gradient or heat current.\nUsing an implementation of the Kubo-Bastin formula for the torkance into a\nfirst-principles multiple-scattering Green's function framework and accounting\nfor disorder effects via the so-called coherent potential approximation (CPA),\nall contributions to the SOT in pure systems, dilute as well as concentrated\nalloys can be treated on equal footing. This way, material specific values for\nall torkance tensor elements in the fcc (111) trilayer alloy system Pt |\nFe$_x$Co$_{1-x}$ | Cu are obtained over a wide concentration range and\ndiscussed in comparison to results for electrical and spin conductivity, as\nwell as to previous work - in particular concerning symmetry w.r.t.\nmagnetization reversal and the nature of the various contributions.\n", "  If neutrinos get mass via the seesaw mechanism the mixing matrix describing\nneutrino oscillations can be effectively non-unitary. We show that in this case\nthe neutrino appearance probabilities involve a new CP phase, phi, associated\nto non-unitarity. This leads to an ambiguity in extracting the \"standard\"\nthree--neutrino phase delta_CP, which can survive even after neutrino and\nantineutrino channels are combined. Its existence should be taken into account\nin the planning of any oscillation experiment aiming at a robust measurement of\ndelta_CP.\n", "  We study the duality between four-dimensional N=2 compactifications of\nheterotic and type IIA string theories. Via adiabatic fibration of the duality\nin six dimensions, type IIA string theory compactified on a K3-fibred\nCalabi-Yau threefold has a potential heterotic dual compactification. This\nadiabatic picture fails whenever the K3 fibre degenerates into multiple\ncomponents over points in the base of the fibration. Guided by monodromy, we\nidentify such degenerate K3 fibres as solitons generalizing the NS5-brane in\nheterotic string theory. The theory of degenerations of K3 surfaces can then be\nused to find which solitons can be present on the heterotic side. Similar to\nsmall instanton transitions, these solitons escort singular transitions between\ndifferent Calabi-Yau threefolds. Starting from well-known examples of\nheterotic--type IIA duality, such transitions can take us to type IIA\ncompactifications with unknown heterotic duals.\n", "  Self-testing refers to the phenomenon that certain extremal quantum\ncorrelations (almost) uniquely identify the quantum system under consideration.\nFor instance observing the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality certifies\nthat the two parties share a singlet. While self-testing results are known for\nseveral classes of states, in many cases they are only applicable if the\nobserved statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for\npractical applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less\ncommon and moreover they all result from a single numerical method (with one\nexception which we discuss in detail). In this work we present a new technique\nfor proving analytic self-testing bounds of practically relevant robustness. We\nobtain improved bounds for the case of self-testing the singlet using the CHSH\ninequality (in particular we show that non-trivial fidelity with the singlet\ncan be achieved as long as the violation exceeds $\\beta^{*} = (16 + 14\n\\sqrt{2})/17 \\approx 2.11$). In case of self-testing the tripartite GHZ state\nusing the Mermin inequality we derive a bound which not only improves on\npreviously known results but turns out to be tight. We discuss other scenarios\nto which our technique can be immediately applied.\n", "  The Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, wherein the dark matter is treated as a\npressureless perfect fluid, provides a good fit to galactic and cosmological\ndata. With the advent of precision cosmology, it should be asked whether this\nsimplest model needs to be extended, and whether doing so could improve our\nunderstanding of the properties of dark matter. One established\nparameterisation for generalising the CDM fluid is the Generalised Dark Matter\n(GDM) model, in which dark matter is an imperfect fluid with pressure and shear\nviscosity that fulfill certain closure equations. We investigate these closure\nequations and the three new parametric functions they contain: the background\nequation of state w, the speed of sound c_s^2 and the viscosity c_{vis}^2.\nTaking these functions to be constant parameters, we analyse an exact solution\nof the perturbed Einstein equations in a GDM-dominated universe and discuss the\nmain effects of the three parameters on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).\nOur analysis suggests that the CMB alone is not able to distinguish between the\nGDM sound speed and viscosity parameters, but that other observables, such as\nthe matter power spectrum, are required to break this degeneracy. We also\nconsider other descriptions of imperfect fluids that have a non-perturbative\ndefinition and relate these to the GDM model. In particular, we consider scalar\nfields, an effective field theory (EFT) of fluids, an EFT of Large Scale\nStructure, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and tightly-coupled fluids. These\ndescriptions could be used to extend the GDM model into the nonlinear regime of\nstructure formation, which is necessary if the wealth of data available on\nthose scales is to be employed in constraining the model. We also derive the\ninitial conditions for adiabatic and isocurvature perturbations and provide the\nresult in a form ready for implementation in Einstein-Boltzmann solvers.\n", "  The spontaneous localization mechanism of collapse models induces a Brownian\nmotion in all physical systems. This effect is very weak, but experimental\nprogress in creating ultracold atomic systems can be used to detect it. In this\npaper, we considered a recent experiment [1], where an atomic ensemble was\ncooled down to picokelvins. Any Brownian motion induces an extra increase of\nthe position variance of the gas. We study this effect by solving the dynamical\nequations for the Continuous Spontaneous Localizations (CSL) model, as well as\nfor its non-Markovian and dissipative extensions. The resulting bounds, with a\n95% of confidence level, are beaten only by measurements of spontaneous X-ray\nemission and by experiments with cantilever (in the latter case, only for rC >\n10^(-7) m, where rC is one of the two collapse parameters of the CSL model). We\nshow that, contrary to the bounds given by X-ray measurements, non-Markovian\neffects do not change the bounds, for any reasonable choice of a frequency\ncutoff in the spectrum of the collapse noise. Therefore the bounds here\nconsidered are more robust. We also show that dissipative effects are\nunimportant for a large spectrum of temperatures of the noise, while for low\ntemperatures the excluded region in the parameter space is the more reduced,\nthe lower the temperature.\n", "  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a prototypical multi-band superconductor with three bands\ncrossing the Fermi level. These bands exhibit distinct dimensional\ncharacteristics, with one quasi-2D $\\gamma$-band and two quasi-1D $\\alpha$- and\n$\\beta$-bands. This leads to the expectation that the superconductivity on the\n$\\gamma$-band may be only weakly Josephson-coupled to that on the other two\nbands. Based on an explicit microscopic weak coupling calculation appropriate\nfor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study the collective Leggett modes associated with the\nrelative phase oscillations between the bands and show that a relatively soft\nLeggett mode exists due to the comparatively weaker inter-band Josephson\ncoupling. These calculations also provide insight into why the superconducting\ngap magnitudes may be comparable on all three bands, despite the noticeable\ndifferences between the $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha, \\beta$ bands. The analyses can be\nreadily applied to other multi-band superconductors.\n", "  We study the 7x7 Hagen-Hurley equations describing spin 1 particles. We split\nthese equations, in the interacting case, into two Dirac equations with\nnon-standard solutions. It is argued that these solutions describe decay of a\nvirtual W boson in beta decay.\n", "  We derive the spectra arising from non-relativistic dark matter annihilations\nor decays into intermediary particles with arbitrary spin, which subsequently\nproduce neutrinos or photons via two-body decays. Our approach is model\nindependent and predicts spectral features restricted to a kinematic box. The\noverall shape within that box is a polynomial determined by the polarization of\nthe decaying particle. We illustrate our findings with two examples. First,\nwith the neutrino spectra arising from dark matter annihilations into the\nmassive Standard Model gauge bosons. Second, with the gamma-ray and neutrino\nspectra generated by dark matter annihilations into hypothetical massive spin-2\nparticles. Our results are in particular applicable to the 750 GeV diphoton\nexcess observed at the LHC if interpreted as a spin-0 or spin-2 particle\ncoupled to dark matter. We also derive limits on the dark matter annihilation\ncross section into this resonance from the non-observation of the associated\ngamma-ray spectral features by the H.E.S.S. telescope.\n", "  In continuum models of dislocations, proper formulations of short-range\nelastic interactions of dislocations are crucial for capturing various types of\ndislocation patterns formed in crystalline materials. In this article, the\ncontinuum dynamics of straight dislocations distributed on two parallel slip\nplanes is modelled through upscaling the underlying discrete dislocation\ndynamics. Two continuum velocity field quantities are introduced to facilitate\nthe discrete-to-continuum transition. The first one is the local migration\nvelocity of dislocation ensembles which is found fully independent of the\nshort-range dislocation correlations. The second one is the decoupling velocity\nof dislocation pairs controlled by a threshold stress value, which is proposed\nto be the effective flow stress for single slip systems. Compared to the almost\nubiquitously adopted Taylor relationship, the derived flow stress formula\nexhibits two features that are more consistent with the underlying discrete\ndislocation dynamics: i) the flow stress increases with the in-plane component\nof the dislocation density only up to a certain value, hence the derived\nformula admits a minimum inter-dislocation distance within slip planes; ii) the\nflow stress smoothly transits to zero when all dislocations become\ngeometrically necessary dislocations. A regime under which inhomogeneities in\ndislocation density grow is identified, and is further validated through\ncomparison with discrete dislocation dynamical simulation results. Based on the\nfindings in this article and in our previous works, a general strategy for\nincorporating short-range dislocation correlations in continuum models of\ndislocations is proposed.\n", "  Recently, the existence of massless chiral (Weyl) fermions has been\npostulated in a class of semi-metals with a non-trivial energy dispersion.These\nmaterials are now commonly dubbed Weyl semi-metals (WSM).One predicted property\nof Weyl fermions is the chiral or Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, a chirality\nimbalance in the presence of parallel magnetic and electric fields. In WSM, it\nis expected to induce a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NMR), the\nchiral magnetic effect.Here, we present experimental evidence that the\nobservation of the chiral magnetic effect can be hindered by an effect called\n\"current jetting\". This effect also leads to a strong apparent NMR, but it is\ncharacterized by a highly non-uniform current distribution inside the sample.\nIt appears in materials possessing a large field-induced anisotropy of the\nresistivity tensor, such as almost compensated high-mobility semimetals due to\nthe orbital effect.In case of a non-homogeneous current injection, the\npotential distribution is strongly distorted in the sample.As a consequence, an\nexperimentally measured potential difference is not proportional to the\nintrinsic resistance.Our results on the MR of the WSM candidate materials NbP,\nNbAs, TaAs, TaP exhibit distinct signatures of an inhomogeneous current\ndistribution, such as a field-induced \"zero resistance' and a strong dependence\nof the `measured resistance\" on the position, shape, and type of the voltage\nand current contacts on the sample. A misalignment between the current and the\nmagnetic-field directions can even induce a \"negative resistance\".\nFinite-element simulations of the potential distribution inside the sample,\nusing typical resistance anisotropies, are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings. Our study demonstrates that great care must be taken\nbefore interpreting measurements of a NMR as evidence for the chiral anomaly in\nputative Weyl semimetals.\n", "  The one-dimensional Ising spin-glass model with power-law long-range\ninteractions is a useful proxy model for studying spin glasses in higher space\ndimensions and for finding the dimension at which the spin-glass state changes\nfrom having broken replica symmetry to that of droplet behavior. To this end we\nhave calculated the exponent that describes the difference in free energy\nbetween periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions. Numerical work is done\nto support some of the assumptions made in the calculations and to determine\nthe behavior of the interface free-energy exponent of the power law of the\ninteractions. Our numerical results for the interface free-energy exponent are\nbadly affected by finite-size problems.\n", "  Previous work has demonstrated that the radio frequency surface resistance of\nniobium resonators is dramatically reduced when nitrogen impurities are\ndissolved as interstitial in the material. The origin of this effect is\nattributed to the lowering of the Mattis and Bardeen surface resistance\ncontribution with increasing accelerating field. Meanwhile, an enhancement of\nthe sensitivity to trapped magnetic field is typically observed for such\ncavities. In this paper we conduct the first systematic study on these\ndifferent components contributing to the total surface resistance as a function\nof different levels of dissolved nitrogen, in comparison with standard surface\ntreatments for niobium resonators. Adding these results together we are able to\nshow for the first time which is the optimum surface treatment that maximizes\nthe Q-factor of superconducting niobium resonators as a function of expected\ntrapped magnetic field in the cavity walls. These results also provide new\ninsights on the physics behind the change in the field dependence of the Mattis\nand Bardeen surface resistance, and of the trapped magnetic vortex induced\nlosses in superconducting niobium resonators.\n", "  Through the development of a parallel code called TMSWIFT, an extensive\nlight-front quantization study of the nonperturbative spectrum of the bound\nstate $(\\mu^+\\mu^-)$, true muonium, has been performed. Using Pad\\'{e}\napproximants, it has been possible to extract continuum and infinite-cutoff\nlimits for the singlet and triplet states for a range of values of the coupling\nconstant $\\alpha$. This data set allows for an investigation of the $\\alpha$\ndependence of the light-front spectra, the results of which are compared to\nstandard calculations. Decay constants have also been obtained. Improved\ncalculations have been undertaken for the energy shifts due to the presence of\na second, lighter flavor ($e$). Finally, initial results for three-flavor ($e$,\n$\\mu$, $\\tau$) calculations are presented.\n", "  Diffusive motion of regulatory enzymes on biopolymers with eventual capture\nat a reaction site is a common feature in cell biology. Using a lattice gas\nmodel we study the impact of diffusion and capture for a microtubule polymerase\nand a depolymerase. Our results show that the capture mechanism localizes the\nproteins and creates large-scale spatial correlations. We develop an analytic\napproximation that globally accounts for relevant correlations and yields\nresults that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. Our results\nshow that diffusion and capture operates most efficiently at cellular enzyme\nconcentrations which points to in vivo relevance.\n", "  In this paper, which is the first in a series of papers associated with\ncataclysmic variables and related objects, we introduce the CATUABA code, a\nnumerical machinery written for analysis of the MOCCA simulations, and show\nsome first results by investigating the present-day population of cataclysmic\nvariables in globular clusters. Emphasis was given on their properties and the\nobservational selection effects when observing and detecting them. In this work\nwe analysed in this work six models, including three with Kroupa distributions\nof the initial binaries. We found that for models with Kroupa initial\ndistributions, considering the standard value of the efficiency of the common\nenvelope phase adopted in BSE, no single cataclysmic variable was formed only\nvia binary stellar evolution, i. e., in order to form them, strong dynamical\ninteractions have to take place. We show and explain why this is inconsistent\nwith observational and theoretical results. Our results indicate that the\npopulation of cataclysmic variables in globular clusters is, mainly, in the\nlast stage of their evolution and observational selection effects can\ndrastically change the expected number of observed cataclysmic variables. We\nshow that the probability of observing them during the outbursts is extremely\nsmall and conclude that the best way of looking for cataclysmic variables in\nglobular clusters is by searching for variabilities during quiescence, instead\nof during outbursts. For that, one would need a very deep observation which\ncould reach magnitudes $\\gtrsim$ 27 mag. Finally, we argue that cataclysmic\nvariables in globular clusters are not necessarily magnetic.\n", "  We show by first-principles calculations that the skew-scattering anomalous\nHall and spin-Hall angles of L$1_0$-ordered FePt drastically depend on\ndifferent types of disorder. A different sign of the AHE is obtained when\nslightly deviating from the stoichiometric ratio towards the Fe-rich side as\ncompared to the Pt-rich side. For stoichiometric samples, short-range ordering\nof defects has a profound effect on the Hall angles and can change them by a\nfactor of $2$ as compared to the case of uncorrelated disorder. This might\nexplain the vast range of anomalous Hall angles measured in experiments, which\nundergo different preparation procedures and thus might differ in their\ncrystallographic quality.\n", "  In this paper, inspired by the ultraviolet deformation of the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker geometry in loop quantum cosmology, we\nformulate an infrared-modified cosmological model. We obtain the associated\ndeformed Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we show that the late time\ncosmic acceleration can be addressed by the infrared corrections. As a\nparticular example, we applied the setup to the case of matter dominated\nuniverse. This model has the same number of parameters as $\\Lambda$CDM, but a\ndynamical dark energy generates in the matter dominated era at the late time.\nAccording to our model, as the universe expands, the energy density of the cold\ndark matter dilutes and when the Hubble parameter approaches to its minimum,\nthe infrared effects dominate such that the effective equation of state\nparameter smoothly changes from $w_{_{\\rm eff}}=0$ to $w_{_{\\rm eff}}=-2$.\nInterestingly and nontrivially, the unstable de Sitter phase with $w_{_{\\rm\neff}}=-1$ is corresponding to $\\Omega_m=\\Omega_d =0.5$ and the universe crosses\nthe phantom divide from the quintessence phase with $w_{_{\\rm eff}}>-1$ and\n$\\Omega_m> \\Omega_d$ to the phantom phase with $w_{_{\\rm eff}}<-1$ and $\n\\Omega_m<\\Omega_d$ which shows that the model is observationally viable. The\nresults show that the universe finally ends up in a big rip singularity for a\nfinite time proportional to the inverse of the minimum of the Hubble parameter.\nMoreover, we consider the dynamical stability of the model and we show that the\nuniverse starts from the matter dominated era at the past attractor with\n$w_{_{\\rm eff}}=0$ and ends up in a future attractor at the big rip with\n$w_{_{\\rm eff}}=-2$.\n", "  We introduce a novel scheme for efficient manipulation and detection of\nterahertz (THz) radiation. Our work consists of two parts; with a focus on\nproving the concept of our novel scheme, and the exploitation of graphene's\npeculiar properties.\n  For the first part, we report on the successful demonstration of two\nmultiresonance Split Ring Resonator (SRR) designs, for efficient modulation of\nTHz frequency beams. The two designs are based on SRR intracoupling, with\nmultiple predefined resonances covering the bandwidth 40-300 GHz. The\nsimulation results obtained have been experimentally verified.\n  The second part of the work reports on the computational development of novel\narchitectures of low-impedance broadband antennas, for efficient detection of\nTHz frequency beams. The conceived Split Ring Resonator-Resonance Assisted\n(SRR-RA) antennas are based on both a capacitive and inductive scheme,\nexploiting a 200 $\\Omega$ and 400 $\\Omega$ impedance, respectively. Moreover,\nthe impedance is tunable by varying the geometry's coupling parameters,\nallowing for better matching with the detector circuit for maximum power\nextraction. Our results have been obtained at simulation level for a 1.5 THz\noperation frequency.\n", "  We investigate the product form uncertainty relations of variances for\n$n\\,(n\\geq 3)$ quantum observables. In particular, tight uncertainty relations\nsatisfied by three observables has been derived, which is shown to be better\nthan the ones derived from the strengthened Heisenberg and the generalized\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger uncertainty relations, and some existing uncertainty relation\nfor three spin-half operators. Uncertainty relation of arbitrary number of\nobservables is also derived. As an example, the uncertainty relation satisfied\nby the eight Gell-Mann matrices is presented.\n", "  Brief introduction to the theory of surface phase transitions at planar\ninterfaces, such as wetting phenomena (in Czech).\n", "  The emerging field of Nominal Computation Theory is concerned with the theory\nof Nominal Sets and its applications to Computer Science. We investigate here\nthe impact of nominal sets on the definition of Cellular Automata and on their\ncomputational capabilities, with a special focus on the emergent behavioural\nproperties of this new model and their significance in the context of\ncomputation-oriented interpretations of physical phenomena. A preliminary\ninvestigation of the relations between Nominal Cellular Automata and Wolfram's\nElementary Cellular Automata is also carried out.\n", "  The key kinetic barrier to dolomite formation is related to the surface\nMg2+-H2O complex, which hinders binding of surface Mg2+ ions to the CO3 2- ions\nin solution. It has been proposed that this reaction can be catalyzed by\ndissolved hydrogen sulfide. To characterize the role of dissolved hydrogen\nsulfide in the dehydration of surface Mg 2+ ions, ab initio simulations based\non density functional theory (DFT) were carried out to study the thermodynamics\nof competitive adsorption of hydrogen sulfide and water on dolomite (104)\nsurfaces from solution. We find that water is thermodynamically more stable on\nthe surface with the difference in adsorption energy of -13.6 kJ/mol (in\nvacuum) and -12.8 kJ/mol (in aqueous solution). However, aqueous hydrogen\nsulfide adsorbed on the surface increases the Mg2+-H2O distances on surrounding\nsurface sites. Two possible mechanisms were proposed for the catalytic effects\nof adsorbed hydrogen sulfide on the anhydrous Ca-Mg-carbonate crystallization\nat low temperature.\n", "  An interface between an oxide and an electrolyte gives rise to various\nprocesses as exemplified by electrostatic charge accumulation/depletion and\nelectrochemical reactions such as intercalation/decalation under electric\nfield. Here we directly compare typical device operations of those in electric\ndouble layer transistor geometry by adopting ${A}$-site vacant perovskite\nWO$_3$ epitaxial thin films as a channel material and two different\nelectrolytes as gating agent. $\\textit{In situ}$ measurements of x-ray\ndiffraction and channel resistance performed during the gating revealed that in\nboth the cases WO$_3$ thin film reaches a new metallic state through multiple\nphase transitions, accompanied by the change in out-of-plane lattice constant.\nElectrons are electrostatically accumulated from the interface side with an\nionic liquid, while alkaline metal ions are more uniformly intercalated into\nthe film with a polymer electrolyte. We systematically demonstrate this\ndifference in the electrostatic and electrochemical processes, by comparing\ndoped carrier density, lattice deformation behavior, and time constant of the\nphase transitions.\n", "  Dehydration of water from surface Mg2+ is most likely the rate-limiting step\nin the dolomite growth at low temperature. Here, we investigate the role of\npolysaccharide in this step using classical molecular dynamics (MD)\ncalculations. Free energy (potential of mean force, PMF) calculations have been\nperformed for water molecules leaving the first two hydration layers above the\ndolomite (104) surface under the following three conditions: without catalyst,\nwith monosaccharide (mannose) and with oligosaccharide (three units of\nmannose). MD simulations reveal that there is no obvious effect of\nmonosaccharide in lowering the dehydration barrier for surface Mg2+. However,\nwe found that there are metastable configurations of oligosaccharide, which can\ndecrease the dehydration barrier of surface Mg2+ by about 0.7-1.1 kcal/mol. In\nthese configurations, the molecule lies relatively flat on the surface and\nforms a bridge shape. The hydrophobic space near the surface created by the\nnon-polar -CH groups of the oligosaccharide in the bridge conformation is the\nreason for the observed reduction of dehydration barrier.\n", "  Nano-precipitates with tripled periodicity along the c-axis are observed in a\nCa-rich dolomite sample from Proterozoic carbonate rocks with \"molar tooth\"\nstructure. This observation is consistent with previous description of d\nreflections. High-angle annular dark-field STEM imaging (or Z-contrast imaging)\nthat avoids dynamic diffraction as seen in electron diffraction and\nhigh-resolution TEM imaging modes, confirms that d reflections correspond to\nnanoscale precipitates aligned parallel to (001) of the host dolomite. The\nlamellae precipitates have a cation ordering sequence of Ca-Ca-Mg-Ca-Ca- Mg\nalong the c direction resulting in a chemical composition of Ca0.67Mg0.33CO3.\nThis superstructure is attributed to the extra or d reflections, thus is\nreferred to as the d superstructure in this study. The structure can be simply\ndescribed as interstratified calcite/dolomite. The crystal structure of the d\nsuperstructure calculated from density functional theory (DFT) has a space\ngroup of P31c and has a and c unit-cell parameters of 4.879 and 16.260 {\\AA},\nrespectively, values between those of dolomite and calcite. The detailed\nstructural characteristics and parameters obtained from ab initio calculations\nare also reported in this paper. The method of combining Z-contrast imaging and\nab initio calculations can be used for solving structures of other\nnano-precipitates and nano-phases.\n", "  Dolomite crystals in partially dolomitized limestone from the Platteville\nFormation are both compositionally and microstructurally heterogeneous. A\nsingle dolomite crystal usually contains three phases: the host Ca-rich\ndolomite [Ca1.14Mg0.86(CO3)2], an Fe-bearing dolomite\n[Ca1.06Mg0.80Fe0.14(CO3)2], and calcite inclusions. These three phases show\nsimilar orientations. The Ca-rich dolomite exhibits modulated microstructures\nwith wavelength ranging from 7 to 30 nm. The modulated microstructures are not\nevident in Fe-bearing dolomite. Modulations in the Ca-rich dolomite have three\npredominant orientation ranges in the studied sample: from (205) to (104), from\n(001) to (-101), and ~(110), which are consistent with previous studies.\nBright-field (BF) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images confirm that\nthese modulations are due to chemical variation rather than strain or\ndiffraction contrast. The Ca-rich lamellae are Mg-rich calcite with\ncompositions ranging from Ca0.85Mg0.15CO3 to Ca0.70Mg0.30CO3. The observed\nresults indicate that these Ca-rich exsolution lamellae formed during\ndiagenesis. In this study, three kinds of \"c\"-reflections, which are weak spots\nin the halfway position between the principal reflections along the (104)*,\n(112)*, and (110)* directions, have been found in the diffraction patterns of\nsome Ca-rich dolomite. Mg-Ca ordering in x-y planes was not observed directly\nin Z-contrast images. FFT patterns from the Z-contrast images do not show\n\"c\"-reflections. STEM images confirm that the \"c\"-reflections could result from\nmultiple diffraction between the host dolomite and twinned Mg-calcite\nnano-lamellae under TEM imaging and diffraction modes.\n", "  We review recent developments in the use of magnetic lattices as a\ncomplementary tool to optical lattices for trapping periodic arrays of\nultracold atoms and degenerate quantum gases. Recent advances include the\nrealisation of Bose-Einstein condensation in multiple sites of a magnetic\nlattice of one-dimensional microtraps, the trapping of ultracold atoms in\nsquare and triangular magnetic lattices, and the fabrication of magnetic\nlattice structures with sub-micron period suitable for quantum tunnelling\nexperiments. Finally, we describe a proposal to utilise long-range interacting\nRydberg atoms in a large spacing magnetic lattice to create interactions\nbetween atoms on neighbouring sites.\n", "  In this Note, a new approach to spacecraft positioning based on GGT inversion\nis presented. The gravity gradient tensor is initially measured in the\ngradiometer reference frame (GRF) and then transformed to the Earth-Centered\nEarth-Fixed (ECEF) frame via attitude information as well as Earth rotation\nparameters. Matrix Eigen-Decomposition is introduced to directly translate GGT\ninto position based on the fact that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of GGT\nare simplespecific functions of spherical coordinates of the observation\nposition. without the need of an initial position. Unlike the strategy of\ninertial navigation aiding, no prediction or first guess of the spacecraft\nposition is needed. The method makes use of the J2 gravity model, and is\nsuitable for space navigation where higher frequency terrain contributions to\nthe GGT signals can be neglected.\n", "  An innovative orbit determination method which makes use of gravity gradients\nfor Low-Earth-Orbiting satellites is proposed. The measurement principle of\ngravity gradiometry is briefly reviewed and the sources of measurement error\nare analyzed. An adaptive hybrid least squares batch filter based on\nlinearization of the orbital equation and unscented transformation of the\nmeasurement equation is developed to estimate the orbital states and the\nmeasurement biases. The algorithm is tested with the actual flight data from\nthe European Space Agency Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation\nExplorer. The orbit determination results are compared with the GPS-derived\norbits. The radial and cross-track position errors are on the order of tens of\nmeters, whereas the along-track position error is over one order of magnitude\nlarger. The gravity gradient based orbit determination method is promising for\npotential use in GPS-denied spacecraft navigation.\n", "  To date X-ray spectroscopy has become a routine tool that can reveal highly\nlocal and element-specific information on the electronic structure of atoms in\ncomplex environments. Here, we focus on nuclear dynamical effects in X-ray\nspectra and develop a rigorous time-correlation method employing ground state\nmolecular dynamics simulations. The importance of nuclear correlation phenomena\nis demonstrated by comparison against the results from the conventional\nsampling approach for gas phase water. In contrast to the first-order\nabsorption, second-order resonant inelastic scattering spectra exhibit\npronounced fingerprints of nuclear motions. The developed methodology does not\ndepend on the accompanying electronic structure method in principle as well as\non the spectral range and, thus, can be applied to, e.g., UV and X-ray\nphoto-electron and Auger spectroscopies.\n", "  The intensities and profiles of the muon beam behind the beam dump of the\nFermilab test beam area when the facility is running in the \"pion\" beam mode\nare measured and summarized in this note. This muon beam with momenta in the\nrange 10 - 50 GeV/c provides an opportunity to perform various measurements in\nparallel with other users of the test beam area.\n", "  Many particle accelerators operate with very high beam power and very high\nenergy stored in particle beams as well as in magnet systems. In the future,\nthe beam power in high intensity accelerators will further increase. The\nprotection of the accelerator equipment from the consequences of uncontrolled\nrelease of the energy is essential. This was the motivation for organizing a\nfirst school on beam losses and accelerator protection (in general referred to\nas machine protection). During the school the methods and technologies to\nidentify, mitigate, monitor and manage the technical risks associated with the\noperation of accelerators with high-power beams or subsystems with large stored\nenergy were presented. At the completion of the school the participants should\nhave been able to understand the physical phenomena that can damage machine\nsubsystems or interrupt operations and to analyze an accelerator facility to\nproduce a register of technical risks and the corresponding risk mitigation and\nmanagement strategies.\n", "  The confirmation of the Higgs boson in Run I data at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) and the excesses in recent Run II data suggest scenarios beyond\nthe Standard Model (SM). We pursue a study in a minimal model which is an\nextension of a scalar doublet in the SM known as two-Higgs doublet model\n(THDM). Following earlier suggestions two real scalars $\\chi$ and $S$ have been\nintroduced in the THDM where $\\chi$ is treated as a candidate for dark matter.\n$\\chi$ does not receive any vacuum expectation value ($vev$) in the model\nwhereas the Higgs-like scalar $S$ acquires $vev$. This allows small mixing\nbetween the $CP$-even scalars of the THDM, $h$, $H$ and $S$. In this study the\nmass spectrum of new scalars is taken to be $2 m_h < m_H < 2 m_t$, $m_\\chi <\nm_h/2$, $m_h \\lesssim m_S \\lesssim m_H - m_h$, $m_A > 2 m_t$ and $m_H^\\pm <\nm_A$, where $m_h$ and $m_t$ is masses of the SM Higgs and top-quark\nrespectively, $m_H, m_A$ and $m_{H^\\pm}$ are the masses of the heavy $CP$-even\nscalar $H$, $CP$-odd scalar $A$, and charged Higgs $H^\\pm$, respectively. A\npartial list of potential search channels at the LHC has been provided with\npossible phenomenological consequences. The expected phenomenology and\nconstraints on parameters are also discussed in a model-independent approach .\n", "  Neuronal avalanches measured in vitro and in vivo in different cortical\nnetworks consistently exhibit power law behaviour for the size and duration\ndistributions with exponents typical for a mean field self-organized branching\nprocess. These exponents are also recovered in neuronal network simulations\nimplementing various neuronal dynamics on different network topologies. They\ncan therefore be considered a very robust feature of spontaneous neuronal\nactivity. Interestingly, this scaling behaviour is also observed on regular\nlattices in finite dimensions, which raises the question about the origin of\nthe mean field behaviour observed experimentally. In this study we provide an\nanswer to this open question by investigating the effect of activity dependent\nplasticity in combination with the neuronal refractory time in a neuronal\nnetwork. Results show that the refractory time hinders backward avalanches\nforcing a directed propagation. Hebbian plastic adaptation plays the role of\nsculpting these directed avalanche patterns into the topology of the network\nslowly changing it into a branched structure where loops are marginal.\n", "  The complete orientational ordering tensor of quasi-ideal colloidal rods is\nobtained as a function of shear rate by performing rheo-SANS (rheology with\nsmall angle neutron scattering) measurements on isotropic fd-virus suspensions\nin the two relevant scattering planes, the flow-gradient (1-2) and the\nflow-vorticity (1-3) plane. Microscopic ordering can be identified as the\norigin of the observed shear thinning. A qualitative description of the\nrheological response by Smoluchowski, as well as Doi--Edwards--Kuzuu theory is\npossible, as we obtain a master curve for different concentrations, scaling the\nshear rate with the apparent collective rotational diffusion coefficient.\nHowever, the observation suggests that the interdependence of ordering and\nshear thinning at small shear rates is stronger than predicted. The extracted\nzero-shear viscosity matches the concentration dependence of the self-diffusion\nof rods in semi-dilute solutions, while the director tilts close towards the\nflow direction already at very low shear rates. In contrast, we observe a\nsmaller dependence on the shear rate in the overall ordering at high shear\nrates, as well as an ever-increasing biaxiality.\n", "  We study the simplest possible model of nanocrystal consisting in a simple\ncubic lattice with a small number of atoms (NA ~ 10-10^3), where each atom is\nlinked to its nearest neighbor by a quantum harmonic potential. Some properties\n(entropy, temperature, specific heat) of the nanocrystal are calculated\nnumerically but exactly within the framework of the microcanonical ensemble. We\nfind that the presence of a surface in the nanocrystal modifies the\nthermostatistic properties to a greater extent than the small number of atoms\nin the system. The specific heat Cv behaves similarly to the Einstein solid,\nwith an asymptotic value for high temperatures that differs from that of the\nDulong-Petit law by a term of the order of NA^(-1/3) and that can be explained\neasily in terms of the surface. The entropy is non-additive, but this is due to\nthe presence of the surface and we show that the additivity is recovered in the\nthermodynamic limit. Finally, we find that, when calculations follow the\ncanonical ensemble, results differ little for small systems (NA = 27) and are\ninexistent for larger systems (NA = 1000).\n", "  We investigate the secular dynamics of three-body circumbinary systems under\nthe effect of tides. We use the octupolar non-restricted approximation for the\norbital interactions, general relativity corrections, the quadrupolar\napproximation for the spins, and the viscous linear model for tides. We derive\nthe averaged equations of motion in a simplified vectorial formalism, which is\nsuitable to model the long-term evolution of a wide variety of circumbinary\nsystems in very eccentric and inclined orbits. In particular, this vectorial\napproach can be used to derive constraints for tidal migration, capture in\nCassini states, and stellar spin-orbit misalignment. We show that circumbinary\nplanets with initial arbitrary orbital inclination can become coplanar through\na secular resonance between the precession of the orbit and the precession of\nthe spin of one of the stars. We also show that circumbinary systems for which\nthe pericenter of the inner orbit is initially in libration present chaotic\nmotion for the spins and for the eccentricity of the outer orbit. Because our\nmodel is valid for the non-restricted problem, it can also be applied to any\nthree-body hierarchical system such as star-planet-satellite systems and triple\nstellar systems.\n", "  A well-known optimal velocity (OV) model describes vehicle motion along a\nsingle lane road, which reduces to a perturbed modified Korteweg-de Vries\n(mKdV) equation within the unstable regime. Steady travelling wave solutions to\nthis equation are then derived with a multi-scale perturbation technique. The\nfirst order solution in the hierarchy is written in terms of slow and fast\nvariables. At the following order, a system of differential equations are\nhighlighted that govern the slowly evolving properties of the leading solution.\nThen, it is shown that the critical points of this system signify travelling\nwaves without slow variation. As a result, a family of steady waves with\nconstant amplitude and period are identified. When periodic boundary conditions\nare satisfied, these solutions' parameters are associated with the driver's\nsensitivity, $\\hat{a}$, which appears in the OV model. For some given\n$\\hat{a}$, solutions of both an upward and downward form exist, with the\ndownward type corresponding to traffic congestion. Numerical simulations are\nused to validate the asymptotic analysis and also to examine the long-time\nbehaviour of our solutions.\n", "  Currently operating gravitational-wave interferometers are Michelson\ninterferometers with effective arm length L ~ 4x10e5 m. While the\ninterferometer remains in lock, data at the fsr sideband frequency encode\ninformation on slow phase changes in the f ~ 10e-5 Hz range, with a fringe\nsensitivity ~ 10e-10. Preliminary LIGO data presented in 2009 show no Lorentz\nviolating signal at the second harmonic of the Earth's sidereal frequency. This\nsets a limit on a possible change in refractine index, dn/n < 2x10e-22, an\nimprovement of more than three orders of magnitude over existing limits.\n", "  A femtosecond pump-probe setup is described that is optimised for broadband\ntransient reflectivity experiments on solid samples over a wide range of\ntemperatures. By combining a temporal resolution of 45 fs and a broad detection\nrange between 1.75 and 2.85 eV, this apparatus can provide insightful\ninformation on the interplay between coherent collective modes and high-energy\nelectronic excitations, which is one of the distinctive characteristics of\nstrongly interacting and correlated quantum systems. The use of a single-shot\nreadout CMOS array detector at frame rates up to 10 kHz allows to resolve\ncoherent oscillations with amplitudes below 10$^{-4}$ in $\\Delta$R/R. We\ndemonstrate the operation of this setup on the prototypical charge-transfer\ninsulator La$_2$CuO$_4$, revealing the presence of coherent optical phonons\nwith frequencies as high as 13 THz.\n", "  Solving the mystery of the origin of chondrules is one of the most elusive\ngoals in the field of meteoritics. Recently the idea of planet(esimal)\ncollisions releasing splashes of lava droplets, long considered out of favor,\nhas been reconsidered as a possible origin of chondrules by several papers. One\nof the main problems with this idea is the lack of quantitative and simple\nmodels that can be used to test this scenario by directly comparing to the many\nknown observables of chondrules. In Paper I of this series we presented a\nsimple thermal evolution model of a spherically symmetric expanding cloud of\nmolten lava droplets that is assumed to emerge from a collision between two\nplanetesimals. In the present paper, number II of this series, we use this\nmodel to calculate whether or not volatile elements such as Na and K will\nremain abundant in these droplets or whether they will get depleted due to\nevaporation. The high density of the droplet cloud (e.g. small distance between\nadjacent droplets) causes the vapor to quickly reach saturation pressure and\nthus shutting down further evaporation. We show to which extent, and under\nwhich conditions, this keeps the abundances of these elements high, as is seen\nin chondrules. We find that for most parameters of our model (cloud mass,\nexpansion velocity, initial temperature) the volatile elements Mg, Si and Fe\nremain entirely in the chondrules. The Na and K abundances inside the droplets\nwill initially stay mostly at their initial values due to the saturation of the\nvapor pressure, but at some point start to drop due to the cloud expansion.\nHowever, as soon as the temperature starts to decrease, most or all of the\nvapor recondenses again. At the end the Na and K elements retain most of their\ninitial abundances, albeit occasionally somewhat reduced, depending on the\nparameters of the expanding cloud model.\n", "  The spin projection of a massive particle onto its direction of motion is\ncalled helicity (or \"handedness\"). It can therefore be positive or negative.\nWhen a particle's helicity changes from positive to negative (or vice-versa)\ndue to its interaction with other particles or fields, we say there is a\nhelicity flip. In this work we show that such helicity flip can be seen for an\nelectron of $20 MeV$ of energy interacting with a charged scalar meson through\nthe exchange of a virtual photon. This photon {\\it does not} necessarily need\nto be Podolsky's proposed photon; in fact, it is independent of it.\n", "  Using first principles density functional theory calculations, we show how\nRashba-type energy band splitting in the hybrid organic-inorganic halide\nperovskites APbX$_3$ (A=CH$_3$NH$_3^+$, CH(NH$_2$)$_2^+$, Cs$^+$ and X=I, Br)\ncan be tuned and enhanced with electric fields and anisotropic strain. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the Rashba splitting of\ntetragonal (CH$_3$NH$_3$)PbI$_3$ grows with increasing macroscopic alignment of\nthe organic cations and electric polarization, indicating appreciable\ntunability with experimentally-feasible applied fields, even at room\ntemperature. Further, we quantify the degree to which this effect can be tuned\nvia chemical substitution at the A and X sites, which alters amplitudes of\ndifferent polar distortion patterns of the inorganic PbX$_3$ cage that directly\nimpact Rashba splitting. In addition, we predict that polar phases of CsPbI$_3$\nand (CH$_3$NH$_3$)PbI$_3$ with $R3c$ symmetry possessing considerable Rashba\nsplitting might be accessible at room temperature via anisotropic strain\ninduced by epitaxy, even in the absence of electric fields.\n", "  The aim of the present study is to simulate the interaction between the solar\nwind and the Hermean magnetosphere. We use the MHD code PLUTO in spherical\ncoordinates with an axisymmetric multipolar expansion of the Hermean magnetic\nfield, to perform a set of simulations with different interplanetary magnetic\nfield orientations and intensities. We fix the hydrodynamic parameters of the\nsolar wind to study the distortions driven by the interplanetary magnetic field\nin the topology of the Hermean magnetosphere, leading to variations of the mass\nand energy deposition distributions, the integrated mass deposition, the oval\naperture, the area covered by open magnetic field lines and the regions of\nefficient particle sputtering on the planet surface. The simulations show a\ncorrelation between the reconnection regions and the local maxima of plasma\ninflow and energy deposition on the planet surface.\n", "  We present an atomistic model of pillared DNA nanotubes (DNTs) and their\nelastic properties which will facilitate further studies of these nanotubes in\nseveral important nanotechnological and biological applications. In particular,\nwe introduce a computational design to create an atomistic model of a 6-helix\nDNT (6HB) along with its two variants, 6HB flanked symmetrically by two double\nhelical DNA pillars (6HB+2) and 6HB flanked symmetrically by three double\nhelical DNA pillars (6HB+3). Analysis of 200 ns all-atom simulation\ntrajectories in the presence of explicit water and ions shows that these\nstructures are stable and well behaved in all three geometries. Hydrogen\nbonding is well maintained for all variants of 6HB DNTs. We calculate the\npersistence length of these nanotubes from their equilibrium bend angle\ndistributions. The values of persistence length are ~10 {\\mu}m, which is 2\norders of magnitude larger than that of dsDNA. We also find a gradual increase\nof persistence length with an increasing number of pillars, in quantitative\nagreement with previous experimental findings. To have a quantitative\nunderstanding of the stretch modulus of these tubes we carried out\nnonequilibrium Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD). The linear part of the force\nextension plot gives stretch modulus in the range of 6500 pN for 6HB without\npillars which increases to 11,000 pN for tubes with three pillars. The values\nof the stretch modulus calculated from contour length distributions obtained\nfrom equilibrium MD simulations are similar to those obtained from\nnonequilibrium SMD simulations. The addition of pillars makes these DNTs very\nrigid.\n"]}
