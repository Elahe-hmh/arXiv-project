"10.1103/PhysRevA.88.010301"], "abstract": ["  In this Reply to the preceding Comment of Klimchitskaya and Mostepanenko (cf.\nalso quant-ph/0703214), we summarize and maintain our position that the Drude\ndispersion relation when inserted in the Lifshitz formula gives a\nthermodynamically satisfactory description of the Casimir force, also in the\nlimiting case when the relaxation frequency goes to zero (perfect crystals).\n", "  We consider a family of surfaces of revolution ranging between a disc and a\nhemisphere, that is spherical caps. For this family, we study the spectral\ndensity in the ray limit and arrive at a trace formula with geodesic polygons\ndescribing the spectral fluctuations. When the caps approach the hemisphere the\nspectrum becomes equally spaced and highly degenerate whereas the derived trace\nformula breaks down. We discuss its divergence and also derive a different\ntrace formula for this hemispherical case. We next turn to perturbative\ncorrections in the wave number where the work in the literature is done for\neither flat domains or curved without boundaries. In the present case, we\ncalculate the leading correction explicitly and incorporate it into the\nsemiclassical expression for the fluctuating part of the spectral density. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first calculation of such perturbative\ncorrections in the case of curvature and boundary.\n", "  We provide evidence for the existence of a {\\em quantum critical point} at\nthe metallization of magnetite Fe$_{3}$O$_{4}$ at an applied pressure of $p_{c}\n\\approx 8$ GPa. We show that the present ac magnetic susceptibility data\nsupport earlier resistivity data. The Verwey temperature scales with pressure\n$T_{V}\\sim (1-p/p_{c})^{\\nu}$, with $\\nu\\sim 1/3$. The resistivity data shows a\ntemperature dependence $\\rho(T)=\\rho_{0}+AT^{n}$, with $n\\simeq 3$ above and\n2.5 at the critical pressure, respectively. This difference in $n$ with\npressure is a sign of critical behavior at $p_{c}$. The magnetic susceptibility\nis smooth near the critical pressure, both at the Verwey transition and near\nthe ferroelectric anomaly. A comparison with the critical behavior observed in\nthe Mott-Hubbard and related systems is made.\n", "  Third-order bound-charge electronic nonlinearities of Si nanocrystals (NCs)\nembedded in a wide band-gap matrix representing silica are theoretically\nstudied using an atomistic pseudopotential approach. Nonlinear refractive\nindex, two-photon absorption and optical switching parameter are examined from\nsmall clusters to NCs up to a size of 3 nm. Compared to bulk values, Si NCs\nshow higher third-order optical nonlinearities and much wider two-photon\nabsorption threshold which gives rise to enhancement in the optical switching\nparameter.\n", "  In a unifying way, the doorway mechanism explains spectral properties in a\nrich variety of open mesoscopic quantum systems, ranging from atoms to nuclei.\nA distinct state and a background of other states couple to each other which\nsensitively affects the strength function. The recently measured superscars in\nthe barrier billiard provide an ideal model for an in--depth investigation of\nthis mechanism. We introduce two new statistical observables, the full\ndistribution of the maximum coupling coefficient to the doorway and directed\nspatial correlators. Using Random Matrix Theory and random plane waves, we\nobtain a consistent understanding of the experimental data.\n", "  One-armed oscillation modes in the circumstellar discs of Be stars may\nexplain the cyclical variations in their emission lines. We show that a\nthree-dimensional effect, involving vertical motion and neglected in previous\ntreatments, profoundly influences the dynamics. Using a secular theory of\neccentric discs that reduces the problem to a second-order differential\nequation, we show that confined prograde modes are obtained for all reasonable\ndisc temperatures and stellar rotation rates. We confirm these results using a\nnumerical analysis of the full set of linearized equations for\nthree-dimensional isothermal discs including viscous terms that couple the\nhorizontal motions at different altitudes. In order to make these modes grow,\nviscous damping must be overcome by an excitation mechanism such as viscous\noverstability.\n", "  We investigate the structure of gapless edge modes propagating at the\nboundary of some fractional quantum Hall states. We show how to deduce explicit\ntrial wavefunctions from the knowledge of the effective theory governing the\nedge modes. In general quantum Hall states have many edge states. Here we\ndiscuss the case of fractions having only two such modes. The case of\nspin-polarized and spin-singlet states at filling fraction 2/5 is considered.\nWe give an explicit description of the decoupled charged and neutral modes.\nThen we discuss the situation involving negative flux acting on the composite\nfermions. This happens notably for the filling factor 2/3 which supports two\ncounterpropagating modes. Microscopic wavefunctions for spin-polarized and\nspin-singlet states at this filling factor are given. Finally we present an\nanalysis of the edge structure of a non-Abelian state involving also negative\nflux. Counterpropagating modes involve in all cases explicit derivative\noperators diminishing the angular momentum of the system.\n", "  A measurement of the inclusive ep scattering cross section is presented in\nthe region of low momentum transfers, 0.2 GeV^2 < Q^2 < 12 GeV^2, and low\nBjorken x, 5x10^-6 < x < 0.02. The result is based on two data sets collected\nin dedicated runs by the H1 Collaboration at HERA at beam energies of 27.6 GeV\nand 920 GeV for positrons and protons, respectively. A combination with data\npreviously published by H1 leads to a cross section measurement of a few\npercent accuracy. A kinematic reconstruction method exploiting radiative ep\nevents extends the measurement to lower Q^2 and larger x. The data are compared\nwith theoretical models which apply to the transition region from\nphotoproduction to deep inelastic scattering.\n", "  The dynamics of two-dimensional viscous vesicles in shear flow, with\ndifferent fluid viscosities $\\eta_{\\rm in}$ and $\\eta_{\\rm out}$ inside and\noutside, respectively, is studied using mesoscale simulation techniques.\nBesides the well-known tank-treading and tumbling motions, an oscillatory\nswinging motion is observed in the simulations for large shear rate. The\nexistence of this swinging motion requires the excitation of higher-order\nundulation modes (beyond elliptical deformations) in two dimensions.\nKeller-Skalak theory is extended to deformable two-dimensional vesicles, such\nthat a dynamical phase diagram can be predicted for the reduced shear rate and\nthe viscosity contrast $\\eta_{\\rm in}/\\eta_{\\rm out}$. The simulation results\nare found to be in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, when\nthermal fluctuations are incorporated in the theory. Moreover, the hydrodynamic\nlift force, acting on vesicles under shear close to a wall, is determined from\nsimulations for various viscosity contrasts. For comparison, the lift force is\ncalculated numerically in the absence of thermal fluctuations using the\nboundary-integral method for equal inside and outside viscosities. Both methods\nshow that the dependence of the lift force on the distance $y_{\\rm {cm}}$ of\nthe vesicle center of mass from the wall is well described by an effective\npower law $y_{\\rm {cm}}^{-2}$ for intermediate distances $0.8 R_{\\rm p}\n\\lesssim y_{\\rm {cm}} \\lesssim 3 R_{\\rm p}$ with vesicle radius $R_{\\rm p}$.\nThe boundary-integral calculation indicates that the lift force decays\nasymptotically as $1/[y_{\\rm {cm}}\\ln(y_{\\rm {cm}})]$ far from the wall.\n", "  Clusters of galaxies are believed to be capable to accelerate protons at\naccretion shocks to energies exceeding 10^18 eV. At these energies, the losses\ncaused by interactions of cosmic rays with photons of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground Radiation (CMBR) become effective and determine the maximum energy\nof protons and the shape of the energy spectrum in the cutoff region. The aim\nof this work is the study of the formation of the energy spectrum of\naccelerated protons at accretion shocks of galaxy clusters and of the\ncharacteristics of their broad band emission. The proton energy distribution is\ncalculated self-consistently via a time-dependent numerical treatment of the\nshock acceleration process which takes into account the proton energy losses\ndue to interactions with the CMBR. We calculate the energy distribution of\naccelerated protons, as well as the flux of broad-band emission produced by\nsecondary electrons and positrons via synchrotron and inverse Compton\nscattering processes. We find that the downstream and upstream regions\ncontribute almost at the same level to the emission. For the typical parameters\ncharacterising galaxy clusters, the synchrotron and IC peaks in the spectral\nenergy distributions appear at comparable flux levels. For an efficient\nacceleration, the expected emission components in the X-ray and gamma-ray band\nare close to the detection threshold of current generation instruments, and\nwill be possibly detected with the future generation of detectors.\n", "  We develop an approximate model for the process of direct (nonsequential)\ntwo-photon double ionization of atoms. Employing the model, we calculate\n(generalized) total cross sections as well as energy-resolved differential\ncross sections of helium for photon energies ranging from 39 to 54 eV. A\ncomparison with results of \\textit{ab initio} calculations reveals that the\nagreement is at a quantitative level. We thus demonstrate that this complex\nionization process is fully described by the simple model, providing insight\ninto the underlying physical mechanism. Finally, we use the model to calculate\ngeneralized cross sections for the two-photon double ionization of neon in the\nnonsequential regime.\n", "  We examine quantum statistics of optical photons emitted from atomic\nensembles which are classically driven and simultaneously coupled to a\ntwo-level atom via microwave photon exchange. Quantum statistics and\ncorrelations are analyzed by calculating second order coherence degree, von\nNeumann entropy, spin squeezing for multi-particle entanglement, as well as\ngenuine two and three-mode entanglement parameters for steady state and\nnon-equilibrium situations. Coherent transfer of population between the\nradiation modes and quantum state mapping between the two-level atom and the\noptical modes are discussed. A potential experimental realization of the\ntheoretical results in a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator\ncontaining diamond crystals with Nitrogen-Vacancy color centers and a\nsuperconducting artificial two-level atom is discussed.\n", "  An ionization front expanding into a neutral medium can be slowed-down\nsignificantly by recombinations. In cosmological numerical simulations the\nrecombination rate is often computed using a 'clumping factor', that takes into\naccount that not all scales in the simulated density field are resolved. Here\nwe demonstrate that using a single value of the clumping factor significantly\noverestimates the recombination rate, and how a local estimate of the clumping\nfactor is both easy to compute, and gives significantly better numerical\nconvergence. We argue that this lower value of the recombination rate is more\nrelevant during the reionization process and hence that the importance of\nrecombinations during reionization has been overestimated.\n", "  We report first-principles density-functional theory studies of native point\ndefects and defect complexes in olivine-type LiFePO4, a promising candidate for\nrechargeable Li-ion battery electrodes. The defects are characterized by their\nformation energies which are calculated within the GGA+U framework. We find\nthat native point defects are charged, and each defect is stable in one charge\nstate only. Removing electrons from the stable defects always generates defect\ncomplexes containing small hole polarons. Defect formation energies, hence\nconcentrations, and defect energy landscapes are all sensitive to the choice of\natomic chemical potentials which represent experimental conditions. One can,\ntherefore, suppress or enhance certain native defects in LiFePO4 via tuning the\nsynthesis conditions. Based on our results, we provide insights on how to\nobtain samples in experiments with tailored defect concentrations for targeted\napplications. We also discuss the mechanisms for ionic and electronic\nconduction in LiFePO4 and suggest strategies for enhancing the electrical\nconductivity.\n", "  Recent Fermi and VERITAS observations of the prototypical Type Ia supernova\nremnant (SNR) Tycho have discovered gamma-rays with energies E in the range\nfrom ~0.4 GeV to 10 TeV. Crucial for the theory of Galactic cosmic-ray origin\nis whether the gamma-rays from SNRs are produced by accelerated hadrons\n(protons and ions), or by relativistic electrons. Here we show that the\nbroadband radiation spectrum of Tycho can be explained within the framework of\na two-zone leptonic model, which is likely to apply to every SNR. A model with\nhadrons can also fit the radiation spectrum. The hadronic origin of gamma-rays\ncan be confirmed by Fermi spectral measurements of Tycho and other SNRs at\nenergies below ~300 MeV.\n", "  We propose a concrete experiment to probe the non-equilibrium local dynamics\nof the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using a trapped ion system consisting\nof a linear chain of few Ba^+ ions prepared in a state of transverse motional\nmode which corresponds to a fixed number of phonons per ion. These phonons are\nwell-known to be described by an effective Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a\nprotocol which leads to a sudden local sign reversal of the on-site interaction\nstrength of this Hubbard model at one of the sites and demonstrate that the\nsubsequent non-equilibrium dynamics of the model can be experimentally probed\nby measuring the time-dependent phonon number in a specific motional state of\nthe Ba+ ions. We back our experimental proposal with exact numerical\ncalculation of the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model subsequent to a local\nquench.\n", "  We consider certain boundary conditions supporting soliton solutions in the\ngeneralized non-linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation (AKNS$_r$)\\,($r=1,2$). Using\nthe dressing transformation (DT) method and the related tau functions we study\nthe AKNS$_{r}$ system for the vanishing, (constant) non-vanishing and the mixed\nboundary conditions, and their associated bright, dark, and bright-dark\nN-soliton solutions, respectively. Moreover, we introduce a modified DT related\nto the dressing group in order to consider the free field boundary condition\nand derive generalized N-dark-dark solitons. As a reduced submodel of the\nAKNS$_r$ system we study the properties of the focusing, defocusing and mixed\nfocusing-defocusing versions of the so-called coupled non-linear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation ($r-$CNLS), which has recently been considered in many\nphysical applications. We have shown that two$-$dark$-$dark$-$soliton bound\nstates exist in the AKNS$_2$ system, and three$-$ and\nhigher$-$dark$-$dark$-$soliton bound states can not exist. The\nAKNS$_r$\\,($r\\geq 3$) extension is briefly discussed in this approach. The\nproperties and calculations of some matrix elements using level one vertex\noperators are outlined.\n", "  We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including a\nself-consistent treatment for inhomogeneous reionisation to study the impact of\ngalactic outflows and photoionisation heating on the volume-averaged\nrecombination rate of the intergalactic medium (IGM). By incorporating an\nevolving ionising escape fraction and a treatment for self-shielding within\nLyman limit systems, we have run the first simulations of \"photon-starved\"\nreionisation scenarios that simultaneously reproduce observations of the\nabundance of galaxies, the optical depth to electron scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background photons \\tau, and the effective optical depth to\nLyman\\alpha absorption at z=5. We confirm that an ionising background reduces\nthe clumping factor C by more than 50% by smoothing moderately-overdense\n(\\Delta=1--100) regions. Meanwhile, outflows increase clumping only modestly.\nThe clumping factor of ionised gas is much lower than the overall baryonic\nclumping factor because the most overdense gas is self-shielded.\nPhotoionisation heating further suppresses recombinations if reionisation heats\ngas above the canonical 10,000 K. Accounting for both effects within our most\nrealistic simulation, C rises from <1 at z>10 to 3.3 at z=6. We show that\nincorporating temperature- and ionisation-corrected clumping factors into an\nanalytical reionisation model reproduces the numerical simulation's \\tau to\nwithin 10%. Finally, we explore how many ionising photons are absorbed during\nthe process of heating filaments by considering the overall photon cost of\nreionisation in analytical models that assume that the IGM is heated at\ndifferent redshifts. For reionisation redshifts of 9--10, cold filaments boost\nthe reionisation photon budget by ~1 photon per hydrogen atom.\n", "  We consider the higher-order gravity theory derived from the quadratic\nlagrangian $R+\\epsilon R^2$ in vacuum as a first-order (ADM-type) system with\nconstraints, and build time developments of solutions of an initial value\nformulation of the theory. We show that all such solutions, if analytic,\ncontain the right number of free functions to qualify as general solutions of\nthe theory. We further show that any regular analytic solution which satisfies\nthe constraints and the evolution equations can be given in the form of an\nasymptotic formal power series expansion.\n", "  Effect of Gaussian random magnetic field distribution which is centered at\nzero on the phase transition properties of isotropic quantum Heisenberg model\nhas been investigated on two (2D) and three dimensional (3D) lattices within\nthe framework of effective field theory (EFT) for a two spin cluster (which is\nabbreviated as EFT-2). Beside the phase diagrams and the evolution of the\nmagnetization versus temperature curves with the Gaussian magnetic field\ndistribution width, critical Gaussian distribution width values, which make the\ncritical temperature zero, have been obtained for several lattices. Moreover,\nit has been concluded that all critical temperatures are of the second order\nand reentrant behavior does not exist in the phase diagrams.\n", "  We consider gauge theories from the free evolution point of view, in which\ninitial data satisfying constraints of a theory are given. Because the\nconstraints are compatible with the field equations they remain so. We study a\nmodel constrained Hamiltonian theory and identify a particular structure in the\nequations of motion which we call the standard gauge freedom. The pure gauge\nsubsystem of this model theory is identified and the manner in which the gauge\nvariables couple to the field equations is presented. We demonstrate that the\nset of gauge choices that can be coupled to the field equations to obtain a,\nproperly defined, wave-like formulation is exactly the set of wave-like pure\ngauges. Consequently we analyze a parametrized family of formulations of\ngeneral relativity. The generalization of the harmonic gauge formulation to a\nfive parameter family of gauge conditions is obtained.\n", "  Associated to any manifold equipped with a closed form of degree >1 is an\n`L-infinity algebra of observables' which acts as a higher/homotopy analog of\nthe Poisson algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold. In order to study\nLie group actions on these manifolds, we introduce a theory of homotopy moment\nmaps. Such a map is a L-infinity morphism from the Lie algebra of the group\ninto the observables which lifts the infinitesimal action. We establish the\nrelationship between homotopy moment maps and equivariant de Rham cohomology,\nand analyze the obstruction theory for the existence of such maps. This allows\nus to easily and explicitly construct a large number of examples. These include\nresults concerning group actions on loop spaces and moduli spaces of flat\nconnections. Relationships are also established with previous work by others in\nclassical field theory, algebroid theory, and dg geometry. Furthermore, we use\nour theory to geometrically construct various L-infinity algebras as higher\ncentral extensions of Lie algebras, in analogy with Kostant's quantization\ntheory. In particular, the so-called `string Lie 2-algebra' arises this way.\n", "  Observations of very low-mass stars with Kepler represent an excellent\nopportunity to search for planetary transits and to characterize optical\nphotometric variability at the cool end of the stellar mass distribution. In\nthis paper, we present low-resolution red optical spectra that allow us to\nidentify 18 very low-mass stars that have Kepler light curves available in the\npublic archive. Spectral types of these targets are found to lie in the range\ndM4.5--dM8.5, implying spectrophotometric distances from 17 pc to 80 pc. Limits\nto the presence of transiting planets are placed from modelling of the Kepler\nlight curves. We find that the size of the planets detectable by Kepler around\nthese small stars typically lie in the range 1 to 5 Earth radii within the\nhabitable regions (P$\\le$10 days). We identify one candidate transit with a\nperiod of 1.26 days that resembles the signal produced by a planet slightly\nsmaller than the Moon. However, our pixel by pixel analysis of the Kepler data\nshows that the signal most likely arises from a background contaminating\neclipsing binary. For 11 of these objects reliable photometric periods shorter\nthan 7 days are derived, and are interpreted as rotational modulation of\nmagnetic cool spots. For 3 objects we find possible photometric periods longer\nthan 50 days that require confirmation. H$_\\alpha$ emission measurements and\nflare rates are used as a proxies for chromospheric activity and transversal\nvelocities are used as an indicator of dynamical ages. These data allow us to\ndiscuss the relationship between magnetic activity and detectability of\nplanetary transits around very low-mass stars. We show that Super-Earth planets\nwith sizes around 2 Earth radii are detectable with Kepler around about two\nthirds of the stars in our sample, independently from their level of\nchromospheric activity.\n", "  We consider the stability of systems subjected to periodic parametric driving\nsuch that their equations of motion are ordinary differential equations with\nperiodic coefficients and carry out a detailed analysis of important aspects of\nsuch systems in the context of the confinement of ions by oscillating electric\nfields. We show how they can be understood in terms of a pseudopotential\napproximation and resonances arising from the parametric excitation and\ninvestigate the properties of a novel linear Paul trap configuration operating\nwith two radio-frequencies to simultaneously confine two species with extremely\ndifferent charge-to-mass ratios. The theoretical calculations have been\nverified by molecular dynamics simulations and normal modes analysis.\n", "  We use electron transport to characterize monolayer graphene - multilayer\nMoS2 heterostructures. Our samples show ambipolar characteristics and\nconductivity saturation on the electron branch which signals the onset of MoS2\nconduction band population. Surprisingly, the carrier density in graphene\ndecreases with gate bias once MoS2 is populated, demonstrating negative\ncompressibility in MoS2. We are able to interpret our measurements\nquantitatively by accounting for disorder and using the random phase\napproximation (RPA) for the exchange and correlation energies of both Dirac and\nparabolic-band two-dimensional electron gases. This interpretation allows us to\nextract the energetic offset between the conduction band edge of MoS2 and the\nDirac point of graphene.\n", "  We calculate the rotational broadening in the observed thermal spectra of\nneutron stars spinning at moderate rates in the Hartle-Thorne approximation.\nThese calculations accurately account for the effects of the second-order\nDoppler boosts as well as for the oblate shapes and the quadrupole moments of\nthe neutron stars. We find that fitting the spectra and inferring the\nbolometric fluxes under the assumption that a star is not rotating causes an\nunderestimate of the inferred fluxes and, thus, radii. The correction depends\non the stellar spin, radius, and observer's inclination. For a 10 km neutron\nstar spinning at 600 Hz, the rotational correction to the flux is ~1-4%, while\nfor a 15 km neutron star with the same spin period, the correction ranges from\n2% for pole-on sources to 12% for edge-on sources. We calculate the\ninclination-averaged corrections to inferred radii as a function of the\nneutron-star radius and mass and provide an empirical formula for the\ncorrections. For realistic neutron star parameters (1.4 M$_\\odot$, 12 km, 600\nHz), the stellar radius is on the order of 4% larger than the radius inferred\nunder the assumption that the star is not spinning.\n", "  We introduce concepts from optimal estimation to the stabilization of\nprecision frequency standards limited by noisy local oscillators. We develop a\ntheoretical framework casting various measures for frequency standard variance\nin terms of frequency-domain transfer functions, capturing the effects of\nfeedback stabilization via a time-series of Ramsey measurements. Using this\nframework we introduce a novel optimized hybrid predictive feedforward\nmeasurement protocol which employs results from multiple past measurements and\ntransfer-function-based calculations of measurement covariance to improve the\naccuracy of corrections within the feedback loop. In the presence of common\nnon-Markovian noise processes these measurements will be correlated in a\ncalculable manner, providing a means to capture the stochastic evolution of the\nLO frequency during the measurement cycle. We present analytic calculations and\nnumerical simulations of oscillator performance under competing feedback\nschemes and demonstrate benefits in both correction accuracy and long-term\noscillator stability using hybrid feedforward. Simulations verify that in the\npresence of uncompensated dead time and noise with significant spectral weight\nnear the inverse cycle time predictive feedforward outperforms traditional\nfeedback, providing a path towards developing a new class of stabilization\n\"software\" routines for frequency standards limited by noisy local oscillators.\n", "  Angle- and energy-loss- resolved distributions of helium atoms grazingly\nscattered from a Ag(110) surface along low indexed crystallographic directions\nare investigated considering impact energies in the few keV range. Final\nprojectile distributions are evaluated within a semi-classical formalism that\nincludes dissipative effects due to electron-hole excitations through a\nfriction force. For mono-energetic beams impinging along the $[1\\bar{1}0]$,\n$[1\\bar{1}2]$ and $[1\\bar{1}0]$ directions, the model predicts the presence of\nmultiple peak structures in energy-loss spectra. Such structures provide\ndetailed information about the trajectory-dependent energy loss. However, when\nthe experimental dispersion of the incident beam is taken into account, these\nenergy-loss peaks are completely washed out, giving rise to a smooth\nenergy-loss distribution, in fairly good agreement with available experimental\ndata.\n", "  In 1996, Huisken-Yau showed that every three-dimensional Riemannian manifold\ncan be uniquely foliated near infinity by stable closed CMC-surfaces if it is\nasymptotically equal to the (spatial) Schwarzschild solution and has positive\nmass. Their assumptions were later weakened by Metzger, Huang, Eichmair-Metzger\nand others. We further generalize these existence results in dimension three by\nproving that it is sufficient to assume asymptotic flatness and non-vanishing\nmass to conclude the existence and uniqueness of the CMC-foliation and explain\nwhy this seems to be the conceptually optimal result. Furthermore, we\ngeneralize the characterization of the corresponding coordinate CMC-center of\nmass by the ADM-center of mass proven previously by Corvino-Wu, Huang,\nEichmair-Metzger and others (under other assumptions).\n", "  Multivariate orthogonal polynomials in $D$ real dimensions are considered\nfrom the perspective of the Cholesky factorization of a moment matrix. The\napproach allows for the construction of corresponding multivariate orthogonal\npolynomials, associated second kind functions, Jacobi type matrices and\nassociated three term relations and also Christoffel-Darboux formul{\\ae}. The\nmultivariate orthogonal polynomials, its second kind functions and the\ncorresponding Christoffel-Darboux kernels are shown to be quasi-determinants\n--as well as Schur complements-- of bordered truncations of the moment matrix;\nquasi-tau functions are introduced. It is proven that the second kind functions\nare multivariate Cauchy transforms of the multivariate orthogonal polynomials.\nDiscrete and continuous deformations of the measure lead to Toda type\nintegrable hierarchy, being the corresponding flows described through Lax and\nZakharov-Shabat equations; bilinear equations are found. Varying size matrix\nnonlinear partial difference and differential equations of the 2D Toda lattice\ntype are shown to be solved by matrix coefficients of the multivariate\northogonal polynomials. The discrete flows lead to expressions for the\nmultivariate orthogonal polynomials and its second kind functions in terms of\nshifted quasi-tau matrices, which generalize to the multidimensional realm\nthose that relate the Baker and adjoint Baker functions with ratios of Miwa\nshifted $\\tau$-functions in the 1D scenario. In this context, the multivariate\nextension of the elementary Darboux transformation is given in terms of\nquasi-determinants of matrices built up by the evaluation, at a poised set of\nnodes lying in an appropriate hyperplane in $\\mathbb R^D$, of the multivariate\northogonal polynomials. The multivariate Christoffel formula for the iteration\nof $m$ elementary Darboux transformations is given as a quasi-determinant.\n", "  We show that $n$ thermal fermionic alkaline-earth atoms in a flat-bottom trap\nallow one to robustly implement a spin model displaying two symmetries: the\n$S_n$ symmetry that permutes atoms occupying different vibrational levels of\nthe trap and the SU($N$) symmetry associated with $N$ nuclear spin states. The\nhigh symmetry makes the model exactly solvable, which, in turn, enables the\nanalytic study of dynamical processes such as spin diffusion in this SU($N$)\nsystem. We also show how to use this system to generate entangled states that\nallow for Heisenberg-limited metrology. This highly symmetric spin model should\nbe experimentally realizable even when the vibrational levels are occupied\naccording to a high-temperature thermal or an arbitrary non-thermal\ndistribution.\n", "  Recently IceCube collaboration has reported first evidence for the\nastrophysical neutrinos. Observation corresponds to the total astrophysical\nneutrino flux of the order of $3 \\cdot 10^{-8}$ $GeV/cm^2/s/sr$ in a PeV energy\nrange. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are natural candidate sources for such\nneutrinos. To model the neutrino creation in AGNs we study photopion production\nprocesses on the radiation field of the Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disks in the\nblack hole vicinity. We show that this model can explain detected neutrino flux\nand avoids, at the same time, existing constraints from the gamma-ray and\ncosmic ray observations.\n", "  We present an analysis of the dynamics of two-flavour QCD in the vacuum.\nSpecial attention is payed to the transition from the high energy quark-gluon\nregime to the low energy regime governed by hadron dynamics. This is done\nwithin a functional renormalisation group approach to QCD amended by dynamical\nhadronisation techniques. The latter allow us to describe conveniently the\ntransition from the perturbative high-energy regime to the nonperturbative\nlow-energy limit without suffering from a fine-tuning of model parameters. In\nthe present work, we apply these techniques to two-flavour QCD with physical\nquark masses and show how the dynamics of the dominant low-energy degrees of\nfreedom emerge from the underlying quark-gluon dynamics.\n", "  We discuss a classically conformal radiative neutrino model with gauged B$-$L\nsymmetry, in which the B$-$L symmetry breaking can occur through the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism. As a result, Majorana mass term is generated and EW\nsymmetry breaking also occurs. We show some allowed parameters to satisfy\nseveral theoretical and experimental constraints. Theoretical constraints are\ninert conditions and Coleman-Weinberg condition. Experimental bounds are lepton\nflavor violation(especially \\mu -> e \\gamma), the current bound on the $Z'$\nmass at LHC, in additions to the neutrino oscillations.\n", "  The 2-flavor Polyakov-loop extended model is generalized by taking into\naccount the effective four-quark vector-type interaction with the coupling\nstrengths, which are endowed with a dependence on the Polyakov field $\\Phi$.\nThe effective vertex generates entanglement interaction between the Polyakov\nloop and the chiral condensate. We investigate the influence of an additional\nquark vector interaction and the entanglement interaction on the location of\nthe critical end-point at the given chemical potential or quark density. It is\nshown that the finite value of the vector interaction strength $G_{\\rm v}$\nimproves the model agreement with the lattice data. The influence of the\nnon-zero $G_{\\rm v}$ and entanglement on the thermodynamic observables and the\ncurvature of the crossover boundary in the $T-\\mu$ plane is also examined.\n", "  We investigate the crystallization mechanism of a single, flexible\nhomopolymer chain with short range attractions. For a sufficiently narrow\nattractive well, the system undergoes a first-order like freezing transition\nfrom an expanded disordered coil to a compact crystalline state. Based on a\nmaximum likelihood analysis of committor values computed for configurations\nobtained by Wang-Landau sampling, we construct a non-linear string reaction\ncoordinate for the coil-to-crystal transition. In contrast to a linear reaction\ncoordinate, the string reaction coordinate captures the effect of different\ndegrees of freedom controlling different stages of the transition. Our analysis\nindicates that a combination of the energy and the global crystallinity\nparameter Q6 provide the most accurate measure for the progress of the\ntransition. While the crystallinity parameter Q6 is most relevant in the\ninitial stages of the crystallization, the later stages are dominated by a\ndecrease in the potential energy.\n", "  Gauss's law in integral form states that closed surface integral of electric\nfield is proportional to net charge present within the volume bounded by this\nclosed surface. Gauss's law in differential form states that divergence of\nelectric field is proportional to charge's volume density. From Gauss's law it\nis concluded that in vacuum, where no electric charges are present, divergence\nof electric field and closed surface integral of electric field are zero. In\nthis paper we make an attempt to theoretically prove that for time-varying\nelectric fields Gauss's law is not valid. In other words, for time-varying\nelectric field even in vacuum divergence of electric field and closed surface\nintegral of electric field are non-zero. We do this by considering simple\nsinusoidal motion of the charge and then by calculating closed surface integral\nat specific time of time-varying electric field due to charge motion. Results\nshow that for charges at still and at motion with constant velocity Gauss's law\nis valid. However for charges moving with acceleration, Gauss's law is no\nlonger valid.\n", "  We investigate the crystallization of a single, flexible homopolymer chain\nusing transition path sampling (TPS). The chain consists of N identical\nspherical monomers evolved according to Langevin dynamics. While neighboring\nmonomers are coupled via harmonic springs, the non-neighboring monomers\ninteract via a hard core and a short-ranged attractive potential. For a\nsufficiently small interaction range {\\lambda}, the system undergoes a\nfirst-order freezing transition from an expanded, disordered phase to a compact\ncrystalline state. Using a new shooting move tailored to polymers combined with\na committor analysis, we study the transition state ensemble of an N=128 chain\nand search for possible reaction coordinates based on likelihood maximization.\nWe find that typical transition states consist of a crystalline nucleus with\none or more chain fragments attached to it. Furthermore, we show that the\nnumber of particles in the crystalline core is not well suited as a reaction\ncoordinate. We then present an improved reaction coordinate, which includes\ninformation from the potential energy and the overall crystallinity of the\npolymer.\n", "  We use the NIHAO (Numerical Investigation of Hundred Astrophysical Objects)\ncosmological simulations to study the effects of galaxy formation on key\nproperties of dark matter (DM) haloes. NIHAO consists of $\\simeq 90$\nhigh-resolution SPH simulations that include (metal-line) cooling, star\nformation, and feedback from massive stars and SuperNovae, and cover a wide\nstellar and halo mass range: $10^6 < M_* / M_{\\odot} < 10^{11}$ ( $10^{9.5} <\nM_{\\rm halo} / M_{\\odot} < 10^{12.5}$). When compared to DM-only simulations,\nthe NIHAO haloes have similar shapes at the virial radius, R_{\\rm vir}, but are\nsubstantially rounder inside $\\simeq 0.1R_{\\rm vir}$. In NIHAO simulations\n$c/a$ increases with halo mass and integrated star formation efficiency,\nreaching $\\sim 0.8$ at the Milky Way mass (compared to 0.5 in DM-only),\nproviding a plausible solution to the long-standing conflict between\nobservations and DM-only simulations. The radial profile of the phase-space $Q$\nparameter ($\\rho/\\sigma^3$) is best fit with a single power law in DM-only\nsimulations, but shows a flattening within $\\simeq 0.1R_{\\rm vir}$ for NIHAO\nfor total masses $M>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. Finally, the global velocity\ndistribution of DM is similar in both DM-only and NIHAO simulations, but in the\nsolar neighborhood, NIHAO galaxies deviate substantially from Maxwellian. The\ndistribution is more symmetric, roughly Gaussian, with a peak that shifts to\nhigher velocities for Milky Way mass haloes. We provide the distribution\nparameters which can be used for predictions for direct DM detection\nexperiments. Our results underline the ability of the galaxy formation\nprocesses to modify the properties of dark matter haloes.\n", "  It is well-known that the Riemann curvature tensor has no discontinuity at\nthe black hole horizon. It is also well-known that a freely falling observer\ntakes finite time to reach the horizon from an outside point. However, the\nusual assumption is that such an observer resides in a frame of reference\n(spaceship) of infinitesimal size. This assumption is justified as long as the\ncoordinates are continuous enough to assume that the observer's frame is small\ncompared to the variations of the metric from a local flat metric. Such an\nassumption may be invalid when the coordinate system has not only a\ndiscontinuity but a singularity like the one at the horizon. Hence, here, the\ncharacteristics of a finite frame (a spaceship) near a black hole horizon is\ndiscussed. It is shown that clocks placed at the front and rear ends have\ndifferent time scales even in the limit when they reach the horizon at the same\ntime. This renders such a frame physically meaningless. It is also argued that\nthe forces that are expected to keep a realistic frame (like a spaceship) in\none piece tend to zero near the horizon. So, a physical spaceship is expected\nto fall apart near the horizon.\n", "  We consider one particle confined to a deformed one-dimensional wire. The\nquantum mechanical equivalent of the classical problem is not uniquely defined.\nWe describe several possible hamiltonians and corresponding solutions for a\nfinite wire with fixed endpoints and non-vanishing curvature. We compute and\ncompare the disparate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from different\nquantization prescriptions. The JWKB approximation without potential leads\nprecisely to the square well spectrum and the coordinate dependent stretched or\ncompressed box related eigenfunctions. The geometric potential arising from an\nadiabatic expansion in terms of curvature is at best only valid for very small\ncurvature.\n", "  We present a review of the state-of-the-art of our understanding of the\nintrinsic charm and bottom content of the nucleon. We discuss theoretical\ncalculations, constraints from global analyses, and collider observables\nsensitive to the intrinsic heavy quark distributions. A particular emphasis is\nput on the potential of a high-energy and high-luminosity fixed target\nexperiment using the LHC beams (AFTER@LHC) to search for intrinsic charm.\n", "  We calculate the effects of spot size on pulse profiles of moderately\nrotating neutron stars. Specifically, we quantify the bias introduced in radius\nmeasurements from the common assumption that spots are infinitesimally small.\nWe find that this assumption is reasonable for spots smaller than\n10$^\\circ$-18$^\\circ$ and leads to errors that are $\\le$10% in the radius\nmeasurement, depending on the location of the spot and the inclination of the\nobserver. We consider the implications of our results for neutron star radius\nmeasurements with the upcoming and planned X-ray missions NICER and LOFT. We\ncalculate the expected spot size for different classes of sources and\ninvestigate the circumstances under which the assumption of a small spot is\njustified.\n", "  This is the first of a series of two technical papers devoted to the analysis\nof holonomy invariants in strict higher gauge theory with end applications in\nhigher Chern--Simons theory. For a flat 2--connection, we define the 2-holonomy\nof surface knots of arbitrary genus and determine its covariance properties\nunder 1--gauge transformation and change of base data.\n", "  This is the second of a series of two technical papers devoted to the\nanalysis of holonomy invariants in strict higher gauge theory with end\napplications in higher Chern--Simons theory. We provide a definition of trace\nover a crossed module such to yield surface knot invariants upon application to\n2-holonomies. We show further that the properties of the trace are best\ndescribed using the theory quandle crossed modules.\n", "  We employ an all-sky map of the anomalous microwave emission (AME) produced\nby component separation of the microwave sky to study correlations between the\nAME and Galactic dust properties. We find that while the AME is highly\ncorrelated with all tracers of dust emission, the best predictor of the AME\nstrength is the dust radiance. Fluctuations in the AME intensity per dust\nradiance are uncorrelated with fluctuations in the emission from polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), casting doubt on the association between AME and\nPAHs. The PAH abundance is strongly correlated with the dust optical depth and\ndust radiance, consistent with PAH destruction in low density regions. We find\nthat the AME intensity increases with increasing radiation field strength, at\nvariance with predictions from the spinning dust hypothesis. Finally, the\ntemperature-dependence of the AME per dust radiance disfavors the\ninterpretation of the AME as thermal emission. A reconsideration of other AME\ncarriers, such as ultrasmall silicates, and other emission mechanisms, such as\nmagnetic dipole emission, is warranted.\n", "  This is an introduction to models of accretion discs around black holes.\nAfter a presentation of the non-relativistic equations describing the structure\nand evolution of geometrically thin accretion discs we discuss their\nsteady-state solutions and compare them to observation. Next we describe in\ndetail the thermal-viscous disc instability model and its application to dwarf\nnovae for which it was designed and its X-ray irradiated-disc version which\nexplains the soft X--ray transients, i.e. outbursting black-hole low-mass X-ray\nbinaries. We then turn to the role of advection in accretion flows onto black\nholes illustrating its action and importance with a toy model describing both\nADAFs and slim discs. We conclude with a presentation of the\ngeneral-relativistic formalism describing accretion discs in the Kerr\nspace-time.\n", "  Dark energy is investigated from the perspective of quantum cosmology. It is\nfound that, together with an appropriate normal ordering factor $q$, only when\nthere is dark energy then can the cosmological wave function be normalized.\nThis interesting observation may require further attention.\n", "  By synchronizing a microwave waveform with the synchrotron x-ray pulses, we\nuse the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) of the Py (Ni81Fe19) layer in a\nPy/Cu/Cu75Mn25/Cu/Co multilayer to pump a pure spin current into the Cu75Mn25\nspacer layer, and then directly probe the spin current in the Cu75Mn25 layer by\na time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). This element-specific\npump-probe measurement unambiguously identifies the AC spin current in the\nCu75Mn25 layer. In addition, phase resolved x-ray measurements reveal a\ncharacteristic bipolar phase behavior of the Co spins that is a fingerprint of\nspin-current driven spin precession.\n", "  We find significant fluctuations of angular momentum within the convective\nhelium shell of a pre-collapse massive star - a core-collapse supernova\nprogenitor - which may facilitate the formation of accretion disks and jets\nthat can explode the star. The convective flow in our model of an evolved\nM_ZAMS=15Msun star, computed with the sub-sonic hydrodynamic solver MAESTRO,\ncontains entire shells with net angular momentum in different directions. This\nphenomenon may have important implications for the late evolutionary stages of\nmassive stars, and for the dynamics of core-collapse.\n", "  Knots or blobs observed in astrophysical jets are commonly interpreted as\nshock waves moving along them. Long time observations of the HST-1 knot inside\nthe jet of the galaxy M87 have produced detailed multi-wavelength light curves.\nIn this article, we model these light curves using the semi-analytical approach\ndeveloped by Mendoza et al. (2009). This model was developed to account for the\nlight curves of working surfaces moving along relativistic jets. These working\nsurfaces are generated by periodic oscillations of the injected flow velocity\nand mass ejection rates at the base of the jet. Using genetic algorithms to fit\nthe parameters of the model, we are able to explain the outbursts observed in\nthe light curves of the HST-1 knot with an accuracy greater than a 2 sigma\nstatistical confidence level.\n", "  We present the discovery by the WASP-South survey, in close collaboration\nwith the Euler and TRAPPIST telescopes, of WASP-121 b, a new remarkable\nshort-period transiting hot Jupiter, whose planetary nature has been\nstatistically validated by the PASTIS software. The planet has a mass of\n$1.183_{-0.062}^{+0.064}$ $M_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, a radius of 1.865 $\\pm$ 0.044\n$R_{\\mathrm{Jup}}$, and transits every $1.2749255_{-0.0000025}^{+0.0000020}$\ndays an active F6-type main-sequence star ($V$=10.4, $1.353_{-0.079}^{+0.080}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, 1.458 $\\pm$ 0.030 $R_{\\odot}$, $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ = 6460 $\\pm$ 140\nK). A notable property of WASP-121 b is that its orbital semi-major axis is\nonly $\\sim$1.15 times larger than its Roche limit, which suggests that the\nplanet might be close to tidal disruption. Furthermore, its large size and\nextreme irradiation ($\\sim$$7.1\\:10^{9}$ erg $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$) make it an excellent target for atmospheric studies via\nsecondary eclipse observations. Using the TRAPPIST telescope, we indeed detect\nits emission in the $z'$-band at better than $\\sim$4$\\sigma$, the measured\noccultation depth being 603 $\\pm$ 130 ppm. Finally, from a measurement of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect with the CORALIE spectrograph, we infer a\nsky-projected spin-orbit angle of $257.8_{-5.5}^{+5.3}$ deg. This result\nindicates a significant misalignment between the spin axis of the host star and\nthe orbital plane of the planet, the planet being in a nearly polar orbit. Such\na high misalignment suggests a migration of the planet involving strong\ndynamical events with a third body.\n", "  It is shown in this paper that the symplectic form for the system consisting\nof $D$-dimensional bulk Palatini gravity and SO$(1,1)$ BF theory on an isolated\nhorizon as a boundary just contains the bulk term. An alternative quantization\nprocedure for the boundary BF theory is presented. The area entropy is\ndetermined by the degree of freedom of the bulk spin network states which\nsatisfy a suitable boundary condition. The gauge-fixing condition in the\napproach and the advantages of the approach are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate dynamical many-body localization and delocalization in an\nintegrable system of periodically-kicked, interacting linear rotors. The\nHamiltonian we investigate is linear in momentum, and its Floquet evolution\noperator is analytically tractable for arbitrary interaction strengths. One of\nthe hallmarks of this model is that depending on certain parameters, it\nmanifest both localization and delocalization in momentum space. We explicitly\nshow that for this model, the energy being bounded at long times is not a\nsufficient condition for dynamical localization. Besides integrals of motion\nassociated to the integrability, this model manifests additional integrals of\nmotion, which are the exclusive consequence of dynamical many-body\nlocalization. We also propose an experimental scheme, involving voltage-biased\nJosephson junctions, to realize such many-body kicked models.\n", "  We study the damping from neutral-ion collisions of both incompressible and\ncompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in partially ionized medium.\nWe start from the linear analysis of MHD waves applying both single-fluid and\ntwo-fluid treatments. The damping rates derived from the linear analysis are\nthen used in determining the damping scales of MHD turbulence. The physical\nconnection between the damping scale of MHD turbulence and cutoff boundary of\nlinear MHD waves is investigated. Our analytical results are shown to be\napplicable in a variety of partially ionized interstellar medium (ISM) phases\nand solar chromosphere. As a significant astrophysical utility, we introduce\ndamping effects to propagation of cosmic rays in partially ionized ISM. The\nimportant role of turbulence damping in both transit-time damping and\ngyroresonance is identified.\n", "  We report on re-calculation of the next-to-leading order DGLAP evolution\nkernels performed in a scheme suited for Monte Carlo simulations of parton\ncascades (parton showers).\n", "  We systematically generalize the exotic $^3$He-B phase, which not only\nexhibits unconventional symmetry but is also isotropic and topologically\nnon-trivial, to arbitrary partial-wave channels with multi-component fermions.\nThe concrete example with four-component fermions is illustrated including the\nisotropic $f$, $p$ and $d$-wave pairings in the spin septet, triplet, and\nquintet channels, respectively. The odd partial-wave channel pairings are\ntopologically non-trivial, while pairings in even partial-wave channels are\ntopologically trivial. The topological index reaches the largest value of $N^2$\nin the $p$-wave channel ($N$ is half of the fermion component number). The\nsurface spectra exhibit multiple linear and even high order Dirac cones.\nApplications to multi-orbital condensed matter systems and multi-component\nultra-cold large spin fermion systems are discussed.\n", "  A measurement of the W boson pair production cross section in proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is presented. The data collected with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 inverse\nfemtobarns. The W+W- candidates are selected from events with two charged\nleptons, electrons or muons, and large missing transverse energy. The measured\nW+W- cross section is 60.1 +/- 0.9 (stat) +/- 3.2 (exp) +/- 3.1 (theo) +/- 1.6\n(lum) pb = 60.1 +/- 4.8 pb, consistent with the standard model prediction. The\nW+W- cross sections are also measured in two different fiducial phase space\nregions. The normalized differential cross section is measured as a function of\nkinematic variables of the final-state charged leptons and compared with\nseveral perturbative QCD predictions. Limits on anomalous gauge couplings\nassociated with dimension-six operators are also given in the framework of an\neffective field theory. The corresponding 95% confidence level intervals are\n-5.7 < c[WWW]/Lambda^2 < 5.9 TeV^{-2}, -11.4 < c[W]/Lambda^2 < 5.4 TeV^{-2},\n-29.2 < c[B]/Lambda^2 < 23.9 TeV^{-2}, in the HISZ basis.\n", "  We consider a model of the classical spinning particle in which the coadjoint\norbits of the Poincare group are parametrized by two pairs of canonically\nconjugate four vectors, one representing the standard position and momentum\nvariables and the other which encodes the spinning degrees of freedom. This\n\"Dual Phase Space Model\" is shown to be a consistent theory of both massive and\nmassless particles and allows for coupling to background fields such as\nelectromagnetism. The on-shell action is derived and shown to be a sum of two\nterms, one associated with motion in spacetime and the other with motion in\n\"spin space.\" Interactions between spinning particles are studied and a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for consistency of a three-point vertex is\nestablished.\n", "  An inelastic light (Raman) scattering study of nematicity and critical\nfluctuations in ${\\rm Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)_2As_2}$ ($0\\le x \\le 0.051$) is\npresented. It is shown that the response from fluctuations appears only in\n$B_{1g}$ (${x^2-y^2}$) symmetry. The scattering amplitude increases towards the\nstructural transition at $T_s$ but vanishes only below the magnetic ordering\ntransition at $T_{\\rm SDW} < T_s$, suggesting a magnetic origin of the\nfluctuations. The theoretical analysis explains the selection rules and the\ntemperature dependence of the fluctuation response. These results make\nmagnetism the favorite candidate for driving the series of transitions.%Below\n$T_{\\rm SDW}$ the gap of the magnetically ordered phase opens up.\n", "  The dynamics of helium shell convection driven by nuclear burning establish\nthe conditions for runaway in the sub-Chandrasekhar mass, double detonation\nmodel for Type Ia supernovae, as well as for a variety of other explosive\nphenomena. We explore these convection dynamics for a range of white dwarf core\nand helium shell masses in three dimensions using the low Mach number\nhydrodynamics code Maestro. We present calculations of the bulk properties of\nthis evolution, including time-series evolution of global diagnostics, lateral\naverages of the 3D state, and the global 3D state. We find a variety of\noutcomes including quasi-equilibrium, localized runaway, and nova-like runaway.\nOur results suggest the double detonation progenitor model is promising, that\n3D, dynamic convection plays a key role, and that these systems warrant further\nstudy.\n", "  We study a quantum mechanical system consisting of up to three identical\ndipoles confined to move along a helical shaped trap. The long-range\ninteractions between particles confined to move in this one dimension leads to\nan interesting effective two-particle potential with an oscillating behaviour.\nFor this system we calculate the spectrum and the wave functions of the bound\nstates. The full quantum solutions show clear imprints of the tendency for the\nsystem to form chains of dipoles along the helix, i.e. a configuration in which\nthe dipoles are sitting approximately one winding of the helix apart so that\nthey can take maximal advantage of the strong head-to-tail attraction that is a\ngeneric feature of the dipole-dipole interaction.\n", "  Using an $N$-body evolution code that does not rely on softened potentials, I\nhave created a suite of unbound interacting cluster pair simulations. The\nmotions of the centers of mass of the clusters have been tracked and compared\nto the trajectories of point masses interacting via one of four different\nsoftened potential prescriptions. I find that the relationship between the\nimpact parameter of the cluster interaction and the point-mass softening length\nthat best approximates each cluster's center-of-mass motion depends on the\nadopted prescription. In general, the range of allowed softening lengths grows\nroughly linearly with the impact parameter, but zero softening is acceptable in\nthe majority of situations. In an $N$-body simulation that adopts a fixed\nsoftening length, such relationships lead to the possibility of two-body\neffects, like dynamical friction, being either larger or smaller than the\ncorresponding cluster situation. Further consideration of more specific\n$N$-body situations leads estimating that a very small fraction of point-mass\nencounters experience two-body effects significantly different than those of\nequivalent clusters.\n", "  We study the three-body $\\Lambda_b$ decays of $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi pM$ with\n$M=K^-$ and $\\pi^-$. The two new states ${\\cal P}_{c1}\\equiv {\\cal\nP}_c(4380)^+$ and ${\\cal P}_{c2}\\equiv {\\cal P}_c(4450)^+$ observed recently as\nthe resonances in the $J/\\psi p$ invariant mass spectrum of $\\Lambda_b\\to\nJ/\\psi p K^-$ can be identified to consist of five quarks, $uudc\\bar c$, being\nconsistent with the existence of the pentaquark states. We argue that, in the\ndoubly charmful $\\Lambda_b$ decays of $\\Lambda_b\\to J/\\psi pK^-$ through $b\\to\nc\\bar c s$, apart from those through the non-resonant $\\Lambda_b\\to pK^-$ and\nresonant $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda^*\\to pK^-$ transitions, the third contribution\nwith the non-factorizable effects is not the dominant part for the resonant\n$\\Lambda_b\\to K^-{\\cal P}_{c1,c2}, {\\cal P}_{c1,c2}\\to J/\\psi p$ processes,\nsuch that we propose that the ${\\cal P}_{c1,c2}$ productions are mainly from\nthe charmless $\\Lambda_b$ decays through $b\\to \\bar u u s$, in which the $c\\bar\nc$ content in ${\\cal P}_{c1,c2}$ arises from the intrinsic charms within the\n$\\Lambda_b$ baryon. We hence predict the observables related to the branching\nratios and the direct CP violating asymmetries to be ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\pi^-({\\cal P}_{c1,c2}\\to) J/\\psi p)/{\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to K^-({\\cal\nP}_{c1,c2}\\to) J/\\psi p)=0.8\\pm 0.1$, ${\\cal A}_{CP}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\pi^-({\\cal\nP}_{c1,c2}\\to)J/\\psi p)=(-3.9\\pm 0.2)\\%$, and ${\\cal A}_{CP}(\\Lambda_b\\to\nK^-({\\cal P}_{c1,c2}\\to)J/\\psi p)=(5.8\\pm 0.2)\\%$, which can alleviate the\ninconsistency between the theoretical expectations from the three contributions\nin the doubly charmful $\\Lambda_b$ decays and the observed data.\n", "  Determining the equilibrium configuration of an elastic M\\\"{o}bius band is a\nchallenging problem. In recent years numerical results have been obtained by\nother investigators, employing first the Kirchhoff theory of rods and later the\ndevelopable, ruled-surface model of Wunderlich. In particular, the strategy\nemployed previously for the latter does not deliver an unconstrained\nequilibrium configuration for the complete strip. Here we present our own\nsystematic approach to the same problem for each of these models, with the\nultimate goal of assessing the stability of flip-symmetric configurations. The\npresence of pointwise constraints considerably complicates the latter step. We\nobtain the first stability results for the problem, numerically demonstrating\nthat such equilibria render the total potential energy a local minimum. Along\nthe way we introduce a novel regularization for the for the singular Wunderlich\nmodel that delivers unconstrained equilibria for the complete strip, which can\nthen be tested for stability.\n", "  We propose to create superposition states of over 100 Strontium atoms being\nin a ground state or metastable optical clock state, using the Kerr-type\ninteraction due to Rydberg state dressing in an optical lattice. The two\ncomponents of the superposition can differ by of order 300 eV in energy,\nallowing tests of energy decoherence models with greatly improved sensitivity.\nWe take into account the effects of higher-order nonlinearities, spatial\ninhomogeneity of the interaction, decay from the Rydberg state, collective\nmany-body decoherence, atomic motion, molecular formation and diminishing\nRydberg level separation for increasing principal number.\n", "  We present the first official release of the nCTEQ nuclear parton\ndistribution functions with errors. The main addition to the previous nCTEQ\nPDFs is the introduction of PDF uncertainties based on the Hessian method.\nAnother important addition is the inclusion of pion production data from RHIC\nthat give us a handle on constraining the gluon PDF. This contribution\nsummarizes our results from arXiv:1509.00792 and concentrates on the comparison\nwith other groups providing nuclear parton distributions.\n", "  Tracking the sign of fluctuations governed by the $(1+1)$-dimensional\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, we show, both experimentally and\nnumerically, that its evolution has an unexpected link to a simple stochastic\nmodel called the renewal process, studied in the context of aging and\nergodicity breaking. Although KPZ and the renewal process are fundamentally\ndifferent in many aspects, we find remarkable agreement in some of the time\ncorrelation properties, such as the recurrence time distributions and the\npersistence probability, while the two systems can be different in other\nproperties. Moreover, we find inequivalence between long-time and ensemble\naverages in the fraction of time occupied by a specific sign of the KPZ-class\nfluctuations. The distribution of its long-time average converges to nontrivial\nbroad functions, which are found to differ significantly from that of the\nrenewal process, but instead be characteristic of KPZ. Thus, we obtain a new\ntype of ergodicity breaking for such systems with many-body interactions. Our\nanalysis also detects qualitative differences in time-correlation properties of\ncircular and flat KPZ-class interfaces, which were suggested from previous\nexperiments and simulations but still remain theoretically unexplained.\n", "  The uncertain origin of the recently-discovered `changing-looking' quasar\nphenomenon -- in which a luminous quasar dims significantly to a quiescent\nstate in repeat spectroscopy over ~10 year timescales -- may present unexpected\nchallenges to our understanding of quasar accretion. To better understand this\nphenomenon, we take a first step to building a sample of changing-look quasars\nwith a systematic but simple archival search for these objects in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 12. By leveraging the >10 year baselines for\nobjects with repeat spectroscopy, we uncover two new changing-look quasars, and\na third discovered previously. Decomposition of the multi-epoch spectra and\nanalysis of the broad emission lines suggest that the quasar accretion disk\nemission dims due to rapidly decreasing accretion rates (by factors of >2.5),\nwhile disfavoring changes in intrinsic dust extinction for the two objects\nwhere these analyses are possible. Broad emission line energetics also support\nintrinsic dimming of quasar emission as the origin for this phenomenon rather\nthan transient tidal disruption events or supernovae. Although our search\ncriteria included quasars at all redshifts and transitions from either\nquasar-like to galaxy-like states or the reverse, all of the clear cases of\nchanging-look quasars discovered were at relatively low-redshift (z ~ 0.2 -\n0.3) and only exhibit quasar-like to galaxy-like transitions.\n", "  Momentum-space azimuthal harmonic event planes (EP) are constructed from\nfinal-state midrapidity particles binned in transverse momentum (pT ) in\nsqrt(s_NN) = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions in a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model.\nThe EP correlations between pT bins, corrected by EP resolutions, are smaller\nthan unity. This indicates that the EP's decorrelate over pT in AMPT,\nqualitatively consistent with data and hydrodynamic calculations. It is further\nfound that the EP correlations approximately factorize into single pT-bin EP\ncorrelations to a common plane. This common plane appears to be the\nmomentum-space EP integrated over all pT, not the configuration space\nparticipant plane (PP).\n", "  Rapid developments in the emerging field of stretchable and conformable\nphotonics necessitate analytical expressions for boundary conditions at\nmetasurfaces of arbitrary geometries. Here, we introduce the concept of\nconformal boundary optics: a design theory that determines the optical response\nfor designer input and output fields at such interfaces. Given any object, we\ncan realise coatings to achieve exotic effects like optical illusions and\nanomalous diffraction behaviour. This approach is relevant to a broad range of\napplications from conventional refractive optics to the design of the\nnext-generation of wearable optical components. This concept can be generalized\nto other fields of research where designer interfaces with nontrivial\ngeometries are encountered.\n", "  Collective behavior where a set of elements interact and generate effects\nthat are beyond the reach of the individual non interacting elements, are\nalways of great interest in physics. Quantum collective effects that have no\nclassical analogue are even more intriguing. In this work we show how to\nconstruct collective quantum heat machines and explore their performance boosts\nwith respect to regular machines. Without interactions between the machines the\nindividual units operate in a stochastic, non-quantum manner. The construction\nof the collective machine becomes possible by introducing two simple quantum\noperations: coherence extraction and coherence injection. Together these\noperations can harvest coherence from one engine and use it to boost the\nperformance of a slightly different engine. For weakly driven engines we show\nthat the collective work output scales quadratically with the number of engines\nrather than linearly. Eventually, the boost saturates and the scaling becomes\nlinear. Nevertheless, even in saturation, work is still significantly boosted\ncompared to individual operation. To study the reversibility of the collective\nmachine we introduce the 'entropy pollution' measure. It is shown that there is\na regime where the collective machine is N times more reversible while\nproducing N times more work, compared to the individual operation of N units.\nMoreover, the collective machine can even be more reversible than the most\nreversible unit in the collective. This high level of reversibility becomes\npossible due to a special symbiotic mechanism between engine pairs.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a fundamental common trait of quantum phenomena, from\nthe interference of matter waves to quantum degeneracy of identical particles.\nDespite its importance, estimating and measuring quantum coherence in generic,\nmixed many-body quantum states remains a formidable challenge, with fundamental\nimplications in areas as broad as quantum condensed matter, quantum\ninformation, quantum metrology and quantum biology. Here we provide a\nquantitative definition of the variance of quantum coherent fluctuations (the\nquantum variance) of any observable on generic quantum states. The quantum\nvariance generalizes the concept of thermal de Broglie wavelength (for the\nposition of a free quantum particle) to the space of eigenvalues of any\nobservable, quantifying the degree of coherent delocalization in that space.\nThe quantum variance is generically measurable and computable as the difference\nbetween the static fluctuations and the static susceptibility of the\nobservable; despite its simplicity, it is found to provide a tight lower bound\nto most widely accepted estimators of \"quantumness\" of observables (both as a\nfeature as well as a resource), such as the Wigner-Yanase skew information and\nthe quantum Fisher information. When considering bipartite fluctuations in an\nextended quantum system, the quantum variance expresses genuine quantum\ncorrelations (of discord type) among the two parts. In the case of many-body\nsystems it is found to obey an area law at finite temperature, extending\ntherefore area laws of entanglement and quantum fluctuations of pure states to\nthe mixed-state context. Hence the quantum variance paves the way to the\nmeasurement of macroscopic quantum coherence and quantum correlations in most\ncomplex quantum systems.\n", "  A universal characteristic of mesoscale turbulence in active suspensions is\nthe emergence of a typical vortex length scale, distinctly different from the\nscale-invariance of turbulent high-Reynolds number flows. Collective\nlength-scale selection has been observed in bacterial fluids, endothelial\ntissue and active colloides, yet the physical origins of this phenomenon remain\nelusive. Here, we systematically derive an effective fourth-order field theory\nfrom a generic microscopic model that allows us to predict the typical vortex\nsize in microswimmer suspensions. Building on a self-consistent closure\ncondition, the derivation shows that the vortex length scale is determined by\nthe competition between local alignment forces and intermediate-range\nhydrodynamic interactions. Vortex structures found in simulations of the theory\nagree with recent measurements in Bacillus subtilis suspensions. Moreover, our\napproach correctly predicts an effective viscosity enhancement (reduction), as\nreported experimentally for puller (pusher) microorganisms.\n", "  Mass calibration uncertainty is the largest systematic effect for using\nclusters of galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters. We present weak\nlensing mass measurements from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Stripe 82\nSurvey for galaxy clusters selected through their high signal-to-noise thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signal measured with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope\n(ACT). For a sample of 9 ACT clusters with a tSZ signal-to-noise greater than\nfive the average weak lensing mass is\n$\\left(4.8\\pm0.8\\right)\\,\\times10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, consistent with the\ntSZ mass estimate of $\\left(4.70\\pm1.0\\right)\\,\\times10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$\nwhich assumes a universal pressure profile for the cluster gas. Our results are\nconsistent with previous weak-lensing measurements of tSZ-detected clusters\nfrom the Planck satellite. When comparing our results, we estimate the\nEddington bias correction for the sample intersection of Planck and\nweak-lensing clusters which was previously excluded.\n", "  We numerically determine the entropy for heat-conducting states, which is\nconnected to the so-called excess heat considered as a basic quantity for\nsteady-state thermodynamics in nonequilibrium. We adopt an efficient method to\nestimate the entropy from the bare heat current and find that the obtained\nentropy agrees with the familiar local equilibrium hypothesis well. Our method\npossesses a wider applicability than local equilibrium and opens a possibility\nto compare thermodynamic properties of complex systems with those in the local\nequilibrium. We further investigate the entropy for heat-conducting states and\nfind that it exhibits both extensive and additive properties; however, the two\nproperties do not degenerate each other differently from those at equilibrium.\nThe separation of the extensivity and additivity makes it difficult to apply\npowerful thermodynamic methods.\n", "  We optimise the parameters of the Population Monte Carlo algorithm using\nnumerical simulations. The optimisation is based on an efficiency statistic\nrelated to the number of samples evaluated prior to convergence, and is applied\nto a D-dimensional Gaussian distribution to derive optimal scaling laws for the\nalgorithm parameters. More complex distributions such as the banana and bimodal\ndistributions are also studied. We apply these results to a cosmological\nparameter estimation problem that uses CMB anisotropy data from the WMAP\nnine-year release to constrain a six parameter adiabatic model and a fifteen\nparameter admixture model, consisting of correlated adiabatic and isocurvature\nperturbations. In the case of the adiabatic model and the admixture model we\nfind respective degradation factors of three and twenty, relative to the\noptimal Gaussian case, due to degeneracies in the underlying parameter space.\nThe WMAP nine-year data constrain the admixture model to have an isocurvature\nfraction of at most $36.3 \\pm 2.8$ percent.\n", "  We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit\nHST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four\nof the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3\n$H_{140}$ imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel $I_{814}$\nimaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric\ncatalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we\ndescribe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with\ndata from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that\nno slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many\nspectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract\ninterlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014)\nphotometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit\nsimultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the\nmorphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has\n98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to $JH_{IR}\\leq 26$ and\n22,548 with $JH_{IR}\\leq 24$, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.\nOf this sample 5,459 galaxies are at $z>1.5$ and 9,621 are at $0.7<z<1.5$,\nwhere H$\\alpha$ falls in the G141 wavelength coverage. Based on comparisons\nwith ground-based spectroscopic redshifts, and on analyses of paired galaxies\nand repeat observations, the typical redshift error for $JH_{IR}\\leq 24$\ngalaxies in our catalog is $\\sigma_z \\approx 0.003 \\times (1+z)$, i.e., one\nnative WFC3 pixel. The $3\\sigma$ limit for emission line fluxes of point\nsources is $1.5\\times10^{-17}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. We show various\nrepresentations of the full dataset, as well as individual examples that\nhighlight the range of spectra that we find in the survey.\n", "  We analyze the angular momenta of massive star forming galaxies (SFGs) at the\npeak of the cosmic star formation epoch (z~0.8-2.6). Our sample of ~360\nlog(M*/Msun) ~ 9.3-11.8 SFGs is mainly based on the KMOS3D and SINS/zC-SINF\nsurveys of H$\\alpha$ kinematics, and collectively provides a representative\nsubset of the massive star forming population. The inferred halo scale angular\nmomentum distribution is broadly consistent with that theoretically predicted\nfor their dark matter halos, in terms of mean spin parameter <$\\lambda$> ~\n0.037 and its dispersion ($\\sigma_{log(\\lambda)}$~0.2). Spin parameters\ncorrelate with the disk radial scale, and with their stellar surface density,\nbut do not depend significantly on halo mass, stellar mass, or redshift. Our\ndata thus support the long-standing assumption that on average, even at high\nredshifts, the specific angular momentum of disk galaxies reflects that of\ntheir dark matter halos (j_d = j_DM). The lack of correlation between $\\lambda$\nx (j_d/j_DM) and the nuclear stellar density $\\Sigma_{*}$(1kpc) favors a\nscenario where disk-internal angular momentum redistribution leads to\n\"compaction\" inside massive high-redshift disks. For our sample, the inferred\naverage stellar-to-dark matter mass ratio is ~2%, consistent with abundance\nmatching results. Including the molecular gas, the total baryonic disk-to-dark\nmatter mass ratio is ~5% for halos near $10^{12}$ Msun, which corresponds to\n31% of the cosmologically available baryons, implying that high-redshift disks\nare strongly baryon dominated.\n", "  Precision measurements of solar neutrinos emitted by specific nuclear\nreaction chains in the Sun are of great interest for developing an improved\nunderstanding of star formation and evolution. Given the expected neutrino\nfluxes and known detection reactions, such measurements require detectors\ncapable of collecting neutrino-electron scattering data in exposures on the\norder of 1 ktonne yr, with good energy resolution and extremely low background.\nTwo-phase liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs) are under\ndevelopment for direct Dark Matter WIMP searches, which possess very large\nsensitive mass, high scintillation light yield, good energy resolution, and\ngood spatial resolution in all three cartesian directions. While enabling Dark\nMatter searches with sensitivity extending to the \"neutrino floor\" (given by\nthe rate of nuclear recoil events from solar neutrino coherent scattering),\nsuch detectors could also enable precision measurements of solar neutrino\nfluxes using the neutrino-electron elastic scattering events. Modeling results\nare presented for the cosmogenic and radiogenic backgrounds affecting solar\nneutrino detection in a 300 tonne (100 tonne fiducial) LAr TPC operating at\nLNGS depth (3,800 meters of water equivalent). The results show that such a\ndetector could measure the CNO neutrino rate with ~15% precision, and\nsignificantly improve the precision of the 7Be and pep neutrino rates compared\nto the currently available results from the Borexino organic liquid\nscintillator detector.\n", "  Double-degenerate (DD) mergers of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs have recently\nemerged as a leading candidate for normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). However,\nmany outstanding questions surround DD mergers, including the characteristics\nof their light curves and spectra. We have recently identified a spiral\ninstability in the post-merger phase of DD mergers and demonstrated that this\ninstability self-consistently leads to detonation in some cases. We call this\nthe spiral merger SN Ia model. Here, we utilize the SuperNu radiative transfer\nsoftware to calculate three-dimensional synthetic light curves and spectra of\nthe spiral merger simulation with a system mass of 2.1 $M_\\odot$ from Kashyap\net al. Because of their large system masses, both violent and spiral merger\nlight curves are slowly declining. The spiral merger resembles very slowly\ndeclining SNe Ia, including SN 2001ay, and provides a more natural explanation\nfor its observed properties than other SN Ia explosion models. Previous\nsynthetic light curves and spectra of violent DD mergers demonstrate a strong\ndependence on viewing angle, which is in conflict with observations. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the light curves and spectra of the spiral merger are less\nsensitive to the viewing angle than violent mergers, in closer agreement with\nobservation. We find that the spatial distribution of 56Ni and IMEs follows a\ncharacteristic hourglass shape. We discuss the implications of the asymmetric\ndistribution of 56Ni for the early-time gamma-ray observations of 56Ni from SN\n2014J. We suggest that DD mergers that agree with the light curves and spectra\nof normal SNe Ia will likely require a lower system mass.\n", "  It has been a long-standing puzzle why buckled dimers of the Si(001) surface\nappeared symmetric below 20 K in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nexperiments. Although such symmetric dimer images were concluded to be due to\nan artifact induced by STM measurements, its underlying mechanism is still\nveiled. Here,we demonstrate, based on a first-principles density-functional\ntheory calculation, that the symmetric dimer images are originated from the\nflip-flop motion of buckled dimers, driven by quantum tunneling (QT). It is\nrevealed that at low temperature the tunneling-induced surface charging with\nholes reduces the energy barrier for the flipping of buckled dimers, thereby\ngiving rise to a sizable QT-driven frequency of the flip-flop motion. However,\nsuch a QT phenomenon becomes marginal in the tunneling-induced surface charging\nwith electrons. Our findings provide an explanation for low-temperature STM\ndata that exhibits apparent symmetric (buckled) dimer structure in the\nfilled-state (empty-state) images.\n", "  The problem of a cold gas flowing past a stationary object is considered. It\nis shown that at large distances from the obstacle the shock front forms a\nparabolic solid of revolution. The interior of the shock front is obtained by\nsolution of the hydrodynamic equations in parabolic coordinates. The results\nare verified with a hydrodynamic simulation. The drag force and expected\nspectra are calculated for such shock, both in case of an optically thin and\nthick media. Finally, relations to astrophysical bow shocks and other analytic\nworks on oblique shocks are discussed.\n", "  An increase in the efficiency of sampling from Boltzmann distributions would\nhave a significant impact on deep learning and other machine-learning\napplications. Recently, quantum annealers have been proposed as a potential\ncandidate to speed up this task, but several limitations still bar these\nstate-of-the-art technologies from being used effectively. One of the main\nlimitations is that, while the device may indeed sample from a Boltzmann-like\ndistribution, quantum dynamical arguments suggest it will do so with an {\\it\ninstance-dependent} effective temperature, different from its physical\ntemperature. Unless this unknown temperature can be unveiled, it might not be\npossible to effectively use a quantum annealer for Boltzmann sampling. In this\nwork, we propose a strategy to overcome this challenge with a simple\neffective-temperature estimation algorithm. We provide a systematic study\nassessing the impact of the effective temperatures in the learning of a special\nclass of a restricted Boltzmann machine embedded on quantum hardware, which can\nserve as a building block for deep-learning architectures. We also provide a\ncomparison to $k$-step contrastive divergence (CD-$k$) with $k$ up to 100.\nAlthough assuming a suitable fixed effective temperature also allows us to\noutperform one step contrastive divergence (CD-1), only when using an\ninstance-dependent effective temperature do we find a performance close to that\nof CD-100 for the case studied here.\n", "  Collisions of white dwarfs (WDs) have recently been invoked as a possible\nmechanism for type Ia supernovae (SNIa). A pivotal feature for the viability of\nWD collisions as SNIa progenitors is that a significant fraction of the mass is\nhighly compressed to the densities required for efficient $^{56}$Ni production\nbefore the ignition of the detonation wave. Previous studies have predominantly\nemployed model WDs composed entirely of carbon-oxygen (CO), whereas WDs are\nexpected to have a non-negligible helium envelope. Given that helium is more\nsusceptible to explosive burning than CO under the conditions characteristic of\nWD collision, a legitimate concern is whether or not early time He detonation\nignition can translate to early time CO detonation, thereby drastically\nreducing $^{56}$Ni synthesis. We investigate the role of He in determining the\nfate of WD collisions by performing a series of two-dimensional hydrodynamics\ncalculations. We find that a necessary condition for non-trivial reduction of\nthe CO ignition time is that the He detonation birthed in the contact region\nsuccessfully propagates into the unshocked shell. We determine the minimal He\nshell mass as a function of the total WD mass that upholds this condition.\nAlthough we utilize a simplified reaction network similar to those used in\nprevious studies, our findings are in good agreement with detailed\ninvestigations concerning the impact of network size on He shell detonations.\nThis allows us to extend our results to the case with more realistic burning\nphysics. Based on the comparison of these findings against evolutionary\ncalculations of WD compositions, we conclude that most, if not all, WD\ncollisions will not be drastically impacted by their intrinsic He components.\n", "  Observations of luminous flares resulting from the possible tidal disruption\nof stars by supermassive black holes have raised a number of puzzles.\nOutstanding questions include the origin of the optical and ultraviolet (UV)\nflux, the weakness of hydrogen lines in the spectrum, and the occasional\nsimultaneous observation of x-rays. Here we study the emission from tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs) produced as radiation from black hole accretion\npropagates through an extended, optically thick envelope formed from stellar\ndebris. We analytically describe key physics controlling spectrum formation,\nand present detailed radiative transfer calculations that model the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and optical line strengths of TDEs near peak\nbrightness. The steady-state transfer is coupled to a non local thermodynamic\nequilibrium treatment of the excitation and ionization states of hydrogen,\nhelium and oxygen (as a representative metal). Our calculations show how an\nextended envelope can reprocess a fraction of soft x-rays and produce the\nobserved optical fluxes of order 10^43 ergs per second. Variations in the mass\nor size of the envelope may help explain how the optical flux changes over time\nwith roughly constant color. For high enough accretion luminosities, x-rays can\nhighly ionize the reprocessing region and escape to be observed simultaneously\nwith the optical flux, producing an SED not described by a single blackbody.\nDue to optical depth effects, hydrogen Balmer line emission is often strongly\nsuppressed relative to helium line emission (with HeII-to-H line ratios of at\nleast 5:1 in some cases) even in the disruption of a solar-composition star. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results to understanding the type of stars\ndestroyed in TDEs and the physical processes responsible for producing the\nobserved flares.\n", "  Recent discoveries of circumbinary planets in Kepler data show that there is\na viable channel of planet formation around binary main sequence stars.\nMotivated by these discoveries, we have investigated the caustic structures and\ndetectability of circumbinary planets in microlensing events. We have produced\na suite of animations of caustics as a function of the projected separation and\nangle of the binary host to efficiently explore caustic structures over the\nentire circumbinary parameter space. Aided by these animations, we have derived\na semi-empirical analytic expression for the location of planetary caustics,\nwhich are displaced in circumbinary lenses relative to those of planets with a\nsingle host. We have used this expression to show that the dominant source of\ncaustic motion will be due to the planet's orbital motion and not that of the\nbinary star. Finally, we estimate the fraction of circumbinary microlensing\nevents that are recognizable as such to be significant (5-50 percent) for\nbinary projected separations in the range 0.1-0.5 in units of Einstein radii.\n", "  We report magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements on underdoped\n$BaFe_2(As_{1-x}P_x)_2$ ($x=0.26$) that show enhanced superconductivity along\nstripes parallel to twin boundaries. These stripes of enhanced diamagnetic\nresponse repel vortices when we cool in a finite magnetic field and act as\nbarriers when we drag vortices with the magnetic MFM tip. The stripes disappear\nwhen we warm the sample towards the superconducting transition temperature. We\nshow that stripes can move when we warm the sample and comment on the\nrelationship between the stripes and similar stripes observed previously in\n$Ba(Fe_{1-x}Co_x)_2As_2$.\n", "  Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, such as WMAP and Planck,\nmeasure intensity anisotropies and build maps using a linearized formula for\nrelating them to the temperature blackbody fluctuations. However, this\nprocedure also generates a signal in the maps in the form of y-type distortions\nwhich is degenerate with the thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. These are\nsmall effects that arise at second-order in the temperature fluctuations not\nfrom primordial physics but from such a limitation of the map-making procedure.\nThey constitute a contaminant for measurements of: our peculiar velocity, the\ntSZ and primordial y-distortions. They can nevertheless be well-modeled and\naccounted for. We show that the distortions arise from a leakage of the CMB\ndipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles, mostly affecting the\nrange $\\ell$ < ~400. This should be visible in Planck's y-maps with an\nestimated signal-to-noise ratio of about 12. We note however that such\nfrequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the CMB\ndipole. This implies that the real significance of Planck's Doppler coupling\nmeasurements is actually lower than reported by the collaboration. Finally, we\nquantify the level of contamination in tSZ and primordial y-type distortions\nand show that it is above the sensitivity of proposed next generation CMB\nexperiments.\n", "  We calculate the correlation function of 79,091 galaxy clusters in the\nredshift region of $z \\leq 0.5$ selected from the WH15 cluster catalog. With a\nweight of cluster mass, a significant baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak is\ndetected on the correlation function with a significance of $3.7 \\sigma$. By\nfitting the correlation function with a $\\Lambda$CDM model curve, we find\n$D_v(z = 0.331) r_d^{fid}/r_d = 1261.5 \\pm 48$~Mpc which is consistent with the\nPlanck 2015 cosmology. We find that the correlation function of the higher mass\nsub-sample shows a higher amplitude at small scales of $r < 80~h^{-1}{\\rm\nMpc}$, which is consistent with our previous result. The 2D correlation\nfunction of this large sample of galaxy clusters shows a faint BAO ring with a\nsignificance of $1.8\\sigma$, from which we find that the distance scale\nparameters on directions across and along the line-of-sight are\n$\\alpha_{\\sigma} = 1.02 \\pm 0.06$ and $\\alpha_{\\pi} = 0.94 \\pm 0.10$,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present a new general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) code\nintegrated into the Athena++ framework. Improving upon the techniques used in\nmost GRMHD codes, ours allows the use of advanced, less diffusive Riemann\nsolvers, in particular HLLC and HLLD. We also employ a staggered-mesh\nconstrained transport algorithm suited for curvilinear coordinate systems in\norder to maintain the divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field. Our\ncode is designed to work with arbitrary stationary spacetimes in one, two, or\nthree dimensions, and we demonstrate its reliability in a number of tests. We\nalso report on its promising performance and scalability.\n", "  Quasars are the most luminous non-transient sources in the epoch of\ncosmological reionization (i.e., which ended a billion years after the Big\nBang, corresponding to a redshift of z ~ 5), and are powerful probes of the\ninter-galactic medium at that time. This review covers current efforts to\nidentify high-redshift quasars and how they have been used to constrain the\nreionization history. This includes a full description of the various processes\nby which neutral hydrogen atoms can absorb/scatter ultraviolet photons, and\nwhich lead to the Gunn-Peterson effect, dark gap and dark pixel analyses,\nquasar near zones and damping wing absorption. Finally, the future prospects\nfor using quasars as probes of reionization are described.\n", "  In this introductory chapter, we outline expectations for when and how the\nhydrogen and helium atoms in the universe turned from neutral to ionized,\nfocusing on the earliest, least well understood stages, and emphasizing the\nmost important open questions. We include a historical summary, and highlight\nthe role of reionization as one of the few milestones in the evolution of the\nuniverse since the Big Bang, and its status as a unique probe of the beginning\nstages of structure formation.\n", "  We suggest that the energetic radiation from core-collapse super-energetic\nsupernovae (SESNe) is due to a long lasting accretion process onto the newly\nborn neutron star (NS), resulting from an inefficient operation of the\njet-feedback mechanism. The jets that are launched by the accreting NS or black\nhole (BH) maintain their axis due to a rapidly rotating pre-collapse core, and\ndo not manage to eject core material from near the equatorial plane. The jets\nare able to eject material from the core along the polar directions, and reduce\nthe gravity near the equatorial plane. The equatorial gas expands, and part of\nit falls back over a timescale of minutes to days to prolong the jets-launching\nepisode. According to the model for SESNe proposed in the present paper, the\nprincipal parameter that distinguishes between the different cases of CCSN\nexplosions, such as between normal CCSNe and SESNe, is the efficiency of the\njet-feedback mechanism. This efficiency in turn depends on the pre-collapse\ncore mass, envelope mass, core convection, and most of all on the angular\nmomentum profile in the core. One prediction of the inefficient jet-feedback\nmechanism for SESNe is the formation of a slow equatorial outflow in the\nexplosion. Typical velocity and mass of this outflow are estimated to be\napproximately 1000 km/s and greater than about 1 solar mass, respectively,\nthough quantitative values will have to be checked in future hydrodynamic\nsimulations.\n", "  A simple, heuristic formula with parallels to the Drake Equation is\nintroduced to help focus discussion on open questions for the origins of life\nin a planetary context. This approach indicates a number of areas where\nquantitative progress can be made on parameter estimation for determining\norigins of life probabilities. We also suggest that the probability of origin\nof life events can be dramatically increased on planets with parallel\nchemistries that can undergo the development of complexity, and in solar\nsystems where more than one planet is available for chemical evolution, and\nwhere efficient impact ejecta exchange occurs, increasing the effective\nchemical search space and available time.\n", "  We provide a theoretical explanation for the optical modes observed in\ninelastic neutron scattering (INS) on the bcc solid phase of helium 4 [T.\nMarkovich, E. Polturak, J. Bossy, and E. Farhi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 195301\n(2002)]. We argue that these excitations are amplitude (Higgs) modes associated\nwith fluctuations of the crystal order parameter within the unit cell. We\npresent an analysis of the modes based on an effective Ginzburg-Landau model,\nclassify them according to their symmetry properties, and compute their\nsignature in INS experiments. In addition, we calculate the dynamical structure\nfactor by means of an ab intio quantum Monte Carlo simulation and find a finite\nfrequency excitation at zero relative momentum.\n", "  Studies of MHD turbulence often investigate the Fourier power spectrum to\nprovide information on the nature of the turbulence cascade. However, the\nFourier power spectrum only contains the Fourier amplitudes and rejects all\ninformation regarding the Fourier phases. Here we investigate the utility of\ntwo statistical diagnostics for recovering information on Fourier phases in ISM\ndensity data: the averaged amplitudes of the bispectrum and the phase coherence\nindex (PCI), a new phase technique for the ISM. We create 3D density and 2D\ncolumn density maps using a set of simulations of isothermal ideal MHD\nturbulence with a wide range of sonic and Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers. We find that\nthe bispectrum averaged along different angles with respect to either the $k_1$\nor $k_2$ axis is primarily sensitive to the sonic Mach number while averaging\nthe bispectral amplitudes over different annuli is sensitive to both the sonic\nand Alfv\\'enic Mach numbers. The PCI of density suggests that the most\ncorrelated phases occur in supersonic sub-Alfv\\'enic turbulence and also near\nthe numerical dissipation regime. This suggests that non-linear interactions\nwith correlated phases are strongest in shock dominated regions, in agreement\nwith findings from the solar wind. Additionally, our results are particularly\nencouraging as they suggests the phase information contained in the bispectrum\nand PCI can be used to find parameters of turbulence in column density maps.\n", "  A universal quantum computer requires a full set of basic quantum gates. With\nMajorana bound states one can form all necessary quantum gates in a\ntopologically protected way, bar one. In this manuscript we present a protocol\nthat achieves the missing, so called, $\\pi/8$ 'magic' phase gate. The protocol\nis based on the manipulation of geometric phases in a universal manner, and\ndoes not require fine tuning for distinct physical realizations. The protocol\nconverges exponentially with the number of steps in the geometric path.\nFurthermore, the magic gate protocol relies on the most basic hardware\npreviously suggested for topologically protected gates, and can be extended to\nany-phase-gate, where $\\pi/8$ is substituted by any $\\alpha$.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of the proposed SHiP experiment to the LQD operator\nin R-parity violating supersymmetric theories. We focus on single neutralino\nproduction via rare meson decays and the observation of downstream neutralino\ndecays into charged mesons inside the SHiP decay chamber. We provide a generic\nlist of effective operators and decay width formulae for any LQD coupling and\nshow the resulting expected SHiP sensitivity for a widespread list of benchmark\nscenarios via numerical simulations. We compare this sensitivity to expected\nlimits from testing the same decay topology at the LHC with ATLAS.\n", "  We consider a Weyl-invariant formulation of gravity with a cosmological\nconstant in d-dimensional spacetime and show that near two dimensions the\nclassical action reduces to the timelike Liouville action. We show that the\nrenormalized cosmological term leads to a nonlocal quantum momentum tensor\nwhich satisfies theWard identities in a nontrivial way. The resulting evolution\nequations for an isotropic, homogeneous universe lead to a slowly decaying\nvacuum energy and a power-law expansion. We outline the implications for the\ncosmological constant problem, inflation, and dark energy.\n", "  Structural distortions in nano-materials can induce dramatic changes in their\nelectronic properties. This situation is well manifested in graphene, a\ntwo-dimensional honeycomb structure of carbon atoms with only one atomic layer\nthickness. In particular, strained graphene can result in both charging effects\nand pseudo-magnetic fields, so that controlled strain on a perfect graphene\nlattice can be tailored to yield desirable electronic properties. Here we\ndescribe the theoretical foundation for strain-engineering of the electronic\nproperties of graphene, and then provide experimental evidences for\nstrain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields and charging effects in monolayer\ngraphene. We further demonstrate the feasibility of nanoscale strain\nengineering for graphene-based devices by means of theoretical simulations and\nnano-fabrication technology.\n", "  Inflation due to a non-minimally coupled scalar field with a large\nnon-minimal coupling, as first proposed by Salopek, Bardeen and Bond (SBB), is\nin good agreement with the observed value of the spectral index and constraints\non the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Here we explore the possibility that SBB\ninflation represents the late stage of a Universe which emerges from an early\ncontracting era. We present a model in which the Universe smoothly transitions\nfrom an anamorphic contracting era to late-time SBB inflation without\nencountering a singular bounce. This corresponds to a continuous expansion in\nthe Einstein frame throughout. We show that the anamorphic contracting era is\nable to provide the smooth superhorizon initial conditions necessary for\nsubsequent SBB inflation to occur. The model predicts corrections to the\nnon-minimal coupling, kinetic term and potential of SBB inflation which can\nobservably increase the observed spectral index relative to its SBB prediction.\n", "  We use basic physics and simple mathematics accessible to advanced\nundergraduate students to estimate the main properties of neutron stars. We set\nthe stage and introduce relevant concepts by discussing the properties of\n\"everyday\" matter on Earth, degenerate Fermi gases, white dwarfs, and scaling\nrelations of stellar properties with polytropic equations of state. Then, we\ndiscuss various physical ingredients relevant for neutron stars and how they\ncan be combined in order to obtain a couple of different simple estimates of\ntheir maximum mass, beyond which they would collapse, turning into black holes.\nFinally, we use the basic structural parameters of neutron stars to briefly\ndiscuss their rotational and electromagnetic properties.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new Kepler transiting circumbinary planet (CBP).\nThis latest addition to the still-small family of CBPs defies the current trend\nof known short-period planets orbiting near the stability limit of binary\nstars. Unlike the previous discoveries, the planet revolving around the\neclipsing binary system Kepler-1647 has a very long orbital period (~1100 days)\nand was at conjunction only twice during the Kepler mission lifetime. Due to\nthe singular configuration of the system, Kepler-1647b is not only the\nlongest-period transiting CBP at the time of writing, but also one of the\nlongest-period transiting planets. With a radius of 1.06+/-0.01 RJup it is also\nthe largest CBP to date. The planet produced three transits in the light-curve\nof Kepler-1647 (one of them during an eclipse, creating a syzygy) and\nmeasurably perturbed the times of the stellar eclipses, allowing us to measure\nits mass to be 1.52+/-0.65 MJup. The planet revolves around an 11-day period\neclipsing binary consisting of two Solar-mass stars on a slightly inclined,\nmildly eccentric (e_bin = 0.16), spin-synchronized orbit. Despite having an\norbital period three times longer than Earth's, Kepler-1647b is in the\nconservative habitable zone of the binary star throughout its orbit.\n", "  We study the interplay between population imbalance in a two-component\nfermionic system and nearest-neighbor interaction using matrix product states\nmethod. Our analysis reveals the existence of a new type of\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov phase in the presence of competing\ninteractions. Furthermore, we find distinct evidence for the presence of hidden\norder in the system. We present an effective model to understand the emergent\noscillations in the string correlations due to the imbalance, and show how they\ncan become an efficient tool to investigate systems with imbalance.\n", "  In this paper we present calculations of the UV luminosity function from the\nDark-ages Reionization And Galaxy-formation Observables from Numerical\nSimulations (DRAGONS) project, which combines N-body, semi-analytic and\nsemi-numerical modelling designed to study galaxy formation during the Epoch of\nReionization. Using galaxy formation physics including supernova feedback, the\nmodel naturally reproduces the UV LFs for high-redshift star-forming galaxies\nfrom $z{\\sim}5$ through to $z{\\sim}10$. We investigate the luminosity--star\nformation rate (SFR) relation, finding that variable SFR histories of galaxies\nresult in a scatter around the median relation of $0.1$--$0.3$ dex depending on\nUV luminosity. We find close agreement between the model and observationally\nderived SFR functions. We use our calculated luminosities to investigate the\nluminosity function below current detection limits, and the ionizing photon\nbudget for reionization. We predict that the slope of the UV LF remains steep\nbelow current detection limits and becomes flat at\n$M_\\mathrm{UV}{\\gtrsim}{-14}$. We find that $48$ ($17$) per cent of the total\nUV flux at $z{\\sim}6$ ($10$) has been detected above an observational limit of\n$M_\\mathrm{UV}{\\sim}{-17}$, and that galaxies fainter than\n$M_\\mathrm{UV}{\\sim}{-17}$ are the main source of ionizing photons for\nreionization. We investigate the luminosity--stellar mass relation, and find a\ncorrelation for galaxies with $M_\\mathrm{UV}{<}{-14}$ that has the form\n$M_*{\\propto}10^{-0.47M_\\mathrm{UV}}$, in good agreement with observations, but\nwhich flattens for fainter galaxies. We determine the luminosity--halo mass\nrelation to be $M_\\mathrm{vir}{\\propto}10^{-0.35M_\\mathrm{UV}}$, finding that\ngalaxies with $M_\\mathrm{UV}{=}{-20}$ reside in host dark matter haloes of\n$10^{11.0\\pm 0.1}\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ at $z{\\sim}6$, and that this mass decreases\ntowards high redshift.\n", "  Water is a polar solvent and hence supports the bulk dissociation of itself\nand its solutes into ions, and the re-association of these ions into neutral\nmolecules in a dynamic equilibrium, e.g., ${\\rm H_2O_2}\\leftrightharpoons {\\rm\nH^+~+~HO_2^-}$. Using continuum theory, we study the influence of these\nreactions on the self-propulsion of colloids driven by surface chemical\nreactions (chemical swimmers) in aqueous solution. The association-dissociation\nreactions are here shown to have a strong influence on the swimmers' behaviour,\nand must therefore be included in future modelling. In particular, such bulk\nreactions permit charged swimmers to propel electrophoretically even if all\nspecies involved in the surface reactions are neutral. The bulk reactions also\nsignificantly modify the predicted speed of chemical swimmers propelled by\nionic currents, by up to an order of magnitude. For swimmers whose surface\nreactions produce both anions and cations (ionic self-diffusiophoresis), the\nbulk reactions produce an additional reactive screening length, analogous to\nthe Debye length in electrostatics. This in turn leads to an inverse\nrelationship between swimmer radius and swimming speed, which could provide an\nalternative explanation for recent experimental observations on Pt-polystyrene\nJanus swimmers [S. Ebbens et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 020401 (2012)]. We also use\nour continuum theory to investigate the effect of the Debye screening length\nitself, going beyond the infinitely thin limit approximation used by previous\nanalytical theories. We identify significant departures from this limiting\nbehavior for micron-sized swimmers under typical experimental conditions, and\nfind that the limiting behavior fails entirely for nanoscale swimmers.\n", "  We construct a generic model of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM). Starting\nwith two Weyl spinor multiplets $\\eta_{1,2}\\sim (I,\\mp Y)$ coupled to the\nStandard Model (SM) Higgs, six additional Weyl spinor multiplets with $(I\\pm\n1/2, \\pm(Y\\pm 1/2))$ are needed in general. It has 13 parameters in total, five\nmass parameters and eight Yukawa couplings. The DM sector of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is a special case of the model with\n$(I,Y)=(1/2,1/2)$. Therefore, this model can be viewed as an extension of the\nneutralino DM sector. We consider three typical cases: the neutralino-like, the\nreduced and the extended cases. For each case, we survey the DM mass $m_\\chi$\nin the range of $(1,2500)$ GeV by random sampling from the model parameter\nspace and study the constraints from the observed DM relic density, the direct\nsearch of LUX, XENON100 and PICO experiments, and the indirect search of\nFermi-LAT data. We investigate the interplay of these constraints and the\ndifferences among these cases. It is found that the direct detection of\nspin-independent DM scattering off nuclei and the indirect detection of DM\nannihilation to $W^+W^-$ channel are more sensitive to the DM searches in the\nnear future. The allowed mass for finding $\\tilde H$-, $\\tilde B$-, $\\tilde W$-\nand non neutralino-like DM particles and the predictions on $\\langle\\sigma\n(\\chi{\\chi}\\rightarrow ZZ, ZH, t{\\bar t}) v\\rangle$ in the indirect search are\ngiven.\n", "  We show that there exist supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional, pure,\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ Supergravity such that the norm of the supersymmetric Killing\nvector, built out of the Killing spinor, is a real not-everywhere analytic\nfunction such that all its derivatives vanish at a point where the Killing\nvector field becomes null. The norm of the Killing vector field then is not an\nanalytic function on a neighborhood around this point. We explicitly construct\nsuch solutions by using a multi-center Gibbons-Hawking base. Although many of\nthese solutions have infinite charges, we find explicit examples with finite\ncharges that asymptote to $AdS_3\\times S_2$ and discuss their physical\ninterpretation.\n", "  We discuss the physical interpretation of stress-energy tensors that source\nstatic spherically symmetric Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the sources of\nsuch metrics with no curvature singularities or horizons do not simultaneously\nsatisfy the weak and strong energy conditions. Sensible stress-energy tensors\nusually satisfy both of them. Under most circumstances these sources are not\nperfect fluids and contain shear stresses. We show that for these systems the\nclassical double copy associates the electric charge density to the Komar\nenergy density. In addition, we demonstrate that the stress-energy tensors are\ndetermined by the electric charge density and their conservation equations.\n", "  We report the observation and confirmation of the first group- and\ncluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in Dark Energy Survey\n(DES) data. Through visual inspection of data from the Science Verification\n(SV) season, we identified 53 candidate systems. We then obtained spectroscopic\nfollow-up of 21 candidates using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at\nthe Gemini South telescope and the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and\nSpectrograph (IMACS) at the Magellan/Baade telescope. With this follow-up, we\nconfirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: Three of the systems are\nnewly discovered, and the remaining three were previously known. Of the 21\nobserved candidates, the remaining 15 were either not detected in spectroscopic\nobservations, were observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectral\nfeatures), or were ruled out as lensing systems. The confirmed sample consists\nof one group-scale and five galaxy cluster-scale lenses. The lensed sources\nrange in redshift z ~ 0.80-3.2, and in i-band surface brightness i_{SB} ~ 23-25\nmag/sq.-arcsec. (2\" aperture). For each of the six systems, we estimate the\nEinstein radius and the enclosed mass, which have ranges ~ 5.0 - 8.6\" and ~ 7.5\nx 10^{12} - 6.4 x 10^{13} solar masses, respectively.\n", "  We take a pragmatic, model independent approach to single field slow-roll\ncanonical inflation by imposing conditions, not on the potential, but on the\nslow-roll parameter $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ and its derivatives $\\epsilon^{\\prime\n}(\\phi)$ and $\\epsilon^{\\prime\\prime }(\\phi)$, thereby extracting general\nconditions on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the running $n_{sk}$ at\n$\\phi_{H}$ where the perturbations are produced, some $50$ $-$ $60$ $e$-folds\nbefore the end of inflation. We find quite generally that for models where\n$\\epsilon(\\phi)$ develops a maximum, a relatively large $r$ is most likely\naccompanied by a positive running while a negligible tensor-to-scalar ratio\nimplies negative running. The definitive answer, however, is given in terms of\nthe slow-roll parameter $\\xi_2(\\phi)$. To accommodate a large tensor-to-scalar\nratio that meets the limiting values allowed by the Planck data, we study a\nnon-monotonic $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ decreasing during most part of inflation. Since\nat $\\phi_{H}$ the slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ is increasing, we thus\nrequire that $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ develops a maximum for $\\phi > \\phi_{H}$ after\nwhich $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ decrease to small values where most $e$-folds are\nproduced. The end of inflation might occur trough a hybrid mechanism and a\nsmall field excursion $\\Delta\\phi_e\\equiv |\\phi_H-\\phi_e |$ is obtained with a\nsufficiently thin profile for $\\epsilon(\\phi)$ which, however, should not\nconflict with the second slow-roll parameter $\\eta(\\phi)$. As a consequence of\nthis analysis we find bounds for $\\Delta \\phi_e$, $r_H$ and for the scalar\nspectral index $n_{sH}$. Finally we provide examples where these considerations\nare explicitly realised.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the coupling at zero magnetic field of an\nisotopically pure erbium doped yttrium orthosilicate crystal ($^{167}$Er:YSO)\nto a three-dimensional superconducting cavity with a $Q$ factor of $10^5$. A\ntunable loop-gap resonator is used, and its resonance frequency is tuned to\nobserve the hyperfine transitions of the erbium sample. The observed spectrum\ndiffers from what is predicted by the published spin Hamiltonian parameters.\nThe narrow cavity linewidth also enables the observation of asymmetric line\nshapes for these hyperfine transitions. Such a broadly tunable superconducting\ncavity (from 1.6 GHz to 4.0 GHz in the current design) is a promising device\nfor building hybrid quantum systems.\n", "  We demonstrate the extension of coherence between all four two-electron spin\nground states of an InAs quantum dot molecule (QDM) via non-local suppression\nof nuclear spin fluctuations in both constituent quantum dots (QDs), while\noptically addressing only the upper QD transitions. Long coherence times are\nrevealed through dark-state spectroscopy as resulting from nuclear spin locking\nmediated by the exchange interaction between the QDs. Lineshape analysis\nprovides the first measurement of the quieting of the Overhauser field\ndistribution correlating with reduced nuclear spin fluctuations.\n", "  Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy\nevolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law\nin the distant Universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of galaxies at z = 1.5--3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR\nimaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount\nof inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some\nindividual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law\nover another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the\nplane of infrared excess (IRX, $L_{\\text{TIR}}/L_{\\text{UV}}$) and UV slope\n($\\beta$). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model,\n$A_{\\lambda,\\delta}=E(B-V)\\ k_\\lambda\\ (\\lambda/\\lambda_V)^\\delta$ where\n$k_\\lambda$ is the dust law of Calzetti et al. (2000), and show that there\nexists a correlation between the color excess ${E(B-V)}$ and tilt $\\delta$ with\n${\\delta=(0.62\\pm0.05)\\log(E(B-V))}$+ ${(0.26~\\pm~0.02)}$. Galaxies with high\ncolor excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color\nexcess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample\nshow no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass,\nstar-formation rate, or $\\beta$. The change in the dust law with color excess\nis consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a\nmixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age,\nmetallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows\npotential to constrain the dust law at even higher ($z>3$) redshifts.\n", "  We discuss a non-relativistic contraction of massive and massless field\ntheories minimally coupled to gravity. Using the non-relativistic limiting\nprocedure introduced in our previous work, we (re-)derive non-relativistic\nfield theories of massive and massless spins 0 to 3/2 coupled to torsionless\nNewton-Cartan backgrounds. We elucidate the relativistic origin of the\nNewton-Cartan central charge gauge field $m_\\mu$ and explain its relation to\nparticle number conservation.\n", "  We provide constraints on the accuracy with which the neutrino mass fraction,\n$f_{\\nu}$, can be estimated when exploiting measurements of redshift-space\ndistortions, describing in particular how the error on neutrino mass depends on\nthree fundamental parameters of a characteristic galaxy redshift survey:\ndensity, halo bias and volume. In doing this, we make use of a series of dark\nmatter halo catalogues extracted from the BASICC simulation. The mock data are\nanalysed via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo likelihood analysis. We find a fitting\nfunction that well describes the dependence of the error on bias, density and\nvolume, showing a decrease in the error as the bias and volume increase, and a\ndecrease with density down to an almost constant value for high density values.\nThis fitting formula allows us to produce forecasts on the precision achievable\nwith future surveys on measurements of the neutrino mass fraction. For example,\na Euclid-like spectroscopic survey should be able to measure the neutrino mass\nfraction with an accuracy of $\\delta f_{\\nu} \\approx 6.7\\times10^{-4}$, using\nredshift-space clustering once all the other cosmological parameters are kept\nfixed to the $\\Lambda$CDM case.\n", "  By using the newtonian gauge, we re-confirm that, as in the minimal case, the\nre-scaled Mukhanov-Sasaki variable is conserved leading to a constraint\nequation for the Newtonian potential. However, conversely to the minimal case,\nin Horndeski theories, the super-horizon Newtonian potential can potentially\ngrow to very large values after inflation exit. If that happens, inflationary\npredictability is lost during the oscillating period. When this does not\nhappen, the perturbations generated during inflation can be standardly related\nto the CMB, if the theory chosen is minimal at low energies. As a concrete\nexample, we analytically and numerically discuss the new Higgs inflationary\ncase. There, the Inflaton is the Higgs boson that is non-minimally kinetically\ncoupled to gravity. During the high-energy part of the post-inflationary\noscillations, the system is anisotropic and the Newtonian potential is largely\namplified. Thanks to the smallness of today's amplitude of curvature\nperturbations, however, the system stays in the linear regime, so that\ninflationary predictions are not lost. At low energies, when the system relaxes\nto the minimal case, the anisotropies disappear and the Newtonian potential\nconverges to a constant value. We show that the constant value to which the\nNewtonian potential converges is related to the frozen part of curvature\nperturbations during inflation, precisely like in the minimal case.\n", "  Control at the interface between the classical and the quantum world is\nfundamental in quantum physics. In particular, how classical control is\nenhanced by coherence effects is an important question both from a theoretical\nas well as from a technological point of view. In this work, we establish a\nresource theory describing this setting and explore relations to the theory of\ncoherence, entanglement and information processing. Specifically, for the\ncoherent control of quantum systems the relevant resources of entanglement and\ncoherence are found to be equivalent and closely related to a measure of\ndiscord. The results are then applied to the DQC1 protocol and the precision of\nthe final measurement is expressed in terms of the available resources.\n", "  Non-observation of superpartners of the Standard Model particles at the early\nruns of the LHC provide strong motivation for an $R$-symmetric minimal\nsupersymmetric Standard Model, or MRSSM. This model also comes with a pair of\nextra scalars which couple only to superpartners at the tree level. We\ndemonstrate that in the limit when the $U(1)_R$ symmetry is broken, one of\nthese scalars develops all the properties necessary to explain the 750 GeV\ndiphoton resonance recently observed at the LHC, as well as the non-observation\nof associated signals in other channels. Some confirmatory tests in the\nupcoming LHC runs are proposed.\n", "  Equilibrium shapes of coalesced pendular bridges in a static assembly of\nspherical beads are computed by numerical minimization of the interfacial\nenergy. Our present study focuses on generic bead configurations involving\nthree beads, one of which is in contact to the two others while there is a gap\nof variable size between the latter. In agreement with previous experimental\nstudies, we find interfacial `trimer' morphologies consisting of three\ncoalesced pendular bridges, and `dimers' of two coalesced bridges. In a certain\nrange of the gap opening we observe a bistability between the dimer and trimer\nmorphology during shrinking and growth. The magnitude of the corresponding\ncapillary forces in presence of a trimer or dimer depends, besides the gap\nopening only on the volume or Laplace pressure of liquid. For a given Laplace\npressure, the capillary forces in presence of a trimer are slightly larger than\nthe force of a single bridges at the same gap opening, which could explain the\nshallow maximum and plateau of the capillary cohesion of a wetting liquid for\nsaturations in the funicular regime.\n", "  We report a candidate centi-parsec supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in\nthe radio-quiet quasar SDSS J0159+0105 at z=0.217. With a modified lomb-scargle\ncode GLSdeDRW and the auto-correlation analysis ACF, we detect two significant\n(at P>99%) periodic signals at ~741 day and ~1500 day from the 8.1-year\nCatalina V-band light curve of this quasar. The period ratio, which is close to\n1:2, is typical of a black-hole binary system with a mass ratio of 0.05<q<0.8\naccording to recent numerical simulations. SDSS J0159+0105 has two SDSS\nspectroscopic observations separated by ~10 years. There is a significant\nchange in the broad H-beta profile between the two epochs, which can be\nexplained by a single broad-line region (BLR) around the binary system\nilluminated by the aforementioned mini-disks, or a stream of gas flowing from\nthe circumbinary disk to one of the SMBHs. From the single BLR assumption and\nthe orbital period t_orb ~1500 day, we estimate the total virial masses of\nM_SMBHB ~ 1.3x10^8 M_sun, the average distances of BLR of ~0.04pc (~50\nlight-day, with +/-0.3 dex uncertainty), and a SMBHB separation of d=\n(0.01pc)M_{8,tot}^{1/3} (T_rest/3.3yr)^{2/3} ~ 0.013 pc (15 light-day). Based\non analytical work, the postulated circumbinary disk has an inner radius of 2d\n= 0.026 pc (30 light-day). SDSS J0159+0105 also displays unusual spectral\nenergy distribution. The unique properties of SDSS J0159+0105 are consistent\nwith it being a centi-parsec SMBHB.\n  The GLSdeDRW code link: http://butler.lab.asu.edu/qso_period/\n", "  We present a new method to measure the redshift-dependent galaxy bias by\ncombining information from the galaxy density field and the weak lensing field.\nThis method is based on Amara et al. (2012), where they use the galaxy density\nfield to construct a bias-weighted convergence field kg. The main difference\nbetween Amara et al. (2012) and our new implementation is that here we present\nanother way to measure galaxy bias using tomography instead of bias\nparameterizations. The correlation between kg and the true lensing field k\nallows us to measure galaxy bias using different zero-lag correlations, such as\n<kgk>/<kk> or <kgkg>/<kgk>. Our method measures the linear bias factor on\nlinear scales under the assumption of no stochasticity between galaxies and\nmatter. We use the MICE simulation to measure the linear galaxy bias for a\nflux-limited sample (i < 22.5) in tomographic redshift bins using this method.\nThis paper is the first that studies the accuracy and systematic uncertainties\nassociated with the implementation of the method, and the regime where it is\nconsistent with the linear galaxy bias defined by projected 2-point correlation\nfunctions (2PCF). We find that our method is consistent with linear bias at the\npercent level for scales larger than 30 arcmin, while nonlinearities appear at\nsmaller scales. This measurement is a good complement to other measurements of\nbias, since it does not depend strongly on sigma8 as the 2PCF measurements. We\napply this method to the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification data in a\nfollow-up paper.\n", "  We investigate the growth histories of dark matter halos associated with\ndwarf satellites in Local Group galaxies and the resultant evolution of the\nbaryonic component. Our model is based on the recently proposed property that\nthe mean surface density of a dark halo inside a radius at maximum circular\nvelocity V_max is universal over a large range of V_max. Following that this\nsurface density of 20 Msun/pc^2 well explains dwarf satellites in the Milky Way\nand Andromeda, we find that the evolution of the dark halo in this common\nsurface-density scale is characterized by the rapid increase of the halo mass\nassembled by the redshift z_TT of the tidal truncation by its host halo, at\nearly epochs of z_TT >~ 6 or V_max <~ 22 km/s. This mass growth of the halo is\nslow at lower z_TT or larger V_max. Taking into account the baryon content in\nthis dark halo evolution, under the influence of the ionizing background\nradiation, we find that the dwarf satellites are divided into roughly two\nfamilies: those with V_max <~ 22 km/s having high star formation efficiency and\nthose with larger V_max having less efficient star formation. This\nsemi-analytical model is in good agreement with the high-resolution numerical\nsimulation for galaxy formation and with the observed star formation histories\nfor Fornax and Leo~II. This suggests that the evolution of a dark halo plays a\nkey role in understanding star formation histories in dwarf satellites.\n", "  We report on the first joint analysis of observational signatures from the\nelectroweak baryogenesis in both gravitational wave (GW) detectors and particle\ncolliders. With an effective extension of the Higgs sector in terms of the\ndimension-6 operators, we derive a strong first-order phase transition in\nassociated with a sizable CP violation to realize a successful electroweak\nbaryogenesis. We calculate the GW spectrum resulting from the bubble\nnucleation, plasma transportation, and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence of this\nprocess that occurred after the big bang, and find that it yields GW signals\ntestable in Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, Deci-hertz\nInterferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer. We further\nidentify collider signals from the same mechanism that are observable at the\nplanning Circular Electron Positron Collider. Our analysis bridges\nastrophysics/cosmology with particle physics by providing significant\nmotivation for searches for GW event peaking at the $(10^{-4}, 1)$ Hz range,\nwhich are associated with signals at colliders, and highlights the possibility\nof an interdisciplinary observational window into baryogenesis. The technique\napplied in analyzing early universe phase transitions may enlighten the study\nof phase transitions in applied science.\n", "  We have applied the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to\nastrophysics by extending the corresponding analysis to the magnetic dipole\ninteraction characterizing the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line. Although it is\nunlikely that superradiance could take place in thermally relaxed regions and\nthat the lack of observational evidence of masers for this transition reduces\nthe probability of detecting superradiance, in situations where the conditions\nnecessary for superradiance are met (i.e., close atomic spacing, high velocity\ncoherence, population inversion, and long dephasing time-scales compared to\nthose related to coherent behavior), our results suggest that relatively low\nlevels of population inversion over short astronomical length-scales (e.g., as\ncompared to those required for maser amplification) can lead to the cooperative\nbehavior required for superradiance in the ISM. Given the results of our\nanalysis, we expect the observational properties of 21-cm superradiance to be\ncharacterized by the emission of high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like\nfeatures potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to\ndays.\n", "  We study braiding statistics between quasiparticles and vortices in\ntwo-dimensional charge-$2m$ (in units of $e$) superconductors that are coupled\nto a $\\mathbb Z_{2m}$ dynamical gauge field, where $m$ is any positive integer.\nWe show that there exist $16m$ types of braiding statistics when $m$ is odd,\nbut only $4m$ types when $m$ is even. Based on the braiding statistics, we\nobtain a classification of topological phases of charge-$2m$\nsuperconductors---or formally speaking, a classification of symmetry-protected\ntopological phases, as well as invertible topological phases, of\ntwo-dimensional gapped fermions with $\\mathbb Z_{2m}^f$ symmetry.\nInterestingly, we find that there is no nontrivial fermionic symmetry-protected\ntopological phase with $\\mathbb Z_4^f$ symmetry.\n", "  Bulk superconductivity has been discovered in Tl_{0.6}Bi_{2}Te_{3}, which is\nderived from the topological insulator Bi2Te3. The superconducting volume\nfraction of up to 95% (determined from specific heat) with Tc of 2.28 K was\nobserved. The carriers are p-type with the density of ~1.8 x 10^{20} cm^{-3}.\nResistive transitions under magnetic fields point to an unconventional\ntemperature dependence of the upper critical field B_{c2}. The crystal\nstructure appears to be unchanged from Bi2Te3 with a shorter c-lattice\nparameter, which, together with the Rietveld analysis, suggests that Tl ions\nare incorporated but not intercalated. This material is an interesting\ncandidate of a topological superconductor which may be realized by the strong\nspin-orbit coupling inherent to topological insulators.\n", "  Fast entangling gates have been proposed for trapped ions that are orders of\nmagnitude faster than current implementations. We present here a detailed\nanalysis of the challenges involved in performing a successful fast gate. We\nshow that the RWA is a stable approximation with respect to pulse numbers: the\ntimescale on which we can neglect terms rotating at the atomic frequency is\nnegligibly affected by the number of pulses in the fast gate. In contrast, we\nshow that the laser pulse instability does give rise to a pulse-number\ndependent effect; the fast gate infidelity is compounded with the number of\napplied imperfect pulses. Using a dimensional reduction method presented here,\nwe find bounds on the pulse stability required to achieve two-qubit gate\nfidelity thresholds.\n", "  Globular clusters are ancient stellar populations with no star formation or\ncore-collapse supernovae. Several lines of evidence suggest that globular\nclusters are rich in planets. If so, and if advanced civilizations can develop\nthere, then the distances between these civilizations and other stars would be\nfar smaller than typical distances between stars in the Galactic disk. The\nrelative proximity would facilitate interstellar communication and travel.\nHowever, the very proximity that promotes interstellar travel also brings\ndanger, since stellar interactions can destroy planetary systems. However, by\nmodeling globular clusters and their stellar populations, we find that large\nregions of many globular clusters can be thought of as \"sweet spots\" where\nhabitable-zone planetary orbits can be stable for long times. We also compute\nthe ambient densities and fluxes in the regions within which habitable-zone\nplanets can survive. Globular clusters are among the best targets for searches\nfor extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). We use the Drake equation to compare\nglobular clusters to the Galactic disk, in terms of the likelihood of housing\nadvanced communicating civilizations. We also consider free-floating planets,\nsince wide-orbit planets can be ejected and travel freely through the cluster.\nA civilization spawned in a globular cluster may have opportunities to\nestablish self-sustaining outposts, thereby reducing the probability that a\nsingle catastrophic event will destroy the civilization or its descendants.\nAlthough individual civilizations within a cluster may follow different\nevolutionary paths, or even be destroyed, the cluster may always host some\nadvanced civilization, once a small number of them have managed to jump across\ninterstellar space.\n", "  By means of density functional theory based calculations, we study the role\nof spin-orbit coupling in the new family of ABC hyperferroelectrics [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 112, 127601 (2014)]. We unveil an extremely rich physics strongly linked\nto ferroelectric properties, ranging from the electric control of bulk Rashba\neffect to the existence of a three dimensional topological insulator phase,\nwith concomitant topological surface states even in the ultrathin film limit.\nMoreover, we predict that the topological transition, as induced by alloying,\nis followed by a Weyl semi-metal phase of finite concentration extension, which\nis robust against disorder, putting forward hyperferroelectrics as promising\ncandidates for spin-orbitronic applications.\n", "  The quasi-two-dimensional nickelate La4Ni3O8 (La-438) is an anion deficient\nn=3 Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) phase that consists of trilayer networks of square\nplanar Ni ions, formally assigned as Ni1+ and Ni2+ in a 2:1 ratio. While\nprevious studies on polycrystalline samples have identified a 105 K phase\ntransition with a pronounced electronic and magnetic response but weak lattice\ncharacter, no consensus on the origin of this transition has been reached. Here\nwe show using synchrotron x-ray diffraction on high-pO2 floating-zone grown\nsingle crystals that this transition is driven by a real space ordering of\ncharge into a quasi-2D charge stripe ground state. The charge stripe\nsuperlattice propagation vector, q=(2/3, 0, 1), corresponds with that found in\nthe related 1/3-hole doped single layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate,\nLa5/3Sr1/3NiO4 (LSNO-1/3, Ni2.33+) with orientation at 45-degrees to the Ni-O\nbonds. Like LSNO-1/3, the charge stripes in La-438 are weakly correlated along\nthe c axis to form a staggered ABAB stacking that minimizes the Coulomb\nrepulsion among the stripes. Surprisingly, however, we find that the charge\nstripes within each trilayer of La-438 are stacked in phase from one layer to\nthe next, at odds with any simple Coulomb repulsion argument.\n", "  We compute the transport coefficients (drag and momentum diffusion) of the\nlow-lying heavy baryons $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\Lambda_b$ in a medium of light mesons\nformed at the later stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We employ the\nFokker-Planck approach to obtain the transport coefficients from unitarized\nbaryon-meson interactions based on effective field theories that respect chiral\nand heavy-quark symmetries. We provide the transport coefficients as a function\nof temperature and heavy-baryon momentum, and analyze the applicability of\ncertain nonrelativistic estimates. Moreover we compare our outcome for the\nspatial diffusion coefficient to the one coming from the solution of the\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport equation and we find a very good\nagreement between both calculations. The transport coefficients for $\\Lambda_c$\nand $\\Lambda_b$ in a thermal bath will be used in a subsequent publication as\ninput in a Langevin evolution code for the generation and propagation of heavy\nparticles in heavy-ion collisions at LHC and RHIC energies.\n", "  Energy flow in bio-molecular motors and machines are vital to their function.\nYet experimental observations are often limited to a small subset of variables\nthat participate in energy transport and dissipation. Here we show, through a\nsolvable Langevin model, that the seemingly hidden entropy production is\nmeasurable through the violation spectrum of the fluctuation-response relation\nof a slow observable. For general Markov systems with timescale separation, we\nprove that the violation spectrum exhibits a characteristic plateau in the\nintermediate frequency region. Despite its vanishing height, the plateau can\naccount for energy dissipation over a broad timescale. Our findings suggest a\ngeneral possibility to probe hidden entropy production in nano systems without\ndirect observation of fast variables.\n", "  We present HST STIS optical transmission spectroscopy of the cool Saturn-mass\nexoplanet WASP-39b from 0.29-1.025 micron, along with complementary transit\nobservations from Spitzer IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. The low density and large\natmospheric pressure scale height ofWASP-39b make it particularly amenable to\natmospheric characterization using this technique. We detect a Rayleigh\nscattering slope as well as sodium and potassium absorption features; this is\nthe first exoplanet in which both alkali features are clearly detected with the\nextended wings predicted by cloud-free atmosphere models. The full transmission\nspectrum is well matched by a clear, H2-dominated atmosphere or one containing\na weak contribution from haze, in good agreement with the preliminary reduction\nof these data presented in Sing et al. (2016). WASP-39b is predicted to have a\npressure-temperature profile comparable to that of HD 189733b and WASP-6b,\nmaking it one of the coolest transiting gas giants observed in our HST STIS\nsurvey. Despite this similarity, WASP-39b appears to be largely cloud-free\nwhile the transmission spectra of HD 189733b and WASP-6b both indicate the\npresence of high altitude clouds or hazes. These observations further emphasize\nthe surprising diversity of cloudy and cloud-free gas giant planets in\nshort-period orbits and the corresponding challenges associated with developing\npredictive cloud models for these atmospheres.\n", "  The Lang-Firsov Hamiltonian, a well-known solvable model of interacting\nfermion-boson system with sideband features in the fermion spectral weight, is\ngeneralized to have the time-dependent fermion-boson coupling constant. We show\nhow to derive the two-time Green's function for the time-dependent problem in\nthe adiabatic limit, defined as the slow temporal variation of the coupling\nover the characteristic oscillator period. The idea we use in deriving the\nGreen's function is akin to the use of instantaneous basis states in solving\nthe adiabatic evolution problem in quantum mechanics. With such \"adiabatic\nGreen's function\" at hand we analyze the transient behavior of the spectral\nweight as the coupling is gradually tuned to zero. Time-dependent\ngeneralization of a related model, the spin-boson Hamiltonian, is analyzed in\nthe same way. In both cases the sidebands arising from the fermion-boson\ncoupling can be seen to gradually lose their spectral weights over time.\nConnections of our solution to the two-dimensional Dirac electrons coupled to\nquantized photons are discussed.\n", "  The latest analysis efforts in reverberation mapping are beginning to allow\nreconstruction of echo images (or velocity-delay maps) that encode information\nabout the structure and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs). Such maps can constrain sophisticated physical models\nfor the BLR. The physical picture of the BLR is often theorized to be a\nphotoionized wind launched from the AGN accretion disk. Previously we showed\nthat the line-driven disk wind solution found in an earlier simulation by Proga\nand Kallman is virialized over a large distance from the disk. This finding\nimplies that, according to this model, black hole masses can be reliably\nestimated through reverberation mapping techniques. However, predictions of\necho images expected from line-driven disk winds are not available. Here, after\npresenting the necessary radiative transfer methodology, we carry out the first\ncalculations of such predictions. We find that the echo images are quite\nsimilar to other virialized BLR models such as randomly orbiting clouds and\nthin Keplerian disks. We conduct a parameter survey exploring how echo images,\nline profiles, and transfer functions depend on both the inclination angle and\nthe line opacity. We find that the line profiles are almost always single\npeaked, while transfer functions tend to have tails extending to large time\ndelays. The outflow, despite being primarily equatorially directed, causes an\nappreciable blue-shifted excess on both the echo image and line profile when\nseen from lower inclinations ($i \\lesssim 45^\\circ$). This effect may be\nobservable in low ionization lines such as $\\rm{H}\\beta$.\n", "  We study various supersymmetric RG flows of $N=3$ Chern-Simons-Matter theory\nin three dimensions by using four-dimensional $N=3$ gauged supergravity coupled\nto eight vector multiplets with $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$ gauge group. The $AdS_4$\ncritical point preserving the full $SO(3)\\times SU(3)$ provides a gravity dual\nof $N=3$ superconformal field theory with flavor symmetry $SU(3)$. We study the\nscalar potential and identify a new supersymmetric $AdS_4$ critical point\npreserving the full $N=3$ supersymmetry and unbroken $SO(3)\\times U(1)$\nsymmetry. An analytic RG flow solution interpolating between $SO(3)\\times\nSU(3)$ and $SO(3)\\times U(1)$ critical points is explicitly given. We then\ninvestigate possible RG flows from these $AdS_4$ critical points to\nnon-conformal field theories in the IR. All of the singularities appearing in\nthe IR turn out to be physically acceptable. Furthermore, we look for\nsupersymmetric solutions of the form $AdS_2\\times \\Sigma_2$ with $\\Sigma_2$\nbeing a two-sphere or a two-dimensional hyperbolic space and find a number of\n$AdS_2$ geometries preserving four supercharges with $SO(2)\\times SO(2)\\times\nSO(2)$ and $SO(2)\\times SO(2)$ symmetries.\n", "  I describe early work on strongly correlated electron systems [SCES] from the\nperspective of a theoretical physicist who, while a participant in their\nreductionist top- down beginnings, is now part of the paradigm change to a\nbottom-up \"emergent\" approach with its focus on using phenomenology to find the\norganizing principles responsible for their emergent behavior disclosed by\nexperiment---and only then constructing microscopic models that incorporate\nthese. After considering the organizing principles responsible for the\nemergence of plasmons, quasiparticles, and conventional superconductivity in\nSCES, I consider their application to three of SCES's sister systems, the\nhelium liquids, nuclei, and the nuclear matter found in neutron stars. I note\nsome recent applications of the random phase approximation and examine briefly\nthe role that paradigm change is playing in two central problems in our field:\nunderstanding the emergence and subsequent behavior of heavy electrons in Kondo\nlattice materials; and finding the mechanism for the unconventional\nsuperconductivity found in heavy electron, organic, cuprate, and iron-based\nmaterials.\n", "  We show by numerical simulations that a purely stellar dynamical model\ncomposed of an exponential disc, a cuspy bulge, and an NFW halo with parameters\nrelevant to the Milky Way Galaxy is subject to bar formation. Taking into\naccount the finite disc thickness, the bar formation can be explained by the\nusual bar instability, in spite of the presence of an inner Lindblad resonance,\nthat is believed to damp any global modes. The effect of replacing the live\nhalo and bulge by a fixed external axisymmetric potential (rigid models) is\nstudied. It is shown that while the e-folding time of bar instability increases\nsignificantly (from 250 to 500 Myr), the bar pattern speed remains almost the\nsame. For the latter, our average value of 55 km/s/kpc agrees with the\nassumption that the Hercules stream in the solar neighbourhood is an imprint of\nthe bar--disc interaction at the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar. Vertical\naveraging of the radial force in the central disc region comparable to the\ncharacteristic scale length allows us to reproduce the bar pattern speed and\nthe growth rate of the rigid models, using normal mode analysis of linear\nperturbation theory in a razor thin disc. The strong increase of the e-folding\ntime with decreasing disc mass predicted by the mode analysis suggests that\nbars in galaxies similar to the Milky Way have formed only recently.\n", "  Radii of charge and neutron distributions are fundamental nuclear properties.\nThey depend on both nuclear interaction parameters related to the equation of\nstate of infinite nuclear matter and on quantal shell effects, which are\nstrongly impacted by the presence of nuclear surface. In this work, by studying\nthe dependence of charge and neutron radii, and neutron skin, on nuclear matter\nparameters, we assess different mechanisms that drive nuclear sizes. We apply\nnuclear density functional theory using a family of Skyrme functionals obtained\nby means of different optimization protocols targeting specific nuclear\nproperties. By performing the Monte-Carlo sampling of reasonable functionals\naround the optimal parametrization, we study correlations between nuclear\nmatter paramaters and observables characterizing charge and neutron\ndistributions. We demonstrate the existence of the strong converse relation\nbetween the nuclear charge radii and the saturation density of symmetric\nnuclear matter and also between the neutron skins and the slope of the symmetry\nenergy. For functionals optimized to experimental binding energies only, proton\nand neutron radii are weakly correlated due to canceling trends from different\nnuclear matter parameters. We show that by requiring that the nuclear\nfunctional reproduces the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear\nmatter practically fixes the charge (or proton) radii, and vice versa. The\nneutron skin uncertainty primarily depends on the slope of the symmetry energy.\nConsequently, imposing a constraint on both $\\rho_0$ and $L$ practically\ndetermines the nuclear size, modulo small variations due to shell effects.\n", "  The hypothesis that high energy cosmic neutrinos are power law distributed is\ncritically analyzed. We propose a model with two components that explains\nbetter the observations. The extragalactic component of the high energy\nneutrino flux has a canonical $E_\\nu^{-2}$ spectrum while the galactic\ncomponent has a $E_\\nu^{-2.7}$ spectrum; both of them are significant. This\nmodel has several implications, that can be tested by IceCube and ANTARES in\nthe next years. Moreover, the existence of a diffuse component close to the\nGalactic plane and that yields (20-30)\\% of IceCube's events, is interesting\nfor the future $\\mbox{km}^3$ neutrino telescopes located in the Northern\nHemisphere and for gamma ray telescopes aiming at measuring events till few 100\nTeV from the Southern sky.\n", "  Accretion disks around supermassive black holes have regions where the\nRosseland mean opacity can be much larger than the electron scattering opacity\nprimarily due to the large number of bound-bound transitions in iron. We study\nthe effects of this iron opacity \"bump\" on the thermal stability and vertical\nstructure of radiation pressure dominated accretion disks, utilizing three\ndimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations in the local shearing\nbox approximation. The simulations self-consistently calculate the heating due\nto MHD turbulence caused by magneto-rotational instability and radiative\ncooling by using the radiative transfer module based on a variable Eddington\ntensor in Athena. For a $5\\times 10^8$ solar mass black hole with $\\sim 3\\%$ of\nthe Eddington luminosity, a model including the iron opacity bump maintains its\nstructure for more than $10$ thermal times without showing significant signs of\nthermal runaway. In contrast, if only electron scattering and free-free opacity\nare included as in the standard thin disk model, the disk collapses on the\nthermal time scale. The difference is caused by a combination of 1) an\nanti-correlation between the total optical depth and the temperature, and 2)\nenhanced vertical advective energy transport. These results suggest that the\niron opacity bump may have a strong impact on the stability and structure of\nAGN accretion disks, and may contribute to a dependence of AGN properties on\nmetallicity. Since this opacity is relevant primarily in UV emitting regions of\nthe flow, it may help to explain discrepancies between observation and theory\nthat are unique to AGNs.\n", "  We discuss an extension of the Coyote emulator to predict non-linear matter\npower spectra of dark energy (DE) models with a scale factor dependent equation\nof state of the form w = w_0 + ( 1 - a )w_a . The extension is based on the\nmapping rule between non-linear spectra of DE models with constant equation of\nstate and those with time varying one originally introduced in ref. [40]. Using\na series of N-body simulations we show that the spectral equivalence is\naccurate to sub-percent level across the same range of modes and redshift\ncovered by the Coyote suite. Thus, the extended emulator provides a very\nefficient and accurate tool to predict non-linear power spectra for DE models\nwith w_0 - w_a parametrization. According to the same criteria we have\ndeveloped a numerical code, and we have implemented in a dedicated module for\nthe CAMB code, that can be used in combination with the Coyote Emulator in\nlikelihood analyses of non-linear matter power spectrum measurements. All codes\ncan be found at https://github.com/luciano-casarini/PKequal\n", "  Relativistic reconnection has been invoked as a mechanism for particle\nacceleration in numerous astrophysical systems. According to idealised\nanalytical models reconnection produces a bulk relativistic outflow emerging\nfrom the reconnection sites (X-points). The resulting radiation is therefore\nhighly beamed. Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet. Once they reach the islands they isotropise after\ncompleting a full Larmor gyration and their radiation is not strongly beamed\nanymore. The radiation pattern at a given frequency depends on where the\ncorresponding emitting electrons radiate their energy. Lower energy particles\nthat cool slowly spend most of their time in the islands, and their radiation\nis not highly beamed. Only particles that quickly cool at the edge of the\nX-points generate a highly beamed fan-like radiation pattern. The radiation\nemerging from these fast cooling particles is above the burn-off limit (about\n100 MeV in the overall rest frame of the reconnecting plasma.) This has\nsignificant implications for models of GRBs and AGNs that invoke beaming in\nthat frame at much lower energies.\n", "  In two recent papers exact Hermite-Gaussian solutions to relativistic wave\nequations have been obtained for both electromagnetic and particle beams that\ninclude Gouy phase. The solutions for particle beams correspond to those of the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. Here, distinct\ncanonical and kinetic 4-momentum operators will be defined for quantum\nparticles in matter wave beams. The kinetic momentum is equal to the canonical\nmomentum minus the fluctuating terms resulting from the transverse localization\nof the beam. Three results are obtained. First, the total energy of a particle\nfor each beam mode is calculated. Second, the localization terms couple into\nthe canonical 4-momentum of the beam particles as a Lorentz covariant quantum\n4-potential originating at the waist. The quantum 4-potential plays an\nanalogous role in relativistic Hamiltonian quantum mechanics to the Bohm\npotential in the non-relativistic quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Third, the\norbital angular momentum (OAM) operator must be defined in terms of canonical\nmomentum operators. It is further shown that kinetic 4-momentum does not\ncontribute to OAM indicating that OAM can therefore be regarded as a pure\nmanifestation of quantum 4-potential.\n", "  Exploiting the sensitivity and spatial resolution of the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have studied the morphology and the\nphysical scale of the interstellar medium - both gas and dust - in SGP38326, an\nunlensed pair of interacting starbursts at $z= 4.425$. SGP38326 is the most\nluminous star bursting system known at $z > 4$ with an IR-derived ${\\rm SFR\n\\sim 4300 \\,} M_\\odot \\, {\\rm yr}^{-1}$. SGP38326 also contains a molecular gas\nreservoir among the most massive ever found in the early Universe, and it is\nthe likely progenitor of a massive, red-and-dead elliptical galaxy at $z \\sim\n3$. Probing scales of $\\sim 0.1\"$ or $\\sim 800 \\, {\\rm pc}$ we find that the\nsmooth distribution of the continuum emission from cool dust grains contrasts\nwith the more irregular morphology of the gas, as traced by the [CII] fine\nstructure emission. The gas is also extended over larger physical scales than\nthe dust. The velocity information provided by the resolved [CII] emission\nreveals that the dynamics of the two components of SGP38326 are compatible with\ndisk-like, ordered rotation, but also reveals an ISM which is turbulent and\nunstable. Our observations support a scenario where at least a subset of the\nmost distant extreme starbursts are highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich\ngalaxies.\n", "  We obtain dispersion relations of magnetic field fluctuations for two\ncrossings of the terrestrial foreshock by Cluster spacecraft. These crossings\ncover plasma conditions which differ significantly in their plasma $\\beta$ but\nnot in the properties of the encountered ion population, both showing\nshell-like distribution function. Dispersion relations are reconstructed using\ntwo-point instantaneous wave number estimations from pairs of Cluster\nspacecraft. The accessible range of wave vectors, limited by the available\nspacecraft separations, extends to $\\approx \\!2 \\times 10^4$ km. Results show\nmultiple branches of dispersion relation, associated with different power of\nmagnetic field fluctuations. We find that Sunward propagating fast magnetosonic\nwaves and beam resonant modes are dominant for the high plasma $\\beta$\ninterval, while the dispersions of magnetically dominated interval include\nAlfv\\'{e}n and fast magnetosonic modes propagating Sunward and unit-Sunward.\n", "  Recent LHC data provides precise values of coupling constants of the Higgs\nfield, however, these measurements do not determine its coupling with gravity.\nWe explore this freedom to see whether Higgs field non-minimally coupled to\nGauss-Bonnet term in 4-dimensions can lead to inflation generating the observed\ndensity fluctuations. We obtain analytical solution for this model and that the\nexit of inflation (with a finite number of e-folding) demands that the energy\nscale of inflation is close to Electro-weak scale. We compare the scalar and\ntensor power spectrum of our model with PLANCK data and discuss its\nimplications.\n", "  We explore the breaking of Lorentz and CPT invariance in strong interactions\nat low energy in the framework of chiral perturbation theory. Starting from the\nset of Lorentz-violating operators of mass-dimension five with quark and gluon\nfields, we construct the effective chiral Lagrangian with hadronic and\nelectromagnetic interactions induced by these operators. We develop the\npower-counting scheme and discuss loop diagrams and the one-pion-exchange\nnucleon-nucleon potential. The effective chiral Lagrangian is the basis for\ncalculations of low-energy observables with hadronic degrees of freedom. As\nexamples, we consider clock-comparison experiments with nuclei and\nspin-precession experiments with nucleons in storage rings. We derive strict\nlimits on the dimension-five tensors that quantify Lorentz and CPT violation.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall insulator is characterized by the helical edge states, with\nthe spin polarization of electron being locked to its direction of motion.\nAlthough the edge-state conduction has been observed, unambiguous evidence of\nthe helical spin texture is still lacking. Here, we investigate the coherent\nedge-state transport in an interference loop pinched by two point contacts. Due\nto the helical character, the forward inter-edge scattering enforces a $\\pi$\nspin rotation. Two successive processes can only produce a nontrivial $2\\pi$ or\ntrivial $0$ spin rotation, which can be controlled by the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. The nontrivial spin rotation results in a geometric $\\pi$ Berry\nphase, which can be detected by a $\\pi$ phase shift of the conductance\noscillation relative to the trivial case. Our results provide a smoking gun\nevidence for the helical spin texture of the edge states. Moreover, it also\nprovides the opportunity to all-electrically explore the trajectory-dependent\nspin Berry phase in condensed matter.\n", "  We observe that conformal blocks of scalar 4-point functions in a\n$d$-dimensional conformal field theory can mapped to eigenfunctions of a\n2-particle hyperbolic Calogero-Sutherland Hamiltonian. The latter describes two\ncoupled P\\\"oschl-Teller particles. Their interaction, whose strength depends\nsmoothly on the dimension $d$, is known to be superintegrable. Our observation\nenables us to exploit the rich mathematical literature on Calogero-Sutherland\nmodels in deriving various results for conformal field theory. These include an\nexplicit construction of conformal blocks in terms of Heckman-Opdam\nhypergeometric functions and a remarkable duality that relates the blocks of\ntheories in different dimensions.\n", "  We analyse archival data from the Parkes radio telescope which was observing\na location 35.6$^\\circ$ away from SGR 1806-20 during its giant $\\gamma$-ray\nflare of 2004 December 27. We show that no FRB-like burst counterpart was\ndetected, and set a radio limit of 110\\,MJy at 1.4 GHz, including the estimated\n70\\,dB suppression of the signal due to its location in the far side lobe of\nParkes and the predicted scattering from the interstellar medium. The upper\nlimit for the magnetar giant flare radio to $\\gamma$-ray fluence ratio is\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{SGR} \\lesssim 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{Jy\\,ms\\,erg^{-1}\\,cm^{2}}$. Based\non the non-detection of a short and prompt $\\gamma$-ray counterpart of fifteen\nFRBs in $\\gamma$-ray transient monitors, we set a lower limit on the fluence\nratios of FRBs to be $\\eta_\\mathrm{FRB} \\gtrsim\n10^{7-9}\\,\\mathrm{Jy\\,ms\\,erg^{-1}\\,cm^{2}}$. The fluence ratio limit for \\sgr\\\nis inconsistent with all but one of the fifteen FRBs. We discuss possible\nvariations in the magnetar-FRB emission mechanism and observational caveats\nthat may reconcile the theory with observations.\n", "  Unraveling and controlling chemical dynamics requires techniques to image\nstructural changes of molecules with femtosecond temporal and picometer spatial\nresolution. Ultrashort-pulse x-ray free-electron lasers have significantly\nadvanced the field by enabling advanced pump-probe schemes. There is an\nincreasing interest in using table-top photon sources enabled by high-harmonic\ngeneration of ultrashort-pulse lasers for such studies. We present a novel\nhigh-harmonic source driven by a 100 kHz fiber laser system, which delivers\n10$^{11}$ photons/s in a single 1.3 eV bandwidth harmonic at 68.6 eV. The\ncombination of record-high photon flux and high repetition rate paves the way\nfor time-resolved studies of the dissociation dynamics of inner-shell ionized\nmolecules in a coincidence detection scheme. First coincidence measurements on\nCH$_3$I are shown and it is outlined how the anticipated advancement of fiber\nlaser technology and improved sample delivery will, in the next step, allow\npump-probe studies of ultrafast molecular dynamics with table-top XUV-photon\nsources. These table-top sources can provide significantly higher repetition\nrates than the currently operating free-electron lasers and they offer very\nhigh temporal resolution due to the intrinsically small timing jitter between\npump and probe pulses.\n", "  Resonance dielectric response of excitons is studied for the high-quality\nGaAs/InGaAs heterostructures with wide asymmetric quantum wells (QWs). To\nhighlight effects of the QW asymmetry, we have grown and studied several\nheterostructures with nominally square QWs as well as with triangle-like QWs.\nSeveral quantum confined exciton states are experimentally observed as narrow\nexciton resonances with various profiles. A standard approach for the\nphenomenological analysis of the profiles is generalized by introducing of\ndifferent phase shifts for the light waves reflected from the QWs at different\nexciton resonances. Perfect agreement of the phenomenological fit to the\nexperimentally observed exciton spectra for high-quality structures allowed us\nto obtain reliable parameters of the exciton resonances including the exciton\ntransition energies, the radiative broadenings, and the phase shifts. A direct\nnumerical solution of Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for the heavy-hole excitons in\nasymmetric QWs is used for microscopic modeling of the exciton resonances.\nRemarkable agreement with the experiment is achieved when the effect of indium\nsegregation during the heterostructure growth is taken into account. The\nsegregation results in a modification of the potential profile, in particular,\nin an asymmetry of the nominally square QWs.\n", "  The layered semiconductor SnSe is one of the highest-performing\nthermoelectric materials known. We demonstrate, through a first-principles\nlattice-dynamics study, that the high-temperature Cmcm phase is a dynamic\naverage over lower-symmetry minima separated by very small energetic barriers.\nCompared to the low-temperature Pnma phase, the Cmcm phase displays a phonon\nsoftening and enhanced three-phonon scattering, leading to an anharmonic\ndamping of the low-frequency modes and hence the thermal transport. We develop\na renormalisation scheme to quantify the effect of the soft modes on the\ncalculated properties, and confirm that the anharmonicity is an inherent\nfeature of the Cmcm phase. These results suggest a design concept for thermal\ninsulators and thermoelectric materials, based on displacive instabilities, and\nhighlight the power of lattice-dynamics calculations for materials\ncharacterization.\n", "  We analyze the imprint of nodal planes in high-order harmonic spectra from\naligned diatomic molecules in intense laser fields whose components exhibit\northogonal polarizations. We show that the typical suppression in the spectra\nassociated to nodal planes is distorted, and that this distortion can be\nemployed to map the electron's angle of return to its parent ion. This\ninvestigation is performed semi-analytically at the single-molecule response\nand single-active orbital level, using the strong-field approximation and the\nsteepest descent method. We show that the velocity form of the dipole operator\nis superior to the length form in providing information about this distortion.\nHowever, both forms introduce artifacts that are absent in the actual\nmomentum-space wavefunction. Furthermore, elliptically polarized fields lead to\nlarger distortions in comparison to two-color orthogonally polarized fields.\nThese features are investigated in detail for $\\mathrm{O}_2$, whose highest\noccupied molecular orbital provides two orthogonal nodal planes.\n", "  GRB 130427A was the brightest gamma-ray burst detected in the last 30 years.\nWith an equivalent isotropic energy output of $8.5\\times10^{53}$ erg and\nredshift $z=0.34$, it uniquely combined very high energetics with a relative\nproximity to Earth. As a consequence, its X-ray afterglow has been detected by\nsensitive X-ray observatories such as XMM-Newton and Chandra for a\nrecord-breaking baseline longer than 80 million seconds. We present the X-ray\nlight-curve of this event over such an interval. The light-curve shows a simple\npower-law decay with a slope $\\alpha = 1.309 \\pm 0.007$ over more than three\ndecades in time (47 ks - 83 Ms). We discuss the consequences of this result for\na few models proposed so far to interpret GRB 130427A, and more in general the\nsignificance of this outcome in the context of the standard forward shock\nmodel. We find that this model has difficulty in explaining our data, in both\ncases of constant density and stellar wind circumburst media, and requires\nfar-fetched values for the physical parameters involved.\n", "  We describe the extension of the density matrix embedding theory (DMET)\nframework to coupled interacting fermion-boson systems. This provides a\nfrequency-independent, entanglement embedding formalism to treat bulk\nfermion-boson problems. We illustrate the concepts within the context of the\none-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model, where the phonon bath states are\nobtained from the Schmidt decomposition of a self-consistently adjusted\ncoherent state. We benchmark our results against accurate density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations.\n", "  Experimentalists seeking to improve the coherent lifetimes of quantum bits\nhave generally focused on mitigating decoherence mechanisms through, for\nexample, improvements to qubit designs and materials, and system isolation from\nenvironmental perturbations. In the case of the phase degree of freedom in a\nquantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be preserved is not\nsolely internal to the qubit, but rather necessarily includes that of the qubit\nrelative to the \"master clock\" (e.g. a local oscillator) that governs its\ncontrol system. In this manuscript we articulate the impact of instabilities in\nthe master clock on qubit phase coherence, and provide tools to calculate the\ncontributions to qubit error arising from these processes. We first connect\nstandard oscillator phase-noise metrics to their corresponding qubit dephasing\nspectral densities. We then use representative lab-grade and performance-grade\noscillator specifications to calculate operational fidelity bounds on\ntrapped-ion and superconducting qubits with relatively slow and fast operation\ntimes. We discuss the relevance of these bounds for quantum error correction in\ncontemporary experiments and future large-scale quantum information systems,\nand discuss potential means to improve master clock stability.\n", "  We implement the statistically sound G-JF thermostat for Langevin Dynamics\nsimulations into the ESPREesSo molecular package for large-scale simulations of\nsoft matter systems. The implemented integration method is tested against the\nintegrator currently used by the molecular package in simulations of a fluid\nbilayer membrane. While the latter exhibits deviations in the sampling\nstatistics that increase with the integration time step dt, the former\nreproduces near-correct configurational statistics for all dt within the\nstability range of the simulations. We conclude that, with very modest\nrevisions to existing codes, one can significantly improve the performance of\nstatistical sampling using Langevin thermostats.\n", "  We investigate the formation and stability of icosahedral quasicrytalline\nstructures using a dynamic phase field crystal model. Nonlinear interactions\nbetween density waves at two length scales stabilize three-dimensional\nquasicrystals. We determine the phase diagram and parameter values required for\nthe quasicrystal to be the global minimum free energy state. We demonstrate\nthat traits that promote the formation of two-dimensional quasicrystals are\nextant in three dimensions, and highlight the characteristics required for 3D\nsoft matter quasicrystal formation.\n", "  The analysis of stellar populations has, by and large, been developed for two\nlimiting cases: spatially-resolved stellar populations in the color-magnitude\ndiagram, and integrated light observations of distant systems. In between these\ntwo extremes lies the semi-resolved regime, which encompasses a rich and\nrelatively unexplored realm of observational phenomena. Here we develop the\nconcept of pixel color magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) as a powerful technique for\nanalyzing stellar populations in the semi-resolved regime. pCMDs show the\ndistribution of imaging data in the plane of pixel luminosity vs. pixel color.\nA key feature of pCMDs is that they are sensitive to all stars, including both\nthe evolved giants and the unevolved main sequence stars. An important variable\nin this regime is the mean number of stars per pixel, $N_{\\rm pix}$. Simulated\npCMDs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the star formation history (SFH) and\nallow one to break degeneracies between age, metallicity and dust based on two\nfilter data for values of $N_{\\rm pix}$ up to at least $10^4$. We extract pCMDs\nfrom Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging of M31 and derive\nnon-parametric SFHs from $10^6$ yr to $10^{10}$ yr for both the crowded disk\nand bulge regions (where $N_{\\rm pix}\\approx30-10^3$). From analyzing a small\nregion of the disk we find a non-parametric SFH that is smooth and consistent\nwith an exponential decay timescale of 4 Gyr. The bulge SFH is also smooth and\nconsistent with a 2 Gyr decay timescale. pCMDs will likely play an important\nrole in maximizing the science returns from next generation ground and\nspace-based facilities.\n", "  Low-mass \"dwarf\" galaxies represent the most significant challenges to the\ncold dark matter (CDM) model of cosmological structure formation. Because these\nfaint galaxies are (best) observed within the Local Group (LG) of the Milky Way\n(MW) and Andromeda (M31), understanding their formation in such an environment\nis critical. We present first results from the Latte Project: the Milky Way on\nFIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments). This simulation models the formation\nof a MW-mass galaxy to z = 0 within LCDM cosmology, including dark matter, gas,\nand stars at unprecedented resolution: baryon particle mass of 7070 Msun with\ngas kernel/softening that adapts down to 1 pc (with a median of 25 - 60 pc at z\n= 0). Latte was simulated using the GIZMO code with a mesh-free method for\naccurate hydrodynamics and the FIRE-2 model for star formation and explicit\nfeedback within a multi-phase interstellar medium. For the first time, Latte\nself-consistently resolves the spatial scales corresponding to half-light radii\nof dwarf galaxies that form around a MW-mass host down to Mstar > 10^5 Msun.\nLatte's population of dwarf galaxies agrees with the LG across a broad range of\nproperties: (1) distributions of stellar masses and stellar velocity\ndispersions (dynamical masses), including their joint relation; (2) the\nmass-metallicity relation; and (3) a diverse range of star-formation histories,\nincluding their mass dependence. Thus, Latte produces a realistic population of\ndwarf galaxies at Mstar > 10^5 Msun that does not suffer from the \"missing\nsatellites\" or \"too big to fail\" problems of small-scale structure formation.\nWe conclude that baryonic physics can reconcile observed dwarf galaxies with\nstandard LCDM cosmology.\n", "  Realizing the potential of 21 cm tomography to statistically probe the\nintergalactic medium before and during the Epoch of Reionization requires large\ntelescopes and precise control of systematics. Next-generation telescopes are\nnow being designed and built to meet these challenges, drawing lessons from\nfirst-generation experiments that showed the benefits of densely packed, highly\nredundant arrays--in which the same mode on the sky is sampled by many antenna\npairs--for achieving high sensitivity, precise calibration, and robust\nforeground mitigation. In this work, we focus on the Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionization Array (HERA) as an interferometer with a dense, redundant core\ndesigned following these lessons to be optimized for 21 cm cosmology. We show\nhow modestly supplementing or modifying a compact design like HERA's can still\ndeliver high sensitivity while enhancing strategies for calibration and\nforeground mitigation. In particular, we compare the imaging capability of\nseveral array configurations, both instantaneously (to address instrumental and\nionospheric effects) and with rotation synthesis (for foreground removal). We\nalso examine the effects that configuration has on calibratability using\ninstantaneous redundancy. We find that improved imaging with sub-aperture\nsampling via \"off-grid\" antennas and increased angular resolution via far-flung\n\"outrigger\" antennas is possible with a redundantly calibratable array\nconfiguration.\n", "  We present semi-analytic models of the epoch of reionization focusing on the\ndifferences between continuous and bursty star formation (SF). Our model\nutilizes physically motivated analytic fits to 1D radiative transfer\nsimulations of HII regions around dark matter halos in a representative cosmic\nvolume. Constraining our simulations with observed and extrapolated UV\nluminosity functions of high redshift galaxies, we find that for a fixed halo\nmass, stellar populations forming in bursty models produce larger HII regions\nwhich leave behind long-lived relic HII regions which are able to maintain\npartial ionization in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a manner similar to an\nearly X-ray background. The overall effect is a significant increase in the\noptical depth of the IGM, $\\tau_e$, and a milder increase of the redshift of\nreionization. To produce $\\tau_e =0.066$ observed by Planck and complete\nreionization by redshift $z_{\\rm re}\\sim 6$, models with bursty SF require an\nescape fraction $f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 2\\%-10\\%$ that is 2-10 times lower than\n$f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 17\\%$ found assuming continuous SF and is consistent with\nupper limits on $f_{\\rm esc}$ from observations at $z=0$ and $z\\sim 1.3-6$. The\nionizing photon budget needed to reproduce the observed $\\tau_e$ and $z_{\\rm\nre}$ depends on the period and duty cycle of the bursts of SF and the\ntemperature of the neutral IGM. These results suggest that the tension between\nobserved and predicted ionizing photon budget for reionization can be\nalleviated if reionization is driven by short bursts of SF, perhaps relating to\nthe formation of Population~III stars and compact star clusters such as\nproto-globular clusters.\n", "  We investigate the transport and single particle relaxation times of silicene\nin the presence of neutral and charged impurities. The static charge\nconductivity is studied using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism when the\nspin-orbit interaction is taken into account. The screening is modeled within\nThomas-Fermi and random phase approximations. We show that the transport\nrelaxation time is always longer than the single particle one. Easy electrical\ncontrollability of both carrier density and band gap in this buckled\ntwo-dimensional structure makes it a suitable candidate for several electronic\nand optoelectronic applications. In particular, we observe that the dc charge\nconductivity could be easily controlled through an external electric field, a\nvery promising feature for applications as electrical switches and transistors.\nOur findings would be qualitatively valid for other buckled honeycomb lattices\nof the same family, such as germanine and stanine.\n", "  The ability to transport quantum information across some distance can\nfacilitate the design and operation of a quantum processor. One-dimensional\nspin chains provide a compact platform to realize scalable spin transport for a\nsolid-state quantum computer. Here, we model odd-sized donor chains in silicon\nunder a range of experimental non-idealities, including variability of donor\nposition within the chain. We show that the tolerance against donor placement\ninaccuracies is greatly improved by operating the spin chain in a mode where\nthe electrons are confined at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. We then estimate the\nrequired timescales and exchange couplings, and the level of noise that can be\ntolerated to achieve high fidelity transport. We also propose a protocol to\ncalibrate and initialize the chain, thereby providing a complete guideline for\nrealizing a functional donor chain and utilizing it for spin transport.\n", "  Finite temperature Euclidean two-point functions in quantum mechanics or\nquantum field theory are characterized by a discrete set of Fourier\ncoefficients $G_{k}$, $k\\in\\mathbb Z$, associated with the Matsubara\nfrequencies $\\nu_{k}=2\\pi k/\\beta$. We show that analyticity implies that the\ncoefficients $G_{k}$ must satisfy an infinite number of model-independent\nlinear equations that we write down explicitly. In particular, we construct\n\"Analytic Renormalization Group\" linear maps $\\mathsf A_{\\mu}$ which, for any\nchoice of cut-off $\\mu$, allow to express the low energy Fourier coefficients\nfor $|\\nu_{k}|<\\mu$ (with the possible exception of the zero mode $G_{0}$),\ntogether with the real-time correlators and spectral functions, in terms of the\nhigh energy Fourier coefficients for $|\\nu_{k}|\\geq\\mu$. Operating a simple\nnumerical algorithm, we show that the exact universal linear constraints on\n$G_{k}$ can be used to systematically improve any random approximate data set\nobtained, for example, from Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results are\nillustrated on several explicit examples.\n", "  We present a treatment of the next-to-leading-order radiative corrections to\nunpolarized Moller and Bhabha scattering without resorting to\nultra-relativistic approximations. We extend existing soft-photon radiative\ncorrections with new hard-photon bremsstrahlung calculations so that the effect\nof photon emission is taken into account for any photon energy. This\nformulation is intended for application in the OLYMPUS experiment and the\nupcoming DarkLight experiment, but is applicable to a broad range of\nexperiments at energies where QED is a sufficient description.\n", "  The initial discovery of LIGO on 14 September 2015 was the inspiral merger\nand ring-down of the black hole binary at a distance of about 500~Mpc or a\nredshift of about 0.1. The search for electromagnetic counterparts for the\ninspiral of binary black holes is impeded by coarse initial source\nlocalisations and a lack of a compelling model for the counterpart; therefore,\nrapid electromagnetic follow-up is required to understand the astrophysical\ncontext of these sources. Because astrophysical sources of gravitational\nradiation are likely to reside in galaxies, it would make sense to search first\nin regions where the LIGO-Virgo probability is large and where the density of\ngalaxies is large as well. Under the assumption that the probability of a\ngravitational-wave event from a given region of space is proportional to the\ndensity of galaxies within the probed volume, one can calculate an improved\nlocalisation of the position of the source simply by multiplying the LIGO-Virgo\nskymap by the density of galaxies in the range of redshifts. We propose using\nthe 2-MASS Photometric Redshift Galaxy Catalogue for this purpose and\ndemonstrate that using it can dramatically reduce the search region for\nelectromagnetic counterparts.\n", "  We review recent works on the modelling of Generalised Parton Distributions\nwithin the Dyson-Schwinger formalism. We highlight how covariant computations,\nusing the impulse approximation, allows one to fulfil most of the theoretical\nconstraints of the GPDs. Specific attention is brought to chiral properties and\nespecially the so-called soft pion theorem, and its link with the Axial-Vector\nWard-Takahashi identity. The limitation of the impulse approximation are also\nexplained. Beyond impulse approximation computations are reviewed in the\nforward case. Finally, we stress the advantages of the overlap of lightcone\nwave functions, and possible ways to construct covariant GPD models within this\nframework, in a two-body approximation.\n", "  We implement high-efficiency coherent excitation to a Rydberg state using\nstimulated Raman adiabatic passage in a cold atom electron and ion source. We\nachieve an efficiency of 60% averaged over the laser excitation volume with a\npeak efficiency of 82%, a 1.6 times improvement relative to incoherent\npulsed-laser excitation. Using pulsed electric field ionization of the Rydberg\natoms we create electron bunches with durations of 250 ps. High-efficiency\nexcitation will increase source brightness, crucial for ultrafast electron\ndiffraction experiments, and coherent excitation to high-lying Rydberg states\ncould allow for the reduction of internal bunch heating and the creation of a\nhigh-speed single ion source.\n", "  Fault-tolerant quantum operation is a key requirement for the development of\nquantum computing. This has been realized in various solid-state systems\nincluding isotopically purified silicon which provides a nuclear spin free\nenvironment for the qubits, but not in industry standard natural (unpurified)\nsilicon. Here we demonstrate an addressable fault-tolerant qubit using a\nnatural silicon double quantum dot with a micromagnet optimally designed for\nfast spin control. This optimized design allows us to achieve the optimum Rabi\noscillation quality factor Q = 140 at a Rabi frequency of 10 MHz in the\nfrequency range two orders of magnitude higher than that achieved in previous\nstudies. This leads to a qubit fidelity of 99.6 %, which is the highest\nreported for natural silicon qubits and comparable to that obtained in\nisotopically purified silicon quantum-dot-based qubits. This result can inspire\ncontributions from the industrial and quantum computing communities.\n", "  Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations can accurately predict the properties\nof the intergalactic medium (IGM), but only under the condition of retaining\nhigh spatial resolution necessary to resolve density fluctuations in the IGM.\nThis resolution constraint prohibits simulating large volumes, such as those\nprobed by BOSS and future surveys, like DESI and 4MOST. To overcome this\nlimitation, we present Iteratively Matched Statistics (IMS), a novel method to\naccurately model the Lyman-alpha forest with collisionless N-body simulations,\nwhere the relevant density fluctuations are unresolved. We use a small-box,\nhigh-resolution hydrodynamic simulation to obtain the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) and the power spectrum of the real-space Lyman-alpha forest\nflux. These two statistics are iteratively mapped onto a pseudo-flux field of\nan N-body simulation, which we construct from the matter density. We\ndemonstrate that our method can perfectly reproduce line-of-sight observables,\nsuch as the PDF and power spectrum, and accurately reproduce the 3D flux power\nspectrum (5-20%). We quantify the performance of the commonly used Gaussian\nsmoothing technique and show that it has significantly lower accuracy (20-80%),\nespecially for N-body simulations with achievable mean inter-particle\nseparations in large-volume simulations. In addition, we show that IMS produces\nreasonable and smooth spectra, making it a powerful tool for modeling the IGM\nin large cosmological volumes and for producing realistic \"mock\" skies for\nLyman-alpha forest surveys.\n", "  Magnetization manipulation in the absence of an external magnetic field is a\ntopic of great interest, since many novel physical phenomena need to be\nunderstood and promising new applications can be imagined. Cutting-edge\nexperiments have shown the capability to switch the magnetization of magnetic\nthin films using ultrashort polarized laser pulses. In 2007, it was first\nobserved that the magnetization switching for GdFeCo alloy thin films was\nhelicity-dependent and later helicity-independent switching was also\ndemonstrated on the same material. Recently, all-optical switching has also\nbeen discovered for a much larger variety of magnetic materials (ferrimagnetic,\nferromagnetic films and granular nanostructures), where the theoretical models\nexplaining the switching in GdFeCo films do not appear to apply, thus\nquestioning the uniqueness of the microscopic origin of all-optical switching.\nHere, we show that two different all-optical switching mechanisms can be\ndistinguished; a \"single pulse\" switching and a \"cumulative\" switching process\nwhose rich microscopic origin is discussed. We demonstrate that the latter is a\ntwo-step mechanism; a heat-driven demagnetization followed by a\nhelicity-dependent remagnetization. This is achieved by an all-electrical and\ntime-dependent investigation of the all-optical switching in ferrimagnetic and\nferromagnetic Hall crosses via the anomalous Hall effect, enabling to probe the\nall-optical switching on different timescales.\n", "  Black hole configurations offer insights on the non-linear aspects of\ngravitational theories, and can suggest testable predictions for modifications\nof General Relativity. In this work, we examine exact black hole configurations\nin vector-tensor theories, originally proposed to explain dark energy by\nbreaking the Abelian symmetry with a non-minimal coupling of the vector to\ngravity. We are able to evade the no-go theorems by Bekenstein on the existence\nof regular black holes in vector-tensor theories with Proca mass terms, and\nexhibit regular black hole solutions with a profile for the longitudinal vector\npolarization, characterised by an additional charge. We analytically find the\nmost general static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions with and\nwithout a cosmological constant, and study in some detail their features, such\nas how the geometry depends on the vector charges. We also include angular\nmomentum, and find solutions describing slowly-rotating black holes. Finally,\nwe extend some of these solutions to higher dimensions.\n", "  We analyze the energy and zenith angle distributions of the latest 2-year\nIceCube dataset of upward going atmospheric neutrinos to constrain sterile\nneutrinos at the eV scale in the 3+1 scenario. We find that the parameters\nfavored by a combination of LSND and MiniBooNE data are excluded at more than\nthe 99% C.L. We explore the impact of nonstandard matter interactions on this\nexclusion, and find that the exclusion holds for nonstandard interactions (NSI)\nthat are within the stringent model-dependent bounds set by collider and\nneutrino scattering experiments. However, for large NSI parameters subject only\nto model-independent bounds from neutrino oscillation experiments, the LSND and\nMiniBooNE data are consistent with IceCube.\n", "  Large scale vortices could play a key role in the evolution of protoplanetary\ndisks, particularly in the dead-zone where no turbulence associated with\nmagnetic field is expected. Their possible formation by the subcritical\nbaroclinic instability is a complex issue due to the vertical structure of the\ndisk and to the elliptical instability.} {In two-dimensional disks the\nbaroclinic instability is studied as a function of the thermal transfer\nefficiency. In three-dimensional disks we explore the importance of radial and\nvertical stratification on the processes of vortex formation and\namplification.} {Numerical simulations are performed using a fully compressible\nhydrodynamical code based on a second order finite volume method. We assume a\nperfect gas law in inviscid disk models in which heat transfer is due to either\nrelaxation or diffusion.} {In 2D, the baroclinic instability with thermal\nrelaxation leads to the formation of large-scale vortices, which are unstable\nwith respect to the elliptic instability. In the presence of heat diffusion,\nhollow vortices are formed which evolve into vortical structures with a\nturbulent core. In 3D, the disk stratification is found to be unstable in a\nfinite layer which can include the mid-plane or not. When the unstable layer\ncontains the mid-plane, the 3D baroclinic instability with thermal relaxation\nis found to develop first in the unstable layer as in 2D, producing large-scale\nvortices. These vortices are then stretched out in the stable layer, creating\nlong-lived columnar vortical structures extending through the height of the\ndisk. They are also found to be the source of internal vortex layers that\ndevelop across the whole disk along baroclinic critical layer surfaces, and\nform new vortices in the upper region of the disk.} {In three-dimensional\ndisks, vortices can survive for a very long time if the production of vorticity\nby...\n", "  The chirally rotated Schr\\\"odinger functional ($\\chi$SF) with massless\nWilson-type fermions provides an alternative lattice regularization of the\nSchr\\\"odinger functional (SF), with different lattice symmetries and a common\ncontinuum limit expected from universality. The explicit breaking of flavour\nand parity symmetries needs to be repaired by tuning the bare fermion mass and\nthe coefficient of a dimension 3 boundary counterterm. Once this is achieved\none expects the mechanism of automatic O($a$) improvement to be operational in\nthe $\\chi$SF, in contrast to the standard formulation of the SF. This is\nexpected to significantly improve the attainable precision for step-scaling\nfunctions of some composite operators. Furthermore, the $\\chi$SF offers new\nstrategies to determine finite renormalization constants which are\ntraditionally obtained from chiral Ward identities. In this paper we consider a\ncomplete set of fermion bilinear operators, define corresponding correlation\nfunctions and explain the relation to their standard SF counterparts. We\ndiscuss renormalization and O($a$) improvement and then use this set-up to\nformulate the theoretical expectations which follow from universality.\nExpanding the correlation functions to one-loop order of perturbation theory we\nthen perform a number of non-trivial checks. In the process we obtain the\naction counterterm coefficients to one-loop order and reproduce some known\nperturbative results for renormalization constants of fermion bilinears. By\nconfirming the theoretical expectations, this perturbative study lends further\nsupport to the soundness of the $\\chi$SF framework and prepares the ground for\nnon-perturbative applications.\n", "  The scalar sector of the minimal Left-Right model at TeV scale is revisited\nin light of the large quartic coupling needed for a heavy flavor-changing\nscalar. The stability and perturbativity of the effective potential is\ndiscussed and merged with constraints from low-energy processes. Thus the\nperturbative level of the Left-Right scale is sharpened. Lower limits on the\ntriplet scalars are also derived: the left-handed triplet is bounded by oblique\nparameters, while the doubly-charged right-handed component is limited by the\n$h \\to \\gamma \\gamma, Z \\gamma$ decays. Current constraints disfavor their\ndetection as long as $W_R$ is within the reach of the LHC.\n", "  We present in detail the Einstein equations in the\nBaumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation for the case of $D$ dimensional\nspacetimes with $SO(D-d)$ isometry based on a method originally introduced in\nRef.1. Regularized expressions are given for a numerical implementation of this\nmethod on a vertex centered grid including the origin of the quasi-radial\ncoordinate that covers the extra dimensions with rotational symmetry.\nAxisymmetry, corresponding to the value $d=D-2$, represents a special case with\nfewer constraints on the vanishing of tensor components and is conveniently\nimplemented in a variation of the general method. The robustness of the scheme\nis demonstrated for the case of a black-hole head-on collision in $D=7$\nspacetime dimensions with $SO(4)$ symmetry.\n", "  Hyperkagome iridate, Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$, has been regarded as a promising\ncandidate material for a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid. Here the\nthree-dimensional network of corner-sharing triangles forms the hyperkagome\nlattice of Ir$^{4+}$ ions. Due to strong spin-orbit coupling, the local moments\nof Ir$^{4+}$ ions are described by the pseudospin $j_{\\rm eff} = 1/2$ Kramers\ndoublet. The Heisenberg model on this lattice is highly frustrated and\nquantum/classical versions have been studied in earlier literature. In this\nwork, we derive a generic local-moment model beyond the Heisenberg limit for\nthe hyperkagome iridate by considering multi-orbital interactions for all the\n$t_{2g}$ orbitals and spin-orbit coupling. The lifting of massive classical\ndegeneracy in the Heisenberg model by various spin-anisotropy terms is\ninvestigated at the classical level and the resulting phase diagram is\npresented. We find that different anisotropy terms prefer distinct classes of\nmagnetically ordered phases, often with various discrete degeneracy. The\nimplications of our results for recent $\\mu$SR and NMR experiments on this\nmaterial and possible quantum spin liquid phases are discussed.\n", "  The abundance of clusters and the clustering of galaxies are two of the\nimportant cosmological probes for current and future large scale surveys of\ngalaxies, such as the Dark Energy Survey. In order to combine them one has to\naccount for the fact that they are not independent quantities, since they probe\nthe same density field. It is important to develop a good understanding of\ntheir correlation in order to extract parameter constraints. We present a\ndetailed modelling of the joint covariance matrix between cluster number counts\nand the galaxy angular power spectrum. We employ the framework of the halo\nmodel complemented by a Halo Occupation Distribution model (HOD). We\ndemonstrate the importance of accounting for non-Gaussianity to produce\naccurate covariance predictions. Indeed, we show that the non-Gaussian\ncovariance becomes dominant at small scales, low redshifts or high cluster\nmasses. We discuss in particular the case of the super-sample covariance (SSC),\nincluding the effects of galaxy shot-noise, halo second order bias and\nnon-local bias. We demonstrate that the SSC obeys mathematical inequalities and\npositivity. Using the joint covariance matrix and a Fisher matrix methodology,\nwe examine the prospects of combining these two probes to constrain\ncosmological and HOD parameters. We find that the combination indeed results in\nnoticeably better constraints, with improvements of order 20\\% on cosmological\nparameters compared to the best single probe, and even greater improvement on\nHOD parameters, with reduction of error bars by a factor 1.4-4.8. This happens\nin particular because the cross-covariance introduces a synergy between the\nprobes on small scales. We conclude that accounting for non-Gaussian effects is\nrequired for the joint analysis of these observables in galaxy surveys.\n", "  Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we solve the time-dependent Schroedinger\nequation that is reduced to a classical nonlinear integrable equation. For a\ngiven time-dependent Hamiltonian, the counterdiabatic term is introduced to\nprevent nonadiabatic transitions. Using the fact that the equation for the\ndynamical invariant is equivalent to the Lax equation in nonlinear integrable\nsystems, we obtain the counterdiabatic term exactly. The counterdiabatic term\nis available when the corresponding Lax pair exists and the solvable systems\nare classified in a unified and systematic way. Multisoliton potentials\nobtained from the Korteweg-de Vries equation and isotropic XY spin chains from\nthe Toda equations are studied in detail.\n", "  We present measurements of the [NII]/Ha ratio as a probe of gas-phase oxygen\nabundance for a sample of 419 star-forming galaxies at z=0.6-2.7 from the\nKMOS3D near-IR multi-IFU survey. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) is\ndetermined consistently with the same sample selection, metallicity tracer, and\nmethodology over the wide redshift range probed by the survey. We find good\nagreement with long-slit surveys in the literature, except for the low-mass\nslope of the relation at z~2.3, where this sample is less biased than previous\nsamples based on optical spectroscopic redshifts. In this regime we measure a\nsteeper slope than some literature results. Excluding the AGN contribution from\nthe MZR reduces sensitivity at the high mass end, but produces otherwise\nconsistent results. There is no significant dependence of the [NII]/Ha ratio on\nSFR or environment at fixed redshift and stellar mass. The IFU data allow\nspatially resolved measurements of [NII]/Ha, from which we can infer abundance\ngradients for 180 galaxies, thus tripling the current sample in the literature.\nThe observed gradients are on average flat, with only 15 gradients\nstatistically offset from zero at >3sigma. We have modelled the effect of\nbeam-smearing, assuming a smooth intrinsic radial gradient and known seeing,\ninclination and effective radius for each galaxy. Our seeing-limited\nobservations can recover up to 70% of the intrinsic gradient for the largest,\nface-on disks, but only 30% for the smaller, more inclined galaxies. We do not\nfind significant trends between observed or corrected gradients and any stellar\npopulation, dynamical or structural galaxy parameters, mostly in agreement with\nexisting studies with much smaller sample sizes. In cosmological simulations,\nstrong feedback is generally required to produce flat gradients at high\nredshift.\n", "  Thermal stability of the Topological Color Code in presence of a thermal bath\nis studied. We study the Lindblad evolution of the observables in the weak\ncoupling limit of the Born-Markov approximation. The auto-correlation functions\nof the observables are used as a figure of merit for the thermal stability. We\nshow that all of the observables auto-correlation functions decay exponentially\nin time. By finding a lower bound of the decay rate, which is a constant\nindependent of the system size, we show that the Topological Color Code is\nunstable against thermal fluctuations from the bath at finite temperature, even\nthough it is stable at T=0 against local quantum perturbations.\n", "  In this paper we study the effect of non-trivial spatial topology on quantum\nentanglement by examining the degenerate ground states of a topologically\nordered system on torus. Using the string-net (fixed-point) wave-function, we\npropose a general formula of the reduced density matrix when the system is\npartitioned into two cylinders. The cylindrical topology of the subsystems\nmakes a significant difference in regard to entanglement: a global quantum\nnumber for the many-body states comes into play, together with a decomposition\nmatrix $M$ which describes how topological charges of the ground states\ndecompose into boundary degrees of freedom. We obtain a general formula for\nentanglement entropy and generalize the concept of minimally entangled states\nto minimally entangled sectors. Concrete examples are demonstrated with data\nfrom both finite groups and modular tensor categories (i.e., Fibonacci, Ising,\netc.), supported by numerical verification.\n", "  Gamma-ray burst light curves are characterized by marked variability, each\nshowing unique properties. The origin of such variability, at least for a\nfraction of long GRBs, may be the result of an unsteady central engine. It is\nthus important to study the effects that an episodic central engine has on the\njet propagation and, eventually, on the prompt emission within the collapsar\nscenario. Thus, in this study we follow the interaction of pulsed outflows with\ntheir progenitor stars with hydrodynamic numerical simulations in both two and\nthree dimensions. We show that the propagation of unsteady jets is affected by\nthe interaction with the progenitor material well after the break-out time,\nespecially for jets with long quiescent times, comparable to or larger than a\nsecond. We also show that this interaction can lead to an asymmetric behavior\nin which pulse durations and quiescent periods are systematically different.\nAfter the pulsed jets drill through the progenitor and the interstellar medium,\nwe find that, on average, the quiescent epochs last longer than the pulses\n(even in simulations with symmetrical active and quiescent engine times). This\ncould explain the asymmetry detected in the light curves of long-quiescent\ntimes duration gamma-ray bursts.\n", "  We discuss possible association of fast radio bursts (FRBs) with supergiant\npulses emitted by young pulsars (ages $\\sim$ tens to hundreds of years) born\nwith regular magnetic field but very short -- few milliseconds -- spin periods.\nFRBs are extra-Galactic events coming from distances $d \\lesssim 100$ Mpc. Most\nof the dispersion measure (DM) comes from the material in the freshly ejected\nSNR shell; for a given burst the DM should decrease with time. FRBs are not\nexpected to be seen below $\\sim 300 $ MHz due to free-free absorption in the\nexpanding ejecta. A supernova might have been detected years before the burst;\nFRBs are mostly associated with star forming galaxies.\n  The model requires that some pulsars are born with very fast spins, of the\norder of few milliseconds. The observed distribution of spin-down powers\n$\\dot{E}$ in young energetic pulsars is consistent with equal birth rate per\ndecade of $\\dot{E}$. Accepting this injection spectrum and scaling the\nintrinsic brightness of FRBs with $\\dot{E}$, we predict the following\nproperties of a large sample of FRBs: (i) the brightest observed events come\nfrom a broad distribution in distances; (ii) for repeating bursts brightness\neither remains nearly constant (if the spin-down time is longer than the age of\nthe pulsar) or decreases with time otherwise; in the latter case DM $\\propto\n\\dot{E}$.\n", "  We predict a novel quantum interference based on the negative refraction\nacross a semiconductor P-N junction: with a local pump on one side of the\njunction, the response of a local probe on the other side behaves as if the\ndisturbance emanates not from the pump but instead from its mirror image about\nthe junction. This phenomenon is guaranteed by translational invariance of the\nsystem and matching of Fermi surfaces of the constituent materials, thus it is\nrobust against other details of the junction (e.g., junction width, potential\nprofile, and even disorder). The recently fabricated P-N junctions in 2D\nsemiconductors provide ideal platforms to explore this phenomenon and its\napplications to dramatically enhance charge and spin transport as well as\ncarrier-mediated long-range correlation.\n", "  An interesting possibility for dark matter is a scalar particle of mass of\norder 10 MeV-1 GeV, interacting with a U(1) gauge boson (dark photon) which\nmixes with the photon. We present a simple and natural model realizing this\npossibility. The dark matter arises as a composite pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson\n(dark pion) in a non-Abelian gauge sector, which also gives a mass to the dark\nphoton. For a fixed non-Abelian gauge group, SU(N), and a U(1) charge of the\nconstituent dark quarks, the model has only three free parameters: the\ndynamical scale of the non-Abelian gauge theory, the gauge coupling of the dark\nphoton, and the mixing parameter between the dark and standard model photons.\nIn particular, the gauge symmetry of the model does not allow any mass term for\nthe dark quarks, and stability of the dark pion is understood as a result of an\naccidental global symmetry. The model has a significant parameter space in\nwhich thermal relic dark pions comprise all of the dark matter, consistently\nwith all experimental and cosmological constraints. In a corner of the\nparameter space, the discrepancy of the muon g-2 between experiments and the\nstandard model prediction can also be ameliorated due to a loop contribution of\nthe dark photon. Smoking-gun signatures of the model include a monophoton\nsignal from the e+ e- collision into a photon and a \"dark rho meson.\"\nObservation of two processes in e+ e- collision, the mode into the dark photon\nand that into the dark rho meson, would provide strong evidence for the model.\n", "  Recently a new no-global-recollapse argument was given for some inhomogeneous\nand anisotropic cosmologies that utilizes surface deformation by the mean\ncurvature flow. In this paper we discuss important properties of the mean\ncurvature flow of spacelike surfaces in Lorentzian manifolds. We show that\nsingularities may form during cosmic evolution and the theorems forbidding the\nglobal recollapse lose their validity. The time evolution of the spatial scalar\ncurvature that may kinematically prevent the recollapse is determined in normal\ncoordinates, which shows the impact of inhomogeneities explicitly. Our analysis\nindicates a caveat in numerical solutions that give rise to inflation.\n", "  It is shown that each one of the Lie algebras su(1,1) and su(2) determine the\nspectrum of the radial oscillator. States that share the same orbital angular\nmomentum are used to construct the representation spaces of the non-compact Lie\ngroup SU(1,1). In addition, three different forms of obtaining the\nrepresentation spaces of the compact Lie group SU(2) are introduced, they are\nbased on the accidental degeneracies associated with the spherical symmetry of\nthe system as well as on the selection rules that govern the transitions\nbetween different energy levels. In all cases the corresponding generalized\ncoherent states are constructed and the conditions to squeeze the involved\nquadratures are analyzed.\n", "  We demonstrate the violation of an EPR steering inequality developed for\nsingle photon path entanglement with displacement-based detection. We use a\nhigh-rate source of heralded single-photon path-entangled states, combined with\nhigh-efficiency superconducting-based detectors, in a scheme that is free of\nany post-selection and thus immune to the detection loophole. This result\nconclusively demonstrates single-photon entanglement in a one-sided\ndevice-independent scenario, and opens the way towards implementations of\ndevice-independent quantum technologies within the paradigm of path\nentanglement.\n", "  We review some properties of black hole structures appearing in gravity with\na massless scalar field, with both minimal and nonminimal coupling. The main\nproperties of the resulting cold black holes are described. The study of black\nholes in scalar-gravity systems is extended to $k$-essence theories, and some\nexamples are explicitly worked out. In these cases, even while the existence of\nhorizons is possible, the metric regularity requirement on the horizon implies\neither a cold black type structure or a singular behavior of the scalar field.\n", "  We investigate superconductivity in a two-band system with an electron- and\nhole-like band, where one of the bands is away from the Fermi level (or\nincipient). We argue that the incipient band contributes significantly to\nspin-fluctuation pairing in the strong coupling limit where the system is close\nto a magnetic instability, and can lead to a large Tc. In this case, Tc is\nlimited by a competition between the frequency range of the coupling (set by an\nisolated paramagnon) and the coupling strength itself, such that a dome-like Tc\ndependence on the incipient band position is obtained. The coupling of\nelectrons to phonons is found to further enhance Tc. The results are discussed\nin the context of experiments on monolayers and intercalates of FeSe.\n", "  We have used the vortex filament method to numerically investigate the\ninteractions between pairs of quantized vortex rings that are initially\ntraveling in the same direction but with their axes offset by a variable impact\nparameter. The interaction of two circular rings of comparable radii produce\noutcomes that can be categorized into four regimes, dependent only on the\nimpact parameter; the two rings can either miss each other on the inside or\noutside, or they can reconnect leading to final states consisting of either one\nor two deformed rings. The fraction of of energy went into ring deformations\nand the transverse component of velocity of the rings are analyzed for each\nregime. We find that rings of very similar radius only reconnect for a very\nnarrow range of the impact parameter, much smaller than would be expected from\ngeometrical cross-section alone. In contrast, when the radii of the rings are\nvery different, the range of impact parameters producing a reconnection is\nclose to the geometrical value. A second type of interaction considered is the\ncollision of circular rings with a highly deformed ring. This type of\ninteraction appears to be a productive mechanism for creating small vortex\nrings. The simulations are discussed in the context of experiments on colliding\nvortex rings and quantum turbulence in superfluid helium in the zero\ntemperature limit.\n", "  Based on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the Type II-Plateau SN 2013eq,\nwe present a comparative study of commonly used distance determination methods\nbased on Type II supernovae. The occurrence of SN 2013eq in the Hubble flow (z\n= 0.041 +/- 0.001) prompted us to investigate the implications of the\ndifference between \"angular\" and \"luminosity\" distances within the framework of\nthe expanding photosphere method (EPM) that relies upon a relation between flux\nand angular size to yield a distance. Following a re-derivation of the basic\nequations of the EPM for SNe at non-negligible redshifts, we conclude that the\nEPM results in an angular distance. The observed flux should be converted into\nthe SN rest frame and the angular size, theta, has to be corrected by a factor\nof (1+z)^2. Alternatively, the EPM angular distance can be converted to a\nluminosity distance by implementing a modification of the angular size. For SN\n2013eq, we find EPM luminosity distances of D_L = 151 +/- 18 Mpc and D_L = 164\n+/- 20 Mpc by making use of different sets of dilution factors taken from the\nliterature. Application of the standardized candle method for Type II-P SNe\nresults in an independent luminosity distance estimate (D_L = 168 +/- 16 Mpc)\nthat is consistent with the EPM estimate.\n", "  We report on four radio-detected cosmic-ray (CR) or CR-like events observed\nwith the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA), a NASA-sponsored\nlong-duration balloon payload. Two of the four were previously identified as\nstratospheric CR air showers during the ANITA-I flight. A third stratospheric\nCR was detected during the ANITA-II flight. Here we report on characteristics\nthese three unusual CR events, which develop nearly horizontally, 20-30~km\nabove the surface of the Earth. In addition, we report on a fourth steeply\nupward-pointing ANITA-I CR-like radio event which has characteristics\nconsistent with a primary that emerged from the surface of the ice. This\nsuggests a possible $\\tau$-lepton decay as the origin of this event, but such\nan interpretation would require significant suppression of the Standard Model\n${\\tau}$-neutrino cross section.\n", "  It is established that physical observables in local quantum field theories\nshould be invariant under invertible field redefinitions. It is then expected\nthat this statement should be true for the entanglement entropy and moreover\nthat, via the gauge/gravity correspondence, the recipe for computing\nentanglement entropy holographically should also be invariant under local field\nredefinitions in the gravity side. We use this fact to fix the recipe for\ncomputing holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) for $f(R,R_{\\mu\\nu})$ theories\nwhich could be mapped to Einstein gravity. An outcome of our prescription is\nthat the surfaces that minimize the corresponding HEE functional for\n$f(R,R_{\\mu\\nu})$ theories always have vanishing trace of extrinsic curvature\nand that the HEE may be evaluated using the Wald entropy functional. We show\nthat similar results follow from the FPS and Dong HEE functionals, for Einstein\nmanifold backgrounds in $f(R,R_{\\mu\\nu})$ theories.\n", "  Local Lorentz Invariance violating (LLIV) and Einstein equivalence principle\nviolating (EEPV) effects in atomic experiments are discussed. The EEPV effects\nare strongly enhanced in the narrow 7.8 eV transition in 229Th nucleus. Nuclear\nLLIV momentum tensors describing anisotropy in the maximal attainable speed for\nmassive particles (analog of Michelson-Morley experiment for light) are\nexpressed in terms of the experimental values of nuclear quadrupole moments.\nCalculations for nuclei of experimental interest 133Cs, 85Rb, 87Rb, 201Hg,\n131Xe and 21Ne have been performed. The results for 21Ne are used to improve\nthe limits on the proton LLIV constants by 4 orders of magnitude.\n", "  We present a study of the optical properties of the 26 most massive galaxy\nclusters selected within the SPT-SZ 2500 deg$^2$ survey. This\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect selected sample spans a redshift range of 0.10 < z <\n1.13. We measure the galaxy radial profile, the luminosity function (LF), and\nthe halo occupation number (HON) using optical data with a typical depth of\n$m^*$ + 2. The stacked radial profiles are consistent with a NFW profile with a\nconcentration of $2.84^{+0.40}_{-0.37}$ for the red sequence (RS) and\n$2.36^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the total population. Stacking the data in multiple\nredshift bins shows a hint of redshift evolution in the concentration when both\nthe total population is used, and when only RS galaxies are used (at\n2.1$\\sigma$ and 2.8$\\sigma$, respectively). The stacked LF shows a faint end\nslope $\\alpha = -1.06^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ for the total and $\\alpha =\n-0.80^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ for the RS population. The redshift evolution of $m^*$\nis found to be consistent with a passively evolving Composite Stellar\nPopulation (CSP) model. By adopting the CSP model predictions, we explore the\nredshift evolution of the schechter parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\phi^*$. We find\n$\\alpha$ for the total population to be consistent with no evolution\n(0.3$\\sigma$), while evidence of evolution for the red galaxies is mildly\nsignificant (1.1-2.1$\\sigma$). The data show that the density $\\phi^*$/E$^2$(z)\ndecreases with redshift, in tension with the self-similar expectation at a\n2.4$\\sigma$ level for the total population. The measured HON-mass relation has\na lower normalization than previous studies at low redshift. Finally, our data\nsupport HON redshift evolution at a 2.1$\\sigma$ level, with clusters at higher\nredshift containing fewer galaxies per unit mass to $m^*$ + 3 than their low-z\ncounterparts [abridged].\n", "  Given that low-mass stars have intrinsically low luminosities at optical\nwavelengths and a propensity for stellar activity, it is advantageous for\nradial velocity (RV) surveys of these objects to use near-infrared (NIR)\nwavelengths. In this work we describe and test a novel RV extraction pipeline\ndedicated to retrieving RVs from low mass stars using NIR spectra taken by the\nCSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, where a methane\nisotopologue gas cell is used for wavelength calibration. The pipeline\nminimizes the residuals between the observations and a spectral model composed\nof templates for the target star, the gas cell, and atmospheric telluric\nabsorption; models of the line spread function, continuum curvature, and\nsinusoidal fringing; and a parameterization of the wavelength solution. The\nstellar template is derived iteratively from the science observations\nthemselves without a need for separate observations dedicated to retrieving it.\nDespite limitations from CSHELL's narrow wavelength range and instrumental\nsystematics, we are able to (1) obtain an RV precision of 35 m/s for the RV\nstandard star GJ 15 A over a time baseline of 817 days, reaching the photon\nnoise limit for our attained SNR, (2) achieve ~3 m/s RV precision for the M\ngiant SV Peg over a baseline of several days and confirm its long-term RV trend\ndue to stellar pulsations, as well as obtain nightly noise floors of ~2 - 6\nm/s, and (3) show that our data are consistent with the known masses, periods,\nand orbital eccentricities of the two most massive planets orbiting GJ 876.\nFuture applications of our pipeline to RV surveys using the next generation of\nNIR spectrographs, such as iSHELL, will enable the potential detection of\nSuper-Earths and Mini-Neptunes in the habitable zones of M dwarfs.\n", "  We review recent progress in the application of numerical relativity\ntechniques to astrophysics and high-energy physics. We focus on some\ndevelopments that took place within the \"Numerical Relativity and High Energy\nPhysics\" network, a Marie Curie IRSES action that we coordinated, namely: spin\nevolution in black hole binaries, high-energy black hole collisions, compact\nobject solutions in scalar-tensor gravity, superradiant instabilities and hairy\nblack hole solutions in Einstein's gravity coupled to fundamental fields, and\nthe possibility to gain insight into these phenomena using analog gravity\nmodels.\n", "  It has been generally accepted that unfilled skutterudites process high\nlattice thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_{l}$) that can be efficiently reduced\nupon filling. Here by using first principles Boltzmann-Peierls transport\ncalculations, we find pure skutterudite of FeSb$_3$ with no filler in fact has\nan intrinsic ultralow $\\kappa_{l}$ smaller than that of CoSb$_3$ by one order\nof magnitude. The value is even smaller than those of most of the fully filled\nskutterudites. This finding means that with FeSb$_3$ as a reference, filling\ndoes not necessarily lower $\\kappa_{l}$. The ultralow $\\kappa_{l}$ of FeSb$_3$\nis a consequence of much softened optical phonon branches associated with the\nweakly bonded Sb$_4$ rings. They overlap more with heat-carrying acoustic\nphonons and significantly increase the phase space for three-phonon anharmonic\nscattering processes. This provides an alternative non-filling related\nmechanism for lowering the $\\kappa_{l}$ of skutterudites.\n", "  We have analyzed data from Campaigns 0-5 of the K2 mission and report 19\nultra-short-period candidate planets with orbital periods of less than 1 day\n(nine of which have not been previously reported). Planet candidates range in\nsize from 0.7-16 Earth radii and in orbital period from 4.2 to 23.5 hours. One\ncandidate (EPIC 203533312, Kp=12.5) is among the shortest-period planet\ncandidates discovered to date (P=4.2 hours), and, if confirmed as a planet,\nmust have a density of at least rho=8.9 g/cm^3 in order to not be tidally\ndisrupted. Five candidates have nominal radius values in the sub-Jovian desert\n(R_P=3-11 R_E and P<=1.5 days) where theoretical models do not favor their\nlong-term stability; the only confirmed planet in this range is in fact thought\nto be disintegrating (EPIC 201637175). In addition to the planet candidates, we\nreport on four objects which may not be planetary, including one with\nintermittent transits (EPIC 211152484) and three initially promising candidates\nthat are likely false positives based on characteristics of their light curves\nand on radial velocity follow-up. A list of 91 suspected eclipsing binaries\nidentified at various stages in our vetting process is also provided. Based on\nan assessment of our survey's completeness, we estimate an occurrence rate for\nultra-short period planets among K2 target stars that is about half that\nestimated from the Kepler sample, raising questions as to whether K2 systems\nare intrinsically different from Kepler systems, possibly as a result of their\ndifferent galactic location.\n", "  We apply a friends-of-friends algorithm to an enhanced SDSS DR12\nspectroscopic catalog including redshift from literature to construct a catalog\nof $1588~N\\ge3$ compact groups of galaxies containing 5179 member galaxies and\ncovering the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.19$. This catalog contains 18 times\nas many systems and reaches 3 times the depth of similar catalog of Barton et\nal. (1996). We construct catalogs from both magnitude-limited and\nvolume-limited galaxy samples. Like Barton et al. (1996) we omit the frequently\napplied isolation criterion in the compact group selection algorithm. Thus the\ngroups selected by fixed projected spatial and rest frame line-of-sight\nvelocity separation produce a catalog of groups with a redshift independent\nmedian size. In contrast with previous catalogs, the enhanced SDSS DR12 catalog\n(including galaxies with $r < 14.5$) includes many systems with $z\\leq 0.05$.\nThe volume-limited samples are unique to this study. The compact group\ncandidates in these samples have a median stellar mass independent of redshift.\nGroups with velocity dispersion $\\leq 100$ km s$^{-1}$ show abundant evidence\nfor ongoing dynamical interactions among the members. The number density of the\nvolume-limited catalogs agrees with previous catalogs at the lowest redshifts\nbut decreases as the redshift increases. The SDSS fiber placement constraints\nlimit the catalog completeness. In spite of this issue the volume-limited\ncatalogs provide a promising basis for detailed spatially resolved probes of\nthe impact of galaxy-galaxy interactions within similar dense systems over a\nbroad redshift range.\n", "  The escape of cosmic rays from the Galaxy leads to a gradient in the cosmic\nray pressure that acts as a force on the background plasma, in the direction\nopposite to the gravitational pull. If this force is large enough to win\nagainst gravity, a wind can be launched that removes gas from the Galaxy,\nthereby regulating several physical processes, including star formation. The\ndynamics of these cosmic ray driven winds is intrinsically non-linear in that\nthe spectrum of cosmic rays determines the characteristics of the wind\n(velocity, pressure, magnetic field) and in turn the wind dynamics affects the\ncosmic ray spectrum. Moreover, the gradient of the cosmic ray distribution\nfunction causes excitation of Alfven waves, that in turn determine the\nscattering properties of cosmic rays, namely their diffusive transport. These\neffects all feed into each other so that what we see at the Earth is the result\nof these non-linear effects. Here we investigate the launch and evolution of\nsuch winds, and we determine the implications for the spectrum of cosmic rays\nby solving together the hydrodynamical equations for the wind and the transport\nequation for cosmic rays under the action of self-generated diffusion and\nadvection with the wind and the self-excited Alfven waves.\n", "  Future dedicated radio interferometers, including HERA and SKA, are very\npromising tools that aim to study the epoch of reionization and beyond via\nmeasurements of the 21 cm signal from neutral hydrogen. Dark matter (DM)\nannihilations into charged particles change the thermal history of the Universe\nand, as a consequence, affect the 21 cm signal. Accurately predicting the\neffect of DM strongly relies on the modeling of annihilations inside halos. In\nthis work, we use up-to-date computations of the energy deposition rates by the\nproducts from DM annihilations, a proper treatment of the contribution from DM\nannihilations in halos, as well as values of the annihilation cross section\nallowed by the most recent cosmological measurements from the Planck satellite.\nGiven current uncertainties on the description of the astrophysical processes\ndriving the epochs of reionization, X-ray heating and Lyman-$\\alpha$ pumping,\nwe find that disentangling DM signatures from purely astrophysical effects,\nrelated to early-time star formation processes or late-time galaxy X-ray\nemissions, will be a challenging task. We conclude that only annihilations of\nDM particles with masses of $\\sim100$ MeV, could leave an unambiguous imprint\non the 21 cm signal and, in particular, on the 21 cm power spectrum. This is in\ncontrast to previous, more optimistic results in the literature, which have\nclaimed that strong signatures might also be present even for much higher DM\nmasses. Additional measurements of the 21 cm signal at different cosmic epochs\nwill be crucial in order to break the strong parameter degeneracies between DM\nannihilations and astrophysical effects and undoubtedly single out a DM imprint\nfor masses different from $\\sim100$ MeV.\n", "  Understanding disk evolution and dissipation is essential for studies of\nplanet formation. Transition disks, i.e., disks with large dust cavities and\ngaps, are promising candidates of active evolution. About two dozen\nSED-selected candidates have been confirmed to have dust cavities through\nmillimeter interferometric imaging, but this sample is biased towards the\nbrightest disks. The Spitzer surveys of nearby low-mass star forming regions\nhave resulted in more than 4000 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Using color\ncriteria we have selected a sample of ~150 candidates, and an additional 40\ncandidates and known transition disks from the literature. The Spitzer data\nwere complemented by new observations at longer wavelengths, including new JCMT\nand APEX submillimeter photometry, and WISE and Herschel-PACS mid and\nfar-infrared photometry. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy was obtained and\nstellar types were derived for 85% of the sample, including information from\nthe literature. The SEDs were fit to a grid of RADMC-3D disk models with a\nlimited number of parameters: disk mass, inner disk mass, scale height and\nflaring, and disk cavity radius, where the latter is the main parameter of\ninterest. A large fraction of the targets possibly have dust cavities based on\nthe SED. The derived cavity sizes are consistent with imaging/modeling results\nin the literature, where available. Trends are found with Ldisk/Lstar and\nstellar mass and a possible connection with exoplanet orbital radii. A\ncomparison with a previous study where color observables are used (Cieza et al.\n2010) reveals large overlap between their category of planet-forming disks and\nour transition disks with cavities. A large number of the new transition disk\ncandidates are suitable for follow-up observations with ALMA.\n", "  We report direct, time-resolved observations of single-photon superradiance\nin a highly extended, elliptical sample of cold 87Rb atoms. The observed rapid\ndecay rate is accompanied by its counterpart, the cooperative Lamb shift. The\nrate of the strongly directional decay, and the associated shift, scale\nlinearly with the number of atoms and show a strong dependence on the sample\nshape, demonstrating the collective nature of the observed quantities.\n", "  We investigate the dependency of Higgs inflation on the non-renormalisable\nmatching between the low energy Standard Model limit and the inflationary\nregime at high energies. We show that for the top mass range $m_t \\gtrsim\n171.8$ GeV the scenario robustly predicts the spectral index $n_s \\simeq 0.97$\nand the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\simeq 0.003$. The matching is however\nnon-trivial, even the best-fit values $m_h=125.09$ GeV and $m_t=173.21$ GeV\nrequire a jump $\\delta \\lambda \\sim 0.01$ in the Higgs coupling below the\ninflationary scale. For $m_t\\lesssim 171.8$ GeV, the matching may generate a\nfeature in the inflationary potential. In this case the predicted values of\n$n_s$ and $r$ vary but the model is still falsifiable. For example, a detection\nof negative running of spectral index at level $\\alpha_s \\lesssim -0.01$ would\nrule out Higgs inflation.\n", "  In two recent papers (Phys. Rev. A90 (2014), 062121 and Phys. Rev. A91\n(2015), 052110) an interesting method of analyzing the violation of Bell\ninequalities has been proposed which is based on the theory of finite group\nrepresentations. We apply here this method to more complicated example of $S_4$\nsymmetry. We show how the Bell inequality can be related to the symmetries of\nregular tetrahedron. By choosing the orbits of threedimensional representation\nof $S_4$ determined by the geometry of tetrahedron we find that the Bell\ninequality under consideration is violated in quantum theory. The corresponding\nnonlocal game is analyzed.\n", "  The last two decades have seen a great improvement in our understand- ing of\nthe complex phenomenology observed in transient black-hole binary systems,\nespecially thanks to the activity of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite,\ncom- plemented by observations from many other X-ray observatories and\nground-based radio, optical and infrared facilities. Accretion alone cannot\ndescribe accurately the intricate behavior associated with black-hole\ntransients and it is now clear that the role played by different kinds of\n(often massive) outflows seen at different phases of the outburst evolution of\nthese systems is as fundamental as the one played by the accretion process\nitself. The spectral-timing states originally identified in the X-rays and\nfundamentally based on the observed effect of accretion, have acquired new\nimportance as they now allow to describe within a coherent picture the\nphenomenology observed at other wave- length, where the effects of ejection\nprocesses are most evident. With a particular focus on the phenomenology seen\nin the X-ray band, we review the current state-of-the-art of our knowledge of\nblack hole transients, describing the accretion-ejection connection at play\nduring outbursts through the evolution of the observed spectral-timing\nproperties. Although we mainly concentrate on the ob- servational aspects of\nthe global X-ray transient picture, we also provide physical insight to it by\nreviewing (when available) the theoretical explanations and models proposed to\nexplain the observed phenomenology.\n", "  Interarm star formation contributes significantly to a galaxy's star\nformation budget, and provides an opportunity to study stellar birthplaces\nunperturbed by spiral arm dynamics. Using optical integral field spectroscopy\nof the nearby galaxy NGC 628 with VLT/MUSE, we construct Halpha maps including\ndetailed corrections for dust extinction and stellar absorption to identify 391\nHII regions at 35pc resolution over 12 kpc^2. Using tracers sensitive to the\nunderlying gravitational potential, we associate HII regions with either arm\n(271) or interarm (120) environments. Using our full spectral coverage of each\nregion, we find that most HII region physical properties (luminosity, size,\nmetallicity, ionization parameter) are independent of environment. We calculate\nthe fraction of Halpha luminosity due to the diffuse ionized gas (DIG)\nbackground contaminating each HII region, and find the DIG surface brightness\nto be higher within HII regions compared to the surroundings, and slightly\nhigher within arm HII regions. Use of the temperature sensitive [SII]/Halpha\nline ratio map instead of the Halpha surface brightness to identify HII region\nboundaries does not change this result. Using the dust attenuation as a tracer\nof the gas, we find depletion times consistent with previous work (2 x 10^9 yr)\nwith no differences between the arm and interarm, however this is very\nsensitive to the DIG correction. Unlike molecular clouds, which can be\ndynamically affected by the galactic environment, we see fairly consistent HII\nregion properties in both arm and interarm environments. This suggests either a\ndifference in arm star formation and feedback, or a decoupling of dense star\nforming clumps from the more extended surrounding molecular gas.\n", "  Revised formulas for the inclusive cross section of a triple parton\nscattering process in a hadron collision are suggested basing on the modified\ncollinear three-parton distributions. The possible phenomenological issues are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We examine the scenario of a warped extra dimension containing bulk SM fields\nin light of the observed diphoton excess at 750 GeV. We demonstrate that a\nspin-2 graviton whose action contains localized kinetic brane terms for both\ngravity and gauge fields is compatible with the excess, while being consistent\nwith all other constraints. The graviton sector of this model contains a single\nfree parameter, once the mass of the graviton is fixed. The scale of physics on\nthe IR-brane is found to lie in the range of a $\\sim$ few TeV, relevant to the\ngauge hierarchy. There remains significant flexibility in the coupled\ngauge/fermion KK sectors to address the strong constraints arising from\nprecision measurements.\n", "  Estimating the temperature of the solar wind particles and their anisotropies\nis particularly important for understanding the origin of these deviations from\nthermal equilibrium as well as their effects. In the absence of energetic\nevents the velocity distribution of electrons reveal a dual structure with a\nthermal (Maxwellian) core and a suprathermal (Kappa) halo. This paper presents\na detailed observational analysis of these two components, providing\nestimations of their temperatures and temperature anisotropies and decoding any\npotential interdependence that their properties may indicate. The data set used\nin this study includes more than 120$\\,$000 the events detected by three\nmissions in the ecliptic within an extended range of heliocentric distances\nfrom 0.3 to over 4~AU. The anti-correlation found for the core and halo\ntemperatures is consistent with the radial evolution of the Kappa model,\nclarifying an apparent contradiction in previous observational analysis and\nproviding valuable clues about the temperature of the Kappa-distributed\npopulations. However, these two components manifest a clear tendency to deviate\nfrom isotropy in the same direction, that seems to confirm the existence of\nmechanisms with similar effects on both components, e.g., the solar wind\nexpansion, or the particle heating by the fluctuations. On the other hand, the\nexistence of plasma states with anti-correlated anisotropies of the core and\nhalo populations suggests a dynamic interplay of these components, mediated,\nmost probably, by the anisotropy-driven instabilities.\n", "  We demonstrate that phase-dependent heat currents through\nsuperconductor-topological insulator Josephson junctions provide a useful tool\nto probe the existence of topological Andreev bound states, even for\nmulti-channel surface states. We predict that in the tunneling regime\ntopological Andreev bound states lead to a minimum of the thermal conductance\nfor a phase difference $\\phi=\\pi$, in clear contrast to a maximum of the\nthermal conductance at $\\phi=\\pi$ that occurs for trivial Andreev bound states\nin superconductor-normal metal tunnel junctions. This opens up the possibility\nthat phase-dependent heat transport can distinguish between topologically\ntrivial and nontrivial 4$\\pi$ modes. Furthermore, we propose a superconducting\nquantum interference device geometry where phase-dependent heat currents can be\nmeasured using available experimental technology.\n", "  We discuss the method to compute the integrals which appear in the retarded\npotential term for a real-time simulation based on QED (Quantum\nElectrodynamics). We show that the oscillatory integrals over the infinite\ninterval involved in them can be efficiently performed by the method developed\nby Ooura and Mori based on the double exponential (DE) formula.\n", "  A poisson process $P_{\\lambda}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with causal structure\ninherited from the the usual Minkowski metric on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ has a\nnormalised discrete causal distance $D_{\\lambda}(x,y)$ given by the height of\nthe longest causal chain normalised by $\\lambda^{1/d}c_{d}$. We prove that\n$P_{\\lambda}$ restricted to a compact set $Q$ converges in probability in the\nsense of Noldus to $Q$ with the Minkowksi metric.\n", "  We simulate the growth of a Population III stellar system, starting from\ncosmological initial conditions at z=100. We follow the formation of a minihalo\nand the subsequent collapse of its central gas to high densities, resolving\nscales as small as ~ 1 AU. Using sink particles to represent the growing\nprotostars, we model the growth of the photodissociating and ionizing region\naround the first sink, continuing the simulation for ~ 5000 yr after initial\nprotostar formation. Along with the first-forming sink, several tens of\nsecondary sinks form before an ionization front develops around the most\nmassive star. The resulting cluster has high rates of sink formation, ejections\nfrom the stellar disc, and sink mergers during the first ~ 2000 yr, before the\nonset of radiative feedback. By this time a warm ~ 5000 K phase of neutral gas\nhas expanded to roughly the disc radius of 2000 AU, slowing mass flow onto the\ndisc and sinks. By 5000 yr the most massive star grows to 20 M_sol, while the\ntotal stellar mass approaches 75 M_sol. Out of the ~ 40 sinks, approximately 30\nare low-mass (M_* < 1 M_sol), and if the simulation had resolved smaller scales\nan even greater number of sinks might have formed. Thus, protostellar radiative\nfeedback is insufficient to prevent rapid disc fragmentation and the formation\nof a high-member Pop III cluster before an ionization front emerges. Throughout\nthe simulation, the majority of stellar mass is contained within the most\nmassive stars, further implying that the Pop III initial mass function is\ntop-heavy.\n", "  In 1921 Bach and Weyl derived the method of superposition to construct new\naxially symmetric vacuum solutions of General Relativity. In this paper we\nextend the Bach-Weyl approach to non-vacuum configurations with massless scalar\nfields. Considering a phantom scalar field with the negative kinetic energy, we\nconstruct a multi-wormhole solution describing an axially symmetric\nsuperposition of $N$ wormholes. The solution found is static, everywhere\nregular and has no event horizons. These features drastically tell the\nmulti-wormhole configuration from other axially symmetric vacuum solutions\nwhich inevitably contain gravitationally inert singular structures, such as\n`struts' and `membranes', that keep the two bodies apart making a stable\nconfiguration. However, the multi-wormholes are static without any singular\nstruts. Instead, the stationarity of the multi-wormhole configuration is\nprovided by the phantom scalar field with the negative kinetic energy. Anther\nunusual property is that the multi-wormhole spacetime has a complicated\ntopological structure. Namely, in the spacetime there exist $2^N$\nasymptotically flat regions connected by throats.\n", "  Recent observations of galaxies at $z \\gtrsim 7$, along with the low value of\nthe electron scattering optical depth measured by the Planck mission, make\ngalaxies plausible as dominant sources of ionizing photons during the epoch of\nreionization. However, scenarios of galaxy-driven reionization hinge on the\nassumption that the average escape fraction of ionizing photons is\nsignificantly higher for galaxies in the reionization epoch than in the local\nUniverse. The NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will\nenable spectroscopic observations of large samples of reionization-epoch\ngalaxies. While the leakage of ionizing photons will not be directly measurable\nfrom these spectra, the leakage is predicted to have an indirect effect on the\nspectral slope and the strength of nebular emission lines in the rest-frame\nultraviolet and optical. Here, we apply a machine learning technique known as\nlasso regression on mock JWST/NIRSpec observations of simulated $z=7$ galaxies\nin order to obtain a model that can predict the escape fraction from\nJWST/NIRSpec data. Barring systematic biases in the simulated spectra, our\nmethod is able to retrieve the escape fraction with a mean absolute error of\n$\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{esc}} \\approx 0.12$ for spectra with $S/N\\approx 5$ at a\nrest-frame wavelength of 1500 {\\AA} for our fiducial simulation. This\nprediction accuracy represents a significant improvement over previous similar\napproaches.\n", "  We propose a matrix quantum mechanics for a class of non-Abelian quantum Hall\nstates. The model describes electrons which carry an internal SU(p) spin. The\nground states of the matrix model include spin-singlet generalisations of the\nMoore-Read and Read-Rezayi states and, in general, lie in a class previously\nintroduced by Blok and Wen. The effective action for these states is a U(p)\nChern-Simons theory. We show how the matrix model can be derived from\nquantisation of the vortices in this Chern-Simons theory and how the matrix\nmodel ground states can be reconstructed as correlation functions in the\nboundary WZW model.\n", "  The Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) is an all sky gamma-ray monitor well\nknown in the gamma-ray burst community. Although GBM excels in detecting the\nhard, bright extragalactic GRBs, its sensitivity above 8 keV and all-sky view\nmake it an excellent instrument for the detection of rare, short-lived Galactic\ntransients. In March 2010, we initiated a systematic search for transients\nusing GBM data. We conclude this phase of the search by presenting a 3 year\ncatalog of 1084 X-ray bursts. Using spectral analysis, location and spatial\ndistributions we classified the 1084 events into 752 thermonuclear X-ray\nbursts, 267 transient events from accretion flares and X-ray pulses, and 65\nuntriggered gamma-ray bursts. All thermonuclear bursts have peak blackbody\ntemperatures broadly consistent with photospheric radius expanison (PRE)\nbursts. We find an average rate of 1.4 PRE bursts per day, integrated over all\nGalactic bursters within about 10 kpc. These include 33 and 10 bursts from the\nultra-compact X-ray binaries 4U~0614+09 and 2S~0918-549, respectively. We\ndiscuss these recurrence times and estimate the total mass ejected by PRE\nbursts in our Galaxy.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of circumbinary accretion onto eccentric and\ncircular binaries using the moving-mesh code AREPO. This is the first set of\nsimulations to tackle the problem of binary accretion using a finite-volume\nscheme on a freely moving mesh, which allows for accurate measurements of\naccretion onto individual stars for arbitrary binary eccentricity. While\naccretion onto a circular binary shows bursts with period of ~5 times the\nbinary period P_b,accretion onto an eccentric binary is predominantly modulated\nat the period ~1P_b. For an equal-mass circular binary, the accretion rates\nonto individual stars are quite similar to each other, following the same\nvariable pattern in time. By contrast, for eccentric binaries, one of the stars\ncan accrete at a rate 10-20 times larger than its companion. This \"symmetry\nbreaking\" between the stars, however, alternates over timescales of order 200\nP_b, and can be attributed to a slowly precessing, eccentric circumbinary disk.\nOver longer timescales, the net accretion rates onto individual stars are the\nsame, reaching a quasi-steady state with the circumbinary disk. These results\nhave important implications for the accretion behavior of binary T-Tauri stars\nand supermassive binary black holes.\n", "  The potential of using cluster clustering for calibrating the mass-observable\nrelation of galaxy clusters has been recognized theoretically for over a\ndecade. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of this technique to achieve high\nprecision mass calibration using redMaPPer clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey North Galactic Cap. By including cross-correlations between several\nrichness bins in our analysis we significantly improve the statistical\nprecision of our mass constraints. The amplitude of the mass-richness relation\nis constrained to 7% statistical precision. However, the error budget is\nsystematics dominated, reaching an 18% total error that is dominated by\ntheoretical uncertainty in the bias-mass relation for dark matter halos. We\nperform a detailed treatment of the effects of assembly bias on our analysis,\nfinding that the contribution of such effects to our parameter uncertainties is\nsomewhat greater than that of measurement noise. We confirm the results from\nMiyatake et al. (2015) that the clustering amplitude of redMaPPer clusters\ndepends on galaxy concentration, and provide additional evidence in support of\nthis effect being due to some form of assembly bias. The results presented here\ndemonstrate the power of cluster clustering for mass calibration and cosmology\nprovided the current theoretical systematics can be ameliorated.\n", "  We present an algorithmic method for the digital quantum simulation of\nmany-body locally indivisible non-Markovian open quantum systems. It consists\nof two parts: firstly, a Suzuki-Lie-Trotter decomposition of the global system\npropagator into the product of subsystem propagators, which may not be quantum\nchannels, and secondly, an algorithmic procedure for the implementation of the\nsubsystem propagators through unitary operations and measurements on a dilated\nspace. By providing rigorous error bounds for the relevant Suzuki-Lie-Trotter\ndecomposition, we are able to analyze the efficiency of the method, and connect\nit with an appropriate measure of the local indivisibility of the system. In\nlight of our analysis, the proposed method is expected to be experimentally\nachievable for a variety of interesting cases.\n", "  Fluctuations in the physical properties of biological machines are\ninextricably linked to their functions. Distributions of run-lengths and\nvelocities of processive molecular motors, like kinesin-1, are accessible\nthrough single molecule techniques, yet there is lack a rigorous theoretical\nmodel for these probabilities up to now. We derive exact analytic results for a\nkinetic model to predict the resistive force ($F$) dependent velocity ($P(v)$)\nand run-length ($P(n)$) distribution functions of generic finitely processive\nmolecular motors that take forward and backward steps on a track. Our theory\nquantitatively explains the zero force kinesin-1 data for both $P(n)$ and\n$P(v)$ using the detachment rate as the only parameter, thus allowing us to\nobtain the variations of these quantities under load. At non-zero $F$, $P(v)$\nis non-Gaussian, and is bimodal with peaks at positive and negative values of\n$v$. The prediction that $P(v)$ is bimodal is a consequence of the discrete\nstep-size of kinesin-1, and remains even when the step-size distribution is\ntaken into account. Although the predictions are based on analyses of kinesin-1\ndata, our results are general and should hold for any processive motor, which\nwalks on a track by taking discrete steps.\n", "  Asteroseismology is an unique and powerful tool to detect the internal\nstructure of stars. CBS 114 is the sixth known pulsating DBV star. It was\nobserved by Handler, Metcalfe, \\& Wood at South African Astronomical\nObservatory over 3 weeks in 2001. Then, it was observed by Metcalfe et al. at\nBohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory and McDonald Observatory respectively\nfor 7 nights in 2004. Totally 2 triplets, 4 doublets, and 5 singlets were\nidentified. The frequency splitting values are very different, from 5.2 $\\mu$Hz\nto 11.9 $\\mu$Hz, which may reflect differential rotations. We evolve grids of\nwhite dwarf models by \\texttt{MESA}. Cores, added with He/C envelopes, of those\nwhite dwarf models are inserted into \\texttt{WDEC} to evolve grids of DBV star\nmodels. With those DBV star models, we calculate eigenperiods. Those calculated\nperiods are used to fit observed periods. A best-fitting model is selected. The\nparameters are $T_{eff}$ = 25000 K, $M_{*}$ = 0.740 $M_{\\odot}$, and\nlog($M_{He}/M_{*}$) = -4.5. With the massive stellar mass, the effective\ntemperature is close to previous spectroscopic result. In addition, kinetic\nenergy distributions are calculated for the best-fitting model. We find that\nthe observed modes with large frequency splitting values are fitted by the\ncalculated modes with much kinetic energy distributed in C/O core. After\npreliminary analysis, we suggest that the C/O core may rotate at least 2 times\nfaster than the helium layer for CBS 114.\n", "  We suggest how to consistently calculate the anomalous dimension $\\gamma_*$\nof the $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ operator in finite order perturbation theory at an\ninfrared fixed point for asymptotically free theories. If the $n+1$ loop beta\nfunction and $n$ loop anomalous dimension are known then $\\gamma_*$ can be\ncalculated exactly and fully scheme independently through $O(\\Delta_f^n )$\nwhere $\\Delta_f = \\bar{N_f} - N_f$ and $N_f$ is the number of flavors and\n$\\bar{N}_f$ is the number of flavors above which asymptotic freedom is lost.\nFor a supersymmetric theory the calculation preserves supersymmetry order by\norder in $\\Delta_f$. We then compute $\\gamma_*$ through $O(\\Delta_f^2)$ for\nsupersymmetric QCD in the $\\overline{\\text{DR}}$ scheme and find that it\nmatches the exact known result. We find that $\\gamma_*$ is astonishingly well\ndescribed in perturbation theory already at the few loops level throughout the\nentire conformal window. We finally compute $\\gamma_*$ through $O(\\Delta_f^3)$\nfor QCD and a variety of other non-supersymmetric fermionic gauge theories.\nSmall values of $\\gamma_*$ are observed for a large range of flavors.\n", "  Several searches have found evidence of $^{60}$Fe deposition, presumably from\na near-Earth supernova (SN), with concentrations that vary in different\nlocations on Earth. This paper examines various influences on the path of\ninterstellar dust carrying $^{60}$Fe from a SN through the heliosphere, with\nthe aim of estimating the final global distribution on the ocean floor. We\nstudy the influences of magnetic fields, angle of arrival, wind and ocean\ncycling of SN material on the concentrations at different locations. We find\nthat the passage of SN material through the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT)\nis the greatest influence on the final global distribution, with ocean cycling\ncausing lesser alteration as the SN material sinks to the ocean floor. SN\ndistance estimates in previous works that assumed a uniform distribution are a\ngood approximation. Including the effects on surface distributions, we estimate\na distance of $46^{+10}_{-6}$ pc for a $8-10 \\ M_{\\odot}$ SN progenitor. This\nis consistent with a SN occurring within the Tuc-Hor stellar group $\\sim$2.8\nMyr ago with SN material arriving on Earth $\\sim$2.2 Myr ago. We note that the\nSN dust retains directional information to within $1^{\\circ}$ through its\narrival in the inner Solar System, so that SN debris deposition on inert bodies\nsuch as the Moon will be anisotropic, and thus could in principle be used to\ninfer directional information. In particular, we predict that existing lunar\nsamples should show measurable $^{60}$Fe differences.\n", "  We examine the evolution of late-time, optical nebular features of Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia) using a sample consisting of 160 spectra of 27 normal SNe\nIa taken from the literature as well as unpublished spectra of SN 2008Q and\nASASSN-14lp. Particular attention was given to nebular features between\n4000-6000 A in terms of temporal changes in width and central wavelength.\nAnalysis of the prominent late-time 4700 A feature shows a progressive central\nwavelength shift from ~4600 A to longer wavelengths out to at least day +300\nfor our entire sample. We find no evidence for the feature's red-ward shift\nslowing or halting at an [Fe III] blend centroid of 4701 A as has been\nproposed. The width of the feature also steadily increases with a FWHM ~170 A\nat day +100 growing to 200 A or more by day +350. Two weaker adjacent features\naround 4850 and 5000 A exhibit very similar red shifts to that of the 4700 A\nfeature but show no change in width until very late times. We discuss possible\ncauses for the observed red-ward shifting of these late-time optical features\nincluding contribution from [Co II] emission at early nebular epochs and the\nemergence of additional features at later times. We conclude that the\nubiquitous red shift of these common late-time, nebular SN Ia spectral features\nis not mainly due to a decrease in a blueshift of forbidden Fe lines but the\nresult, in part, of decreasing velocity and/or optical depth of permitted Fe\nlines.\n", "  We present CO(1-0) observations of objects within the Shocked POststarburst\nGalaxy Survey taken with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM)\n30m single dish and the Combined Array for Research for Millimeter Astronomy\n(CARMA) interferometer. Shocked Poststarburst Galaxies (SPOGs) represent a\ntransitioning population of galaxies, with deep Balmer absorption (Hdelta>5A),\nconsistent with an intermediate-age (A-star) stellar population, and ionized\ngas line ratios inconsistent with pure star formation. The CO(1-0) subsample\nwas selected from SPOGs detected by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\nwith 22um flux detected at a signal-to-noise (S/N)>3. Of the 52 objects\nobserved in CO(1-0), 47 are detected with S/N>3. A large fraction (37-46%) of\nour CO-SPOG sample were visually classified as morphologically disrupted. The\nH2 masses detected were between 10^(8.7-10.8) Msuns, consistent with the gas\nmasses found in normal galaxies, though approximately an order of magnitude\nlarger than the range seen in poststarburst galaxies. When comparing the 22um\nand CO(1-0) fluxes, SPOGs diverge from the normal star-forming relation, having\n22um fluxes in excess by a factor of <EMIR,SPOG>=4.91+0.42-0.39. The Na I D\ncharacteristics of CO-SPOGs show that it is likely that many of these objects\nhost interstellar winds. Objects with the large Na I D enhancements also tend\nto emit in the radio, suggesting possible AGN-driving of neutral winds.\n", "  The present paper constitutes the development of our previous work devoted to\ncalculations of the angular Fock coefficients, $\\psi_{k,p}(\\alpha,\\theta)$. The\nexplicit analytic representations for the edge components $\\psi_{k,0}^{(0)}$\nand $\\psi_{k,0}^{(k)}$ with $k\\leq8$ are derived. The methods developed enable\nsuch a calculation for arbitrary $k$. The single-series representation for\nsubcomponent $\\psi_{3,0}^{(2e)}$ missed in the previous paper is developed. It\nis shown how to express some of the complicated subcomponents through the\nhypergeometric and the elementary functions, as well. Using the specific\noperator of the Wolfram Mathematica, the simple explicit representations for\nsome complex mathematical objects under consideration are obtained.\n", "  We present a method for parametrizing linear cosmological perturbations of\ntheories of gravity, around homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds. The method\nis sufficiently general and systematic that it can be applied to theories with\nany degrees of freedom (DoFs) and arbitrary gauge symmetries. In this paper, we\nfocus on scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories, invariant under linear\ncoordinate transformations. In the case of scalar-tensor theories, we use our\nframework to recover the simple parametrizations of linearized Horndeski and\n\"Beyond Horndeski\" theories, and also find higher-derivative corrections. In\nthe case of vector-tensor theories, we first construct the most general\nquadratic action for perturbations that leads to second-order equations of\nmotion, which propagates two scalar DoFs. Then we specialize to the case in\nwhich the vector field is time-like (\\`a la Einstein-Aether gravity), where the\ntheory only propagates one scalar DoF. As a result, we identify the complete\nforms of the quadratic actions for perturbations, and the number of free\nparameters that need to be defined, to cosmologically characterize these two\nbroad classes of theories.\n", "  Berry phase physics is closely related to a number of topological states of\nmatter. Recently discovered topological semimetals are believed to host a\nnontrivial $\\pi$ Berry phase to induce a phase shift of $\\pm 1/8$ in the\nquantum oscillation ($+$ for hole and $-$ for electron carriers). We\ntheoretically study the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation of Weyl and Dirac\nsemimetals, taking into account their topological nature and inter-Landau band\nscattering. For a Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, the phase\nshift is found to change nonmonotonically and go beyond known values of $\\pm\n1/8$ and $\\pm 5/8$. For a Dirac semimetal or paramagnetic Weyl semimetal,\ntime-reversal symmetry leads to a discrete phase shift of $\\pm 1/8$ or $\\pm\n5/8$, as a function of the Fermi energy. Different from the previous works, we\nfind that the topological band inversion can lead to beating patterns in the\nabsence of Zeeman splitting. We also find the resistivity peaks should be\nassigned integers in the Landau index plot. Our findings may account for recent\nexperiments in Cd$_2$As$_3$ and should be helpful for exploring the Berry phase\nin various 3D systems.\n", "  At high redshift, starburst galaxies present irregular morphologies, with\n10-20\\%\\ of their star formation occurring in giant clumps. These clumpy\ngalaxies are considered to be the progenitors of local disk galaxies. To\nunderstand the properties of starbursts at intermediate and low redshift, it is\nfundamental to track their evolution and possible link with the systems at\nhigher $z$. We present an extensive, systematic, and multi-band search and\nanalysis of the starburst galaxies at redshift ($0 < z < 0.5$) in the COSMOS\nfield, as well as detailed characteristics of their star-forming clumps by\nusing Hubble Space Telescope/Advance Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) images. Their\nprincipal properties, sizes, masses, and star formation rates are provided. The\nindividual star-forming knots in our sample follow the same L(H$\\alpha$) vs.\nsize scaling relation than local giant HII regions (Fuentes-Masip et al. 2000).\nHowever, they slightly differ from the one provided using samples at high\nredshift. This result highlights the importance of spatially resolving the\nstar-forming regions for this kind of study. Star-forming clumps in the central\nregions of Mknots galaxies are more massive, and present higher star formation\nrates, than those in the outskirts. This trend is smeared when we consider\neither the mass surface density or surface star formation rate. Sknot galaxies\ndo show properties similar to both dwarf elliptical and irregulars in the\nsurface brightness ($\\mu$) versus M$_{host}$ diagram in the $B-$band (Amor\\'in\net al. 2012), and to spheroidals and ellipticals in the $\\mu$ versus M$_{host}$\ndiagram in the $V-$band (Kormendy \\&\\ Bender 2012). Sknot galaxies might be\ntransitional phases of the BCD class, with their properties consistent with\nspheroidal like, but blue structures.\n", "  Studies of the physical properties of local elliptical galaxies (e.g., gas\ntemperatures, halo masses, stellar kinematics) are shedding new light on galaxy\nformation. Here we present the hot X-ray gas properties of 33 early-type\nsystems within the MASSIVE galaxy survey sample that have archival Chandra\nX-ray observations. Through careful X-ray spectral modeling, we derive X-ray\nluminosities (L_X) and plasma temperatures (T_gas) for the diffuse gas\ncomponents in these galaxies. We combine the MASSIVE sample with 41 galaxies\nfrom the ATLAS^3D survey to investigate the X-ray and optical properties of a\nstatistically significant sample of nearby early-type galaxies across a\nwide-range of environments. We deduce that all early-type galaxies (independent\nof galaxy mass and rotational support) follow a universal scaling law such that\nL_X~T_gas^4.5. When X-ray measurements are performed consistently in apertures\nset by the galaxy stellar content, the wide-scale environment does not\ncontribute to the intrinsic scatter (~0.5dex) within the scaling relation. We\nfurther demonstrate that the scatter in L_X around both K-band luminosity (L_K)\nand the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion is primarily driven by T_gas, with\nno clear trends with halo mass, radio power, or angular momentum of the stars.\nIt is not trivial to tie the origin of the gas directly to either the stellar\nmass or the galaxy potential. Indeed, our data require a steeper relation\nbetween L_X, L_K, and sigma_e than predicted by standard mass-loss models.\nFinally, we find a statistically significant correlation between sigma_e and\nT_gas, suggesting that T_gas is set by the galaxy potential inside the optical\neffective radius. We conclude that within the inner-most 10-30kpc region,\nearly-types maintain pressure-supported hot gas, with a minimum T_gas set by\nthe virial temperature, but the majority show evidence for some additional\nheating.\n", "  Recent observations show that the Milky Way's metallicity distribution\nfunction (MDF) changes its shape as a function of radius. This new evidence of\nradial migration within the stellar disc sets additional constraints on\nGalactic models. By performing controlled test particle simulations in a very\ndetailed, observationally motivated model of the Milky Way, we demonstrate\nthat, in the inner region of the disc, the MDF is shaped by the joint action of\nthe bar and spiral arms, while at outer radii the MDF is mainly shaped by the\nspiral arms. We show that the spiral arms are able to imprint their signature\nin the radial migration, shaping the MDF in the outskirts of the Galactic disc\nwith a minimal participation of the bar. Conversely, this work has the\npotential to characterise some structural and dynamical parameters of the\nspiral arms based on radial migration and the shape of the MDF. Finally, the\nresemblance obtained with this approximation to the MDF curves of the Galaxy as\nseen by APOGEE, show that a fundamental factor influencing their shape is the\nGalactic potential.\n", "  Recently, spin excitations in doped cuprates are measured using the resonant\ninelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS). The paramagnon dispersions show the large\nhardening effect in the electron-doped systems and seemingly\ndoping-independence in the hole-doped systems, with the energy scales\ncomparable to that of the antiferromagnetic magnons. This anomalous hardening\neffect was partially explained by using the strong coupling t-J model but with\na three-site term(Nature communications 5, 3314 (2014)). However we show that\nhardening effect is a signature of strong coupling physics even without\nincluding this extra term. By considering the t-t'-t\"-J model and using the\nSlave-Boson (SB) mean field theory, we obtain, via the spin-spin\nsusceptibility, the spin excitations in qualitative agreement with the\nexperiments. These anomalies is mainly due to the doping-dependent bandwidth.\nWe further discuss the interplay between particle-hole-like and paramagnon-like\nexcitations in the RIXS measurements.\n", "  Accurate modeling of galaxy formation in a hierarchical, cold dark matter\nuniverse requires the use of sufficiently high-resolution merger trees to\nobtain convergence in the predicted properties of galaxies. When semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation models are applied to cosmological N-body simulation merger\ntrees, it is often the case that those trees have insufficient resolution to\ngive converged galaxy properties. We demonstrate a method to augment the\nresolution of N-body merger trees by grafting in branches of Monte Carlo merger\ntrees with higher resolution, but which are consistent with the pre-existing\nbranches in the N-body tree. We show that this approach leads to converged\ngalaxy properties.\n", "  We analyse the causal structure of the two dimensional (2D) reduced\nbackground used in the perturbative treatment of a head-on collision of two\n$D$-dimensional Aichelburg-Sexl gravitational shock waves. After defining all\ncausal boundaries, namely the future light-cone of the collision and the past\nlight-cone of a future observer, we obtain characteristic coordinates using two\nindependent methods. The first is a geometrical construction of the null rays\nwhich define the various light cones, using a parametric representation. The\nsecond is a transformation of the 2D reduced wave operator for the problem into\na hyperbolic form. The characteristic coordinates are then compactified\nallowing us to represent all causal light rays in a conformal Carter-Penrose\ndiagram. Our construction holds to all orders in perturbation theory. In\nparticular, we can easily identify the singularities of the source functions\nand of the Green's functions appearing in the perturbative expansion, at each\norder, which is crucial for a successful numerical evaluation of any higher\norder corrections using this method.\n", "  Recently, Zacharias et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 177401 (2015)] developed a\nnew ab initio theory of temperature-dependent optical absorption spectra and\nband gaps in semiconductors and insulators. In that work the zero-point\nrenormalization and the temperature dependence were obtained by sampling the\nnuclear wavefunctions using a stochastic approach. In the present work, we show\nthat the stochastic sampling can be replaced by fully deterministic supercell\ncalculations based on a single optimal configuration of the atomic positions.\nWe demonstrate that a single calculation is able to capture the\ntemperature-dependent band gap renormalization including quantum nuclear\neffects in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, as well as phonon-assisted\noptical absorption in indirect-gap semiconductors. In order to demonstrate this\nmethodology we calculate from first principles the temperature-dependent\noptical absorption spectra and the renormalization of direct and indirect band\ngaps in Si, C, and GaAs, and we obtain good agreement with experiment and with\nprevious calculations. In this work we also establish the formal connection\nbetween the Williams-Lax theory of optical transitions and the related theories\nof indirect absorption by Hall, Bardeen, and Blatt, and of\ntemperature-dependent band structures by Allen and Heine. Furthermore, we\nidentify an additional band gap renormalization that arises in the case of\ndegenerate band extrema, and which has not been considered in previous work.\nThe present methodology enables systematic ab initio calculations of optical\nabsorption spectra at finite temperature, including both direct and indirect\ntransitions. This feature will be useful for high-throughput calculations of\noptical properties at finite temperature, and for calculating\ntemperature-dependent optical properties using high-level theories such as GW\nand Bethe-Salpeter approaches.\n", "  The recent Advanced LIGO detection of gravitational waves from the binary\nblack hole GW150914 suggests there exists a large population of merging binary\nblack holes in the Universe. Although most are too distant to be individually\nresolved by advanced detectors, the superposition of gravitational waves from\nmany unresolvable binaries is expected to create an astrophysical stochastic\nbackground. Recent results from the LIGO and Virgo collaborations show that\nthis astrophysical background is within reach of Advanced LIGO. In principle,\nthe binary black hole background encodes interesting astrophysical properties,\nsuch as the mass distribution and redshift distribution of distant binaries.\nHowever, we show that this information will be difficult to extract with the\ncurrent configuration of advanced detectors (and using current data analysis\ntools). Additionally, the binary black hole background also constitutes a\nforeground that limits the ability of advanced detectors to observe other\ninteresting stochastic background signals, for example from cosmic strings or\nphase transitions in the early Universe. We quantify this effect.\n", "  Understanding the fracture toughness (resistance) of glasses is a fundamental\nproblem of prime theoretical and practical importance. Here we theoretically\nstudy its dependence on the loading rate, the age (history) of the glass and\nthe notch radius $\\rho$. Reduced-dimensionality analysis suggests that the\nnotch fracture toughness results from a competition between the initial, age-\nand history-dependent, plastic relaxation timescale $\\tau^{pl}_0$ and an\neffective loading timescale $\\tau^{ext}(\\dot{K}_I,\\rho)$, where $\\dot{K}_I$ is\nthe tensile stress-intensity-factor rate. The toughness is predicted to scale\nwith $\\sqrt{\\rho}$ independently of $\\xi\\!\\equiv\\!\\tau^{ext}\\!/\\tau^{pl}_0$ for\n$\\xi\\!\\ll\\! 1$, to scale as $T\\sqrt{\\rho}\\,\\log(\\xi)$ for $\\xi\\!\\gg\\!1$\n(related to thermal activation, where $T$ is the temperature) and to feature a\nnon-monotonic behavior in the crossover region $\\xi\\!\\sim\\!{\\cal O}(1)$\n(related to plastic yielding dynamics). These predictions are verified using\nnovel 2D computations, providing a unified picture of the notch fracture\ntoughness of glasses. The theory highlights the importance of timescales\ncompetition and far from steady-state elasto-viscoplastic dynamics for\nunderstanding the toughness, and shows that the latter varies quite\nsignificantly with the glass age (history) and applied loading rate.\nExperimental support for bulk metallic glasses is presented.\n", "  The study of short-duration gamma-ray bursts provides growing evidence that a\ngood fraction of double neutron star mergers lead to the formation of stable\nmillisecond magnetars. The launch of Poynting flux by the millisecond magnetars\ncould leave distinct electromagnetic signatures that reveal the energy\ndissipation processes in the magnetar wind. In previous studies (Wang & Dai\n2013b; Wang et al. 2015), we assume that the magnetar wind becomes completely\nlepton-dominated so that electrons/positrons in the magnetar wind are\naccelerated by a diffusive shock. However, theoretical modeling of pulsar wind\nnebulae shows that in many cases the magnetic field energy in the pulsar wind\nmay be strong enough to suppress diffusive shock acceleration. In this paper,\nwe investigate the reverse shock emission as well as the forward shock emission\nwith an arbitrary magnetization parameter $\\sigma$ of a magnetar wind. We find\nthat the reverse shock emission strongly depends on $\\sigma$, and in\nparticular, $\\sigma \\sim 0.3$ leads to the strongest reverse shock emission.\nFuture observations would be helpful to diagnose the composition of the\nmagnetar wind.\n", "  Modular invariance is a striking symmetry in string theory, which may keep\nstringy corrections under control. In this paper, we investigate a\nphenomenological consequence of the modular invariance, assuming that this\nsymmetry is preserved as well as in a four dimensional (4D) low energy\neffective field theory. As a concrete setup, we consider a modulus field $T$\nwhose contribution in the 4D effective field theory remains invariant under the\nmodular transformation and study inflation drived by $T$. The modular\ninvariance restricts a possible form of the scalar potenntial. As a result,\nlarge field models of inflation are hardly realized. Meanwhile, a small field\nmodel of inflation can be still accomodated in this restricted setup. The\nscalar potential traced during the slow-roll inflation mimics the hilltop\npotential $V_{ht}$, but it also has a non-negligible deviation from $V_{ht}$.\nDetecting the primordial gravitational waves predicted in this model is rather\nchallenging. Yet, we argue that it may be still possible to falsify this model\nby combining the information in the reheating process which can be determined\nself-completely in this setup.\n", "  A recent theoretical breakthrough has brought a new tool, called\n\\emph{localization landscape}, to predict the localization regions of vibration\nmodes in complex or disordered systems. Here, we report on the first experiment\nwhich measures the localization landscape and demonstrates its predictive\npower. Holographic measurement of the static deformation under uniform load of\na thin plate with complex geometry provides direct access to the landscape\nfunction. When put in vibration, this system shows modes precisely confined\nwithin the sub-regions delineated by the landscape function. Also the maxima of\nthis function match the measured eigenfrequencies, while the minima of the\nvalley network gives the frequencies at which modes become extended. This\napproach fully characterizes the low frequency spectrum of a complex structure\nfrom a single static measurement. It paves the way to the control and\nengineering of eigenmodes in any vibratory system, especially where a\nstructural or microscopic description is not accessible.\n", "  How do landscape fragmentation affects ecosystems diversity and stability is\nan important and complex question in ecology with no simple answer, as\nspatially separated habitats where species live are highly dynamic rather than\njust static. Taking into account the species dispersal among nearby connected\nhabitats (or patches) through a common dynamic environment, we model the\nconsumer-resource interactions with ring type coupled network. Characterizing\nthe dynamics of consumer-resource interactions in a coupled ecological system\nwith three fundamental mechanisms: such as the interaction within the patch,\nthe interaction between the patch and the interaction through a common dynamic\nenvironment, we report the occurrence of various atypical collective behaviors.\nWe show that, the interplay between dynamic environment and dispersal among\nconnected patches exhibits the mechanism of generation of oscillations, i.e.,\nrhythmogenesis, as well as suppression of oscillations, i.e., amplitude death\nand oscillation death. Also, the transition of homogeneous steady state to\ninhomogeneous steady state occurs through a co-dimension-2 bifurcation.\nEmphasizing a network of spatially extended system, the coupled model exposes\nthe collective behavior of synchrony-stability relationship with various\nsynchronization occurrences such as in-phase and out-of-phase.\n", "  Directed energy for planetary defense is now a viable option and is superior\nin many ways to other proposed technologies, being able to defend the Earth\nagainst all known threats. This paper presents basic ideas behind a directed\nenergy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to\nimpart a deflecting force on the target. A conceptual philosophy called\nDE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and\nexploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other\npapers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as\na reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a\ndirected energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high\nsurface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an\nejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the\nobject. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses\nconventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the\nspacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation,\nthe asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest\nspacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a\nsystem of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity\ntractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m\ndiameter) asteroid with a 1- to 15-year targeting time (laser on time)\ndepending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission\nparameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and\nsize. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than\ncurrent proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect\nall known threats with sufficient warning.\n", "  The next generation of cosmology experiments will be required to use\nphotometric redshifts rather than spectroscopic redshifts. Obtaining accurate\nand well-characterized photometric redshift distributions is therefore critical\nfor Euclid, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square Kilometre Array.\nHowever, determining accurate variance predictions alongside single point\nestimates is crucial, as they can be used to optimize the sample of galaxies\nfor the specific experiment (e.g. weak lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations,\nsupernovae), trading off between completeness and reliability in the galaxy\nsample. The various sources of uncertainty in measurements of the photometry\nand redshifts put a lower bound on the accuracy that any model can hope to\nachieve. The intrinsic uncertainty associated with estimates is often\nnon-uniform and input-dependent, commonly known in statistics as\nheteroscedastic noise. However, existing approaches are susceptible to outliers\nand do not take into account variance induced by non-uniform data density and\nin most cases require manual tuning of many parameters. In this paper, we\npresent a Bayesian machine learning approach that jointly optimizes the model\nwith respect to both the predictive mean and variance we refer to as Gaussian\nprocesses for photometric redshifts (GPz). The predictive variance of the model\ntakes into account both the variance due to data density and photometric noise.\nUsing the SDSS DR12 data, we show that our approach substantially outperforms\nother machine learning methods for photo-z estimation and their associated\nvariance, such as TPZ and ANNz2. We provide a Matlab and Python implementations\nthat are available to download at https://github.com/OxfordML/GPz .\n", "  We present 321 GHz observations of five AGN from ALMA Cycle 0 archival data:\nNGC 5793, NGC 1068, NGC 1386, NGC 4945, and the Circinus galaxy. Submillimeter\nmaser emission is detected for the first time towards NGC 4945, and we present\na new analysis of the submillimeter maser system in Circinus. None of the other\nthree galaxies show maser emission, though we have detected and imaged the\ncontinuum from every galaxy. Both NGC 4945 and Circinus are known to host\nstrong ($\\gtrsim 10$ Jy) 22 GHz megamaser emission, and VLBI observations have\nshown that the masers reside in the innermost $\\sim 1$ parsec of the galaxies.\nThe peak flux densities of the 321 GHz masers in both systems are substantially\nweaker (by a factor of $\\sim$100) than what is observed at 22 GHz, though the\ncorresponding isotropic luminosities are more closely matched (within a factor\nof $\\sim$10) between the two transitions. We compare the submillimeter spectra\npresented here to the known 22 GHz spectra in both galaxies, and we argue that\nwhile both transitions originate from the gaseous environment near the AGN, not\nall sites are necessarily in common. In Circinus, the spectral structure of the\n321 GHz masers indicates that they may trace the accretion disk at radii\ninterior to the 22 GHz masers. The continuum emission in NGC 4945 and NGC 5793\nshows a spatial distribution indicative of an origin in the galactic disks\n(likely thermal dust emission), while for the other three galaxies the emission\nis centrally concentrated and likely originates from the nucleus.\n", "  We describe a geometric (or gravitational) analogue of the Laughlin\nquasiholes in the fractional quantum Hall states. Analogously to the quasiholes\nthese defects can be constructed by an insertion of an appropriate vertex\noperator into the conformal block representation of a trial wavefunction,\nhowever, unlike the quasiholes these defects are extrinsic and do not\ncorrespond to true excitations of the quantum fluid. We construct a\nwavefunction in the presence of such defects and explain how to assign an\nelectric charge and a spin to each defect, and calculate the adiabatic,\nnon-abelian statistics of the defects. The defects turn out to be equivalent to\nthe genons in that their adiabatic exchange statistics can be described in\nterms of representations of the mapping class group of an appropriate higher\ngenus Riemann surface. We present a general construction that, in principle,\nallows to calculate the statistics of $\\mathbb Z_n$ genons for any \"parent\"\ntopological phase. We illustrate the construction on the example of the\nLaughlin state and perform an explicit calculation of the braiding matrices. In\naddition to non-abelian statistics geometric defects possess a universal\nabelian overall phase, determined by the gravitational anomaly.\n", "  Point defects in the binary group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers of SnS,\nSnSe, GeS, GeSe are investigated using density-functional-theory calculations.\nSeveral stable configurations are found for oxygen defects, however we give\nevidence that these materials are less prone to oxidation than phosphorene,\nwith which monochalcogenides are isoelectronic and share the same orthorhombic\nstructure. Concurrent oxygen defects are expected to be vacancies and\nsubstitutional oxygen. We show that it is energetically favorable oxygen be\nincorporated into the layers substituting for a chalcogen (O S/Se defects), and\ndifferent from most of the other defects investigated, this defect preserves\nthe electronic structure of the material. Thus, we suggest that annealing\ntreatments can be useful for the treatment of functional materials where loss\nmechanisms due to the presence of defects are undesirable.\n", "  Quasiparticle poisoning and diabatic transitions may significantly narrow the\nwindow for the experimental observation of the $4\\pi$-periodic $dc$ Josephson\neffect predicted for topological Josephson junctions. Here, we show that\nswitching current measurements provide accessible and robust signatures for\ntopological superconductivity which persist in the presence of quasiparticle\npoisoning processes. Such measurements provide access to the phase-dependent\nsubgap spectrum and Josephson currents of the topological junction when\nincorporating it into an asymmetric SQUID together with a conventional\nJosephson junction with large critical current. We also argue that pump-probe\nexperiments with multiple current pulses can be used to measure the\nquasiparticle poisoning rates of the topological junction. The proposed\nsignatures are particularly robust, even in the presence of Zeeman fields and\nspin-orbit coupling, when focusing on short Josephson junctions. Finally, we\nalso consider microwave excitations of short topological Josephson junctions\nwhich may complement switching current measurements.\n", "  A sudden quantum quench of a Bloch band from one topological phase toward\nanother has been shown to exhibit an intimate connection with the notion of a\ndynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), where the returning probability of\nthe quenched state to the initial state---i.e. the Loschmidt echo---vanishes at\ncritical times $\\{t^{*}\\}$. Analytical results so far are limited to two-band\nmodels, leaving the exact relation between topology and DQPT unclear. In this\nwork, we show that for a general multi-band system, a robust DQPT relies on the\nexistence of nodes (i.e. zeros) in the wavefunction overlap between the initial\nband and the post-quench energy eigenstates. These nodes are topologically\nprotected if the two participating wavefunctions have distinctive topological\nindices. We demonstrate these ideas in detail for both one and two spatial\ndimensions using a three-band generalized Hofstadter model. We also discuss\npossible experimental observations.\n", "  We present a catalog of panchromatic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for\n7 M and 4 K dwarf stars that span X-ray to infrared wavelengths (5 {\\AA} - 5.5\n{\\mu}m). These SEDs are composites of Chandra or XMM-Newton data from 5 - ~50\n{\\AA}, a plasma emission model from ~50 - 100 {\\AA}, broadband empirical\nestimates from 100 - 1170 {\\AA}, HST data from 1170 - 5700 {\\AA}, including a\nreconstruction of stellar Ly{\\alpha} emission at 1215.67 {\\AA}, and a PHOENIX\nmodel spectrum from 5700 - 55000 {\\AA}. Using these SEDs, we computed the\nphotodissociation rates of several molecules prevalent in planetary atmospheres\nwhen exposed to each star's unattenuated flux (\"unshielded\" photodissociation\nrates) and found that rates differ among stars by over an order of magnitude\nfor most molecules. In general, the same spectral regions drive unshielded\nphotodissociations both for the minimally and maximally FUV active stars.\nHowever, for ozone visible flux drives dissociation for the M stars whereas NUV\nflux drives dissociation for the K stars. We also searched for an FUV continuum\nin the assembled SEDs and detected it in 5/11 stars, where it contributes\naround 10% of the flux in the range spanned by the continuum bands. An\nultraviolet continuum shape is resolved for the star {\\epsilon} Eri that shows\nan edge likely attributable to Si II recombination. The 11 SEDs presented in\nthis paper, available online through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes,\nwill be valuable for vetting stellar upper-atmosphere emission models and\nsimulating photochemistry in exoplanet atmospheres.\n", "  In this paper, by cross-correlating an archive sample of 542 extragalactic\nradio sources with the \\emph{Fermi}-LAT Third Source Catalog(3FGL), we have\ncompiled a sample of 80 $\\gamma$-ray sources and 462 non-\\emph{Fermi} sources\nwith available core dominance parameter($R_{CD}$), core and extended radio\nluminosity; all the parameters are directly measured or derived from available\ndata in the literature. We found that $R_{CD}$ have significant correlations\nwith radio core luminosities, $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and $\\gamma$-ray flux\nrespectively; the \\emph{Fermi} sources have on average higher $R_{CD}$ than\nnon-\\emph{Fermi} sources. These results indicate that the \\emph{Fermi} sources\nshould be more compact, and beaming effect should play a crucial role for the\ndetection of $\\gamma$-ray emission. Moreover, our results also show\n\\emph{Fermi} sources have systematically larger radio flux than\nnon-\\emph{Fermi} sources at fixed $R_{CD}$, indicating larger intrinsic radio\nflux in \\emph{Fermi} sources. These results show a strong connection between\nradio and $\\gamma$-ray flux for the present sample and indicate that the\nnon-\\emph{Fermi} sources is likely due to low beaming effect, and/or the low\nintrinsic $\\gamma$-ray flux, support a scenario in the literature: a co-spatial\norigin of the activity for the radio and $\\gamma$-ray emission, suggesting that\nthe origin of the seed photons for the high-energy $\\gamma$-ray emission is\nwithin the jet.\n", "  (abridged) We used the IRAM 30-m to perform a sensitive wideband survey of 30\nprotoplanetary disks in the Taurus Auriga region. We simultaneously observed\nHCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(3-2), C$_2$H(3-2), CS(5-4), and two transitions of SO. We\ncombine the results with a previous survey which observed $^{13}$CO (2-1),\nCN(2-1), two o-H$_2$CO lines and one of SO. We use available interferometric\ndata to derive excitation temperatures of CN and C$_2$H in several sources. We\ndetermine characteristic sizes of the gas disks and column densities of all\nmolecules using a parametric power-law disk model. Our study is mostly\nsensitive to molecules at 200-400 au from the stars. We compare the derived\ncolumn densities to the predictions of an extensive gas-grain chemical disk\nmodel, under conditions representative of T Tauri disks. This survey provides\n20 new detections of HCO$^+$ in disks, 18 in HCN, 11 in C$_2$H, 8 in CS and 4\nin SO. HCO$^+$ is detected in almost all sources, and its J=3-2 line is\nessentially optically thick, providing good estimates of the disk radii. The\nother transitions are (at least partially) optically thin. Variations of the\ncolumn density ratios do not correlate with any specific property of the star\nor disk. Disks around Herbig Ae stars appear less rich in molecules than those\naround T Tauri stars, although the sample remains small. SO is only found in\nthe (presumably younger) embedded objects, perhaps reflecting an evolution of\nthe S chemistry due to increasing depletion with time. Overall, the molecular\ncolumn densities, and in particular the CN/HCN and CN/C$_2$H ratios, are well\nreproduced by gas-grain chemistry in cold disks. This study provides a census\nof simple molecules in disks of radii $> 200-300$ au. Extending that to smaller\ndisks, or searching for less abundant or more complex molecules requires a much\nmore sensitive facility, i.e. NOEMA and ALMA.\n", "  We prepare number stabilized ultracold clouds through the real-time analysis\nof non-destructive images and the application of feedback. In our experiments,\nthe atom number ${N\\sim10^6}$ is determined by high precision Faraday imaging\nwith uncertainty $\\Delta_N$ below the shot noise level, i.e., $\\Delta_N\n<\\sqrt{N}$. Based on this measurement, feedback is applied to reduce the atom\nnumber to a user-defined target, whereupon a second imaging series probes the\nnumber stabilized cloud. By this method, we show that the atom number in\nultracold clouds can be prepared below the shot noise level.\n", "  We have proposed a new method for solving the problem of ship waves excited\non the surface of a non-viscous liquid by a submerged object that moves at a\nvariable speed. As a first application of this method, we have obtained a new\nsolution to the classic problem of ship waves generated by a submerged ball\nthat moves rectilinearly with constant velocity parallel to the equilibrium\nsurface of the liquid. For this example, we have derived asymptotic expressions\ndescribing the vertical displacement of the liquid surface in the limit of\nsmall and large values of the Froude number. The exact solution is presented in\nthe form of two terms, each of which is reduced to one-dimensional integrals.\nOne term describes the \"Bernoulli hump\" and another term the \"Kelvin wedge.\" As\na second example, we considered vertical oscillation of the submerged ball. In\nthis case, the solution leads to the calculation of one-dimensional integral\nand describes surface waves propagating from the epicenter above the ball.\n", "  Motivated by recent Mossbauer experiments on strongly correlated\nmixed-valence systems, we revisit the Kubo-Anderson stochastic theory of\nspectral lineshapes. Using a Majorana representation for the nuclear spin we\ndemonstrate how to recast the classic lineshape theory in a field-theoretic and\ndiagrammatic language. We show that the leading contribution to the self-energy\ncan reproduce most of the observed lineshape features including splitting and\nlineshape narrowing, while the vertex and the self-consistency corrections can\nbe systematically included in the calculation. This new approach permits us to\npredict the line-shape produced by an arbitrary bulk charge fluctuation\nspectrum providing a model-independent way to extract the local charge\nfluctuation spectrum of the surrounding medium. We also derive an inverse\nformula to extract the charge fluctuation from the measured lineshape.\n", "  Turbulent flows in the solar wind, large scale current sheets, multiple\ncurrent sheets, and shock waves lead to the formation of environments in which\na dense network of current sheets is established and sustains \"turbulent\nreconnection\". We constructed a 2D grid on which a number of randomly chosen\ngrid points are acting as scatterers (i.e. magnetic clouds or current sheets).\nOur goal is to examine how test particles respond inside this large scale\ncollection of scatterers. We study the energy gain of individual particles, the\nevolution of their energy distribution and their escape time distribution. We\nhave developed a new method to estimate the transport coefficients from the\ndynamics of the interaction of the particles with the scatterers. Replacing the\n\"magnetic clouds\" with current sheets, we have proven that the energization\nprocesses can be more efficient depending on the strength of the effective\nelectric fields inside the current sheets and their statistical properties.\nUsing the estimated transport coefficients and solving the Fokker-Planck (FP)\nequation we can recover the energy distribution of the particles only for the\nsstochastic Fermi process. We have shown that the evolution of the particles\ninside a turbulent reconnecting volume is not a solution of the FP equation,\nsince the interaction of the particles with the current sheets is \"anomalous\",\nin contrast to the case of the second order Fermi process.\n", "  On 2012 March 7, the STEREO Ahead and Behind spacecraft, along with the\nnear-earth spacecraft (e.g. SOHO, Wind) situated between the two STEREO\nspacecraft, observed an extremely large global solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent in Solar Cycle 24. Two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) have been\ndetected close in time. From the multi-point in-situ observations, it can be\nfound that this SEP event was caused by the first CME, and the second one was\nnot involved. Using the velocity dispersion analysis (VDA), we find that for\nwell magnetically connected point, the energetic protons and electrons are\nreleased nearly at the same time. The path lengths to STEREO-B(STB) of protons\nand electrons have distinct difference and deviate remarkably from the nominal\nParker spiral path length, which is likely due to the presence of\ninterplanetary magnetic structures situated between the source and the STB.\nAlso the VDA method seems only to obtain reasonable results at well-connected\nlocations and the inferred energetic particles release times in different\nenergy channels are similar. We suggest that good-connection is crucial for\nobtaining both accurate release time and path length simultaneously, agreeing\nwith the modeling result of Wang & Qin (2015).\n", "  We study the instabilities of a particle-hole symmetric Weyl metal with both\nelectron and hole Fermi surfaces (FS) around the Weyl points. For a repulsive\ninteraction, we find that the leading instability is towards a longitudinal\nspin-density-wave order (SDW$_z$). Besides, there exist three degenerate\nsubleading instabilities: a charge-density-wave (CDW) instability and two\ntransverse spin-density-wave (SDW$_{x,y}$) instabilities. For an attractive\ninteraction the leading instabilities are towards two pair-density-wave orders\n(PDW) which pair the two FS's separately. Both the PDW and SDW$_z$ order\nparameters fully gap out FS's, while the CDW and SDW$_{x,y}$ ones leave line\nnodes on both FS's. For the SDW$_z$ and the PDW states, the surface Fermi arc\nin the metallic state evolves to a chiral Fermi line which passes the\nprojection of the Weyl points and traverses the full momentum space. For the\nCDW state, the line node projects to a \"drumhead\" band localized on the\nsurface, which can lead to a topological charge polarization. We verify the\nsurface states by numerically simulating the angular-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy data.\n", "  We critically examine recent claims of a high solar metallicity by von\nSteiger \\& Zurbuchen (2016) based on \\textit{in situ} measurements of the solar\nwind, rather than the standard spectroscopically-inferred abundances (Asplund\net al. 2009). We test the claim by Vagnozzi et al. (2016) that a composition\nbased on the solar wind enables one to construct a standard solar model in\nagreement with helioseismological observations and thus solve the decades-old\nsolar modelling problem. We show that, although some helioseismological\nobservables are improved compared to models computed with spectroscopic\nabundances, most are in fact worse. The high abundance of refractory elements\nleads to an overproduction of neutrinos, with a predicted $^8$B flux that is\nnearly twice its observed value, and $^7$Be and CNO fluxes that are\nexperimentally ruled out at high confidence. A combined likelihood analysis\nshows that models using the vSZ16 abundances fare worse than AGSS09 despite a\nhigher metallicity. We also present astrophysical and spectroscopic arguments\nshowing the vSZ16 composition to be an implausible representation of the solar\ninterior, identifying the first ionisation potential effect in the outer solar\natmosphere and wind as the likely culprit.\n", "  The fraction of the Universe going into primordial black holes (PBHs) with\ninitial mass M_* \\approx 5 \\times 10^{14} g, such that they are evaporating at\nthe present epoch, is strongly constrained by observations of both the\nextragalactic and Galactic gamma-ray backgrounds. However, while the dominant\ncontribution to the extragalactic background comes from the time-integrated\nemission of PBHs with initial mass M_*, the Galactic background is dominated by\nthe instantaneous emission of those with initial mass slightly larger than M_*\nand current mass below M_*. Also, the instantaneous emission of PBHs smaller\nthan 0.4 M_* mostly comprises secondary particles produced by the decay of\ndirectly emitted quark and gluon jets. These points were missed in the earlier\nanalysis by Lehoucq et al. using EGRET data. For a monochromatic PBH mass\nfunction, with initial mass (1+\\mu) M_* and \\mu << 1, the current mass is\n(3\\mu)^{1/3} M_* and the Galactic background constrains the fraction of the\nUniverse going into PBHs as a function of \\mu. However, the initial mass\nfunction cannot be precisely monochromatic and even a tiny spread of mass\naround M_* would generate a current low-mass tail of PBHs below M_*. This tail\nwould be the main contributor to the Galactic background, so we consider its\nform and the associated constraints for a variety of scenarios with both\nextended and nearly-monochromatic initial mass functions. In particular, we\nconsider a scenario in which the PBHs form from critical collapse and have a\nmass function which peaks well above M_*. In this case, the largest PBHs could\nprovide the dark matter without the M_* ones exceeding the gamma-ray background\nlimits.\n", "  We show that fractional charges can be realized at the boundaries of a linear\narray of tunnel coupled quantum dots in the presence of a periodically\nmodulated onsite potential. While the charge fractionalization mechanism is\nsimilar to the one in polyacetylene, here the values of fractional charges can\nbe tuned to arbitrary values by varying the phase of the onsite potential or\nthe total number of dots in the array. We also find that the fractional\nboundary charges, unlike the in-gap bound states, are stable against static\nrandom disorder. We discuss the minimum array size where fractional boundary\ncharges can be observed.\n", "  We report two new tidal debris nearby the Sagittarius (Sgr) tidal stream in\nthe north Galactic cap identified from the M giant stars in LAMOST DR2 data.\nThe M giant stars with sky area of $210^\\circ<$\\Lambda$<290^\\circ$, distance of\n10--20kpc, and [Fe/H]$<-0.75$ show clear bimodality in velocity distribution.\nWe denote the two peaks as Vel-3+83 for the one within mean velocity of\n-3kms$^{-1}$ with respect to that of the well observed Sgr leading tail at the\nsame $\\Lambda$ and Vel+162+26 for the other one with mean velocity of\n162kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the Sgr leading tail. Although the projected\n$\\Lambda$--$V_{gar}$ relation of Vel-3+83 is very similar to the Sgr leading\ntail, the opposite trend in $\\Lambda$--distance relation against the Sgr\nleading tail suggests Vel-3+83 has a different 3D direction of motion with any\nbranch of the simulated Sgr tidal stream from Law & Majewski. Therefore, we\npropose it to be a new tidal debris not related to the Sgr stream. Similarly,\nthe another substructure Vel+162+26, which is the same one as the NGC group\ndiscovered by Chou et al., also moves toward a different direction with the Sgr\nstream, implying that it may have different origin with the Sgr tidal stream.\n", "  Self-interacting boson stars have been shown to alleviate the astrophysically\nlow maximal mass of their non-self-interacting counterparts. We report some\nphysical features of spinning self-interacting boson stars, namely their\ncompactness, the occurence of ergo-regions and the scalar field profiles, for a\nsample of values of the coupling parameter. The results agree with the general\npicture that these boson stars are comparatively less compact than the\nnon-self-interacting ones. We also briefly discuss the effect of scalar\nself-interactions on the properties of Kerr black holes with scalar hair.\n", "  We study a proposal for the resolution of the black hole information puzzle\nwithin the context of modified versions of quantum theory involving spontaneous\nreduction of the quantum state. The theories of this kind, which were developed\nin order to address the so called \"measurement problem\" in quantum theory have,\nin the past, been framed in a non-relativistic setting and in that form they\nwere previously applied to the black hole information problem. Here, and for\nthe first time, we show in a simple toy model, a treatment of the problem\nwithin a fully relativistic setting. We also discuss the issues that the\npresent analysis leaves as open problems to be dealt with in future refinements\nof the present approach.\n", "  We investigate the temperature dependence of the thermal dilepton rate and\nthe electrical conductivity of the gluon plasma at temperatures of $1.1T_c$,\n$1.3T_c$ and $1.5T_c$ in quenched QCD. Making use of non-perturbatively\nclover-improved Wilson valence quarks allows for a clean extrapolation of the\nvector meson correlation function to the continuum limit. We found that the\nvector correlation function divided by $T^3$ is almost temperature independent\nin the current temperature window. The spectral functions are obtained by\n$\\chi^2$ fitting of phenomenologically inspired Ans\\\"atze for the spectral\nfunction to the continuum extrapolated correlator data, where the correlations\nbetween the data points have been included. Systematic uncertainties arising\nfrom varying the Ans\\\"atze motivated from strong coupling theory as well as\nperturbation theory are discussed and estimated. We found that the electrical\nconductivity of the hot medium, related to the slope of the vector spectral\nfunction at zero frequency and momentum, is $0.2C_{em}\\lesssim\n\\sigma/T\\lesssim0.7C_{em}$ for $T=1.1T_c$ and $0.2C_{em}\\lesssim\n\\sigma/T\\lesssim0.4C_{em}$ for the higher temperatures. The dilepton rates and\nsoft photon rates, resulting from the obtained spectral functions, show no\nsignificant temperature dependence, either.\n", "  Inelastic losses in core level x-ray spectra arise from many-body\nexcitations, leading to broadening and damping as well as satellite peaks in\nx-ray photoemission (XPS) and x-ray absorption (XAS) spectra. Here we present a\npractical approach for calculating these losses based on a cumulant\nrepresentation of the particle-hole Green's function, a quasi-boson\napproximation, and a partition of the cumulant into extrinsic, intrinsic and\ninterference terms. The intrinsic losses are calculated using real-time,\ntime-dependent density functional theory while the extrinsic losses are\nobtained from the GW approximation of the photo-electron self-energy and the\ninterference terms are approximated. These effects are included in the spectra\nusing a convolution with an energy dependent particle-hole spectral function.\nThe approach elucidates the nature of the spectral functions in XPS and XAS and\nexplains the significant cancellation between extrinsic and intrinsic losses.\nEdge-singularity effects in metals are also accounted for. Illustrative results\nare presented for the XPS and XAS for both weakly and more correlated systems.\n", "  We find that the initial dust masses in planetary debris disks are correlated\nwith the metallicities of their central stars. We compiled a large sample of\nsystems, including Spitzer, the Herschel DUNES and DEBRIS surveys, and WISE\ndebris disk candidates. We also merged 33 metallicity catalogs to provide\nhomogeneous [Fe/H] and $\\sigma_{[Fe/H]}$ values. We analyzed this merged\nsample, including 222 detected disks (74 warm and 148 cold) around a total of\n187 systems (some with multiple components) and 440 disks with only upper\nlimits (125 warm and 315 cold), around a total of 360 systems. The disk dust\nmasses at a common early evolutionary point in time were determined using our\nnumerical disk evolutionary code, evolving a unique model for each of the 662\ndisks backward to an age of 1 Myr. We find that disk-bearing stars seldom have\nmetallicities less than [Fe/H] = -0.2 and that the distribution of warm\ncomponent masses lacks examples with large mass around stars of low metallicity\n([Fe/H] < -0.085). Previous efforts to find a correlation have been largely\nunsuccessful; the primary improvements supporting our result are: 1.) basing\nthe study on dust masses, not just infrared excess detections; 2.) including\nupper limits on dust mass in a quantitative way; 3.) accounting for the\nevolution of debris disk excesses as systems age; 4.) accounting fully for the\nrange of uncertainties in metallicity measurements; and 5.) having a\nstatistically large enough sample.\n", "  Recently a 6.8$\\sigma$ anomaly has been reported in the opening angle and\ninvariant mass distributions of $e^+ e^-$ pairs produced in $^8\\text{Be}$\nnuclear transitions. The data are explained by a 17 MeV vector gauge boson $X$\nthat is produced in the decay of an excited state to the ground state,\n$^8\\text{Be}^* \\to {}^8\\text{Be} \\, X$, and then decays through $X \\to e^+\ne^-$. The $X$ boson mediates a fifth force with a characteristic range of 12 fm\nand has milli-charged couplings to up and down quarks and electrons, and a\nproton coupling that is suppressed relative to neutrons. The protophobic $X$\nboson may also alleviate the current 3.6$\\sigma$ discrepancy between the\npredicted and measured values of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment.\n", "  We present a study of magnetic field fluctuations, in a slow solar wind\nstream, close to ion scales, where an increase of the level of magnetic\ncompressibility is observed. Here, the nature of these compressive fluctuations\nis found to be characterized by coherent structures. Although previous studies\nhave shown that current sheets can be considered as the principal cause of\nintermittency at ion scales, here we show for the first time that, in the case\nof the slow solar wind, a large variety of coherent structures contributes to\nintermittency at proton scales, and current sheets are not the most common.\nSpecifically, we find compressive ($\\delta b_{\\|} \\gg \\delta b_{\\perp}$),\nlinearly polarized structures in the form of magnetic holes, solitons and shock\nwaves. Examples of Alfv\\'enic structures ($\\delta b_{\\perp} > \\delta b_{\\|}$)\nare identified as current sheets and vortex-like structures. Some of these\nvortices have $ \\delta b_{\\perp} \\gg \\delta b_{\\|}$, as in the case of Alfv\\'en\nvortices, but the majority of them are characterized by $\\delta b_{\\perp}\n\\gtrsim \\delta b_{\\|}$. Thanks to multi-point measurements by Cluster\nspacecraft, for about 100 structures, we could determine the normal, the\npropagation velocity and the spatial scale along this normal. Independently of\nthe nature of the structures, the normal is always perpendicular to the local\nmagnetic field, meaning that $k_{\\perp} \\gg k_{\\parallel}$. The spatial scales\nof the studied structures are found to be between 2 and 8 times the proton\ngyroradius. Most of them are simply convected by the wind, but 25\\% propagate\nin the plasma frame. Possible interpretations of the observed structures and\nthe connection with plasma heating are discussed.\n", "  The accuracy in determining the quantum state of a system depends on the type\nof measurement performed. Homodyne and heterodyne detection are the two main\nschemes in continuous-variable quantum information. The former leads to a\ndirect reconstruction of the Wigner function of the state, whereas the latter\nsamples its Husimi $Q$~function. We experimentally demonstrate that heterodyne\ndetection outperforms homodyne detection for almost all Gaussian states, the\ndetails of which depend on the squeezing strength and thermal noise.\n", "  The propeller effect should cut off accretion in fast-spinning neutron star\nhigh mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) at low mass transfer rates. However, accretion\ncontinues in some HMXBs at $L_{x} < 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, as evidenced by\ncontinuing pulsations. Indications of spectral softening in systems in the\npropeller regime suggest that some HMXBs are undergoing fundamental changes in\ntheir accretion regime. A 39 ks \\textit{XMM-Newton} observation of the\ntransient HMXB V0332+53 found it at a very low X-ray luminosity ($L_{x} \\sim\n4\\times 10^{32}$ erg s${^{-1}}$). A power-law spectral fit requires an\nunusually soft spectral index ($4.4^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$), while a magnetized neutron\nstar atmosphere model, with temperature \\lt\\ 6.7$\\pm 0.2$ K and inferred\nemitting radius of $\\sim0.2-0.3$ km, gives a good fit. We suggest that the\nquiescent X-ray emission from V0332+53 is mainly from a hot spot on the surface\nof the neutron star. We could not detect pulsations from V0332+53, due to the\nlow count rate. Due to the high $N_H$, thermal emission from the rest of the\nneutron star could be only weakly constrained, to \\lt\\\n$<$6.14$^{+0.05}_{-6.14}$ K, or $<3\\times10^{33}$ erg s${^{-1}}$.\n", "  We investigate models involving a vector-like quark X, which forms a 750 GeV\nbound state and reproduces the observed diphoton signals at the LHC, in\nconnection with other excesses in the LHC data. An exotic hypercharge of -4/3\nis required to fit the signal cross section, which indicates that there is\nadditional particle(s) that mediates the decay of X in the full theory. We find\nthat, introducing an SU(2) doublet vector-like quark of mass around 600 GeV in\nour UV-complete framework can accommodate not only the diphoton but also the\non-Z excess (and potentially a slight excess in the monojet events). Our models\nalso include a dark matter candidate. The most useful way to probe the models\nat the LHC is via monojet searches. The relic dark matter density is largely\ndetermined by coannihilation effects, and indirect detection of dark matter\nannihilation signals is the alternative and complementary probe of our models.\n", "  We present further results of a search for extragalactic submillimeter H2O\nmasers using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The\ndetection of a 321 GHz H2O maser in the nearby Type 2 Seyfert galaxy, the\nCircinus galaxy, has previously been reported, and here the spectral analysis\nof four other galaxies is described. We have discovered H2O maser emission at\n321 GHz toward the center of NGC 4945, a nearby Type 2 Seyfert. The maser\nemission shows Doppler-shifted velocity features with velocity ranges similar\nto those of the previously reported 22 GHz H2O masers, however the\nnon-contemporaneous observations also show differences in velocity offsets. The\nsub-parsec-scale distribution of the 22 GHz H2O masers revealed by earlier VLBI\n(Very Long Baseline Interferometry) observations suggests that the\nsubmillimeter masers could arise in an edge-on rotating disk. The maser\nfeatures remain unresolved by the synthesized beam of ~ 0.54 (~30 pc) and are\nlocated toward the 321 GHz continuum peak within errors. A marginally detected\n(3 sigma) high-velocity feature is redshifted by 579 km/s with respect to the\nsystemic velocity of the galaxy. Assuming that this feature is real and arises\nfrom a Keplerian rotating disk in this galaxy, it is located at a radius of\n~0.020 pc (~1.5 x 10^5 Schwarzschild radii), which would enable molecular\nmaterial closer to the central engine to be probed than the 22 GHz H2O masers.\nThis detection confirms that submillimeter H2O masers are a potential tracer of\nthe circumnuclear regions of active galaxies, which will benefit from higher\nangular resolution studies with ALMA.\n", "  We derive the complete expression of nonlocal damping in noncollinear\nmagnetization due to the nonuniform spin current pumped by precessional\nmagnetization and incorporate it into a generalized Thiele equation to study\nits effects on the dynamics of the transverse and vortex domain walls (DWs) in\nferromagnetic nanowires. We demonstrate that the transverse component of\nnonlocal damping slows down the field-driven DW propagation and increases the\nWalker breakdown field whereas it is neglected in many previous works in\nliterature. The experimentally measured DW mobility variation with the damping\ntuned by doping with heavy rare-earth elements that had discrepancy from\nmicromagnetic simulation are now well understood with the nonlocal damping. Our\nresults suggest that the nonlocal damping should be properly included as a\nprerequisite for quantitative studies of current-induced torques in\nnoncollinear magnetization.\n", "  In this work we study the role of disformal transformation on cosmological\nbackgrounds and its relation to the speed of sound for tensor modes. A speed\ndifferent from one for tensor modes can arise in several contexts, such as\nGalileons theories or massive gravity, nevertheless the speed is very\nconstrained to be one by observations of gravitational wave emission. It has\nbeen shown that in inflation a disformal trans- formation allows to set the\nspeed for tensor modes to one without making changes to the curvature power\nspectrum. Here we show that this invariance does not hold when considering the\nCMB anisotropy power spectrum. It turns out that the after doing the\ntransformation there is an imprint on the acoustic peaks and the diffusion\ndamping. This has interesting consequences; here we explore quartic galileon\ntheories which allow a modified speed for tensor modes. For these theories the\ntransformation can be used to constraint the parameter space in different\nregimes.\n", "  Recently it was shown in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 140402 (2014)] that in\nthe idealized Dicke model of superradiance there is no entanglement among any\npartitions of the system during the total evolution time of the system. This\nresult immediately conducts us to question if other measures from quantum\ninformation theory can explain the characteristic release of energy in a short\ntime interval. In this work we identify the uncertainty of purely quantum\norigin as the property responsible for Dicke superradiance. The quantum\nuncertainty on the population of each emitter of the sample captured by the\nWigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) is proportional to the correlation\nradiation rate, which is the part of the total radiated power coming from\ndipole correlations and responsible for releasing in a short time a great\nintensity of radiation energy. We also show that the correlation measure called\nlocal quantum uncertainty, which is the minimization of the WYSI over all local\nobservables, presents a double sudden change induced by environment. The time\nwindow between these two sudden changes is used to define the interval in which\nsymmetric global observables of the system behave classically for $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$, although the emitters remain strongly quantum correlated.\n", "  We explore when supernovae can (and cannot) regulate the star formation and\nbulge growth in galaxies based on a sample of 18 simulated galaxies. The\nsimulations include key physics such as evaporation and conduction, neglected\nin prior work, and required to correctly model superbubbles resulting from\nstellar feedback. We show that for galaxies with virial masses\n$>10^{12}\\;M_\\odot$, supernovae alone cannot prevent excessive star formation.\nThis failure occurs due to a shutdown of galactic winds, with wind mass\nloadings falling from $\\eta\\sim10$ to $\\eta<1$. In more massive systems, this\ntransfer of baryons to the circumgalactic medium falters earlier on and the\ngalaxies diverge significantly from observed galaxy scaling relations and\nmorphologies. The decreasing efficiency is simply due to a deepening potential\nwell preventing gas escape. This implies that non-supernova feedback mechanisms\nmust become dominant for galaxies with stellar masses greater than\n$\\sim4\\times10^{10}\\;M_\\odot$. The runaway growth of the central stellar bulge,\nstrongly linked to black hole growth, suggests that feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei is the probable mechanism. Below this mass, supernovae alone\nare able to produce a realistic stellar mass fraction, star formation history\nand disc morphology.\n", "  In this work we consider the influence of potential impurities deposited on\ntop of two-dimensional chiral superconductors. As discovered recently, magnetic\nimpurity lattices on an $s$-wave superconductor may give rise to a rich\ntopological phase diagram. We show that similar mechanism takes place in chiral\nsuperconductors decorated by non-magnetic impurities, thus avoiding the\ndelicate issue of magnetic ordering of adatoms. We illustrate the method by\npresenting the theory of potential impurity lattices embedded on chiral\n$p$-wave superconductors. While a prerequisite for the topological state\nengineering is a chiral superconductor, the proposed procedure results in\nvistas of nontrivial descendant phases with different Chern numbers.\n", "  It has been suggested that unresolved radio galaxies and radio quasars\n(sometimes referred to as misaligned active galactic nuclei) could be\nresponsible for a significant fraction of the observed diffuse gamma-ray\nbackground. In this study, we use the latest data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope to characterize the gamma-ray emission from a sample of 51\nradio galaxies. In addition to those sources that had previously been detected\nusing Fermi data, we report here the first statistically significant detection\nof gamma-ray emission from the radio galaxies 3C 212, 3C 411, and B3 0309+411B.\nCombining this information with the radio fluxes, radio luminosity function,\nand redshift distribution of this source class, we find that radio galaxies\ndominate the diffuse gamma-ray background, generating $77.2^{+25.4}_{-9.4}\\%$\nof this emission at energies above $\\sim$1 GeV. We discuss the implications of\nthis result and point out that it provides support for scenarios in which\nIceCube's high-energy astrophysical neutrinos also originate from the same\npopulation of radio galaxies.\n", "  The predictions for all the cosmological observables of any inflationary\nmodel depend on the number of e-foldings which is sensitive to the\npost-inflationary history of the universe. In string models the generic\npresence of light moduli leads to a late-time period of matter domination which\nlowers the required number of e-foldings and, in turn, modifies the exact\npredictions of any inflationary model. In this paper we compute exactly the\nshift of the number of e-foldings in Kaehler moduli inflation which is\ndetermined by the magnitude of the moduli initial displacement caused by vacuum\nmisalignment and the moduli decay rates. We find that the preferred number of\ne-foldings gets reduced from 50 to 45, causing a modification of the spectral\nindex at the percent level. Our results illustrate the importance of\nunderstanding the full post-inflationary evolution of the universe in order to\nderive precise predictions in string inflation. To perform this task it is\ncrucial to work in a setting where there is good control over moduli\nstabilisation.\n", "  We report on the first computation of the next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO) QCD corrections to $W^{\\pm}Z$ production in proton collisions. We\nconsider both the inclusive production of on-shell $W^{\\pm}Z$ pairs at LHC\nenergies and the total $W^{\\pm}Z$ rates including off-shell effects of the $W$\nand $Z$ bosons. In the off-shell computation, the invariant mass of the lepton\npairs from the $Z$ boson decay is required to be in a given mass window, and\nthe results are compared with the corresponding measurements obtained by the\nATLAS and CMS collaborations. The NNLO corrections range from 8% at\n$\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV to 11% at $\\sqrt{s}$=14 TeV and significantly improve the\nagreement with the LHC data at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 and 8 TeV.\n", "  We report temperature-dependent spin-Seebeck measurements on Pt/YIG bilayers\nand Pt/NiO/YIG trilayers, where YIG (Yttrium iron garnet, Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$)\nis an insulating ferrimagnet and NiO is an antiferromagnet at low temperatures.\nThe thickness of the NiO layer is varied from 0 to 10 nm. In the Pt/YIG\nbilayers, the temperature gradient applied to the YIG stimulates dynamic spin\ninjection into the Pt, which generates an inverse spin Hall voltage in the Pt.\nThe presence of a NiO layer dampens the spin injection exponentially with a\ndecay length of $2 \\pm 0.6$ nm at 180 K. The decay length increases with\ntemperature and shows a maximum of $5.5 \\pm 0.8$ nm at 360 K. The temperature\ndependence of the amplitude of the spin-Seebeck signal without NiO shows a\nbroad maximum of $6.5 \\pm 0.5$ $\\mu$V/K at 20 K. In the presence of NiO, the\nmaximum shifts sharply to higher temperatures, likely correlated to the\nincrease in decay length. This implies that NiO is most transparent to magnon\npropagation near the paramagnet-antiferromagnet transition. We do not see the\nenhancement in spin current driven into Pt reported in other papers when 1-2 nm\nNiO layers are sandwiched between Pt and YIG.\n", "  We develop a technique to find simultaneous measurements for noisy quantum\nobservables in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We use the method to derive\nlower bounds for the noise needed to make incompatible measurements jointly\nmeasurable. Using our strategy together with recent devel- opments in the field\nof one-sided quantum information processing we show that the attained lower\nbounds are tight for various symmetric sets of quantum measurements. We use\nthis characterisation to prove the existence of so called 4-Specker sets in the\nqubit case.\n", "  The HI and CO components of the interstellar medium (ISM) are usually used to\nderive the dynamical mass M_dyn of nearby galaxies. Both components become too\nfaint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In\nthose cases, the 158 $\\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to\nderive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the\ndetermination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions\nof HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,\nfor [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,\nHI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,\nTHINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]\nexponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much\nsteeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated\nspectrum (\"global profile\"), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of\nthe CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of\nintegrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the\nintrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the\n[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star\nforming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths\nagree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given\nISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we\nconclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on\n[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution. This length\nscale is similar to that of the optical disk.\n", "  We investigate the impact of spatial topology in 3+1 dimensional causal\ndynamical triangulations (CDT) by performing numerical simulations with\ntoroidal spatial topology instead of the previously used spherical topology. In\nthe case of spherical spatial topology we observed in the so-called phase C an\naverage spatial volume distribution n(t) which after a suitable time\nredefinition could be identified as the spatial volume distribution of the\nfour-sphere. Imposing toroidal spatial topology we find that the average\nspatial volume distribution n(t) is constant. By measuring the covariance\nmatrix of spatial volume fluctuations we determine the form of the effective\naction. The difference compared to the spherical case is that the effective\npotential has changed such that it allows a constant average n(t). This is what\nwe observe and this is what one would expect from a minisuperspace GR action\nwhere only the scale factor is kept as dynamical variable. Although no\nbackground geometry is put in by hand, the full quantum theory of CDT is also\nwith toroidal spatial toplogy able to identify a classical background geometry\naround which there are well defined quantum fluctuations.\n", "  We show that a multicolor modulation of the depth of an optical lattice\nallows for a flexible independent control of correlated hopping,\noccupation-dependent gauge fields, effective on-site interactions without\nFeshbach resonances, and nearest-neighbor interactions. As a result, the\nlattice-depth modulation opens the possibility of engineering with minimal\nexperimental complexity a broad class of lattice models in current experiments\nwith ultra-cold atoms, including Hubbard models with correlated hopping,\npeculiar extended models, and two-component anyon-Hubbard models.\n", "  The \"too big to fail\" problem is revisited by studying the tidal evolution of\npopulations of dwarf satellites with different density profiles. The high\nresolution cosmological $\\rm \\Lambda CDM$ \"ErisMod\" set of simulations is used.\nThese simulations can model both the stellar and dark matter components of the\nsatellites, and their evolution under the action of the tides of a MW-sized\nhost halo at a force resolution better than 10 pc. The stronger tidal mass loss\nand re-shaping of the mass distribution induced in satellites with $\\gamma=0.6$\ndark matter density distributions, as those resulting from the effect of\nfeedback in hydrodynamical simulations of dwarf galaxy formation, is sufficient\nto bring the circular velocity profiles in agreement with the kinematics of\nMW's dSphs. In contrast, in simulations in which the satellites retain cusps at\n$z=0$ there are several \"massive failures\" with circular velocities in excess\nof the observational constraints. Various sources of deviations in the\nconventionally adopted relation between the circular velocity at the half light\nradius and the one dimensional line-of-sight velocity dispersions are found.\nSuch deviations are caused by the response of circular velocity profiles to\ntidal effects, which also varies depending on the initially assumed inner\ndensity profile, and by the complexity of the stellar kinematics, which include\nresidual rotation and anisotropy. In addition tidal effects naturally induce\nlarge deviations in the stellar mass-halo mass relation for halo masses below\n$\\rm 10^9 ~ M_{\\odot}$, preventing any reliable application of the abundance\nmatching technique to dwarf galaxy satellites.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of massless scalar fields around a regular\nBardeen black hole, namely absorption cross section, scattering cross section\nand quasinormal modes. We compare the Bardeen and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black\nholes, showing limiting cases for which their properties are similar.\n", "  Saturn's moon Enceladus offers a unique opportunity in the search for life\nand habitable environments beyond Earth, a key theme of the National Research\nCouncil's 2013-2022 Decadal Survey. A plume of water vapor and ice spews from\nEnceladus's south polar region. Cassini data suggest that this plume, sourced\nby a liquid reservoir beneath the moon's icy crust, contain organics, salts,\nand water-rock interaction derivatives. Thus, the ingredients for life as we\nknow it-- liquid water, chemistry, and energy sources-- are available in\nEnceladus's subsurface ocean. We have only to sample the plumes to investigate\nthis hidden ocean environment. We present a New Frontiers class, solar-powered\nEnceladus orbiter that would take advantage of this opportunity, Testing the\nHabitability of Enceladus's Ocean (THEO). Developed by the 2015 Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory Planetary Science Summer School student participants under the\nguidance of TeamX, this mission concept includes remote sensing and in situ\nanalyses with a mass spectrometer, a sub-mm radiometer-spectrometer, a camera,\nand two magnetometers. These instruments were selected to address four key\nquestions for ascertaining the habitability of Enceladus's ocean within the\ncontext of the moon's geological activity: (1) How are the plumes and ocean\nconnected? (2) Are the abiotic conditions of the ocean suitable for\nhabitability? (3) How stable is the ocean environment? (4) Is there evidence of\nbiological processes? By taking advantage of the opportunity Enceladus's plumes\noffer, THEO represents a viable, solar-powered option for exploring a\npotentially habitable ocean world of the outer solar system.\n", "  Self-gravity and stellar feedback are capable of driving turbulence and\ntransporting mass and angular momentum in disk galaxies, but the balance\nbetween them is not well understood. In the previous paper in this series, we\nshowed that gravity alone can drive turbulence in galactic disks, regulate\ntheir Toomre $Q$ parameters to $\\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate\nsufficient to fuel star formation in the centers of present-day galaxies. In\nthis paper we extend our models to include the effects of star formation\nfeedback. We show that feedback suppresses galaxies' star formation rates by a\nfactor of $\\sim$ 5 and leads to the formation of a multi-phase atomic and\nmolecular ISM. Both the star formation rate and the phase balance produced in\nour simulations agree well with observations of nearby spirals. After our\ngalaxies reach steady state, we find that the inclusion of feedback actually\nlowers the gas velocity dispersion slightly compared to the case of pure\nself-gravity, and also slightly reduces the rate of inward mass transport.\nNevertheless, we find that, even with feedback included, our galactic disks\nself-regulate to $Q$ $\\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate sufficient\nto supply a substantial fraction of the inner disk star formation. We argue\nthat gravitational instability is therefore likely to be the dominant source of\nturbulence and transport in galactic disks, and that it is responsible for\nfueling star formation in the inner parts of galactic disks over cosmological\ntimes.\n", "  We construct an improved implementation for combining\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization and collinear factorization.\nTMD factorization is suitable for low transverse momentum physics, while\ncollinear factorization is suitable for high transverse momenta and for a cross\nsection integrated over transverse momentum. The result is a modified version\nof the standard $W+Y$ prescription traditionally used in the\nCollins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) formalism and related approaches. We further argue\nthat questions regarding the shape and $Q$-dependence of the cross sections at\nlower $Q$ are largely governed by the matching to the $Y$-term.\n", "  We present the numerical implementation of the time-dependent\ncomplete-active-space self-consistent-field (TD-CASSCF) method [Phys. Rev. A,\n88, 023402 (2013)] for atoms driven by a strong linearly polarized laser pulse.\nThe present implementation treats the problem in its full dimensionality and\nintroduces a gauge-invariant frozen-core approximation, an efficient evaluation\nof the Coulomb mean field scaling linearly with the number of basis functions,\nand a split-operator method specifically designed for stable propagation of\nstiff spatial derivative operators. We apply this method to high-harmonic\ngeneration in helium, beryllium, and neon and explore the role of electron\ncorrelations.\n", "  If at least one neutron star (NS) is magnetized in a binary NS merger, then\nthe orbital motion of the conducting companion during the final inspiral\ninduces a strong voltage and current along the magnetic field lines connecting\nthe NSs. If a modest fraction, eta, of the extracted electromagnetic power\nextracted accelerates relativistic particles, the resulting gamma-ray emission\na compact volume will result in the formation of an electron-positron pair\nfireball. Applying a steady-state pair wind model, we quantify the\ndetectability of the precursor fireball with gamma-ray satellites. For eta ~ 1\nthe gamma-ray detection horizon of D_max ~ 10(Bd/1e14 G)^{3/4} Mpc is much\ncloser than the Advanced LIGO/Virgo horizon of 200 Mpc, unless the NS surface\nmagnetic field strength is very large, Bd > 1e15 G. Given the quasi-isotropic\nnature of the emission, mergers with weaker NS fields could contribute a nearby\npopulation of short gamma-ray bursts. Power not dissipated close to the binary\nis carried to infinity along the open field lines by a large scale Poynting\nflux. Reconnection within this outflow, well outside of the pair photosphere,\nprovides a potential site for non-thermal emission, such as a coherent\nmillisecond radio burst.\n", "  The shapes of cluster central galaxies are not randomly oriented, but rather\nexhibit coherent alignments with the shapes of their parent clusters as well as\nwith the surrounding large-scale structures. In this work, we aim to identify\nthe galaxy and cluster quantities that most strongly predict the central galaxy\nalignment phenomenon among a large parameter space with a sample of 8237\nclusters and 94817 members within 0.1<z<0.35, based on the redMaPPer cluster\ncatalog constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We first quantify the\nalignment between the projected central galaxy shapes and the distribution of\nmember satellites, to understand what central galaxy and cluster properties\nmost strongly correlate with these alignments. Next, we investigate the angular\nsegregation of satellites with respect to their central galaxy major axis\ndirections, to identify the satellite properties that most strongly predict\ntheir angular segregation. We find that central galaxies are more aligned with\ntheir member galaxy distributions in clusters that are more elongated and have\nhigher richness, and for central galaxies with larger physical size, higher\nluminosity and centering probability, and redder color. Satellites with redder\ncolor, higher luminosity, located closer to the central galaxy, and with\nsmaller ellipticity show a stronger angular segregation toward their central\ngalaxy major axes. Finally, we provide physical explanations for some of the\nidentified correlations, and discuss the connection to theories of central\ngalaxy alignments, the impact of primordial alignments with tidal fields, and\nthe importance of anisotropic accretion.\n", "  In this paper, we study the formation and early evolution of a limb coronal\nmass ejection (CME) and its associated shock wave that occurred on 2014 January\n8. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) on board \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} disclose that the\nCME first appears as a bubble-like structure. Subsequently, its expansion forms\nthe CME and causes a quasi-circular EUV wave. Interestingly, both the CME and\nthe wave front are clearly visible at all of the AIA EUV passbands. Through a\ndetailed kinematical analysis, it is found that the expansion of the CME\nundergoes two phases: a first phase with a strong but transient lateral\nover-expansion followed by a second phase with a self-similar expansion. The\ntemporal evolution of the expansion velocity coincides very well with the\nvariation of the 25--50 keV hard X-ray flux of the associated flare, which\nindicates that magnetic reconnection most likely plays an important role in\ndriving the expansion. Moreover, we find that, when the velocity of the CME\nreaches $\\sim$600 km s$^{-1}$, the EUV wave starts to evolve into a shock wave,\nwhich is evidenced by the appearance of a type II radio burst. The shock's\nformation height is estimated to be $\\sim$0.2$R_{sun}$, which is much lower\nthan the height derived previously. Finally, we also study the thermal\nproperties of the CME and the EUV wave. We find that the plasma in the CME\nleading front and the wave front has a temperature of $\\sim$2 MK, while that in\nthe CME core region and the flare region has a much higher temperature of\n$\\ge$8 MK.\n", "  There is evidence in 21cm HI emission for voids several kpc in size centered\napproximately on the Galactic centre, both above and below the Galactic plane.\nThese appear to map the boundaries of the Galactic nuclear wind. An analysis of\nHI at the tangent points, where the distance to the gas can be estimated with\nreasonable accuracy, shows a sharp transition at Galactic radii $R\\lesssim 2.4$\nkpc from the extended neutral gas layer characteristic of much of the Galactic\ndisk, to a thin Gaussian layer with FWHM $\\sim 125$ pc. An anti-correlation\nbetween HI and $\\gamma$-ray emission at latitudes $10^{\\circ} \\leq |b| \\leq\n20^{\\circ}$ suggests that the boundary of the extended HI layer marks the walls\nof the Fermi Bubbles. With HI we are able to trace the edges of the voids from\n$|z| > 2$ kpc down to $z\\approx0$, where they have a radius $\\sim 2$ kpc. The\nextended HI layer likely results from star formation in the disk, which is\nlimited largely to $R \\gtrsim 3$ kpc, so the wind may be expanding into an area\nof relatively little HI. Because the HI kinematics can discriminate between gas\nin the Galactic center and foreground material, 21cm HI emission may be the\nbest probe of the extent of the nuclear wind near the Galactic plane.\n", "  Many previous studies have shown that magnetic fields as well as sunspot\nstructures present rapid and irreversible changes associated with solar flares.\nIn this paper we first use five X-class flares observed by SDO/HMI to show that\nnot only the magnetic fields and sunspot structures do show rapid, irreversible\nchanges but also these changes are closely related, both spatially and\ntemporally. The magnitudes of the correlation coefficients between the temporal\nvariations of horizontal magnetic field and sunspot intensity are all larger\nthan 0.90, with a maximum value of 0.99 and an average value of 0.96. Then\nusing four active regions in quiescent times, three observed and one simulated,\nwe show that in sunspot penumbra regions there also exists a close correlation\nbetween sunspot intensity and horizontal magnetic field strength, in addition\nto the well-known one between sunspot intensity and normal magnetic field\nstrength. Connecting these two observational phenomena, we show that the\nsunspot structure change and the magnetic field change are the two facets of\nthe same phenomena of solar flares, one change might be induced by the change\nof the other due to a linear correlation between sunspot intensity and magnetic\nfield strength out of a local force balance.\n", "  We study kaon-nucleon systems in the Skyrme model in a method based on the\nbound state approach of Callan-Klebanov but with the kaon around the physical\nnucleon of the rotating hedgehog. This corresponds to the variation after\nprojection, reversing the order of semiclassical quantization of $1/N_c$\nexpansion. The method, however, is considered to be suited to the study of\nweakly interacting kaon-nucleon systems including loosely $\\bar{K}N$ bound\nstates such as $\\Lambda(1405)$. We have found a bound state with binding energy\nof order ten MeV, consistent with the observed state. We also discuss the\n$\\bar{K}N$ interaction and find that it consists of an attraction in the middle\nrange and a repulsion in the short range.\n", "  We have previously calculated the intergalactic background light (IBL) as a\nfunction of redshift in the far ultraviolet to near infrared range, based\npurely on data from deep galaxy surveys. Here we utilize similar methods to\ndetermine the mid- and far infrared IBL out to a wavelength of 850 microns. Our\napproach enables us to constrain the range of photon densities, based on the\nuncertainties from observationally determined luminosity densities and colors.\nBy also including the effect of the 2.7 K cosmic background photons, we\ndetermine 68% confidence upper and lower limits on the opacity of the universe\nto gamma-rays up to PeV energies. Our direct results on the IBL are consistent\nwith those from complimentary gamma-ray analyses using observations from the\nFermi $\\gamma$-ray space telescope and the H.E.S.S. air Cherenkov telescope.\nThus, we find no evidence of previously suggested processes for the\nmodification of gamma-ray spectra other than that of absorption by pair\nproduction alone.\n", "  Cosmic ray electrons (CREs) are a crucial part of the ISM and are observed\nvia synchrotron emission. While much modelling has been carried out on the CRE\ndistribution and propagation of the Milky Way, little has been done on normal\nexternal star-forming galaxies. Recent spectral data from a new generation of\nradio telescopes enable us to find more robust estimations of the CRE\npropagation. We model the synchrotron spectral index of M 51 using the\ntime-dependent diffusion energy-loss equation and to compare the model results\nwith the observed spectral index determined from recent low-frequency\nobservations with LOFAR. This is the first time that this model for CRE\npropagation has been solved for a realistic distribution of CRE sources, which\nwe derive from the observed star formation rate, in an external galaxy. The\nradial variation of the synchrotron spectral index and scale-length produced by\nthe model are compared to recent LOFAR and older VLA observational data and\nalso to new observations of M 51 at 325MHz obtained with the GMRT. We find that\npropagation of CREs by diffusion alone is sufficient to reproduce the observed\nspectral index distribution in M 51. An isotropic diffusion coefficient with a\nvalue of $6.6\\pm0.2\\,\\times 10^{28}\\mathrm{cm}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is found to\nfit best and is similar to what is seen in the Milky Way. We estimate an escape\ntime of $11\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ from the central galaxy to $88\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ in the\nextended disk. It is found that an energy dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient is not important for CRE energies in the range\n$0.01\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$--$3\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. We are able to reproduce the\ndependence of the observed synchrotron scale-lengths on frequency, with $l\n\\propto \\nu^{-1/4}$ in the outer disk and $l \\propto \\nu^{-1/8}$ in the inner\ndisk.\n", "  We present the first wide area (19 deg$^2$), deep ($\\approx120-150$ {\\mu}Jy\nbeam$^{-1}$), high resolution ($5.6 \\times 7.4$ arcsec) LOFAR High Band Antenna\nimage of the Bo\\\"otes field made at 130-169 MHz. This image is at least an\norder of magnitude deeper and 3-5 times higher in angular resolution than\npreviously achieved for this field at low frequencies. The observations and\ndata reduction, which includes full direction-dependent calibration, are\ndescribed here. We present a radio source catalogue containing 6276 sources\ndetected over an area of $19$\\,deg$^2$, with a peak flux density threshold of\n$5\\sigma$. As the first thorough test of the facet calibration strategy,\nintroduced by van Weeren et al., we investigate the flux and positional\naccuracy of the catalogue. We present differential source counts that reach an\norder of magnitude deeper in flux density than previously achieved at these low\nfrequencies, and show flattening at 150 MHz flux densities below 10 mJy\nassociated with the rise of the low flux density star-forming galaxies and\nradio-quiet AGN.\n", "  The nature of period and amplitude changes in nonradial pulsators is\npresently unknown. It is therefore important to examine the correlations\nbetween these changes in stars with a large number of simultaneously excited\npulsation modes. However, the small amplitudes require extensive high-precision\nphotometry covering many years. We present 702 nights of high-precision\nphotometry of the evolved Delta Scuti variable 4 CVn obtained from 2005 - 2012\nwith a dedicated telescope. We detected 64 frequencies, of which 38 can be\nidentified as combinations and harmonics. The relative amplitudes of the\ncombination frequencies are similar to those found in 44 Tau and show no\nevidence for resonant mode coupling. Significant period and amplitude changes\nare detected for the dominant modes. The known prograde and retrograde modes\nshow period changes with opposite signs, while the radial mode exhibits only\nsmall, cyclical period changes. For each mode, the period changes are constant\nover the eight years and range from (1/P)dP/dt = -16 to +13 parts per million.\nOn the other hand, the amplitude variations show no systematic behavior between\ndifferent pulsation modes. The behavior of the prograde, axisymmetric, and\nretrograde modes indicates a constant decrease in the rotational splitting over\nthe eight years.\n", "  The Cosmicflows database of galaxy distances that in the 2nd edition\ncontained 8,188 entries is now expanded to 17,669 entries. The major additions\nare 2,257 distances that we have derived from the correlation between galaxy\nrotation and luminosity with photometry at 3.6 microns obtained with Spitzer\nSpace Telescope and 8,885 distances based on the Fundamental Plane methodology\nfrom the 6dFGS collaboration. There are minor augmentations to the Tip of the\nRed Giant Branch and Type Ia supernova compilations. A zero point calibration\nof the supernova luminosities give a value for the Hubble Constant of 76.2\n+-3.4(r) +-2.7(s) km/s/Mpc. Alternatively, a restriction on the peculiar\nvelocity monopole term representing global infall/outflow implies H_0 = 75 +-2\nkm/s/Mpc.\n", "  We explore the asymmetric sequential Landau-Zener (LZ) dynamics in an\nensemble of interacting Bose condensed two-level atoms coupled with a cavity\nfield. Assuming the couplings between all atoms and the cavity field are\nidentical, the interplay between atom-atom interaction and detuning may lead to\na series of LZ transitions. Unlike the conventional sequential LZ transitions,\nwhich are symmetric to the zero detuning, the LZ transitions of Bose condensed\natoms in a cavity field are asymmetric and sensitively depend on the photon\nnumber distribution of the cavity. In LZ processes involving single excitation\nnumbers, both the variance of the relative atom number and the step slope of\nthe sequential population ladder are asymmetric, and the asymmetry become more\nsignificant for smaller excitation numbers. Furthermore, in LZ processes\ninvolving multiple excitation numbers, there may appear asymmetric population\nladders with decreasing step heights. During a dynamical LZ process, due to the\natom-cavity coupling, the cavity field shows dynamical collapse and revivals.\nIn comparison with the symmetric LZ transitions in a classical field, the\nasymmetric LZ transitions in a cavity field originate from the\nphoton-number-dependent Rabi frequency. The asymmetric sequential LZ dynamics\nof Bose condensed atoms in a cavity field may open up a new way to explore the\nfundamental many-body physics in coupled atom-photon systems.\n", "  Several self-consistent models have been proposed, aiming at describing the\nphase space distribution of stars in globular clusters. This study explores the\nability of the recently proposed LIMEPY models (Gieles & Zocchi) to reproduce\nthe dynamical properties of direct N-body models of a cluster in a tidal field,\nduring its entire evolution. These dynamical models include prescriptions for\nthe truncation and the degree of radially-biased anisotropy contained in the\nsystem, allowing us to explore the interplay between the role of anisotropy and\ntides in various stages of the life of star clusters. We show that the amount\nof anisotropy in an initially tidally underfilling cluster increases in the\npre-collapse phase, and then decreases with time, due to the effect of the\nexternal tidal field on its spatial truncation. This is reflected in the\ncorrespondent model parameters, and the best-fit models reproduce the main\nproperties of the cluster at all stages of its evolution, except for the phases\nimmediately preceding and following core collapse. We also notice that the\nbest-fit LIMEPY models are significantly different from isotropic King models,\nespecially in the first part of the evolution of the cluster. Our results put\nlimits on the amount of radial anisotropy that can be expected for clusters\nevolving in a tidal field, which is important to understand other factors that\ncould give rise to similar observational signatures, such as the presence of an\nintermediate-mass black hole.\n", "  Blobs, or quasi-spherical emission regions containing relativistic particles\nand magnetic fields, are often assumed ad hoc in emission models of\nrelativistic astrophysical jets, yet their physical origin is still not well\nunderstood. Here, we employ a suite of large-scale two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations in electron-positron plasmas to demonstrate that\nrelativistic magnetic reconnection can naturally account for the formation of\nquasi-spherical plasmoids filled with high-energy particles and magnetic\nfields. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial\nscales, so we can capture the asymptotic physics independently of the initial\nsetup. We characterize the properties of the plasmoids that are continuously\ngenerated as a self-consistent by-product of the reconnection process: they are\nin rough energy equipartition between particles and magnetic fields; the upper\nenergy cutoff of the plasmoid particle spectrum is proportional to the plasmoid\nwidth w, corresponding to a Larmor radius ~0.2 w; the plasmoids grow in size at\n~0.1 of the speed of light, with most of the growth happening while they are\nstill non-relativistic (first they grow); their growth is suppressed once they\nget accelerated to relativistic speeds by the field line tension, up to the\nAlfven speed (then they go). The largest plasmoids, whose typical recurrence\ninterval is ~2.5 L/c, reach a characteristic size w ~ 0.2 L independently of\nthe system length L, they have nearly isotropic particle distributions and they\ncontain the highest energy particles, whose Larmor radius is ~0.03 L. The\nlatter can be regarded as the Hillas criterion for relativistic reconnection.\nWe briefly discuss the implications of our results for the high-energy emission\nfrom relativistic jets and pulsar winds.\n", "  Optical measurements and band structure calculations are reported on 3D Dirac\nmaterials. The electronic properties associated with the Dirac cone are\nidentified in the reflectivity spectra of Cd$_3$As$_2$ and Na$_3$Bi single\ncrystals. In Na$_3$Bi, the plasma edge is found to be strongly temperature\ndependent due to thermally excited free carriers in the Dirac cone. The thermal\nbehavior provides an estimate of the Fermi level $E_F=25$ meV and the z-axis\nFermi velocity $v_z = 0.3 \\text{ eV} \\AA$ associated with the heavy bismuth\nDirac band. At high energies above the $\\Gamma$-point Lifshitz gap energy, a\nfrequency and temperature independent $\\epsilon_2$ indicative of Dirac cone\ninterband transitions translates into an ab-plane Fermi velocity of $3 \\text{\neV} \\AA$. The observed number of IR phonons rules out the\n$\\text{P}6_3\\text{/mmc}$ space group symmetry but is consistent with the\n$\\text{P}\\bar{3}\\text{c}1$ candidate symmetry. A plasmaron excitation is\ndiscovered near the plasmon energy that persists over a broad range of\ntemperature. The optical signature of the large joint density of states arising\nfrom saddle points at $\\Gamma$ is strongly suppressed in Na$_3$Bi consistent\nwith band structure calculations that show the dipole transition matrix\nelements to be weak due to the very small s-orbital character of the Dirac\nbands. In Cd$_3$As$_2$, a distinctive peak in reflectivity due to the\nlogarithmic divergence in $\\epsilon_1$ expected at the onset of Dirac cone\ninterband transitions is identified. The center frequency of the peak shifts\nwith temperature quantitatively consistent with a linear dispersion and a\ncarrier density of $n=1.3\\times10^{17}\\text{ cm}^{-3}$. The peak width gives a\nmeasure of the Fermi velocity anisotropy of $10\\%$, indicating a nearly\nspherical Fermi surface. The lineshape gives an upper bound estimate of 7 meV\nfor the potential fluctuation energy scale.\n", "  It is at the heart of modern condensed matter physics to investigate the role\nof a topological structure in anomalous transport phenomena. In particular,\nchiral anomaly turns out to be the underlying mechanism for the negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistivity in a Weyl metal phase. Existence of a\ndissipationless current channel causes enhancement of electric currents along\nthe direction of a pair of Weyl points or applied magnetic fields ($B$).\nHowever, temperature ($T$) dependence of the negative longitudinal\nmagnetoresistivity has not been understood yet in the presence of disorder\nscattering since it is not clear at all how to introduce effects of disorder\nscattering into the \"topological-in-origin\" transport coefficient at finite\ntemperatures. The calculation based on the Kubo formula of the current-current\ncorrelation function is simply not known for this anomalous transport\ncoefficient. Combining the renormalization group analysis with the Boltzmann\ntransport theory to encode the chiral anomaly, we reveal how disorder\nscattering renormalizes the distance between a pair of Weyl points and such a\nrenormalization effect modifies the topological-in-origin transport coefficient\nat finite temperatures. As a result, we find breakdown of $B/T$ scaling, given\nby $B/T^{1 + \\eta}$ with $0 < \\eta < 1$. This breakdown may be regarded to be a\nfingerprint of the interplay between disorder scattering and topological\nstructure in a Weyl metal phase.\n", "  We study the dynamo generation (exponential growth) of large scale (planar\naveraged) fields in unstratified shearing box simulations of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). In contrast to previous studies restricted\nto horizontal ($x$-$y$) averaging, we demonstrate the presence of large scale\nfields when either horizontal or vertical ($y$-$z$) averaging is employed. By\ncomputing planar averaged fields and power spectra, we find large scale dynamo\naction in the early MRI growth phase---a previously unidentified feature. Fast\ngrowing horizontal low modes and fiducial vertical modes over a narrow range of\nwave numbers amplify these planar averaged fields in the MRI growth phase,\nbefore turbulence sets in. The large scale field growth requires linear\nfluctuations but not nonlinear turbulence (as defined by mode-mode coupling)\nand grows as a direct global mode of the MRI. Only by vertical averaging, can\nit be shown that the growth of horizontal low wavenumber MRI modes directly\nfeed-back to the initial vertical field providing a clue as to why the large\nscale vertical field sustains against turbulent diffusion in the saturation\nregime. We compute the terms in the planar averaged mean field equations to\nidentify the individual contributions to large scale field growth for both\nvertical and horizontal averaging. The large scale fields obtained from such\nvertical averaging are found to compare well with global cylindrical\nsimulations and quasilinear analytical analysis from a previous study by\nEbrahimi \\& Blackman. We discuss the potential implications of these new\nresults for understanding large scale MRI dynamo saturation and turbulence.\n", "  Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic) arise from the core-collapse of H (and He) poor\nstars, which could be either single WR stars or lower-mass stars stripped of\ntheir envelope by a companion. Their light curves are radioactively powered and\nusually show a fast rise to peak ($\\sim$10-15 d), without any early (first few\ndays) emission bumps (with the exception of broad-lined SNe Ic) as sometimes\nseen for other types of stripped-envelope SNe (e.g., Type IIb SN 1993J and Type\nIb SN 2008D). We have studied iPTF15dtg, a spectroscopically normal SN Ic with\nan early excess in the optical light curves followed by a long ($\\sim$30 d)\nrise to the main peak. It is the first spectroscopically-normal double-peaked\nSN Ic observed. We aim to determine the properties of this explosion and of its\nprogenitor star. Optical photometry and spectroscopy of iPTF15dtg was obtained\nwith multiple telescopes. The resulting light curves and spectral sequence are\nanalyzed and modelled with hydrodynamical and analytical models, with\nparticular focus on the early emission. Results. iPTF15dtg is a slow rising SN\nIc, similar to SN 2011bm. Hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric properties\nreveals a large ejecta mass ($\\sim$10 $M_{\\odot}$) and strong $^{56}$Ni mixing.\nThe luminous early emission can be reproduced if we account for the presence of\nan extended ($\\sim$500 R$_{\\odot}$), low-mass ($\\sim$0.045 M$_{\\odot}$)\nenvelope around the progenitor star. Alternative scenarios for the early peak,\nsuch as the interaction with a companion, a shock-breakout (SBO) cooling tail\nfrom the progenitor surface, or a magnetar-driven SBO are not favored. The\nlarge ejecta mass and the presence of H and He free extended material around\nthe star suggest that the progenitor of iPTF15dtg was a massive ($\\gtrsim$ 35\nM$_{\\odot}$) WR star suffering strong mass loss.\n", "  The magnetoelectric effects in multiferroics have a great potential in\ncreating next-generation memory devices. We conceive a new concept of\nnon-volatile memories based on a type of nonlinear magnetoelectric effects\nshowing a butterfly-shaped hysteresis loop. The principle is to utilize the\nstates of the magnetoelectric coefficient, instead of magnetization, electric\npolarization or resistance, to store binary information. Our experiments in a\ndevice made of the PMN-PT/Terfenol-D multiferroic heterostructure clearly\ndemonstrate that the sign of the magnetoelectric coefficient can be repeatedly\nswitched between positive and negative by applying electric fields, confirming\nthe feasibility of this principle. This kind of non-volatile memory has\noutstanding practical virtues such as simple structure, easy operations in\nwriting and reading, low power, fast speed, and diverse materials available.\n", "  Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) produce adverse space weather effects at\nEarth. Planets in the close habitable zone of magnetically active M dwarfs may\nexperience more extreme space weather than at Earth, including frequent CME\nimpacts leading to atmospheric erosion and leaving the surface exposed to\nextreme flare activity. Similar erosion may occur for hot Jupiters with close\norbits around solar-like stars. We have developed a model, Forecasting a CME's\nAltered Trajectory (ForeCAT), which predicts a CME's deflection. We adapt\nForeCAT to simulate CME deflections for the mid-type M dwarf V374 Peg and hot\nJupiters with solar-type hosts. V374 Peg's strong magnetic fields can trap CMEs\nat the M dwarfs's Astrospheric Current Sheet, the location of the minimum in\nthe background magnetic field. Solar-type CMEs behave similarly, but have much\nsmaller deflections and do not get trapped at the Astrospheric Current Sheet.\nThe probability of planetary impact decreases with increasing inclination of\nthe planetary orbit with respect to the Astrospheric Current Sheet - 0.5 to 5\nCME impacts per day for M dwarf exoplanets, 0.05 to 0.5 CME impacts per day for\nsolar-type hot Jupiters. We determine the minimum planetary magnetic field\nnecessary to shield a planet's atmosphere from the CME impacts. M dwarf\nexoplanets require values between tens and hundreds of Gauss. Hot Jupiters\naround a solar-type star, however, require a more reasonable <30 G. These\nvalues exceed the magnitude required to shield a planet from the stellar wind,\nsuggesting CMEs may be the key driver of atmospheric losses.\n", "  (abridged) We present 2-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the\nSmoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code, VINE, to model a self-gravitating\nbinary system similar to the GG Tau A system. We simulate systems configured\nwith semi-major axes of either $a=62$~AU (`wide') or $a=32$~AU (`close'), and\nwith eccentricity of either $e=0$ or $e=0.3$. Strong spiral structures are\ngenerated with large material streams extending inwards. A small fraction\naccretes onto the circumstellar disks, with most returning to the torus.\nStructures also propagate outwards, generating net outwards mass flow and\neventually losing coherence at large distances. The torus becomes significantly\neccentric in shape. Accretion onto the stars occurs at a rate of a few\n$\\times10^{-8}$\\msun/yr implying disk lifetimes shorter than $\\sim10^4$~yr,\nwithout replenishment. Only wide configurations retain disks by virtue of\nrobust accretion. In eccentric configurations, accretion is episodic, occurs\npreferentially onto the secondary at wrates peaked near binary periapse. We\nconclude that the \\ggtaua\\ torus is strongly self gravitating and that a major\ncontribution to its thermal energy is shock dissipation. We interpret its\nobserved features as manifestations of spiral structures and the low density\nmaterial surrounding it as an excretion disk created by outward mass flux. We\ninterpret GG Tau A as a coplanar system with an eccentric torus, and account\nfor its supposed mutual inclination as due to degeneracy between the\ninterpretation of inclination and eccentricity. Although the disks persist for\nlong enough to permit planet formation, the environment remains unfavorable due\nto high temperatures. We conclude that the GG Tau A system is in an eccentric,\n$a\\sim62$~AU orbit.\n", "  In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the C4.2\ncircular-ribbon flare in active region (AR) 12434 on 2015 October 16. The\nshort-lived flare was associated with positive magnetic polarities and a\nnegative polarity inside, as revealed by the photospheric line-of-sight\nmagnetograms. Such magnetic pattern is strongly indicative of a magnetic null\npoint and spine-fan configuration in the corona. The flare was triggered by the\neruption of a mini-filament residing in the AR, which produced the inner flare\nribbon (IFR) and the southern part of a closed circular flare ribbon (CFR).\nWhen the eruptive filament reached the null point, it triggered null point\nmagnetic reconnection with the ambient open field and generated the bright CFR\nand a blowout jet. Raster observations of the \\textit{Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph} (\\textit{IRIS}) show plasma upflow at speed of 35$-$120 km\ns$^{-1}$ in the Fe {\\sc xxi} 1354.09 {\\AA} line ($\\log T\\approx7.05$) and\ndownflow at speed of 10$-$60 km s$^{-1}$ in the Si {\\sc iv} 1393.77 {\\AA} line\n($\\log T\\approx4.8$) at certain locations of the CFR and IFR during the\nimpulsive phase of flare, indicating explosive chromospheric evaporation.\nCoincidence of the single HXR source at 12$-$25 keV with the IFR and\ncalculation based on the thick-target model suggest that the explosive\nevaporation was most probably driven by nonthermal electrons.\n", "  We present a class of modified-gravity theories which we call ultra-local\nmodels. We add a scalar field, with negligible kinetic terms, to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. We also introduce a conformal coupling to matter. This\ngives rise to a new screening mechanism which is not entirely due to the\nnon-linearity of the scalar field potential or the coupling function but to the\nabsence of the kinetic term. As a result this removes any fifth force between\nisolated objects in vacuum. The predictions of these models only depend on a\nsingle free function, as the potential and the coupling function are\ndegenerate, with an amplitude given by a parameter $\\alpha \\lesssim 10^{-6}$,\nwhose magnitude springs from requiring a small modification of Newton's\npotential astrophysically and cosmologically. This singles out a redshift\n$z_{\\alpha} \\sim \\alpha^{-1/3} \\gtrsim 100$ where the fifth force is the\ngreatest. The cosmological background follows the $\\Lambda$-CDM history within\na $10^{-6}$ accuracy, while cosmological perturbations are significantly\nenhanced (or damped) on small scales, $k \\gtrsim 2 h {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$.\nThe spherical collapse and the halo mass function are modified in the same\nmanner. We find that the modifications of gravity are greater for galactic or\nsub-galactic structures. We also present a thermodynamic analysis of the\nnon-linear and inhomogeneous fifth-force regime where we find that the Universe\nis not made more inhomogeneous before $z_\\alpha$ when the fifth force\ndominates, and does not lead to the existence of clumped matter on extra small\nscales inside halos for large masses while this possibility exists for masses\n$M\\lesssim 10^{11} M_\\odot$ where the phenomenology of ultra-local models would\nbe most different from $\\Lambda$-CDM.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the mass assembly history of ultramassive (Mstar\n> 10^11Msun) dense (Sigma = Mstar/(2*pi*Re^2) > 2500 Msun/pc^2) early-type\ngalaxies (ETGs) over the last 9 Gyr. We have traced the evolution of the number\ndensity rho of ultramassive dense ETGs and have compared their structural\n(effective radius Re and stellar mass Mstar) and dynamical (velocity dispersion\nsigma_e) parameters over the redshift range 0 < z < 1.6. We have derived the\nnumber density at 1.6 < z < 1 from the MUNICS and GOODS-South surveys, while we\nhave used the COSMOS and SDSS spectroscopic surveys to probe the intermediate\nand local redshift range. For the comparison of the dynamical and structural\nparameters, we have collected the ultramassive dense ETGs at 1.2 < z < 1.6 for\nwhich velocity dispersion measurements are available (11 ETGs). For 4 of them\nwe present unpublished estimates of sigma_e. We probe the intermediate redshift\nrange, and the local universe using the samples of ETGs by Saglia et al.\n(2010), Zahid et al. (2015), and by Thomas et al. (2010). We find that the\nnumber density of ultramassive dense ETGs evolves as rho(z) = K*(1 +\nz)^(0.3\\pm0.8) implying a decrease of ~ 25% of the population since z = 1.6. By\ncomparing the values of Re, Mstar, and sigma_e of ultramassive dense ETGs over\nthe range 0 < z < 1.6 we find that all the high-z ETGs have a counterpart in\nthe local universe. This implies either that the majority (~70%) of\nultramassive dense ETGs has already completed its assembly and its shaping at\n<z> = 1.4, or that, if a significant fraction of them evolves in size, new\nultramassive dense ETGs must form at z < 1.5 to maintain their number density\nalmost constant. The difficulty into identify good progenitors for these new\ndense ETGs at z < 1.5, and the stellar populations properties of local\nultramassive dense ETGs point toward the first hypothesis.\n", "  According to an article entitled Disproof of solar influence on the decay\nrates of 90Sr/90Y by Kossert and N\\\"ahle of the Physikalisch-Technische\nBundesanstalt (PTB) [1], the PTB measurements show no evidence of variability.\nWe show that, on the contrary, those measurements reveal strong evidence of\nvariability, including an oscillation at 11 year-1 that is suggestive of an\ninfluence of internal solar rotation. An analysis of radon beta-decay data\nacquired at the Geological Survey of Israel (GSI) Laboratory for the same time\ninterval yields strong confirmation of this oscillation.\n", "  Differentiating between active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and star\nformation in z ~ 2 galaxies is difficult because traditional methods, such as\nline ratio diagnostics, change with redshift while multi-wavelength methods\n(X-ray, radio, IR) are sensitive to only the brightest AGN. We have developed a\nnew method for spatially resolving emission lines in HST/WFC3 G141 grism\nspectra and quantifying AGN activity through the spatial gradient of the [O\nIII]/H$\\beta$ line ratio. Through detailed simulations, we show that our novel\nline-ratio gradient approach identifies ~ sim 40% more low-mass and obscured\nAGN than obtained by classical methods. Based on our simulations, we developed\na relationship that maps stellar mass, star formation rate, and measured [O\nIII]/H$\\beta$ gradient to AGN Eddington ratio. We apply our technique to\npreviously studied stacked samples of galaxies at z ~2 and find that our\nresults are consistent with these studies. Using this gradient method will also\nbe able to inform other galaxy evolution science, such as inside-out quenching\nand metallicity gradients, and will be widely applicable to future spatially\nresolved JWST data.\n", "  L1551 is chosen because it is relatively isolated in the Taurus molecular\ncloud shielded from FUV photons, providing an ideal environment for studying\nthe target properties. Our observations cover ~40'x40' with resolution ~30\",\nwhich are the maps with highest spatial dynamical range to date. We derive the\nX(13CO)/X(C18O) value on the sub-parsec scales in the range of ~3-27 with a\nmean value of 8.0+-2.8. Comparing to the visual extinction map derived from the\nHerschel observations, we found that the abundance ratio reaches its maximum at\nlow Av (i.e., Av ~ 1-4mag), and decreases to the typical solar system value of\n5.5 inside L1551 MC. The high X(13CO)/X(C18O) value at the boundary of the\ncloud is most likely due to the selective FUV photodissociation of C18O. This\nis in contrast with Orion-A where its internal OB stars keep the abundance\nratio at a high level greater than ~10. In addition, we explore the variation\nof the X-factor, because it is an uncertain but widely used quantity in\nextragalactic studies. We found that X-factor is proportional to N(H2)^1.0\nwhich is consistent with previous simulations. Excluding the high density\nregion, the average X-factor is similar to the Milky Way average value.\n", "  The simplest way to modify gravity is to extend the gravitational sector to\ninclude an additional scalar degree of freedom. The most general metric that\ncan be built in such a theory includes disformal terms, so that standard model\nfields move on a metric which is the sum of the space time metric and a tensor\nconstructed from first derivatives of the scalar. In such a theory\ngravitational waves and photons can propagate at different speeds, and these\ncan in turn be different from the maximum speed limit for matter particles. In\nthis work we show that disformal couplings can cause charged particles to emit\nCherenkov radiation and bremsstrahlung apparently in vacuum, depending on the\nbackground evolution of the scalar field. We discuss the implications of this\nfor observations of cosmic rays, and the constraints that arise for models of\ndark energy with disformal couplings.\n", "  We report the results of our observing campaign on GRB140903A, a nearby\n(z=0.351) short duration (T90~0.3 s) gamma-ray burst discovered by Swift. We\nmonitored the X-ray afterglow with Chandra up to 21 days after the burst, and\ndetected a steeper decay of the X-ray flux after approximately 1 day. Continued\nmonitoring at optical and radio wavelengths showed a similar decay in flux at\nnearly the same time, and we interpret it as evidence of a narrowly collimated\njet. By using the standard fireball model to describe the afterglow evolution,\nwe derive a jet opening angle of 5 deg and a collimation-corrected total energy\nrelease of 2E50 erg. We further discuss the nature of the GRB progenitor\nsystem. Three main lines disfavor a massive star progenitor: the properties of\nthe prompt gamma-ray emission, the age and low star-formation rate of the host\ngalaxy, and the lack of a bright supernova. We conclude that this event was\nlikely originated by a compact binary merger.\n", "  Inspired by the Standard Model of particle physics, we discuss a mechanism\nfor constructing chiral, anomaly-free gauge theories. The gauge symmetries and\nparticle content of such theories are identified using subgroups and complex\nrepresentations of simple anomaly-free Lie groups, such as $SO(10)$ or $E_6$.\nWe explore, using mostly $SO(10)$ and the $\\mathbf{16}$ representation, several\nof these \"imperfect copies\" of the Standard Model, including $U(1)^N$ theories,\n$SU(5)\\otimes U(1)$ theories, $SU(4)\\otimes U(1)^2$ theories with 4-plets and\n6-plets, and chiral $SU(3)\\otimes SU(2)\\otimes U(1)$. A few general properties\nof such theories are discussed, as well as how they might shed light on nonzero\nneutrino masses, the dark matter puzzle, and other phenomenologically relevant\nquestions.\n", "  The binding energy parameter $\\lambda$ plays a vital role in common envelope\nevolution. Though it is well known that $\\lambda$ takes different values for\nstars with different masses and varies during stellar evolution, it has been\nerroneously adopted as a constant in most of the population synthesis\ncalculations. We have systematically calculated the values of $\\lambda$ for\nstars of masses $1-60\\,M_{\\odot}$ by use of an updated stellar evolution code,\ntaking into account contribution from both gravitational energy and internal\nenergy to the binding energy of the envelope. We adopt the criterion for the\ncore-envelope boundary advocated by \\citet{Ivanova2011}. A new kind of\n$\\lambda$ with the enthalpy prescription is also investigated. We present\nfitting formulae for the calculated values of various kinds of $\\lambda$, which\ncan be used in future population synthesis studies.\n", "  Asteroseismology has proven to be an excellent tool to determine not only the\nglobal stellar properties with a good precision but also to infer stellar\nstructure, dynamics, and evolution for a large sample of Kepler stars. Prior to\nthe launch of the mission the properties of Kepler targets were inferred from\nbroadband photometry, leading to the Input Catalog (KIC Brown et al. 2011). The\nKIC was later revised in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog (Huber et al.\n2014), based on literature values and an asteroseismic analysis of stars which\nwere unclassified in the KIC. Here we present an asteroseismic analysis of\n45,400 stars which were classified as dwarfs in the Kepler Star Properties\nCatalog. We found that around 2% of the sample shows acoustic modes in the\ntypical frequency range that put them in the red-giant category rather than\ncool dwarfs. We analyse the asteroseismic properties of these stars, derive\ntheir surface gravities, masses, and radii and present updated effective\ntemperatures and distances. We show that the sample is significantly fainter\nthan the previously known oscillating giants in the Kepler field, with the\nfaintest stars reaching down to a Kepler magnitude, Kp~16. We demonstrate that\n404 stars are at distances beyond 5 kpc and that the stars are significantly\nless massive than for the original Kepler red-giant sample, consistent with a\npopulation of distant halo giants. A comparison with a galactic population\nmodel shows that up to 40 stars might be genuine halo giants, which would\nincrease the number of known asteroseismic halo stars by a factor of 4. The\ndetections presented here will provide a valuable sample for galactic\narcheology studies.\n", "  We explore the implications of the observed low spin of GW150914 within the\ncontext of stellar astrophysics and progenitor models. We conclude that many of\nthe recently proposed scenarios are in marked tension with this observation. We\nderive a simple model for the observed spin in the case that the progenitor\nsystem was a field binary composed of a black hole (BH) and a Wolf-Rayet star\nand explore the implications of the observed spin for this model. The spin\nobservation allows us to place a lower limit for the delay time between the\nformation of the BH+BH binary and the actual merger, $t_{\\textrm{merge}}$. We\nuse typical values for these systems to derive\n$t_{\\textrm{merge}}\\gtrsim10^{8}\\,\\textrm{yr}$, which proves to be an important\ndiagnostic for different progenitor models. We anticipate the next series of\nevents, and the associated spin parameters, will ultimately yield critical\nconstraints on formation scenarios and on stellar parameters describing the\nlate-stage evolution of massive stars.\n", "  The search of extragalactic regions with conspicuous presence of Wolf-Rayet\n(WR) stars outside the Local Group is challenging task due to the difficulties\nin detecting their faint spectral features. In this exploratory work, we\ndevelop a methodology to perform an automated search of WR signatures through a\npixel-by-pixel analysis of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data belonging to\nthe Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey, CALIFA. This technique\nallowed us to build the first catalogue of Wolf-Rayet rich regions with\nspatially-resolved information, allowing to study the properties of these\ncomplexes in a 2D context. The detection technique is based on the\nidentification of the blue WR bump (around He II 4686 {\\AA}, mainly associated\nto nitrogen-rich WR stars, WN) and the red WR bump (around C IV 5808 {\\AA} and\nassociated to carbon-rich WR stars, WC) using a pixel-by-pixel analysis. We\nidentified 44 WR-rich regions with blue bumps distributed in 25 galaxies of a\ntotal of 558. The red WR bump was identified only in 5 of those regions. We\nfound that the majority of the galaxies hosting WR populations in our sample\nare involved in some kind of interaction process. Half of the host galaxies\nshare some properties with gamma-ray burst (GRB) hosts where WR stars, as\npotential candidates to being the progenitors of GRBs, are found. We also\ncompared the WR properties derived from the CALIFA data with stellar population\nsynthesis models, and confirm that simple star models are generally not able to\nreproduce the observations. We conclude that other effects, such as the binary\nstar channel (which could extend the WR phase up to 10 Myr), fast rotation or\nother physical processes that causes the loss of observed Lyman continuum\nphotons, are very likely affecting the derived WR properties, and hence should\nbe considered when modelling the evolution of massive stars.\n", "  Classical correlation can be locked via quantum means--quantum data locking.\nWith a short secret key, one can lock an exponentially large amount of\ninformation, in order to make it inaccessible to unauthorized users without the\nkey. Quantum data locking presents a resource-efficient alternative to one-time\npad encryption which requires a key no shorter than the message. We report\nexperimental demonstrations of quantum data locking scheme originally proposed\nby DiVincenzo et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 067902 (2004)] and a loss-tolerant\nscheme developed by Fawzi, Hayde, and Sen [J. ACM. 60, 44 (2013)]. We observe\nthat the unlocked amount of information is larger than the key size in both\nexperiments, exhibiting strong violation of the incremental proportionality\nproperty of classical information theory. As an application example, we show\nthe successful transmission of a photo over a lossy channel with quantum data\n(un)locking and error correction.\n", "  China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is the first high-performance pulsed\nneutron source in China, which will meet the increasing fundamental research\nand technique applications demands domestically and overseas. A new distributed\ndata processing and analysis environment has been developed, which has generic\nfunctionalities for neutron scattering experiments. The environment consists of\nthree parts, an object-oriented data processing framework adopting a data\ncentered architecture, a communication and data caching system based on the C/S\nparadigm, and data analysis and visualization software providing the 2D/3D\nexperimental data display. This environment will be widely applied in CSNS for\nlive data processing.\n", "  We report an experimental demonstration of a local amplification of the spin\nHall voltage using an expanding depletion zone at a pn-junction in GaAs/AlGaAs\nHall-bar microdevices. It is demonstrated that the depletion zone can be\nspatially expanded by applying reverse bias by at least 10~$\\mu$m at low\ntemperature. In the depleted regime, the spin Hall signals reached more than\none order of magnitude higher values than in the normal regime at the same\nelectrical current flowing through the micro-device. It is shown that the\npn-bias has two distinct effects on the detected spin Hall signal. It controls\nthe local drift field at the Hall cross which is highly non-linear in the\npn-bias due to the shift of the depletion front. Simultaneously, it produces a\nchange in the spin-transport parameters due to the non-linear change in the\ncarrier density at the Hall cross with the pn-bias.\n", "  The charge-current-induced spin polarization is a key property of topological\ninsulators for their applications in spintronics. However, topological surface\nstates are expected to give rise to only one type of spin polarization for a\ngiven current direction, which has been a limiting factor for spin\nmanipulations. Here we report that in devices based on the bulk-insulating\ntopological insulator BiSbTeSe2, an unexpected switching of spin polarization\nwas observed upon changing the chemical potential. The spin polarization\nexpected from the topological surface states was detected in a heavily\nelectron-doped device, whereas the opposite polarization was reproducibly\nobserved in devices with low carrier densities. We propose that the latter type\nof spin polarization stems from topologically-trivial two-dimensional states\nwith a large Rashba spin splitting, which are caused by a strong band bending\nat the surface of BiSbTeSe2 beneath the ferromagnetic electrode used as a spin\ndetector. This finding paves the way for realizing the \"spin transistor\"\noperation in future topological spintronic devices.\n", "  The environmental aging effect of doped graphene is investigated as a\nfunction of the organic doping species, humidity, and the number of graphene\nlayers adjacent to the dopant by studies of the Raman spectroscopy, x-ray and\nultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, infrared\nspectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. It is found that higher\nhumidity and structural defects induce faster degradation in doped graphene.\nDetailed analysis of the spectroscopic data suggest that the physical origin of\nthe aging effect is associated with the continuing reaction of H2O molecules\nwith the hygroscopic organic dopants, which leads to formation of excess\nchemical bonds, reduction in the doped graphene carrier density, and\nproliferation of damages from the graphene grain boundaries. These\nenvironmental aging effects are further shown to be significantly mitigated by\nadded graphene layers.\n", "  Heavy quark parton distribution functions (PDFs) play an important role in\nseveral Standard Model and New Physics processes. Most PDF analyses rely on the\nassumption that the charm and bottom PDFs are generated perturbatively by gluon\nsplitting and do not include any non-perturbative degrees of freedom. However,\na non-perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark PDFs have been predicted in the\nliterature. We demonstrate that to a very good approximation the\nscale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the nucleon is governed\nby non-singlet evolution equations, and use this approximation to model the\nintrinsic bottom distribution and its impact on parton-parton luminosities at\nthe LHC.\n", "  One of the striking features of general relativity is that the Einstein\nequation is implied by the Clausius relation imposed on a small patch of\nlocally constructed causal horizon. Extension of this thermodynamic derivation\nof the field equation to more general theories of gravity has been attempted\nmany times in the last two decades. In particular, equations of motion for\nminimally coupled higher curvature theories of gravity, but without the\nderivatives of curvature, have previously been derived using a thermodynamic\nreasoning. In that derivation the horizon slices were endowed with an entropy\ndensity whose form resembles that of the Noether charge for diffeomorphisms,\nand was dubbed the Noetheresque entropy. In this paper, we propose a new\nentropy density, closely related to the Noetheresque form, such that the field\nequation of any diffeomorphism invariant metric theory of gravity can be\nderived by imposing the Clausius relation on a small patch of local causal\nhorizon.\n", "  A Corbino ring geometry is utilized to analyze edge and bulk conductance of\nInAs/GaSb quantum well structures. We show that edge conductance exists in the\ntrivial regime of this theoretically-predicted topological system with a\ntemperature insensitive linear resistivity per unit length in the range of 2\nkOhm/um. A resistor network model of the device is developed to decouple the\nedge conductance from the bulk conductance, providing a quantitative technique\nto further investigate the nature of this trivial edge conductance,\nconclusively identified here as being of n-type.\n", "  We survey the Si K edge structure in various absorbed Galactic low-mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) to study states of silicon in the inter- and circum-stellar\nmedium. The bulk of these LMXBs lie toward the Galactic bulge region and all\nhave column densities above $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The observations were\nperformed with the \\emph{Chandra} High Energy Transmission Grating\nSpectrometer. The Si K edge in all sources appears at an energy value of\n1844$\\pm$0.001 eV. The edge exhibits significant substructure which can be\ndescribed by a near edge absorption feature at 1849$\\pm$0.002 eV and a far edge\nabsorption feature at 1865$\\pm$0.002 eV. Both of these absorption features\nappear variable with equivalent widths up to several m\\AA. We can describe the\nedge structure with several components: multiple edge functions, near edge\nabsorption excesses from silicates in dust form, signatures from X-ray\nscattering optical depths, and a variable warm absorber from ionized atomic\nsilicon. The measured optical depths of the edges indicate much higher values\nthan expected from atomic silicon cross sections and ISM abundances, and appear\nconsistent with predictions from silicate X-ray absorption and scattering. A\ncomparison with models also indicates a preference for larger dust grain sizes.\nIn many cases we identify \\sixiii\\ resonance absorption and determine\nionization parameters between log $\\xi$ = 1.8 and 2.8 and turbulent velocities\nbetween 300 and 1000 \\kms. This places the warm absorber in close vicinity of\nthe X-ray binaries. In some data we observe a weak edge at 1.840 keV,\npotentially from a lesser contribution of neutral atomic silicon.\n", "  DC photoelectrical currents can be generated purely as a non-linear effect in\nuniform media lacking inversion symmetry without the need for a material\njunction or bias voltages to drive it, in what is termed photogalvanic effect.\nThese currents are strongly dependent on the polarization state of the\nradiation, as well as on topological properties of the underlying Fermi surface\nsuch as its Berry curvature. In order to study the intrinsic photogalvanic\nresponse of gapped graphene (GG), biased bilayer graphene (BBG), and hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN), we compute the non-linear current using a perturbative\nexpansion of the density matrix. This allows a microscopic description of the\nquadratic response to an electromagnetic field in these materials, which we\nanalyze as a function of temperature and electron density. We find that the\nintrinsic response is robust across these systems and allows for currents in\nthe range of pA cm/W to nA cm/W. At the independent-particle level, the\nresponse of hBN-based structures is significant only in the ultra-violet due to\ntheir sizeable band-gap. However, when Coulomb interactions are accounted for\nby explicit solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we find that the\nphotoconductivity is strongly modified by transitions involving exciton levels\nin the gap region, whose spectral weight dominates in the overall frequency\nrange. Biased bilayers and gapped monolayers of graphene have a strong\nphotoconductivity in the visible and infrared window, allowing for photocurrent\ndensities of several nA cm/W. We further show that the richer electronic\ndispersion of BBG at low energies and the ability to change its band-gap on\ndemand allows a higher tunability of the photocurrent, including not only its\nmagnitude but also, and significantly, its polarity.\n", "  We consider the finite interactions of the generalized Proca theory including\nthe sixth-order Lagrangian and derive the full linear perturbation equations of\nmotion on the flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker background in the\npresence of a matter perfect fluid. By construction, the propagating degrees of\nfreedom (besides the matter perfect fluid) are two transverse vector\nperturbations, one longitudinal scalar, and two tensor polarizations. The\nLagrangians associated with intrinsic vector modes neither affect the\nbackground equations of motion nor the second-order action of tensor\nperturbations, but they do give rise to non-trivial modifications to the\nno-ghost condition of vector perturbations and to the propagation speeds of\nvector and scalar perturbations. We derive the effective gravitational coupling\n$G_{\\rm eff}$ with matter density perturbations under a quasi-static\napproximation on scales deep inside the sound horizon. We find that the\nexistence of intrinsic vector modes allows a possibility for reducing $G_{\\rm\neff}$. In fact, within the parameter space, $G_{\\rm eff}$ can be even smaller\nthan the Newton gravitational constant $G$ at the late cosmological epoch, with\na peculiar phantom dark energy equation of state (without ghosts). The\nmodifications to the slip parameter $\\eta$ and the evolution of growth rate\n$f\\sigma_8$ are discussed as well. Thus, dark energy models in the framework of\ngeneralized Proca theories can be observationally distinguished from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model according to both cosmic growth and expansion history.\nFurthermore, we study the evolution of vector perturbations and show that\noutside the vector sound horizon the perturbations are nearly frozen and start\nto decay with oscillations after the horizon entry.\n", "  Based on the star formation histories (SFH) of galaxies in halos of different\nmasses, we develop an empirical model to grow galaxies in dark mattet halos.\nThis model has very few ingredients, any of which can be associated to\nobservational data and thus be efficiently assessed. By applying this model to\na very high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, we predict a number of\ngalaxy properties that are a very good match to relevant observational data.\nNamely, for both centrals and satellites, the galaxy stellar mass function\n(SMF) up to redshift $z\\simeq4$ and the conditional stellar mass functions\n(CSMF) in the local universe are in good agreement with observations. In\naddition, the 2-point correlation is well predicted in the different stellar\nmass ranges explored by our model. Furthermore, after applying stellar\npopulation synthesis models to our stellar composition as a function of\nredshift, we find that the luminosity functions in $^{0.1}u$, $^{0.1}g$,\n$^{0.1}r$, $^{0.1}i$ and $^{0.1}z$ bands agree quite well with the SDSS\nobservational results down to an absolute magnitude at about -17.0. The SDSS\nconditional luminosity functions (CLF) itself is predicted well. Finally, the\ncold gas is derived from the star formation rate (SFR) to predict the HI gas\nmass within each mock galaxy. We find a remarkably good match to observed\nHI-to-stellar mass ratios. These features ensure that such galaxy/gas catalogs\ncan be used to generate reliable mock redshift surveys.\n", "  We study the spherical evolution model for voids in $\\Lambda$CDM, where the\nevolution of voids is governed by dark energy at an earlier time than that for\nthe whole universe or in overdensities. We show that the presence of dark\nenergy suppresses the growth of peculiar velocities, causing void\nshell-crossing to occur at progressively later epochs as $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$\nincreases. We apply the spherical model to evolve the initial conditions of\nN-body simulated voids and compare the resulting final void profiles. We find\nthat the model is successful in tracking the evolution of voids with radii\ngreater than $30 h^{-1} \\rm Mpc$, implying that void profiles could be used to\nconstrain dark energy. We find that the initial peculiar velocities of voids\nplay a significant role in shaping their evolution. Excluding the peculiar\nvelocity in the evolution model delays the time of shell crossing.\n", "  We study a variant of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm [ E.\nFarhi, J. Goldstone, and S. Gutmann, arXiv:1411.4028] with slightly different\nparametrization and different objective: rather than looking for a state which\napproximately solves an optimization problem, our goal is to find a quantum\nalgorithm that, given an instance of MAX-2-SAT, will produce a state with high\noverlap with the optimal state. Using a machine learning approach, we chose a\n\"training set\" of instances and optimized the parameters to produce large\noverlap for the training set. We then tested these optimized parameters on a\nlarger instance set. As a training set, we used a subset of the hard instances\nstudied by E. Crosson, E. Farhi, C. Yen-Yu Lin, H.-H. Lin, and P. Shor (CFLLS)\n[arXiv:1401.7320]. When tested on the full set, the parameters that we find\nproduce significantly larger overlap than the optimized annealing times of\nCFLLS. Testing on other random instances from $20$ to $28$ bits continues to\nshow improvement over annealing, with the improvement being most notable on the\nhardest instances. Further tests on instances of MAX-3-SAT also showed\nimprovement on the hardest instances. This algorithm may be a possible\napplication for near-term quantum computers with limited coherence times.\n", "  [abridged] We report four years of radial velocity monitoring observations of\nSDSS J080531.84+481233.0 that reveal significant and periodic variability,\nconfirming the binary nature of the source. We infer an orbital period of\n2.02$\\pm$0.03 yr, a semi-major axis of 0.76$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ AU, and an\neccentricity of 0.46$\\pm$0.05, consistent with the amplitude of astrometric\nvariability and prior attempts to resolve the system. Folding in constraints\nbased on the spectral types of the components (L4$\\pm$0.7 and T5.5$\\pm$1.1),\ncorresponding effective temperatures, and brown dwarf evolutionary models, we\nfurther constrain the orbital inclination of this system to be nearly edge-on\n(90$^o\\pm$19$^o$), and deduce a large system mass ratio (M$_2$/M$_1$ =\n0.86$^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$), substellar components (M$_1$ =\n0.057$^{+0.016}_{-0.014}$ M$_{\\odot}$, M$_2$ = 0.048$^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$\nM$_{\\odot}$), and a relatively old system age (minimum age =\n4.0$^{+1.9}_{-1.2}$ Gyr). The measured projected rotational velocity of the\nprimary ($v\\sin{i}$ = 34.1$\\pm$0.7 km/s) implies that this inactive source is a\nrapid rotator (period $\\lesssim$ 3 hr) and a viable system for testing\nspin-orbit alignment in very-low-mass multiples. The combination of\nwell-determined component atmospheric properties and masses near and/or below\nthe hydrogen minimum mass make SDSS J0805+4812AB an important system for future\ntests of brown dwarf evolutionary models.\n", "  We report on two superoutbursts of the AM CVn-type object CR Boo in 2014\nApril--March and 2015 May--June. A precursor outburst acompanied both of these\nsuperoutbursts. During the rising branch of the main superoutburst in 2014, we\ndetected growing superhumps (stage A superhumps) whose period was\n$0.017669(24)$ d. Assuming that this period reflects the dynamical precession\nrate at the radius of the 3:1 resonance, we could estimate the mass ratio\n($q=M_2/M_1$) of 0.101(4) by using the stage A superhump period and the orbital\none of 0.0170290(6) d. This mass ratio is consistent with that expected by the\ntheoretical evolutionary model of AM CVn-type objects. The detection of\nprecursor outbursts and stage A superhumps is the second case in AM CVn-type\nobjects. There are two interpretations of the outbursts of AM CVn-type objects.\nOne is a dwarf nova (DN) outbursts analogy, which is caused by thermal and\ntidal instabilities. Another is the VY Scl-type variation, which is caused by\nthe variation of the mass-transfer rate of the secondary. This detection of the\nsuperhump variations strongly suggests the former interpretation.\n", "  The axion is a hypothetical particle considered to be the most economical\nsolution to the strong CP problem. It can also be formulated as a compelling\ncomponent of dark matter. The haloscope, a leading axion detection scheme,\nrelies on the conversion of galactic halo axions into real photons inside a\nresonant cavity structure in the presence of a static magnetic field, where the\ngenerated photon frequency corresponds to the mass of the axion. For maximum\nsensitivity it is key that the central frequency of the cavity mode structure\ncoincides with the frequency of the generated photon. As the mass of the axion\nis unknown, it is necessary to perform searches over a wide range of\nfrequencies. Currently there are substantial regions of the promising\npre-inflationary low mass axion range without any viable proposals for\nexperimental searches. We show that 3D resonant LC circuits with separated\nmagnetic and electric fields, commonly known as re-entrant cavities, can be\nsensitive dark matter haloscopes in this region, with frequencies inherently\nlower than those achievable in the equivalent size of empty resonant cavity. We\ncalculate the sensitivity and accessible axion mass range of these experiments,\ndesigning geometries to exploit and maximize the separated magnetic and\nelectric coupling of the axion to the cavity mode.\n", "  To evaluate the impact of stellar feedback, it is critical to estimate the\nmass outflow rates of galaxies. Past estimates have been plagued by uncertain\nassumptions about the outflow geometry, metallicity, and ionization fraction.\nHere we use Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of\nthe nearby starburst NGC 6090 to demonstrate that many of these quantities can\nbe constrained by the data. We use the Si~{\\sc IV} absorption lines to\ncalculate the scaling of velocity (v), covering fraction (C$_f$), and density\nwith distance from the starburst (r), assuming the Sobolev optical depth and a\nvelocity law of the form: v$~\\propto(1 -\\mathrm{R}_\\mathrm{i}/\\mathrm{r}\n)^\\beta$ (where R$_\\mathrm{i}$ is the inner outflow radius). We find that the\nvelocity ($\\beta$=0.43) is consistent with an outflow driven by an r$^{-2}$\nforce with the outflow radially accelerated, while the scaling of the covering\nfraction ($C_f \\propto \\mathrm{r}^{-0.82}$) suggests that cool clouds in the\noutflow are in pressure equilibrium with an adiabatically expanding medium. We\nuse the column densities of four weak metal lines and CLOUDY photoionization\nmodels to determine the outflow metallicity, the ionization correction, and the\ninitial density of the outflow. Combining these values with the profile\nfitting, we find R$_\\mathrm{i}$ = 63 pc, with most of the mass within 300~pc of\nthe starburst. Finally, we find that the maximum mass outflow rate is\n2.3~M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and the mass loading factor (outflow divided by the\nstar formation rate) is 0.09, a factor of 10 lower than the value calculated\nusing common assumptions for the geometry, metallicity and ionization structure\nof the outflow.\n", "  We use radiation hydrodynamic simulations to examine two models of solar\nflare chromospheric heating: Alfv\\'en wave dissipation and electron beam\ncollisional losses. Both mechanisms are capable of strong chromospheric\nheating, and we show that the distinctive atmospheric evolution in the\nmid-to-upper chromosphere results in Mg II k-line emission that should be\nobservably different between wave-heated and beam-heated simulations. We also\npresent Ca II 8542A profiles which are formed slightly deeper in the\nchromosphere. The Mg II k-line profiles from our wave-heated simulation are\nquite different from those from a beam-heated model and are more consistent\nwith IRIS observations. The predicted differences between the Ca II 8542A in\nthe two models are small. We conclude that careful observational and\ntheoretical study of lines formed in the mid-to-upper chromosphere holds\ngenuine promise for distinguishing between competing models for chromospheric\nheating in flares.\n", "  Spectropolarimetric observations of prominences have been obtained with the\nTHEMIS telescope during four years of coordinated campaigns. Our aim is now to\nunderstand the conditions of the cool plasma and magnetism in `atypical'\nprominences, namely when the measured inclination of the magnetic field\ndeparts, to some extent, from the predominantly horizontal field found in\n`typical' prominences. What is the role of the magnetic field in these\nprominence types? Are plasma dynamics more important in these cases than the\nmagnetic support? We focus our study on three types of `atypical' prominences\n(tornadoes, bubbles and jet-like prominence eruptions) that have all been\nobserved by THEMIS in the He I D_3 line, from which the Stokes parameters can\nbe derived. The magnetic field strength, inclination and azimuth in each pixel\nare obtained by using the Principal Component Analysis inversion method on a\nmodel of single scattering in the presence of the Hanle effect. The magnetic\nfield in tornadoes is found to be more or less horizontal, whereas for the\neruptive prominence it is mostly vertical. We estimate a tendency towards\nhigher values of magnetic field strength inside the bubbles than outside in the\nsurrounding prominence. In all of the models in our database, only one magnetic\nfield orientation is considered for each pixel. While sufficient for most of\nthe main prominence body, this assumption appears to be oversimplified in\natypical prominence structures. We should consider these observations as the\nresult of superposition of multiple magnetic fields, possibly even with a\nturbulent field component.\n", "  Recently, unresolved hard (20-40 keV) X-ray emission has been discovered\nwithin the central 10 pc of the Galaxy, possibly indicating a large population\nof intermediate polars (IPs). Chandra and XMM-Newton measurements in the\nsurrounding ~50 pc imply a much lighter population of IPs with $\\langle M_{\\rm\nWD} \\rangle \\approx 0.5 M_\\odot$. Here we use broad-band NuSTAR observations of\ntwo IPs: TV Columbae, which has a fairly typical but widely varying reported\nmass of $M_{\\rm WD} \\approx 0.5-1.0 M_\\odot$, and IGR J17303-0601, with a heavy\nreported mass of $M_{\\rm WD} \\approx 1.0-1.2 M_\\odot$. We investigate how\nvarying spectral models and observed energy ranges influence estimated white\ndwarf mass. Observations of the inner 10 pc can be accounted for by IPs with\n$\\langle M_{\\rm WD} \\rangle \\approx 0.9 M_\\odot$, consistent with that of the\nCV population in general, and the X-ray observed field IPs in particular. The\nlower mass derived by Chandra and XMM-Newton appears to be an artifact of\nnarrow energy band fitting. To explain the (unresolved) CHXE by IPs requires an\nX-ray (2-8 keV) luminosity function (XLF) extending down to at least\n$5\\times10^{31}$ erg/s. The CHXE XLF, if extended to the surrounding ~50 pc\nobserved by Chandra and XMM-Newton, requires at least ~20-40% of the $\\sim$9000\npoint sources are IPs. If the XLF extends just a factor of a few lower in\nluminosity, then the vast majority of these sources are IPs. This is in\ncontrast to recent observations of the Galactic ridge, where the bulk of the\n2-8 keV emission is ascribed to dwarf novae.\n", "  Phosphorus is a crucial element in biochemistry, especially the P-O bond,\nwhich is key for the formation of the backbone of the deoxyribonucleic acid. So\nfar, PO has only been detected towards the envelope of evolved stars, and never\ntowards star-forming regions. We report the first detections of PO towards two\nmassive star-forming regions, W51 e1/e2 and W3(OH), using data from the IRAM\n30m telescope. PN has also been detected towards the two regions. The abundance\nratio PO/PN is 1.8 and 3 for W51 and W3(OH), respectively. Our chemical model\nindicates that the two molecules are chemically related and are formed via\ngas-phase ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions during the cold collapse.\nThe molecules freeze out onto grains at the end of the collapse and desorb\nduring the warm-up phase once the temperature reaches 35 K. Similar abundances\nof the two species are expected during a period of 5x10^{4} yr at the early\nstages of the warm-up phase, when the temperature is in the range 35-90 K. The\nobserved molecular abundances of 10^{-10} are predicted by the model if a\nrelatively high initial abundance of 5x10^{-9} of depleted phosphorus is\nassumed.\n", "  We report on the discovery of mHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from the\nhigh mass X-ray binary (HMXB) IGRJ19140+0951, during a 40 ks XMM-Newton\nobservation performed in 201 5, which caught the source in its faintest state\never observed. At the start of the observation, IGRJ19140+0951 was at a low\nflux of 2$\\times$10$^{-12}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ ( 2-10 keV; L$_{\\rm\nX}$=3$\\times$10$^{33}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ at 3.6 kpc), then its emission rised\nreaching a flux 10 times higher, in a flare-like activity. The investigation of\nthe pow er spectrum reveals the presence of QPOs, detected only in the second\npart of the observation, with a strong peak at a frequency of\n1.46$\\pm{0.07}$~mHz, together with higher harm onics. The X-ray spectrum is\nhighly absorbed (N$_{\\rm H}$=$10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$), well fitted by a power-law\nwith a photon index in the range 1.2-1.8. The re-analysis of a Chandra archival\nobservation shows a modulation at 0.17+/-0.05mHz, very likely the neutron star\nspin period (although a QPO cannot be excluded). We discuss the origin of the\n1.46 mHz QPO in the framework of both disc-fed and wind-fed HMXBs, favouring\nthe quasi-spherical accretion scenario. The low flux observed by XMM-Newton\nleads to about three orders of magnit ude the source dynamic range, overlapping\nwith the one observed from Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). However,\nsince its duty cycle is not as low as in SFXTs, IGRJ19140 +0951 is an\nintermediate system between persistent supergiant HMXBs and SFXTs, suggesting a\nsmooth transition between these two sub-classes.\n", "  Warm inflation is, as of today, one of the best motivated mechanisms for\nexplaining an early inflationary period. In this paper, we derive and analyze\nthe current bounds on warm inflation with a monomial potential $U\\propto\n\\phi^p$, using the constraints from the PLANCK mission. In particular, we\ndiscuss the parameter space of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the potential\ncoupling $\\lambda$ of the monomial warm inflation in terms of the number of\ne-folds. We obtain that the theoretical tensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\sim 10^{-8}$\nis much smaller than the current observational constrain $r \\lesssim 0.12$,\ndespite a relatively large value of the field excursion $\\Delta \\phi \\sim\n0.1\\MP$. Warm inflation thus eludes the Lyth bound set on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio by the field excursion.\n", "  Claude Shannon proved in 1949 that information-theoretic-secure encryption is\npossible if the encryption key is used only once, is random, and is at least as\nlong as the message itself. Notwithstanding, when information is encoded in a\nquantum system, the phenomenon of quantum data locking allows one to encrypt a\nmessage with a shorter key and still provide information-theoretic security. We\npresent one of the first feasible experimental demonstrations of quantum data\nlocking for direct communication and propose a scheme for a quantum enigma\nmachine that encrypts 6 bits per photon (containing messages, new encryption\nkeys, and forward error correction bits) with less than 6 bits per photon of\nencryption key while remaining information-theoretically secure.\n", "  We report the detection, using observations of the CO(2-1) line performed\nwith the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), of molecular gas in the region\nof the outer filament of Centaurus A, a complex region known to show various\nsignatures of an interaction between the radio jet, an HI cloud, and ionised\ngas filaments. We detect CO(2-1) at all observed locations, which were selected\nto represent regions with very different physical conditions. The H_2 masses of\nthe detections range between 0.2 x 10^6 and 1.1 x 10^6 \\msun, for conservative\nchoices of the CO to H_2 conversion factor. Surprisingly, the stronger\ndetections are not coincident with the HI cloud, but instead are in the region\nof the ionised filaments. We also find variations in the widths of the CO(2-1)\nlines throughout the region, with broader lines in the region of the ionised\ngas, i.e. where the jet--cloud interaction is strongest, and with narrow\nprofiles in the HI cloud. This may indicate that the molecular gas in the\nregion of the ionised gas has the momentum of the jet-cloud interaction encoded\nin it, in the same way as the ionised gas does. These molecular clouds may\ntherefore be the result of very efficient cooling of the down-stream gas photo-\nor shock-ionised by the interaction. On the other hand, the molecular clouds\nwith narrower profiles, which are closer to or inside the HI cloud, could be\npre-existing cold H_2 cores which manage to survive the effects of the passing\njet.\n", "  Aims. To make a detailed study of the nulling and subpulse drifting in PSR\nJ1727$-$2739 for investigation of its radiation properties. Methods. The\nobservations were carried out on 20 March, 2004 using the Parkes 64-m radio\ntelescope, with a central frequency of 1518 MHz. A total of 5568 single pulses\nwere analysed. Results. This pulsar shows well defined nulls with lengths\nlasting from 6 to 281 pulses and separated by burst phases ranging from 2 to\n133 pulses. We estimate a nulling fraction of around 68\\%. No emission in the\naverage pulse profile integrated over all null pulses is detected with\nsignificance above $3\\sigma$. Most transitions from nulls to bursts are within\na few pulses, whereas the transitions from bursts to nulls exhibit two patterns\nof decay: decrease gradually or rapidly. In the burst phase, we find that there\nare two distinct subpulse drift modes with vertical spacing between the drift\nbands of $9.7 \\pm 1.6$ and $5.2 \\pm 0.9$ pulse periods, while sometimes there\nis a third mode with no subpulse drifting. Some mode transitions occur within a\nsingle burst, while others are separated by nulls. Different modes have\ndifferent average pulse profiles. Possible physical mechanisms are discussed.\n", "  A simple estimate is given of gravitational wave memory for the inspiral and\nmerger of a binary black hole system. Here the memory is proportional to the\ntotal energy radiated and has a simple angular dependence. This estimate might\nbe helpful as a consistency check for numerical relativity memory waveforms.\n", "  The well-studied carbon star, V Hya, showing evidence for high-speed,\ncollimated outflows and dense equatorial structures, is a key object in the\nstudy of the poorly understood transition of AGB stars into aspherical\nplanetary nebulae. Using the STIS instrument onboard HST, we have obtained high\nspatial-resolution long-slit optical spectra of V Hya that show high-velocity\nemission in [SII] and [FeII] lines. Our dataset, spanning three epochs spaced\napart by a year during each of two periods (in 2002-2004 and 2011-2013), shows\nthat V Hya ejects high-speed (about 200-250 km/s) bullets once every ~8.5 yr.\nThe ejection axis flip-flops around a roughly eastern direction, both in and\nperpendicular to the sky-plane, and the radial velocities of the ejecta also\nvary in concert between low and high values. We propose a model in which the\nbullet ejection is associated with the periastron passage of a binary companion\nin an eccentric orbit around V Hya with an orbital period of ~8.5 yr. The\nflip-flop phenomenon is likely the result of collimated ejection from an\naccretion disk (produced by gravitational capture of material from the primary)\nthat is warped and precessing, and/or that has a magnetic field that is\nmisaligned with that of the companion or the primary star. We show how a\npreviously observed 17-year period in V Hya's light-cycle can also be explained\nin our model. Additionally, we describe how the model proposed here can be\nextended to account for multipolar nebulae.\n", "  We have carried out two sets of observations to quantify the properties of\nSiO gas in the unusual HD 172555 debris disk: (1) a search for the J=8-7\nrotational transition from the vibrational ground state, carried out with the\nAPEX sub-millimeter telescope and heterodyne receiver at 863 microns, and (2) a\nsearch at 8.3 microns for the P(17) ro-vibrational transition of gas phase SiO,\ncarried out with VLT/VISIR with a resolution, $\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda$, of\n30000. The APEX measurement resulted in a 3 $\\sigma$ non-detection of an\ninterstellar feature, but only an upper limit to emission at the radial\nvelocity and linewidth expected from HD 172555. The VLT/VISIR result was also\nan upper limit. These were used to provide limits for the abundance of gas\nphase SiO, for a range of temperatures. The upper limit from our APEX\ndetection, assuming an 8000 K primary star photospheric excitation, falls more\nthan an order of magnitude below the self-shielding stability threshold derived\nby Johnson et al. (2012). Our results thus favor a solid-state origin for the\n8.3 micron feature seen in the Spitzer IRS spectrum of the circumstellar excess\nemission, and the production of circumstellar O$^+$ and Si$^+$ by SiO UV\nphotolysis. The implications of these estimates are explored in the framework\nof models of the HD 172555 circumstellar disk.\n", "  We propose a method to achieve high degree control of nanomechanical\noscillators by coupling their mechanical motion to single spins. By\nmanipulating the spin alone and measuring its quantum state heralds the cooling\nor squeezing of the oscillator even for weak spin-oscillator couplings. We\nanalytically show that the asymptotic behavior of the oscillator is determined\nby a spin-induced thermal filter function whose overlap with the initial\nthermal distribution of the oscillator determines its cooling, heating or\nsqueezing. Counterintuitively, the rate of cooling dependence on the\ninstantaneous thermal occupancy of the oscillator renders robust cooling or\nsqueezing even for high initial temperatures and damping rates. We further\nestimate how the proposed scheme can be used to control the motion of a thin\ndiamond cantilever by coupling it to its defect centers at low temperature.\n", "  We reproduce the distribution of the longitudinal and transverse components\nof momenta of charged hadrons stemming from jets created in proton-proton\ncollisions at s^1/2 = 7 TeV by a statistical fragmentation model. Our\nhadronization model is based on microcanonical statistics and negative binomial\nmultiplicity fluctuations. We describe the scale dependence of the fit\nparameters of the model with formulas obtained by approximating the exact\nsolution of the DGLAP equation in the phi^3 theory with leading order splitting\nfunction and 1-loop coupling.\n", "  The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) has recently attracted\nconsiderable interest owing to its fundamental role in the stabilization of\nchiral spin textures in ultrathin ferromagnets, which are interesting\ncandidates for future spintronic technologies. Here we employ a scanning\nnano-magnetometer based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond to\nlocally probe the strength of the interfacial DMI in CoFeB/MgO ultrathin films\ngrown on different heavy metal underlayers X=Ta,TaN, and W. By measuring the\nstray field emanating from DWs in micron-long wires of such materials, we\nobserve deviations from the Bloch profile for TaN and W underlayers that are\nconsistent with a positive DMI value favoring right-handed chiral spin\nstructures. Moreover, our measurements suggest that the DMI constant might vary\nlocally within a single sample, illustrating the importance of local probes for\nthe study of magnetic order at the nanoscale.\n", "  We present multi-epoch astrometric radio observations with the Very Long\nBaseline Array (VLBA) of the young ultracool-dwarf binary LSPM J1314+1320AB .\nThe radio emission comes from the secondary star. Combining the VLBA data with\nKeck near-infrared adaptive-optics observations of both components, a full\nastrometric fit of parallax ($\\pi_{\\rm abs}=57.975\\pm0.045$ mas, corresponding\nto a distance of $d=17.249\\pm0.013$ pc), proper motion ($\\mu_{\\rm \\alpha cos\n\\delta}=-247.99\\pm0.10$ mas yr$^{-1}$, $\\mu_{\\delta}=-183.58\\pm0.22$ mas\nyr$^{-1}$), and orbital motion is obtained. Despite the fact that the two\ncomponents have nearly identical masses to within $\\pm2$%, the secondary's\nradio emission exceeds that of the primary by a factor of $\\gtrsim$30,\nsuggesting a difference in stellar rotation history, which could result in\ndifferent magnetic field configurations. Alternatively, the emission could be\nanisotropic and beamed toward us for the secondary but not for the primary.\nUsing only reflex motion, we exclude planets of mass 0.7 to 10 $M_{\\rm jup}$\nwith orbital periods of 600 to 10 days, respectively. Additionally, we use the\nfull orbital solution of the binary to derive an upper limit for the semi-major\naxis of 0.23 AU for stable planetary orbits within this system. These limits\ncover a parameter space that is inaccessible with, and complementary to,\nnear-infrared radial velocity surveys of ultracool dwarfs. Our absolute\nastrometry will constitute an important test for the astrometric calibration of\nGaia.\n", "  We present novel tests of pre$-$main-sequence models based on individual\ndynamical masses for the M7 binary LSPM J1314+1320AB. Joint analysis of our\nKeck adaptive optics astrometric monitoring along with Very Long Baseline Array\nradio data from a companion paper yield component masses of $0.0885\\pm0.0006$\n$M_{\\odot}$ and $0.0875\\pm0.0010$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a parallactic distance of\n$17.249\\pm0.013$ pc. We also derive component luminosities that are consistent\nwith the system being coeval at an age of $80.8\\pm2.5$ Myr, according to BHAC15\nevolutionary models. The presence of lithium is consistent with model\npredictions, marking the first time the theoretical lithium depletion boundary\nhas been tested with ultracool dwarfs of known mass. However, we find that the\naverage evolutionary model-derived effective temperature ($2950\\pm5$ K) is 180\nK hotter than we derive from a spectral type$-$$T_{\\rm eff}$ relation based on\nBT-Settl models ($2770\\pm100$ K). We suggest that the dominant source of this\ndiscrepancy is model radii being too small by $\\approx$13%. In a test that\nmimics the typical application of evolutionary models by observers, we derive\nmasses on the H-R diagram using the luminosity and BT-Settl temperature. The\nestimated masses are $46^{+16}_{-19}$% (2.0$\\sigma$) lower than we measure\ndynamically and would imply that this is a system of $\\approx$50 $M_{\\rm Jup}$\nbrown dwarfs, highlighting the large systematic errors possible when inferring\nmasses from the H-R diagram. This is first time masses have been measured for\nultracool ($\\geq$M6) dwarfs displaying spectral signatures of low gravity.\nBased on features in the infrared, LSPM J1314+1320AB appears higher gravity\nthan typical Pleiades and AB Dor members, opposite the expectation given its\nyounger age. The components of LSPM J1314+1320AB are now the nearest, lowest\nmass pre$-$main-sequence stars with direct mass measurements.\n", "  We present a combined analysis of rest-frame far-UV (1000-2000 A) and\nrest-frame optical (3600-7000 A) composite spectra formed from very deep\nobservations of a sample of 30 star-forming galaxies with z=2.4+/-0.1, selected\nto be representative of the full KBSS-MOSFIRE spectroscopic survey. Since the\nsame massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and the\nexcitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar\npopulation synthesis model must simultaneously match the details of the far-UV\nstellar+nebular continuum and-- when inserted as the excitation source in\nphotoionization models-- account for all observed nebular emission line ratios.\nWe find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar\nmetallicity (Z_*/Z_{sun} ~ 0.1) but relatively high ionized gas-phase oxygen\nabundances (Z_{neb}/Z_{sun} ~ 0.5), can successfully match all of the\nobservational constraints. We argue that this apparent discrepancy is naturally\nexplained by highly super-solar O/Fe [4-5 times (O/Fe)_{sun}], expected for gas\nwhose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. Once\nthe correct ionizing spectrum is identified, photoionization models reproduce\nall of the observed strong emission line ratios, the direct T_e measurement of\nO/H, and allow accurate measurement of the gas-phase abundance ratios of N/O\nand C/O -- both of which are significantly sub-solar but, as for O/Fe, are in\nremarkable agreement with abundance patterns observed in Galactic thick disk,\nbulge, and halo stars with similar O/H. High nebular excitation is the rule at\nhigh-z (and rare at low-z) because of systematically shorter enrichment\ntimescales (<<1 Gyr): low Fe/O environments produce harder (and longer-lived)\nstellar EUV spectra at a given O/H, enhanced by dramatic effects on the\nevolution of massive star binaries.\n", "  We study the real-space entanglement renormalization group flows of\ntopological band insulators in (2+1) dimensions by using the continuum\nmulti-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (cMERA). Given the ground state\nof a Chern insulator, we construct and study its cMERA by paying attention, in\nparticular, to how the bulk holographic geometry and the Berry curvature depend\non the topological properties of the ground state. It is found that each state\ndefined at different energy scale of cMERA carries a nonzero Berry flux, which\nis emanated from the UV layer of cMERA, and flows towards the IR. Hence, a\ntopologically nontrivial UV state flows under the RG to an IR state, which is\nalso topologically nontrivial. On the other hand, we found that there is an\nobstruction to construct the exact ground state of a topological insulator with\na topologically trivial IR state. I.e., if we try to construct a cMERA for the\nground state of a Chern insulator by taking a topologically trivial IR state,\nthe resulting cMERA does not faithfully reproduce the exact ground state at all\nlength scales.\n", "  We develop a mathematical construction of non-Gaussian fields whose bispectra\nsatisfy the single-clock inflation consistency relation. At the same order that\nour basis for bispectra recovers the two simplest single clock templates, we\nalso find a third orthogonal template which has the single clock squeezed\nlimit, peaks in folded configurations, and has very small coupling in the\nequilateral limit. We explore the map between templates and operators in a very\ngeneral Lagrangian for single-clock fluctuations and find no significant\noverlap between the new template and models in the literature. We comment on\nthe physical implications of this conclusion. Our findings add support for the\nidea that both theory and data driven considerations will be best served if\nnext generation non-Gaussianity constraints are made in a basis that uses the\ndegree of coupling between long and short wavelength modes as an organizing\nprinciple.\n", "  The Gravitoelectromagnetism (GEM) theory is considered in a lagrangian\nformulation using the Weyl tensor components. A perturbative approach to\ncalculate processes at zero temperature has been used. Here the GEM at finite\ntemperature is analyzed using Thermo Field Dynamics, real time finite\ntemperature quantum field theory. Transition amplitudes involving gravitons,\nfermions and photons are calculated for various processes. These amplitudes are\nlikely of interest in astrophysics.\n", "  We have detected molecular and atomic line emission from the hot and warm\ndisks of two Class I sources, IRAS 03445+3242 and IRAS 04239+2436 using the\nhigh resolution Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrograph (IGRINS). CO overtone\nband transitions and near-IR lines of Na I and Ca I, all in emission, trace the\nhot inner disk while CO rovibrational absorption spectra of the first overtone\ntransition trace the warm gas within the inner few AU of the disk. The\nemission-line profiles for both sources show evidence for Keplerian disks. A\nthin Keplerian disk with power-law temperature and column density profiles with\na projected rotational velocity of $\\sim$60--75 km s$^{-1}$ and a gas\ntemperature of $\\sim$3500 K at the innermost annulus can reproduce the CO\novertone band emission. Na I and Ca I emission lines also arise from this disk,\nbut they show complicated line features possibly affected by photospheric\nabsorption lines. Multi-epoch observations show asymmetric variations of the\nline profiles on one-year (CO overtone bandhead and atomic lines for IRAS\n03445+3242) or on one-day (atomic lines for IRAS 04239+2436) time scales,\nimplying non-axisymmetric features in disks. The narrow CO rovibrational\nabsorption spectra ($v$=0$\\rightarrow$2) indicate that both warm ($>$ 150 K)\nand cold ($\\sim$20--30 K) CO gas are present along the line of sight to the\ninner disk. This study demonstrates the power of IGRINS as a tool for studies\nof the sub-AU scale hot and AU-scale warm protoplanetary disks with its\nsimultaneous coverage of the full H and K bands with high spectral resolution\n($R$= 45,000) allowing many aspects of the sources to be investigated at once.\n", "  We have collected near-infrared to X-ray data of 20 multi-epoch heavily\nreddened SDSS quasars to investigate the physical mechanism of reddening. Of\nthese, J2317+0005 is found to be a UV cutoff quasar. Its continuum, which\nusually appears normal, decreases by a factor 3.5 at 3000{\\AA}, compared to its\nmore typical bright state during an interval of 23 days. During this sudden\ncontinuum cut-off, the broad emission line fluxes do not change, perhaps due to\nthe large size of the Broad Line Region (BLR), r > 23 / (1+z) days. The UV\ncontinuum may have suffered a dramatic drop out. However, there are some\ndifficulties with this explanation. Another possibility is that the intrinsic\ncontinuum did not change, but was temporarily blocked out, at least towards our\nline of sight. As indicated by X-ray observations, the continuum rapidly\nrecovers after 42 days. A comparison of the bright state and dim states would\nimply an eclipse by a dusty cloud with a reddening curve having a remarkably\nsharp rise shortward of 3500{\\AA}. Under the assumption of being eclipsed by a\nKeplerian dusty cloud, we characterized the cloud size with our observations,\nhowever, which is a little smaller than the 3000\\AA\\ continuum-emitting size\ninferred from accretion disk models. Therefore, we speculate this is due to a\nrapid outflow or inflow with a dusty cloud passing through our line-of-sight to\nthe center.\n", "  The intriguing exoplanet candidate KIC 12557548b is believed to have a\ncomet-like tail of dusty debris trailing a small rocky planet. The tail of\ndebris scatters up to 1.3% of the stellar light in the Kepler observatory's\nbandpass (0.42 um to 0.9 um). Observing the tail's transit depth at multiple\nwavelengths can reveal the composition and particle size of the debris,\nconstraining the makeup and lifetime of the sub-Mercury planet. Early dust\nparticle size predictions from the scattering of the comet-like tail pointed\ntowards a dust size of ~0.1 um for silicate compositions. These small particles\nwould produce a much deeper optical transit depth than near-infrared transit\ndepth. We measure a transmission spectrum for KIC 12557548b using the SpeX\nspectrograph (covering 0.8 um to 2.4 um) simultaneously with the MORIS imager\ntaking r' (0.63 um) photometry on the Infrared Telescope Facility for eight\nnights and one night in H band (1.63 um) using the Wide-Field IR Camera at the\nPalomar 200-inch telescope. The infrared spectra are plagued by systematic\nerrors, but we argue that sufficient precision is obtained when using\ndifferential spectroscopic calibration when combining multiple nights. The\naverage differential transmission spectrum is flat, supporting findings that\nKIC 12557548b's debris is likely composed of larger particles > ~0.5 um for\npyroxene and olivine and > ~0.2 um for iron and corundum. The r' photometric\ntransit depths are all below the average Kepler value, suggesting that the\nobservations occurred during a weak period or that the mechanisms producing\noptical broadband transit depths are suppressed.\n", "  The V-FASTR experiment on the Very Long Baseline Array was designed to detect\ndispersed pulses of milliseconds duration, such as fast radio bursts (FRBs). We\nuse all V-FASTR data through February 2015 to report V-FASTR's upper limits on\nthe rates of FRBs, and compare these with re-derived rates from Parkes FRB\ndetection experiments. V-FASTR's operation at lambda=20 cm allows direct\ncomparison with the 20 cm Parkes rate, and we derive a power-law limit of\n\\gamma<-0.4 (95% confidence limit) on the index of FRB source counts,\nN(>S)\\propto S^\\gamma. Using the previously measured FRB rate and the\nunprecedented amount of survey time spent searching for FRBs at a large range\nof wavelengths (0.3 cm > \\lambda > 90 cm), we also place frequency-dependent\nlimits on the spectral distribution of FRBs. The most constraining frequencies\nplace two-point spectral index limits of \\alpha_{20cm}^{4cm} < 5.8 and\n\\alpha_{90cm}^{20cm} > -7.6, where fluence F \\propto f^\\alpha if we assume true\nthe burst rate reported by Champion et al. (2016) of R(F~0.6 Jy ms) = 7 x 10^3\nsky^{-1} day^{-1} (for bursts of ~3 ms duration). This upper limit on \\alpha\nsuggests that if FRBs are extragalactic but non-cosmological, that on average\nthey are not experiencing excessive free-free absorption due to a medium with\nhigh optical depth (assuming temperature ~8,000 K), which excessively invert\ntheir low-frequency spectrum. This in turn implies that the dispersion of FRBs\narises in either or both of the intergalactic medium or the host galaxy, rather\nthan from the source itself.\n", "  We present radio continuum observations of the high-mass young stellar object\n(HMYSO) G345.4938+01.4677 made using the Australia Telescope Compact Array\n(ATCA) at 5, 9, 17, and 19 GHz. These observations provide definite evidence\nthat the outer and inner pairs of radio lobes consist of shock ionized material\nbeing excited by an underlying collimated and fast protostellar jet emanating\nfrom a hypercompact HII region. By comparing with images taken 6 yr earlier at\n5 and 9 GHz using the same telescope, we assess the proper motions of the radio\nsources. The outer West and East lobes exhibit proper motions of $64\\pm12$ and\n$48\\pm13$ milliarcsec yr$^{-1}$, indicating velocities projected in the plane\nof the sky and receding from G345.4938+01.4677 of $520$ and $390$ km s$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. The internal radio lobes also display proper motion signals\nconsistently receding from the HMYSO, with magnitudes of $17\\pm11$ and\n$35\\pm10$ milliarcsec yr$^{-1}$ for the inner West and East lobes,\nrespectively. The morphology of the outer West lobe is that of a detached bow\nshock. At 17 and 19 GHz, the outer East lobe displays an arcuate morphology\nalso suggesting a bow shock. These results show that disk accretion and jet\nacceleration --- possibly occurring in a very similar way compared with\nlow-mass protostars --- is taking place in G345.4938+01.4677 despite the\npresence of ionizing radiation and the associated hypercompact HII region.\n", "  Aims. The formation and properties of star clusters at the edge of H II\nregions are poorly known, partly due to limitations in angular resolution and\nsensitivity, which become particularly critical when dealing with extragalactic\nclusters. In this paper we study the stellar content and star-formation\nprocesses in the young N159W region in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n  Methods. We investigate the star-forming sites in N159W at unprecedented\nspatial resolution using JHKs-band images obtained with the GeMS/GSAOI\ninstrument on the Gemini South telescope. The typical angular resolution of the\nimages is of 100 mas, with a limiting magnitude in H of 22 mag (90 percent\ncompleteness). Photometry from our images is used to identify candidate young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in N159W. We also determine the H-band luminosity\nfunction of the star cluster at the centre of the H II region and use this to\nestimate its initial mass function (IMF).\n  Results. We estimate an age of 2 + or - 1 Myr for the central cluster, with\nits IMF described by a power-law with an index of gamma = - 1.05 + or - 0.2 ,\nand with a total estimated mass of 1300 solar mass. We also identify 104\ncandidate YSOs, which are concentrated in clumps and subclusters of stars,\nprincipally at the edges of the H II region. These clusters display signs of\nrecent and active star-formation such as ultra-compact H II regions, and\nmolecular outflows. This suggests that the YSOs are typically younger than the\ncentral cluster, pointing to sequential star-formation in N159W, which has\nprobably been influenced by interactions with the expanding H II bubble.\n", "  We investigate the red supergiant (RSG) population of M31, obtaining radial\nvelocities of 255 stars. These data substantiate membership of our\nphotometrically-selected sample, demonstrating that Galactic foreground stars\nand extragalactic RSGs can be distinguished on the basis of B-V, V-R two-color\ndiagrams. In addition, we use these spectra to measure effective temperatures\nand assign spectral types, deriving physical properties for 192 RSGs.\nComparison with the solar-metallicity Geneva evolutionary tracks indicates\nastonishingly good agreement. The most luminous RSGs in M31 are likely evolved\nfrom 25-30 Mo stars, while the vast majority evolved from stars with initial\nmasses of 20 Mo or less. There is an interesting bifurcation in the\ndistribution of RSGs with effective temperatures that increases with higher\nluminosities, with one sequence consisting of early K-type supergiants, and\nwith the other consisting of M-type supergiants that become later (cooler) with\nincreasing luminosities. This separation is only partially reflected in the\nevolutionary tracks, although that might be due to the mis-match in\nmetallicities between the solar Geneva models and the higher-than-solar\nmetallicity of M31. As the luminosities increase the median spectral type also\nincreases; i.e., the higher mass RSGs spend more time at cooler temperatures\nthan do those of lower luminosities, a result which is new to this study.\nFinally we discuss what would be needed observationally to successfully build a\nluminosity function that could be used to constrain the mass-loss rates of RSGs\nas our Geneva colleagues have suggested.\n", "  The ~2 Myr old classical T Tauri star CI Tau shows periodic variability in\nits radial velocity (RV) variations measured at infrared (IR) and optical\nwavelengths. We find that these observations are consistent with a massive\nplanet in a ~9-day period orbit. These results are based on 71 IR RV\nmeasurements of this system obtained over 5 years, and on 26 optical RV\nmeasurements obtained over 9 years. CI Tau was also observed photometrically in\nthe optical on 34 nights over ~one month in 2012. The optical RV data alone are\ninadequate to identify an orbital period, likely the result of star spot and\nactivity induced noise for this relatively small dataset. The infrared RV\nmeasurements reveal significant periodicity at ~9 days. In addition, the full\nset of optical and IR RV measurements taken together phase coherently and with\nequal amplitudes to the ~9 day period. Periodic radial velocity signals can in\nprinciple be produced by cool spots, hot spots, and reflection of the stellar\nspectrum off the inner disk, in addition to resulting from a planetary\ncompanion. We have considered each of these and find the planet hypothesis most\nconsistent with the data. The radial velocity amplitude yields an Msin(i) of\n~8.1 M_Jup; in conjunction with a 1.3 mm continuum emission measurement of the\ncircumstellar disk inclination from the literature, we find a planet mass of\n~11.3 M_Jup, assuming alignment of the planetary orbit with the disk.\n", "  We analyse the K2 short cadence data of the intermediate polar FO Aqr and\nprovide accurate and updated orbital and spin periodicities. We additionally\nfind small spin period changes as a function of orbital phase of ~0.02 seconds\ntranslating to velocities of ~ a few km/s. The obtained orbital-folded velocity\nprofile displays two clear maxima and minima, and cannot be explained by the\nradial velocity of the orbiting white dwarf. Instead we propose that the\nobserved velocities are the sum of the radial velocities of both the white\ndwarf and of the stellar surface facing the white dwarf which reprocesses the\nWD spin pulses. This combination can explain the observed low velocities in FO\nAqr. However asymmetries in the orbital configuration are required to explain\nthe double peaked velocity profile. One possible scenario would invoke binary\neccentricity. We thus developed a simple binary model to explain and fit our\nobservations, and find a small binary eccentricity of e=0.03. Although small,\npersistent eccentricity in a close interacting binary would induce enhanced\nmass transfer occurring preferentially at periastron passages. We thus discuss\nalternative scenarios where other asymmetries might explain our observations\nassuming circular orbits. Since FO Aqr is the first system where the combined\nradial velocities of both the WD and secondary surface have been measured, it\nis possible that other mass-transferring binaries also display similar velocity\ncurves when observed with Kepler. These will provide additional valuable tests\nto either confirm or rule out small eccentricities in similar systems.\n", "  We investigate Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars as a source of feedback contributing to\nthe removal of natal material in the early evolution of massive star clusters.\nDespite previous work suggesting that massive star clusters clear out their\nnatal material before the massive stars evolve into the WR phase, WR stars have\nbeen detected in several emerging massive star clusters. These detections\nsuggest that the timescale for clusters to emerge can be at least as long as\nthe time required to produce WR stars (a few million years), and could also\nindicate that WR stars may be providing the tipping point in the combined\nfeedback processes that drive a massive star cluster to emerge. We explore the\npotential overlap between the emerging phase and the WR phase with an\nobservational survey to search for WR stars in emerging massive star clusters\nhosting WR stars. We select candidate emerging massive star clusters from known\nradio continuum sources with thermal emission and obtain optical spectra with\nthe 4m Mayall Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory and the 6.5m MMT. We\nidentify 21 sources with significantly detected WR signatures, which we term\n\"emerging WR clusters.\" WR features are detected in $\\sim$50% of the\nradio-selected sample, and thus we find that WR stars are commonly present in\nmassive star clusters currently emerging. The observed extinctions and ages\nsuggest that clusters without WR detections remain embedded for longer periods\nof time, and may indicate that WR stars can aid, and therefore accelerate, the\nemergence process.\n", "  We have theoretically investigated the time-symmetry breaking phase\ntransition process for two discrete states coupled with a one-dimensional\ncontinuum by solving the nonlinear eigenvalue prob- lem for the effective\nHamiltonian associated with the discrete spectrum. We obtain the effective\nHamiltonian with use of the Feshbach-Brillouin-Wigner projection method. Strong\nenergy depen- dence of the self-energy appearing in the effective Hamiltonian\nplays a key role in the time-symmetry breaking phase transition: as a result of\ncompetition in the decay process between the Van Hove singularity and the Fano\nresonance, the phase transition becomes a higher-order transition when both the\ntwo discrete states are located near the continuum threshold.\n", "  HH 111 is a Class I protostellar system at a distance of ~ 400 pc, with the\ncentral source VLA 1 associated with a rotating disk deeply embedded in a\nflattened envelope. Here we present the observations of this system at ~ 0.6\"\n(240 AU) resolution in C18O (J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum obtained with Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, and in SO obtained with Submillimeter\nArray. The observations show for the first time how a Keplerian rotating disk\ncan be formed inside a flattened envelope. The flattened envelope is detected\nin C18O, extending out to >~ 2400 AU from the VLA 1 source. It has a\ndifferential rotation, with the outer part (>~ 2000 AU) better described by a\nrotation that has constant specific angular momentum and the innermost part (<~\n160 AU) by a Keplerian rotation. The rotationally supported disk is therefore\nrelatively compact in this system, which is consistent with the dust continuum\nobservations. Most interestingly, if the flow is in steady state, there is a\nsubstantial drop in specific angular momentum in the envelope-disk transition\nregion from 2000 AU to 160 AU, by a factor of ~ 3. Such a decrease is not\nexpected outside a disk formed from simple hydrodynamic core collapse, but can\nhappen naturally if the core is significantly magnetized, because magnetic\nfields can be trapped in the transition region outside the disk by the ram\npressure of the protostellar accretion flow, which can lead to efficient\nmagnetic braking. In addition, SO shock emission is detected around the outer\nradius of the disk and could trace an accretion shock around the disk.\n", "  The century-long (1907-2007) Ca II K spectroheliograms from Kodaikanal Solar\nObservatory (KSO) are calibrated, processed and analysed in the present study\nto follow the evolution of bright on disc structures called plages, the\npossible representatives of magnetic activity on the Sun. This has been the\nlongest dataset studied in Ca II K till date covering about 9.5 cycles of 11\nyear periods. Plages were segmented with area $\\geq 1\\:\\textrm {arcmin}^2$\nusing global thresholds for individual full disc images and subsequent\napplication of morphological closing operation. Plage index was calculated and\nseen to have close positive correlation with fractional disc area covered by\nplages. The newly generated plage area cycle (from KSO) was compared with the\nsame from Mount Wilson observatory (Correlation~$95.6\\%$) for the overlapping\nyears i.e. 1915-2000. Study illustrated time-latitude distribution of plage\ncentroids rendering butterfly diagram (as observed for sunspots). The 3D\nvisualisation of the diagram showed one to one mapping between plage location,\ntime and area. This work further delineated positional correlation between\nmagnetic patches and plage regions through comparison of synoptic maps derived\nfrom both Kodaikanal Ca II K images and space based full disc LOS (line of\nsight) magnetograms. Regular synoptic magnetograms from ground based\nobservatories are available only after 1970s. Thus the long term Ca II K data\nfrom KSO can be used as a proxy for estimating magnetic activity locations and\ntheir strengths at earlier times.\n", "  For an observer, the Black Hole (BH) shadow is the BH's apparent image in the\nsky due to the gravitational lensing of nearby radiation, emitted by an\nexternal source. A recent class of solutions dubbed Kerr BHs with scalar hair\npossess smaller shadows than the corresponding Kerr BHs and, under some\nconditions, novel exotic shadow shapes can arise. Thus, these hairy BHs could\npotentially provide new shadow templates for future experiments such as the\nEvent Horizon Telescope. In order to obtain the shadows, the backward\nray-tracing algorithm is briefly introduced, followed by numerical examples of\nshadows of Kerr BHs with scalar hair contrasting with the Kerr analogues.\nAdditionally, an analytical solution for the Kerr shadow is derived in closed\nform for a ZAMO observer at an arbitrary position.\n", "  We determine abundances or upper limits for all of the 55 stable elements\nfrom copper to uranium for the A1 Vm star Sirius. The purpose of the study is\nto assemble the most complete picture of elemental abundances with the hope of\nrevealing the chemical history of the brightest star in the sky, apart from the\nSun. We also explore the relationship of this hot metallic-line (Am) star to\nits cooler congeners, as well as the hotter, weakly- or non-magnetic\nmercury-manganese (HgMn) stars. Our primary observational material consists of\n{\\em Hubble Space Telescope} ($HST$) spectra taken with the Space Telescope\nImaging Spectrograph (STIS) in the ASTRAL project. We have also used archival\nmaterial from the %\\citep/{ayr10}. $COPERNICUS$ satellite, and from the $HST$\nGoddard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), as well as ground-based spectra\nfrom Furenlid, Westin, Kurucz, Wahlgren, and their coworkers, ESO spectra from\nthe UVESPOP project, and NARVAL spectra retrieved from PolarBase. Our analysis\nhas been primarily by spectral synthesis, and in this work we have had the\ngreat advantage of extensive atomic data unavailable to earlier workers. We\nfind most abundances as well as upper limits range from 10 to 100 times above\nsolar values. We see no indication of the huge abundance excesses of 1000 or\nmore that occur among many chemically peculiar (CP) stars of the upper main\nsequence. The picture of Sirius as a hot Am star is reinforced.\n", "  Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models offer an attractive alternative to the current\nCold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological model. We present a novel method to\ndifferentiate between WDM and CDM cosmologies, namely using weak lensing; this\nprovides a unique probe as it is sensitive to all the \"matter in the beam\", not\njust dark matter haloes and the galaxies that reside in them, but also the\ndiffuse material between haloes. We compare the weak lensing maps of CDM\nclusters to those in a WDM model corresponding to a thermally produced\n$0.5$~keV dark matter particle. Our analysis clearly shows that the weak\nlensing magnification, convergence and shear distributions can be used to\ndistinguish between CDM and WDM models. WDM models {\\em increase} the\nprobability of weak magnifications, with the differences being significant to\n$\\gtrsim5\\sigma$, while leaving no significant imprint on the shear\ndistribution. WDM clusters analysed in this work are more homogeneous than CDM\nones, and the fractional decrease in the amount of material in haloes is\nproportional to the average increase in the magnification. This difference\narises from matter that would be bound in compact haloes in CDM being smoothly\ndistributed over much larger volumes at lower densities in WDM. Moreover, the\nsignature does not solely lie in the probability distribution function but in\nthe full spatial distribution of the convergence field.\n", "  PKS 0202$+$149 is a low-power radio source with blazar-like $\\gamma$-ray AGN\ncharacteristics and its properties and classification are investigated in\nrelation to its $\\gamma$-ray characteristics. It shows a hint of low frequency\nturnover at about 200 MHz. Radio imaging data of 0202$+$149 at different\nfrequencies show differing morphologies on both kilo-parsec (kpc) and parsec\n(pc) scales. The overall source shows a triple structure of core and double\nlobes with a total projected size of $\\sim$1.3 kpc. The compact source\nstructure of 0202+149 is reminiscent of a compact steep spectrum (CSS) source.\nAt pc scales a core-jet structure extends $\\sim$25 pc (in projection) at a\nposition angle perpendicular to the kpc-scale structure. The curved pc-scale\nstructure with jet and inner lobe suggests that the CSS nuclear activity has\nrecently re-started although its power has been decreasing, while the kpc-scale\nlobes are relics of earlier activity. A maximum apparent superluminal motion of\n$\\sim16\\,c$ is detected in the jet components, indicating a highly relativistic\njet flow. The brightness temperature of the core is lower than the average\nvalue found for highly-beamed $\\gamma$-ray AGN, indicating a lower radio power\nand a relatively lower Doppler boosting factor. The CSS radio classification\nindicates that blazar-like $\\gamma$-ray properties can also be manifested in\nlow-power CSS radio sources with appropriate jet and beaming properties.\n", "  Matter flows in the central regions of quasars during their active phases are\nprobably responsible for the properties of the super-massive black holes and\nthat of the bulges of host galaxies. To understand how this mechanism works, we\nneed to characterize the geometry and the physical state of the accreting\nmatter at cosmological redshifts. The few high quality X-ray spectra of distant\nQSO have been collected by adding sparse pointings of single objects obtained\nduring X-ray monitoring campaigns. This could have introduced spurious spectral\nfeatures due to source variability. Here we present a single epoch,\nhigh-quality X-ray spectrum of the z=3.62 quasar B1422+231 whose flux is\nenhanced by gravitationally lensing (F$_{2-10 keV}\\sim$10$^{-12}$erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$). The X-ray spectrum of B1422+231 is found to be very similar to the\none of a typical nearby Seyfert galaxy. Neutral absorption is detected\n(N$_{H}\\sim$5$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ at the redshift of the source) while a\nstrong absorption edge is measured at E$\\sim$7.5 keV with an optical depth of\n$\\tau\\sim$0.14. We also find hints of the FeK$\\alpha$ line in emission at\nE$\\sim$6.4 keV line (EW$\\lesssim$70 eV) and a hump is detected in the\nE$\\sim$15-20 keV energy band (rest-frame) suggesting the presence of a\nreflection component. In this scenario, the primary emission of B1422+231 is\nmost probably dominated by the thermal Comptonization of UV seed photons in a\ncorona with kT$\\sim$40 keV and the reflection component has a relative\ndirect-to-reflect normalization r$\\sim$1. These findings confirm that\ngravitational lensing is effective to obtain good quality X-ray spectral\ninformation of quasar at high-z, moreover they support the idea that the same\ngeneral picture characterizing active galactic nuclei in the nearby Universe is\nvalid also at high redshift.\n", "  In oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems, time-delay feedback can lead to\nthe instability of uniform oscillations with respect to formation of standing\nwaves. Here, we investigate how the presence of additive, Gaussian white noise\ncan induce the appearance of standing waves. Combining analytical solutions of\nthe model with spatio-temporal simulations, we find that noise can promote\nstanding waves in regimes where the deterministic uniform oscillatory modes are\nstabilized. As the deterministic phase boundary is approached, the\nspatio-temporal correlations become stronger, such that even small noise can\ninduce standing waves in this parameter regime. With larger noise strengths,\nstanding waves could be induced at finite distances from the (deterministic)\nphase boundary. The overall dynamics is defined through the interplay of noisy\nforcing with the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics.\n", "  Circumbinary planets experience a time varying irradiation pattern as they\norbit their two host stars. In this work, we present the first detailed study\nof the atmospheric effects of this irradiation pattern on known and\nhypothetical gaseous circumbinary planets. Using both a one-dimensional Energy\nBalance Model and a three-dimensional General Circulation Model, we look at the\ntemperature differences between circumbinary planets and their equivalent\nsingle-star cases in order to determine the nature of the atmospheres of these\nplanets. We find that for circumbinary planets on stable orbits around their\nhost stars, temperature differences are on average no more than 1.0% in the\nmost extreme cases. Based on detailed modeling with the General Circulation\nModel, we find that these temperature differences are not large enough to\nexcite circulation differences between the two cases. We conclude that gaseous\ncircumbinary planets can be treated as their equivalent single-star case in\nfuture atmospheric modeling efforts.\n", "  We present results of a spectroscopic survey for new K- and M-type members of\nScorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), the nearest OB Association (~100-200 pc). Using\nan X-ray, proper motion and color-magnitude selected sample, we obtained\nspectra for 361 stars, for which we report spectral classifications and Li and\nHalpha equivalent widths. We identified 156 new members of Sco-Cen, and\nrecovered 51 previously published members. We have combined these with\npreviously known members to form a sample of 493 solar-mass (~0.7-1.3 Msun)\nmembers of Sco-Cen. We investigated the star-formation history of this sample,\nand re-assessed the ages of the massive main-sequence turn-off and the G-type\nmembers in all three subgroups. We performed a census for circumstellar disks\nin our sample using WISE infrared data and find a protoplanetary disk fraction\nfor K-type stars of 4.4$^{+1.6}_{-0.9}$% for Upper Centaurus-Lupus and Lower\nCentaurus-Crux at ~16 Myr and 9.0$^{+4.0}_{-2.2}$% for Upper Scorpius at ~10\nMyr. These data are consistent with a protoplanetary disk e-folding timescale\nof ~4-5 Myr for ~1 Msun stars, twice that previously quoted (Mamajek 2009), but\nconsistent with the Bell et al. revised age scale of young clusters. Finally,\nwe construct an age map of Scorpius-Centaurus which clearly reveals\nsubstructure consisting of concentrations of younger and older stars. We find\nevidence for strong age gradients within all three subgroups. None of the\nsubgroups are consistent with being simple, coeval populations which formed in\nsingle bursts, but likely represents a multitude of smaller star formation\nepisodes of hundreds to tens of stars each.\n", "  We have obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members of\nthe star-forming clusters IC 348 and NGC 1333. We classify 100 and 42\ncandidates as new members of the clusters, respectively, which brings the total\nnumbers of known members to 478 and 203. We also have performed spectroscopy on\na large majority of the previously known members of NGC 1333 in order to\nprovide spectral classifications that are measured with the same scheme that\nhas been applied to IC 348 in previous studies. The new census of members is\nnearly complete for Ks<16.8 at Aj<1.5 in IC 348 and for Ks<16.2 at Aj<3 in NGC\n1333, which correspond to masses of <=0.01 Msun for ages of 3 Myr according to\ntheoretical evolutionary models. The faintest known members extend below these\ncompleteness limits and appear to have masses of ~0.005 Msun. In\nextinction-limited samples of cluster members, NGC 1333 exhibits a higher\nabundance of objects at lower masses than IC 348. It would be surprising if the\ninitial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their\nsimilar stellar densities and formation environments. Instead, it is possible\nthat average extinctions are lower for less massive members of star-forming\nclusters, in which case extinction-limited samples could be biased in favor of\nlow-mass objects in the more heavily embedded clusters like NGC 1333. In the\nH-R diagram, the median sequences of IC 348 and NGC 1333 coincide with each\nother for the adopted distances of 300 and 235 pc, which would suggest that\nthey have similar ages. However, NGC 1333 is widely believed to be younger than\nIC 348 based on its higher abundance of disks and protostars and its greater\nobscuration. Errors in the adopted distances may be responsible for this\ndiscrepancy.\n", "  We report on an archival X-ray observation of the eclipsing RS CVn binary XY\nUMa ($\\rm P_{orb}\\approx$ 0.48d). In two $\\emph{Chandra}$ ACIS observations\nspanning 200 ks and almost five orbital periods, three flares occurred. We find\nno evidence for eclipses in the X-ray flux. The flares took place around times\nof primary eclipse, with one flare occurring shortly ($<0.125\\rm P_{orb}$)\nafter a primary eclipse, and the other two happening shortly ($<0.05\\rm\nP_{orb}$) before a primary eclipse. Two flares occurred within roughly one\norbital period ($\\Delta \\phi\\approx1.024\\rm P_{orb}$) of each other. We analyze\nthe light curve and spectra of the system, and investigate coronal length\nscales both during quiescence and during flares, as well as the timing of the\nflares. We explore the possibility that the flares are orbit-induced by\nintroducing a small orbital eccentricity, which is quite challenging for this\nclose binary.\n", "  A search for Supersymmetry involving the pair production of gluinos decaying\nvia third-generation squarks to the lightest neutralino is reported. It uses an\nLHC proton--proton dataset at a center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with\nan integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector in\n2015. The signal is searched for in events containing several energetic jets,\nof which at least three must be identified as $b$-jets, large missing\ntransverse momentum and, potentially, isolated electrons or muons. Large-radius\njets with a high mass are also used to identify highly boosted top quarks. No\nexcess is found above the predicted background. For neutralino masses below\napproximately 700 GeV, gluino masses of less than 1.78 TeV and 1.76 TeV are\nexcluded at the 95% CL in simplified models of the pair production of gluinos\ndecaying via sbottom and stop, respectively. These results significantly extend\nthe exclusion limits obtained with the $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV dataset.\n", "  Muon Spin Rotation ($\\mu$SR) and $^{19}$F Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements were performed to investigate the effect of Mn for Fe\nsubstitutions in La$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$AsO$_{0.89}$F$_{0.11}$\nsuperconductors. While for $y = 0$ a very low critical concentration of Mn ($x\n= 0.2$%) is needed to quench superconductivity, as $y$ increases the negative\nchemical pressure introduced by Y for La substitution stabilizes\nsuperconductivity and for $y= 20$% it is suppressed at Mn contents an order of\nmagnitude larger. A magnetic phase arises once superconductivity is suppressed\nboth for $y$=0 and for $y= 20$%. Low-energy spin fluctuations give rise to a\npeak in $^{19}$F NMR $1/T_1$ with an onset well above the superconducting\ntransition temperature and whose magnitude increases with $x$. Also the static\nmagnetic correlations probed by $^{19}$F NMR linewidth measurements show a\nmarked increase with Mn content. The disruption of superconductivity and the\nonset of the magnetic ground-state are discussed in the light of the proximity\nof LaFeAsO$_{0.89}$F$_{0.11}$ to a quantum critical point.\n", "  We use the 2015 Planck likelihood in combination with the Bicep2/Keck\nlikelihood (BKP and BK14) to constrain the chirality, $\\chi$, of primordial\ngravitational waves in a scale-invariant scenario. In this framework, the\nparameter $\\chi$ enters theory always coupled to the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\n$r$, e.g. in combination of the form $\\chi \\cdot r$. Thus, the capability to\ndetect $\\chi$ critically depends on the value of $r$. We find that with present\ndata set $\\chi$ is \\textit{de facto}unconstrained. We also provide forecasts\nfor $\\chi$ from future CMB experiments, including COrE+, exploring several\nfiducial values of $r$. We find that the current limit on $r$ is tight enough\nto disfavor a neat detection of $\\chi$. For example, in the unlikely case in\nwhich $r\\sim0.1(0.05)$, the maximal chirality case, i.e. $\\chi = \\pm1$, could\nbe detected with a significance of $\\sim2.5(1.5)\\sigma$ at best. We conclude\nthat the two-point statistics at the basis of CMB likelihood functions is\ncurrently unable to constrain chirality and may only provide weak limits on\n$\\chi$ in the most optimistic scenarios. Hence, it is crucial to investigate\nthe use of other observables, e.g. provided by higher order statistics, to\nconstrain these kind of parity violating theories with the CMB.\n", "  We consider the indirect detection signals for a self-consistent hidden\n$U(1)$ model containing a Majorana dark matter candidate, $\\chi$, a dark gauge\nboson, $Z'$, and a dark Higgs, $s$. Compared with a model containing only a\ndark matter candidate and $Z'$ mediator, the addition of the scalar provides a\nmass generation mechanism for the dark sector particles and is required in\norder to avoid unitarity violation at high energies. We find that the inclusion\nof the two mediators opens up a new two-body s-wave annihilation channel,\n$\\chi\\overline\\chi\\rightarrow sZ'$. This new process, which is missed in the\nusual single-mediator simplified model approach, can be the dominant\nannihilation channel. This provides rich phenomenology for indirect detection\nsearches, allows indirect searches to explore regions of parameter space not\naccessible with other commonly considered s-wave annihilation processes, and\nenables both the $Z'$ and scalar couplings to be probed. We examine the\nphenomenology of the sector with a focus on this new process, and determine the\nlimits on the model parameter space from Fermi data on dwarf spheriodal\ngalaxies and other relevant experiments.\n", "  Fitting the thermal X-ray spectra of neutron stars (NSs) in quiescent X-ray\nbinaries can constrain the masses and radii of NSs. The effect of undetected\nhot spots on the spectrum, and thus on the inferred NS mass and radius, has not\nyet been explored for appropriate atmospheres and spectra. A hot spot would\nharden the observed spectrum, so that spectral modeling tends to infer radii\nthat are too small. However, a hot spot may also produce detectable pulsations.\n  We simulated the effects of a hot spot on the pulsed fraction and spectrum of\nthe quiescent NSs X5 and X7 in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, using\nappropriate spectra and beaming for hydrogen atmosphere models, incorporating\nspecial and general relativistic effects, and sampling a range of system\nangles. We searched for pulsations in archival Chandra HRC-S observations of X5\nand X7, placing 90\\% confidence upper limits on their pulsed fractions below\n16\\%. We use these pulsation limits to constrain the temperature differential\nof any hot spots, and to then constrain the effects of possible hot spots on\nthe X-ray spectrum and the inferred radius from spectral fitting. We find that\nhot spots below our pulsation limit could bias the spectroscopically inferred\nradius downward by up to 28\\%. For Cen X-4 (which has deeper published\npulsation searches), an undetected hot spot could bias its inferred radius\ndownward by up to 10\\%. Improving constraints on pulsations from quiescent\nLMXBs may be essential for progress in constraining their radii.\n", "  In this paper we investigate di-atomic molecules embedded in ice crystals\nunder strain. In this environment coherent vibrations of many OH-bonds may be\ngenerated by one WIMP collision. The detection of such multiple-photon signals\nmay provide a signature of a 100~GeV/c${^2}$ WIMP. To do a proper lab test of\nWIMP-induced multi-photon emission is very difficult. We suggest that Ice Cube\nmake a search for multi-photon events, and investigate whether the rate of such\nevents exhibits yearly modulation.\n", "  We propose an action for unstable Dp-brane with dynamical tension. We show\nthat the equations of motion are equivalent to the equations of motion derived\nfrom DBI and WZ actions for non-BPS Dp-brane. We also find Hamiltonian\nformulation of this action and analyze properties of the solutions\ncorresponding to the tachyon vacuum and zero tension solution.\n", "  The article analyzes the contribution of stochastic thermal fluctuations in\nthe attachment times of the immature T-cell receptor TCR:\npeptide-major-histocompatibility-complex pMHC immunological synapse bond. The\nkey question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain\nstabilized in the presence of high frequency thermal noise that potentially\nequates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence\nof an immature synapse, we show that the high frequency nodes accompanying\nlarge fluctuations are counterbalanced by low frequency nodes that evolve over\nlonger time periods. Our analysis shows that such a behavior could be easily\nexplained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed\nby two distinct phases, for the two different time regimes. The relatively\nshorter time scales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond\nformation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation\nregime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimation of the bond survival\nprobability, we show that at shorter time scales, this probability\n$P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)$ scales with time $\\tau$ as an universal function of a\nrescaled noise amplitude $\\frac{D}{\\Delta^2}$, such that $P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)\\sim\n\\tau^{-(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{D}}+\\frac{1}{2})}$, $\\Delta$ being the distance\nfrom the mean inter-membrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation\ndistance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to an\nuniversality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a\ndifferent power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter time scales. In\nbiological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a\nsurvival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond\njustifying its stability.\n", "  Carbon monoxide (CO) absorption in the sub-damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorber at\nredshift $z_{abs} \\simeq 2.69$, toward the background quasar SDSS\nJ123714.60+064759.5 (J1237+0647), was investigated for the first time in order\nto search for a possible variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, $\\mu$,\nover a cosmological time-scale. The observations were performed with the Very\nLarge Telescope/Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph with a\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 40 per 2.5 kms$^{-1}$ per pixel at $\\sim 5000$ \\AA.\nThirteen CO vibrational bands in this absorber are detected: the A$^{1}\\Pi$ -\nX$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ ($\\nu'$,0) for $\\nu' = 0 - 8$, B$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ -\nX$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0), C$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ - X$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0), and\nE$^{1}\\Pi$ - X$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) singlet-singlet bands and the\nd$^{3}\\Delta$ - X$^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ (5,0) singlet-triplet band. An updated\ndatabase including the most precise molecular inputs needed for a\n$\\mu$-variation analysis is presented for rotational levels $J = 0 - 5$,\nconsisting of transition wavelengths, oscillator strengths, natural lifetime\ndamping parameters, and sensitivity coefficients to a variation of the\nproton-to-electron mass ratio. A comprehensive fitting method was used to fit\nall the CO bands at once and an independent constraint of $\\Delta\\mu/\\mu = (0.7\n\\pm 1.6_{stat} \\pm 0.5_{syst}) \\times 10^{-5}$ was derived from CO only. A\ncombined analysis using both molecular hydrogen and CO in the same J1237+0647\nabsorber returned a final constraint on the relative variation of\n$\\Delta\\mu/\\mu = (-5.6 \\pm 5.6_{stat} \\pm 3.1_{syst}) \\times 10^{-6}$, which is\nconsistent with no variation over a look-back time of $\\sim 11.4$ Gyrs.\n", "  Observations with RXTE (Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer) revealed the presence of\nHigh Frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (HFQPOs) of the X-ray flux from\nseveral accreting stellar mass Black Holes. HFQPOs (and their counterparts at\nlower frequencies) may allow us to study general relativity in the strong\ngravity regime. However, the observational evidence today does not yet allow us\nto distinguish between different HFQPO models. In this paper we use a general\nrelativistic ray-tracing code to investigate X-ray timing-spectroscopy and\npolarization properties of HFQPOs in the orbiting Hotspot model. We study\nobservational signatures for the particular case of the 166 Hz quasi-periodic\noscillation (QPO) in the galactic binary GRS 1915+105. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of the observability of spectral signatures with a\ntiming-spectroscopy experiment like the LOFT (Large Observatory for X-ray\nTiming) and polarization signatures with space-borne X-ray polarimeters such as\nIXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer), PolSTAR (Polarization Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array), PRAXyS (Polarimetry of Relativistic X-ray Sources), or XIPE\n(X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer). A high count-rate mission like LOFT would\nmake it possible to get a QPO phase for each photon, enabling the study of the\nQPO-phase-resolved spectral shape and the correlation between this and the flux\nlevel. Owing to the short periods of the HFQPOs, first-generation X-ray\npolarimeters would not be able to assign a QPO phase to each photon. The study\nof QPO-phase-resolved polarization energy spectra would thus require\nsimultaneous observations with a first-generation X-ray polarimeter and a\nLOFT-type mission.\n", "  In this brief communication we provide the rationale for, and the outcome of\nthe International Astronomical Union (IAU) resolution vote at the XXIX-th\nGeneral Assembly in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 2015, on recommended nominal\nconversion constants for selected solar and planetary properties. The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU\n2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The\nresolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are\nby definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should\nbe understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary\nproperties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to\njoin in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work\nand publications to help minimize further confusion.\n", "  Using MHD seismology by observed kink waves, the magnetic field profile of a\ncoronal streamer has been investigated. STEREO-B/EUVI temporal image data on 7\nMarch 2012 shows an evolution of two consecutive EUV waves that interact with\nthe footpoint of a coronal streamer evident in the co-spatial and co-temporal\nSTEREO-B/COR-I observations. The evolution of EUV waves is clearly evident in\nSTEREO-B/EUVI, and its energy exchange with coronal streamer generates kink\noscillations. We estimate the phase velocities of the kink wave perturbations\nby tracking it at different heights of the coronal streamer. We also estimate\nthe electron densities inside and outside the streamer using SSI of polarized\nbrightness images in STEREO-B/COR-1 observations. Taking into account the MHD\ntheory of kink waves in a cylindrical waveguide, their observed properties at\nvarious heights, and density contrast of the streamer, we estimate the radial\nprofile of magnetic field within this magnetic structure. Both the kink waves\ndiagnose the exponentially decaying radial profiles of the magnetic field in\ncoronal steamer upto 3 solar radii. Within the limit of uncertainties in the\nmeasurements, it is indicated that coronal magnetic field of the streamer\nvaries slowly in time at various heights, although its nature always remains\nexponentially decaying. It is seen that during the evolution of second kink\nmotion in the streamer, it increases in brightness, and also in areal extent\nslightly, which may be associated with the decreased photospheric magnetic flux\nat its footpoint. As a result, the magnetic field profile produced by the\nsecond kink wave is reduced within the streamer compared to the one diagnosed\nby the first one. The precisely estimated magnetic field profiles with the\nuncertainty less than 10% match well with the empirical profile and various\nobservational estimations of the outer coronal magnetic field.\n", "  We present sub-millimeter spectra of HCN isotopologues on Titan, derived from\npublicly available ALMA flux calibration observations of Titan taken in early\n2014. We report the detection of a new HCN isotopologue on Titan,\nH$^{13}$C$^{15}$, and confirm an earlier report of detection of DCN. We model\nhigh signal-to-noise observations of HCN, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, DCN, and\nH$^{13}$C$^{15}$ to derive abundances and infer the following isotopic ratios:\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 89.8 $\\pm$ 2.8, $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N = 72.3 $\\pm$ 2.2, D/H =\n(2.5 $\\pm$ 0.2)$\\times$10$^{-4}$, and HCN/H$^{13}$C$^{15}$ = 5800 $\\pm$ 270\n(1$\\sigma$ errors). The carbon and nitrogen ratios are consistent with and\nimprove on the precision of previous results, confirming a factor of $\\sim$2.3\nelevation in $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N in HCN compared to N$_2$ and a lack of\nfractionation in $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C from the protosolar value. This is the first\npublished measurement of D/H in a nitrile species on Titan, and we find\nevidence for a factor of $\\sim$2 deuterium enrichment in hydrogen cyanide\ncompared to methane. The isotopic ratios we derive may be used as constraints\nfor future models to better understand the fractionation processes occurring in\nTitan's atmosphere.\n", "  Many fully convective stars exhibit a wide variety of surface magnetism,\nincluding starspots and chromospheric activity. The manner by which bundles of\nmagnetic field traverse portions of the convection zone to emerge at the\nstellar surface is not especially well understood. In the Solar context, some\ninsight into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as\nconsisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFT). Here, we present the\nresults of a large set of TFT simulations in a rotating spherical domain of\nconvective flows representative of a 0.3 solar-mass, main-sequence star. This\nis the first study to investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star\nmight rise under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and\ndifferential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective flow field,\ntaken from separate 3D simulations calculated with the anelastic equations,\nimpacts the flux tube as it rises. Convective motions modulate the shape of the\ninitially buoyant flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in\nfully convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the rotation\naxis. However, the presence of strong differential rotation allows some\ninitially low latitude flux tubes of moderate strength to develop rising loops\nthat emerge in the near-equatorial region. Magnetic pumping suppresses the\nglobal rise of the flux tube most efficiently in the deeper interior and at\nlower latitudes. The results of these simulations aim to provide a link between\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields, fluid motions, and observations of starspots\nfor fully convective stars.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic field in an intermediate-velocity filament for\nwhich the H$\\alpha$ intensity in the WHAM survey correlates with excess Faraday\nrotation of extragalactic radio sources over the length of the filament from b\n~ 20 degr. to b ~ 55 degr. The density-weighted mean magnetic field is 2.8 +/-\n0.8 microgauss, derived from rotation measures and an empirical relation\nbetween H-alpha emission measure and dispersion measure from Berkhuijsen et al.\n(2006). In view of the uncertainties in the derived magnetic field strength, we\npropose an alternative use of the available data, rotation measure and emission\nmeasure, to derive a lower limit to the Alfven speed, weighted by electron\ndensity n_e^1.5. We find lower limits to the Alfven speed that are comparable\nto, or larger than the sound speed in a 10^4 K plasma, and conclude that the\nmagnetic field is dynamically important. We discuss the role of\nintermediate-velocity gas as a locus of Faraday rotation in the interstellar\nmedium, and propose this lower limit to the Alfven speed may also be applicable\nto Faraday rotation by galaxy clusters.\n", "  We develop a generalized gradient expansion of the inhomogeneous dynamical\nmean-field theory method for determining properties of ultracold atoms in a\ntrap. This approach goes beyond the well-known local density approximation and\nat higher temperatures, in the normal phase, it shows why the local density\napproximation works so well, since the local density and generalized gradient\napproximations are essentially indistinguishable from each other (and from the\nexact solution within full inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory). But\nbecause the generalized gradient expansion only involves nearest-neighbor\ncorrections, it does not work as well at low temperatures, when the systems\nenter into ordered phases. This is primarily due to the problem that ordered\nphases often satisfy some global constraints which determine the spatial\nordering pattern, and the local density and generalized gradient approximations\nare not able to impose those kinds of constraints; they also overestimate the\ntendency to order. The theory is applied to phase separation of different mass\nfermionic mixtures represented by the Falicov-Kimball model and to determining\nthe entropy per particle of a fermionic system represented by the Hubbard\nmodel. The generalized gradient approximation is a useful diagnostic for the\naccuracy of the local density approximation---when both methods agree, they are\nlikely accurate, when they disagree, neither is likely to be correct.\n", "  We make use of the Hubble Space Telescope proper-motion catalogs derived by\nBellini et al. (2014) to produce the first radial velocity-dispersion profiles\nsigma(R) for blue straggler stars (BSSs) in Galactic globular clusters (GCs),\nas well as the first dynamical estimates for the average mass of the entire BSS\npopulation. We show that BSSs typically have lower velocity dispersions than\nstars with mass equal to the main-sequence turnoff mass, as one would expect\nfor a more massive population of stars. Since GCs are expected to experience\nsome degree of energy equipartition, we use the relation sigma~M^-eta, where\neta is related to the degree of energy equipartition, along with our\nvelocity-dispersion profiles to estimate BSS masses. We estimate eta as a\nfunction of cluster relaxation from recent Monte Carlo cluster simulations by\nBianchini et al. (2016b) and then derive an average mass ratio M_BSS\n/M_MSTO=1.50+/-0.14 and an average mass M_BSS=1.22+/-0.12 M_Sun from 598 BSSs\nacross 19 GCs. The final error bars include any systematic errors that are\nrandom between different clusters, but not any potential biases inherent to our\nmethodology. Our results are in good agreement with the average mass of\nM_BSS=1.22+/-0.06 M_Sun for the 35 BSSs in Galactic GCs in the literature with\nproperties that have allowed individual mass determination.\n", "  We calculate the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order (N$^3$LO) QCD\ncorrections to inclusive vector-boson fusion (VBF) Higgs production at proton\ncolliders, in the limit in which there is no colour exchange between the\nhadronic systems associated with the two colliding protons. We also provide\ndifferential cross sections for the Higgs transverse momentum and rapidity\ndistributions. We find that the corrections are at the 1-2 permille level, well\nwithin the scale-uncertainty of the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO)\ncalculation. The associated scale-uncertainty of the N$^3$LO calculation is\ntypically found to be below the 2 permille level. We also consider theoretical\nuncertainties due to missing higher order parton distribution functions, and\nprovide an estimate of their importance.\n", "  We report continued Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet spectra and\nground-based optical photometry and spectroscopy of GW Librae eight years after\nits largest known dwarf nova outburst in 2007. This represents the longest\ncooling timescale measured for any dwarf nova. The spectra reveal that the\nwhite dwarf still remains about 3000 K hotter than its quiescent value. Both\nultraviolet and optical light curves show a short period of 364-373 s, similar\nto one of the non-radial pulsation periods present for years prior to the\noutburst, and with a similar large UV/optical amplitude ratio. A large\nmodulation at a period of 2 h (also similar to that observed prior to outburst)\nis present in the optical data preceding and during the HST observations, but\nthe satellite observation intervals did not cover the peaks of the optical\nmodulation so it is not possible to determine its corresponding UV amplitude.\nThe similarity of the short and long periods to quiescent values implies the\npulsating, fast spinning white dwarf in GW Lib may finally be nearing its\nquiescent configuration.\n", "  We study self-oscillations of an optomechanical system, where coherent\nmechanical oscillations are induced by a driven optical or microwave cavity,\nfor the case of an anharmonic mechanical oscillator potential. A semiclassical\nanalytical model is developed to characterize the limit cycle for large\nmechanical amplitudes corresponding to a weak nonlinearity. As a result, we\npredict conditions to achieve subpoissonian phonon statistics in the steady\nstate, indicating classically forbidden behavior. We compare with numerical\nsimulations and find very good agreement. Our model is quite general and can be\napplied to other physical systems such as trapped ions or superconducting\ncircuits.\n", "  We show that already at the NLO level the DGLAP evolution kernel Pqq starts\nto depend on the choice of the evolution variable. We give an explicit example\nof such a variable, namely the maximum of transverse momenta of emitted partons\nand we identify a class of evolution variables that leave the NLO Pqq kernel\nunchanged with respect to the known standard MS-bar results. The kernels are\ncalculated using a modified Curci-Furmanski-Petronzio method which is based on\na direct Feynman-graphs calculation.\n", "  We report on Green Bank Telescope 23.87 GHz NH$_3$(3,3), emission\nobservations in five supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds\n(G1.4$-$0.1, IC443, W44, W51C, and G5.7$-$0.0). The observations show a clumpy\ngas density distribution, and in most cases the narrow line widths of\n$\\sim3-4$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$ are suggestive of maser emission. Very Large Array\nobservations reveal 36~GHz and/or 44~GHz CH$_3$OH, maser emission in a majority\n(72\\%) of the NH$_3$, peak positions towards three of these SNRs. This good\npositional correlation is in agreement with the high densities required for the\nexcitation of each line. Through these observations we have shown that\nCH$_3$OH, and NH$_3$, maser emission can be used as indicators of high density\nclumps of gas shocked by supernova remnants, and provide density estimates\nthereof. Modeling of the optical depth of the NH$_3$(3,3) emission is compared\nto that of CH$_3$OH, constraining the densities of the clumps to a typical\ndensity of the order of $10^5$~cm$^{-3}$ for cospatial masers. Regions of gas\nwith this density are found to exist in the post-shocked gas quite close to the\nSNR shock front, and may be associated with sites where cosmic rays produce\ngamma-ray emission via neutral pion decay.\n", "  There is mounting evidence that supermassive black holes form and grow in\nbulgeless galaxies. However, a robust determination of the fraction of AGNs in\nbulgeless galaxies, an important constraint to models of supermassive black\nhole seed formation and merger-free models of AGN fueling, is unknown, since\noptical studies have been shown to be incomplete for low mass AGNs. In a recent\nstudy using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we discovered hundreds of\nbulgeless galaxies that display mid-infrared signatures of extremely hot dust\nsuggestive of powerful accreting massive black holes, despite having no\nsignatures of black hole activity at optical wavelengths. Here we report X-ray\nfollow-up observations of J122434.66+555522.3, a nearby (z=0.052) isolated\nbulgeless galaxy that contains an unresolved X-ray source detected at the 3\nsigma level by XMM-Newton with an observed luminosity uncorrected for intrinsic\nabsorption of L{2-10~keV}=1.1+/-0.4 10^40 ergs/s. Ground-based near-infrared\nspectroscopy with the Large Binocular Telescope together with multiwavelength\nobservations from ultraviolet to millimeter wavelengths together suggest that\nJ1224+5555 harbors a highly absorbed AGN with an intrinsic absorption of ~NH\n>10^24 cm^-2. The hard X-ray luminosity of the putative AGN corrected for\nabsorption is L{2-10~keV}~3x10^42 ergs/s, which, depending on the bolometric\ncorrection factor, corresponds to a bolometric luminosity of the AGN of\n6x10^43ergs/s - 3x10^44 erg/s, and a lower mass limit for the black hole of\nMBH~2x10^6 Msun, based on the Eddington limit.\n", "  Here we report on new, multi-wavelength radio observations of the unusual\npoint source \"N3\" that appears to be located in the vicinity of the Galactic\nCenter. VLA observations between 2 and 50 GHz reveal that N3 is a compact and\nbright source (56 mJy at 10 GHz) with a non-thermal spectrum superimposed upon\nthe non-thermal radio filaments (NTFs) of the Radio Arc. Our highest frequency\nobservations place a strict upper limit of 65 x 28 mas on the size of N3. We\ncompare our observations to those of Yusef-Zadeh & Morris (1987) and Lang et\nal. (1997) and conclude that N3 is variable over long time scales.\nAdditionally, we present the detection of a compact molecular cloud located\nadjacent to N3 in projection. CH3CN, CH3OH, CS, HC3N, HNCO, SiO, SO, and NH3\nare detected in the cloud and most transitions have FWHM line widths of ~20\nkm/s. The rotational temperature determined from the metastable NH3 transitions\nranges from 79 K to 183 K depending on the transitions used. We present\nevidence that this molecular cloud is interacting with N3. After exploring the\nrelationship between the NTFs, molecular cloud, and N3, we conclude that N3\nlikely lies within the Galactic Center. We are able to rule out the HII region,\nyoung supernova, active star, AGN, and micro-quasar hypotheses for N3. While a\nmicro-blazar may provide a viable explanation for N3, additional observations\nare needed to determine the physical counterpart of this mysterious source.\n", "  In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of the degeneracy between the\nmicrolens-parallax and lens-orbital effects by presenting the analysis of the\ngravitational binary-lens event OGLE-2015-BLG-0768. Despite the obvious\ndeviation from the model based on the the linear observer motion and the static\nbinary, it is found that the residual can be almost equally well explained by\neither the parallactic motion of the Earth or the rotation of the binary lens\naxis, resulting in the severe degeneracy between the two effects. We show that\nthe degeneracy can be readily resolved with the additional data provided by\nspace-based microlens parallax observations. Enabling to distinguish between\nthe two higher-order effects, space-based microlens parallax observations will\nmake it possible not only to accurately determine the physical lens parameters\nbut also to further constrain the orbital parameters of binary lenses.\n", "  The atomic features in the X-ray spectra of the ultraluminous X-ray source\n(ULX) may be associated with the outflow (Middleton et al. 2015), which may\nprovide a way to explore the physics of the ULXs. We construct a conical\noutflow model, and calculate the thermal X-ray Fe emission lines from the\noutflows. Our results show that thermal line luminosity decreases with\nincreasing outflow velocity or/and opening angle of the outflow for a fixed\nkinetic power of the outflows. Assuming the kinetic power of the outflows to be\ncomparable with the accretion power in the ULXs, we find that the equivalent\nwidth can be several eV for the thermal X-ray Fe emission line from the\noutflows in the ULXs with stellar mass black holes. The thermal line luminosity\nis proportional to 1/M (M is the black hole mass of the ULX). The equivalent\nwidth decreases with the black hole mass, which implies that the Fe line\nemission from the outflows can hardly be detected if the ULXs contain\nintermediate mass black holes. Our results suggest that the thermal X-ray Fe\nline emission should be preferentially be detected in the ULXs with high\nkinetic power slowly moving outflows from the accretion disks surrounding\nstellar mass black holes/neutron stars. The recent observed X-ray atomic\nfeatures of the outflows in the ULX may imply that it contains a stellar mass\nblack hole/neutron star (Pinto et al. 2016).\n", "  Using AdS/CFT correspondence, we find that a massless quark moving at the\nspeed of light $v=1$, in arbitrary direction, through a strongly coupled\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) vacuum at $T=0$, in the presence of\nstrong magnetic field $\\mathcal{B}$, loses its energy at a rate linearly\ndependent on $\\mathcal{B}$, i.e.,\n$\\frac{dE}{dt}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{6\\pi}\\mathcal{B}$. We also show that a\nheavy quark of mass $M\\neq 0$ moving at near the speed of light\n$v^2=v_{*}^2=1-\\frac{4\\pi^2 T^2}{\\mathcal{B}}\\simeq1$, in arbitrary direction,\nthrough a strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma at finite temperature\n$T\\neq 0$, in the presence of strong magnetic field $\\mathcal{B}\\gg T^2$, loses\nits energy at a rate linearly dependent on $\\mathcal{B}$, i.e.,\n$\\frac{dE}{dt}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{6\\pi}\\mathcal{B}v_{*}^2\\simeq-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\lambda}}{6\\pi}\\mathcal{B}$.\nMoreover, we argue that, in the strong magnetic field $\\mathcal{B}\\gg T^2$ (IR)\nregime, $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and adjoint QCD theories (when the adjoint QCD\ntheory has four flavors of Weyl fermions and is at its conformal IR fixed point\n$\\lambda=\\lambda^*$) have the same microscopic degrees of freedom (i.e., gluons\nand lowest Landau levels of Weyl fermions) even though they have quite\ndifferent microscopic degrees of freedom in the UV when we consider higher\nLandau levels. Therefore, in the strong magnetic field $\\mathcal{B}\\gg T^2$\n(IR) regime, the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSYM and adjoint QCD plasmas, as well as the rates of energy loss of a quark\nmoving through the plasmas, should be the same.\n", "  We investigate duality in entanglement of a bipartite multi-photon system\ngenerated from a coherent state of light. The system can exhibit polarization\nentanglement if the two parts are distinguished by their parity, or parity\nentanglement if the parts are distinguished by polarization. It was shown in\n[PRL 110, 140404 (2013)] that this phenomenon can be exploited as a method to\ntest indistinguishability of two particles and it was conjectured that one can\nalso test indistinguishability of macroscopic systems. We propose a setup to\ntest this conjecture. Contrary to the previous studies using two-particle\ninterference effect as in Hong-Ou- Mandel setup, our setup neither assumes that\nthe tested state is composed of single particles nor requires that the total\nnumber of particles be fixed. Consequently the notion of entanglement duality\nis shown to be compatible with a broader class of physical systems. Moreover,\nby observing duality in entanglement in the above system one can confirm that\nmacroscopic systems exhibit quantum behaviour. As a practical side,\nentanglement duality is a useful concept that enables adaptive conversion of\nentanglement of one degree of freedom (DOF) to that of another DOF according to\nvarying quantum protocols.\n", "  The region around SGR 1806-20 and its host stellar cluster Cl* 1806-20 is a\npotentially important site of particle acceleration. The soft $\\gamma-$ray\nrepeater and Cl* 1806-20, which also contains several very massive stars\nincluding a luminous blue variable hypergiant LBV 1806-20, are capable of\ndepositing a large amount of energy to the surroundings. Using the data taken\nwith the \\emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT), we identified an extended LAT\nsource to the south-west of Cl* 1806-20. The centroid of the 1-50~GeV emission\nis consistent with that of HESS J1808-204 (until now unidentified). The LAT\nspectrum is best-fit by a broken power-law with the break energy\n$E_\\mathrm{b}=297\\pm15$ MeV. The index above $E_\\mathrm{b}$ is $2.60\\pm0.04$,\nand is consistent with the flux and spectral index above 100 GeV for HESS\nJ1808-204, suggesting an association between the two sources. Meanwhile, the\ninteracting supernova remnant SNR G9.7-0.0 is also a potential contributor to\nthe LAT flux. A tentative flux enhancement at the MeV band during a 45-day\ninterval (2011 Jan 21 - 2011 Mar 7) is also reported. We discuss possible\norigins of the extended LAT source in the context of both leptonic and hadronic\nscenarios.\n", "  We present a series of sixteen Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) high angular\nresolution observations of a cluster of suspected low-mass young stars in the\nMonoceros R2 region. Four compact and highly variable radio sources are\ndetected; three of them in only one epoch, the fourth one a total of seven\ntimes. This latter source is seen in the direction to the previously known\n\\UCHII\\ region VLA~1, and has radio properties that resemble those of\nmagnetically active stars; we shall call it VLA~1$^\\star$. We model its\ndisplacement on the celestial sphere as a combination of proper motion and\ntrigonometric parallax. The fit obtained using a uniform proper motion yields a\nparallax $\\varpi$ = 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.18 mas, but with a fairly high post-fit\ndispersion. If acceleration terms (probably due to an undetected companion) are\nincluded, the quality of the fit improves dramatically, and the best estimate\nof the parallax becomes $\\varpi$ = 1.12 $\\pm$ 0.05 mas. The magnitude of the\nfitted acceleration suggest an orbital period of order a decade. The measured\nparallax corresponds to a distance $d$ = 893$^{+44}_{-40}$ pc, in very good\nagreement with previous, indirect, determinations.\n", "  High resolution stellar spectroscopic surveys provide massive amounts of\ndiffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) measurements. Data can be used to study the\ndistribution of the DIB carriers and those environmental conditions that favor\ntheir formation. In parallel, recent studies have also proved that DIBs\nextracted from stellar spectra constitute new tools for building the 3D\nstructure of the Galactic Interstellar Medium (ISM). The amount of details on\nthe structure depends directly on the quantity of available lines of sight\n(LOS). Therefore there is a need to construct databases of high-quality DIB\nmeasurements as large as possible. We aim at providing the community with a\ncatalog of high-quality measurements of the 1.5273 micron DIB towards a large\nfraction of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)\nhot stars observed to correct for the telluric absorption and not used for ISM\nstudies so far. This catalog would complement the extensive database recently\nextracted from the APOGEE observations and used for 3D ISM mapping. We devised\na method to fit the stellar continuum of the hot calibration stars and\nextracted the DIB from the normalized spectrum. Severe selection criteria based\non the absorption characteristics are applied to the results. In particular\nlimiting constraints on the DIB widths and Doppler shifts are deduced from the\nHI 21 cm measurements, following a new technique of decomposition of the\nemission spectra. From ~16 000 available hot telluric spectra we have extracted\n~ 6700 DIB measurements and their associated uncertainties. The statistical\nproperties of the extracted absorptions are examined and our selection criteria\nare shown to provide a robust dataset. The resulting catalog contains the DIB\ntotal equivalent widths, central wavelengths and widths. We briefly illustrate\nits potential use for the stellar and interstellar communities.\n", "  Occultation light curves of exomoons may give information on their albedo and\nhence indicate the presence of ice cover on the surface. Icy moons might have\nsubsurface oceans thus these may potentially be habitable. The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements. Our calculations in the J photometric band show that E-ELT\nMICADO's photon noise is just about 4 ppm greater than the flux difference\ncaused by a 2 Earth-radii icy satellite in a circular orbit at the snowline of\nan 0.1 stellar mass star. However, considering only photon noise underestimates\nthe real expected noise, because other noise sources, such as CCD read-out and\ndark signal become significant in the near infrared measurements. Hence we\nconclude that occultation measurements with next generation missions are far\ntoo challenging, even in the case of large, icy moons at the snowline of small\nM dwarfs. We also discuss the role of the parameters that were neglected in the\ncalculations, e.g. inclination, eccentricity, orbiting direction of the moon.\nWe predict that the first albedo estimations of exomoons will probably be made\nfor large icy moons around the snowline of M4 -- M9 type main sequence stars.\n", "  We propose a novel theoretical model to describe a physical identity of the\nsoft X-ray excess, ubiquitously detected in many Seyfert galaxies, by\nconsidering a steady-state, axisymmetric plasma accretion within the innermost\nstable circular orbit (ISCO) around a black hole (BH) accretion disk. We extend\nour earlier theoretical investigations on general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion which has implied that the accreting\nplasma can develop into a standing shock for suitable physical conditions\ncausing the downstream flow to be sufficiently hot due to shock compression. We\nnumerically calculate to examine, for sets of fiducial plasma parameters, a\nphysical nature of fast MHD shocks under strong gravity for different BH spins.\nWe show that thermal seed photons from the standard accretion disk can be\neffectively Compton up-scattered by the energized sub-relativistic electrons in\nthe hot downstream plasma to produce the soft excess feature in X-rays. As a\ncase study, we construct a three-parameter Comptonization model of inclination\nangle $\\theta_{\\rm obs}$, disk photon temperature $kT_{\\rm in}$ and downstream\nelectron energy $kT_e$ to calculate the predicted spectra in comparison with a\n60 ks {\\it XMM-Newton}/EPIC-pn spectrum of a typical radio-quiet Seyfert 1 AGN,\nArk~120. Our $\\chi^2$-analyses demonstrate that the model is plausible in\nsuccessfully describing data for both non-spinning and spinning BHs with the\nderived range of $61.3~{\\rm keV} \\lesssim kT_e \\lesssim 144.3~{\\rm keV}$,\n$21.6~{\\rm eV} \\lesssim kT_{\\rm in} \\lesssim 34.0~{\\rm eV}$ and $17.5\\degr\n\\lesssim \\theta_{\\rm obs} \\lesssim 42.6\\degr$ indicating a compact Comptonizing\nregion of $3-4$ gravitational radii that resembles the putative X-ray coronae.\n", "  New high-resolution far-infrared (FIR) observations of both ortho- and\npara-NH3 transitions toward IRC+10216 were obtained with Herschel, with the\ngoal of determining the ammonia abundance and constraining the distribution of\nNH3 in the envelope of IRC+10216. We used the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far\nInfrared (HIFI) on board Herschel to observe all rotational transitions up to\nthe J=3 level (three ortho- and six para-NH3 lines). We conducted non-LTE\nmultilevel radiative transfer modelling, including the effects of near-infrared\n(NIR) radiative pumping through vibrational transitions.\n  We found that NIR pumping is of key importance for understanding the\nexcitation of rotational levels of NH3. The derived NH3 abundances relative to\nmolecular hydrogen were (2.8+-0.5)x10^{-8} for ortho-NH3 and\n(3.2^{+0.7}_{-0.6})x10^{-8} for para-NH3, consistent with an ortho/para ratio\nof 1. These values are in a rough agreement with abundances derived from the\ninversion transitions, as well as with the total abundance of NH3 inferred from\nthe MIR absorption lines. To explain the observed rotational transitions,\nammonia must be formed near to the central star at a radius close to the end of\nthe wind acceleration region, but no larger than about 20 stellar radii (1\nsigma confidence level).\n", "  With the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we searched for young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in a 100 deg^2 region centered on the lightly studied\nCanis Major star forming region. Applying stringent magnitude cuts to exclude\nthe majority of extragalactic contaminants, we find 144 Class I candidates and\n335 Class II candidates. The sensitivity to Class II candidates is limited by\ntheir faintness at the distance to Canis Major (assumed as 1000 pc). More than\nhalf the candidates (53%) are found in 16 groups of more than four members,\nincluding four groups with more than 25 members each. The ratio of Class II to\nClass I objects, N_II/N_I, varies from 0.4 to 8.3 in just the largest four\ngroups. We compare our results to those obtainable with combined Two Micron All\nSky Survey (2MASS) and post-cryogenic Spitzer Space Telescope data; the latter\napproach recovers missing Class II sources. Via a comparison to protostars\ncharacterized with the Herschel Space Observatory, we propose new WISE color\ncriteria for flat-spectrum and Class 0 protostars, finding 80 and seven of\nthese, respectively. The distribution of YSOs in CMa OB1 is consistent with\nsupernova-induced star formation, although the diverse N_II/N_I ratios are\nunexpected if this parameter traces age and the YSOs are due to the same\nsupernova. Less massive clouds feature larger N_II/N_I ratios, suggesting that\ninitial conditions play a role in determining this quantity.\n", "  Context. Globular clusters host multiple populations of long-lived low-mass\nstars whose origin remains an open question. Several scenarios have been\nproposed to explain the associated photometric and spectroscopic peculiarities.\nThey differ, for instance, in the maximum helium enrichment they predict for\nstars of the second population, which these stars can inherit at birth as the\nresult of the internal pollution of the cluster by different types of stars of\nthe first population. Aims. We present the distribution of helium-rich stars in\npresent-day globular clusters as it is expected in the original framework of\nthe fast-rotating massive stars scenario (FRMS) as first-population polluters.\nWe focus on NGC 6752. (to be continued)\n", "  There is strong evidence that cosmological N-body simulations dominated by\nWarm Dark Matter (WDM) contain spurious or unphysical haloes, most readily\napparent as regularly spaced low-mass haloes strung along filaments. We show\nthat spurious haloes are a feature of traditional N-body simulations of\ncosmological structure formation models, including WDM and Cold Dark Matter\n(CDM) models, in which gravitational collapse proceeds in an initially\nanisotropic fashion, and arises naturally as a consequence of\ndiscreteness-driven relaxation. We demonstrate this using controlled N-body\nsimulations of plane-symmetric collapse and show that spurious haloes are\nseeded at shell crossing by localised velocity perturbations induced by the\ndiscrete nature of the density field, and that their characteristic separation\nshould be approximately the mean inter-particle separation of the N-body\nsimulation, which is fixed by the mass resolution within the volume. Using\ncosmological N-body simulations in which particles are split into two\ncollisionless components of fixed mass ratio, we find that the spatial\ndistribution of the two components show signatures of discreteness-driven\nrelaxation in their spatial distribution on both large and small scales.\nAdopting a spline kernel gravitational softening that is of order the comoving\nmean inter-particle separation helps to suppress the effect of\ndiscreteness-driven relaxation, but cannot eliminate it completely. These\nresults provide further motivation for recent developments of new algorithms,\nwhich include, for example, revisions of the traditional N-body approach by\nmeans of spatially adaptive anistropric gravitational softenings or explicit\nsolutions for the evolution of dark matter in phase space.\n", "  We present CO(1-0) observations obtained at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA) for 14 z~2 galaxies with existing CO(3-2) measurements, including\n11 galaxies which contain active galactic nuclei (AGN) and three submillimeter\ngalaxies (SMGs). We combine this sample with an additional 15 z~2 galaxies from\nthe literature that have both CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) measurements in order to\nevaluate differences in CO excitation between SMGs and AGN host galaxies,\nmeasure the effects of CO excitation on the derived molecular gas properties of\nthese populations, and to look for correlations between the molecular gas\nexcitation and other physical parameters. With our expanded sample of\nCO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio measurements, we do not find a statistically\nsignificant difference in the mean line ratio between SMGs and AGN host\ngalaxies as found in the literature, instead finding r_3,1=1.03+/-0.50 for AGN\nhost galaxies and r_3,1=0.78+/-0.27 for SMGs (or r_3,1=0.90+/-0.40 for both\npopulations combined). We also do not measure a statistically significant\ndifference between the distributions of the line ratios for these populations\nat the p=0.05 level, although this result is less robust. We find no excitation\ndependence on the index or offset of the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation\nfor the two CO lines, and obtain indices consistent with N=1 for the various\nsub-populations. However, including low-z \"normal\" galaxies increases our\nbest-fit Schmidt-Kennicutt index to N~1.2. While we do not reproduce\ncorrelations between the CO line width and luminosity, we do reproduce\ncorrelations between CO excitation and star formation efficiency.\n", "  We present a constrained transport (CT) algorithm for solving the 3D ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations on a moving mesh, which maintains the\ndivergence-free condition on the magnetic field to machine-precision. Our CT\nscheme uses an unstructured representation of the magnetic vector potential,\nmaking the numerical method simple and computationally efficient. The scheme is\nimplemented in the moving mesh code Arepo. We demonstrate the performance of\nthe approach with simulations of driven MHD turbulence, a magnetized disc\ngalaxy, and a cosmological volume with primordial magnetic field. We compare\nthe outcomes of these experiments to those obtained with a previously\nimplemented Powell divergence-cleaning scheme. While CT and the Powell\ntechnique yield similar results in idealized test problems, some differences\nare seen in situations more representative of astrophysical flows. In the\nturbulence simulations, the Powell cleaning scheme artificially grows the mean\nmagnetic field, while CT maintains this conserved quantity of ideal MHD. In the\ndisc simulation, CT gives slower magnetic field growth rate and saturates to\nequipartition between the turbulent kinetic energy and magnetic energy, whereas\nPowell cleaning produces a dynamically dominant magnetic field. Such difference\nhas been observed in adaptive-mesh refinement codes with CT and\nsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics codes with divergence-cleaning. In the\ncosmological simulation, both approaches give similar magnetic amplification,\nbut Powell exhibits more cell-level noise. CT methods in general are more\naccurate than divergence-cleaning techniques, and, when coupled to a moving\nmesh can exploit the advantages of automatic spatial/temporal adaptivity and\nreduced advection errors, allowing for improved astrophysical MHD simulations.\n", "  This study explored the GALEX ultraviolet (UV) properties of optical red\nsequence galaxies in 4 rich Abell clusters at z \\leq 0.1. In particular, we\ntried to find a hint of merger-induced recent star formation (RSF) in red\nsequence galaxies. Using the NUV - r' colors of the galaxies, RSF fractions\nwere derived based on various criteria for post-merger galaxies and normal\ngalaxies. Following k-correction, about 36% of the post-merger galaxies were\nclassified as RSF galaxies with a conservative criterion (NUV - r' \\leq 5), and\nthat number was doubled (~ 72%) when using a generous criterion (NUV - r' \\leq\n5.4). The trend was the same when we restricted the sample to galaxies within\n0.5xR_{200}. Post-merger galaxies with strong UV emission showed more violent,\nasymmetric features in the deep optical images. The RSF fractions did not show\nany trend along the clustocentric distance within R_{200}. We performed a\nDressler-Shectman test to check whether the RSF galaxies had any correlation\nwith the sub-structures in the galaxy clusters. Within R_{200} of each cluster,\nthe RSF galaxies did not appear to be preferentially related to the clusters'\nsub-structures. Our results suggested that only 30% of RSF red sequence\ngalaxies show morphological hints of recent galaxy mergers. This implies that\ninternal processes (e.g., stellar mass-loss or hot gas cooling) for the supply\nof cold gas to early-type galaxies may play a significant role in the residual\nstar formation of early-type galaxies at a recent epoch.\n", "  NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched 11 February 2010 with 3\ninstruments on board, including the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).\nSince beginning normal operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has observed the Sun's\nentire visible disk almost continuously. HMI collects sequences of polarized\nfiltergrams taken at a fixed cadence with two 4096 x 4096 cameras from which\nare computed arcsecond-resolution maps of photospheric observables: the\nline-of-sight (LoS) velocity and magnetic field, continuum intensity, line\nwidth, line depth, and the Stokes polarization parameters, I Q U V, at 6\nwavelengths. Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science\nOperations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from\ncalibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the\nother, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s\ncadence. Corrections are made for static and temporally changing CCD\ncharacteristics, bad pixels, image alignment and distortion, polarization\nirregularities, filter-element uncertainty and non-uniformity, as well as\nSun-spacecraft velocity. This report explains issues affecting the resulting\nphysical quantities, describes the impact of regular updates to the instrument\ncalibration, and shows how the computations are optimized for actual HMI\nobservations. During the 5 years of the SDO prime mission, regular calibration\nsequences have been used to regularly improve and update the instrument\ncalibration and to monitor instrument changes. The instrument more than\nsatisfies the original specifications for data quality and continuity. The\nprocedures described here still have significant room for improvement. The most\nsignificant remaining systematic errors are associated with the spacecraft\norbital velocity.\n", "  In this paper we give an explicit construction of unfolded equations for\nmassive higher spin supermultiplets of the minimal (1,0) supersymmetry in AdS_3\nspace. For that purpose we use an unfolded formulation for massive bosonic and\nfermionic higher spins and find supertransformations leaving appropriate set of\nunfolded equations invariant. We provide two general supermultiplets (s, s+1/2)\nand (s, s-1/2) with arbitrary integer s, as well as a number of lower spin\nexamples.\n", "  We consider finite-time quantum quenches in the interacting\nTomonaga--Luttinger model, for example time-dependent changes of the\nnearest-neighbour interactions for spinless fermions. We use the exact\nsolutions for specific protocols including the linear and cosine ramps (or,\nmore generally, periodic pumping). We study the dynamics of the total and\nkinetic energy as well as the Green functions during as well as after the\nquench. For the latter we find that the light-cone picture remains applicable,\nhowever, the propagating front is delayed as compared to the sudden quench. We\nextract the universal behaviour of the Green functions and in particular\nprovide analytic, non-perturbative results for the delay applicable to quenches\nof short to moderate duration but arbitrary time dependency.\n", "  We reconsider the inclusive production of isolated prompt photons in $pp$\ncollisions at the LHC energies in the framework of $k_T$-factorization\napproach. Our analysis is based on the ${\\cal O}(\\alpha \\alpha_s)$ off-shell\n(depending on the transverse momenta of initial quarks and gluons) production\namplitudes of $q^* g^* \\to \\gamma q$ and $q^* \\bar q^* \\to \\gamma g$ partonic\nsubprocesses and transverse momentum dependent (or unintegrated) quark and\ngluon densities in a proton, which are chosen in accordance with the\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. We show that the sub-leading high-order\n${\\cal O}(\\alpha \\alpha_s^2)$ contributions, not covered by the non-collinear\nevolution of parton densities, are important to describe latest LHC data.\n", "  We report the first detection of a hot molecular core outside our Galaxy\nbased on radio observations with ALMA toward a high-mass young stellar object\n(YSO) in a nearby low metallicity galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).\nMolecular emission lines of CO, C17O, HCO+, H13CO+, H2CO, NO, SiO, H2CS, 33SO,\n32SO2, 34SO2, and 33SO2 are detected from a compact region (0.1 pc) associated\nwith a high-mass YSO, ST11. The temperature of molecular gas is estimated to be\nhigher than 100 K based on rotation diagram analysis of SO2 and 34SO2 lines.\nThe compact source size, warm gas temperature, high density, and rich molecular\nlines around a high-mass protostar suggest that ST11 is associated with a hot\nmolecular core. We find that the molecular abundances of the LMC hot core are\nsignificantly different from those of Galactic hot cores. The abundances of\nCH3OH, H2CO, and HNCO are remarkably lower compared with Galactic hot cores by\nat least 1-3 orders of magnitude. We suggest that these abundances are\ncharacterized by the deficiency of molecules whose formation requires the\nhydrogenation of CO on grain surfaces. In contrast, NO shows a high abundance\nin ST11 despite the notably low abundance of nitrogen in the LMC. A multitude\nof SO2 and its isotopologue line detections in ST11 imply that SO2 can be a key\nmolecular tracer of hot core chemistry in metal-poor environments. Furthermore,\nwe find molecular outflows around the hot core, which is the second detection\nof an extragalactic protostellar outflow. In this paper, we discuss physical\nand chemical characteristics of a hot molecular core in the low metallicity\nenvironment.\n", "  The recent diphoton excess at the LHC has been explained tentatively by a\nStandard Model (SM) singlet scalar of 750 GeV in mass, in the association of\nheavy particles with SM gauge charges. These new particles with various SM\ngauge charges induce loop-level couplings of the new scalar to $WW$, $ZZ$,\n$Z\\gamma$, $\\gamma\\gamma$, and $gg$. We show that the strength of the couplings\nto the gauge bosons also determines the production mechanism of the scalar\nparticle via $WW,\\, ZZ,\\, Z\\gamma,\\, \\gamma\\gamma,\\, gg$ fusion which leads to\nindividually distinguishable jet distributions in the final state where the\nstatistics will be improved in the ongoing run. The number of jets and the\nleading jet's transverse momentum distribution in the excess region of the\ndiphoton signal can be used to determine the coupling of the scalar to the\ngauge bosons arising from the protons which subsequently determine the charges\nof the heavy particles that arise from various well-motivated models.\n", "  We present a three-dimensional hybrid simulation of a collisionless\nperpendicular shock in a partially ionized plasma for the first time. In this\nsimulation, the shock velocity and the upstream ionization fraction are Vsh ~\n1333 km/s and fi ~ 0.5, that are typical values for isolated young supernova\nremnants in the interstellar medium. We confirm previous two-dimensional\nsimulation results that downstream hydrogen atoms leak into the upstream\nregion, they are accelerated by the pickup process in the upstream region, and\nlarge magnetic field fluctuations are generated both in the upstream and\ndownstream regions. In addition, we find that the magnetic field fluctuations\nhave three-dimensional structures and the leaking hydrogen atoms are injected\nto the diffusive shock acceleration at the perpendicular shock after the pickup\nprocess. The observed diffusive shock acceleration can be interpreted as the\nshock drift acceleration with scattering. Particles are accelerated to v ~ 100\nVsh ~ 0.3c within ~ 100 gyroperiods in this simulation. The acceleration time\nscale is faster than that of the diffusive shock acceleration in parallel\nshocks. Our simulation results suggest that supernova remnants can accelerate\ncosmic rays to 10^{15.5} eV (the knee) during the Sedov phase.\n", "  An onion-peeling technique is developed for inferring the emissivity profile\nof a stellarator plasma from a two-dimensional image acquired through a CCD or\nCMOS camera. Each pixel in the image is treated as an integral of emission\nalong a particular line-of-sight. Additionally, the flux surfaces in the plasma\nare partitioned into discrete layers, each of which is assumed to have uniform\nemissivity. If the topology of the flux surfaces is known, this construction\npermits the development of a system of linear equations that can be solved for\nthe emissivity of each layer. We present initial results of this method applied\nto wide-angle visible images of the CNT stellarator plasma.\n", "  To unveil a progenitor of the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream, we investigate\nthe interaction between an accreting satellite galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy\nusing an $N$-body simulation. A comprehensive parameter study with 247 models\nis performed by varying size and mass distribution of the progenitor dwarf\ngalaxy. We show that the binding energy of the progenitor is the crucial\nparameter in reproducing the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream and the shell-like\nstructures surrounding the Andromeda Galaxy. As a result of the simulations,\nthe progenitor must satisfy a simple scaling relation between the core radius,\nthe total mass and the tidal radius. Using this relation, we successfully\nconstrain the physical properties of the progenitors to have mass ranging from\n$5\\times10^8 M_\\odot$ to $5\\times10^9 M_\\odot$ and central surface density\naround $10^3\\, M_\\odot\\, \\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$. A detailed comparison between our\nresult and the nearby observed galaxies indicates that possible progenitors of\nthe Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream include a dwarf elliptical galaxy, a dwarf\nirregular galaxy, and a small spiral galaxy.\n", "  The localized-itinerant nature of Ce-4$f$ valence electrons in heavy fermion\ncompound CeIn$_{3}$ under pressure is studied thoroughly by means of the\ncombination of density functional theory and single-site dynamical mean-field\ntheory. The detailed evolutions of electronic structures of CeIn$_{3}$,\nincluding total and partial density of states, momentum-resolved spectral\nfunctions, and valence state histograms etc., are calculated in a wide pressure\nrange where the corresponding volume compression $V/V_0 \\in [0.6,1.0]$ (here\n$V_0$ is the experimental crystal volume) at $T \\cong 116$ K. Upon increasing\npressure, two strong peaks associated with the Ce-$4f$ states emerge near the\nFermi level, and the $c$-$f$ hybridization and valence state fluctuation are\nenhanced remarkably. Moreover, the kinetic and potential energies raise, while\nthe occupancy, total angular momentum, and low-energy scattering rate of the\nCe-$4f$ electrons decline with respect to pressure. All the physical\nobservables considered here exhibit prominent kinks or fluctuations in $V/V_0\n\\in [0.80,0.90]$, which are probably the desired fingerprints for the Ce-4$f$\nlocalized-itinerant crossover.\n", "  We describe development and application of a Global Astrometric Solution\n(GAS) to the problem of Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) astrometry. Current PS1 astrometry is\nbased on differential astrometric measurements using 2MASS reference stars,\nthus PS1 astrometry inherits the errors of the 2MASS catalog. The GAS, based on\na single, least squares adjustment to approximately 750k grid stars using over\n3000 extragalactic objects as reference objects, avoids this catalog-to-catalog\npropagation of errors to a great extent. The GAS uses a relatively small number\nof Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs, or distant AGN) with very accurate (<1 mas)\nradio positions, referenced to the ICRF2. These QSOs provide a hard constraint\nin the global least squares adjustment. Solving such a system provides absolute\nastrometry for all the stars simultaneously. The concept is much cleaner than\nconventional astrometry but is not easy to perform for large catalogs. In this\npaper we describe our method and its application to Pan-STARRS1 data. We show\nthat large-scale systematic errors are easily corrected but our solution\nresiduals for position (~60 mas) are still larger than expected based on\nsimulations (~10 mas). We provide a likely explanation for the reason the\nsmall-scale residual errors are not corrected in our solution as would be\nexpected.\n", "  To accurately predict the space weather effects of coronal mass ejection\n(CME) impacts at Earth one must know if and when a CME will impact Earth, and\nthe CME parameters upon impact. Kay et al. (2015b) presents Forecasting a CME's\nAltered Trajectory (ForeCAT), a model for CME deflections based on the magnetic\nforces from the background solar magnetic field. Knowing the deflection and\nrotation of a CME enables prediction of Earth impacts, and the CME orientation\nupon impact. We first reconstruct the positions of the 2008 April 10 and the\n2012 July 12 CMEs from the observations. The first of these CMEs exhibits\nsignificant deflection and rotation (34 degrees deflection and 58 degrees\nrotation), while the second shows almost no deflection or rotation (<3 degrees\neach). Using ForeCAT, we explore a range of initial parameters, such as the CME\nlocation and size, and find parameters that can successfully reproduce the\nbehavior for each CME. Additionally, since the deflection depends strongly on\nthe behavior of a CME in the low corona (Kay et al. (2015a, 2015b)), we are\nable to constrain the expansion and propagation of these CMEs in the low\ncorona.\n", "  We report on the detection of excess hard X-ray emission from the TeV BL Lac\nobject Mrk421 during the historical low-flux state of the source in January\n2013. NuSTAR observations were conducted four times between MJD56294 and\nMJD56312 with a total exposure of 80.9 ksec. The source flux in the 3-40 keV\nrange was nearly constant except for MJD56307, when the average flux level\nincreased by a factor of three. Throughout the exposure, the X-ray spectra of\nMrk421 were well represented by a steep power-law model with a photon index of\n3.1, although a significant excess was noted above 20 keV in the MJD56302 data\nwhen the source was in its faintest state. Moreover, Mrk421 was detected at\nmore than the 4-sigma level in the 40-79 keV count maps for both MJD56307 and\nMJD56302 but not during the remaining two observations. The detected excess\nhard X-ray emissions connect smoothly with the extrapolation of the high-energy\ngamma-ray continuum of the blazar constrained by Fermi-LAT during the source\nquiescence. These findings indicate that, while the overall X-ray spectrum of\nMrk421 is dominated by the highest-energy tail of the synchrotron continuum,\nthe variable excess hard X-ray emission above 20 keV (on the timescale of a\nweek) is related to the inverse Compton emission component. We discuss the\nresulting constraints on the variability and spectral properties of the\nlow-energy segment of the electron energy distribution in the source.\n", "  The effective electrostatic interaction between a pair of colloids, both of\nthem located close to each other at an electrolyte interface, is studied by\nemploying the full, nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory within classical\ndensity functional theory. Using a simplified yet appropriate model, all\ncontributions to the effective interaction are obtained exactly, albeit\nnumerically. The comparison between our results and those obtained within\nlinearized PB theory reveals that the latter overestimates these contributions\nsignificantly at short inter-particle separations. Whereas the surface\ncontributions to the linear and the nonlinear PB results differ only\nquantitatively, the line contributions show qualitative differences at short\nseparations. Moreover, a dependence of the line contribution on the solvation\nproperties of the two adjacent fluids is found, which is absent within the\nlinear theory. Our results are expected to enrich the understanding of\neffective interfacial interactions between colloids.\n", "  The solar diameter has been monitored at the Royal Observatory of the Spanish\nNavy (today the Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada: ROA) almost\ncontinuously since its creation in 1753 (i.e. during the last quarter of a\nmillennium). After a painstaking effort to collect data in the historical\narchive of this institution, we present here the data of the solar semidiameter\nfrom 1773 to 2006, making up an extensive new database for solar-radius\nmeasurements can be considered. We have calculated the solar semidiameter from\nthe transit times registered by the observers (except values of the solar\nradius from the modern Danjon astrolabe, which were published by ROA). These\ndata were analysed to reveal any significant long-term trends, but no such\ntrends were found. Therefore, the data sample confirms the constancy of the\nsolar diameter during the last quarter of a millennium (approximately) within\ninstrumental and methodological limits. Moreover, no relationship between solar\nradius and the new sunspot-number index has been found from measurements of the\nROA. Finally, the mean value for solar semidiameter (with one standard\ndeviation) calculated from the observations made in the ROA (1773-2006), after\napplying corrections by refraction and diffraction, is equal to 958.87\" \\pm\n1.77\"\n", "  We analyze Yukawa unification in the the context of $E_8\\times E_8$ heterotic\nCalabi-Yau models which rely on breaking to a GUT theory via a non-flat gauge\nbundle and subsequent Wilson line breaking to the standard model. Our focus is\non underlying GUT theories with gauge group $SU(5)$ or $SO(10)$. We provide a\ndetailed analysis of the fact that, in contrast to traditional field theory\nGUTs, the underlying GUT symmetry of these models does not enforce Yukawa\nunification. Using this formalism, we present various scenarios where Yukawa\nunification can occur as a consequence of additional symmetries. These\nadditional symmetries arise naturally in some heterotic constructions and we\npresent an explicit heterotic line bundle model which realizes one of these\nscenarios.\n", "  Using the UltraVISTA DR1 and 3D-HST catalogs, we construct a\nstellar-mass-complete sample, unique for its combination of surveyed volume and\ndepth, to study the evolution of the fractions of quiescent galaxies,\nmoderately unobscured star-forming galaxies, and dusty star-forming galaxies as\na function of stellar mass over the redshift interval $0.2 \\le z \\le 3.0$. We\nshow that the role of dusty star-forming galaxies within the overall galaxy\npopulation becomes more important with increasing stellar mass, and grows\nrapidly with increasing redshift. Specifically, dusty star-forming galaxies\ndominate the galaxy population with $\\log{(M_{\\rm star}/M_{\\odot})} \\gtrsim\n10.3$ at $z\\gtrsim2$. The ratio of dusty and non-dusty star-forming galaxies as\na function of stellar mass changes little with redshift. Dusty star-forming\ngalaxies dominate the star-forming population at $\\log{(M_{\\rm\nstar}/M_{\\odot})} \\gtrsim 10.0-10.5$, being a factor of $\\sim$3-5 more common,\nwhile unobscured star-forming galaxies dominate at $\\log{(M_{\\rm\nstar}/M_{\\odot})} \\lesssim 10$. At $\\log{(M_{\\rm star}/M_{\\odot})} > 10.5$, red\ngalaxies dominate the galaxy population at all redshift $z<3$, either because\nthey are quiescent (at late times) or dusty star-forming (in the early\nuniverse).\n", "  We present a positive correlation between the mass of dense molecular gas\n($M_{\\rm dense}$) of $\\sim 100$ pc scale circumnuclear disks (CNDs) and the\nblack hole mass accretion rate ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$) in total 10 Seyfert\ngalaxies, based on data compiled from the literature and an archive (median\naperture $\\theta_{\\rm med}$ = 220 pc). A typical $M_{\\rm dense}$ of CNDs is\n10$^{7-8}$ $M_\\odot$, estimated from the luminosity of the dense gas tracer,\nthe HCN($1-0$) emission line. Because dense molecular gas is the site of star\nformation, this correlation is virtually equivalent to the one between nuclear\nstar formation rate and $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$ revealed previously. Moreover, the\n$M_{\\rm dense}-\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$ correlation was tighter for CND-scale gas than\nfor the gas on kpc or larger scales. This indicates that CNDs likely play an\nimportant role in fueling black holes, whereas $>$kpc scale gas does not. To\ndemonstrate a possible approach for studying the CND-scale accretion process\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we used a mass\naccretion model where angular momentum loss due to supernova explosions is\nvital. Based on the model prediction, we suggest that only the partial fraction\nof the mass accreted from the CND ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$) is consumed as\n$\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$. However, $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ agrees well with the total\nnuclear mass flow rate (i.e., $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}$ + outflow rate). Although\nthese results are still tentative with large uncertainties, they support the\nview that star formation in CNDs can drive mass accretion onto supermassive\nblack holes in Seyfert galaxies.\n", "  We present a measurement of H2O ice crystallinity on the surface of\ntrans-neptunian objects (TNOs) with near-infrared narrow-band imaging. The\nnewly developed photometric technique allows us to efficiently determine the\nstrength of an 1.65-um absorption feature in crystalline H2O ice. Our data for\nthree large objects, Haumea, Quaoar, and Orcus, which are known to contain\ncrystalline H2O ice on the surfaces, show a reasonable result with high\nfractions of the crystalline phase. It can also be pointed out that if the\nH2O-ice grain size is larger than ~20 um, the crystallinities of these objects\nare obviously below 1.0, which suggest the presence of the amorphous phase.\nEspecially, Orcus exhibits a high abundance of amorphous H2O ice compared to\nHaumea and Quaoar, possibly indicating a correlation between bulk density of\nthe bodies and surface crystallization degree. We also found the presence of\ncrystalline H2O ice on Typhon and 2008 AP129, both of which are smaller than\nthe minimum size limit for inducing cryovolcanism as well as a transition from\namorphous to crystalline through the thermal evolution due to the decay of\nlong-lived isotopes.\n", "  The statistical examination of solar flares is crucial to revealing their\nglobal characteristics and behaviour. Such examinations can tackle large-scale\nscience questions or give context to detailed single-event studies. However,\nthey are often performed using standard but basic flare detection algorithms\nrelying on arbitrary thresholds. This arbitrariness may lead to important\nscientific conclusions being drawn from results caused by subjective choices in\nalgorithms rather than the true nature of the Sun. In this paper, we explore\nthe effect of the arbitrary thresholds used in the GOES (Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite) event list and LYRA (Large Yield\nRAdiometer) Flare Finder algorithms. We find that there is a small but\nsignificant relationship between the power law exponent of the GOES flare peak\nflux frequency distribution and the flare start thresholds of the algorithms.\nWe also find that the power law exponents of these distributions are not\nstable, but appear to steepen with increasing peak flux. This implies that the\nobserved flare size distribution may not be a power law at all. We show that\ndepending on the true value of the exponent of the flare size distribution,\nthis deviation from a power law may be due to flares missed by the flare\ndetection algorithms. However, it is not possible determine the true exponent\nfrom GOES/XRS observations. Additionally we find that the PROBA2/LYRA flare\nsize distributions are artificially steep and clearly non-power law. We show\nthat this is consistent with an insufficient degradation correction. This means\nthat PROBA2/LYRA should not be used for flare statistics or energetics unless\ndegradation is adequately accounted for. However, it can be used to study\nvariations over shorter timescales and for space weather monitoring.\n", "  We use UV spectral observations of active regions with the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) to investigate the properties of the coronal FeXII\n1349.4A emission at unprecedented high spatial resolution (~0.33\"). We find\nthat by using appropriate observational strategies (i.e., long exposures,\nlossless compression), FeXII emission can be studied with IRIS at high spatial\nand spectral resolution, at least for high density plasma (e.g., post-flare\nloops, and active region moss). We find that upper transition region (moss)\nFeXII emission shows very small average Doppler redshifts (v_Dop ~3 km/s), as\nwell as modest non-thermal velocities (with an average ~24 km/s, and the peak\nof the distribution at ~15 km/s). The observed distribution of Doppler shifts\nappears to be compatible with advanced 3D radiative MHD simulations in which\nimpulsive heating is concentrated at the transition region footpoints of a hot\ncorona. While the non-thermal broadening of FeXII 1349.4A peaks at similar\nvalues as lower resolution simultaneous Hinode/EIS measurements of FeXII 195A,\nIRIS observations show a previously undetected tail of increased non-thermal\nbroadening that might be suggestive of the presence of subarcsecond heating\nevents. We find that IRIS and EIS non-thermal line broadening measurements are\naffected by instrumental effects that can only be removed through careful\nanalysis. Our results also reveal an unexplained discrepancy between observed\n195.1/1349.4A FeXII intensity ratios and those predicted by the CHIANTI atomic\ndatabase.\n", "  During the past decade, several studies reported a correlation between\nchemical abundances of stars and condensation temperature (also known as Tc\ntrend). However, the real astrophysical nature of this correlation is still\ndebated. The main goal of this work is to explore the possible dependence of\nthe Tc trend on stellar Galactocentric distances, Rmean. We used high-quality\nspectra of about 40 stars observed with the HARPS and UVES spectrographs to\nderive precise stellar parameters, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. A\ndifferential line-by-line analysis was applied to achieve the highest possible\nprecision in the chemical abundances. We confirm previous results that [X/Fe]\nabundance ratios depend on stellar age and that for a given age, some elements\nalso show a dependence on Rmean. When using the whole sample of stars, we\nobserve a weak hint that the Tc trend depends on Rmean. The observed dependence\nis very complex and disappears when only stars with similar ages are\nconsidered. To conclude on the possible dependence of the Tc trend on the\nformation place of stars, a larger sample of stars with very similar\natmospheric parameters and stellar ages observed at different Galactocentric\ndistances is needed\n", "  We study a proof-of-principle example of the recently proposed hybrid\nquantum-classical simulation of strongly correlated fermion models in the\nthermodynamic limit. In a \"two-site\" dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)\napproach we reduce the Hubbard model to an effective impurity model subject to\nself-consistency conditions. The resulting minimal two-site representation of\nthe non-linear hybrid setup involves four qubits implementing the impurity\nproblem, plus an ancilla qubit on which all measurements are performed. We\noutline a possible implementation with superconducting circuits feasible with\nnear-future technology.\n", "  In this work, we study the effects of magnetic fields and rotation on the\nstructure and composition of proto-neutron stars (PNS's). A hadronic chiral\nSU(3) model is applied to cold neutron stars (NS) and proto-neutron stars with\ntrapped neutrinos and at fixed entropy per baryon. We obtain general\nrelativistic solutions for neutron and proto-neutron stars endowed with a\npoloidal magnetic field by solving Einstein-Maxwell field equations in a\nself-consistent way. As the neutrino chemical potential decreases in value over\ntime, this alters the chemical equilibrium and the composition inside the star,\nleading to a change in the structure and in the particle population of these\nobjects. We find that the magnetic field deforms the star and significantly\nalters the number of trapped neutrinos in the stellar interior, together with\nstrangeness content and temperature in each evolution stage.\n", "  The \"memory effect\" is the permanent change in the relative separation of\ntest particles resulting from the passage of gravitational radiation. We\ninvestigate the memory effect for a general, spatially flat FLRW cosmology by\nconsidering the radiation associated with emission events involving\nparticle-like sources. We find that if the resulting perturbation is decomposed\ninto scalar, vector, and tensor parts, only the tensor part contributes to\nmemory. Furthermore, the tensor contribution to memory depends only on the\ncosmological scale factor at the source and observation events, not on the\ndetailed expansion history of the universe. In particular, for sources at the\nsame luminosity distance, the memory effect in a spatially flat FLRW spacetime\nis enhanced over the Minkowski case by a factor of $(1 + z)$.\n", "  Ample observational capabilities exist today to detect the small density\nperturbations that low-mass dark matter subhaloes impart on stellar streams\nfrom disrupting Galactic satellites. In anticipation of these observations, we\ninvestigate the expected number and size of gaps by combining an analytic\nprescription for gap evolution on circular orbits with the flux of subhaloes\nnear the stream. We explore the distribution of gap sizes and depths for a\ntypical cold stream around the Milky Way and find that for a given stream age\nand gap depth, each subhalo mass produces a characteristic gap size. For a\nstream with an age of a few Gyr, orbiting at a distance of 10-20 kpc from the\nGalactic center, even modest subhaloes with a mass of $10^6-10^7 M_\\odot$\nproduce gaps with sizes that are on the order of several degrees. We consider\nthe number and distribution of gap sizes created by subhaloes with masses\n$10^5-10^9 M_\\odot$, accounting for the expected depletion of subhaloes by the\nMilky Way disk, and present predictions for six cold streams around the Milky\nWay. For Pal 5, we forecast 0.7 gaps with a density depletion of at least 25\\%\nand a typical gap size of $8^\\circ$. Thus, there appears to be {\\it no tension}\nbetween the recent non-detection of density depletions in the Pal 5 tidal tails\nand $\\Lambda$CDM expectations. These predictions can be used to guide the scale\nof future gap searches.\n", "  The supernova impostor PSN J09132750+7627410 in NGC 2748 reached a maximum\nluminosity of approximately -14 mag. It was quickly realized that its was not a\ntrue supernova, but another example of a non-terminal giant eruption. PSN\nJ09132750+7627410 is distinguished by multiple P Cygni absorption minima in the\nBalmer emission lines that correspond to outflow velocities of -400, -1100, and\n-1600 km/s. Multiple outflows have been observed in only a few other objects.\nIn this paper we describe the evolution of the spectrum and the P Cygni\nprofiles for three months past maximum, the post-maximum formation of a cool,\ndense wind, and the identification of a possible progenitor. One of the\npossible progenitors is an infrared source. Its pre-eruption spectral energy\ndistribution suggests a bolometric luminosity of -8.3 mag and a dust\ntemperature of 780 degrees K. If it is the progenitor it is above the AGB limit\nunlike the intermediate luminosity red transients. The three P Cygni profiles\ncould be due to ejecta from the current eruption, the wind of the progenitor,\nor previous mass loss events. We suggest that they were all formed as part of\nthe same high mass loss event and are due to material ejected at different\nvelocities or energies. We also suggest that multiple outflows during giant\neruptions may be more common than reported.\n", "  The bulk properties of spherically symmetric stars in general relativity can\nbe obtained by integrating the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. In\nprevious work we developed a \"post-TOV\" formalism - inspired by parametrized\npost-Newtonian theory - which allows us to classify in a parametrized,\nphenomenological form all possible perturbative deviations from the structure\nof compact stars in general relativity that may be induced by modified gravity\nat second post-Newtonian order. In this paper we extend the formalism to deal\nwith the stellar exterior, and we compute several potential astrophysical\nobservables within the post-TOV formalism: the surface redshift $z_s$, the\napparent radius $R_{\\rm app}$, the Eddington luminosity at infinity $L_{\\rm\nE}^\\infty$ and the orbital frequencies. We show that, at leading order, all of\nthese quantities depend on just two post-TOV parameters $\\mu_1$ and $\\chi$, and\nwe discuss the possibility to measure (or set upper bounds on) these\nparameters.\n", "  We present first predictions of the cross sections and differential\ndistributions for the central exclusive reaction $pp \\to pp \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}\n\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ being studied at RHIC and LHC. The amplitudes for the\nprocesses are formulated in terms of the tensor pomeron and tensor $f_{2 R}$\nreggeon exchanges with the vertices respecting the standard crossing and\ncharge-conjugation relations of Quantum Field Theory. The $\\sigma \\sigma$ and\n$\\rho \\rho$ contributions to the $\\pi^{+} \\pi^{-} \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ final state\nare considered focussing on their specificities. The correct inclusion of the\npomeron spin structure seems crucial for the considered sequential mechanisms\nin particular for the $\\rho\\rho$ contribution which is treated here for the\nfirst time. The mechanism considered gives a significant contribution to the\n$pp \\to pp \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-} \\pi^{+} \\pi^{-}$ reaction. We adjust parameters of\nour model to the CERN-ISR experimental data and present several predictions for\nthe STAR, ALICE, ATLAS and CMS experiments. A measurable cross section of order\nof a few $\\mu b$ is obtained including the experimental cuts relevant for the\nLHC experiments. We show the influence of the experimental cuts on the\nintegrated cross section and on various differential distributions.\n", "  Massive scalar fields can form long-lived configurations around black holes.\nThese configurations, dubbed quasi-bound states, have been studied both in the\nlinear and nonlinear regimes. In this paper we show that quasi-bound states can\nform in a dynamical scenario in which the mass of the black hole grows\nsignificantly due to the capture of infalling matter. We solve the Klein-Gordon\nequation numerically in spherical symmetry, mimicking the evolution of the\nspacetime through a sequence of analytic Schwarzschild black hole solutions of\nincreasing mass. It is found that the frequency of oscillation of the\nquasi-bound states decreases as the mass of the black hole increases. In\naddition, accretion leads to a significative increase of the exponential decay\nof the scalar field energy due to the presence of terms of order higher than\nlinear in the exponent. We compare the black hole mass growth rates used in our\nstudy with estimates from observational surveys and extrapolate our results to\nvalues of the scalar field masses consistent with models that propose scalar\nfields as dark matter in the universe. We show that even for unrealistically\nlarge mass accretion rates, quasi-bound states around accreting black holes can\nsurvive for cosmological timescales. Our results provide further support to the\nintriguing possibility of the existence of dark matter halos based on\n(ultra-light) scalar fields surrounding supermassive black holes in galactic\ncenters.\n", "  Accelerating dynamics from Born-Infeld-$f(R)$ gravity are studied in a\nsimplified conformal approach without matter. Explicit unification of inflation\nwith late-time acceleration is realized within this singular inflation\napproach, which is similar to Odintsov-Oikonomou singular $f(R)$ inflation. Our\nmodel turns out to be consistent with the latest release of Planck data.\n", "  In February 2016 the first observation of gravitational waves were reported.\nThe source of this event, denoted as GW150914, was identified as the merger of\ntwo black holes with a about 30 solar masses each, at a distance of\napproximately 400Mpc. These data where deduced using the Theory of General\nRelativity. Since 2009 a modified theory was proposed which adds near massive\nobjects phenomenologically the contribution of a dark energy, whose origin are\nvacuum uctuations. The dark energy accumulates toward smaller distances,\nreducing effec- tively the gravitational constant. In this contribution we show\nthat as a consequence the deduces chirping mass and the luminosity distance are\nlarger. This result suggests that the black hole merger corresponds to two\nmassive black holes near the center of primordial galaxies at large luminosity\ndistance, i.e. large redshifts.\n", "  We use the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey dataset to\nperform spatially resolved measurements of star cluster formation efficiency\n($\\Gamma$), the fraction of stellar mass formed in long-lived star clusters. We\nuse robust star formation history and cluster parameter constraints, obtained\nthrough color-magnitude diagram analysis of resolved stellar populations, to\nstudy Andromeda's cluster and field populations over the last $\\sim$300 Myr. We\nmeasure $\\Gamma$ of 4-8% for young, 10-100 Myr old populations in M31. We find\nthat cluster formation efficiency varies systematically across the M31 disk,\nconsistent with variations in mid-plane pressure. These $\\Gamma$ measurements\nexpand the range of well-studied galactic environments, providing precise\nconstraints in an HI-dominated, low intensity star formation environment.\nSpatially resolved results from M31 are broadly consistent with previous trends\nobserved on galaxy-integrated scales, where $\\Gamma$ increases with increasing\nstar formation rate surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$). However, we can\nexplain observed scatter in the relation and attain better agreement between\nobservations and theoretical models if we account for environmental variations\nin gas depletion time ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{dep}}$) when modeling $\\Gamma$,\naccounting for the qualitative shift in star formation behavior when\ntransitioning from a H$_2$-dominated to a HI-dominated interstellar medium. We\nalso demonstrate that $\\Gamma$ measurements in high $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$\nstarburst systems are well-explained by $\\tau_{\\mathrm{dep}}$-dependent\nfiducial $\\Gamma$ models.\n", "  We present near-infrared integral-field spectroscopic observations targeting\nH$\\alpha$ in eight sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z$=1.3-2.5 using\nVLT/SINFONI, obtaining significant detections for six of them. The star\nformation rates derived from the H$\\alpha$ emission are $\\sim$100\nM$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$, which account for only $\\sim$ 20-30\\% of the\ninfrared-derived values, thus suggesting that these systems are very dusty. Two\nof these systems present [NII]/H$\\alpha$ ratios indicative of the presence of\nan Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). We mapped the spatial distribution and\nkinematics of the star forming regions in these galaxies on kpc-scales. In\ngeneral, the H$\\alpha$ morphologies tend to be highly irregular and/or clumpy,\nshowing spatial extents of $\\sim$3-11~kpc. We find evidence for significant\nspatial offsets, of $\\sim$0.1-0.4$\"$ or 1.2-3.4 kpc, between the H$\\alpha$ and\nthe continuum emission in three of the sources. Performing a kinemetry analysis\nwe conclude that the majority of the sample is not consistent with disk-like\nrotation-dominated kinematics. Instead, they tend to show irregular and/or\nclumpy and turbulent velocity and velocity dispersion fields. This can be\ninterpreted as evidence for scenario in which these extreme star formation\nepisodes are triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions and major mergers. In\ncontrast to recent results for SMGs, these sources appear to follow the same\nrelations between gas and star forming rate densities as less luminous and/or\nnormal star forming galaxies.\n", "  Several experimental efforts such as material investigation and structure\nimprovement have been made recently to find a large anomalous Nernst effect in\nferromagnetic metals. Here, we develop a theory of spin transport driven by the\nanomalous Nernst effect in a diffusive ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic multilayer.\nStarting from a phenomenological formula of a spin-dependent electric current,\nthe theoretical formulas of electric voltage and spin torque generated by the\nanomalous Nernst effect are derived. The magnitude of the electric voltage\ngenerated from the spin current via the inverse spin Hall effect is on the\norder of $0.1$ $\\mu$V for currently available experimental parameter values.\nThe temperature gradient necessary to switch the magnetization is quite larger\nthan the typical experimental value. The separation of the contributions of the\nSeebeck and transverse spin Seebeck effects is also discussed.\n", "  The null energy condition can be violated stably in generalized Galileon\ntheories, which gives rise to the possibilities of healthy non-singular\ncosmologies. However, it has been reported that in many cases cosmological\nsolutions are plagued with instabilities or have some pathologies somewhere in\nthe whole history of the universe. Recently, this was shown to be generically\ntrue in a certain subclass of the Horndeski theory. In this short paper, we\nextend this no-go argument to the full Horndeski theory, and show that\nnon-singular models (with flat spatial sections) in general suffer either from\ngradient instabilities or some kind of pathology in the tensor sector. This\nimplies that one must go beyond the Horndeski theory to implement healthy\nnon-singular cosmologies.\n", "  The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) enabled\nthe search for the first galaxies observed at z ~ 8 - 11 (500 - 700 Myr after\nthe Big Bang). To continue quantifying the number density of the most luminous\ngalaxies (M_AB ~ -22.0) at the earliest epoch observable with HST, we search\nfor z ~ 10 galaxies (F125W-dropouts) in archival data from the Brightest of\nReionizing Galaxies (BoRG[z8]) survey, originally designed for detection of z ~\n8 galaxies (F098M-dropouts). By focusing on the deepest 293 arcmin^2 of the\ndata along 62 independent lines of sight, we identify six z ~ 10 candidates\nsatisfying the color selection criteria, detected at S/N > 8 in F160W with M_AB\n= -22.8 to -21.1 if at z = 10. Three of the six sources, including the two\nbrightest, are in a single WFC3 pointing (~ 4 arcmin^2), suggestive of\nsignificant clustering, which is expected from bright galaxies at z ~ 10.\nHowever, the two brightest galaxies are too extended to be likely at z ~ 10,\nand one additional source is unresolved and possibly a brown dwarf. The\nremaining three candidates have m_AB ~ 26, and given the area and completeness\nof our search, our best estimate is a number density of sources that is\nmarginally higher but consistent at 2{\\sigma} with searches in legacy fields.\nOur study highlights that z ~ 10 searches can yield a small number of\ncandidates, making tailored follow-ups of HST pure-parallel observations viable\nand effective.\n", "  We present Murchison Widefield Array observations of the supernova remnant\n(SNR) 1987A between 72 and 230 MHz, representing the lowest frequency\nobservations of the source to date. This large lever arm in frequency space\nconstrains the properties of the circumstellar medium created by the progenitor\nof SNR 1987A when it was in its red supergiant phase. As of late-2013, the\nradio spectrum of SNR 1987A between 72 MHz and 8.64 GHz does not show any\ndeviation from a non-thermal power-law with a spectral index of $-0.74 \\pm\n0.02$. This spectral index is consistent with that derived at higher\nfrequencies, beneath 100 GHz, and with a shock in its adiabatic phase. A\nspectral turnover due to free-free absorption by the circumstellar medium has\nto occur below 72 MHz, which places upper limits on the optical depth of $\\leq$\n0.1 at a reference frequency of 72 MHz, emission measure of $\\lesssim$ 13,000\ncm$^{-6}$ pc, and an electron density of $\\lesssim$ 110 cm$^{-3}$. This upper\nlimit on the electron density is consistent with the detection of prompt radio\nemission and models of the X-ray emission from the supernova. The electron\ndensity upper limit implies that some hydrodynamic simulations derived a red\nsupergiant mass loss rate that is too high, or a wind velocity that is too low.\nThe mass loss rate of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and wind\nvelocity of 10 km s$^{-1}$ obtained from optical observations are consistent\nwith our upper limits, predicting a current turnover frequency due to free-free\nabsorption between 5 and 60 MHz.\n", "  Based on a sample of 79 local advanced merger (adv-merger) (U)LIRGs, we\nsearch for the evidence of quenching process by investigating the distributions\nof the star formation history indicators (EW(H$\\alpha$), EW(H$\\delta$$_A$) and\nD$_n(4000)$) on the NUV-r color-mass and SFR-$M_{\\ast}$ diagrams. The\ndistributions of the EW(H$\\alpha$) and D$_n(4000)$ on the NUV-r color-mass\ndiagram show clear trends that at a given stellar mass, galaxies with redder\nNUV-r colors have smaller EW(H$\\alpha$) and larger D$_n(4000)$. The reddest\nadv-merger (U)LIRGs close to the green valley have D$_n(4000)$$>1.4$ mostly. In\naddition, in the SFR-$M_{\\ast}$ diagram, as the SFR decreases, the\nEW(H$\\alpha$) decreases and the D$_n(4000)$ increases, implying that the\nadv-merger (U)LIRGs on the star formation main sequence have more evolved\nstellar populations than those above the main sequence. These results indicate\nthat a fraction of the adv-merger (U)LIRGs have already exhibited signs of\nfading from the starburst phase and that the NUV-r reddest adv-merger (U)LIRGs\nare likely at the initial stage of post-starbursts with age of $\\sim 1$ Gyr,\nwhich is consistent with the gas exhausting time-scales. Therefore, our results\noffer additional support for the fast evolutionary track from the blue cloud to\nthe red sequence.\n", "  The space telescope CoRoT has provided light curves of T Tauri stars\nbelonging to the star-forming region of NGC 2264 with unprecedented continuity\nand precision in the framework of a coordinated multi-wavelength observational\nproject. We perform spot modelling of the optical light curves of five\nweak-line T Tauri stars whose variability is dominated by starspots. We apply\ntwo-spot and evolving single spot models in the framework of a Bayesian Monte\nCarlo Markov Chain approach to derive the a posteriori distribution of the\nstarspot parameters and the inclination of the star rotation axis. We focus on\nthe rotation periods of the spots that can provide evidence for differential\nrotation in those stars. We find meaningful results in the case of three stars\nwith an inclination higher than 50 deg and a slow variation of the light curve\namplitude. The relative difference of the spot rotation periods ranges from\n0.02 to 0.05 that is 3-10 times larger than the amplitude of the differential\nrotation found in similar stars with Doppler imaging techniques. We conclude\nthat the intrinsic starspot evolution, although very slow, has a significant\nimpact on the determination of the differential rotation by means of our spot\nmodelling approach. We estimate typical timescales for the evolution of the\nstarspot pattern between about 20 and 50 rotation periods in our stars.\n", "  Electrons embedded in liquid $^3$He form mesoscopic bubbles with radii large\ncompared to the interatomic distance between $^3$He atoms, voids of\n$N_{bubble}\\approx 200$ $^3$He atoms, generating a negative ion with a large\neffective mass that scatters thermal excitations. We develop scattering theory\nof Bogoliubov quasiparticles by negative ions embedded in $^3$He-A that\nincorporates the broken symmetries of $^3$He-A, particularly time-reversal and\nmirror symmetry in a plane containing the chiral axis $\\hat{\\bf l}$. Multiple\nscattering by the ion potential, combined with Andreev scattering by the chiral\norder parameter, leads to a spectrum of Weyl Fermions bound to the ion that\nsupport a mass current circulating the electron bubble - the mesoscopic\nrealization of chiral edge currents in superfluid $^3$He-A films. A consequence\nis that electron bubbles embedded in $^3$He-A acquire angular momentum, ${\\bf\nL}\\approx -(N_{bubble}/2)\\hbar\\,\\hat{\\bf l}$, inherited from the chiral ground\nstate. We extend the scattering theory to calculate the forces on a moving\nelectron bubble, both the Stokes drag and a transverse force, ${\\bf F}_{W} =\n\\frac{e}{c}{\\bf v}\\times{\\bf B}_{W}$, defined by an effective magnetic field,\n${\\bf B}_{W}\\propto\\hat{\\bf l}$, generated by the scattering of thermal\nquasiparticles off the spectrum of Weyl Fermions bound to the moving ion. The\ntransverse force is responsible for the anomalous Hall effect for electron\nbubbles driven by an electric field reported by the RIKEN group. Our results\nfor the scattering cross section, drag and transverse forces on moving ions are\ncompared with experiments, and shown to provide a quantitative understanding of\nthe temperature dependence of the mobility and anomalous Hall angle for\nelectron bubbles in normal and superfluid $^3$He-A. We also discuss our results\nin relation to earlier theoretical work on negative ions in superfluid $^3$He.\n", "  We study the dependence of the number density and properties of quasars on\nthe background galaxy density using the currently largest spectroscopic\ndatasets of quasars and galaxies. We construct a galaxy number density field\nsmoothed over the variable smoothing scale of between approximately 10 and\n$20\\,h^{-1}$Mpc over the redshift range of $0.46<z<0.59$ using the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) Constant MASS (CMASS)\ngalaxies. The quasar sample is prepared from the SDSS I/II DR7. We examine the\ncorrelation of incidence of quasars with the large-scale background density and\ndependence of quasar properties such as bolometric luminosity, black hole mass,\nand Eddington ratio on the large-scale density. We find a monotonic correlation\nbetween the quasar number density and large-scale galaxy number density, which\nis fitted well with a power law relation, $n_Q\\propto\\rho_G^{0.618}$. We detect\nweak dependences of quasar properties on the large-scale density such as a\npositive correlation between black hole mass and density, and a negative\ncorrelation between luminosity and density. We discuss the possibility of using\nquasars as a tracer of large-scale structures at high redshifts, which may be\nuseful for studies of growth of structures in the high redshift universe.\n", "  Newly recognized effects of refractive scattering in the ionized interstellar\nmedium have broad implications for very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at\nextreme angular resolutions. Building upon work by Blandford & Narayan (1985),\nwe present a simplified, geometrical optics framework, which enables rapid,\nsemi-analytic estimates of refractive scattering effects. We show that these\nestimates exactly reproduce previous results based on a more rigorous\nstatistical formulation. We then derive new expressions for the\nscattering-induced fluctuations of VLBI observables such as closure phase, and\nwe demonstrate how to calculate the fluctuations for arbitrary quantities of\ninterest using a Monte Carlo technique.\n", "  We report linear polarization measurements of x rays emitted due to\ndielectronic recombination into highly charged krypton ions. The ions in the\nHe-like through O-like charge states were populated in an electron beam ion\ntrap with the electron beam energy adjusted to recombination resonances in\norder to produce $K\\alpha$ x rays. The x rays were detected with a newly\ndeveloped Compton polarimeter using a beryllium scattering target and 12\nsilicon x-ray detector diodes sampling the azimuthal distribution of the\nscattered x rays. The extracted degrees of linear polarization of several\ndielectronic recombination transitions agree with results of relativistic\ndistorted--wave calculations. We also demonstrate a high sensitivity of the\npolarization to the Breit interaction, which is remarkable for a medium-$Z$\nelement like krypton. The experimental results can be used for polarization\ndiagnostics of hot astrophysical and laboratory fusion plasmas.\n", "  Aims. We study a sample of eight B[e] stars with uncertain evolutionary\nstatus to shed light on the origin of their circumstellar dust.\n  Methods. We performed a diagnostic analysis on the spectral energy\ndistribution beyond infrared wavelengths, and conducted a census of neighboring\nregion of each target to ascertain its evolutionary status.\n  Results. In comparison to pre-main sequence Herbig stars, these B[e] stars\nshow equally substantial excess emission in the near-infrared, indicative of\nexistence of warm dust, but much reduced excess at longer wavelengths, so the\ndusty envelopes should be compact in size. Isolation from star-forming regions\nexcludes the possibility of their pre-main sequence status. Six of our targets,\nincluding HD 50138, HD 45677, CD-245721, CD-49 3441, MWC 623, and HD 85567,\nhave been previously considered as FS CMa stars, whereas HD 181615/6 and HD\n98922 are added to the sample by this work. We argue that the circumstellar\ngrains of these isolated B[e] stars, already evolved beyond the pre-main\nsequence phase, should be formed in situ. This is in contrast to Herbig stars,\nwhich inherit large grains from parental molecular clouds. It has been thought\nthat HD 98922, in particular, is a Herbig star because of its large infrared\nexcess, but we propose it being in a more evolved stage. Because dust condenses\nout of stellar mass loss in an inside-out manner, the dusty envelope is\nspatially confined, and anisotropic mass flows, or anomalous optical properties\nof tiny grains, lead to the generally low line-of-sight extinction toward these\nstars.\n", "  We have conducted an angular differential imaging survey with NIRC2 at Keck\nin search of close-in substellar companions to a sample of seven systems with\nconfirmed planetary-mass companions (PMCs) on wide orbits (>50 AU). These\nwide-separation PMCs pose significant challenges to all three possible\nformation mechanisms: core accretion plus scattering, disk instability, and\nturbulent fragmentation. We explore the possibility that these companions\nformed closer in and were scattered out to their present-day locations by\nsearching for other massive bodies at smaller separations. The typical\nsensitivity for this survey is \\Delta K ~ 12.5 at 1\". We identify eight\ncandidate companions, whose masses would reach as low as one Jupiter mass if\ngravitationally bound. From our multi-epoch astrometry we determine that seven\nof these are conclusively background objects, while the eighth near DH Tau is\nambiguous and requires additional monitoring. We rule out the presence of >7\nM$_{\\rm Jup}$ bodies in these systems down to 15 - 50 AU that could be\nresponsible for scattering. This result combined with the totality of evidence\nsuggests that dynamical scattering is unlikely to have produced this population\nof PMCs. We detect orbital motion from the companions ROXs 42B b and ROXs 12 b,\nand from this determine 95% upper limits on the companions' eccentricities of\n0.58 and 0.83 respectively. Finally, we find that the 95% upper limit on the\noccurrence rate of additional planets with masses between 5 - 15 M$_{\\rm Jup}$\noutside of 40 AU in systems with PMCs is 54%.\n", "  We investigate models of the Milky Way disc taking into account\nsimultaneously the bar and a two-armed quasi-static spiral pattern. Away from\nmajor resonance overlaps, the mean stellar radial motions in the plane are\nessentially a linear superposition of the isolated effects of the bar and\nspirals. Thus, provided the bar is strong enough, even in the presence of\nspiral arms, these mean radial motions are predominantly affected by the\nGalactic bar for large scale velocity fluctuations. This is evident when\ncomparing the peculiar line-of-sight velocity power spectrum of our coupled\nmodels with bar-only models. However, we show how forthcoming spectroscopic\nsurveys could disentangle bar-only non-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy from\nmodels in which spiral arms have a significant amplitude. We also point out\nthat overlaps of low-order resonances are sufficient to enhance stellar\nchurning within the disc, even when the spirals amplitude is kept constant.\nNevertheless, for churning to be truly non-local, stronger or (more likely)\ntransient amplitudes would be needed: otherwise the disc is actually mostly\nunaffected by churning in the present models. Finally, regarding vertical\nbreathing modes, the combined effect of the bar and spirals on vertical motions\nis a clear non-linear superposition of the isolated effects of both components,\nsignificantly superseding the linear superposition of modes produced by each\nperturber separately, thereby providing an additional effect to consider when\nanalysing the observed breathing mode of the Galactic disc in the extended\nSolar neighbourhood.\n", "  With Gaussian expansion method (GEM), realistic wave functions are used to\ncalculate coupled-channel effects for the bottomonium under the framework of\n${}^3P_0$ model. The simplicity and accuracy of GEM are explained. We calculate\nthe mass shifts, probabilities of the $B$ meson continuum, $S-D$ mixing angles,\nstrong and dielectric decay widths. Our calculation shows that both $S-D$\nmixing and the $B$ meson continuum can contribute to the suppression of the\nvector meson's dielectric decay width. We suggest more precise measurements on\nthe radiative decays of $\\Upsilon(10580)$ and $\\Upsilon(11020)$ to distinguish\nthese two effects. The above quantities are also calculated with simple\nharmonic oscillator (SHO) wave function approximation for comparison. The\ndeviation between GEM and SHO indicates that it is essential to treat the wave\nfunctions accurately for near threshold states.\n", "  We study a class of non-local, action-based, and purely gravitational models.\nThese models seek to describe a cosmology in which inflation is driven by a\nlarge, bare cosmological constant that is screened by the self-gravitation\nbetween the soft gravitons that inflation rips from the vacuum. Inflation ends\nwith the universe poised on the verge of gravitational collapse, in an\noscillating phase of expansion and contraction that should lead to rapid\nreheating when matter is included. After the attainment of a hot, dense\nuniverse the nonlocal screening terms become constant as the universe evolves\nthrough a conventional phase of radiation domination. The onset of matter\ndomination triggers a much smaller anti-screening effect that could explain the\ncurrent phase of acceleration.\n", "  A microscopic approach that is based on the multisubband semiconductor Bloch\nequations formulated in the basis of a 14-band ${\\mathbf k} \\cdot {\\mathbf p}$\nmodel is employed to compute the temporal dynamics of photocurrents in GaAs\nquantum wells following the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses. This\napproach provides a transparent description of the interband, intersubband, and\nintraband excitations, fully includes all resonant as well as off-resonant\nexcitations, and treats the light-matter interaction non-perturbatively. For\nlinearly polarized excitations the photocurrents contain contributions from\nshift and rectification currents. We numerically compute and analyze these\ncurrents generated by the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses for [110]-\nand [111]-oriented GaAs quantum wells. It is shown that the often employed\nperturbative $\\chi^{(2)}$-approach breaks down for peak fields larger than\nabout 10~kV/cm and that non-perturbative effects lead to a reduction of the\npeak values of the shift and rectification currents and to temporal\noscillations which originate from Rabi flopping. In particular, we find a\ncomplex oscillatory photon energy dependence of the magnitudes of the shift and\nrectification currents. Our simulations demonstrate that this dependence is the\nresult of mixing between the heavy- and light-hole valence bands. This is a\nsurprising finding since the bandmixing has an even larger influence on the\nstrength of the photocurrents than the absorption coefficient. For\n[110]-oriented GaAs quantum wells the calculated photon energy dependence is\ncompared to experimental results and a good agreement is obtained which\nvalidates our theoretical approach.\n", "  We analyzed both HCN J=1-0 and HNC J=1-0 line profiles to study the inflow\nmotions in different evolutionary stages of massive star formation: 54 infrared\ndark clouds (IRDCs), 69 high-mass protostellar object (HMPOs), and 54\nultra-compact HII regions (UCHIIs). The inflow asymmetry in HCN spectra seems\nto be prevalent throughout all the three evolutionary phases, with IRDCs\nshowing the largest excess in blue profile. In the case of HNC spectra, the\nprevalence of blue sources does not appear, excepting for IRDCs. We suggest\nthat this line is not appropriate to trace inflow motion in evolved stages of\nmassive star formation because the abundance of HNC decreases at high\ntemperatures. This result spotlights the importance of considering chemistry in\nthe dynamics study of massive star-forming regions. The fact that the IRDCs\nshow the highest blue excess in both transitions indicates that the most active\ninflow occurs in the early phase of star formation, i.e., the IRDC phase rather\nthan in the later phases. However, mass is still inflowing onto some UCHIIs. We\nalso found that the absorption dips of the HNC spectra in 6 out of 7 blue\nsources are red-shifted relative to their systemic velocities. These\nred-shifted absorption dips may indicate global collapse candidates, although\nmapping observations with better resolution are needed to examine this feature\nin more detail.\n", "  We present a method of solution of the Bartels-Kwiecinski-Praszalowicz (BKP)\nequation based on the numerical integration of iterated integrals in transverse\nmomentum and rapidity space. As an application, our procedure, which makes use\nof Monte Carlo integration techniques, is applied to obtain the gluon Green\nfunction in the odderon case at leading order. The same approach can be used\nfor more complicated scenarios.\n", "  Radio galaxies are among the most massive galaxies in the high redshift\nuniverse and are known to often lie in protocluster environments. We have\nstudied the fields of seven z = 2.2 radio galaxies with HAWK-I narrow-band and\nbroad-band imaging in order to map out their environment using Halpha emitters\n(HAEs). The results are compared to the blank field HAE survey HiZELS. All of\nthe radio galaxy fields are overdense in HAEs relative to a typical HiZELS\nfield of the same area and four of the seven are richer than all except one of\n65 essentially random HiZELS subfields of the same size. The star formation\nrates of the massive HAEs are lower than those necessary to have formed their\nstellar population in the preceding Gyr - indicating that these galaxies are\nlikely to have formed the bulk of their stars at higher redshifts, and are\nstarting to quench.\n", "  We propose that the magnetosphere reconfiguration induced by magnetic twists\nin the closed field line region can account for the mode-switching of\nintermittent pulsars. We carefully investigate the properties of axisymmetric\nforce-free pulsar magnetospheres with magnetic twists in closed field line\nregion around the polar caps. The magnetosphere with twisted closed lines leads\nto enhanced spin-down rates. The enhancement in spin-down rate depends on the\nsize of region with twisted closed lines. Typically, it is increased by a\nfactor of $\\sim2$, which is consistent with the intermittent pulsars' spin down\nbehavior during the `off' and `on' states. We find there is a threshold of\nmaximal twist angle $\\Delta\\phi_{\\rm thres}\\sim1$. The magnetosphere is stable\nonly if the closed line twist angle is less than $\\Delta\\phi_{\\rm thres}$.\nBeyond this value, the magnetosphere becomes unstable and gets untwisted. The\nspin-down rate would reduce to its off-state value. The quasi-periodicity in\nspin-down rate change can be explained by long-term activities in star's crust\nand the untwisting induced by MHD instability. The estimated duration time of\non-state is about one week, consistent with observations. Due to the MHD\ninstability, there exists an upper limit for the spin down ratio ($f\\sim3$)\nbetween the on-state and the off-state, if the Y-point remains at the light\ncylinder.\n", "  The Kepler mission has revealed a great diversity of planetary systems and\narchitectures, but most of the planets discovered by Kepler orbit faint stars.\nUsing new data from the K2 mission, we present the discovery of a five planet\nsystem transiting a bright (V = 8.9, K = 7.7) star called HIP 41378. HIP 41378\nis a slightly metal-poor late F-type star with moderate rotation (v sin(i) = 7\nkm/s) and lies at a distance of 116 +/- 18 from Earth. We find that HIP 41378\nhosts two sub-Neptune sized planets orbiting 3.5% outside a 2:1 period\ncommensurability in 15.6 and 31.7 day orbits. In addition, we detect three\nplanets which each transit once during the 75 days spanned by K2 observations.\nOne planet is Neptune sized in a likely ~160 day orbit, one is sub-Saturn sized\nlikely in a ~130 day orbit, and one is a Jupiter sized planet in a likely ~1\nyear orbit. We show that these estimates for the orbital periods can be made\nmore precise by taking into account dynamical stability considerations. We also\ncalculate the distribution of stellar reflex velocities expected for this\nsystem, and show that it provides a good target for future radial velocity\nobservations. If a precise orbital period can be determined for the outer\nJovian planet through future observations, it will be an excellent candidate\nfor follow-up transit observations to study its atmosphere and measure its\noblateness.\n", "  The protostellar outflows of wide-separation forming binaries frequently\nappear misaligned. We use magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the\nalignment of protostellar spin and molecular outflows for forming binary pairs.\nWe show that the protostellar pairs, which form from turbulent fragmentation\nwithin a single parent core, have randomly oriented angular momenta. Although\nthe pairs migrate to closer separations, their spins remain partially\nmisaligned. We produce $^{12}$CO(2-1) synthetic observations of the simulations\nand characterize the outflow orientation in the emission maps. The\nCO-identified outflows exhibit a similar random distribution and are also\nstatistically consistent with the observed distribution of molecular outflows.\nWe conclude that observed misalignment provides a clear signature of binary\nformation via turbulent fragmentation. The persistence of misaligned outflows\nand stellar spins following dynamical evolution may provide a signature of\nbinary origins for more evolved multiple star systems.\n", "  We investigate mass segregation in group and cluster environments by\nidentifying galaxy analogues in high-resolution dark matter simulations.\nSubhalos identified by the AHF and ROCKSTAR halo finders have similar mass\nfunctions, independent of resolution, but different radial distributions due to\nsignificantly different subhalo hierarchies. We propose a simple way to\nclassify subhalos as galaxy analogues. The radial distributions of galaxy\nanalogues agree well at large halo-centric radii for both AHF and ROCKSTAR but\ndisagree near parent halo centres where the phase-space information used by\nROCKSTAR is essential.\n  We see clear mass segregation at small radii (within $0.5\\,r_{vir}$) with\naverage galaxy analogue mass decreasing with radius. Beyond the virial radius,\nwe find a mild trend where the average galaxy analogue mass increases with\nradius. These mass segregation trends are strongest in small groups and\ndominated by the segregation of low mass analogues. The lack of mass\nsegregation in massive galaxy analogues suggests that the observed trends are\ndriven by the complex accretion histories of the parent halos rather than\ndynamical friction.\n", "  A paradigmatic microswimmer is the three-linked-spheres model, which follows\na minimalist approach for propulsion by shape shifting. As such, it has been\nthe subject of numerous analytical and numerical studies. In this Rapid\nCommunication, an experimental three-linked-spheres swimmer is created by\nself-assembling ferromagnetic particles at an air-water interface. It is\npowered by a uniform oscillating magnetic field. A model, using two harmonic\noscillators, reproduces the experimental findings. Because the model remains\ngeneral, the same approach could be used to design a variety of efficient\nmicroswimmers.\n", "  Using radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmospheric\nlayers from the upper convection zone to the lower corona, we investigate the\nself-consistent excitation of slow magneto-acoustic body waves (slow modes) in\na magnetic flux concentration. We find that the convective downdrafts in the\nclose surroundings of a two-dimensional flux slab \"pump\" the plasma inside it\nin the downward direction. This action produces a downflow inside the flux\nslab, which encompasses ever higher layers, causing an upwardly propagating\nrarefaction wave. The slow mode, excited by the adiabatic compression of the\ndownflow near the optical surface, travels along the magnetic field in the\nupward direction at the tube speed. It develops into a shock wave at\nchromospheric heights, where it dissipates, lifts the transition region, and\nproduces an offspring in the form of a compressive wave that propagates further\ninto the corona. In the wake of downflows and propagating shock waves, the\natmosphere inside the flux slab in the chromosphere and higher tends to\noscillate with a period of $\\nu\\approx 4$~mHz. We conclude that this process of\n\"magnetic pumping\" is a most plausible mechanism for the direct generation of\nlongitudinal chromospheric and coronal compressive waves within magnetic flux\nconcentrations, and it may provide an important heat source in the\nchromosphere. It may also be responsible for certain types of dynamic fibrils.\n", "  We revisit the renormalization prescription for the quark-meson model in an\nextended mean-field approximation, where vacuum quark fluctuations are\nincluded. At a given cutoff scale the model parameters are fixed by fitting\nvacuum quantities, typically including the sigma-meson mass $m_\\sigma$ and the\npion decay constant $f_\\pi$. In most publications the latter is identified with\nthe expectation value of the sigma field, while for $m_\\sigma$ the curvature\nmass is taken. When quark loops are included, this prescription is however\ninconsistent, and the correct identification involves the renormalized pion\ndecay constant and the sigma pole mass. In the present article we investigate\nthe influence of the parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the\nmodel at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences\nbetween the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous\nmatter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous\nphases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization\nprescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects\non the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present\na well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity.\n", "  We used combined data from XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories to study the\nX-ray morphology of SNR G306.3-0.9. A spatially-resolved spectral analysis was\nused to obtain physical and geometrical parameters of different regions of the\nremnant. Spitzer infrared observations were also used to constrain the\nprogenitor supernova and study the environment in which the SNR evolved. The\nX-ray morphology of the remnant displays a non-uniform structure of\nsemi-circular appearance, with a bright southwest region and very weak or\nalmost negligible X-ray emission in its northern part. These results indicate\nthat the remnant is propagating in a non-uniform environment as the shock\nfronts are encountering a high-density medium, where enhanced infrared emission\nis detected. The X-ray spectral analysis of the selected regions shows distinct\nemission-line features of several metal elements, confirming the thermal origin\nof the emission. The X-ray spectra are well represented by a combination of two\nabsorbed thermal plasma models: one in equilibrium ionization with a mean\ntemperature of ~0.19 keV, and another out of equilibrium ionization at a higher\ntemperature of ~1.1 or 1.6-1.9 keV. For regions located in the northeast,\ncentral, and southwest part of the SNR, we found elevated abundances of Si, S,\nAr, Ca, and Fe, typical of ejecta material. The outer regions located northwest\nand south show values of the abundances above solar but lower than to those\nfound in the central regions. This suggests that the composition of the\nemitting outer parts of the SNR is a combination of ejecta and shocked material\nof the interstellar medium. The comparison between the S/Si, Ar/Si, and Ca/Si\nabundances ratios (1.75, 1.27, and 2.72 in the central region, respectively),\nfavor a Type Ia progenitor for this SNR, a result that is also supported by an\nindependent morphological analysis using X-ray and IR data.\n", "  We investigated 1234 fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars observed by the All Sky\nAutomated Survey (ASAS) to identify the Blazhko (BL) effect. A sample of 1547\nBL stars from the literature was collected to compare the modulation-period\ndistribution with stars newly identified in our sample. A classical frequency\nspectra analysis was performed using Period04 software. Data points from each\nstar from the ASAS database were analysed individually to avoid confusion with\nartificial peaks and aliases. Statistical methods were used in the\ninvestigation of the modulation-period distribution. Altogether we identified\n87 BL stars (48 new detections), 7 candidate stars, and 22 stars showing\nlong-term period variations. The distribution of modulation periods of newly\nidentified BL stars corresponds well to the distribution of modulation periods\nof stars located in the Galactic field, Galactic bulge, Large Magellanic Cloud,\nand globular cluster M5 collected from the literature. As a very important\nby-product of this comparison, we found that pulsation periods of BL stars\nfollow Gaussian distribution with the mean period of $0.54\\pm0.07$ d, while the\nmodulation periods show log-normal distribution with centre at $\\log(P_{\\rm\nm}~{\\rm [d]})=1.78\\pm0.30$ dex. This means that 99.7 % of all known modulated\nstars have BL periods between 7.6 and 478 days. We discuss the identification\nof long modulation periods and show, that a significant percentage of stars\nshowing long-term period variations could be classified as BL stars.\n", "  Energetic winds and radiation from massive star clusters push the surrounding\ngas and blow superbubbles in the interstellar medium (ISM). Using 1-D\nhydrodynamic simulations, we study the role of radiation in the dynamics of\nsuperbubbles driven by a young star cluster of mass $10^{6}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We\nhave considered a realistic time evolution of the mechanical power as well as\nradiation power of the star cluster, and detailed heating and cooling\nprocesses. We find that the ratio of the radiation pressure on the shell\n(shocked ISM) to the thermal pressure ($\\sim10^{7}$ K) of the shocked wind\nregion is almost independent of the ambient density, and it is greater than\nunity before $\\lesssim 1$ Myr. We explore the parameter space of density and\ndust opacity of the ambient medium, and find that the size of the hot gas\n($\\sim$ 10$^{7}$ K) cavity is insensitive to the dust opacity\n($\\sigma_{d}\\approx(0.1-1.5)\\times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{2}$), but the structure of\nthe photoionized ($\\sim10^4$ K) gas depends on it. Most of the radiative losses\noccur at $\\sim10^{4}$ K, with sub-dominant losses at $\\lesssim 10^3$ K and\n$\\sim10^{6}-10^{8}$ K. The superbubbles can retain as high as $\\sim 10\\%$ of\nits input energy, for an ambient density of $10^{3}\\,m{\\rm_{H}\\,cm^{-3}}$. We\ndiscuss the role of ionization parameter and recombination-averaged density in\nunderstanding the dominant feedback mechanism. Finally, we compare our results\nwith the observations of 30 Doradus.\n", "  The missing mass spectroscopy of the $^{7}_{\\Lambda}$He hypernucleus was\nperformed, using the $^{7}$Li$(e,e^{\\prime}K^{+})^{7}_{\\Lambda}$He reaction at\nthe Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility Hall C. The $\\Lambda$\nbinding energy of the ground state (1/2$^{+}$) was determined with a smaller\nerror than that of the previous measurement, being $B_{\\Lambda}$ = 5.55 $\\pm$\n0.10(stat.) $\\pm$ 0.11(sys.) MeV. The experiment also provided new insight into\ncharge symmetry breaking in p-shell hypernuclear systems. Finally, a peak at\n$B_{\\Lambda}$ = 3.65 $\\pm$ 0.20(stat.) $\\pm$ 0.11(sys.) MeV was observed and\nassigned as a mixture of 3/2$^{+}$ and 5/2$^{+}$ states, confirming the\n\"gluelike\" behavior of $\\Lambda$, which makes an unstable state in $^{6}$He\nstable against neutron emission.\n", "  It has been suggested that the GeV excess, observed from the region\nsurrounding the Galactic Center, might originate from a population of\nmillisecond pulsars that formed in globular clusters. With this in mind, we\nemploy the publicly available Fermi data to study the gamma-ray emission from\n157 globular clusters, identifying a statistically significant signal from 25\nof these sources (ten of which are not found in existing gamma-ray catalogs).\nWe combine these observations with the predicted pulsar formation rate based on\nthe stellar encounter rate of each globular cluster to constrain the gamma-ray\nluminosity function of millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's globular cluster\nsystem. We find that this pulsar population exhibits a luminosity function that\nis quite similar to those millisecond pulsars observed in the field of the\nMilky Way (i.e. the thick disk). After pulsars are expelled from a globular\ncluster, however, they continue to lose rotational kinetic energy and become\nless luminous, causing their luminosity function to depart from the\nsteady-state distribution. Using this luminosity function and a model for the\nglobular cluster disruption rate, we show that millisecond pulsars born in\nglobular clusters can account for only a few percent or less of the observed\nGeV excess. Among other challenges, scenarios in which the entire GeV excess is\ngenerated from such pulsars are in conflict with the observed mass of the Milky\nWay's Central Stellar Cluster.\n", "  We present a new approach aimed at constraining the typical size and optical\nproperties of carbon dust grains in Circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) of\ncarbon-rich stars (C-stars) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). To achieve\nthis goal, we apply our recent dust growth description, coupled with a\nradiative transfer code to the CSEs of C-stars evolving along the TP-AGB, for\nwhich we compute spectra and colors. Then we compare our modeled colors in the\nnear- and mid-infrared (NIR and MIR) bands with the observed ones, testing\ndifferent assumptions in our dust scheme and employing several data sets of\noptical constants for carbon dust available in the literature. Different\nassumptions adopted in our dust scheme change the typical size of the carbon\ngrains produced. We constrain carbon dust properties by selecting the\ncombination of grain size and optical constants which best reproduces several\ncolors in the NIR and MIR at the same time. The different choices of optical\nproperties and grain size lead to differences in the NIR and MIR colors greater\nthan two magnitudes in some cases. We conclude that the complete set of\nobserved NIR and MIR colors are best reproduced by small grains, with sizes\nbetween $\\sim$0.035 and $\\sim$0.12~$\\mu$m, rather than by large grains between\n$\\sim0.2$ and $0.7$~$\\mu$m. The inability of large grains to reproduce NIR and\nMIR colors seems independent of the adopted optical data set. We also find a\npossible trend of the grain size with mass-loss and/or carbon excess in the\nCSEs of these stars.\n", "  One of the most fundamental topics of exobiology concerns the identification\nof stars with environments consistent with life. Although it is believed that\nmost types of main-sequence stars might be able to support life, particularly\nextremophiles, special requirements appear to be necessary for the development\nand sustainability of advanced life forms. From our study, orange main-sequence\nstars, ranging from spectral type late-G to mid-K (with a maximum at early-K),\nare most promising. Our analysis considers a variety of aspects, including (1)\nthe frequency of the various types of stars, (2) the speed of stellar evolution\ntheir lifetimes, (3) the size of the stellar climatological habitable zones\n(CLI-HZs), (4) the strengths and persistence of their magnetic dynamo generated\nX-ray - UV emissions, and (5) the frequency and severity of flares, including\nsuperflares; both (4) and (5) greatly reduce the suitability of red dwarfs to\nhost life-bearing planets. The various phenomena show pronounced dependencies\non the stellar key parameters such as effective temperature and mass,\npermitting the assessment of the astrobiological significance of various types\nof stars. Thus, we developed a \"Habitable-Planetary-Real-Estate Parameter\"\n(HabPREP) that provides a measure for stars that are most suitable for planets\nwith life. Early K stars are found to have the highest HabPREP values,\nindicating they may be \"Goldilocks\" stars for life-hosting planets. Red dwarfs\nare numerous, having long lifetimes, but their narrow CLI-HZs and hazards from\nmagnetic activity make them less suitable for hosting exolife. Moreover, we\nprovide X-ray - FUV irradiances for G0 V - M5 V stars over a wide range of\nages.\n", "  Either bulk rotation or local turbulence is widely invoked to drive\nfragmentation in collapsing cores so as to produce multiple star systems. Even\nwhen the two mechanisms predict different manners in which the stellar spins\nand orbits are aligned, subsequent internal or external interactions can drive\nmultiple systems towards or away from alignment thus masking their formation\nprocess. Here, we demonstrate that the geometrical and dynamical relationship\nbetween the binary system and its surrounding bulk envelope provide the crucial\ndistinction between fragmentation models. We find that the circumstellar disks\nof the binary protostellar system L1551 IRS 5 are closely parallel not just\nwith each other but also with their surrounding flattened envelope.\nMeasurements of the relative proper motion of the binary components spanning\nnearly 30 yr indicate an orbital motion in the same sense as the envelope\nrotation. Eliminating orbital solutions whereby the circumstellar disks would\nbe tidally truncated to sizes smaller than are observed, the remaining\nsolutions favor a circular or low-eccentricity orbit tilted by up to\n$\\sim$25$^\\circ$ from the circumstellar disks. Turbulence-driven fragmentation\ncan generate local angular momentum to produce a coplanar binary system, but\nwhich bears no particular relationship with its surrounding envelope. Instead,\nthe observed properties conform with predictions for rotationally-driven\nfragmentation. If the fragments were produced at different heights or on\nopposite sides of the midplane in the flattened central region of a rotating\ncore, the resulting protostars would then exhibit circumstellar disks parallel\nwith the surrounding envelope but tilted from the orbital plane as is observed.\n", "  We present a general parameter study, in which the abundance of interstellar\nargonium (ArH$^+$) is predicted using a model for the physics and chemistry of\ndiffuse interstellar gas clouds. Results have been obtained as a function of UV\nradiation field, cosmic-ray ionization rate, and cloud extinction. No single\nset of cloud parameters provides an acceptable fit to the typical ArH$^+$,\nOH$^+$ and $\\rm H_2O^+$ abundances observed in diffuse clouds within the\nGalactic disk. Instead, the observed abundances suggest that ArH$^+$ resides\nprimarily in a separate population of small clouds of total visual extinction\nof at most 0.02 mag per cloud, within which the column-averaged molecular\nfraction is in the range $10^{-5} - 10^{-2}$, while OH$^+$ and $\\rm H_2O^+$\nreside primarily in somewhat larger clouds with a column-averaged molecular\nfraction $\\sim 0.2$. This analysis confirms our previous suggestion that the\nargonium molecular ion is a unique tracer of almost purely atomic gas.\n", "  The discovery of pure spinor formalism makes the computation of superstring\nscattering amplitudes possible. In this paper, we will illustrate how computer\nalgebra system Cadabra is used in computing the supersymmetric amplitude in\npure spinor formalism and provide the source code that computes the tree-level\nmassless 5-gluon amplitude.\n", "  Observations of coronal jets increasingly suggest that local fragmentation\nand intermittency play an important role in the dynamics of these events. In\nthis work we investigate this fragmentation in high-resolution simulations of\njets in the closed-field corona. We study two realizations of the\nembedded-bipole model, whereby impulsive helical outflows are driven by\nreconnection between twisted and untwisted field across the domed fan plane of\na magnetic null. We find that the reconnection region fragments following the\nonset of a tearing-like instability, producing multiple magnetic null points\nand flux-rope structures within the current layer. The flux ropes formed within\nthe weak-field region in the center of the current layer are associated with\n\"blobs\" of density enhancement that become filamentary threads as the flux\nropes are ejected from the layer, whereupon new flux ropes form behind them.\nThis repeated formation and ejection of flux ropes provides a natural\nexplanation for the intermittent outflows, bright blobs of emission, and\nfilamentary structure observed in some jets. Additional observational\nsignatures of this process are discussed. Essentially all jet models invoke\nreconnection between regions of locally closed and locally open field as the\njet-generation mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that this repeated tearing\nprocess should occur at the separatrix surface between the two flux systems in\nall jets. A schematic picture of tearing-mediated jet reconnection in three\ndimensions is outlined.\n", "  As a shock front interacts with turbulence, it develops corrugation which\ninduces outgoing wave modes in the downstream plasma. For a fast shock wave,\nthe incoming wave modes can either be fast magnetosonic waves originating from\ndownstream, outrunning the shock, or eigenmodes of the upstream plasma drifting\nthrough the shock. Using linear perturbation theory in relativistic MHD, this\npaper provides a general analysis of the corrugation of relativistic magnetized\nfast shock waves resulting from their interaction with small amplitude\ndisturbances. Transfer functions characterizing the linear response for each of\nthe outgoing modes are calculated as a function of the magnetization of the\nupstream medium and as a function of the nature of the incoming wave.\nInterestingly, if the latter is an eigenmode of the upstream plasma, we find\nthat there exists a resonance at which the (linear) response of the shock\nbecomes large or even diverges. This result may have profound consequences on\nthe phenomenology of astrophysical relativistic magnetized shock waves.\n", "  We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of the fullerene\nC60-containing planetary nebula (PN) Lin49 in the Small Magellanic Cloud using\nXSHOOTER at the ESO VLT and the Spitzer/IRS instruments. We derived nebular\nabundances for nine elements. We used TLUSTY to derive photospheric parameters\nfor the central star. Lin49 is C-rich and metal-deficient PN (Z~0.0006). The\nnebular abundances are in good agreement with Asymptotic Giant Branch\nnucleosynthesis models for stars with initial mass 1.25 Msun and metallicity Z\n= 0.001. Using the TLUSTY synthetic spectrum of the central star to define the\nheating and ionising source, we constructed the photoionisation model with\nCLOUDY that matches the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) and the\nline fluxes in the UV to far-IR wavelength ranges simultaneously. We could not\nfit the ~1-5 um SED using a model with 0.005-0.1 um-sized graphite grains and a\nconstant hydrogen density shell owing to the prominent near-IR excess, while at\nother wavelengths the model fits the observed values reasonably well. We argue\nthat the near-IR excess might indicate either (1) the presence of very small\nparticles in the form of small carbon clusters, small graphite sheets, or\nfullerene precursors, or (2) the presence of a high-density structure\nsurrounding the central star. We found that SMC C60 PNe show a near-IR excess\ncomponent to lesser or greater degree. This suggests that these C60 PNe might\nmaintain a structure nearby their central star.\n", "  A crucial topic in planetology research is establishing links between\nprimitive meteorites and their parent asteroids. In this study we investigate\nthe feasibility of a connection between asteroids similar to 21 Lutetia,\nencountered by the Rosetta mission in July 2010, and the CH3 carbonaceous\nchondrite Pecora Escarpment 91467 (PCA 91467). Several spectra of this\nmeteorite were acquired in the ultraviolet to near-infrared (0.3 to 2.2 {\\mu}m)\nand in the mid-infrared to thermal infrared (2.5 to 30.0 {\\mu}m or 4000 to ~333\ncm^-1), and they are compared here to spectra from the asteroid 21 Lutetia.\nThere are several similarities in absorption bands and overall spectral\nbehavior between this CH3 meteorite and 21 Lutetia. Considering also that the\nbulk density of Lutetia is similar to that of CH chondrites, we suggest that\nthis asteroid could be similar, or related to, the parent body of these\nmeteorites, if not the parent body itself. However, the apparent surface\ndiversity of Lutetia pointed out in previous studies indicates that it could\nsimultaneously be related to other types of chondrites. Future discovery of\nadditional unweathered CH chondrites could provide deeper insight in the\npossible connection between this family of metal-rich carbonaceous chondrites\nand 21 Lutetia or other featureless, possibly hydrated high-albedo asteroids.\n", "  Despite containing about a half of the total matter in the Universe, at most\nwavelengths the filamentary structure of the cosmic web is difficult to\nobserve. In this work, we use large unigrid cosmological simulations to\ninvestigate how the geometrical, thermodynamical and magnetic properties of\ncosmological filaments vary with mass and redshift (z $\\leq 1$). We find that\nthe average temperature, length, volume and magnetic field of filaments are\ntightly log-log correlated with the underlying total gravitational mass. This\nreflects the role of self-gravity in shaping their properties and enables\nstatistical predictions of their observational properties based on their mass.\nWe also focus on the properties of the simulated population of galaxy-sized\nhalos within filaments, and compare their properties to the results obtained\nfrom the spectroscopic GAMA survey. Simulated and observed filaments with the\nsame length are found to contain an equal number of galaxies, with very similar\ndistribution of halo masses. The total number of galaxies within each filament\nand the total/average stellar mass in galaxies can now be used to predict also\nthe large-scale properties of the gas in the host filaments across tens or\nhundreds of Mpc in scale. These results are the first steps towards the future\nuse of galaxy catalogues in order to select the best targets for observations\nof the warm-hot intergalactic medium.\n", "  We present our multiwavelength analysis of a prototype \\HI-excess galaxy,\nGASS 3505, selected based on having a large gas content ($M_{\\rm HI} =\n10^{9.9}$ \\msun) compared to its little associated star formation activity\n($\\sim$0.1 \\msun\\ yr$^{-1}$) in the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS). Very\nLarge Array (VLA) observations show that the \\HI\\ in GASS 3505 is distributed\nin a regularly rotating, extended ($\\sim$50 kpc radius) gas ring. In the SDSS\noptical image GASS 3505 appears as a bulge-dominated galaxy, however deep\noptical imaging reveals low surface brightness ($\\gtrsim25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$)\nstellar emission around the central bulge. Direct evidence for accretion is\ndetected in form of an extended ($\\sim$60 kpc) stellar stream, showing that\nGASS 3505 has experienced a minor merger in the recent past. We investigate the\npossibility that the \\HI\\ ring in GASS 3505 was accreted in such a merger event\nusing N-body and smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations. The best\nmodel that reproduces the general properties (i.e., gas distribution and\nkinematics, stellar morphology) of the galaxy involves a merger between the\ncentral bulge and a gas-rich ($M_{\\star}$ = 10$^9$ \\msun\\ and $M_{\\rm\nHI}$/$M_{\\star}$ = 10) disk galaxy. However, small discrepancies in the\nobserved and modeled properties could suggest that other sources of gas have to\nbe involved in the build-up of the gas reservoir. This work is the first step\ntoward a larger program to investigate the physical mechanisms that drive the\nlarge scatter in the gas scaling relations of nearby galaxies.\n", "  An innovative field-particle correlation technique is proposed that uses\nsingle-point measurements of the electromagnetic fields and particle velocity\ndistribution functions to investigate the net transfer of energy from fields to\nparticles associated with the collisionless damping of turbulent fluctuations\nin weakly collisional plasmas, such as the solar wind. In addition to providing\na direct estimate of the local rate of energy transfer between fields and\nparticles, it provides vital new information about the distribution of that\nenergy transfer in velocity space. This velocity-space signature can\npotentially be used to identify the dominant collisionless mechanism\nresponsible for the damping of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind. The\napplication of this novel field-particle correlation technique is illustrated\nusing the simplified case of the Landau damping of Langmuir waves in an\nelectrostatic 1D-1V Vlasov-Poisson plasma, showing that the procedure both\nestimates the local rate of energy transfer from the electrostatic field to the\nelectrons and indicates the resonant nature of this interaction. Modifications\nof the technique to enable single-point spacecraft measurements of fields and\nparticles to diagnose the collisionless damping of turbulent fluctuations in\nthe solar wind are discussed, yielding a method with the potential to transform\nour ability to maximize the scientific return from current and upcoming\nspacecraft missions, such as the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) and Solar\nProbe Plus missions.\n", "  In this work, we studied oscillation parameters in faculae above magnetic\nknots and in the adjacent to them areas. Using SDO data we analysed\noscillations in magnetic strength, Doppler velocity, and intensity signals for\nthe lower photosphere, and in intensity for the higher levels. We found that in\nthe magnetic field strength oscillation spectra in magnetic knots, peaks at a\nfrequency of about 4.8 mHz appear, while there are no such frequencies in the\nadjacent facular patches of a moderate field strength. On the contrary, Doppler\nvelocity photospheric oscillation spectra are similar for these types of\nregions: in both cases, the significant peaks are in the 2.5--4.5 mHz range,\nthough the oscillations in magnetic knots are 2--3 times weaker than those at\nthe facular periphery. At the upper photosphere, the dominant frequencies in\nmagnetic knots are 0.5--1 mHz higher than in the medium-field regions. The\ntransition region oscillations above magnetic knots mainly concentrate in the\n3--6 mHz range, and those above moderate-field patches concentrate below 3 mHz.\n", "  Up-to-date isochrones, zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB) loci, and\nevolutionary tracks for core He-burning stars are applied to the\ncolor-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of M3, M15, and M92, focusing in particular on\ntheir RR Lyrae populations. Periods for ab- and c-type variables are calculated\nusing the latest theoretical calibrations of log P_ab and log P_c as a function\nof luminosity, mass, effective temperature, and metallicity. Our models are\ngenerally able to reproduce the measured periods to well within the\nuncertainties implied by the stellar properties on which pulsation periods\ndepend, as well as the mean periods and cluster-to-cluster differences in\n<P_ab> and <P_c>, on the assumption of well-supported values of E(B-V),\n(m-M)_V, and [Fe/H]. While many of the RR Lyrae in M3 lie close to the same\nZAHB that fits the faintest HB stars at bluer or redder colors, the M92\nvariables are all significantly evolved stars from ZAHB locations on the blue\nside of the instability strip. M15 appears to contain a similar population of\nHB stars as M92, along with additional helium-enhanced populations not present\nin the latter which comprise most of its RR Lyrae stars. The large number of\nvariables in M15 and the similarity of the observed values of <P_ab> and <P_c>\nin M15 and M92 can be explained by HB models that allow for variations in Y.\nSimilar ages (~12.5 Gyr) are found for all three clusters, making them\nsignificantly younger than the field halo subgiant HD 140283. Our analysis\nsuggests a preference for stellar models that take diffusive processes into\naccount.\n", "  We investigate systematically whether accreting black hole systems are likely\nto reach global alignment of the black hole spin and its accretion disc with\nthe binary plane. In low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) there is only a modest\ntendency to reach such global alignment, and it is difficult to achieve fully:\nexcept for special initial conditions we expect misalignment of the spin and\norbital planes by ~1 radian for most of the LMXB lifetime. The same is expected\nin high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). A fairly close approach to global\nalignment is likely in most stellar-mass ultraluminous X-ray binary systems\n(ULXs) where the companion star fills its Roche lobe and transfers on a thermal\ntimescale to a black hole of lower mass. These systems are unlikely to show\norbital eclipses, as their emission cones are close to the hole's spin axis.\nThis offers a potential observational test, as models for ULXs invoking\nintermediate-mass black holes do predict eclipses for ensembles of > ~10\nsystems. Recent observational work shows that eclipses are either absent or\nextremely rare in ULXs, supporting the picture that most ULXs are stellar-mass\nbinaries with companion stars more massive than the accretor.\n", "  We use the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry & Accurate Rotation Curves) database to\nstudy the relation between the central surface density of stars Sstar and\ndynamical mass Sdyn in 135 disk galaxies (S0 to dIrr). We find that Sdyn\ncorrelates tightly with Sstar over 4 dex. This central density relation can be\ndescribed by a double power law. High surface brightness galaxies are\nconsistent with a 1:1 relation, suggesting that they are self-gravitating and\nbaryon dominated in the inner parts. Low surface brightness galaxies\nsystematically deviate from the 1:1 line, indicating that the dark matter\ncontribution progressively increases but remains tightly coupled to the stellar\none. The observed scatter is small (~0.2 dex) and largely driven by\nobservational uncertainties. The residuals show no correlations with other\ngalaxy properties like stellar mass, size, or gas fraction.\n", "  We provide evidence that UGC1382, long believed to be a passive elliptical\ngalaxy, is actually a giant low surface brightness (GLSB) galaxy which rivals\nthe archetypical GLSB Malin 1 in size. Like other GLSB galaxies, it has two\ncomponents: a high surface brightness disk galaxy surrounded by an extended low\nsurface brightness (LSB) disk. For UGC1382, the central component is a\nlenticular system with an effective radius of 6 kpc. Beyond this, the LSB disk\nhas an effective radius of ~38 kpc and an extrapolated central surface\nbrightness of ~26 mag/arcsec^2. Both components have a combined stellar mass of\n~8x10^10 M_sun, and are embedded in a massive (10^10 M_sun) low-density (<3\nM_sun/pc^2) HI disk with a radius of 110 kpc, making this one of the largest\nisolated disk galaxies known. The system resides in a massive dark matter halo\nof at least 2x10^12 M_sun. Although possibly part of a small group, its low\ndensity environment likely plays a role in the formation and retention of the\ngiant LSB and HI disks. We model the spectral energy distributions and find\nthat the LSB disk is likely older than the lenticular component. UGC1382 has\nUV-optical colors typical of galaxies transitioning through the green valley.\nWithin the LSB disk are spiral arms forming stars at extremely low\nefficiencies. The gas depletion time scale of ~10^11 yr suggests that UGC1382\nmay be a very long term resident of the green valley. We find that the\nformation and evolution of the LSB disk is best explained by the accretion of\ngas-rich LSB dwarf galaxies.\n", "  Emission lines from highly-excited states (n >= 5) of H- and He-like ions\nhave been detected in astrophysical sources and fusion plasmas. For such\nexcited states, R-matrix or distorted wave calculations for electron-impact\nexcitation are very limited, due to the large size of the atomic basis set\nneeded to describe them. Calculations for n >= 6 are also not generally\navailable. We study the behaviour of the electron-impact excitation collision\nstrengths and effective collision strengths for the most important transitions\nused to model electron collision dominated astrophysical plasmas, solar, for\nexample. We investigate the dependence on the relevant parameters: the\nprincipal quantum number n or the nuclear charge Z. We also estimate the\nimportance of coupling to highly-excited states and the continuum by comparing\nthe results of different sized calculations. We provide analytic formulae to\ncalculate the electron-impact excitation collision strengths and effective\ncollision strengths to highly-excited states (n >= 8) of H- and He-like ions.\nThese extrapolated effective collision strengths can be used to interpret\nastrophysical and fusion plasma via collisional-radiative modelling.\n", "  Direct imaging allows for the detection and characterization of exoplanets\nvia their thermal emission. We report the discovery via imaging of a young\nJovian planet in a triple star system and characterize its atmospheric\nproperties through near-infrared spectroscopy. The semi-major axis of the\nplanet is closer relative to that of its hierarchical triple star system than\nfor any known exoplanet within a stellar binary or triple, making HD 131399\ndynamically unlike any other known system. The location of HD 131399Ab on a\nwide orbit in a triple system demonstrates that massive planets may be found on\nlong and possibly unstable orbits in multi-star systems. HD 131399Ab is one of\nthe lowest mass (4+/-1 MJup) and coldest (850+/-50 K) exoplanets to have been\ndirectly imaged.\n", "  We show how to construct a large class of quantum error correcting codes,\nknown as CSS codes, from highly entangled cluster states. This becomes a\nprimitive in a protocol that foliates a series of such cluster states into a\nmuch larger cluster state, implementing foliated quantum error correction. We\nexemplify this construction with several familiar quantum error correction\ncodes, and propose a generic method for decoding foliated codes. We numerically\nevaluate the error-correction performance of a family of finite-rate CSS codes\nknown as turbo codes, finding that it performs well over moderate depth\nfoliations. Foliated codes have applications for quantum repeaters and\nfault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computation.\n", "  We present new photometry of the dwarf irregular galaxy DDO 68, one of the\nmost metal-poor and least massive dwarfs, located in the Lynx-Cancer Void. The\nimages were acquired with the Large Binocular Telescope in the g and r\npassbands, and show unequivocally that DDO 68 has previously unknown stellar\nstreams related to the accretion of at least two smaller companions: a flea\nwith smaller fleas biting it, to put it in Jonathan Swift's words. Our data\nprovide direct observational evidence of multiple merging occurring at very low\ngalactic mass scales. We present the results of an N-body simulation of the\ninteraction of three dwarf galaxies which reproduces well the main\nmorphological features of DDO 68.\n", "  Aims. We aim to study the 250 micron luminosity function (LF) down to much\nfainter luminosities than achieved by previous efforts.\n  Methods. We developed a modified stacking method to reconstruct the 250\nmicron LF using optically selected galaxies from the SDSS survey and Herschel\nmaps of the GAMA equatorial fields and Stripe 82. Our stacking method not only\nrecovers the mean 250 micron luminosities of galaxies that are too faint to be\nindividually detected, but also their underlying distribution functions.\n  Results. We find very good agreement with previous measurements in the\noverlapping luminosity range. More importantly, we are able to derive the LF\ndown to much fainter luminosities (around 25 times fainter) than achieved by\nprevious studies. We find strong positive luminosity evolution \\propto (1 +\nz)^4.89\\pm1.07 and moderate negative density evolution \\propto (1 +\nz)^-1.02\\pm0.54 over the redshift range z=[0.02, 0.5].\n", "  We present 12 mm Mopra observations of the dense (>10^3 cm^-3 ) molecular gas\ntowards the north-east (NE) of the W28 supernova remnant (SNR). This cloud is\nspatially well-matched to the TeV gamma-ray source HESS J1801-233 and is known\nto be a SNR-molecular cloud interaction region. Shock-disruption is evident\nfrom broad NH3 (1,1) spectral line-widths in regions towards the W28 SNR, while\nstrong detections of spatially-extended NH3(3,3), NH3(4,4) and NH3(6,6)\ninversion emission towards the cloud strengthen the case for the existence of\nhigh temperatures within the cloud. Velocity dispersion measurements and\nNH3(n,n)/(1,1) ratio maps, where n=2, 3, 4 and 6, indicate that the source of\ndisruption is from the side of the cloud nearest to the W28 SNR, suggesting\nthat it is the source of cloud-disruption. Towards part of the cloud, the ratio\nof ortho to para-NH3 is observed to exceed 2, suggesting gas-phase NH3\nenrichment due to NH3 liberation from dust grain mantles. The measured NH3\nabundance with respect to H2 is ~(1.2+/-0.5)*10^-9, which is not high, as might\nbe expected for a hot, dense molecular cloud enriched by sublimated\ngrain-surface molecules. The results are suggestive of NH3 sublimation and\ndestruction in this molecular cloud, which is likely to be interacting with the\nW28 SNR shock.\n", "  We present the detection of an absorpton feature at $E=8.77^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$\nkeV in the combined X-ray spectrum of the ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 1313\nX-1 observed with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, significant at the 3$\\sigma$ level. If\nassociated with blueshifted ionized iron, the implied outflow velocity is\n~0.2$c$ for Fe XXVI, or ~0.25$c$ for Fe XXV. These velocities are similar to\nthe ultrafast outflow seen in absorption recently discovered in this source at\nlower energies by XMM-Newton, and we therefore conclude that this is an iron\ncomponent to the same outflow. Photoionization modeling marginally prefers the\nFe XXV solution, but in either case the outflow properties appear to be\nextreme, potentially supporting a super-Eddington hypothesis for NGC 1313 X-1.\n", "  Dense cloud cores present chemical differentiation due to the different\ndistribution of C-bearing and N-bearing molecules, the latter being less\naffected by freeze-out onto dust grains. In this letter we show that two\nC-bearing molecules, CH$_3$OH and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$, present a strikingly\ndifferent (complementary) morphology while showing the same kinematics toward\nthe prestellar core L1544. After comparing their distribution with large scale\nH$_2$ column density N(H$_2$) map from the Herschel satellite, we find that\nthese two molecules trace different environmental conditions in the surrounding\nof L1544: the $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ distribution peaks close to the southern part of\nthe core, where the surrounding molecular cloud has a N(H$_2$) sharp edge,\nwhile CH$_3$OH mainly traces the northern part of the core, where N(H$_2$)\npresents a shallower tail. We conclude that this is evidence of chemical\ndifferentiation driven by different amount of illumination from the\ninterstellar radiation field: in the South, photochemistry maintains more C\natoms in the gas phase allowing carbon chain (such as $c$-C$_3$H$_2$)\nproduction; in the North, C is mainly locked in CO and methanol traces the zone\nwhere CO starts to freeze out significantly. During the process of cloud\ncontraction, different gas and ice compositions are thus expected to mix toward\nthe central regions of the core, where a potential Solar-type system will form.\nAn alternative view on carbon-chain chemistry in star-forming regions is also\nprovided.\n", "  We present new KAT-7 observations of the neutral hydrogen (HI) spectral line,\nand polarized radio continuum emission, in the grand design spiral M83. These\nobservations provide a sensitive probe of the outer disk structure and\nkinematics, revealing a vast and massive neutral gas distribution that appears\nto be tightly coupled to the interaction of the galaxy with the environment. We\npresent a new rotation curve extending out to a radius of 50 kpc. Based on our\nnew HI dataset and comparison with multiwavelength data from the literature we\nconsider the impact of mergers on the outer disk and discuss the evolution of\nM83. We also study the periphery of the HI distribution and reveal a sharp edge\nto the gaseous disk that is consistent with photoionization or ram pressure\nfrom the intergalactic medium (IGM). The radio continuum emission is not nearly\nas extended as the HI and is restricted to the main optical disk. Despite the\nrelatively low angular resolution we are able to draw broad conclusions about\nthe large-scale magnetic field topology. We show that the magnetic field of M83\nis similar in form to other nearby star forming galaxies, and suggest that the\ndisk-halo interface may host a large-scale regular magnetic field.\n", "  We revisited the spectroscopic characteristics of narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies (NLS1s) by analysing a homogeneous sample of 296 NLS1s at redshift\nbetween 0.028 and 0.345, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7)\npublic archive. We confirm that NLS1s are mostly characterized by Balmer lines\nwith Lorentzian profiles, lower black hole masses and higher Eddington ratios\nthan classic broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1s), but they also appear to be active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) contiguous with BLS1s and sharing with them common\nproperties. Strong Fe II emission does not seem to be a distinctive property of\nNLS1s, as low values of Fe II/H$\\beta$ are equally observed in these AGNs. Our\ndata indicate that Fe II and Ca II kinematics are consistent with the one of\nH$\\beta$. On the contrary, O I $\\lambda$8446 seems to be systematically\nnarrower and it is likely emitted by gas of the broad-line region more distant\nfrom the ionizing source and showing different physical properties. Finally,\nalmost all NLS1s of our sample show radial motions of the narrow-line region\nhighly-ionised gas. The mechanism responsible for this effect is not yet clear,\nbut there are hints that very fast outflows require high continuum luminosities\n(> $10^{44}$ erg/s) or high Eddington ratios (log(L$_{\\rm bol}$/L$_{\\rm Edd}$)\n> -0.1).\n", "  We present the first study of GALEX far ultra-violet (FUV) luminosity\nfunctions of individual star-forming regions within a sample of 258 nearby\ngalaxies spanning a large range in total stellar mass and star formation\nproperties. We identify ~65,000 star-forming regions (i.e., FUV sources),\nmeasure each galaxy's luminosity function, and characterize the relationships\nbetween the luminosity function slope (alpha) and several global galaxy\nproperties. A final sample of 82 galaxies with reliable luminosity functions\nare used to define these relationships and represent the largest sample of\ngalaxies with the largest range of galaxy properties used to study the\nconnection between luminosity function properties and galaxy environment. We\nfind that alpha correlates with global star formation properties, where\ngalaxies with higher star formation rates and star formation rate densities\n(Sigma_SFR) tend to have flatter luminosity function slopes. In addition, we\nfind that neither stochastic sampling of the luminosity function in galaxies\nwith low-number statistics nor the effects of blending due to distance can\nfully account for these trends. We hypothesize that the flatter slopes in high\nSigma_SFR galaxies is due to higher gas densities and higher star formation\nefficiencies which result in proportionally greater numbers of bright\nstar-forming regions. Finally, we create a composite luminosity function\ncomposed of star-forming regions from many galaxies and find a break in the\nluminosity function at brighter luminosities. However, we find that this break\nis an artifact of varying detection limits for galaxies at different distances.\n", "  Spiral galaxies are thought to acquire their gas through a protracted infall\nphase resulting in the inside-out growth of their associated discs. For field\nspirals, this infall occurs in the lower density environments of the cosmic\nweb. The overall infall rate, as well as the galactocentric radius at which\nthis infall is incorporated into the star-forming disc, plays a pivotal role in\nshaping the characteristics observed today. Indeed, characterising the\nfunctional form of this spatio-temporal infall in-situ is exceedingly\ndifficult, and one is forced to constrain these forms using the present day\nstate of galaxies with model or simulation predictions. We present the infall\nrates used as input to a grid of chemical evolution models spanning the mass\nspectrum of discs observed today. We provide a systematic comparison with\nalternate analytical infall schemes in the literature, including a first\ncomparison with cosmological simulations. Identifying the degeneracies\nassociated with the adopted infall rate prescriptions in galaxy models is an\nimportant step in the development of a consistent picture of disc galaxy\nformation and evolution.\n", "  We have detected excess absorption in the emission cores of Ca II H & K\nduring transits of HD 189733b for the first time. Using observations of three\ntransits we investigate the origin of the absorption, which is also seen in\nH{\\alpha} and the Na I D lines. Applying differential spectrophotometry methods\nto the Ca II H and Ca II K lines combined, using respective passband widths of\n$\\Delta\\lambda$ = 0.4 & 0.6 \\AA\\ yields excess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0074\n$\\pm$ 0.0044 (1.7$\\sigma$; Transit 1) and 0.0214 +/- 0.0022 (9.8$\\sigma$;\nTransit 2). Similarly, we detect excess H{\\alpha} absorption in a passband of\nwidth $\\Delta\\lambda$ = 0.7 \\AA, with t$_d$ = 0.0084 $\\pm$ 0.0016 (5.2$\\sigma$)\nand 0.0121 $\\pm$ 0.0012 (9.9$\\sigma$). For both lines, Transit 2 is thus\nsignificantly deeper. Combining all three transits for the Na I D lines yields\nexcess absorption of t$_d$ = 0.0041 $\\pm$ 0.0006 (6.5$\\sigma$). By considering\nthe time series observations of each line, we find that the excess apparent\nabsorption is best recovered in the stellar reference frame. These findings\nlead us to postulate that the main contribution to the excess transit\nabsorption in the differential light curves arises because the normalising\ncontinuum bands form in the photosphere, whereas the line cores contain a\nchromospheric component. We can not rule out that part of the excess absorption\nsignature arises from the planetary atmosphere, but we present evidence which\ncasts doubt on recent claims to have detected wind motions in the planet's\natmosphere in these data.\n", "  We present an analysis of the first Kepler K2 mission observations of a\nrapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star, HD 24355 ($V=9.65$). The star was\ndiscovered in SuperWASP broadband photometry with a frequency of 224.31\nd$^{-1}$, (2596.18 $\\mu$Hz; $P = 6.4$ min) and an amplitude of 1.51 mmag, with\nlater spectroscopic analysis of low-resolution spectra showing HD 24355 to be\nan A5 Vp SrEu star. The high precision K2 data allow us to identify 13\nrotationally split sidelobes to the main pulsation frequency of HD 24355. This\nnumber of sidelobes combined with an unusual rotational phase variation show\nthis star to be the most distorted quadrupole roAp pulsator yet observed. In\nmodelling this star, we are able to reproduce well the amplitude modulation of\nthe pulsation, and find a close match to the unusual phase variations. We show\nthis star to have a pulsation frequency higher than the critical cut-off\nfrequency. This is currently the only roAp star observed with the Kepler\nspacecraft in Short Cadence mode that has a photometric amplitude detectable\nfrom the ground, thus allowing comparison between the mmag amplitude\nground-based targets and the $\\mu$mag spaced-based discoveries. No further\npulsation modes are identified in the K2 data, showing this star to be a\nsingle-mode pulsator.\n", "  We investigate a correlation between star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar\nmass for Halpha emission line galaxies (HAEs) in one of the richest\nproto-clusters ever known at z~2.5, USS 1558-003 proto-cluster. This study is\nbased on a 9.7-hour narrow-band imaging data with MOIRCS on the Subaru\ntelescope. We are able to construct a sample, in combination with additional\nH-band data taken with WFC3 on Hubble Space Telescope (HST), of 100 HAEs\nreaching the dust-corrected SFRs down to 3 Msun/yr and the stellar masses down\nto $10^{8.0}$ Msun. We find that while the star-forming galaxies with\n>$10^{9.3}$ Msun are located on the universal SFR-mass main sequence\nirrespective of the environment, less massive star-forming galaxies with\n<$10^{9.3}$ Msun show a significant upward scatter from the main sequence in\nthis proto-cluster. This suggests that some less massive galaxies are in a\nstarburst phase, although we do not know yet if this is due to environmental\neffects.\n", "  We present the results of 325 MHz GMRT observations of a super-cluster field,\nknown to contain five Abell clusters at redshift $z \\sim 0.2$. We achieve a\nnominal sensitivity of $34\\,\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ toward the phase centre. We\ncompile a catalogue of 3257 sources with flux densities in the range\n$183\\,\\mu\\rm{Jy}\\,-\\,1.5\\,\\rm{Jy}$ within the entire $\\sim 6.5$ square degree\nfield of view. Subsequently, we use available survey data at other frequencies\nto derive the spectral index distribution for a sub-sample of these sources,\nrecovering two distinct populations -- a dominant population which exhibit\nspectral index trends typical of steep-spectrum synchrotron emission, and a\nsmaller population of sources with typically flat or rising spectra. We\nidentify a number of sources with ultra-steep spectra or rising spectra for\nfurther analysis, finding two candidate high-redshift radio galaxies and three\ngigahertz-peaked-spectrum radio sources. Finally, we derive the\nEuclidean-normalised differential source counts using the catalogue compiled in\nthis work, for sources with flux densities in excess of $223 \\, \\mu$Jy. Our\ndifferential source counts are consistent with both previous observations at\nthis frequency and models of the low-frequency source population. These\nrepresent the deepest source counts yet derived at 325 MHz. Our source counts\nexhibit the well-known flattening at mJy flux densities, consistent with an\nemerging population of star-forming galaxies; we also find marginal evidence of\na downturn at flux densities below $308 \\, \\mu$Jy, a feature so far only seen\nat 1.4 GHz.\n", "  Timing results for the black-widow pulsar J2051-0827 are presented, using a\n21-year dataset from four European Pulsar Timing Array telescopes and the\nParkes radio telescope. This dataset, which is the longest published to date\nfor a black-widow system, allows for an improved analysis that addresses\npreviously unknown biases. While secular variations, as identified in previous\nanalyses, are recovered, short-term variations are detected for the first time.\nConcurrently, a significant decrease of approx. 2.5x10-3 cm-3 pc in the\ndispersion measure associated with PSR J2051-0827 is measured for the first\ntime and improvements are also made to estimates of the proper motion. Finally,\nPSR J2051-0827 is shown to have entered a relatively stable state suggesting\nthe possibility of its eventual inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.\n", "  We study how outflows of gas launched from a central galaxy undergoing\nrepeated starbursts propagate through the circumgalactic medium (CGM), using\nthe simulation code RAMSES. We assume that the outflow from the disk can be\nmodelled as a rapidly moving bubble of hot gas at $\\mathrm{\\sim1\\;kpc}$ above\ndisk, then ask what happens as it moves out further into the halo around the\ngalaxy on $\\mathrm{\\sim 100\\;kpc}$ scales. To do this we run 60 two-dimensional\nsimulations scanning over parameters of the outflow. Each of these is repeated\nwith and without radiative cooling, assuming a primordial gas composition to\ngive a lower bound on the importance of cooling. In a large fraction of\nradiative-cooling cases we are able to form rapidly outflowing cool gas from in\nsitu cooling of the flow. We show that the amount of cool gas formed depends\nstrongly on the 'burstiness' of energy injection; sharper, stronger bursts\ntypically lead to a larger fraction of cool gas forming in the outflow. The\nabundance ratio of ions in the CGM may therefore change in response to the\ndetailed historical pattern of star formation. For instance, outflows generated\nby star formation with short, intense bursts contain up to 60 per cent of their\ngas mass at temperatures $<5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{K}$; for near-continuous star\nformation the figure is $\\lesssim$ 5 per cent. Further study of cosmological\nsimulations, and of idealised simulations with e.g., metal-cooling, magnetic\nfields and/or thermal conduction, will help to understand the precise signature\nof bursty outflows on observed ion abundances.\n", "  We present a dynamical friction model based on Chandrasekhar's formula that\nreproduces the fast inspiral and stalling experienced by satellites orbiting\ngalaxies with a large constant density core. We show that the fast inspiral\nphase does not owe to resonance. Rather, it owes to the background velocity\ndistribution function for the constant density cores being dissimilar from the\nusually-assumed Maxwellian distribution. Using the correct background velocity\ndistribution function and the semi-analytic model from Petts et al. (2015), we\nare able to correctly reproduce the infall rate in both cored and cusped\npotentials. However, in the case of large cores, our model is no longer able to\ncorrectly capture core-stalling. We show that this stalling owes to the tidal\nradius of the satellite approaching the size of the core. By switching off\ndynamical friction when rt(r) = r (where rt is the tidal radius at the\nsatellite's position) we arrive at a model which reproduces the N-body results\nremarkably well. Since the tidal radius can be very large for constant density\nbackground distributions, our model recovers the result that stalling can occur\nfor Ms/Menc << 1, where Ms and Menc are the mass of the satellite and the\nenclosed galaxy mass, respectively. Finally, we include the contribution to\ndynamical friction that comes from stars moving faster than the satellite. This\nnext-to-leading order effect becomes the dominant driver of inspiral near the\ncore region, prior to stalling.\n", "  Pop III stars are typically massive stars of primordial composition forming\nat the centers of the first collapsed dark matter structures. Here we estimate\nthe optimal X-ray emission in the early universe for promoting the formation of\nPop III stars. This is important in determining the number of dwarf galaxies\nformed before reionization and their fossils in the local universe, as well as\nthe number of intermediate-mass seed black holes. A mean X-ray emission per\nsource above the optimal level reduces the number of Pop III stars because of\nthe increased Jeans mass of the intergalactic medium (IGM), while a lower\nemission suppresses the formation rate of H2 preventing or delaying star\nformation in dark matter minihalos above the Jeans mass. The build up of the H2\ndissociating background is slower than the X-ray background due to the\nshielding effect of resonant hydrogen Lyman lines. Hence, the nearly\nunavoidable X-ray emission from supernova remnants of Pop III stars is\nsufficient to boost their number to few tens per comoving Mpc^3 by redshift\nz~15. We find that there is a critical X-ray to UV energy ratio emitted per\nsource that produces a universe where the number of Pop III stars is largest:\n400 per comoving- Mpc^3. This critical ratio is very close to the one provided\nby 20-40 M_sun Pop III stars exploding as hypernovae. High mass X-ray binaries\nin dwarf galaxies are far less effective at increasing the number of Pop III\nstars than normal supernova remnants, we thus conclude that supernovae drove\nthe formation of Pop III stars.\n", "  The EAGLE cosmological simulations reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass\nfunction and many galaxy properties. In this work, we study the dust-related\nproperties of present-day EAGLE galaxies through mock observations in the\nfar-infrared and submm wavelength ranges obtained with the 3D dust radiative\ntransfer code SKIRT. To prepare an EAGLE galaxy for radiative transfer\nprocessing, we derive a diffuse dust distribution from the gas particles and we\nre-sample the star-forming gas particles and the youngest star particles into\nstar-forming regions that are assigned dedicated emission templates. We select\na set of redshift-zero EAGLE galaxies that matches the K-band luminosity\ndistribution of the galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS), a\nvolume-limited sample of about 300 normal galaxies in the Local Universe. We\nfind overall agreement of the EAGLE dust scaling relations with those observed\nin the HRS, such as the dust-to-stellar mass ratio versus stellar mass and\nversus NUV-r colour relations. A discrepancy in the f_250/f_350 versus\nf_350/f_500 submm colour-colour relation implies that part of the simulated\ndust is insufficiently heated, likely because of limitations in our sub-grid\nmodel for star-forming regions. We also investigate the effect of adjusting the\nmetal-to-dust ratio and the covering factor of the photodissociation regions\nsurrounding the star-forming cores. We are able to constrain the important\ndust-related parameters in our method, informing the calculation of dust\nattenuation for EAGLE galaxies in the UV and optical domain.\n", "  Gomes-J\\'unior et al. (2015) published 3613 positions for the 8 largest\nirregular satellites of Jupiter and 1787 positions for the largest irregular\nsatellite of Saturn, Phoebe. These observations were made between 1995 and 2014\nand have an estimated error of about 60 to 80 mas. Based on this set of\npositions, we derived new orbits for the eight largest irregular satellites of\nJupiter: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Carme, Lysithea, Sinope, Ananke and Leda.\nFor Phoebe we updated the ephemeris from Desmars et al. (2013) using 75% more\npositions than the previous one. Due to their orbital characteristics, it is\ncommon belief that the irregular satellites were captured by the giant planets\nin the early Solar System, but there is no consensus for a single model\nexplaining where they were formed. Size, shape, albedo and composition would\nhelp to trace back their true origin, but these physical parameters are yet\npoorly known for irregular satellites. The observation of stellar occultations\nwould allow for the determination of such parameters. Indeed Jupiter will cross\nthe galactic plane in 2019-2020 and Saturn in 2018, improving a lot the chances\nof observing such events in the near future. Using the derived ephemerides and\nthe UCAC4 catalogue we managed to identify 5442 candidate stellar occultations\nbetween January 2016 and December 2020 for the 9 satellites studied here. We\ndiscussed how the successful observation of a stellar occultation by these\nobjects is possible and present some potential occultations.\n", "  We present a statistical method for measuring the average HI spin temperature\nin distant galaxies using the expected detection yields from future wide-field\n21cm absorption surveys. As a demonstrative case study we consider a simulated\nall-southern-sky survey of 2-h per pointing with the Australian Square\nKilometre Array Pathfinder for intervening HI absorbers at intermediate\ncosmological redshifts between $z = 0.4$ and $1$. For example, if such a survey\nyielded $1000$ absorbers we would infer a harmonic-mean spin temperature of\n$\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin} \\sim 100$K for the population of damped Lyman\n$\\alpha$ (DLAs) absorbers at these redshifts, indicating that more than $50$\nper cent of the neutral gas in these systems is in a cold neutral medium (CNM).\nConversely, a lower yield of only 100 detections would imply\n$\\overline{T}_\\mathrm{spin} \\sim 1000$K and a CNM fraction less than $10$ per\ncent. We propose that this method can be used to provide independent\nverification of the spin temperature evolution reported in recent 21cm surveys\nof known DLAs at high redshift and for measuring the spin temperature at\nintermediate redshifts below $z \\approx 1.7$, where the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line is\ninaccessible using ground-based observatories. Increasingly more sensitive and\nlarger surveys with the Square Kilometre Array should provide stronger\nstatistical constraints on the average spin temperature. However, these will\nultimately be limited by the accuracy to which we can determine the HI column\ndensity frequency distribution, the covering factor and the redshift\ndistribution of the background radio source population.\n", "  We present the analysis of 35.5 square degrees of images in the 1-0S(1) line\nof H2 from the UK Widefield Infrared Survey for H2 (UWISH2) towards Cassiopeia\nand Auriga. We have identified 98 Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects\n(MHOs) driven by Young Stellar Objects, 60% of which are bipolar outflows and\nall are new discoveries. We estimate that the UWISH2 extended emission object\ncatalogue contains fewer than % false positives and is complete at the 95%\nlevel for jets and outflows brighter than the UWISH2 detection limit. We\nidentified reliable driving source candidates for three quarters of the\ndetected outflows, 40% of which are associated with groups and clusters of\nstars. The driving source candidates are 20% protostars, the remainder are\nCTTSs. We also identified 15 new star cluster candidates near MHOs in the\nsurvey area.\n  We find that the typical outflow identified in the sample has the following\ncharacteristics: the position angles are randomly orientated; bipolar outflows\nare straight within a few degrees; the two lobes are slightly asymmetrical in\nlength and brightness; the length and brightness of the lobes are not\ncorrelated; typical time gaps between major ejections of material are 1-3kyr,\nhence FU-Ori or EX-Ori eruptions are most likely not the cause of these, but we\nsuggest MNors as a possible source. Furthermore, we find that outflow lobe\nlength distributions are statistically different from the widely used total\nlength distributions. There are a larger than expected number of bright\noutflows indicating that the flux distribution does not follow a power law.\n", "  Treatment of the vortex motion in the superfluids of the inner crust and the\nouter core of neutron stars is a key ingredient in modeling a number of pulsar\nphenomena, including glitches and magnetic field evolution. After recalculating\nthe microscopic vortex velocity in the inner crust, we evaluate the velocity\nfor the vortices in the outer core for the first time. The vortex motion\nbetween pinning sites is found to be substantially faster in the inner crust\nthan in the outer core, $v_0^{\\rm crust} \\sim 10^{7}\\mbox{\\cms} \\gg v_0^{\\rm\ncore} \\sim 1\\mbox{\\cms}$. One immediate result is that vortex creep is always\nin the nonlinear regime in the outer core in contrast to the inner crust, where\nboth nonlinear and linear regimes of vortex creep are possible. Other\nimplications for pulsar glitches and magnetic field evolution are also\npresented.\n", "  We present deep near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of the globular\ncluster 2MASS-GC03 projected in the Galactic disk using MMIRS on the Clay\ntelescope (Las Campanas Observatory) and VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea\nsurvey (VVV) data. Most probable cluster member candidates were identified from\nnear-infrared photometry. Out of ten candidates that were followed-up\nspectroscopically, five have properties of cluster members, from which we\ncalculate <[Fe/H]> = -0.9 +- 0.2 and a radial velocity of v_r > = -78 +-\n12km/s. A distance of 10.8kpc is estimated from 3 likely RRLyrae members. Given\nthat the cluster is currently at a distance of 4.2kpc from the Galactic center,\nthe cluster's long survival time of an estimated 11.3 +- 1.2Gyr strengthens the\ncase for its globular-cluster nature. The cluster has a hint of elongation in\nthe direction of the Galactic center.\n", "  We present magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a strong accretion onto\nmagnetized proto-neutron stars for the Kesteven 79 (Kes 79) scenario. The\nsupernova remnant Kes 79, observed with the Chandra ACIS-I instrument during\napproximately 8.3 h, is located in the constellation Aquila at a distance of\n7.1 kpc in the galactic plane. It is a galactic and a very young object with an\nestimate age of 6 kyr. The Chandra image has revealed, for the first time, a\npoint-like source at the center of the remnant. The Kes 79 compact remnant\nbelongs to a special class of objects, the so-called Central Compact Objects,\nwhich exhibits no evidence for a surrounding pulsar wind nebula. In this work\nwe show that the submergence of the magnetic field during the hypercritical\nphase can explain such behavior for Kes 79 and others CCOs. The simulations of\nsuch regime were carried out with the adaptive-mesh-refinement code FLASH in\ntwo spatial dimensions, including radiative loss by neutrinos and an adequate\nequation of state for such regime. From the simulations, we estimate that the\nnumber of thermal neutrinos expected on the Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment is\n733$\\pm$364. In addition, we compute the flavor ratio on Earth for a progenitor\nmodel.\n", "  SN 2005kd is among the most luminous supernovae (SNe) to be discovered at\nX-ray wavelengths. We have re-analysed all good angular resolution (better than\n$20\"$ FWHM PSF) archival X-ray data for SN 2005kd. The data reveal an X-ray\nlight curve that decreases as t$^{-1.62 \\pm 0.06}$. Our modelling of the data\nsuggests that the early evolution is dominated by emission from the forward\nshock in a high-density medium. Emission from the radiative reverse shock is\nabsorbed by the cold dense shell formed behind the reverse shock. Our results\nsuggest a progenitor with a mass-loss rate towards the end of its evolution of\n$\\ge$ 4.3 $\\times$ 10$^{-4} M_{\\odot} \\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, for a wind velocity of\n10 km s$^{-1}$, at 4.0 $\\times$ 10$^{16}$ cm. This mass-loss rate is too high\nfor most known stars, except perhaps hypergiant stars. A higher wind velocity\nwould lead to a correspondingly higher mass-loss rate. A Luminous Blue Variable\nstar undergoing a giant eruption could potentially fulfill this requirement,\nbut would need a high mass-loss rate lasting for several hundred years, and\nneed to explain the plateau observed in the optical light curve. The latter\ncould perhaps be due to the ejecta expanding in the dense circumstellar\nmaterial at relatively small radii. These observations are consistent with the\nfact that Type IIn SNe appear to expand into high density and high mass-loss\nrate environments, and also suggest rapid variability in the wind mass-loss\nparameters within at least the last 5000 years of stellar evolution prior to\ncore-collapse.\n", "  To study the influence of microwave irradiation on two-dimensional electrons,\nwe apply a method based on capacitance measurements in GaAs quantum well\nsamples where the gate covers a central part of the layer. We find that the\ncapacitance oscillations at high magnetic fields, caused by the oscillations of\nthermodynamic density of states, are not essentially modified by microwaves.\nHowever, in the region of fields below 1 Tesla, we observe another set of\noscillation, with the period and the phase identical to those of microwave\ninduced resistance oscillations. The phenomenon of microwave induced\ncapacitance oscillations is explained in terms of violation of the Einstein\nrelation between conductivity and the diffusion coefficient in the presence of\nmicrowaves, which leads to a dependence of the capacitor charging on the\nanomalous conductivity. We also observe microwave-induced oscillations in the\ncapacitive response to periodic variations of external heating. These\noscillations appear due to the thermoelectric effect and are in antiphase with\nmicrowave induced resistance oscillations because of the Corbino-like geometry\nof our experimental setup.\n", "  Microlensing provides a unique tool to break the stellar to dark matter\ndegeneracy in the inner Milky Way. We combine N-body dynamical models fitted to\nthe Milky Way's Boxy/Peanut bulge with exponential disk models outside this,\nand compute the microlensing properties. Considering the range of models\nconsistent with the revised MOA-II data, we find low dark matter fractions in\nthe inner Galaxy: at the peak of their stellar rotation curve a fraction\n$f_v=(0.88\\pm0.07)$ of the circular velocity is baryonic (at $1\\sigma$, $f_v >\n0.72$ at $2\\sigma$). These results are in agreement with constraints from the\nEROS-II microlensing survey of brighter resolved stars, where we find\n$f_v=(0.9\\pm0.1)$ at $1\\sigma$. Our fiducial model of a disk with scale length\n2.6kpc, and a bulge with a low dark matter fraction of 12%, agrees with both\nthe revised MOA-II and EROS-II microlensing data. The required baryonic\nfractions, and the resultant low contribution from dark matter, are consistent\nwith the NFW profiles produced by dissipationless cosmological simulations in\nMilky Way mass galaxies. They are also consistent with recent prescriptions for\nthe mild adiabatic contraction of Milky Way mass haloes without the need for\nstrong feedback, but there is some tension with recent measurements of the\nlocal dark matter density. Microlensing optical depths from the larger OGLE-III\nsample could improve these constraints further when available.\n", "  We present LZIFU (LaZy-IFU), an IDL toolkit for fitting multiple emission\nlines simultaneously in integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data. LZIFU is useful\nfor the investigation of the dynamical, physical and chemical properties of gas\nin galaxies. LZIFU has already been applied to many world-class IFS instruments\nand large IFS surveys, including the Wide Field Spectrograph, the new Multi\nUnit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area\n(CALIFA) survey, the Sydney-Australian-astronomical-observatory Multi-object\nIntegral-field spectrograph (SAMI) Galaxy Survey. Here we describe in detail\nthe structure of the toolkit, and how the line fluxes and flux uncertainties\nare determined, including the possibility of having multiple distinct kinematic\ncomponents. We quantify the performance of LZIFU, demonstrating its accuracy\nand robustness. We also show examples of applying LZIFU to CALIFA and SAMI data\nto construct emission line and kinematic maps, and investigate complex, skewed\nline profiles presented in IFS data. The code is made available to the\nastronomy community through github. LZIFU will be further developed over time\nto other IFS instruments, and to provide even more accurate line and\nuncertainty estimates.\n", "  We investigate the scalar and pseudoscalar spectrum of the $SU(2)$ gauge\ntheory with $N_f=2$ flavours of fermions in the fundamental representation\nusing non perturbative lattice simulations. We provide first benchmark\nestimates of the mass of the lightest $0(0^{+})$ ($\\sigma$), $0(0^{-})$\n($\\eta'$) and $1(0^+)$ ($a_0$) states, including estimates of the relevant\ndisconnected contributions. We find $m_{a_0}/F_{\\rm{PS}}= 16.7(4.9)$,\n$m_\\sigma/F_{\\rm{PS}}=19.2(10.8)$ and $m_{\\eta'}/F_{\\rm{PS}} = 12.8(4.7)$.\nThese values for the masses of light scalar states provide crucial information\nfor composite extensions of the Standard Model from the unified Fundamental\nComposi te Higgs-Technicolor theory \\cite{Cacciapaglia:2014uja} to models of\ncomposite dark matter.\n", "  We report nine years of optical spectroscopy of the metal-polluted white\ndwarf SDSS J104341.53+085558.2, which presents morphological variations of the\nline profiles of the 8600 \\AA\\ Ca II triplet emission from the gaseous\ncomponent of its debris disc. Similar changes in the shape of the Ca II triplet\nhave also been observed in two other systems that host a gaseous disc, and are\nlikely related to the same mechanism. We report the Mg, Si, and Ca abundances\nof the debris detected in the photosphere of SDSS J1043+0855, place upper\nlimits on O and Fe, and derive an accretion rate of (2.5 - 12)x$10^8$ g/s,\nconsistent with those found in other systems with detected debris discs. The\nMg/Si ratio and the upper limit on the Fe/Si ratio of the accreted material\nbroadly agree with those found for the crust of the Earth. We also review the\nrange of variability observed among white dwarfs with planetary debris discs.\n", "  We report the optical spectroscopy of four young radio sources which are\nobserved with the Lijiang 2.4m telescope. The Eddington ratios of these sources\nare similar with those of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). Their Fe {\\sc\nii} emission is strong while [O {\\sc iii}] strength is weak. These results\nconfirm the NLS1 features of young radio sources, except that the width of\nbroad H$\\beta$ of young radio sources is larger than that of NLS1s. We thus\nsuggest that the young radio sources are the high black hole mass counterparts\nof steep-spectrum radio-loud NLS1s. In addition, the broad H$\\beta$ component\nof \\astrobj{4C 12.50} is the blue wing of the narrow component, but not from\nthe broad line region.\n", "  We consider an inhomogeneous small-world network (SWN) composed of inhibitory\nshort-range (SR) and long-range (LR) interneurons. By varying the fraction of\nLR interneurons $p_{long}$, we investigate the effect of network architecture\non emergence of sparsely synchronized rhythms, and make comparison with that in\nthe Watts-Strogatz SWN. Although SR and LR interneurons have the same average\nin- and out-degrees, their betweenness centralities (characterizing the\npotentiality in controlling communication between other interneurons) are\ndistinctly different. Hence, in view of the betweenness, SWNs we consider are\ninhomogeneous, unlike the \"canonical\" Watts-Strogatz SWN with nearly same\nbetweenness centralities. As $p_{long}$ is increased, the average path length\nbecomes shorter, and the load of communication traffic is less concentrated on\nLR interneurons, which leads to better efficiency of global communication\nbetween interneurons. Eventually, when passing a critical value\n$p_{long}^{(c)}$ $(\\simeq 0.16)$, sparsely synchronized rhythms are found to\nemerge. We also consider two cases of external time-periodic stimuli applied to\nsub-groups of LR and SR interneurons, respectively. Dynamical responses (such\nas synchronization suppression and enhancement) to these two cases of stimuli\nare studied and discussed in relation to the betweenness centralities of\nstimulated interneurons, representing the effectiveness for transfer of\nstimulation effect in the whole network.\n", "  We report the detection of a $78.1\\pm0.5$ day period in the X-ray lightcurve\nof the extreme ultraluminous X-ray source NGC 5907 ULX1\n($L_{\\rm{X,peak}}\\sim5\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$), discovered during an\nextensive monitoring program with Swift. These periodic variations are strong,\nwith the observed flux changing by a factor of $\\sim$3-4 between the peaks and\nthe troughs of the cycle; our simulations suggest that the observed periodicity\nis detected comfortably in excess of 3$\\sigma$ significance. We discuss\npossible origins for this X-ray period, but conclude that at the current time\nwe cannot robustly distinguish between orbital and super-orbital variations.\n", "  We constructed a comprehensive model atom for C\\ione\\ -- C\\ii\\ using the most\nup-to-date atomic data available and evaluated the non-local thermodynamic\nequilibrium (NLTE) line formation for C\\ione\\ and C\\ii\\ in classical 1D models\nrepresenting the atmospheres of A and late B-type stars. Our NLTE calculations\npredict the emission that appears at effective temperature of 9250 to 10\\,500~K\ndepending on log~$g$ in the C\\ione\\ 8335, 9405\\,\\AA\\ singlet lines and at\n\\Teff~$>$~15\\,000~K (log~$g$ = 4) in the C\\ione\\ 9061 -- 9111\\,\\AA\\,, 9603 --\n9658\\,\\AA\\, triplet lines. A prerequisite of the emission phenomenon is the\noverionization-recombination mechanism resulting in a depopulation of the lower\nlevels of C\\ione\\ to a greater extent than the upper levels. Extra depopulation\nof the lower levels of the transitions corresponding to the near-infrared\nlines, is caused by photon loss in the UV lines C\\ione\\ 2479, 1930, and\n1657\\,\\AA. We analysed the lines of C\\ione\\ and C\\ii\\ in Vega, HD~73666,\nSirius, 21~Peg, $\\pi$~Cet, HD~22136, and $\\iota$ Her taking advantage of their\nobserved high-resolution spectra. The C\\ione\\ emission lines were detected in\nthe four hottest stars, and they were well reproduced in our NLTE calculations.\nFor each star, the mean NLTE abundances from lines of the two ionization\nstages, C\\ione\\ and C\\ii, including the C\\ione\\ emission lines, were found to\nbe consistent. We show that the predicted C\\ione\\ emission phenomenon depends\nstrongly on whether accurate or approximate electron-impact excitation rates\nare applied.\n", "  Pulsars are the only cosmic radio sources known to be sufficiently compact to\nshow diffractive interstellar scintillations. Images of the variance of radio\nsignals in both time and frequency can be used to detect pulsars in large-scale\ncontinuum surveys using the next generation of synthesis radio telescopes. This\ntechnique allows a search over the full field of view while avoiding the need\nfor expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. We investigate the\nsensitivity of detecting pulsars in variance images. We show that variance\nimages are most sensitive to pulsars whose scintillation time-scales and\nbandwidths are close to the subintegration time and channel bandwidth.\nTherefore, in order to maximise the detection of pulsars for a given radio\ncontinuum survey, it is essential to retain a high time and frequency\nresolution, allowing us to make variance images sensitive to pulsars with\ndifferent scintillation properties. We demonstrate the technique with\nMurchision Widefield Array data and show that variance images can indeed lead\nto the detection of pulsars by distinguishing them from other radio sources.\n", "  This paper features and elaborates recent developments and modifications in\nasymptotic techniques in solving differential equation in non linear dynamics.\nThese methods are proved to be powerful to solve weakly as well as strongly non\nlinear cases. Obtained approximate analytical solutions are valid for the whole\nsolution domain. In this paper, limitations of traditional perturbation methods\nare illustrated with various modified techniques. Mathematical tools such as\nvariational approach, homotopy and iteration technique are discussed to solve\nvarious problems efficiently. Asymptotic methods such as Variational Method,\nmodified Lindstedt-Poincare method, Linearized perturbation method, Parameter\nExpansion method, Homotopy Perturbation method and Perturbation-Iteration\nmethods(singular and non singular cases) have been discussed in various\nsituations. Main emphasis is given on Singular perturbation method and WKB\nmethod in various numerical problems.\n", "  In solar-type stars (with radiative cores and convective envelopes), the\nmagnetic field powers star spots, flares and other solar phenomena, as well as\nchromospheric and coronal emission at ultraviolet to X-ray wavelengths. The\ndynamo responsible for generating the field depends on the shearing of internal\nmagnetic fields by differential rotation. The shearing has long been thought to\ntake place in a boundary layer known as the tachocline between the radiative\ncore and the convective envelope. Fully convective stars do not have a\ntachocline and their dynamo mechanism is expected to be very different,\nalthough its exact form and physical dependencies are not known. Here we report\nobservations of four fully convective stars whose X-ray emission correlates\nwith their rotation periods in the same way as in Sun-like stars. As the X-ray\nactivity - rotation relationship is a well-established proxy for the behaviour\nof the magnetic dynamo, these results imply that fully convective stars also\noperate a solar-type dynamo. The lack of a tachocline in fully convective stars\ntherefore suggests that this is not a critical ingredient in the solar dynamo\nand supports models in which the dynamo originates throughout the convection\nzone.\n", "  We present our study of the central point source CXOU J181852.0-150213 in the\nyoung Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) G15.9+0.2 based on the recent ~90 ks\nChandra observations. The point source was discovered in 2005 in shorter\nChandra observations and was hypothesized to be a neutron star associated with\nthe SNR. Our X-ray spectral analysis strongly supports the hypothesis of a\nthermally emitting neutron star associated with G15.9+0.2. We conclude that the\nobject belongs to the class of young cooling low-magnetized neutron stars\nreferred to as central compact objects (CCOs). We modeled the spectrum of the\nneutron star with a blackbody spectral function and with our hydrogen and\ncarbon neutron star atmosphere models, assuming that the radiation is uniformly\nemitted by the entire stellar surface. Under this assumption, only the carbon\natmosphere models yield a distance that is compatible with a source located in\nthe Galaxy. In this respect, CXOU J181852.0-150213 is similar to two other\nwell-studied CCOs, the neutron stars in Cas A and in HESS J1731-347, for which\ncarbon atmosphere models were used to reconcile their emission with the known\nor estimated distances.\n", "  Several sets of radially propagating null congruence generators are exploited\nin order to form 3-dimensional marginally trapped surfaces, referred to as\nblack hole and cosmological apparent horizons in a Horava universe. Based on\nthis method, we deal with the characteristics of the 2-dimensional space-like\nspheres of symmetry and the peculiarities of having trapping horizons.\nMoreover, we apply this method in standard expanding and contracting FLRW\ncosmological models of a Horava universe to investigate the conditions under\nwhich the extra parameters of the theory may lead to trapped/anti-trapped\nsurfaces both in the future and in the past. We also include the cases of\nnegative time, referred to as the finite past, and discuss the formation of\nanti-trapped surfaces inside the cosmological apparent horizons.\n", "  We report the first identification of forbidden line components from an\nelement heavier than helium in the spectrum of astrophysical plasmas. As yet,\nthese components were identified only in laboratory plasmas and not in\nastrophysical objects. Forbidden components are well known for neutral helium\nlines in hot stars, particularly in helium-rich post-AGB stars and white\ndwarfs. We discovered that two hitherto unidentified lines in the ultraviolet\nspectra of hot hydrogen-deficient (pre-) white dwarfs can be identified as\nforbidden line components of triply ionized carbon (C IV). The forbidden\ncomponents (3p-4f and 3d-4d) appear in the blue and red wings of the strong,\nStark broadened 3p-4d and 3d-4f lines at 1108 Angstroem and 1169 Angstroem,\nrespectively. They are visible over a wide effective temperature range\n(60,000-200,000 K) in helium-rich (DO) white dwarfs and PG1159 stars that have\nstrongly oversolar carbon abundances.\n", "  A spectral line image cube generated from 115 minutes of MWA data that covers\na field of view of 400 sq. deg. around the Galactic Centre is used to perform\nthe first Search for ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence (SETI) with the Murchison\nWidefield Array. Our work constitutes the first modern SETI experiment at low\nradio frequencies, here between 103 and 133 MHz, paving the way for large-scale\nsearches with the MWA and, in the future, the low frequency Square Kilometre\nArray. Limits of a few hundred mJy/beam for narrow band emission (10 kHz) are\nderived from our data, across our 400 sq. deg. field of view. Within this\nfield, 45 exoplanets in 38 planetary systems are known. We extract spectra at\nthe locations of these systems from our image cube, to place limits on the\npresence of narrow line emission from these systems. We then derive minimum\nisotropic transmitter powers for these exoplanets; a small handful of the\nclosest objects (10s of pc) yield our best limits of order $10^{14}$ W\n(Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power: EIRP). These limits lie above the highest\npower directional transmitters near these frequencies currently operational on\nEarth. A SETI experiment with the MWA covering the full accessible sky and its\nfull frequency range would require approximately one month of observing time.\nThe MWA frequency range, its Southern Hemisphere location on an extraordinarily\nradio quiet site, its very large field of view, and its high sensitivity make\nit a unique facility for SETI.\n", "  We present e-MERLIN 21 cm (L-band) observations of single luminous OB stars\nin the Cygnus OB2 association, from the COBRaS Legacy programme. The radio\nobservations potentially offer the most straightforward, least model-dependent,\ndeterminations of mass-loss rates, and can be used to help resolve current\ndiscrepancies in mass-loss rates via clumped and structured hot star winds. We\nreport here that the 21 cm flux densities of O3 to O6 supergiant and giant\nstars are less than ~ 70 microJy. These fluxes may be translated to `smooth'\nwind mass-loss upper limits of ~ 4.4 - 4.8 x 10^(-6) M_sol/yr for O3\nsupergiants and < 2.9 x 10^(-6) M_sol/yr for B0 to B1 supergiants. The first\never resolved 21 cm detections of the hypergiant (and LBV candidate) Cyg OB2\n#12 are discussed; for multiple observations separated by 14 days, we detect a\n~ 69% increase in its flux density. Our constraints on the upper limits for the\nmass-loss rates of evolved OB stars in Cyg OB2 support the model that the inner\nwind region close to the stellar surface (where Halpha forms) is more clumped\nthan the very extended geometric region sampled by our radio observations.\n", "  As part of the Large Program ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM), we have\nused the IRAM 30m telescope to lead a systematic search for the emission of\nrotational transitions of P-bearing species between 80 and 350 GHz towards\nL1157-B1, a shock position in the solar-type star forming region L1157. We\nreport the detection of several transitions of PN and, for the first time, of\nprebiotic molecule PO. None of these species are detected towards the driving\nprotostar of the outflow L1157-mm. Analysis of the line profiles shows that PN\narises from the outflow cavity, where SiO, a strong shock tracer, is produced.\nRadiative transfer analysis yields an abundance of 2.5e-9 and 0.9e-9 for PO and\nPN, respectively. These results imply a strong depletion (approx 100) of\nPhosphorus in the quiescent cloud gas. Shock modelling shows that atomic N\nplays a major role in the chemistry of PO and PN. The relative abundance of PO\nand PN brings constraints both on the duration of the pre-shock phase, which\nhas to be about 1 Myr, and on the shock parameters. The maximum temperature in\nthe shock has to be larger than 4000K, which implies a shock velocity of 40\nkm/s.\n", "  Modified gravity theories have the potential of explaining the recent\nacceleration of the Universe without resorting to the mysterious concept of\ndark energy. In particular, it has been pointed out that matter-geometry\ncoupling may be responsible for the recent cosmological dynamics of the\nUniverse, and matter itself may play a more fundamental role in the description\nof the gravitational processes that usually assumed. We study the quantum\ncosmology of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, in which the effective Lagrangian of\nthe gravitational field is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar,\nand the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, respectively. For the\nbackground geometry we adopt the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, and we\nassume that matter content of the Universe consists of a perfect fluid. We\nobtain the general form of the gravitational Hamiltonian, of the quantum\npotential, and of the canonical momenta, respectively. This allows us to\nformulate the full Wheeler-de Witt equation describing the quantum properties\nof this modified gravity model. As a specific application we consider in detail\nthe quantum cosmology of the $f(R,T)=F^0(R)+\\theta RT$ model, in which $F^0(R)$\nis an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, and $\\theta $ is a function of\nthe scale factor only. The Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion, and the\nWheeler-de Witt equations are obtained, and a time parameter for the\ncorresponding dynamical system is identified, which allows to formulate the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger--Wheeler--de Witt equation for the quantum-mechanical\ndescription of the model under consideration. A perturbative approach for the\nstudy of this equation is developed, and the energy levels of the Universe are\nobtained by using a twofold degenerate perturbation approach. A second\nquantization approach for the description of quantum time is also proposed, and\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  In search for a synthetic understanding, a scenario for the evolution of the\nstar formation rate and the chemical abundances in galaxies is proposed,\ncombining gas infall from galactic halos, outflow of gas by supernova\nexplosions, and an oscillatory star formation process. The oscillatory star\nformation model is a consequence of the modelling of the fractional masses\nchanges of the hot, warm and cold components of the interstellar medium. The\nobserved periods of oscillation vary in the range $(0.1-3.0)\\times10^{7}$\\,yr\ndepending on various parameters existing from giant to dwarf galaxies. The\nevolution of metallicity varies in giant and dwarf galaxies and depends on the\noutflow process. Observed abundances in dwarf galaxies can be reproduced under\nfast outflow together with slow evaporation of cold gases into hot gas whereas\nslow outflow and fast evaporation is preferred for giant galaxies. The\nvariation of metallicities in dwarf galaxies supports the fact that low rate of\nSNII production in dwarf galaxies is responsible for variation in metallicity\nin dwarf galaxies of similar masses as suggested by various authors.\n", "  Aim: The aim of this work is to search Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4945, a\nwell-known 22 GHz water megamaser galaxy, for water (mega)maser emission at 183\nGHz. Method: We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to perform the observations. Results: We\ndetected 183 GHz water maser emission towards NGC 4945 with a peak flux density\nof ~3 Jy near the galactic systemic velocity. The emission spans a velocity\nrange of several hundred km/s. We estimate an isotropic luminosity of > 1000\nLsun, classifying the emission as a megamaser. A comparison of the 183 GHz\nspectrum with that observed at 22 GHz suggests that 183 GHz emission also\narises from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) central engine. If the 183 GHz\nemission originates from the circumnuclear disk, then we estimate that a\nredshifted feature at 1084 km/s in the spectrum should arise from a distance of\n0.022 pc from the supermassive black hole (1.6 x 10(5) Schwarzschild radii),\ni.e. closer than the water maser emission previously detected at 22 GHz. This\nis only the second time 183 GHz maser emission has been detected towards an AGN\ncentral engine (the other galaxy being NGC 3079). It is also the strongest\nextragalactic millimetre/submillimetre water maser detected to date.\nConclusions: Strong millimetre 183 GHz water maser emission has now been shown\nto occur in an external galaxy. For NGC 4945, we believe that the maser\nemission arises, or is dominated by, emission from the AGN central engine.\nEmission at higher velocity, i.e. for a Keplerian disk closer to the black\nhole, has been detected at 183 GHz compared with that for the 22 GHz megamaser.\nThis indicates that millimetre/submillimetre water masers can indeed be useful\nprobes for tracing out more of AGN central engine structures and dynamics than\npreviously probed. Future observations using ALMA Band 5 should unequivocally\ndetermine the origin of the emission in this and other galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between stellar and gas specific angular\nmomentum $j$, stellar mass $M_{*}$ and optical morphology for a sample of 488\ngalaxies extracted from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. We find that $j$, measured\nwithin one effective radius, monotonically increases with $M_{*}$ and that, for\n$M_{*}>$10$^{9.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$, the scatter in this relation strongly\ncorrelates with optical morphology (i.e., visual classification and S\\'ersic\nindex). These findings confirm that massive galaxies of all types lie on a\nplane relating mass, angular momentum and stellar light distribution, and\nsuggest that the large-scale morphology of a galaxy is regulated by its mass\nand dynamical state. We show that the significant scatter in the $M_{*}-j$\nrelation is accounted for by the fact that, at fixed stellar mass, the\ncontribution of ordered motions to the dynamical support of galaxies varies by\nat least a factor of three. Indeed, the stellar spin parameter (quantified via\n$\\lambda_R$) correlates strongly with S\\'ersic and concentration indices. This\ncorrelation is particularly strong once slow-rotators are removed from the\nsample, showing that late-type galaxies and early-type fast rotators form a\ncontinuous class of objects in terms of their kinematic properties.\n", "  Searches for diphoton resonance have been shown to be very useful in\ndiscovering new heavy spin-0 or spin-2 particles. Supposing that a new heavy\nparticle shows up in the diphoton channel and it points to a spin-0 boson, it\ncan be allowed to have a small mixing with the observed 125 GeV Higgs-like\nboson. We borrow the example of the 750 GeV particles hinted with 3.2 fb$^{-1}$\ndata at the end of 2015 (though it did not appear in the 2016 data) to perform\nan analysis of \"double Higgcision\". In this work, we perform a complete\nHiggs-signal strength analysis in the Higgs-portal type framework, using all\nthe existing 125 GeV Higgs boson data as well as the diphoton signal strength\nof the 750 GeV scalar boson. The best fit prefers a very tiny mixing between\ntwo scalar bosons, which has to be accommodated in models for the 750 GeV\nscalar boson.\n", "  We present the analysis of six nights of spectroscopic monitoring of two\nyoung and fast rotating late-type stars, namely the dMe star HK Aqr and the\ndG/dK star PZ Tel. On both stars we detect absorption features reminiscent of\nsignatures of co-rotating cool clouds or prominences visible in H$\\alpha$.\nSeveral prominences on HK Aqr show periodic variability in the prominence\ntracks which follow a sinusoidal motion (indication of prominence\noscillations). On PZ Tel we could not find any periodic variability in the\nprominence tracks. By fitting sinusoidal functions to the prominence tracks we\nderive amplitudes and periods which are similar to those of large amplitude\noscillations seen in solar prominences. In one specific event we also derive a\nperiodic variation of the prominence track in the H$\\beta$ spectral line which\nshows an anti-phase variation with the one derived for the H$\\alpha$ spectral\nline. Using these parameters and estimated mass density of a prominence on HK\nAqr we derive a minimum magnetic field strength of $\\sim$2G. The relatively low\nstrength of the magnetic field is explained by the large height of this stellar\nprominence ($\\ge$ 0.67 stellar radii above the surface).\n", "  In this work we keep pushing K2 data to a high photometric precision, close\nto that of the Kepler main mission, using a PSF-based, neighbour-subtraction\ntechnique, which also overcome the dilution effects in crowded environments. We\nanalyse the open cluster M 44 (NGC 2632), observed during the K2 Campaign 5,\nand extract light curves of stars imaged on module 14, where most of the\ncluster lies. We present two candidate exoplanets hosted by cluster members and\nfive by field stars. As a by-product of our investigation, we find 1680\neclipsing binaries and variable stars, 1071 of which are new discoveries. Among\nthem, we report the presence of a heartbeat binary star. Together with this\nwork, we release to the community a catalogue with the variable stars and the\ncandidate exoplanets found, as well as all our raw and detrended light curves.\n", "  We report on the recovery of the six old novae EL Aql, V606 Aql, V908 Oph,\nV1149 Sgr, V1583 Sgr and V3964 Sgr, using photometric and spectroscopic data.\nAnalysing several properties, we find that EL Aql is a good candidate for an\nintermediate polar. Furthermore, the system inclination of EL Aql, V606 Aql,\nV1583 Sgr and V3964 Sgr appears to be sufficiently high to suggest them as good\ntargets for time series observations. We also eliminate some previously\nsuggested candidates for the post-novae V1301 Aql and V1151 Sgr.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new subclass of double-mode RR Lyrae stars in\nthe Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. The sample of 22 pulsating stars have\nbeen extracted from the latest edition of the OGLE collection of RR Lyrae\nvariables in the Magellanic System. The stars pulsating simultaneously in the\nfundamental (F) and first-overtone (1O) modes have distinctly different\nproperties than regular double-mode RR Lyrae variables (RRd stars). The\n$P_{1O}/P_F$ period ratios of our anomalous RRd stars are within a range\n0.725-0.738, while \"classical\" double-mode RR Lyrae variables have period\nratios in the range 0.742-0.748. In contrast to the typical RRd stars, in the\nmajority of the anomalous pulsators the F-mode amplitudes are higher than the\n1O-mode amplitudes. The light curves associated with the F-mode in the\nanomalous RRd stars show different morphology than the light curves of, both,\nregular RRd stars and single-mode RRab stars. Most of the anomalous double-mode\nstars show long-term modulations of the amplitudes (Blazhko-like effect).\nTranslating the period ratios into the abundance parameter, Z, we find for our\nstars Z in the range (0.002,0.005) - an order of magnitude higher values than\ntypical for RR Lyrae stars. The mass range of the RRd stars inferred from the\n$W_I$ vs. $P_F$ diagram is (0.55-0.75) of the solar mass. These parameters\ncannot be accounted for with single star evolution assuming a Reimers-like mass\nloss. Much greater mass loss caused by interaction with other stars is\npostulated. We blame the peculiar pulsation properties of our stars to the\nparametric resonance instability of the 1O-mode to excitation of the F- and\n2O-modes as with the inferred parameters of the stars $2\\omega_{\\rm\n1O}\\approx\\omega_{\\rm F}+\\omega_{\\rm 2O}$.\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) project aims to provide a strong scientific\nvision for ground-based optical astronomy beyond the upcoming generation of\nExtremely Large Telescopes. We make the case that a breakthrough in angular\nresolution imaging capabilities is required in order to unravel the processes\ninvolved in planet formation. PFI will be optimised to provide a complete\ncensus of the protoplanet population at all stellocentric radii and over the\nage range from 0.1 to about 100 Myr. Within this age period, planetary systems\nundergo dramatic changes and the final architecture of planetary systems is\ndetermined. Our goal is to study the planetary birth on the natural spatial\nscale where the material is assembled, which is the \"Hill Sphere\" of the\nforming planet, and to characterise the protoplanetary cores by measuring their\nmasses and physical properties. Our science working group has investigated the\nobservational characteristics of these young protoplanets as well as the\nmigration mechanisms that might alter the system architecture. We simulated the\nimprints that the planets leave in the disk and study how PFI could\nrevolutionise areas ranging from exoplanet to extragalactic science. In this\ncontribution we outline the key science drivers of PFI and discuss the\nrequirements that will guide the technology choices, the site selection, and\npotential science/technology tradeoffs.\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) Project has formed a Technical Working\nGroup (TWG) to explore possible facility architectures to meet the primary PFI\nscience goal of imaging planet formation in situ in nearby star- forming\nregions. The goals of being sensitive to dust emission on solar system scales\nand resolving the Hill-sphere around forming giant planets can best be\naccomplished through sub-milliarcsecond imaging in the thermal infrared.\nExploiting the 8-13 micron atmospheric window, a ground-based long-baseline\ninterferometer with approximately 20 apertures including 10km baselines will\nhave the necessary resolution to image structure down 0.1 milliarcseconds\n(0.014 AU) for T Tauri disks in Taurus. Even with large telescopes, this array\nwill not have the sensitivity to directly track fringes in the mid-infrared for\nour prime targets and a fringe tracking system will be necessary in the\nnear-infrared. While a heterodyne architecture using modern mid-IR laser comb\ntechnology remains a competitive option (especially for the intriguing 24 and\n40{\\mu}m atmospheric windows), the prioritization of 3-5{\\mu}m observations of\nCO/H2O vibrotational levels by the PFI-Science Working Group (SWG) pushes the\nTWG to require vacuum pipe beam transport with potentially cooled optics. We\npresent here a preliminary study of simulated L- and N-band PFI observations of\na realistic 4-planet disk simulation, finding 21x2.5m PFI can easily detect the\naccreting protoplanets in both L and N-band but can see non-accreting planets\nonly in L band. (abridged -- see PDF for full abstract)\n", "  The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) project aims to image the period of planet\nassembly directly, resolving structures as small as a giant planet's Hill\nsphere. These images will be required in order to determine the key mechanisms\nfor planet formation at the time when processes of grain growth, protoplanet\nassembly, magnetic fields, disk/planet dynamical interactions and complex\nradiative transfer all interact - making some planetary systems habitable and\nothers inhospitable. We will present the overall vision for the PFI concept,\nfocusing on the key technologies and requirements that are needed to achieve\nthe science goals. Based on these key requirements, we will define a cost\nenvelope range for the design and highlight where the largest uncertainties lie\nat this conceptual stage.\n", "  We present the evolution in the number density and stellar mass functions of\nphotometrically selected post-starburst galaxies in the UKIDSS Deep Survey\n(UDS), with redshifts of 0.5<z<2 and stellar masses logM>10. We find that this\ntransitionary species of galaxy is rare at all redshifts, contributing ~5% of\nthe total population at z~2, to <1% by z~0.5. By comparing the mass functions\nof quiescent galaxies to post-starburst galaxies at three cosmic epochs, we\nshow that rapid quenching of star formation can account for 100% of quiescent\ngalaxy formation, if the post-starburst spectral features are visible for\n~250Myr. The flattening of the low mass end of the quiescent galaxy stellar\nmass function seen at z~1 can be entirely explained by the addition of rapidly\nquenched galaxies. Only if a significant fraction of post-starburst galaxies\nhave features that are visible for longer than 250Myr, or they acquire new gas\nand return to the star-forming sequence, can there be significant growth of the\nred sequence from a slower quenching route. The shape of the mass function of\nthese transitory post-starburst galaxies resembles that of quiescent galaxies\nat z~2, with a preferred stellar mass of logM~10.6, but evolves steadily to\nresemble that of star-forming galaxies at z<1. This leads us to propose a dual\norigin for post-starburst galaxies: (1) at z>2 they are exclusively massive\ngalaxies that have formed the bulk of their stars during a rapid assembly\nperiod, followed by complete quenching of further star formation, (2) at z<1\nthey are caused by the rapid quenching of gas-rich star-forming galaxies,\nindependent of stellar mass, possibly due to environment and/or gas-rich major\nmergers.\n", "  In many ways, the HR 8799 planetary system strongly resembles our own. It\nfeatures four giant planets and two debris belts, analogues to the Asteroid and\nEdgeworth-Kuiper belts. Here, we present the results of dynamical simulations\nof HR 8799's inner debris belt, to study its structure and collisional\nenvironment.\n  Our results suggest that HR 8799's inner belt is highly structured, with gaps\nbetween regions of dynamical stability. The belt is likely constrained between\nsharp inner and outer edges, located at ~6 and ~8 au, respectively. Its inner\nedge coincides with a broad gap cleared by the 4:1 mean-motion resonance with\nHR 8799e.\n  Within the belt, planetesimals are undergoing a process of collisional\nattrition like that observed in the Asteroid belt. However, whilst the mean\ncollision velocity in the Asteroid belt exceeds 5 km/s, the majority of\ncollisions within HR 8799's inner belt occur with velocities of order 1.2 km/s,\nor less. Despite this, they remain sufficiently energetic to be destructive -\ngiving a source for the warm dust detected in the system.\n  Interior to the inner belt, test particles remain dynamically unstirred,\naside from narrow bands excited by distant high-order resonances with HR 8799e.\nThis lack of stirring is consistent with earlier thermal modelling of HR 8799's\ninfrared excess, which predicted little dust inside 6 au. The inner system is\nsufficiently stable and unstirred that the formation of telluric planets is\nfeasible, although such planets would doubtless be subject to a punitive impact\nregime, given the intense collisional grinding required in the inner belt to\ngenerate the observed infrared excess.\n", "  The planet in the WASP-103 system is an excellent candidate for transmission\nspectroscopy because of its large radius and high temperature. Application of\nthis technique found a variation of radius with wavelength which was far too\nstrong to be explained by scattering processes in the planetary atmosphere. A\nfaint nearby star was subsequently detected, whose contamination of the transit\nlight curves might explain this anomaly. We present a reanalysis of published\ndata in order to characterise the faint star and assess its effect on the\nmeasured transmission spectrum. The faint star has a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.08 Msun\nand is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the planetary system. We find\nthat its effect on the measured physical properties of the planet and host star\nis small, amounting to a planetary radius larger by 0.6 sigma and planetary\ndensity smaller by 0.8 sigma. Its influence on the measured transmission\nspectrum is much greater: the spectrum now has a minimum around 760 nm and\nopacity rises to both bluer and redder wavelengths. It is a poor match to\ntheoretical spectra and the spectral slope remains too strong for Rayleigh\nscattering. The existence of the faint nearby star cannot therefore explain the\nmeasured spectral properties of this hot and inflated planet. We advocate\nfurther observations of the system, both with high spatial resolution in order\nto improve the measured properties of the faint star, and with higher spectral\nresolution to confirm the anomalous transmission spectrum of the planet.\n", "  We study the relation between stellar rotation and magnetic activity for a\nsample of 134 bright, nearby M dwarfs observed in the Kepler Two-Wheel (K2)\nmission during campaigns C0 to C4. The K2 lightcurves yield photometrically\nderived rotation periods for 97 stars (79 of which without previous period\nmeasurement), as well as various measures for activity related to cool spots\nand flares. We find a clear difference between fast and slow rotators with a\ndividing line at a period of ~10d at which the activity level changes abruptly.\nAll photometric diagnostics of activity (spot cycle amplitude, flare peak\namplitude and residual variability after subtraction of spot and flare\nvariations) display the same dichotomy, pointing to a quick transition between\na high-activity mode for fast rotators and a low-activity mode for slow\nrotators. This unexplained behavior is reminiscent of a dynamo mode-change seen\nin numerical simulations that separates a dipolar from a multipolar regime. A\nsubstantial number of the fast rotators are visual binaries. A tentative\nexplanation is accelerated disk evolution in binaries leading to higher initial\nrotation rates on the main-sequence and associated longer spin-down and\nactivity lifetimes. We combine the K2 rotation periods with archival X-ray and\nUV data. X-ray, FUV and NUV detections are found for 26, 41, and 11 stars from\nour sample, respectively. Separating the fast from the slow rotators, we\ndetermine for the first time the X-ray saturation level separately for early-\nand for mid-M stars.\n", "  This paper is devoted to study the circumstances favourable to detect Trojan\nplanets in close binary-star-systems by the help of eclipse timing variations\n(ETVs). To determine the probability of the detection of such variations with\nground based telescopes and space telescopes (like former missions CoRoT and\nKepler and future space missions like Plato, Tess and Cheops), we investigated\nthe dynamics of binary star systems with a planet in tadpole motion. We did\nnumerical simulations by using the full three-body problem as dynamical model.\nThe stability and the ETVs are investigated by computing stability/ETV maps for\ndifferent masses of the secondary star and the Trojan planet. In addition we\nchanged the eccentricity of the possible Trojan planet. By the help of the\nlibration amplitude $\\sigma$ we could show whether or not all stable objects\nare moving in tadpole orbits. We can conclude that many amplitudes of ETVs are\nlarge enough to detect Earth-like Trojan planets in binary star systems. As an\napplication, we prepared a list of possible candidates.\n", "  We present a study of the complete ultraviolet to submillimetre spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of twelve 3CR radio galaxy hosts in the redshift\nrange $1.0 < z < 2.5$, which were all detected in the far-infrared by the\nHerschel Space Observatory. The study employs the new spectro-chemical\nevolutionary code P\\'EGASE.3, in combination with recently published clumpy AGN\ntorus models. We uncover the properties of the massive host galaxy stellar\npopulations, the AGN torus luminosities, and the properties of the recent\nstarbursts, which had earlier been inferred in these objects from their\ninfrared SEDs. The P\\'EGASE.3 fitting yields very luminous (up to\n10$^{13}$L$_{\\odot}$) young stellar populations with ages of several hundred\nmillion years in hosts with masses exceeding 10$^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$. Dust masses\nare seen to increase with redshift, and a surprising correlation -- or better\nupper envelope behaviour -- is found between the AGN torus luminosity and the\nstarburst luminosity, as revealed by their associated dust components. The\nlatter consistently exceeds the former by a constant factor, over a range of\none order of magnitude in both quantities.\n", "  The four-color ($B$ $V$ $R_c$ $I_c$) light curves of V776 Cas are presented\nand analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney (W-D) method. It is discovered that V776\nCas is an early F-type (F2V) overcontact binary with a very high contact degree\n($ f=64.6\\,\\%$) and an extremely low mass ratio ($q=0.130$), which indicate\nthat it is at the final evolutionary stage of cool short-period binaries. The\nmass of the primary and secondary stars are calculated to be $M_1 =\n1.55(\\pm0.04)M_\\odot$, $M_2 = 0.20(\\pm0.01)M_\\odot$. V776 Cas is supposed to be\nformed from an initially detached binary system via the loss of angular\nmomentum due to the magnetic wind. The initial mass of the present primary and\nsecondary components are calculated to be $M_{1i} = 0.86(\\pm0.10)M_\\odot$ and\n$M_{2i} = 2.13(\\pm0.04)M_\\odot$. The observed-calculated ($O$-$C$) curve\nexhibits a cyclic period variation, which is due to the light-travel time\neffect (LTTE) caused by the presence of a third component with a period of 23.7\nyears. The mass of the third component is estimated to be $M_3 =\n1.04(\\pm0.03)M_\\odot$ and the orbital inclination of the third component is\ncalculated to be $i' = 33.1^{\\circ}$. The distance of the binary system to the\nmass center of the triple system is calculated to be $a'_{12} = 3.45AU$. The\npresence of the close-in tertiary component may play an important role in the\nformation and evolution of this binary system by drawing angular momentum from\nthe central system.\n", "  The 2015 March 15 coronal mass ejection as one of the two that together drove\nthe largest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 24 so far was associated with\nsympathetic filament eruptions. We investigate the relations between the\ndifferent filaments involved in the eruption. A surge-like small-scale filament\nmotion is confirmed as the trigger that initiated the erupting filament with\nmulti-wavelength observations and using a forced magnetic field extrapolation\nmethod. When the erupting filament moved to an open magnetic field region, it\nexperienced an obvious acceleration process and was accompanied by a C-class\nflare and the rise of another larger filament that eventually failed to erupt.\nWe measure the decay index of the background magnetic field, which presents a\ncritical height of 118 Mm. Combining with a potential field source surface\nextrapolation method, we analyze the distributions of the large-scale magnetic\nfield, which indicates that the open magnetic field region may provide a\nfavorable condition for F2 rapid acceleration and have some relation with the\nlargest solar storm. The comparison between the successful and failed filament\neruptions suggests that the confining magnetic field plays an important role in\nthe preconditions for an eruption.\n", "  RWT 152 is one of the few known planetary nebulae with an sdO central star.\nWe present subarcsecond red tunable filter Halpha imaging and\nintermediate-resolution, long-slit spectroscopy of RWT 152 obtained with\nOSIRIS/GTC with the goal of analyzing its properties. The Halpha image reveals\na bipolar nebula with a bright equatorial region and multiple bubbles in the\nmain lobes. A faint circular halo surrounds the main nebula. The nebular\nspectra reveal a very low-excitation nebula with weak emission lines from H^+,\nHe^+, and double-ionized metals, and absence of emission lines from neutral and\nsingle-ionized metals, except for an extremely faint [NII]6584 emission line.\nThese spectra may be explained if RWT 152 is a density-bounded planetary\nnebula. Low nebular chemical abundances of S, O, Ar, N, and Ne are obtained in\nRWT 152, which, together with the derived high peculiar velocity ($\\sim$ 92-131\nkm s$^{-1}$), indicate that this object is a halo planetary nebula. The\navailable data are consistent with RWT 152 evolving from a low-mass progenitor\n($\\sim$ 1 M$_{\\odot}$) formed in a metal-poor environment.\n", "  Here, we model the effect of non-uniform dynamical mass distributions and\ntheir associated gravitational fields on the stationary galactic superwind\nsolution. We do this by considering an analogue injection of mass and energy\nfrom stellar winds and SNe. We consider both compact dark-matter and baryonic\nhaloes that does not extend further from the galaxies optical radii $R_{\\rm\nopt}$ as well as extended gravitationally-interacting ones. We consider halo\nprofiles that emulate the results of recent cosmological simulations and\ncoincide also with observational estimations from galaxy surveys. This allows\nto compare the analytical superwind solution with outflows from different kinds\nof galaxies. We give analytical formulae that establish when an outflow is\npossible and also characterize distinct flow regimes and enrichment scenarios.\nWe also constraint the parameter space by giving approximate limits above which\ngravitation, self-gravitation and radiative cooling can inhibit the stationary\nflow. We obtain analytical expressions for the free superwind hydrodynamical\nprofiles. We find that the existence or inhibition of the superwind solution\nhighly depends on the steepness and concentration of the dynamical mass and the\nmass and energy injection rates. We compare our results with observational data\nand a recent numerical work. We put our results in the context of the\nmass-metallicity relationship to discuss observational evidence related to the\nselective loss of metals from the least massive galaxies and also discuss the\ncase of massive galaxies.\n", "  The phenomenological Disc Instability Model has been successful in\nreproducing the observed light curves of dwarf nova outbursts by invoking an\nenhanced Shakura-Sunyaev $\\alpha$ parameter $\\sim0.1-0.2$ in outburst compared\nto a low value $\\sim0.01$ in quiescence. Recent thermodynamically consistent\nsimulations of magnetorotational (MRI) turbulence with appropriate opacities\nand equation of state for dwarf nova accretion discs have found that thermal\nconvection enhances $\\alpha$ in discs in outburst, but only near the hydrogen\nionization transition. At higher temperatures, convection no longer exists and\n$\\alpha$ returns to the low value comparable to that in quiescence. In order to\ncheck whether this enhancement near the hydrogen ionization transition is\nsufficient to reproduce observed light curves, we incorporate this MRI-based\nvariation in $\\alpha$ into the Disc Instability Model, as well as\nsimulation-based models of turbulent dissipation and convective transport.\nThese MRI-based models can successfully reproduce observed outburst and\nquiescence durations, as well as outburst amplitudes, albeit with different\nparameters from the standard Disc Instability Models. The MRI-based model\nlightcurves exhibit reflares in the decay from outburst, which are not\ngenerally observed in dwarf novae. However, we highlight the problematic\naspects of the quiescence physics in the Disc Instability Model and MRI\nsimulations that are responsible for this behavior.\n", "  The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect is the principal method of determining the\nsky-projected spin--orbit angle ($\\beta$) of transiting planets. Taking the\nexample of the recently discovered TRAPPIST-1 system, we explore how ultracool\ndwarfs facilitate the measurement of the spin--orbit angle for Earth-sized\nplanets by creating an effect that can be an order of magnitude more ample than\nthe Doppler reflex motion caused by the planet if the star is undergoing rapid\nrotation. In TRAPPIST-1's case we expect the semi-amplitudes of the\nRossiter-McLaughlin effect to be $40-50$ m/s for the known transiting planets.\nAccounting for stellar jitter expected for ultracool dwarfs, instrumental\nnoise, and assuming radial velocity precisions both demonstrated and\nanticipated for upcoming near-infrared spectrographs, we quantify the\nobservational effort required to measure the planets' masses and spin--orbit\nangles. We conclude that if the planetary system is well-aligned then $\\beta$\ncan be measured to a precision of $\\lesssim 10^{\\circ}$ if the spectrograph is\nstable at the level of 2 m/s. We also investigate the measure of $\\Delta\n\\beta$, the mutual inclination, when multiple transiting planets are present in\nthe system. Lastly, we note that the rapid rotation rate of many late M-dwarfs\nwill amplify the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal to the point where variations in\nthe chromatic Rossiter-McLaughlin effect from atmospheric absorbers should be\ndetectable.\n", "  The present study reports the discovery of Sun-like stars, namely\nmain-sequence stars with $T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$ and rotation periods $P_{rot}$\nsimilar to solar values, presenting evidence of surface differential rotation.\nAn autocorrelation of the time series was used to select stars presenting\nphotometric signal stability from a sample of 881 stars with light curves\ncollected by the $Kepler$ space-borne telescope, in which we have identified 17\nstars with stable signals. A simple two-spot model together with a Bayesian\ninformation criterion were applied to these stars in the search for indications\nof differential rotation; in addition, for all 17 stars, it was possible to\ncompute the spot rotation period $P$, the mean values of the individual spot\nrotation periods and their respective colatitudes, and the relative amplitude\nof the differential rotation.\n", "  Galaxy modelling is greatly simplified by assuming the existence of a global\nsystem of angle-action coordinates. Unfortunately, global angle-action\ncoordinates do not exist because some orbits become trapped by resonances,\nespecially where the radial and vertical frequencies coincide. We show that in\na realistic Galactic potential such trapping occurs only on thick-disc and halo\norbits (speed relative to the guiding centre >~80 km/s). We explain how the\nTorus Mapper code (TM) behaves in regions of phase space in which orbits are\nresonantly trapped, and we extend TM so trapped orbits can be manipulated as\neasily as untrapped ones. The impact that the resonance has on the structure of\nvelocity space depends on the weights assigned to trapped orbits. The impact is\neverywhere small if each trapped orbit is assigned the phase space density\nequal to the time average along the orbit of the DF for untrapped orbits. The\nimpact could be significant with a different assignment of weights to trapped\norbits.\n", "  The InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) will be the first light adaptive\noptics instrument on the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS is being built by a\ncollaboration between Caltech, the University of California, NAOJ and NRC\nHerzberg. We present novel aspects of the Support Structure, Rotator and\nOn-Instrument Wavefront Sensor systems being developed at NRC Herzberg. IRIS is\nsuspended from the bottom port of the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics\nSystem (NFIRAOS), and provides its own image de-rotation to compensate for\nsidereal rotation of the focal plane. This arrangement is a challenge because\nNFIRAOS is designed to host two other science instruments, which imposes strict\nmass requirements on IRIS. We have been tasked with keeping the instrument mass\nunder seven tonnes which has resulted in a mass reduction of 30 percent for the\nsupport structure and rotator compared to the most recent IRIS designs. To\naccomplish this goal, while still being able to withstand earthquakes, we\ndeveloped a new design with composite materials. As IRIS is a client instrument\nof NFIRAOS, it benefits from NFIRAOS's superior AO correction. IRIS assists\nthis correction by sensing low-order aberrations with an On-Instrument\nWavefront Sensor (OIWFS). The OIWFS consists of three independently positioned\nnatural guide star wavefront sensors that patrol a 2-arcminute field of view.\nWe expect tip-tilt measurements from faint stars within the IRIS imager focal\nplane will further stabilize the delivered image quality. We describe how the\nuse of On-Detector Guide Windows (ODGWs) in the IRIS imager can be incorporated\ninto the AO correction. Finally, we present our strategies for acquiring and\ntracking sources with this complex AO system, and for mitigating and measuring\nthe various potential sources of image blur and misalignment due to properties\nof the mechanical structure and interfaces. (Abridged)\n", "  The InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) will be a first-light client\ninstrument for the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS) on\nthe Thirty Meter Telescope. IRIS includes three configurable tip/tilt (TT) or\ntip/tilt/focus (TTF) On-Instrument Wavefront Sensors (OIWFS). These sensors are\npositioned over natural guide star (NGS) asterisms using movable\npolar-coordinate pick-off arms (POA) that patrol an approximately 2-arcminute\ncircular field-of-view (FOV). The POAs are capable of colliding with one\nanother, so an algorithm for coordinated motion that avoids contact is\nrequired. We have adopted an approach in which arm motion is evaluated using\nthe gradient descent of a scalar potential field that includes an attractive\ncomponent towards the goal configuration (locations of target stars), and\nrepulsive components to avoid obstacles (proximity to adjacent arms). The\nresulting vector field is further modified by adding a component transverse to\nthe repulsive gradient to avoid problematic local minima in the potential. We\npresent path planning simulations using this computationally inexpensive\ntechnique, which exhibit smooth and efficient trajectories.\n", "  Global gradients for cosmic-ray (CR) protons in the heliosphere are computed\nwith a comprehensive modulation model for the recent prolonged solar minimum of\nCycle 23/24. Fortunately, the PAMELA (Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration\nand Light-nuclei Astrophysics) and Ulysses/KET (Kiel Electron Telescope)\ninstruments simultaneously observed proton intensities for the period between\nJuly 2006 and June 2009. Radial and latitudinal gradients are calculated from\nmeasurements, with the latter possible because Ulysses changed its position\nsignificantly in the heliocentric meridional plane during this period. The\nmodulation model is set up for the conditions that prevailed during this\nunusual solar minimum period to gain insight into the role role that particle\ndrifts played in establishing the observed gradients for this period. Four\nyear-end PAMELA proton spectra were reproduced with the model, from 2006 to\n2009, followed by corresponding radial profiles that were computed along the\nVoyager-1 trajectory, and compared to available observations. It is found that\nthe computed intensity levels are in agreement with solar minimum observations\nfrom Voyager-1 at multiple energies. The model also reproduces the steep\nintensity increase observed when Voyager-1 crossed the heliopause region. Good\nagreement is found between computed and observed latitudinal gradients so that\nwe conclude that the model gives a most reasonable representation of modulation\nconditions from the Earth to the heliopause for the period from 2006 to 2009.\nAs a characteristic feature of CR drifts, the most negative latitudinal\ngradient is computed for 2009, with a value of -0.15%/degree around 600 MV. The\nmaximum radial gradient in the inner heliosphere (as covered by Ulysses) also\noccurs in this range, with the highest value of 4.25%/AU in 2009.\n", "  Using the PACS and SPIRE spectrometers on-board the Herschel Space\nObservatory, we obtained spectra of two red supergiants (RSGs) in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC). Multiple rotational CO emission lines (J=6-5 to 15-14)\nand 15 H2O lines were detected from IRAS 05280-6910, and one CO line was\ndetected from WOH G64. This is the first time CO rotational lines have been\ndetected from evolved stars in the LMC. Their CO line intensities are as strong\nas those of the Galactic RSG, VY CMa. Modelling the CO lines and the spectral\nenergy distribution results in an estimated mass-loss rate for IRAS 05280-6910\nof 3x10^-4 Msun per yr. The model assumes a gas-to-dust ratio and a CO-to-H2\nabundance ratio is estimated from the Galactic values scaled by the LMC\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]~-0.3), i.e., that the CO-to-dust ratio is constant for\nGalactic and LMC metallicities within the uncertainties of the model. The key\nfactor determining the CO line intensities and the mass-loss rate found to be\nthe stellar luminosity.\n", "  Although the majority of Centaurs are thought to have originated in the\nscattered disk, with the high-inclination members coming from the Oort cloud,\nthe origin of the high inclination component of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs)\nremains uncertain. We report the discovery of a retrograde TNO, which we\nnickname \"Niku\", detected by the Pan-STARRS 1 Outer Solar System Survey. Our\nnumerical integrations show that the orbital dynamics of Niku are very similar\nto that of 2008 KV$_{42}$ (Drac), with a half-life of $\\sim 500$ Myr. Comparing\nsimilar high inclination TNOs and Centaurs ($q > 10$ AU, $a < 100$ AU and $i >\n60^\\circ$), we find that these objects exhibit a surprising clustering of\nascending node, and occupy a common orbital plane. This orbital configuration\nhas high statistical significance: 3.8-$\\sigma$. An unknown mechanism is\nrequired to explain the observed clustering. This discovery may provide a\npathway to investigate a possible reservoir of high-inclination objects.\n", "  The emission from black hole binaries (BHBs) and active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) displays significant aperiodic variabilities. The most promising\nexplanation for these variabilities is the propagating fluctuations in the\naccretion flow. It is natural to expect that the mechanism driving\nvariabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in a black hole hyper-accretion\ndisk, which is believed to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We study the\nvariabilities of jet power in GRBs based on the model of propagating\nfluctuations. It is found that the variabilities of jet power and the temporal\nprofile of erratic spikes in this scenario are similar to those in observed\nlight curves of prompt gamma-ray emission of GRBs. Our results show that the\nmechanism driving X-ray variabilities in BHBs and AGNs may operate in the\ncentral engine to drive the variabilities of GRBs.\n", "  The first station of the Long Wavelength Array (LWA1) was used to study\nPSR~B0031-07 with simultaneous observations at 38 and 74~MHz. We found that 158\n(0.35\\%) of the observed pulses at 38~MHz and 221 (0.49\\%) of the observed\npulses at 74~MHz qualified as giant pulses in a total of 12 hours of\nobservations. Giant pulses are defined as having flux densities of a factor of\n$\\geq$ 90 times that of an average pulse at 38~MHz and $\\geq$ 80 times that of\nan average pulse at 74~MHz. The cumulative distribution of pulse strength\nfollows a power law, with an index of $-$4.2 at 38~MHz and $-$4.9 at 74~MHz.\nThis distribution has a much more gradual slope than would be expected if\nobserving the tail of a Gaussian distribution of normal pulses. The dispersion\nmeasure value which resulted in the largest signal-to-noise for dedispersed\npulses was DM $=10.9$~pc~cm$^{-3}$. No other transient pulses were detected in\nthe data in the wide dispersion measure range from 1 to 5000~pc~cm$^{-3}$.\nThere were 12 giant pulses detected within the same period from both 38 and\n74~MHz, meaning that the majority of them are not generated in a wide band.\n", "  Sulfur-bearing molecules are highly reactive in the gas phase of the ISM.\nHowever, the form in which most of the sulfur is locked onto interstellar dust\ngrains is unknown. By taking advantage of the short time-scales of shocks in\nyoung molecular outflows, one could track back the main form of sulfur in the\nices. In this paper, six transitions of H$_2$S and its isotopologues in the\nL1157-B1 bowshock have been detected using data from the Herschel-CHESS survey\nand the IRAM-30m ASAI large program. These detections are used to calculate the\nproperties of H$_2$S gas in L1157-B1 through use of a rotation diagram and to\nexplore the possible carriers of sulfur on the grains. The isotopologue\ndetections allow the first calculation of the H$_2$S deuteration fraction in an\noutflow from a low mass protostar. The fractional abundance of H$_2$S in the\nregion is found to be 6.0$\\times$10$^{-7}$ and the deuteration fraction is\n2$\\times$10$^{-2}$. In order to investigate the form of sulfur on the grains, a\nchemical model is run with four different networks, each with different\nbranching ratios for the freeze out of sulfur bearing species into molecules\nsuch as OCS and H$_2$S. It is found that the model best fits the data when at\nleast half of each sulfur bearing species hydrogenates when freezing. We\ntherefore conclude that a significant fraction of sulfur in L1157-B1 is likely\nto be locked in H$_2$S on the grains.\n", "  A phase transformation in a metastable phase can be affected when it is\nsubjected to a high intensity ultrasound wave. In this study we determined the\neffect of oscillation in pressure and temperature on a phase transformation\nusing the Gibbs droplet model in a generic format. The developed model is valid\nfor both equilibrium and non-equilibrium clusters formed through a stationary\nor non-stationary process. We validated the underlying model by comparing the\npredicted kinetics of water droplet formation from the gas phase against\nexperimental data in the absence of ultrasound. Our results demonstrated better\nagreement with experimental data in comparison with classical nucleation\ntheory. Then, we determined the thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleation and\nthe early stage of growth of clusters in an isothermal sonocrystallisation\nprocess. This new contribution shows that the effect of pressure on the\nkinetics of nucleation is cluster size-dependent in contrast to classical\nnucleation theory.\n", "  The formation of stars occurs in the dense molecular cloud phase of the\ninterstellar medium. Observations and numerical simulations of molecular clouds\nhave shown that supersonic magnetised turbulence plays a key role for the\nformation of stars. Simulations have also shown that a large fraction of the\nturbulent energy dissipates in shock waves. The three families of MHD shocks\n--- fast, intermediate and slow --- distinctly compress and heat up the\nmolecular gas, and so provide an important probe of the physical conditions\nwithin a turbulent cloud. Here we introduce the publicly available algorithm,\nSHOCKFIND, to extract and characterise the mixture of shock families in MHD\nturbulence. The algorithm is applied to a 3-dimensional simulation of a\nmagnetised turbulent molecular cloud, and we find that both fast and slow MHD\nshocks are present in the simulation. We give the first prediction of the\nmixture of turbulence-driven MHD shock families in this molecular cloud, and\npresent their distinct distributions of sonic and Alfvenic Mach numbers. Using\nsubgrid one-dimensional models of MHD shocks we estimate that ~0.03 % of the\nvolume of a typical molecular cloud in the Milky Way will be shock heated above\n50 K, at any time during the lifetime of the cloud. We discuss the impact of\nthis shock heating on the dynamical evolution of molecular clouds.\n", "  Broad emission lines is a prominent property of type I quasi-stellar objects\n(QSOs). The origin of the Baldwin effect for \\civ $\\lambda1549~$\\AA\\ broad\nemission lines, i.e., the luminosity dependence of the \\civ equivalent width\n(EW), is not clearly established. Using a sample of 87 low-$z$ Palomar-Green\n(PG) QSOs and 126 high-$z$ QSOs across the widest possible ranges of redshift\n($0<z<5$), we consistently calculate \\hb-based single-epoch supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) mass and the Eddington ratio to investigate the underlying driver\nof the \\civ Baldwin effect. An empirical formula to estimate the host fraction\nin the continuum luminosity at 5100 \\AA\\ is presented and used in \\hb-based\n\\mbh calculation for low-$z$ PG QSOs. It is found that, for low-$z$ PG QSOs,\nthe Eddington ratio has strong correlations with PC1 and PC2 from the principal\ncomponent analysis, and \\civ EW has a strong correlation with the optical \\feii\nstrength or PC1. Expanding the luminosity range with high-$z$ QSOs, it is found\nthat \\civ Baldwin effect exists in our QSOs sample. Using \\hb-based\nsingle-epoch SMBH mass for our QSOs sample, it is found that \\civ EW has a\nstrong correlation with the Eddington ratio, which is stronger than that with\nthe SMBH mass. It implies that the Eddington ratio seems to be a better\nunderlying parameter than the SMBH mass to drive the \\civ Baldwin effect.\n", "  Recent studies of the Milky Way and its satellites have paid special\nattention to the importance of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars due to\ntheir involvement in Galactic formation history and their possible connection\nwith the chemical elements originating in the first stellar generation. In an\nongoing study of red giants in the Sculptor dwarf galaxy we have discovered a\nstar with extremely strong CN and CH molecular bands. This star, Scl-1013644,\nhas previously been identified by Geisler et al. (2005) as a star with an\nenrichment in the heavy elements. Spectrum synthesis has been used to derive\nthe carbon, nitrogen and barium abundances for Scl-1013644. Our findings are\n[C/Fe] = +0.8, [N/Fe] = -0.3 and [Ba/Fe] = +2.1 with the latter result\nconsistent with the value found by Geisler et al. (2005). These results reveal\nScl-1013644 as a CEMP-s star, the third such star discovered in this dwarf\ngalaxy.\n", "  Multi-colour broad-band transit observations offer the opportunity to\ncharacterise the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet with small- to medium-sized\ntelescopes. One of the most favourable targets is the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32 b.\nWe combined 21 new transit observations of this planet with 36 previously\npublished light curves for a homogeneous analysis of the broad-band\ntransmission spectrum from the Sloan u' band to the Sloan z' band. Our results\nrule out cloud-free planetary atmosphere models of solar metallicity.\nFurthermore, a discrepancy at reddest wavelengths to previously published\nresults makes a recent tentative detection of a scattering feature less likely.\nInstead, the available spectral measurements of HAT-P-32 b favour a completely\nflat spectrum from the near-UV to the near-IR. A plausible interpretation is a\nthick cloud cover at high altitudes.\n", "  Stationary entanglement in a four-mode optomechanical system, especially\nunder roomtemperature, is discussed. In this scheme, when the coupling\nstrengths between the two target modes and the mechanical resonator are equal,\nthe results cannot be explained by the Bogoliubov mode- based scheme. This is\nrelated to the idea of quantum-mechanics-free subspace, which plays an\nimportant role when the thermal noise of the mechanical modes is considered.\nSignificantly prominent steady-state entanglement can be available under\nroom-temperature.\n", "  We point out that the very existence of a \"horizontal branch\" in the\nmass-radius characteristics for neutron stars indicates a strong first-order\nphase transition and thus supports the existence of a critical endpoint (CEP)\nof first order phase transitions in the QCD phase diagram. This branch would\nsample a sequence of hybrid stars with quark matter core, leading to the\nendpoint of stable compact star configurations with the highest possible baryon\ndensities. Since we know of the existence of compact stars with $2M_\\odot$,\nthis hypothetical branch has to lie in the vicinity of this mass value, if it\nexists. We report here a correlation between the maximal radius of the\nhorizontal branch and the pressure at the onset of hadron-to-quark matter phase\ntransition which is likely to be a universal quantity of utmost relevance to\nthe upcoming experiments with heavy-ion collisions at NICA and FAIR.\n", "  Heartbeat stars are eccentric (e > 0.2) ellipsoidal variables whose light\ncurves resemble a cardiogram. We present the observations and corresponding\nmodel of KIC 3749404, a highly eccentric (e = 0.66), short period (P = 20.3 d)\nheartbeat star with tidally induced pulsations. A binary star model was created\nusing PHOEBE, which we modified to include tidally induced pulsations and\nDoppler boosting. The morphology of the photometric periastron variation\n(heartbeat) depends strongly on the eccentricity, inclination and argument of\nperiastron. We show that the inclusion of tidally induced pulsations in the\nmodel significantly changes the parameter values, specifically the inclination\nand those parameters dependent on it. Furthermore, we determine the rate of\napsidal advance by modelling the periastron variation at the beginning and end\nof the 4-yr Kepler data set and dividing by the elapsed time. We compare the\nmodel with the theoretical expectations for classical and general relativistic\napsidal motion and find the observed rate to be two orders of magnitude greater\nthan the theoretical rate. We find that the observed rate cannot be explained\nby tidally induced pulsations alone and consequently hypothesise the presence\nof a third body in the system.\n", "  We exploit the 7 Ms \\textit{Chandra} observations in the \\chandra\\,Deep\nField-South (\\mbox{CDF-S}), the deepest X-ray survey to date, coupled with\nCANDELS/GOODS-S data, to measure the total X-ray emission arising from 2076\ngalaxies at $3.5\\leq z < 6.5$. This aim is achieved by stacking the\n\\textit{Chandra} data at the positions of optically selected galaxies, reaching\neffective exposure times of $\\geq10^9\\mathrm{s}$. We detect significant\n($>3.7\\sigma$) X-ray emission from massive galaxies at $z\\approx4$. We also\nreport the detection of massive galaxies at $z\\approx5$ at a $99.7\\%$\nconfidence level ($2.7\\sigma$), the highest significance ever obtained for\nX-ray emission from galaxies at such high redshifts. No significant signal is\ndetected from galaxies at even higher redshifts. The stacking results place\nconstraints on the BHAD associated with the known high-redshift galaxy samples,\nas well as on the SFRD at high redshift, assuming a range of prescriptions for\nX-ray emission due to X- ray binaries. We find that the X-ray emission from our\nsample is likely dominated by processes related to star formation. Our results\nshow that low-rate mass accretion onto SMBHs in individually X-ray-undetected\ngalaxies is negligible, compared with the BHAD measured for samples of X-ray\ndetected AGN, for cosmic SMBH mass assembly at high redshift. We also place,\nfor the first time, constraints on the faint-end of the AGN X-ray luminosity\nfunction ($\\mathrm{logL_X\\sim42}$) at $z>4$, with evidence for fairly flat\nslopes. The implications of all of these findings are discussed in the context\nof the evolution of the AGN population at high redshift.\n", "  We present a study of nearby galaxies as a function of their [3.4]-[4.6]\ncolour. Galaxies that are red in their [3.4]-[4.6] colour contain heated dust\nand the reddest systems ([3.4]-[4.6] > 0.5) are classified as AGN by some\nselection criteria. The sample discussed here includes nearby galaxies selected\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) that are also in the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalogue. We calculate the number density of\ngalaxies, in the form of the luminosity and mass functions, using the V/Vmax\nmethod and a Stepwise Maximum Likelihood method that has been modified to\naccount for the additional colour selection. The reddest galaxies which have\n[3.4]-[4.6] > 0.8 and are sometimes classified as AGN by their colour, make up\n0.2% of nearby galaxies. However, the reddest galaxies are a rising fraction of\nthe low mass galaxy population. Identifying the lowest mass (M < 10$^{8}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ ) red ([3.4]-[4.6] > 0.8) galaxies as AGN is surprising given that\nnone are optical AGN or composites, in contrast with their more massive (M >\n10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ ) red galaxy counter- parts that are dominated by optical\nAGN and composites (86.4%). We also show that these low mass red galaxies are\nassociated with higher specific star formation rates than their bluer\ncounterparts. While the properties of this relatively rare segment of nearby\nlow-mass galaxies are intriguing, particularly if they are associated with AGN\nactivity, there is not yet enough evidence to determine whether it is AGN or\nunusual star formation that is driving red colours in these systems.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab aims at measuring the neutrinoless conversion\nof a negative muon into an electron and reach a single event sensitivity of\n2.5x10^{-17} after three years of data taking. The monoenergetic electron\nproduced in the final state, is detected by a high precision tracker and a\ncrystal calorimeter, all embedded in a large superconducting solenoid (SD)\nsurrounded by a cosmic ray veto system. The calorimeter is complementary to the\ntracker, allowing an independent trigger and powerful particle identification,\nwhile seeding the track reconstruction and contributing to remove background\ntracks mimicking the signal. In order to match these requirements, the\ncalorimeter should have an energy resolution of O(5)% and a time resolution\nbetter than 500 ps at 100 MeV. The baseline solution is a calorimeter composed\nof two disks of BaF2 crystals read by UV extended, solar blind, Avalanche\nPhotodiode (APDs), which are under development from a JPL, Caltech, RMD\nconsortium. In this paper, the calorimeter design, the R&D studies carried out\nso far and the status of engineering are described. A backup alternative setup\nconsisting of a pure CsI crystal matrix read by UV extended Hamamatsu MPPC's is\nalso presented.\n", "  We present results from a joint Xmm-Newton/NuSTAR monitoring of the Seyfert 1\nNGC 4593, consisting of 5x20 ks simultaneous observations spaced by two days,\nperformed in January 2015. The source is variable, both in flux and spectral\nshape, on time-scales down to a few ks and with a clear softer-when-brighter\nbehaviour. In agreement with past observations, we find the presence of a warm\nabsorber well described by a two-phase ionized outflow. The source exhibits a\ncold, narrow and constant Fe K alpha line at 6.4 keV, and a broad component is\nalso detected. The broad-band (0.3-79 keV) spectrum is well described by a\nprimary power law with Gamma=1.6-1.8 and an exponential cut-off varying from\n90(+40,-20) keV to >700 keV, two distinct reflection components, and a variable\nsoft excess correlated with the primary power law. This campaign shows that\nprobing the variability of Seyfert 1 galaxies on different time-scales is of\nprime importance to investigate the high-energy emission of AGNs.\n", "  We report on radio and X-ray monitoring observations of the BHC Swift\nJ1753.5-0127 taken over a ~10 year period. Presented are daily radio\nobservations at 15 GHz with the AMI-LA and X-ray data from Swift XRT and BAT.\nAlso presented is a deep 2hr JVLA observation taken in an unusually\nlow-luminosity soft-state (with a low disk temperature). We show that although\nthe source has remained relatively radio-quiet compared to XRBs with a similar\nX-ray luminosity in the hard-state, the power-law relationship scales as\n$\\zeta=0.96\\pm0.06$ i.e. slightly closer to what has been considered for\nradiatively inefficient accretion disks. We also place the most stringent limit\nto date on the radio-jet quenching in an XRB soft-state, showing the connection\nof the jet quenching to the X-ray power-law component; the radio flux in the\nsoft-state was found to be $<21~\\mu$Jy, which is a quenching factor of\n$\\gtrsim25$\n", "  We consider the origins of enigmatic stellar populations in four Local Group\ngalactic nuclei, specifically the Milky Way, M31, M32 and M33. These are\ncentrally concentrated blue stars, found in three out of the four nuclear star\nclusters (NSCs) considered here. Their origins are unknown, but could include\nblue straggler (BS) stars, extended horizontal branch stars and young recently\nformed stars. Here, we calculate order-of-magnitude estimates for various\ncollision rates, as a function of the host NSC environment and distance from\nthe cluster centre. These rates are sufficiently high that BSs, formed via\ncollisions between main sequence (MS) stars, could contribute non-negligibly\n($\\sim$ 1-10% in mass) to every surface brightness profile, with the exception\nof the Milky Way. Stellar evolution models show that the envelopes of red giant\nbranch (RGB) stars must be nearly completely stripped to significantly affect\ntheir photometric appearance, which requires multiple collisions. Hence, the\ncollision rates for individual RGB stars are only sufficiently high in the\ninner $\\lesssim$ 0.1 pc of M31 and M32 for RGB destruction to occur. Collisions\nbetween white dwarfs and MS stars, which should ablate the stars, could offer a\nsteady and significant supply of gas in every NSC in our sample. The gas could\neither fragment to form new stars, or accrete onto old MS stars already\npresent. Thus, collisional processes could contribute significantly to the\nobserved blue excesses in M31 and M33; future studies should be aimed at better\nconstraining theoretical predictions to compliment existing and future\nobservational data.\n", "  We have detected a 12 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ planet orbiting in or near the habitable\nzone of a main-sequence A star via the pulsational phase shifts induced by\norbital motion. The planet has an orbital period of $840\\pm20$ d and an\neccentricity of 0.15. All known planets orbiting main-sequence A stars have\nbeen found via the transit method or by direct imaging. The absence of\nastrometric or radial-velocity detections of planets around these hosts makes\nours the first discovery using the orbital motion. It is also the first A star\nknown to host a planet within 1$\\sigma$ of the habitable zone. We find evidence\nfor planets in a large fraction of the parameter space where we are able to\ndetect them. This supports the idea that A stars harbor high-mass planets in\nwide orbits.\n", "  Optical spectroscopy study of the recent AG Peg outburst observed during the\nsecond half of 2015 is presented. Considerable variations of the intensity and\nthe shape of the spectral features as well as the changes of the hot component\nparameters, caused by the outburst, are discussed and certain similarities\nbetween the outburst of AG Peg and the outburst of a classical symbiotic stars\nare shown. It seems that after the end of the symbiotic nova phase, AG Peg\nbecame a member of the classical symbiotic stars group.\n", "  We have used the tidal equations of Zahn to determine the maximum orbital\ndistance at which companions are brought into Roche lobe contact with their\ngiant primary, when the primary expands during the giant phases. This is a key\nstep when determining the rates of interaction between giants and their\ncompanions. Our stellar structure calculations are presented as maximum radii\nreached during the red and asymptotic giant branch (RGB and AGB, respectively)\nstages of evolution for masses between 0.8 and 4.0 Mo (Z=0.001 - 0.04) and\ncompared with other models to gauge the uncertainty on radii deriving from\ndetails of these calculations. We find overall tidal capture distances that are\ntypically 1-4 times the maximum radial extent of the giant star, where\ncompanions are in the mass range from 1 Jupiter mass to a mass slightly smaller\nthan the mass of the primary. We find that only companions at initial orbital\nseparations between ~320 and ~630 Ro will be typically captured into a Roche\nlobe-filling interaction or a common envelope on the AGB. Comparing these\nlimits with the period distribution for binaries that will make PN, we deduce\nthat in the standard scenario where all ~1-8 Mo stars make a PN, at most 2.5\nper cent of all PN should have a post-common envelope central star binary, at\nodds with the observational lower limit of 15-20 per cent. The observed\nover-abundance of post-interaction central stars of PN cannot be easily\nexplained considering the uncertainties. We examine a range of explanations for\nthis discrepancy.\n", "  The age-metallicity relation (AMR) is a fundamental observational constraint\nfor understanding how the Galactic disc formed and evolved chemically in time.\nHowever, there is not yet an agreement on the observational properties of the\nAMR for the solar neighbourhood, primarily due to the difficulty in obtaining\naccurate stellar ages for individual field stars. We have started an\nobservational campaign for providing the much needed observational input by\nusing wide white dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binaries. White dwarfs are natural\nclocks and can be used to derive accurate ages. Metallicities can be obtained\nfrom the main sequence companions. Since the progenitors of white dwarfs and\nthe main sequence stars were born at the same time, WDMS binaries provide a\nunique opportunity to observationally constrain in a robust way the properties\nof the AMR. In this work we present the AMR derived from analysing a pilot\nsample of 23 WDMS binaries and provide clear observational evidence for the\nlack of correlation between age and metallicity at young and intermediate ages\n(0-7 Gyrs).\n", "  Condensible substances are nearly ubiquitous in planetary atmospheres. For\nthe most familiar case-water vapor in Earth's present climate-the condensible\ngas is dilute, in the sense that its concentration is everywhere small relative\nto the noncondensible background gases. A wide variety of important planetary\nclimate problems involve nondilute condensible substances. These include\nplanets near or undergoing a water vapor runaway and planets near the outer\nedge of the conventional habitable zone, for which CO2 is the condensible.\nStandard representations of convection in climate models rely on several\napproximations appropriate only to the dilute limit, while nondilute convection\ndiffers in fundamental ways from dilute convection. In this paper, a simple\nparameterization of convection valid in the nondilute as well as dilute limits\nis derived and used to discuss the basic character of nondilute convection. The\nenergy conservation properties of the scheme are discussed in detail and are\nverified in radiative-convective simulations. As a further illustration of the\nbehavior of the scheme, results for a runaway greenhouse atmosphere for both\nsteady instellation and seasonally varying instellation corresponding to a\nhighly eccentric orbit are presented. The latter case illustrates that the high\nthermal inertia associated with latent heat in nondilute atmospheres can damp\nout the effects of even extreme seasonal forcing.\n", "  We report a detailed investigation of magnetization, magnetocaloric effect\nand exchange bias studies on a mixed metal oxide YFe0.5Cr0.5O3 belonging to\nperovskite family. Our results reveal that the compound is in canted magnetic\nstate (CMS) where ferromagnetic correlations are present in an\nantiferromagnetic state. Magnetic entropy change of this compound follows a\npower law (deltaS_M ~ H^m) dependence of magnetic field. In this compound,\ninverse magnetocaloric effect (IMCE) is observed below 260 K while conventional\nmagnetocaloric effect (CMCE) above it. The exponent m is found to be\nindependent of temperature and field only in the IMCE region. Investigation of\ntemperature and magnetic field dependence studies of exchange bias, reveal a\ncompetition between effective Zeeman energy of the ferromagnetic regions and\nanisotropic exchange energy at the interface between ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic regions. Variation of exchange bias due to temperature and\nfield cycling is also investigated.\n", "  This paper reports on the installation and observations of a new solar\ntelescope installed on 7th October, 2014 at the Kodaikanal Observatory. The\ntelescope is a refractive type equipped with a tunable Lyot H$_{\\alpha}$\nfilter. A CCD camera of 2k$\\times$2k size makes the image of the Sun with a\npixel size of 1.21$^{\\prime\\prime}$ pixel$^{-1}$ with a full field-of-view of\n41$^{\\prime}$. The telescope is equipped with a guiding system which keeps the\nimage of the Sun within a few pixels throughout the observations. The FWHM of\nthe Lyot filter is 0.4\\AA~and the filter is motorized, capable of scanning the\nH$_{\\alpha}$ line profile at a smaller step size of 0.01\\AA. Partial-disk\nimaging covering about 10$^{\\prime}$, is also possible with the help of a relay\nlens kept in front of the CCD camera. In this paper, we report the detailed\nspecifications of the telescope, filter unit, its installation, observations\nand the procedures we have followed to calibrate and align the data. We also\npresent preliminary results with this new full-disk telescope.\n", "  The propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a medium with a screw\ndislocation is studied. Adopting the formalism of differential forms, it is\nshown that torsion is responsible for quantized modes. Moreover, it is\ndemonstrated that the modes thus obtained have well defined orbital angular\nmomentum, opening the possibility to design liquid-crystal-based optical\ntweezers.\n", "  We search for a dependence of the lifetime of $^{20}\\text{Na}$ nuclei on the\nnuclear spin direction. Such a directional dependence would be evidence for\nLorentz-invariance violation in weak interactions. A difference in lifetime\nbetween nuclei that are polarized in the east and west direction is searched\nfor. This difference is maximally sensitive to the rotation of the Earth, while\nthe sidereal dependence is free from most systematic errors. The experiment\nsets a limit of $2\\times 10^{-4}$ at 90 % C.L. on the amplitude of the sidereal\nvariation of the relative lifetime differences, an improvement by a factor 15\ncompared to an earlier result.\n", "  We study the effect of a hot and dense medium on the binding energy of\nhadronic molecules with open-charm mesons. We focus on a recent chiral\nquark-model-based prediction of a molecular state in the $N \\bar D$ system. We\nanalyze how the two-body thresholds and the hadron-hadron interactions are\nmodified when quark and meson masses and quark-meson couplings change in a\nfunction of the temperature and baryon density according to predictions of the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We find that in some cases the molecular binding is\nenhanced in medium as compared to their free-space binding. We discuss the\nconsequences of our findings for the search for exotic hadrons in high-energy\nheavy-ion collisions as well as in the forthcoming facilities FAIR or J-PARC.\n", "  Sausage modes that are axisymmetric fast magnetoacoustic oscillations of\nsolar coronal loops are characterized by variation of the plasma density and\nmagnetic field, and hence cause time variations of the electron plasma\nfrequency and cyclotron frequency. The latter parameters determine the\ncondition for the double plasma resonance (DPR), which is responsible for the\nappearance of zebra-pattern (ZP) structures in time spectra of solar type IV\nradio bursts. We perform numerical simulations of standing and propagating\nsausage oscillations in a coronal loop modeled as a straight, field-aligned\nplasma slab, and determine the time variation of the DPR layer locations.\nInstant values of the plasma density and magnetic field at the DPR layers\nallowed us to construct skeletons of the time variation of ZP stripes in radio\nspectra. In the presence of a sausage oscillation, the ZP structures are shown\nto have characteristic wiggles with the time period prescribed by the sausage\noscillation. Standing and propagating sausage oscillations are found to have\ndifferent signatures in ZP patterns. We conclude that ZP wiggles can be used\nfor the detection of short-period sausage oscillations and the exploitation of\ntheir seismological potential.\n", "  Crystallography provides an inventory of the electron-like particles that\nemerge in a lattice world. Perspective for Science on arXiv:1603.03093\n", "  This paper aims at imaging the dynamics of metabolic activity of cells. Using\ndynamic optical coherence tomography, we introduce a new multi-particle\ndynamical model to simulate the movements of the collagen and the cell\nmetabolic activity and develop an efficient signal separation technique for\nsub-cellular imaging. We perform a singular-value decomposition of the dynamic\noptical images to isolate the intensity of the metabolic activity. We prove\nthat the largest eigenvalue of the associated Casorati matrix corresponds to\nthe collagen. We present several numerical simulations to illustrate and\nvalidate our approach.\n", "  Attempts at cloning a quantum system result in the introduction of\nimperfections in the state of the copies. This is a consequence of the\nno-cloning theorem, which is a fundamental law of quantum physics and the\nbackbone of security for quantum communications. Although such perfect copies\nare prohibited, a quantum state may be copied with maximal accuracy via various\noptimal cloning schemes. Optimal quantum cloning, which lies at the border of\nthe physical limit imposed by the no-signalling theorem and the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle, has been experimentally realized for low dimensional\nphotonic states. However, an increase in the dimensionality of quantum systems\nis greatly beneficial to quantum computation and communication protocols.\nNonetheless, no experimental demonstration of optimal cloning machines has\nhitherto been shown for high-dimensional quantum systems. Here, we perform\noptimal cloning of high-dimensional photonic states by means of the\nsymmetrization method. We show the universality of our technique by conducting\ncloning of numerous arbitrary input states, and fully characterize our cloning\nmachine by performing quantum state tomography on \\emph{cloned} photons. In\naddition, a cloning attack on a Bennett and Brassard (BB84) quantum key\ndistribution protocol is experimentally demonstrated in order to reveal the\nrobustness of high-dimensional states in quantum cryptography.\n", "  We study the atom-field interaction when the field is in a mixture of\ncoherent states. We show that in this case it is possible to calculate\nanalytically the field entropy for times of the order of twice the collapse\ntime. Such analytical results are done with the help of numerical analysis.\n", "  A nonlinearly coupled system of bouncing balls is shown to exhibit features\nlike self-organised-criticality (SOC) and punctuated equilibrium (PE) in\nsuitable parameter domains. The temporal evolution of the non-stationary\namplitudes is analysed through local methods to unravel the transient periodic\ncomponents and fluctuations giving rise to SOC and PE type behaviours. This\nsimple dynamical system follows Gutenberg-Richter relation and also manifests\nthe Devil's staircase, explicating the universality of these features in\ndiverse complex systems.\n", "  In all archetypical reported (001)-oriented perovskite heterostructures, it\nhas been deduced that the preferential occupation of two-dimensional electron\ngases is in-plane $d_\\textrm{xy}$ state. In sharp contrast to this, the\ninvestigated electronic structure of a spinel-perovskite heterostructure\n$\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ by resonant soft X-ray linear dichroism,\ndemonstrates that the preferential occupation is out-of-plane\n$d_\\textrm{xz}$/$d_\\textrm{yz}$ states for interfacial electrons. Moreover, the\nimpact of strain further corroborates that this anomalous orbital structure can\nbe linked to the altered crystal field at the interface and symmetry breaking\nof the interfacial structural units. Our findings provide another interesting\nroute to engineer emergent quantum states with deterministic orbital symmetry.\n", "  The aim of this research is to simulate the interaction of the solar wind\nwith the magnetic field of Mercury and to study the particle fluxes between the\nmagnetosheath and the planet surface. We simulate the magnetosphere structure\nusing the open source MHD code PLUTO in spherical geometry with a multipolar\nexpansion of the Hermean magnetic field (Anderson, B. J. et al, 2012). We\nperform two simulations with realistic solar wind parameters to study the\nproperties of a plasma stream originated in the reconnection region between the\ninterplanetary and the Hermean magnetic field. The plasma precipitates along\nthe open magnetic field lines to the planet surface showing a fast expansion,\nrarefaction and cooling. The plasma stream is correlated with a flattening of\nthe magnetic field observed by MESSENGER due to the adjacency of the\nreconnection region where the solar wind is injected to the inner\nmagnetosphere.\n", "  The transport of sediments by a fluid flow is commonly found in nature and in\nindustry. In nature, it is found in rivers, oceans, deserts, and other\nenvironments. In industry, it is found in petroleum pipelines conveying grains,\nin sewer systems, and in dredging lines, for example. This study investigates\nexperimentally the transport of the grains of a granular bed sheared by a\nturbulent liquid flow. In our experiments, fully developed turbulent water\nflows were imposed over a flat granular bed of known granulometry. Under the\ntested conditions, the grains were transported as bed load, i.e., they became\nentrained by rolling and sliding over each other, forming a moving granular\nlayer. The present experiments were performed close to incipient bed load, a\ncase for which experimental data on grains velocities are scarce. Distinct from\nprevious experiments, an entrance length assured that the water stream over the\nloose bed was fully developed. At different water flow rates, the moving layer\nwas filmed using a high-speed camera, and the grains' displacements and\nvelocities were determined by post-processing the images with a numerical code\ndeveloped in the course of this study. The bed-load transport rate was\nestimated and correlated to the water flow conditions.\n", "  Recent studies have found a positive correlation between the star-formation\nrate of galaxies and their gamma-ray luminosity. Galaxies with a high\nstar-formation rate are expected to produce a large amount of high-energy\ncosmic rays, which emit gamma-rays when interacting with the interstellar\nmedium and radiation fields. We search for gamma-ray emission from a sample of\ngalaxies within and beyond the Local Group with data from the LAT instrument\nonboard the Fermi satellite. We exclude recently detected galaxies (NGC 253,\nM82, NGC 4945, NGC 1068, NGC 2146, Arp 220) and use seven years of cumulative\nPass 8 data from the LAT in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range. No new detections are\nseen in the data and upper limits for the gamma- ray fluxes are calculated. The\ncorrelation between gamma-ray luminosity and infrared luminosity for galaxies\nobtained using our new upper limits is in agreement with a previously published\ncorrelation, but the new upper limits imply that some galaxies are not as\nefficient gamma-ray emitters as previously thought.\n", "  The aim of this study is to simulate the slow mode structures in the Hermean\nmagnetosphere. We use a single fluid MHD model and a multipolar expansion of\nthe Northward displaced Hermean magnetic field, to perform simulations with\ndifferent solar wind parameter to foreseen the most favorable configuration for\nthe formation of slow modes, attending to the solar wind density, velocity,\ntemperature and the interplanetary magnetic field orientation. If the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is aligned with the Mercury-Sun direction, the\nmagnetic axis of Mercury in the Northward direction or the planet orbital\nplane, slow mode structures are observed nearby the South pole. If the\norientation is in the Sun-Mercury or Northward directions, slow mode structures\nare observed nearby the North pole, but smaller compared with the structures\nnear the South pole. Increase the density or the solar wind velocity avoids the\nformation of slow modes structures, not observed for a dynamic pressure larger\nthan $6.25 \\cdot 10^{-9}$ Pa in the case of a Northward interplanetary magnetic\nfield orientation, due to the enhancement of the bow shock compression. If the\nsolar wind temperature increases, the slow mode structures are wider because\nthe sonic Mach number is smaller and the bow shock is less compressed.\n", "  Photonic integrated circuits are established as the technique of choice for a\nnumber of astronomical processing functions due to their compactness, high\nlevel of integration, low losses, and stability. Temperature control,\nmechanical vibration and acoustic noise become controllable for such a device\nenabling much more complex processing than can realistically be considered with\nbulk optics. To date the benefits have mainly been at wavelengths around 1550\nnm but in the important Mid-Infrared region, standard photonic chips absorb\nlight strongly. Chalcogenide glasses are well known for their transparency to\nbeyond 10000 nm, and the first results from coupler devices intended for use in\nan interferometric nuller for exoplanetary observation in the Mid-Infrared L\nband (3800-4200 nm) are presented here showing that suitable performance can be\nobtained both theoretically and experimentally for the first fabricated devices\noperating at 4000 nm.\n", "  Multi-object spectroscopy has been a key technique contributing to the\ncurrent era of 'precision cosmology'. From the first exploratory surveys of the\nlarge-scale structure and evolution of the universe to the current generation\nof superbly detailed maps spanning a wide range of redshifts, multi-object\nspectroscopy has been a fundamentally important tool for mapping the rich\nstructure of the cosmic web and extracting cosmological information of\nincreasing variety and precision. This will continue to be true for the\nforeseeable future, as we seek to map the evolving geometry and structure of\nthe universe over the full extent of cosmic history in order to obtain the most\nprecise and comprehensive measurements of cosmological parameters. Here I\nbriefly summarize the contributions that multi-object spectroscopy has made to\ncosmology so far, then review the major surveys and instruments currently in\nplay and their prospects for pushing back the cosmological frontier. Finally, I\nexamine some of the next generation of instruments and surveys to explore how\nthe field will develop in coming years, with a particular focus on specialised\nmulti-object spectrographs for cosmology and the capabilities of multi-object\nspectrographs on the new generation of extremely large telescopes.\n", "  The use of an asymmetric broadening in the transport distribution, a\ncharacteristic of resonant structures, is proposed as a route to engineer a\ndecrease in electronic thermal conductivity thereby enhancing the electronic\nfigure of merit in nanostructured thermoelectrics. Using toy models, we first\ndemonstrate that a decrease in thermal conductivity resulting from such an\nasymmetric broadening may indeed lead to an electronic figure of merit well in\nexcess of 1000 in an idealized situation and in excess of 10 in a realistic\nsituation. We then substantiate with realistic resonant structures designed\nusing graphene nano-ribbons by employing a tight binding framework with edge\ncorrection that match density functional theory calculations under the local\ndensity approximation. The calculated figure of merit exceeding 10 in such\nrealistic structures further reinforces the concept and sets a promising\ndirection to use nano-ribbon structures to engineer a favorable decrease in the\nelectronic thermal conductivity.\n", "  The matrix element of the weak transition {\\Lambda}_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda}_c\ncan be expressed in terms of six form factors. {\\Lambda}_Q(Q = b;c) can be\nregarded as composed of a heavy quark Q(Q = b;c) and a diquark which is made up\nof the remaining two light quarks. In this picture, we express these six form\nfactors in terms of Bethe-Salpeter wave functions to second order in the 1/m_Q\nexpansion. With the kernel containing both the scalar confinement and the\none-gluon-exchange terms we calculate the form factors and the decay widths of\nthe semileptonic decay {\\Lambda}_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda}_clv as well as\nnonleptonic decays {\\Lambda}_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda}_cP(V) numerically. We also\nadd QCD corrections since they are comparable with 1/m_Q corrections.\n", "  We comment on a recent paper published by McWilliams et al claiming that\nhigh-pressure/high-temperature hydrogen is a semi-conductor or semi-metal, in\nconflict with all earlier measurements on this system which show that it is\nmetallic. We point out problems and inconsistencies and propose an alternate\ninterpretation such that their results can be compatible with the observation\nof metallic hydrogen.\n", "  Polycrystalline CuO samples with Co doping were prepared by solid state\nmethod with flowing oxygen condition and examined their structural and\nmultiferroic properties. Structural studies have confirmed single phase\nmonoclinic crystal structure of all samples, however, in Co doped samples a\ndecrease in volume with an increase in monoclinic distortion is found. For\npristine sample, temperature dependent magnetization has confirmed two\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at 213 K and 230 K and frequency\nindependent dielectric peaks at these AFM transitions suggesting the\nferroelectric nature. Magnetization of the Co doped samples has showed a\nmarginal increase in ordering temperature of the high-temperature AFM\ntransition and decrease in low temperature AFM ordering temperature. Further,\ndoped samples have shown giant dielectric constant with no signature of\nferroelectricity. The x-ray photoelectric spectroscopy study has revealed\nmultiple valance states for both Co and Cu in the doped samples that\nsimultaneously explain the giant dielectric constant and suppression of\nferroelectric order.\n", "  We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that\ndescribes an age-structured population living in changing environment on $N$\npatches. We prove existence and uniqueness of solution and analyze large time\nbehavior of the system in time-independent case, for periodically changing and\nfor irregularly varying environment. Under the assumption that every patch can\nbe reached from every other patch, directly or through several intermediary\npatches, and that net reproductive operator has spectral radius larger than\none, we prove that population is persistent on all patches. If the spectral\nradius is less or equal one, extinction on all patches is imminent.\n", "  We analyze the electronic structure of lithium ionic conductors, ${\\rm\nLi_3PO_4}$ and ${\\rm Li_3PS_4}$, using the electronic stress tensor density and\nkinetic energy density with special focus on the ionic bonds among them. We\nfind that, as long as we examine the pattern of the eigenvalues of the\nelectronic stress tensor density, we cannot distinguish between the ionic bonds\nand bonds among metalloid atoms. We then show that they can be distinguished by\nlooking at the morphology of the electronic interface, the zero surface of the\nelectronic kinetic energy density.\n", "  We review recent results obtained using the data recorded with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e- collider in KEK, Japan.\n", "  While optical and radio transient surveys have enjoyed a renaissance over the\npast decade, the dynamic infrared sky remains virtually unexplored. The\ninfrared is a powerful tool for probing transient events in dusty regions that\nhave high optical extinction, and for detecting the coolest of stars that are\nbright only at these wavelengths. The fundamental roadblocks in studying the\ninfrared time-domain have been the overwhelmingly bright sky background (250\ntimes brighter than optical) and the narrow field-of-view of infrared cameras\n(largest is 0.6 sq deg). To begin to address these challenges and open a new\nobservational window in the infrared, we present Palomar Gattini-IR: a 25 sq\ndegree, 300mm aperture, infrared telescope at Palomar Observatory that surveys\nthe entire accessible sky (20,000 sq deg) to a depth of 16.4 AB mag (J band,\n1.25um) every night. Palomar Gattini-IR is wider in area than every existing\ninfrared camera by more than a factor of 40 and is able to survey large areas\nof sky multiple times. We anticipate the potential for otherwise infeasible\ndiscoveries, including, for example, the elusive electromagnetic counterparts\nto gravitational wave detections. With dedicated hardware in hand, and a F/1.44\ntelescope available commercially and cost-effectively, Palomar Gattini-IR will\nbe on-sky in early 2017 and will survey the entire accessible sky every night\nfor two years. Palomar Gattini-IR will pave the way for a dual hemisphere,\ninfrared-optimized, ultra-wide field high cadence machine called Turbo\nGattini-IR. To take advantage of the low sky background at 2.5 um, two\nidentical systems will be located at the polar sites of the South Pole,\nAntarctica and near Eureka on Ellesmere Island, Canada. Turbo Gattini-IR will\nsurvey 15,000 sq. degrees to a depth of 20AB, the same depth of the VISTA VHS\nsurvey, every 2 hours with a survey efficiency of 97%.\n", "  Graphite surfaces can be manipulated by several methods to create graphene\nstructures of different shapes and sizes. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\ncan be used to create these structures either through mechanical contact\nbetween the tip and the surface or through electro-exfoliation. In the latter,\nthe mechanisms involved in the process of exfoliation with an applied voltage\nare not fully understood. Here we show how a graphite surface can be locally\nexfoliated in a systematic manner by applying an electrostatic force with a STM\ntip at the edge of a terrace, forming triangular flakes several nanometers in\nlength. We demonstrate, through experiments and simulations, how these flakes\nare created by a two-step process: first a voltage ramp must be applied at the\nedge of the terrace, and then the tip must be scanned perpendicularly to the\nedge. Ab-initio electrostatic calculations reveal that the presence of charges\non the graphite surface weakens the interaction between layers allowing for\nexfoliation at voltages in the same range as those used experimentally.\nMolecular dynamics simulations show that a force applied locally on the edge of\na step produces triangular flakes such as those observed under STM. Our results\nprovide new insights towards surface modification that can be extended to other\nlayered materials.\n", "  The dynamics of finite dimension open quantum systems is studied with the\nhelp of the simplest possible form of projection operators, namely the ones\nwhich project only onto one dimensional subspaces. The simplicity of the action\nof the projection operators always leads to an analytical solution of the\ndynamical master equation, even in the non-Markovian case, in any perturbative\norder. The analytical solution correctly reproduces the short-time dynamics,\nand can be used to recursively recover the dynamics for an arbitrary time\ninterval with arbitrary precision. The necessary number of relevant degrees of\nfreedom to completely characterise an open quantum system is $(n-1)(n+2)/2,$\nwhere $n$ is the dimension of the Hilbert space of the open system. The method\nis illustrated by two examples, the relaxation of a qubit in a thermal bath and\nthe dynamics of two interacting qubits in a common environment.\n", "  In this paper, as a first step in examining the properties of a feasible\nportfolio subset that is characterized by budget and risk constraints, we\nassess the maximum and minimum of the investment concentration using replica\nanalysis. To do this, we apply an analytical approach of statistical mechanics.\nWe note that the optimization problem considered in this paper is the dual\nproblem of the portfolio optimization problem discussed in the literature, and\nwe verify that these optimal solutions are also dual. We also present numerical\nexperiments, in which we use the method of steepest descent that is based on\nLagrange's method of undetermined multipliers, and we compare the numerical\nresults to those obtained by replica analysis in order to assess the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach.\n", "  We demonstrate a narrow band phase sensitive amplifier in the pump degenerate\nconfiguration which employs ps pump pulses. Control of the amplifier bandwidth\nis achieved via changes of the pump spectral width. A phase sensitive gain\nbetween -6 and 6 decibels, with an overall system gain of 28dB was\ndemonstrated.\n", "  The VIALACTEA project has a work package dedicated to Tools and\nInfrastructure and, inside it, a task for the Database and Virtual Observatory\nInfrastructure. This task aims at providing an infrastructure to store all the\nresources needed by the, more purposely, scientific work packages of the\nproject itself. This infrastructure includes a combination of: storage\nfacilities, relational databases and web services on top of them, and has\ntaken, as a whole, the name of VIALACTEA Knowledge Base (VLKB). This\ncontribution illustrates the current status of this VLKB. It details the set of\ndata resources put together; describes the database that allows data discovery\nthrough VO inspired metadata maintenance; illustrates the discovery, cutout and\naccess services built on top of the former two for the users to exploit the\ndata content.\n", "  Interplanetary (IP) shock plays a key role in causing the global dynamic\nchanges of the geospace environment. For the perspective of Solar-Terrestrial\nrelationship, it will be of great importance to estimate the properties of\npost-shock solar wind simply and accurately. Motivated by this, we performed a\nstatistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the\nsignificantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH\nand AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with\nnorthward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the\nsudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is\nrelative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks\nwith southward IMF (92 cases), the SYMH index suddenly decreases at a certain\nrate after SI, and the change of AL index is much significant, of -316 nT.\nFurthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly\ncorrelated with the post-shock reconnection E-field (E$_{KL}$). Based on these\nfacts, an inversion model of post-shock IMF orientation and E$_{KL}$ is\ndeveloped. The model validity is also confirmed by studying 68 IP shocks in the\nperiod of 2009-2013. The inversion accuracy of IMF orientation is 88.24%, and\nthe inversion efficiency of E$_{KL}$ is as high as 78%.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to derive spectral estimates on the eigenvalue\nmoments of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian defined on the two-dimensional disk\nwith a radially symmetric magnetic field.\n", "  Two dynamical systems with same symmetry should have features in common, and\nas far as their shared symmetry is concerned, one may represent the other. The\nthree light quark constituents of the hadrons, a) have an approximate flavor\nSU(3) symmetry, b) have an exact color SU(3) symmetry, and c) as spin 1/2\nparticles, have a Lorentz SO(3,1) symmetry. So does a 3D harmonic oscillator.\na) Its Hamiltonian has the SU(3) symmetry, breakable if the 3 fundamental modes\nof oscillation are not identical. b) The 3 directions of oscillation have the\npermutation symmetry. This enables one to create three copies of unbreakable\nSU(3) symmetry for each mode of the oscillation, and mimic the color of the\nelementary particles. And c) The Lagrangian of the 3D oscillator has the\nSO(3,1) symmetry. This can be employed to accommodate the spin of the\nparticles. In this paper we draw up a one-to-one correspondence between the\neigen modes of the Poisson bracket operator of the 3D oscillator and the flavor\nmultiplets of the particles, and between the permuted modes of the oscillator\nand the color and anticolor multiplets of the particles. Gluons are represented\nby the generators of the color SU(3) symmetry of the oscillator. Harmonic\noscillators are common place objects and, wherever encountered, are\nanalytically solvable. Elementary particles, on the other hand, are abstract\nentities far from one's reach. Understanding of one may help a better\nappreciation of the other.\n", "  Unitary error bases have a great number of applications across quantum\ninformation and quantum computation, and are fundamentally linked to quantum\nteleportation, dense coding and quantum error correction. Werner's\ncombinatorial construction builds a unitary error basis from a family of\nHadamard matrices and a Latin square. In this dissertation, I give a new\ncategorical axiomatisation of Latin squares, and use this to give a fully\ngraphical presentation and proof of the correctness of Werner's construction.\nThe categorical approach makes clear that some of the Latin square axioms are\nunnecessary for the construction to go through, and I propose a generalised\nconstruction scheme with the potential to create new classes of unitary error\nbases.\n", "  We present a description of a new instrument development, HARPS3, planned to\nbe installed on an upgraded and roboticized Isaac Newton Telescope by end-2018.\nHARPS3 will be a high resolution (R = 115,000) echelle spectrograph with a\nwavelength range from 380-690 nm. It is being built as part of the Terra\nHunting Experiment - a future 10 year radial velocity measurement programme to\ndiscover Earth-like exoplanets. The instrument design is based on the\nsuccessful HARPS spectrograph on the 3.6m ESO telescope and HARPS-N on the TNG\ntelescope. The main changes to the design in HARPS3 will be: a customised fibre\nadapter at the Cassegrain focus providing a stabilised beam feed and on-sky\nfibre diameter ~ 1.4 arcsec, the implementation of a new continuous flow\ncryostat to keep the CCD temperature very stable, detailed characterisation of\nthe HARPS3 CCD to map the effective pixel positions and thus provide an\nimproved accuracy wavelength solution, an optimised integrated polarimeter and\nthe instrument integrated into a robotic operation. The robotic operation will\noptimise our programme which requires our target stars to be measured on a\nnightly basis. We present an overview of the entire project, including a\ndescription of our anticipated robotic operation.\n", "  The thermodynamic bag model (tdBag) has been applied widely to model quark\nmatter properties in both heavy-ion and astrophysics communities. Several\nfundamental physics aspects are missing in tdBag, e.g., dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking (D$\\chi$SB) and repulsions due to the vector interaction are\nboth included explicitly in the novel vBag quark matter model of Kl\\\"ahn and\nFischer (2015) (Astrophys. J. 810, 134 (2015)). An important feature of vBag is\nthe simultaneous D$\\chi$SB and deconfinement, where the latter links vBag to a\ngiven hadronic model for the construction of the phase transition. In this\narticle we discuss the extension to finite temperatures and the resulting phase\ndiagram for the isospin symmetric medium.\n", "  Based on the experimental observation that there is a coexisting region\nbetween the antiferromagnetic (AF) and $\\textit{d}$-wave superconducting\n($\\textit{d}$SC) phases, the influences of gauge boson mass $m_{a}$ on chiral\nsymmetry restoration and deconfinement phase transitions in QED$_{3}$ are\ninvestigated simultaneously within a unified framework, i.e., Dyson-Schwinger\nequations. The results show that the chiral symmetry restoration phase\ntransition in the presence of the gauge boson mass $m_{a}$ is a typical\nsecond-order phase transition; the chiral symmetry restoration and\ndeconfinement phase transitions are coincident; the critical number of fermion\nflavors $N^{c}_{f}$ decreases as the gauge boson mass $m_{a}$ increases and\nthere exists a boundary that separates the $N^{c}_{f}$-$m_{a}$ plane into\nchiral symmetry breaking/confinement region for ($N_{f}^{c}$, $m_{a}$) below\nthe boundary and chiral symmetry restoration/deconfinement region for\n($N_{f}^{c}$, $m_{a}$) above it.\n", "  Rim and back geometry determine much of the behavior of sound inside the pot,\nwhose effect on total, produced sound is subtle but discernible. The theory of\nsound inside a cylinder is reviewed and demonstrated. And previous work on the\nHelmholtz resonance and the interplay between the Helmholtz resonance and the\nlowest head mode is revisited using some improved techniques.\n", "  We propose wave and ray approaches for modelling mid- and high- frequency\nstructural vibrations through smoothed joints on thin shell cylindrical ridges.\nThe models both emerge from a simplified classical shell theory setting. The\nray model is analysed via an appropriate phase-plane analysis, from which the\nfixed points can be interpreted in terms of the reflection and transmission\nproperties. The corresponding full wave scattering model is studied using the\nfinite difference method to investigate the scattering properties of an\nincident plane wave. Through both models we uncover the scattering properties\nof smoothed joints in the interesting mid-frequency region close to the ring\nfrequency, where there is a qualitative change in the dynamics from anisotropic\nto simple geodesic propagation.\n", "  Measurements performed with the purpose of characterizing the charged\nsecondary radiation for dose release monitoring in particle therapy are\nreported. Charged secondary yields, energy spectra and emission profiles\nproduced in poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) target by 4He and 12C beams of\ndifferent therapeutic energies were measured at 60 and 90 degree with respect\nto the primary beam direction. The secondary yields of protons produced along\nthe primary beam path in PMMA target were obtained. The energy spectra of\ncharged secondaries were obtained from time-of-flight information, whereas the\nemission profiles were reconstructed exploiting tracking detector information.\nThe measured charged secondary yields and emission profiles are in agreement\nwith the results reported in literature and confirm the feasibility of ion beam\ntherapy range monitoring using 12C ion beam. The feasibility of range\nmonitoring using charged secondary particles is also suggested for 4He ion\nbeam.\n", "  Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we\ndiscuss the full set of proper BRST and anti-BRST transformations for a\ndiffeomorphism invariant theory which is described by the Lagrangian density of\na standard bosonic string (proposed by Kato and Ogawa). The above (anti-)BRST\nsymmetry transformations are off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting.\nThe latter property is valid on a constrained hypersurface in the two\ndimensional spacetime manifold (traced out by the propagation of the bosonic\nstring) where the Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restriction is satisfied. This\nCF-type restriction is found to be an (anti-)BRST invariant quantity. We derive\nthe precise form of the BRST and anti-BRST invariant Lagrangian densities as\nwell as the exact expressions for the conserved (anti-)BRST and ghost charges\nof our present theory. The derivation of the proper anti-BRST symmetry\ntransformations and the emergence of the CF-type restriction are completely\nnovel results in our present investigation.\n", "  Movement coordination in human ensembles has been studied little in the\ncurrent literature. In the existing experimental works, situations where all\nsubjects are connected with each other through direct visual and auditory\ncoupling, and social interaction affects their coordination, have been\ninvestigated. Here, we study coordination in human ensembles via a novel\ncomputer-based set-up that enables individuals to coordinate each other's\nmotion from a distance so as to minimize the influence of social interaction.\nThe proposed platform makes it possible to implement different visual\ninteraction patterns among the players, so that participants take into\nconsideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the\nevaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of\ninterconnections among the players and their own dynamics. Our set-up enables\nalso the deployment of virtual players to investigate dyadic interaction\nbetween a human and a virtual agent, as well as group synchronization in mixed\nteams of human and virtual agents. We use this novel set-up to study\ncoordination both in dyads and in groups over different structures of\ninterconnections, with and without virtual agents. We find that, in dual\ninteraction, virtual players manage to interact with participants in a\nhuman-like fashion, thus confirming findings in previous work. We also observe\nthat, in group interaction, the level of coordination among humans in the\nabsence of direct visual and auditory coupling depends on the structure of\ninterconnections among participants. This confirms, as recently suggested in\nthe literature, that different coordination levels are achieved over diverse\nvisual pairings in the presence and in the absence of social interaction. We\npresent preliminary experimental results on the effect on group coordination of\ndeploying virtual computer agents in the human ensemble.\n", "  Homes' law, $\\rho_s = C \\sigma_{\\mathrm{DC}} T_c$, is an empirical law\nsatisfied by various superconductors with a material independent universal\nconstant $C$, where $\\rho_{s}$ is the superfluid density at zero temperature,\n$T_c$ is the critical temperature, and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{DC}}$ is the electric\nDC conductivity in the normal state close to $T_c$. We study Homes' law in\nholographic superconductor with Q-lattices and find that Homes' law is realized\nfor some parameter regime in insulating phase near the metal-insulator\ntransition boundary, where momentum relaxation is strong. In computing the\nsuperfluid density, we employ two methods: one is related to the infinite DC\nconductivity and the other is related to the magnetic penetration depth. With\nfinite momentum relaxation both yield the same results, while without momentum\nrelaxation only the latter gives the superfluid density correctly because the\nformer has a spurious contribution from the infinite DC conductivity due to\ntranslation invariance.\n", "  We analysed the optical spectra of HII regions extracted from a sample of 350\ngalaxies of the CALIFA survey. We calculated total O/H abundances and, for the\nfirst time, N/O ratios using the semi-empirical routine HII-CHI-mistry, which,\naccording to P\\'erez-Montero (2014), is consistent with the direct method and\nreduces the uncertainty in the O/H derivation using [NII] lines owing to the\ndispersion in the O/H-N/O relation. Then we performed linear fittings to the\nabundances as a function of the de-projected galactocentric distances. The\nanalysis of the radial distribution both for O/H and N/O in the non-interacting\ngalaxies reveals that both average slopes are negative, but a non-negligible\nfraction of objects have a flat or even a positive gradient (at least 10\\% for\nO/H and 4\\% for N/O). The slopes normalised to the effective radius appear to\nhave a slight dependence on the total stellar mass and the morphological type,\nas late low-mass objects tend to have flatter slopes. No clear relation is\nfound, however, to explain the presence of inverted gradients in this sample,\nand there is no dependence between the average slopes and the presence of a\nbar. The relation between the resulting O/H and N/O linear fittings at the\neffective radius is much tighter (correlation coefficient $\\rho_s$ = 0.80) than\nbetween O/H and N/O slopes ($\\rho_s$ = 0.39) or for O/H and N/O in the\nindividual \\hii\\ regions ($\\rho_s$ = 0.37). These O/H and N/O values at the\neffective radius also correlate very tightly (less than 0.03 dex of dispersion)\nwith total luminosity and stellar mass. The relation with other integrated\nproperties, such as star formation rate, colour, or morphology, can be\nunderstood only in light of the found relation with mass.\n", "  We propose a shallow water model which combines the dispersion relation of\nwater waves and the Boussinesq equations, and which extends the Whitham\nequation to permit bidirectional propagation. We establish that its\nsufficiently small, periodic wave train is spectrally unstable to long\nwavelength perturbations, provided that the wave number is greater than a\ncritical value, like the Benjamin-Feir instability of a Stokes wave. We verify\nthat the asso- ciated linear operator possesses infinitely many collisions of\npurely imaginary eigenvalues, but they do not contribute to instability away\nfrom the origin in the spectral plane to the leading order in the amplitude\nparameter. We discuss the effects of surface tension on the modulational\ninstability. The results agree with those from formal asymptotic expansions and\nnumerical computations for the physical problem.\n", "  Scientific software is often driven by multiple parameters that affect both\naccuracy and performance. Since finding the optimal configuration of these\nparameters is a highly complex task, it extremely common that the software is\nused suboptimally. In a typical scenario, accuracy requirements are imposed,\nand attained through suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present a\nmethodology for the automatic selection of parameters for simulation codes, and\na corresponding prototype tool. To be amenable to our methodology, the target\ncode must expose the parameters affecting accuracy and performance, and there\nmust be formulas available for error bounds and computational complexity of the\nunderlying methods. As a case study, we consider the particle-particle\nparticle-mesh method (PPPM) from the LAMMPS suite for molecular dynamics, and\nuse our tool to identify configurations of the input parameters that achieve a\ngiven accuracy in the shortest execution time. When compared with the\nconfigurations suggested by expert users, the parameters selected by our tool\nyield reductions in the time-to-solution ranging between 10% and 60%. In other\nwords, for the typical scenario where a fixed number of core-hours are granted\nand simulations of a fixed number of timesteps are to be run, usage of our tool\nmay allow up to twice as many simulations. While we develop our ideas using\nLAMMPS as computational framework and use the PPPM method for dispersion as\ncase study, the methodology is general and valid for a range of software tools\nand methods.\n", "  The differential Optical Transfer Function (dOTF) is a focal plane wavefront\nsensing method that uses a diversity in the pupil plane to generate two\ndifferent focal plane images. The difference of their Fourier transforms\nrecovers the complex amplitude of the pupil down to the spatial scale of the\ndiversity. We produce two simultaneous PSF images with diversity using a\npolarizing filter at the edge of the telescope pupil, and a polarization camera\nto simultaneously record the two images. Here we present the first on-sky\ndemonstration of polarization dOTF at the 1.0m South African Astronomical\nObservatory telescope in Sutherland, and our attempt to validate it with\nsimultaneous Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor images.\n", "  In this work we present a four component relativistic theoretical\ninvestigation of the trihalides of lutetium and lawrencium, LuX3, LrX3 (X= F,\nCl, Br, I) respectively using density functional theory (DFT) with different\ndensity functional and a geometrical optimisation procedure as implemented in\nDIRAC-package. The results show the trend of bonding from lighter to the\nheavier halide atoms and between 4f/5f atoms Lu and Lr.\n", "  A fascinating property of extremal Kerr black hole (BH) is that it could be\nact as a particle accelerator with infinite high center-of-mass (CM) energy\n\\cite{bsw}. In this note, we would like to discuss about such fascinating\nresult and to point out that this infinite energy at the event horizon comes\nsolely due \\emph{to the singular nature of the extremal limit}. We also show\nthat a non-extremal Kerr BH can \\emph{not} transform into extremal Kerr BH by\nthe Ba\\~{n}ados-Silk-West mechanism. Moreover, we discuss about three possible\ngeometries (near extremal, purely extremal and near horizon of extremal Kerr)\nof this mechanism. We further prove that near extremal geometry and near\nhorizon geometry, precisely extremal geometry of extremal Kerr BHs are\nqualitatively different. Near extremal geometry and near horizon geometry gives\nthe CM energy is finite, whereas precisely extremal geometry gives the\ndiverging energy. Thus, we can argue that extremal Kerr BH and non-extremal\nKerr BH are quite distinct objects. Finally, we show that the CM energy of\ncollisions of particles not only diverges at infinite red-shift surface\n($r_{+}$) but it could also diverges at the ISCO ($r_{isco}$) or at the\ncircular photon orbit ($r_{cpo}$) or at the marginally bound circular orbit\n($r_{mbco}$) or at the Cauchy horizon i.e. at $r \\equiv\nr_{isco}=r_{cpo}=r_{mbco}=r_{+}=r_{-}=M$.\n", "  We present a compilation of radio, infrared, optical and hard X-ray (2-10kev)\ndata for a sample of 90 Seyfert 2 galaxies(Sy2s) with spectropolarimetric\nobservations (41 Sy2s with detection of polarized broad lines (PBL) and 49\nwithout PBL). Compared to Sy2s without PBL, Sy2s with PBL tend to be\nearlier-type spirals, and show warmer mid-infrared color and significant excess\nof emissions (including the hard X-ray(2-10kev), [O {\\sc iii}]$\\lambda$5007,\ninfrared (25 $\\mu$m) and radio). Our analyses indicate that the majority of\nSy2s without PBL are those sources having less powerful AGN activities, most\nlikely caused by low accretion rate. It implies that the detectability of the\npolarized broad emission lines in Sy2s may depend on their central AGN\nactivities in most cases. Based on the available data, we find no compelling\nevidence for the presence of two types of Sy2s, one type of them has been\nproposed to be intrinsically different from Sy2s claimed in Unification Model.\n", "  Powerful extended radio galaxies in the 3CR survey are observed out to\nredshifts of about 2. For redshifts greater than about 0.3, the average\nlobe-lobe size of the sources decreases monotonically with redshift for all\nreasonable cosmological parameter choices. This suggests that the\ncharacteristic time for which an AGN produces a highly collimated outflow that\npowers the radio emission is shorter for the high-redshift sources than it is\nfor low-redshift sources. The fact that the characteristic time for which an\nAGN produces a collimated outflow decreases with redshift implies that the\nphysical mechanism that gives rise to the large scale jets is not Eddington\nlimited. Higher redshift sources have higher radio powers due the flux limit of\nthe sample, and sources with higher radio powers have higher beam powers\nrelative to lower redshift sources. Both the beam power and active lifetime of\nthe AGN are controlled by processes occurring at the heart of the AGN, and may\nbe related for non-Eddington limited processes. The relation between the active\nlifetime, $t_*$, and the beam power, $L_j$, of powerful extended radio galaxies\nis investigated here and found to be $t_*\\proptoL_j^{-2/3}$. A comparison of\nthe redshift evolution of the characteristic source sizes with that of the\naverage lobe-lobe size for the 3CR sample of radio galaxies could be used to\nconstrain cosmology.\n", "  We report observations obtained with the Keck adaptive optics facility of the\nnearby (d=9.8 pc) binary Gl~569. The system was known to be composed of a cool\nprimary (dM2) and a very cool secondary (dM8.5) with a separation of 5\" (49\nAstronomical Units). We have found that Gl~569~B is itself double with a\nseparation of only 0\".101$\\pm$0\".002 (1 Astronomical Unit). This detection\ndemonstrates the superb spatial resolution that can be achieved with adaptive\noptics at Keck. The difference in brightness between Gl~569~B and the companion\nis $\\sim$0.5 magnitudes in the J, H and K' bands. Thus, both objects have\nsimilarly red colors and very likely constitute a very low-mass binary system.\nFor reasonable assumptions about the age (0.12~Gyr--1.0~Gyr) and total mass of\nthe system (0.09~M$_\\odot$--0.15~M$_\\odot$), we estimate that the orbital\nperiod is $\\sim$3 years. Follow-up observations will allow us to obtain an\nastrometric orbit solution and will yield direct dynamical masses that can\nconstrain evolutionary models of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.\n", "  The prehistoric site of Vin\\u{c}a, on the right bank of the River Danube, the\nterritory of the City of Belgrade, first excavated by Dr Miloje Vasi\\'c;\n(1931-1934) provides Neolithic pottery dating back to 5200 - 4200 B.C. Shards\nexcavated in 1998 (Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts) have a yellow coating\non the external (convex) and red deposit on the internal (concave) side. Raman,\nIR and X-ray identification prove that yellow-to-red decor deposited on the\nexternal faces of pottery is made of ochre, a mixture of hematite, quartz and\nphyllosilicates. Red deposit, found on some internal surfaces of a pottery,\nconsists of cinnabar (HgS) with some quartz and phyllosilicates. This indicates\nthat cinnabar was not used for decor but for some other purposes, preparations\nmade in ceramic utensils. A comparison is made with the mercury ore from a\nSuplja Stena mine located ~ 20 km from the Vin\\u{c}a village.\n", "  The local environment of manganese atoms in LaMnO3 under pressure up to 15.3\nGPa has been studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy. For pressures below 8\nGPa, no change is detected within the MnO6 octahedra. Above this pressure a\ncontinuous reduction of the long Mn-O distance takes place, however the\noctahedral distortion persists over the whole pressure range. At 15.3 GPa the\naverage Jahn-Teller splitting of the distances is reduced by about one third,\nindicating that a total removal of the local Jahn-Teller distortion would occur\nonly for pressures around 30 GPa, where metallization is reported to take\nplace. A hysteresis in the long distance reduction is observed down to ambient\npressure, suggesting the coexistence of MnO6 distorted and undistorted units.\n", "  When submitted to gentle mechanical taps a granular packing slowly compacts\nuntil it reaches a stationary state that depends on the tap characteristics.\nThe properties of such stationary states are experimentally investigated. The\ninfluence of the initial state, taps properties and tapping protocol are\nstudied. The compactivity of the packings is determinated. Our results strongly\nsupport the idea that the stationary states are genuine thermodynamic states.\n", "  We have studied the statistics of plastic rearrangement events in a simulated\namorphous solid at T=0. Events are characterized by the energy release and the\n``slip volume'', the product of plastic strain and system volume. Their\ndistributions for a given system size $L$ appear to be exponential, but a\ncharacteristic event size cannot be inferred, because the mean values of these\nquantities increase as $L^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\sim 3/2$. In contrast to\nresults obtained in 2D models, we do not see simply connected avalanches. The\nexponent suggests a fractal shape of the avalanches, which is also evidenced by\nthe mean fractal dimension and participation ratio.\n", "  The oscillatory magnetoresistance spectrum of the organic metal\n(BEDO)$_5$Ni(CN)$_4\\cdot$3C$_2$H$_4$(OH)$_2$ has been studied up to 50 T, in\nthe temperature range from 1.5 K to 4.2 K. In high magnetic field, its Fermi\nsurface corresponds to a linear chain of quasi-two-dimensional orbits coupled\nby magnetic breakdown (MB). The scattering rate consistently deduced from the\ndata relevant to the basic $\\alpha$ and the MB-induced $\\beta$ orbits is very\nlarge which points to a significant reduction of the chemical potential\noscillation. Despite of this feature, the oscillations spectrum exhibits many\nfrequency combinations. Their effective masses and (or) Dingle temperature are\nnot in agreement with either the predictions of the quantum interference model\nor the semiclassical model of Falicov and Stachowiak.\n", "  The Andreev current through an ultrasmall NIS junction is calculated in a\nsystematic way by means of a nonlinear response approach basing on the\nelementary Hamiltonian of quasiparticle tunneling. The voltage dependence of\ncurrent and differential conductance as well as the Andreev conductance are\nderived for low- and high-impedance environments, respectively.\n", "  We constructed the one-particle spectral functions (diagonal and\noff-diagonal) which reproduce BCS for weak coupling and which take into account\nthe effect of correlations on superconductivity in the attractive Hubbard\nmodel. The diagonal spectral function is composed of three peaks and the\noff-diagonal one is composed of two peaks. This ansatz satisfies the sum rules\nfor the first six moments. Our solutions are valid for intermediate coupling,\ni.e., for $U/t \\approx -4.0$. Our set of analytical equations for the unknown\nvariables is self-consistent and has been solved numerically in lowest order of\nthe order parameter. As a result, we obtain that the presence of the third\nband, or {\\it upper Hubbard band}, strongly renormalizes the two lower bands,\nmaking that the energy gap be ${\\bf k}$-dependent while the order parameter is\npure s-wave. This shows that the order parameter and the gap are two different\nquantities.\n", "  The electronic distribution in devices with sufficiently small diemnsions may\nnot be in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings. Systems where the\noccupancies of electronic states are solely determined by tunneling processes\nare analyzed. It is shown that the effective temperature of the device may be\nhigher, or lower, than that of its environment, depending on the applied\nvoltage and the energy dependence of the tunneling rates. The I-V\ncharacteristics become asymmetric. Comparison with recent experiments is made.\n", "  We present simulation data for the motion of a polymer chain through a\nregular lattice of impenetrable obstacles (Evans-Edwards model). Chain lengths\nrange from N=20 to N=640, and time up to $10^{7}$ Monte Carlo steps. For $N\n\\geq 160$ we for the central segment find clear $t^{1/4}$-behavior as an\nintermediate asymptote. The also expected $t^{1/2}$-range is not yet developed.\nFor the end segment also the $t^{1/4}$-behavior is not reached. All these data\ncompare well to our recent analytical evaluation of the reptation model, which\nshows that for shorter times $(t \\alt 10^{4})$ the discreteness of the\nelementary motion cannot be neglected, whereas for longer times and short\nchains $(N \\alt 100)$ tube renewal plays an essential role also for the central\nsegment. Due to the very broad crossover behavior both the diffusion\ncoefficient and the reptation time within the range of our simulation do not\nreach the asymptotic power laws predicted by reptation theory. We present\nresults for the center-of-mass motion, showing the expected intermediate\n$t^{1/2}$-behavior, but again only for very long chains. In addition we show\nresults for the motion of the central segment relative to the center of mass,\nwhere in some intermediate range we see the expected increase of the effective\npower beyond the $t^{1/4}$-law, before saturation sets in. Analysis and\nsimulations agree on defining a new set of criteria as characteristic for\nreptation of finite chains.\n", "  We present a comparison of three different types of Langevin equation\nexhibiting absorbing states: the Langevin equation defining the Reggeon field\ntheory, one with multiplicative noise, and a third type in which the noise is\ncomplex. Each one is found to describe a different underlying physical\nmechanism; in particular, the nature of the different absorbing states depends\non the type of noise considered.\n  By studying the stationary single-site effective potential, we analyze the\nimpossibility of finding a reaction-diffusion model in the multiplicative noise\nuniversality class. We also discuss some theoretical questions related to the\nnature of complex noise, as for example, whether it is necessary or not to\nconsider a complex equation in order to describe processes as the annihilation\nreaction, $A +A \\to 0$.\n", "  Using angle-resolved synchrotron-radiation photoemission spectroscopy we have\ndetermined the dispersion of the valence bands of BeTe(100) along $\\Gamma X$,\ni.e. the [100] direction. The measurements are analyzed with the aid of a\nfirst-principles calculation of the BeTe bulk band structure as well as of the\nphotoemission peaks as given by the momentum conserving bulk transitions.\nTaking the calculated unoccupied bands as final states of the photoemission\nprocess, we obtain an excellent agreement between experimental and calculated\nspectra and a clear interpretation of almost all measured bands. In contrast,\nthe free electron approximation for the final states fails to describe the BeTe\nbulk band structure along $\\Gamma X$ properly.\n", "  We present a recently introduced real space renormalization group (RG)\napproach to the study of surface growth.\n  The method permits us to obtain the properties of the KPZ strong coupling\nfixed point, which is not accessible to standard perturbative field theory\napproaches. Using this method, and with the aid of small Monte Carlo\ncalculations for systems of linear size 2 and 4, we calculate the roughness\nexponent in dimensions up to d=8. The results agree with the known numerical\nvalues with good accuracy. Furthermore, the method permits us to predict the\nabsence of an upper critical dimension for KPZ contrarily to recent claims. The\nRG scheme is applied to other growth models in different universality classes\nand reproduces very well all the observed phenomenology and numerical results.\nIntended as a sort of finite size scaling method, the new scheme may simplify\nin some cases from a computational point of view the calculation of scaling\nexponents of growth processes.\n", "  Using the tetrad formalism, we carry out the separation of variables for the\nmassive complex Dirac equation in the gravitational and electromagnetic field\nof a four-parameter (mass, angular momentum, electric and magnetic charges)\nblack hole.\n", "  A large class of solutions of the Einstein-conformal scalar equations in\nD=2+1 and D=3+1 is identified. They describe the collisions of asymptotic\nconformal scalar waves and are generated from Einstein-minimally coupled scalar\nspacetimes via a (generalized) Bekenstein transformation. Particular emphasis\nis given to the study of the global properties and the singularity structure of\nthe obtained solutions. It is shown, that in the case of the absence of pure\ngravitational radiation in the initial data, the formation of the final\nsingularity is not only generic, but is even inevitable.\n", "  A practical method of calculating weights implementing the Bose - Einstein\ninterference effects is presented. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated\nfor the events generated by the JETSET/PYTHIA code to describe the UA1\nproton-antiproton data at 630GeV. A good description of data is achieved with a\nreasonable value of the Gaussian width of a two-particle weight factor, which\nis the only free parameter in our calculations.\n", "  A formalism describing the dynamics of classical and quantum systems from a\ngroup theoretical point of view is presented. We apply it to the simple example\nof the classical free particle. The Galileo group $G$ is the symmetry group of\nthe free equations of motion. Consideration of the free particle Lagrangian\nsemi-invariance under $G$ leads to a larger symmetry group, which is a central\nextension of the Galileo group by the real numbers. We study the dynamics\nassociated with this group, and characterize quantities like Noether invariants\nand evolution equations in terms of group geometric objects. An extension of\nthe Galileo group by U(1) leads to quantum mechanics.\n", "  The highest weight modules of the chiral algebra of orthogonal WZW models at\nlevel one possess a realization in fermionic representation spaces; the\nKac-Moody and Virasoro generators are represented as unbounded limits of even\nCAR algebras. It is shown that the representation theory of the underlying even\nCAR algebras reproduces precisely the sectors of the chiral algebra. This fact\nallows to develop a theory of local von Neumann algebras on the punctured\ncircle, fitting nicely in the Doplicher-Haag-Roberts framework. The relevant\nlocalized endomorphisms which generate the charged sectors are explicitly\nconstructed by means of Bogoliubov transformations. Using CAR theory, the\nfusion rules in terms of sector equivalence classes are proven.\n", "  The LiH$^{+}$ molecule is prototypical of the indirect dissociative\nrecombination (DR) process, in which a colliding electron destroys the molecule\nthrough Rydberg capture pathways. This Letter develops the first quantitative\ntest of the Siegert state multichannel quantum defect theory description of\nindirect DR for a diatomic molecular ion. The R-matrix approach is adopted to\ncalculate ab-initio quantum defects, functions of the internuclear distance\nthat characterize both Rydberg states and the zero-energy collisions of\nelectrons with LiH$^{+}$ ions. The calculated DR rate coefficient agrees\naccurately with recent experimental data (S. Krohn et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86,\n4005). We identify the doorways to fast indirect DR as complex resonance\nmanifolds, which couple closed channels having both high and low principal\nquantum numbers. This sheds new light on the competition between direct and\nindirect DR pathways, and suggests the reason why previous theory\nunderestimated the DR rate by an order of magnitude.\n", "  The separability problem is formulated in terms of a characterization of a\nsingle entanglement witness. More specifically, we show that any (in general\nmultipartite) state \\varrho is separable if and only if a specially constructed\nentanglement witness W_{\\varrho} is weakly optimal, i.e., its expectation value\nvanishes on at least one product vector. Interestingly, the witness can always\nbe chosen to be decomposable. Our result changes the conceptual aspect of the\nseparability problem and rises some questions about properties of positive\nmaps.\n"]}
