The\nexistence of global in time nearby Maxwellian solutions is known from [34] in\n2006. However the asymptotic behavior of these solutions has been a challenging\nopen problem. Building on our previous work [10] on time decay for the simpler\nVlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system, we prove that these solutions converge to the\nglobal Maxwellian with the optimal decay rate of $O(t^{-3/2+\\frac{3}{2r}})$ in\n$L^2_\\xi(L^r_x)$-norm for any $2\\leq r\\leq \\infty$ if initial perturbation is\nsmooth enough and decays in space-velocity fast enough at infinity. Moreover,\nsome explicit rates for the electromagnetic field tending to zero are also\nprovided.\n", "  This article provides sharp constructive upper and lower bound estimates for\nthe non-linear Boltzmann collision operator with the full range of physical non\ncut-off collision kernels ($\\gamma > -n$ and $s\\in (0,1)$) in the trilinear\n$L^2(\\R^n)$ energy $<\\mathcal{Q}(g,f),f>$. These new estimates prove that, for\na very general class of $g(v)$, the global diffusive behavior (on $f$) in the\nenergy space is that of the geometric fractional derivative semi-norm\nidentified in the linearized context in our earlier works [2009, 2010, 2010\narXiv:1011.5441v1]. We further prove new global entropy production estimates\nwith the same anisotropic semi-norm. This resolves the longstanding, widespread\nheuristic conjecture about the sharp diffusive nature of the non cut-off\nBoltzmann collision operator in the energy space $L^2(\\R^n)$.\n", "  In this paper we study the large-time behavior of perturbative classical\nsolutions to the hard and soft potential Boltzmann equation without the angular\ncut-off assumption in the whole space $\\threed_x$ with $\\DgE$. We use the\nexistence theory of global in time nearby Maxwellian solutions from\n\\cite{gsNonCutA,gsNonCut0}. It has been a longstanding open problem to\ndetermine the large time decay rates for the soft potential Boltzmann equation\nin the whole space, with or without the angular cut-off assumption\n\\cite{MR677262,MR2847536}. For perturbative initial data, we prove that\nsolutions converge to the global Maxwellian with the optimal large-time decay\nrate of $O(t^{-\\frac{\\Ndim}{2}+\\frac{\\Ndim}{2r}})$ in the\n$L^2_\\vel(L^r_x)$-norm for any $2\\leq r\\leq \\infty$.\n", "  In the study of solutions to the relativistic Boltzmann equation, their\nregularity with respect to the momentum variables has been an outstanding\nquestion, even local in time, due to the initially unexpected growth in the\npost-collisional momentum variables which was discovered in 1991 by Glassey &\nStrauss \\cite{MR1105532}. We establish momentum regularity within energy spaces\nvia a new splitting technique and interplay between the Glassey-Strauss frame\nand the center of mass frame of the relativistic collision operator. In a\nperiodic box, these new momentum regularity estimates lead to a proof of global\nexistence of classical solutions to the two-species relativistic\nVlasov-Boltzmann-Maxwell system for charged particles near Maxwellian with hard\nball interaction.\n", "  In this paper we prove the global in time well-posedness of the following\nnon-local diffusion equation with $\\alpha \\in[0,2/3)$: $$ \\partial_t u =\n{(-\\triangle)^{-1}u} \\triangle u + \\alpha u^2, \\quad u(t=0) = u_0. $$ The\ninitial condition $u_0$ is positive, radial, and non-increasing with $u_0\\in\nL^1\\cap L^{2+\\delta}(\\threed)$ for some small $\\delta >0$. There is no size\nrestriction on $u_0$. This model problem appears of interest due to its\nstructural similarity with Landau's equation from plasma physics, and moreover\nits radically different behavior from the semi-linear Heat equation: $u_t =\n\\triangle u + \\alpha u^2$.\n", "  We study the infrared properties of SU(3) gauge theory coupled to 12 massless\nDirac fermions in the fundamental representation. The renormalized running\ncoupling constant is calculated in the Twisted Polyakov loop scheme on the\nlattice. From the step-scaling analysis, we find that the infrared behavior of\nthe theory is governed by a non-trivial fixed point.\n", "  Using the screened Cornell potential and the next-to-leading order\nperturbative QCD to determine, respectively, the properties of bottomonia and\ntheir dissociation cross sections in a quark-gluon plasma, we study in a 2+1\nideal hydrodynamics the effect of initial fluctuations on bottomonia production\nin relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We find that while initial fluctuations\nhardly affect the yield of the 1S ground state bottomonium, their effect on\nthat of excited bottomonium states is not small. Compared to the case with\nsmooth initial conditions, the survival probability of excited bottomonia is\nreduced at low transverse momentum and increased at high transverse momentum.\nThe observed suppression of the excited bottomonia relative to the ground state\nbottomonium by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) collaborations at an average\ntransverse momentum can, however, be described at present with both smooth and\nfluctuating initial conditions.\n", "  We address the issue of the relation between the canonical functional\nSchr\\\"odinger representation in quantum field theory and the approach of\nprecanonical field quantization proposed by the author, which requires neither\na distinguished time variable nor infinite-dimensional spaces of field\nconfigurations. We argue that the standard functional derivative Schr\\\"odinger\nequation can be derived from the precanonical Dirac-like covariant\ngeneralization of the Schr\\\"odinger equation under the formal limiting\ntransition $\\gamma^0\\varkappa\\rightarrow\\delta(\\mathbf{0})$, where the constant\n$\\varkappa$ naturally appears within the precanonical quantization as the\ninverse of a small \"elementary volume\" of space. We obtain a formal explicit\nexpression of the Schr\\\"odinger wave functional as a continuous product of the\nDirac algebra valued precanonical wave functions, which are defined on the\nfinite-dimensional covariant configuration space of the field variables and\nspace-time variables.\n", "  For the Landau-Poisson system with Coulomb interaction in $\\R^3_x$, we prove\nthe global existence, uniqueness, and large time convergence rates to the\nMaxwellian equilibrium for solutions which start out sufficiently close.\n", "  In this article we prove a collection of new non-linear and non-local\nintegral inequalities. As an example for $u\\ge 0$ and $p\\in (0,\\infty)$ we\nobtain $$ \\int_{\\threed} dx ~ u^{p+1}(x) \\le (\\frac{p+1}{p})^2 \\int_{\\threed}\ndx ~ \\{(-\\triangle)^{-1} u(x) \\} \\nsm \\nabla u^{\\frac{p}{2}}(x)\\nsm^2. $$ We\nuse these inequalities to deduce global existence of solutions to a non-local\nheat equation with a quadratic non-linearity for large radial monotonic\npositive initial conditions. Specifically, we improve \\cite{ksLM} to include\nall $\\alpha\\in (0, 74/75)$.\n", "  We prove that $k$-th order derivatives of perturbative classical solutions to\nthe hard and soft potential Boltzmann equation (without the angular cut-off\nassumption) in the whole space, ${\\mathbb R}^{n}_x$ with $n \\ge 3$, converge in\nlarge-time to the global Maxwellian with the optimal decay rate of\n$O(t^{-1/2(k+\\varrho+\\frac{n}{2}-\\frac{n}{r})})$ in the $L^r_x(L^2_{v})$-norm\nfor any $2\\leq r\\leq \\infty$. These results hold for any $\\varrho \\in [0, n/2]$\nas long as initially $\\| f_0|_{\\dot{B}^{-\\varrho,\\infty}_2 L^2_{v}} < \\infty$.\nIn the hard potential case, we prove faster decay results in the sense that if\n$|\\mathbf{P} f_0\\|_{\\dot{B}^{-\\varrho,\\infty}_2 L^2_{v}} < \\infty$ and\n$|({\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{P}}) f_0|_{\\dot{B}^{-\\varrho+1,\\infty}_2 L^2_{v}} <\n\\infty$ for $\\varrho \\in (n/2, (n+2)/2]$ then the solution decays to zero in\n$L^2_v(L^2_x)$ with the optimal large time decay rate of $O(t^{-1/2\\varrho})$.\n", "  von Laue's theorem, as well as its generalized form, is strictly proved in\ndetail for its sufficient and necessary condition (SNC). This SNC version of\nLaue's theorem is used to analyze the infinitely extended electrostatic field\nproduced by a charged metal sphere in free space, and the static field confined\nin a finite region of space. It is shown in general that the total (Abraham =\nMinkowski) EM momentum and energy for the electrostatic field cannot constitute\na Lorentz four-vector. A derivative von Laue's theorem, which provides a\ncriterion for a Lorentz invariant, is also presented.\n", "  In this paper, we show that via a novel construction every rank-3 root system\ninduces a root system of rank 4. Via the Cartan-Dieudonn\\'e theorem, an even\nnumber of successive Coxeter reflections yields rotations that in a Clifford\nalgebra framework are described by spinors. In three dimensions these spinors\nthemselves have a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure, and discrete\nspinor groups can therefore be interpreted as 4D polytopes. In fact, we show\nthat these polytopes have to be root systems, thereby inducing Coxeter groups\nof rank 4, and that their automorphism groups include two factors of the\nrespective discrete spinor groups trivially acting on the left and on the right\nby spinor multiplication. Special cases of this general theorem include the\nexceptional 4D groups $D_4$, $F_4$ and $H_4$, which therefore opens up a new\nunderstanding of applications of these structures in terms of spinorial\ngeometry. In particular, 4D groups are ubiquitous in high energy physics. For\nthe corresponding case in two dimensions, the groups $I_2(n)$ are shown to be\nself-dual, whilst via a similar construction in terms of octonions each rank-3\nroot system induces a root system in dimension 8; this root system is in fact\nthe direct sum of two copies of the corresponding induced 4D root system.\n", "  Heavy isocurvature fields may have a strong influence on the low energy\ndynamics of curvature perturbations during inflation, as long as the\ninflationary trajectory becomes non-geodesic in the multi-field target space\n(the landscape). If fields orthogonal to the inflationary trajectory are\nsufficiently heavy, one expects a reliable effective field theory describing\nthe low energy dynamics of curvature perturbations, with self-interactions\ndetermined by the shape of the inflationary trajectory. Previous work analyzing\nthe role of heavy-fields during inflation have mostly focused in the effects on\ncurvature perturbations due to a single heavy-field. In this article we extend\nthe results of these works by studying models of inflation in which curvature\nperturbations interact with two heavy-fields. We show that the second\nheavy-field (orthogonal to both tangent and normal directions of the\ninflationary trajectory) may significantly affect the evolution of curvature\nmodes. We compute the effective field theory for the low energy curvature\nperturbations obtained by integrating out the two heavy-fields and show that\nthe presence of the second heavy-field implies the existence of additional\nself-interactions not accounted for in the single heavy-field case. We conclude\nthat future observations will be able to constrain the number of heavy fields\ninteracting with curvature perturbations.\n", "  We describe a new class of models of quantum space-time based on energetic\ncausal sets and show that under natural conditions space-time emerges from\nthem. These are causal sets whose causal links are labelled by energy and\nmomentum and conservation laws are applied at events. The models are motivated\nby principles we propose govern microscopic physics which posit a fundamental\nirreversibility of time. One consequence is that each event in the history of\nthe universe has a distinct causal relationship to the rest; this requires a\nnovel form of dynamics which an be applied to uniquely distinctive events. We\nhence introduce a new kind of deterministic dynamics for a causal set in which\nnew events are generated from pairs of progenitor events by a rule which is\nbased on extremizing the distinctions between causal past sets of events. This\ndynamics is asymmetric in time, but we find evidence from numerical simulations\nof a 1+1 dimensional model, that an effective dynamics emerges which restores\napproximate time reversal symmetry. Energetic causal set models differ from\nother spacetime-free causal set approaches, e.g. Ref. [1] proposed causal sets\nbased on quantum information processing systems, and Ref. [2] proposed causal\nsets constructed out of standard model particles. Finally we also present a\nnatural twistorial representation of energetic causal sets.\n", "  Gravitational waves with parallel rays are known to have remarkable\nproperties: Their orbit space of null rays possesses the structure of a\nnon-relativistic spacetime of codimension-one. Their geodesics are in\none-to-one correspondence with dynamical trajectories of a non-relativistic\nsystem. Similarly, the null dimensional reduction of Klein-Gordon's equation on\nthis class of gravitational waves leads to a Schroedinger equation on curved\nspace. These properties are generalized to the class of gravitational waves\nwith a null Killing vector field, of which we propose a new geometric\ndefinition, as conformally equivalent to the previous class and such that the\nKilling vector field is preserved. This definition is instrumental for\nperforming this generalization, as well as various applications. In particular,\nresults on geodesic completeness are extended in a similar way. Moreover, the\nclassification of the subclass with constant scalar invariants is investigated.\n", "  We propose an approach to quantum theory based on the energetic causal sets,\nintroduced in Cort\\^{e}s and Smolin (2013). Fundamental processes are causal\nsets whose events carry momentum and energy, which are transmitted along causal\nlinks and conserved at each event. Energetic causal set models differ from\nother spacetime-free causal set approaches, e.g. Ref. [2] proposed causal sets\nbased on quantum information processing systems, and Ref. [3] proposed causal\nsets constructed out of standard model particles. Fundamentally there are\namplitudes for causal processes in energetic causal sets, but no space-time. An\nembedding of the causal processes in an emergent space-time arises only at the\nsemiclassical level. Hence, fundamentally there are no commutation relations,\nno uncertainty principle and, indeed, no $\\hbar$. All that remains of quantum\ntheory is the relationship between the absolute value squared of complex\namplitudes and probabilities. Consequently, we find that neither locality, nor\nnon locality, are primary concepts, only causality exists at the fundamental\nlevel.\n", "  An intriguing problem in climate science is the existence of Earth's glacial\ncycles. We show that it is possible to generate these periodic changes in\nclimate by means of the Earth's carbon cycle as the main determinant factor.\nThe carbon exchange between the Ocean, the Continent and the Atmosphere is\nmodeled by means of a tridimensional Lotka-Volterra system and the resulting\natmospheric carbon cycle is used as the unique radiative forcing mechanism. It\nis shown that the carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) and temperature anomaly curves,\nwhich are thus obtained, have the same first-order structure as the 100 kyr\nglacial--interglacial cycles depicted by the Vostok ice core data, reproducing\nthe asymmetries of rapid heating--slow cooling, and short interglacial--long\nglacial ages.\n", "  In this paper we systematically classify and describe bosonic symmetry\nprotected topological (SPT) phases in all physical spatial dimensions using\nsemiclassical nonlinear Sigma model (NLSM) field theories. All the SPT phases\non a $d-$dimensional lattice discussed in this paper can be described by the\nsame NLSM, which is an O(d+2) NLSM in $(d+1)-$dimensional space-time, with a\ntopological $\\Theta-$term. The field in the NLSM is a semiclassical Landau\norder parameter with a unit length constraint. The classification of SPT phases\ndiscussed in this paper based on their NLSMs is consistent with the more\nmathematical classification based on group cohomology. Besides the\nclassification, the formalism used in this paper also allows us to explicitly\ndiscuss the physics at the boundary of the SPT phases, and it reveals the\nrelation between SPT phases with different symmetries. For example, it gives\nmany of these SPT states a natural \"decorated defect\" construction.\n", "  In this paper for either the sharp front Surface Quasi-Geostrophic equation\nor the Muskat problem we rule out the \"splash singularity\" blow-up scenario; in\nother words we prove that the contours evolving from either of these systems\ncan not intersect at a single point while the free boundary remains smooth.\nSplash singularities have been shown to hold for the free boundary\nincompressible Euler equation in the form of the water waves contour evolution\nproblem \\cite{ADCPJ}. Our result confirms the numerical simulations in\n\\cite{CFMR} where it is shown that the curvature blows up due to the contours\ncollapsing at a point. Here we prove that maintaining control of the curvature\nwill remove the possibility of pointwise interphase collapse. Another\nconclusion that we provide is a better understanding of the work \\cite{DP3} in\nwhich squirt singularities are ruled out; here a positive volume of fluid\nbetween the contours can not be ejected in finite time.\n", "  Complete positivity of quantum dynamics is often viewed as a litmus test for\nphysicality, yet it is well known that correlated initial states need not give\nrise to completely positive evolutions. This observation spurred numerous\ninvestigations over the past two decades attempting to identify necessary and\nsufficient conditions for complete positivity. Here we describe a complete and\nconsistent mathematical framework for the discussion and analysis of complete\npositivity for correlated initial states of open quantum systems. This\nformalism is built upon a few simple axioms and is sufficiently general to\ncontain all prior methodologies going back to Pechakas, PRL (1994). The key\nobservation is that initial system-bath states with the same reduced state on\nthe system must evolve under all admissible unitary operators to system-bath\nstates with the same reduced state on the system, in order to ensure that the\ninduced dynamical maps on the system are well-defined. Once this consistency\ncondition is imposed, related concepts like the assignment map and the\ndynamical maps are uniquely defined. In general, the dynamical maps may not be\napplied to arbitrary system states, but only to those in an appropriately\ndefined physical domain. We show that the constrained nature of the problem\ngives rise to not one but three inequivalent types of complete positivity.\nUsing this framework we elucidate the limitations of recent attempts to provide\nconditions for complete positivity using quantum discord and the quantum\ndata-processing inequality. The problem remains open, and may require fresh\nperspectives and new mathematical tools. The formalism presented herein may be\none step in that direction.\n", "  Numerical modelling of convection driven dynamos in the Boussinesq\napproximation revealed fundamental characteristics of the dynamo-generated\nmagnetic fields and the fluid flow. Because these results were obtained for an\nincompressible fluid, their validity for gas planets and stars remains to be\nassessed. A common approach is to take some density stratification into account\nwith the so-called anelastic approximation. The validity of previous results\nobtained in the Boussinesq approximation is tested for anelastic models. We\npoint out and explain specific differences between both types of models, in\nparticular with respect to the field geometry and the field strength, but we\nalso compare scaling laws for the velocity amplitude, the magnetic dissipation\ntime, and the convective heat flux. Our investigation is based on a systematic\nparameter study of spherical dynamo models in the anelastic approximation. We\nmake use of a recently developed numerical solver and provide results for the\ntest cases of the anelastic dynamo benchmark. The dichotomy of dipolar and\nmultipolar dynamos identified in Boussinesq simulations is also present in our\nsample of anelastic models. Dipolar models require that the typical length\nscale of convection is an order of magnitude larger than the Rossby radius.\nHowever, the distinction between both classes of models is somewhat less\nexplicit than in previous studies. This is mainly due to two reasons: we found\na number of models with a considerable equatorial dipole contribution and an\nintermediate overall dipole field strength. Furthermore, a large density\nstratification may hamper the generation of dipole dominated magnetic fields.\nPreviously proposed scaling laws, such as those for the field strength, are\nsimilarly applicable to anelastic models. It is not clear, however, if this\nconsistency necessarily implies similar dynamo processes in both settings.\n", "  A variety of real world and experimental systems can display a drastic regime\nshift, as the evolution in one its paramaters crosses a threshold value.\nAssimilation of such a transition with a bifurcation has allowed to identify so\ncalled \"early warning signals\", at the level of the time series generated by\nthe system underscope. The literature in early warning detection methods is\ncurrently expanding and their potential for practical applicability is being\ndiscussed in different contexts. In this work, we elaborate on the use of the\nvariance of a system variable, which constitutes the simplest early warning\nindicator, to gain control on the long-term dynamics of the system, while\nextending an exploitation phase. In particular, we address the cases of the\ncusp and Hopf normal forms, as prototypical examples of bistability and\noscillations. Our results provide insights on the interplay between the\ntime-scale for the system observation, the degree of sensitivity of the control\nfeedback and the intensity of the random perturbations, in shaping the\nlong-term control efficiency.\n", "  Crystalline organic semiconductors, bonded by weak van der Waals forces,\nexhibit macroscopic properties that are very similar to those of inorganic\nsemiconductors. While there are many open questions concerning the microscopic\nnature of charge transport, minimizing the density of trap states (trap DOS) is\ncrucial to elucidate the intrinsic transport mechanism.\n  We explore the limits of state-of-the-art organic crystals by measuring\nsingle crystalline rubrene field-effect transistors that show textbook like\ntransfer characteristics, indicating a very low trap DOS. Particularly, the\nhigh purity of the crystals and the very clean interface to the gate dielectric\nare reflected in an unprecedentedly low subthreshold swing of 65 ${\\rm mV /\ndecade}$, remarkably close to the fundamental limit of $58.5 {\\rm mV /\ndecade}$.\n  From the measured subthreshold behavior we have consistently quantified the\ntrap DOS by two different methods, yielding an exceedingly low trap density of\n$D_{bulk} = 1 \\times 10^{13}~{\\rm cm^{-3}eV^{-1}}$ at an energy of\n$\\sim0.62~{\\rm eV}$. These numbers correspond to one trap per eV in $10^8$\nrubrene molecules. The equivalent density of traps located at the interface is\n$D_{it} = 3 \\times 10^{9}~{\\rm cm^{-2}eV^{-1}}$ which puts them on par with the\nbest crystalline ${\\rm SiO_2/Si}$ field-effect transistors.\n", "  We investigate the applicability of the two existing versions of a\ntime-dependent Gutzwiller approximation (TDGA) beyond the frequently used limit\nof infinite spatial dimensions. To this end, we study the two-particle response\nfunctions of a two-site Hubbard model where we can compare the exact results\nand those derived from the TDGA. It turns out that only the more recently\nintroduced version of the TDGA can be combined with a diagrammatic approach\nwhich allows for the evaluation of Gutzwiller wave functions in finite\ndimensions. For this TDGA method we derive the time-dependent Lagrangian for\ngeneral single-band Hubbard models.\n", "  We find that a symbolic walk (performed by a walker with memory given by a\nBernoulli shift) is able to distinguish between the random or chaotic topology\nof a given network. We show this result by means of studying the undirected\nbaker network, which is defined by following the Ulam approach for the baker\ntransformation in order to introduce the effect of deterministic chaos into its\nstructure. The chaotic topology is revealed through the central role played by\nthe nodes associated with the positions corresponding to the shortest periodic\norbits of the generating map. They are the overwhelmingly most visited nodes in\nthe limit cycles at which the symbolic walker asymptotically arrives. Our\nfindings contribute to link deterministic chaotic dynamics with the properties\nof networks constructed using the Ulam approach.\n", "  Probing the properties of the discovered Higgs boson may tell us whether or\nnot it is the same particle as the one predicted by the Standard Model. To this\naim we parametrize deviations of the Higgs couplings to matter from the\nStandard Model by using the Higgs Effective Field Theory framework. Starting\nwith a general dimension-6 effective Lagrangian including both CP-even and\nCP-odd operators, and requiring that the operators do not introduce power\ndivergences in the oblique parameters, we reduce the number of independent\neffective couplings of the theory. This framework is then used to put updated\nconstraints on the effective couplings, using the latest Higgs rates data from\nthe Run-I of the ATLAS and CMS experiments, and electroweak precision data from\nLEP, SLC and Tevatron. We show that the current data is able to significantly\nconstrain the CP-even and some CP-odd operators of the effective Lagrangian.\n", "  The global existence of solutions to the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system\ngiven sufficiently regular finite energy initial data is a longstanding open\nproblem. The main result of Glassey-Strauss (1986) shows that a solution $(f,\nE, B)$ remains $C^1$ as long as the momentum support of $f$ remains bounded.\nAlternate proofs were later given by Bouchut-Golse-Pallard (2003) and\nKlainerman-Staffilani (2002). We show that only the boundedness of the momentum\nsupport of $f$ after projecting to any two dimensional plane is needed for $(f,\nE, B)$ to remain $C^1$.\n", "  Consider the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system with initial data of\nunrestricted size. In the two dimensional and the two and a half dimensional\ncases, Glassey-Schaeffer (1997, 1998, 1998) proved that for regular initial\ndata with compact momentum support this system has unique global in time\nclassical solutions. In this work we do not assume compact momentum support for\nthe initial data and instead require only that the data have polynomial decay\nin momentum space. In the 2D and the $2\\frac 12$D cases, we prove the global\nexistence, uniqueness and regularity for solutions arising from this class of\ninitial data. To this end we use Strichartz estimates and prove that suitable\nmoments of the solution remain bounded. Moreover, we obtain a slight\nimprovement of the temporal growth of the $L^\\infty_x$ norms of the\nelectromagnetic fields compared to Glassey-Schaeffer.\n", "  We consider the $3$-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell system with data\nwithout compact support in momentum space. We prove two continuation criteria\nfor solutions to this system. First, we show that a regular solution can be\ncontinued if the integral of the electromagnetic field along any characteristic\nis assumed to be bounded. This can be viewed as a generalization of the\nclassical result of Glassey-Strauss (1986) to data with non-compact momentum\nsupport. Second, we extend the methods in our companion paper (Part I) to show\nthat a regular solution can be extended as long as $\\|\\pel_0^{\\th} f\n\\|_{L^q_xL^1_{\\pel}}$ remains bounded for $\\th>\\frac 2q$, $2<q\\leq \\infty$.\nThis improves previous results of Pallard (2005).\n", "  We analyse the structure of semiclassical and microlocal Wigner measures for\nsolutions to the linear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation on the disk, with Dirichlet\nboundary conditions.\n  Our approach links the propagation of singularities beyond geometric optics\nwith the completely integrable nature of the billiard in the disk. We prove a\n\"structure theorem\", expressing the restriction of the Wigner measures on each\ninvariant torus in terms of {\\em second-microlocal measures}. They are obtained\nby performing a finer localization in phase space around each of these tori, at\nthe limit of the uncertainty principle, and are shown to propagate according to\nHeisenberg equations on the circle.\n  Our construction yields as corollaries (a) that the disintegration of the\nWigner measures is absolutely continuous in the angular variable, which is an\nexpression of the dispersive properties of the equation; (b) an observability\ninequality, saying that the $L^2$-norm of a solution on any open subset\nintersecting the boundary (resp. the $L^2$-norm of the Neumann trace on any\nnonempty open set of the boundary) controls its full $L^2$-norm (resp.\n$H^1$-norm). These results show in particular that the energy of solutions\ncannot concentrate on periodic trajectories of the billiard flow other than the\nboundary.\n", "  In the present contribution, by studying a fractional version of Dirac's\nequation for the electron, we show that the phenomenon of Zitterbewegung in a\ncoarse-grained medium exhibits a transient oscillatory behavior, rather than a\npurely oscillatory regime, as it occurs in the integer case, $\\alpha=1$. Our\nresult suggests that, in such systems, the Zitterbewegung-type term related to\na trembling motion of a quasiparticle is tamed by its complex interactions with\nother particles and the medium. This can justify the difficulties in the\nobservation of this interesting phenomenon. The possibility that the\nZitterbewegung be accompanied by a damping factor supports the viewpoint of\nparticle substructures in Quantum Mechanics.\n", "  Understanding differential rotation of Sun-like stars is of great importance\nfor insight into the angular momentum transport in these stars. One means of\ngaining such information is that of asteroseismology. By a forward modeling\napproach we analyze in a qualitative manner the impact of different\ndifferential rotation profiles on the splittings of p-mode oscillation\nfrequencies. The optimum modes for inference on differential rotation are\nidentified along with the best value of the stellar inclination angle. We find\nthat in general it is not likely that asteroseismology can be used to make an\nunambiguous distinction between a rotation profile such as, e.g., a conical\nSun-like profile and a cylindrical profile. In addition, it seems unlikely that\nasteroseismology of Sun-like stars will result in inferences on the radial\nprofile of the differential rotation, such as can be done for, e.g., red\ngiants. At best one could possibly obtain the sign of the radial differential\nrotation gradient. Measurements of the extent of the latitudinal differential\nfrom frequency splitting are, however, more promising. One very interesting\naspect that could likely be tested from frequency splittings is whether the\ndifferential rotation is solar-like or anti-solar-like in nature, in the sense\nthat a solar-like profile has an equator rotating faster than the poles.\n", "  We provide a general method to calculate and maximize the purity of a qubit\ninteracting with an anisotropic non-Markovian environment. Counter to\nintuition, we find that the purity is often maximized by preparing and storing\nthe qubit in a superposition of non-interacting eigenstates. For a model\nrelevant to decoherence of a heavy-hole spin qubit in a quantum dot or for a\nsinglet-triplet qubit for two electrons in a double quantum dot, we show that\npreparation of the qubit in its non-interacting ground state can actually be\nthe worst choice to maximize purity. We further give analytical results for\nspin-echo envelope modulations of arbitrary spin components of a hole spin in a\nquantum dot, going beyond a standard secular approximation. We account for\ngeneral dynamics in the presence of a pure-dephasing process and identify a\ncrossover timescale at which it is again advantageous to initialize the qubit\nin the non-interacting ground state. Finally, we consider a general two-axis\ndynamical decoupling sequence and determine initial conditions that maximize\npurity, minimizing leakage to the environment.\n", "  The basic stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface\ngravity and global metallicity) were simultaneously determined for a sample of\n233 stars, limited in magnitude ($V<15$) with spectral types between G0 and G3\nand luminosity class V (main sequence). The analysis was based on spectroscopic\nobservations collected at the Observatorio Astrof\\'isico Guillermo Haro and\nusing a set of Lick-like indices defined in the spectral range of 3800-4800\n$\\AA$. An extensive set of indices computed in a grid of theoretical spectra\nwas used as a comparison tool in order to determine the photospheric\nparameters. The method was validated by matching the results from spectra of\nthe asteroids Vesta and Ceres with the Sun parameters. The main results were:\ni) the photospheric parameters were determined for the first time for 213\nobjects in our sample; ii) a sample of 20 new super metal-rich stars candidates\nwas found.\n", "  We study the properties of spin-polarized neutron matter at\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory,\nincluding two-, three-, and four-neutron interactions. The energy of\nspin-polarized neutrons is remarkably close to a non-interacting system at\nleast up to saturation density, where interaction effects provide less than 10%\ncorrections. This shows that the physics of neutron matter is similar to a\nunitary gas well beyond the scattering-length regime. Implications for\nenergy-density functionals and for a possible ferromagnetic transition in\nneutron stars are discussed. Our predictions can be tested with lattice QCD,\nand we present results for varying pion mass.\n", "  Non-local observables play an important role in quantum theory, from Bell\ninequalities and various post-selection paradoxes to quantum error correction\ncodes. Instantaneous measurement of these observables is known to be a\ndifficult problem, especially when the measurements are projective. The\nstandard von Neumann Hamiltonian used to model projective measurements cannot\nbe implemented directly in a non-local scenario and can, in some cases, violate\ncausality. We present a scheme for effectively generating the von Neumann\nHamiltonian for non-local observables without the need to communicate and\nadapt. The protocol can be used to perform weak and strong (projective)\nmeasurements, as well as measurements at any intermediate strength. It can also\nbe used in practical situations beyond non-local measurements. We show how the\nprotocol can be used to probe a version of Hardy's paradox with both weak and\nstrong measurements. The outcomes of these measurements provide a non-intuitive\npicture of the pre- and post-selected system. Our results shed new light on the\ninterplay between quantum measurements, uncertainty, non-locality, causality\nand determinism.\n", "  Since core-collapse supernova simulations still struggle to produce robust\nneutrino-driven explosions in 3D, it has been proposed that asphericities\ncaused by convection in the progenitor might facilitate shock revival by\nboosting the activity of non-radial hydrodynamic instabilities in the\npost-shock region. We investigate this scenario in depth using 42 relativistic\n2D simulations with multi-group neutrino transport to examine the effects of\nvelocity and density perturbations in the progenitor for different perturbation\ngeometries that obey fundamental physical constraints (like the anelastic\ncondition). As a framework for analysing our results, we introduce\nsemi-empirical scaling laws relating neutrino heating, average turbulent\nvelocities in the gain region, and the shock deformation in the saturation\nlimit of non-radial instabilities. The squared turbulent Mach number, <Ma^2>,\nreflects the violence of aspherical motions in the gain layer, and explosive\nrunaway occurs for <Ma^2>~0.3, corresponding to a reduction of the critical\nneutrino luminosity by ~25% compared to 1D. In the light of this theory,\nprogenitor asphericities aid shock revival mainly by creating anisotropic mass\nflux onto the shock: Differential infall efficiently converts velocity\nperturbations in the progenitor into density perturbations (Delta rho/rho) at\nthe shock of the order of the initial convective Mach number Ma. The\nanisotropic mass flux and ram pressure deform the shock and thereby amplify\npost-shock turbulence. Large-scale (l=2,l=1) modes prove most conducive to\nshock revival, whereas small-scale perturbations require unrealistically high\nconvective Mach numbers. Initial density perturbations in the progenitor are\nonly of order Ma^2 and therefore play a subdominant role.\n", "  We present four ab initio axisymmetric core-collapse supernova simulations\nfor 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\\odot$ progenitors. All of the simulations yield\nexplosions and have been evolved for at least 1.2 seconds after core bounce and\n1 second after material first becomes unbound. Simulations were computed with\nour Chimera code employing spectral neutrino transport, special and general\nrelativistic transport effects, and state-of-the-art neutrino interactions.\nContinuing the evolution beyond 1 second allows explosions to develop more\nfully and the processes powering the explosions to become more clearly evident.\nWe compute explosion energy estimates, including the binding energy of the\nstellar envelope outside the shock, of 0.34, 0.88, 0.38, and 0.70 B ($10^{51}$\nergs) and increasing at 0.03, 0.15, 0.19, and 0.52 B s$^{-1}$, respectively,\nfor the 12, 15, 20, and 25 $M_\\odot$ models. Three models developed pronounced\nprolate shock morphologies, while the 20 $M_\\odot$ model, though exhibiting\nlobes and accretion streams like the other models, develops an approximately\nspherical, off-center shock as the explosion begins and then becomes moderately\nprolate $\\sim$600 ms after bounce. This reduces the explosion energy relative\nto the other models by reducing mass accretion during the critical explosion\npower-up phase. We examine the growth of the explosion energy in our models\nthrough detailed analyses of the energy sources and flows. We find that the 12\nand 20 $M_\\odot$ models have explosion energies comparable to that of the lower\nrange of observed explosion energies while the 15 and 25 $M_\\odot$ models are\nwithin the range of observed explosion energies, particularly considering the\nrate at which their explosion energies are increasing. The ejected $^{56}$Ni\nmasses given by our models are all within observational limits as are the\nproto-neutron star masses and kick velocities. (Truncated)\n", "  Recent theories of charge density wave (CDW) order in high temperature\nsuperconductors have predicted a primarily d CDW orbital symmetry. Here, we\nreport on the orbital symmetry of CDW order in the canonical cuprate\nsuperconductors La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 (LBCO) and YBa2Cu3O6.67 (YBCO), using\nresonant soft x-ray scattering and a model mapped to the CDW orbital symmetry.\nFrom measurements sensitive to the O sublattice, we conclude that LBCO has\npredominantly s' CDW orbital symmetry, in contrast to the d orbital symmetry\nrecently reported in other cuprates. Additionally, we show for YBCO that the\nCDW orbital symmetry differs along the a and b crystal axes and that these both\ndiffer from LBCO. This work highlights CDW orbital symmetry as an additional\nkey property that distinguishes the different cuprate families. We discuss how\nthe CDW symmetry may be related to the \"1/8--anomaly\" and to static spin\nordering.\n", "  We report on the investigation of a superconducting anharmonic multi-level\ncircuit that is coupled to a harmonic readout resonator. We observe\nmulti-photon transitions via virtual energy levels of our system up to the\nfifth excited state. The back-action of these higher-order excitations on our\nreadout device is analyzed quantitatively and demonstrated to be in accordance\nwith theoretical expectation. By applying a strong microwave drive we achieve\nmulti-photon dressing within our anharmonic circuit which is dynamically\ncoupled by a weak probe tone. The emerging higher-order Rabi sidebands and\nassociated Autler-Townes splittings involving up to five levels of the\ninvestigated anharmonic circuit are observed. Experimental results are in good\nagreement with master equation simulations.\n", "  In a two-player game, two cooperating but non communicating players, Alice\nand Bob, receive inputs taken from a probability distribution. Each of them\nproduces an output and they win the game if they satisfy some predicate on\ntheir inputs/outputs. The entangled value $\\omega^*(G)$ of a game $G$ is the\nmaximum probability that Alice and Bob can win the game if they are allowed to\nshare an entangled state prior to receiving their inputs.\n  The $n$-fold parallel repetition $G^n$ of $G$ consists of $n$ instances of\n$G$ where Alice and Bob receive all the inputs at the same time and must\nproduce all the outputs at the same time. They win $G^n$ if they win each\ninstance of $G$. Recently, there has been a series of works showing parallel\nrepetition with exponential decay for projection games [DSV13], games on the\nuniform distribution [CS14] and for free games, i.e. games on a product\ndistribution [JPY13].\n  This article is meant to be a follow up of [CS14], where we improve and\nsimplify several parts of our previous paper. Our main result is that for any\nfree game $G$ with value $\\omega^*(G)=1-\\varepsilon$, we have $\\omega^*(G^n)\n\\le (1 - \\varepsilon^2)^{\\Omega(\\frac{n}{\\log(l)})}$ where $l$ is the size of\nthe output set of the game. This result improves on both the results in [JPY13]\nand [CS14]. The framework we use can also be extended to free projection games.\nWe show that for a free projection game $G$ with value\n$\\omega^*(G)=1-\\varepsilon$, we have $\\omega^*(G^n) \\le (1 -\n\\varepsilon)^{\\Omega(n)}$.\n", "  We used multi-wavelength high-resolution data from ARIES, THEMIS, and SDO\ninstruments, to analyze a non-standard, C3.3 class flare produced within the\nactive region NOAA 11589 on 2012 October 16. Magnetic flux emergence and\ncancellation were continuously detected within the active region, the latter\nleading to the formation of two filaments.\n  Our aim is to identify the origins of the flare taking into account the\ncomplex dynamics of its close surroundings.\n  We analyzed the magnetic topology of the active region using a linear\nforce-free field extrapolation to derive its 3D magnetic configuration and the\nlocation of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) which are preferential sites for\nflaring activity. Because the active region's magnetic field was nonlinear\nforce-free, we completed a parametric study using different linear force-free\nfield extrapolations to demonstrate the robustness of the derived QSLs.\n  The topological analysis shows that the active region presented a complex\nmagnetic configuration comprising several QSLs. The considered data set\nsuggests that an emerging flux episode played a key role for triggering the\nflare. The emerging flux likely activated the complex system of QSLs leading to\nmultiple coronal magnetic reconnections within the QSLs. This scenario accounts\nfor the observed signatures: the two extended flare-ribbons developed at\nlocations matched by the photospheric footprints of the QSLs, and were\naccompanied with flare loops that formed above the two filaments which played\nno important role in the flare dynamics.\n  This is a typical example of a complex flare that can a-priori show standard\nflare signatures that are nevertheless impossible to interpret with any\nstandard model of eruptive or confined flare. We find that a topological\nanalysis however permitted to unveil the development of such complex sets of\nflare signatures.\n", "  A systematic structure of particle interactions is predicted within and\nbeyond the standard model. The proof is performed either on the basis of (A) a\ngeneralisable form of general relativity or, equivalently, (B) minimum\ninformation quantum gravity. The emerging structure comprises several chains of\ninteraction generations, one generation being partly realised by the\nelectroweak and the strong interaction. Further interactions have not yet been\nobserved but could be observable in high energy particle collision experiments\nin the future.\n", "  The early literature on black hole thermodynamics ignored the $P$-$V$ term\nassociated with the existence of a fundamental physical constant in the black\nhole solution. The inclusion of this constant in the first law becomes\ninconsistent with the Smarr relation. Once the missing $P$-$V$ term introduced\nis, it becomes customary to introduce it only in problems where there is a\nnegative cosmological constant. This practice is inherited from cosmological\napproaches which consider the quantity $-\\Lambda/8\\pi$ as the constant pressure\ndue to a cosmological fluid. However, the notions of pressure and thermodynamic\nvolume in black hole thermodynamics are very different from their counterparts\nin classical thermodynamics. From this point of view, there is \\textit{a\npriori} no compelling reason to not extend this notion of pressure and\nassociate a partial pressure with each external\" density $8\\pi T_{t}{}^{t}$. In\nthis work, we associate a partial pressure with a variable mass parameter as\nwell as with each $tt$ component of the effective stress-energy tensor\n$T_{\\text{eff} \\mu}{}^{\\nu}$ but not with the linear component of the\nelectromagnetic field. Using the field equations $G_{\\mu}{}^{\\nu}=8\\pi\nT_{\\text{eff} \\mu}{}^{\\nu}$, we derive universal expressions for the enthalpy,\ninternal energy, free energies, thermodynamic volume, equation of state, law of\ncorresponding states, criticality, and critical exponents of static\n(nonrotating) charged black holes, with possibly a variable mass parameter,\nwhether they are solutions to the Einstein field equations or not. We extend\nthe derivation to the case where the black hole is immersed in the field of a\nquintessence force and to the multiforce case. Many applications and extensions\nare considered, including applications to regular black holes derived in\nprevious and present work. No inconsistency has been noticed in their\nthermodynamics.\n", "  In systems with broken $U(1)$ symmetry, such as superfluids, superconductors\nor magnets, the symmetry restoration is driven by proliferation of topological\ndefects in the form of vortex loops. Here we discuss that in certain systems\nthe proliferation of topological defects can, by contrast, lead to the\nbreakdown of an additional symmetry. As a particular example we demonstrate\nthat this effect should take place in $s+is$ superconductors, which are widely\ndiscussed in connection with the Iron-based materials. In these systems a\nvortex excitation can create a \"bubble\" of fluctuating $Z_2$ order parameter.\nThermal excitation of vortices then leads to breakdown of $Z_2$ time-reversal\nsymmetry when the temperature is increased.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum (OAM) has gained great interest due to its most\nattractive feature of high dimensionality, and several ground-breaking\ndemonstrations in communication based on OAM multiplexing have been carried\nout. Accordingly, a rapid data-density growth from OAM multiplexing has posed a\ngreat challenge to the signal-processing layer. Meanwhile, in another area,\noptical signal-processing circuit based on photon-phonon conversion has\nreceived considerable attention and made rapid progress. Here, with an aim of\nfinding the intersection between OAM multiplexing and photon-phonon conversion,\nwe report on the observation of reversible OAM photon-phonon conversion. A\nspecific OAM state can be flexibly and controllably interconverted between\nphotonic and phononic domains via Brillouin photon-phonon coupling within the\ndecay time of acoustic signal, in which OAM and spin angular momentum are\nindependently conserved. Our result demonstrates the controllable OAM transfer\nbetween photons and phonons, shows the potential of using OAM multiplexing to\nextend the capacity of photon-phonon conversion based signal-processing scheme,\nand may trigger the development of OAM-multiplexed photon-phonon circuit.\n", "  By combining complementary optical techniques, photoluminescence and\ntime-resolved excited state absorption, we achieve a comprehensive picture of\nthe relaxation processes in the organic/inorganic hybrid system SP6/ZnO. We\nidentify two long-lived excited states of the organic molecules of which only\nthe lowest energy one, localized on the sexiphenyl backbone of the molecule, is\nfound to efficiently charge separate to the ZnO conduction band or radiatively\nrecombine. The other state, most likely localized on the spiro-linked biphenyl,\nrelaxes only by intersystem crossing to a long-lived, probably triplet state,\nthus acting as a sink of the excitation and limiting the charge separation\nefficiency.\n", "  This article looks at the combined constraints from a photometric and\nspectroscopic survey. These surveys will measure cosmology using weak lensing\n(WL), galaxy clustering, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and redshift space\ndistortions (RSD). We find, contrary to some findings in the recent literature,\nthat overlapping surveys can give important benefits when measuring dark\nenergy. We therefore try to clarify the status of this issue with a full\nforecast of two stage-IV surveys using a new approach to properly account for\ncovariance between the different probes in the overlapping samples. The benefit\nof the overlapping survey can be traced back to two factors: additional\nobservables and sample variance cancellation. Both needs to be taken into\naccount and contribute equally when combining 3D power spectrum and 2D\ncorrelations for lensing. With an analytic example we also illustrate that for\noptimal constraints, one should minimize the (Pearson) correlation coefficient\nbetween cosmological and nuisance parameters and maximize the one among\nnuisance parameters (e.g. galaxy bias) in the two samples. This can be achieved\nby increasing the overlap between the spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We\nshow how BAO, WL and RSD contribute to this benefit and also look at some other\nsurvey designs, such as photometric redshift errors and spectroscopic density.\n", "  We explore a connection between monogamy of non-locality and a weak\nmacroscopic locality condition: the locality of the average behaviour. These\nare revealed by our analysis as being two sides of the same coin.\n  Moreover, we exhibit a structural reason for both in the case of Bell-type\nmultipartite scenarios, shedding light on but also generalising the results in\nthe literature [Ramanathan et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 060405 (2001);\nPawlowski & Brukner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 030403 (2009)]. More specifically,\nwe show that, provided the number of particles in each site is large enough\ncompared to the number of allowed measurement settings, and whatever the\nmicroscopic state of the system, the macroscopic average behaviour is local\nrealistic, or equivalently, general multipartite monogamy relations hold.\n  This result relies on a classical mathematical theorem by Vorob'ev [Theory\nProbab. Appl. 7(2), 147-163 (1962)] about extending compatible families of\nprobability distributions defined on the faces of a simplicial complex -- in\nthe language of the sheaf-theoretic framework of Abramsky & Brandenburger [New\nJ. Phys. 13, 113036 (2011)], such families correspond to no-signalling\nempirical models, and the existence of an extension corresponds to locality or\nnon-contextuality. Since Vorob'ev's theorem depends solely on the structure of\nthe simplicial complex, which encodes the compatibility of the measurements,\nand not on the specific probability distributions (i.e. the empirical models),\nour result about monogamy relations and locality of macroscopic averages holds\nnot just for quantum theory, but for any empirical model satisfying the\nno-signalling condition.\n  In this extended abstract, we illustrate our approach by working out a couple\nof examples, which convey the intuition behind our analysis while keeping the\ndiscussion at an elementary level.\n", "  We define an infinite dimensional modification of lower-semicomputability of\ndensity operators by G\\'acs with an attempt to fix some problem in the paper.\nOur attempt is partly achieved by showing the existence of universal operator\nunder some additional assumption. It is left as a future task to eliminate this\nassumption. We also see some properties and examples which stimulate further\nresearch. In particular, we show that universal operator has certain nontrivial\nform if it exists.\n", "  Motivated by experiments on ultracold atoms which have realized the Haldane\nmodel for a Chern insulator, we consider its strongly correlated Mott limit\nwith spin-$1/2$ fermions. We find that slave rotor mean field theory yields\ngapped or gapless chiral spin liquid Mott insulators. To study competing\nmagnetic orders, we consider the strong coupling effective spin Hamiltonian\nwhich includes chiral three-spin exchange. We obtain its classical phase\ndiagram, uncovering various chiral magnetic orders including tetrahedral, cone,\nand noncoplanar spiral states which can compete with putative chiral quantum\nspin liquids. We study the effect of thermal fluctuations on these states,\nidentifying crossovers in the spin chirality, and phase transitions associated\nwith lattice symmetry breaking. We also discuss analogous effective spin\nHamiltonians for correlated spin-$1/2$ bosons. Finally, we point out possible\nexperimental implications of our results for cold atom experiments.\n", "  We propose a general method to find exact ground state solutions to the\nSU($N$) invariant matrix model arising from the quantization of the\n11-dimensional supermembrane action in the light-cone gauge. We illustrate the\nmethod by applying it to lower dimensional models and for the SU(2) group. This\napproach can be used to find ground state solutions to the complete\n9-dimensional model and for any SU($N$) group. The supercharges and the\nconstraints related to the SU(2) symmetry are the relevant operators and they\ngenerate a multicomponent wave function. In the procedure, the fermionic\ndegrees of freedom are represented by means of Dirac-like gamma matrices. We\nexhibit a relation between these finite $N$ matrix theory ground state\nsolutions and SUSY quantum cosmology wave functions giving a possible physical\nsignificance to the theory even for finite $N$\n", "  We develop a large scale quantum master equation approach to describe\ndynamical processes of practical open quantum systems driven by both coherent\nand stochastic interactions by including more than one thousand true states of\nthe systems, motivated by the development of highly bright and fully coherent\nlasers in the X-ray wavelength regime. The method combines the processes of\ncoherent dynamics induced by the X-ray laser and incoherent relaxations due to\nspontaneous emissions, Auger decays, and electronic collisions. As examples,\ntheoretical investigation of {\\it real} coherent dynamics of inner-shell\nelectrons of a neon gas, irradiated by a high-intensity X-ray laser with a full\ntemporal coherence, is carried out with the approach. In contrast to the rate\nequation treatment, we find that coherence can suppress the multiphoton\nabsorptions of a neon gas in the ultra-intense X-ray pulse, due to\ncoherence-induced Rabi oscillations and power broadening effects. We study the\ninfluence of coherence on ionization processes of neon, and directly prove that\nsequential single-photon processes for both outer- and inner-shell electrons\ndominate the ionizations for the recently typical experiments with a laser\nintensity of $\\approx10^{18}$ ${\\rm W/cm^2}$. We discuss possible experimental\nimplementations such as signatures for coherent evolution of inner-shell\nelectrons via resonance fluorescence processes. The approach can also be\napplied to many different practical open quantum systems in atomic, quantum\noptical, and cold matter systems, which are treated qualitatively by a\nfew-level master equation model before.\n", "  We use high-resolution N-body simulations to follow the formation and\nevolution of tidal streams associated to dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). The\ndSph models are embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes with either a\ncentrally-divergent 'cusp', or an homogeneous-density 'core'. In agreement with\nprevious studies, we find that as tides strip the galaxy the evolution of the\nhalf-light radius and the averaged velocity dispersion follows well-defined\ntracks that are mainly controlled by the amount of mass lost. Crucially, the\nevolutionary tracks behave differently depending on the shape of the DM\nprofile: at a fixed remnant mass, dSphs embedded in cored haloes have larger\nsizes and higher velocity dispersions than their cuspy counterparts. The\ndivergent evolution is particularly pronounced in galaxies whose stellar\ncomponent is strongly segregated within their DM halo and becomes more\ndisparate as the remnant mass decreases. Our analysis indicates that the DM\nprofile plays an important role in defining the internal dynamics of tidal\nstreams. We find that stellar streams associated to cored DM models have\nvelocity dispersions that lie systematically above their cuspy counterparts.\nOur results suggest that the dynamics of streams with known dSph progenitors\nmay provide strong constraints on the distribution of DM on the smallest\ngalactic scales.\n", "  We discuss the interpretation of the LHC Higgs data and the test of the Higgs\nmechanism. This is done in a more model-independent approach relying on an\neffective Lagrangian, as well as in specific models like composite Higgs models\nand supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. The proper interpretation\nof the data requires the inclusion of higher-order corrections both for the\nrelevant Higgs parameters and the production and decay processes. We review\nrecent results obtained within the Collaborative Research Centre / Transregio 9\n\"Computational Particle Physics\".\n", "  Observations of low-mass stars reveal a variety of magnetic field topologies\nranging from large-scale, axial dipoles to more complex magnetic fields. At the\nsame time, three-dimensional spherical simulations of convectively driven\ndynamos reproduce a similar diversity, which is commonly obtained either with\nBoussinesq models or with more realistic models based on the anelastic\napproximation, which take into account the variation of the density with depth\nthroughout the convection zone. Nevertheless, a conclusion from different\nanelastic studies is that dipolar solutions seem more difficult to obtain as\nsoon as substantial stratifications are considered. In this paper, we aim at\nclarifying this point by investigating in more detail the influence of the\ndensity stratification on dipolar dynamos. To that end, we rely on a systematic\nparameter study that allows us to clearly follow the evolution of the stability\ndomain of the dipolar branch as the density stratification is increased. The\nimpact of the density stratification both on the dynamo onset and the dipole\ncollapse is discussed and compared to previous Boussinesq results. Furthermore,\nour study indicates that the loss of the dipolar branch does not ensue from a\nspecific modification of the dynamo mechanisms related to the background\nstratification, but could instead result from a bias as our observations\nnaturally favour a certain domain in the parameter space characterized by\nmoderate values of the Ekman number, owing to current computational\nlimitations. Moreover, we also show that the critical magnetic Reynolds number\nof the dipolar branch is scarcely modified by the increase of the density\nstratification, which provides an important insight into the global\nunderstanding of the impact of the density stratification on the stability\ndomain of the dipolar dynamo branch.\n", "  We show how the flat spacetime Galileon field theories (FSGFT) in arbitrary\ndimensions can be obtained through a Born-Infeld type structure. This\nconstruction involves a brane metric and non-linear combinations of derivatives\nof a scalar field. Our setup gives rise to some Galileon tensors and vectors\nuseful for the variational analysis which are related to the momentum density\nof the probe Lovelock branes floating in a $N$-dimensional flat bulk. We find\nfurther that the Noether currents associated to these Galileon theories may be\nwritten in terms of such tensors.\n", "  Electromagnetic driving in a honeycomb lattice can induce gaps and\ntopological edge states with a structure of increasing complexity as the\nfrequency of the driving lowers. While the high frequency case is the most\nsimple to analyze we focus on the multiple photon processes allowed in the low\nfrequency regime to unveil the hierarchy of Floquet edge-states. In the case of\nlow intensities an analytical approach allows us to derive effective\nHamiltonians and address the topological character of each gap in a\nconstructive manner. At high intensities we obtain the net number of edge\nstates, given by the winding number, with a numerical calculation of the Chern\nnumbers of each Floquet band. Using these methods, we find a hierarchy that\nresembles that of a Russian nesting doll. This hierarchy classifies the gaps\nand the associated edge states in different orders according to the\nelectron-photon coupling strength. For large driving intensities, we rely on\nthe numerical calculation of the winding number, illustrated in a map of\ntopological phase transitions. The hierarchy unveiled with the low energy\neffective Hamiltonians, alongside with the map of topological phase transitions\ndiscloses the complexity of the Floquet band structure in the low frequency\nregime. The proposed method for obtaining the effective Hamiltonian can be\neasily adapted to other Dirac Hamiltonians of two dimensional materials and\neven the surface of a 3D topological insulator.\n", "  Rectification of microwave oscillations of magnetization in a permalloy film\nis realized using planar Hall effect. Two different rectified signals are\nobtained: a signal from the linearly excited uniform magnetization precession\nat the frequency of the external pumping and a signal from the pairs of\ncontra-propagating short-wavelength spin waves parametrically generated at a\nhalf of the pumping frequency. The second, most unusual, rectified signal is\ncaused by the uniform component of the dynamic magnetization created due to the\ninterference of the phase correlated pairs of parametric spin waves.\n", "  Extending previous work [T. Pusztai, L. R\\'atkai, A. Sz\\'all\\'as, and L.\nGr\\'an\\'asy, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 87}, 032402 (2013)], we have studied the\nformation of eutectic dendrites in a model ternary system within the framework\nof the phase-field theory. We have mapped out the domain in which two-phase\ndendritic structures grow. With increasing pulling velocity, the following\nsequence of growth morphologies is observed: flat front lamellae $\\rightarrow$\neutectic colonies $\\rightarrow$ eutectic dendrites $\\rightarrow$ dendrites with\ntarget pattern $\\rightarrow$ partitionless dendrites $\\rightarrow$\npartitionless flat front. We confirm that the two-phase and one-phase dendrites\nhave similar forms, and display a similar scaling of the dendrite tip radius\nwith the interface free energy. It is also found that the possible eutectic\npatterns include the target pattern, and single- and multiarm spirals, of which\nthe thermal fluctuations choose. The most probable number of spiral arms\nincreases with increasing tip radius and with decreasing kinetic anisotropy.\nOur numerical simulations confirm that in agreement with the assumptions of a\nrecent analysis of two-phase dendrites [S. Akamatsu, S. Bottin-Rousseau, G.\nFaivre, and E. A. Brener, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 112}, 105502 (2014)], the\nJackson-Hunt scaling of the eutectic wavelength with pulling velocity is obeyed\nin the parameter domain explored, and that the natural eutectic wavelength is\nproportional to the tip radius of the two-phase dendrites. Finally, we find\nthat it is very difficult/virtually impossible to form spiraling two-phase\ndendrites without anisotropy, an observation that seems to contradict the\nexpectations of Akamatsu {\\it et al.}. Yet, it cannot be excluded, that in\nisotropic systems two-phase dendrites are rare events difficult to observe in\nsimulations.\n", "  At about 40 km off the coast of Toulon (France), anchored at 2475 m deep in\nthe Mediterranean Sea, there is ANTARES: the first undersea neutrino telescope\nand the only one currently operating. The detector consists of 885\nphotomultiplier tubes arranged into 12 strings of 450-metres high, with the aim\nto detect the Cherenkov light induced by the charged superluminal interaction\nproducts of neutrinos. Its main scientific target is the search for high-energy\n(TeV and beyond) neutrinos from cosmic accelerators, as predicted by hadronic\ninteraction models, and the measurement of the cosmic neutrino diffuse flux,\nfocusing in particular on events coming from below the horizon (up-going\nevents) in order to significantly reduce the atmospheric muons background.\nThanks to the development of a strategy for the identification of neutrinos\ncoming from above the horizon (down-going events) the field of view of the\ntelescope will be extended.\n", "  The new model of phonon transmission across the interface between two\ncrystals is proposed featured by taking into account the mismatch of crystal\nlattices. It has been found that the mismatch of lattices results in phonon\nscattering at the interface even in the absence of defects. As it has been\nshown, at the normal incidence, longitudinally polarized phonons have much\nlarger transmission coefficient than that of transversely polarized phonons,\nexcluding the special resonance cases. For the quasi one-dimensional case the\nexact solution has been obtained.\n", "  The interaction between nuclei and a strong zeptosecond laser pulse with\ncoherent MeV photons is investigated theoretically. We provide a first\nsemi-quantitative study of the quasiadiabatic regime where the photon\nabsorption rate is comparable to the nuclear equilibration rate. In that\nregime, multiple photon absorption leads to the formation of a compound nucleus\nin the so-far unexplored regime of excitation energies several hundred MeV\nabove the yrast line. The temporal dynamics of the process is investigated by\nmeans of a set of master equations that account for dipole absorption,\nstimulated dipole emission, neutron decay and induced fission in a chain of\nnuclei. That set is solved numerically by means of state-of-the-art matrix\nexponential methods also used in nuclear fuel burnup and radioactivity\ntransport calculations. Our quantitative estimates predict the excitation path\nand range of nuclei reached by neutron decay and provide relevant information\nfor the layout of future experiments.\n", "  We present Bill2d, a modern and efficient C++ package for classical\nsimulations of two-dimensional Hamiltonian systems. Bill2d can be used for\nvarious billiard and diffusion problems with one or more charged particles with\ninteractions, different external potentials, an external magnetic field,\nperiodic and open boundaries, etc. The software package can also calculate many\nkey quantities in complex systems such as Poincar\\'e sections, survival\nprobabilities, and diffusion coefficients. While aiming at a large class of\napplicable systems, the code also strives for ease-of-use, efficiency, and\nmodularity for the implementation of additional features. The package comes\nalong with a user guide, a developer's manual, and a documentation of the\napplication program interface (API).\n", "  We consider Yang-Baxter equations arising from its associative analog and\nstudy corresponding exchange relations. They generate finite-dimensional\nquantum algebras which have form of coupled ${\\rm GL}(N)$ Sklyanin elliptic\nalgebras. Then we proceed to a natural generalization of the Baxter-Belavin\nquantum $R$-matrix to the case ${\\rm Mat}(N,\\mathbb C)^{\\otimes 2}\\otimes {\\rm\nMat}(M,\\mathbb C)^{\\otimes 2}$. It can be viewed as symmetric form of ${\\rm\nGL}(NM)$ $R$-matrix in the sense that the Planck constant and the spectral\nparameter enter (almost) symmetrically. Such type (symmetric) $R$-matrices are\nalso shown to satisfy the Yang-Baxter like quadratic and cubic equations.\n", "  It was recently shown that black holes could be bouncing stars as a\nconsequence of quantum gravity. We investigate the astrophysical signals\nimplied by this hypothesis, focusing on primordial black holes. We consider\ndifferent possible bounce times and study the integrated diffuse emission.\n", "  In this article, we study the stability of black hole solutions found in the\ncontext of dilatonic Horava-Lifshitz gravity in $1+1$ dimensions by means of\nthe quasinormal modes approach. In order to find the corresponding quasinormal\nmodes, we consider the perturbations of massive and massless scalar fields\nminimally coupled to gravity. In both cases, we found that the quasinormal\nmodes have a discrete spectrum and are completely imaginary, which leads to\ndamping modes. For a massive scalar field and a non-vanishing cosmological\nconstant, our results suggest unstable behaviour for large values of the scalar\nfield mass.\n", "  We compute the branching ratio and forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$)\ndistribution for the rare dileptonic decay $B \\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ for the full\nrange of $q^2$, the dimuon mass squared, region. For the required form factors,\nwe use nonperturbative inputs as predicted by the anti-de Sitter (AdS)/QCD\ncorrespondence. When using the Breit-Wigner model with momentum-dependent decay\nconstants to account for the $\\psi$ and $\\psi^\\prime$ resonance effects in the\nnonresonance region of the spectrum, we find our predictions to be in better\nagreement with the experimental data for the branching ratio.\n", "  The $Z\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ and $Z\\to gg$ decays are studied in the context of\nthe renormalizable version of the Standard Model Extension. The $CPT$-odd\n$\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma_5 \\gamma^\\mu b_\\mu\\psi$ bilinear interaction, which involves\nthe constant background field $b_\\alpha$ and which has been a subject of\ninterest in literature, is considered. It is shown that the $Z\\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$ and $Z\\to gg$ decays, which are strictly zero in the standard model,\ncan be generated radiatively at the one-loop level. It is found that these\ndecays are gauge invariant and free of ultraviolet divergences, and that the\ncorresponding decay widths only depend on the spatial component of the\nbackground field $b$.\n", "  We extend recent results on expectation values of coherent oscillator states\nand SU(2) coherent states to the case of the discrete representations of\nsu(1,1). Systematic semiclassical expansions of products of arbitrary operators\nare derived. In particular, the leading order of the energy uncertainty of an\narbitrary Hamiltonian is found to be given purely in terms of the time\ndependence of the classical variables. The coherent states considered here\ninclude the Perelomov-Gilmore coherent states. As an important application we\ndiscuss the pseudoharmonic oscillator and compare the Perelomov-Gilmore states\nwith the states introduced by Barut and Girardello. The latter ones turn out to\nbe closer to the classical limit as their relative energy variance decays with\nthe inverse square root of energy, while in the former case a constant is\napproached.\n", "  We report the measurement of longitudinal electron diffusion coefficients in\nliquid argon for electric fields between 100 and 2000 V/cm with a gold\nphotocathode as a bright electron source. The measurement principle, apparatus,\nand data analysis are described. Our results, which are consistent with\nprevious measurements in the region between 100 to 350 V/cm [1] , are\nsystematically higher than the prediction of Atrazhev-Timoshkin[2], and\nrepresent the world's best measurement in the region between 350 to 2000 V/cm.\nThe quantum efficiency of the gold photocathode, the drift velocity and\nlongitudinal diffusion coefficients in gas argon are also presented.\n", "  We embed models of holographic dark energy coupled to dark matter in minimal\nsupergravity plus matter, with one chiral superfield. We analyze two cases. The\nfirst one has the Hubble radius as the infrared cutoff and the interaction\nbetween the two fluids is proportional to the energy density of the dark\nenergy. The second case has the future event horizon as infrared cutoff while\nthe interaction is proportional to the energy density of both components of the\ndark sector.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the half-filling point in lattice QCD\n(LQCD), in particular the disappearance of the sign problem and the emergence\nof an apparent particle-hole symmetry, and try to understand where these\nproperties come from by studying the heavy-dense fermion determinant and the\ncorresponding strong-coupling partition function (which can be integrated\nanalytically). We then add in a first step an effective Polyakov loop gauge\naction (which reproduces the leading terms in the character expansion of the\nWilson gauge action) to the heavy-dense partition function and try to analyze\nhow some of the properties of the half-filling point change when leaving the\nstrong coupling limit. In a second step, we take also the leading\nnearest-neighbor fermion hopping terms into account (including gauge\ninteractions in the fundamental representation) and mention how the method\ncould be improved further to incorporate the full set of nearest-neighbor\nfermion hoppings. Using our mean-field method, we also obtain an approximate\n($\\mu$,T) phase diagram for heavy-dense LQCD at finite inverse gauge coupling\n$\\beta$. Finally, we propose a simple criterion to identify the chemical\npotential beyond which lattice artifacts become dominant.\n", "  Searches for unknown physics and decisions between competing astrophysical\nmodels to explain data both rely on statistical hypothesis testing. The usual\napproach in searches for new physical phenomena is based on the statistical\nLikelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and its asymptotic properties. In the common\nsituation, when neither of the two models under comparison is a special case of\nthe other i.e., when the hypotheses are non-nested, this test is not\napplicable. In astrophysics, this problem occurs when two models that reside in\ndifferent parameter spaces are to be compared. An important example is the\nrecently reported excess emission in astrophysical $\\gamma$-rays and the\nquestion whether its origin is known astrophysics or dark matter. We develop\nand study a new, simple, generally applicable, frequentist method and validate\nits statistical properties using a suite of simulations studies. We exemplify\nit on realistic simulated data of the Fermi-LAT $\\gamma$-ray satellite, where\nnon-nested hypotheses testing appears in the search for particle dark matter.\n", "  Variable-delay Polarization Modulators (VPMs) are currently being implemented\nin experiments designed to measure the polarization of the cosmic microwave\nbackground on large angular scales because of their capability for providing\nrapid, front-end polarization modulation and control over systematic errors.\nDespite the advantages provided by the VPM, it is important to identify and\nmitigate any time-varying effects that leak into the synchronously modulated\ncomponent of the signal. In this paper, the effect of emission from a $300$ K\nVPM on the system performance is considered and addressed. Though instrument\ndesign can greatly reduce the influence of modulated VPM emission, some\nresidual modulated signal is expected. VPM emission is treated in the presence\nof rotational misalignments and temperature variation. Simulations of\ntime-ordered data are used to evaluate the effect of these residual errors on\nthe power spectrum. The analysis and modeling in this paper guides\nexperimentalists on the critical aspects of observations using VPMs as\nfront-end modulators. By implementing the characterizations and controls as\ndescribed, front-end VPM modulation can be very powerful for mitigating $1/f$\nnoise in large angular scale polarimetric surveys. None of the systematic\nerrors studied fundamentally limit the detection and characterization of\nB-modes on large scales for a tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r=0.01$. Indeed,\n$r<0.01$ is achievable with commensurately improved characterizations and\ncontrols.\n", "  We demonstrate universal quantum control over chains of ions in a\nsurface-electrode ion trap, including all the fundamental operations necessary\nto perform algorithms in a one-dimensional, nearest-neighbor quantum computing\narchitecture. We realize both single-qubit operations and nearest-neighbor\nentangling gates with Raman laser beams, and we interleave the two gate types.\nWe report average single-qubit gate fidelities as high as 0.970(1) for two-,\nthree-, and four-ion chains, characterized with randomized benchmarking. We\ngenerate Bell states between the nearest-neighbor pairs of a three-ion chain,\nwith fidelity up to 0.84(2). We combine one- and two-qubit gates to perform\nquantum process tomography of a CNOT gate in a two-ion chain, and we report an\noverall fidelity of 0.76(3).\n", "  The packing of charged micron-sized particles was investigated using discrete\nelement simulations based on adhesive contact dynamic model. The formation\nprocess and the final obtained structures of ballistic packings are studied to\nshow the effect of interparticle Coulomb force. It was found that increasing\nthe charge on particles causes a remarkable decrease of the packing volume\nfraction \\phi and the average coordination number Z, indicating a looser and\nchainlike structure. Force-scaling analysis shows that the long-range Coulomb\ninteraction changes packing structures through its influence on particle\ninertia before they are bonded into the force networks. Once contact networks\nare formed, the expansion effect caused by repulsive Coulomb forces are\ndominated by short-range adhesion. Based on abundant results from simulations,\na dimensionless adhesion parameter Ad* , which combines the effects of the\nparticle inertia, the short-range adhesion and the long-range Coulomb\ninteraction, is proposed and successfully scales the packing results for\nmicron-sized particles within the latestly derived adhesive loose packing (ALP)\nregime. The structural properties of our packings follow well the recent\ntheoretical prediction which is described by an ensemble approach based on a\ncoarse-grained volume function, indicating some kind of universality in the low\npacking density regime of the phase diagram regardless of adhesion or particle\ncharge. Based on the comprehensive consideration of the complicated\ninter-particle interactions, our findings provide insight into the roles of\nshort-range adhesion and repulsive Coulomb force during packing formation and\nshould be useful for further design of packings.\n", "  Recently a variational integrator for ideal magnetohydrodynamics in\nLagrangian labeling has been developed. Its built-in frozen-in equation makes\nit optimal for studying current sheet formation. We use this scheme to study\nthe Hahm-Kulsrud-Taylor problem, which considers the response of a 2D plasma\nmagnetized by a sheared field under sinusoidal boundary forcing. We obtain an\nequilibrium solution that preserves the magnetic topology of the initial field\nexactly, with a fluid mapping that is non-differentiable. Unlike previous\nstudies that examine the current density output, we identify a singular current\nsheet from the fluid mapping. These results are benchmarked with a constrained\nGrad-Shafranov solver. The same signature of current singularity can be found\nin other cases with more complex magnetic topologies.\n", "  The current density ${\\bf j}^{\\rm{\\bf B}}$ induced in a clean metal by a\nslowly-varying magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ is formulated as the low-frequency\nlimit of natural optical activity, or natural gyrotropy. Working with a\nmultiband Pauli Hamiltonian, we obtain from the Kubo formula a simple\nexpression for $\\alpha^{\\rm gme}_{ij}=j^{\\rm{\\bf B}}_i/B_j$ in terms of the\nintrinsic magnetic moment (orbital plus spin) of the Bloch electrons on the\nFermi surface. An alternate semiclassical derivation provides an intuitive\npicture of the effect, and takes into account the influence of scattering\nprocesses in dirty metals. This \"gyrotropic magnetic effect\" is fundamentally\ndifferent from the chiral magnetic effect driven by the chiral anomaly and\ngoverned by the Berry curvature on the Fermi surface, and the two effects are\ncompared for a minimal model of a Weyl semimetal. Like the Berry curvature, the\nintrinsic magnetic moment should be regarded as a basic ingredient in the\nFermi-liquid description of transport in broken-symmetry metals.\n", "  A Markovian open quantum system which relaxes to a unique steady state\n$\\rho_{ss}$ of finite rank can be decomposed into a finite physically\nrealizable ensemble (PRE) of pure states. That is, as shown by Karasik and\nWiseman [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 020406 (2011)], in principle there is a way to\nmonitor the environment so that in the long time limit the conditional state\njumps between a finite number of possible pure states. In this paper we show\nhow to apply this idea to the dynamics of a double quantum dot arising from the\nfeedback control of quantum transport, as previously considered by one of us\nand co-workers [Phys. Rev. B 84, 085302 (2011)]. Specifically, we consider the\nlimit where the system can be described as a qubit, and show that while the\ncontrol scheme can always realize a two-state PRE, in the incoherent tunneling\nregime there are infinitely many PREs compatible with the dynamics that cannot\nbe so realized. For the two-state PREs that are realized, we calculate the\ncounting statistics and see a clear distinction between the coherent and\nincoherent regimes.\n", "  We construct a bulk geometry with Q-lattice structure, which is implemented\nby two gauge fields and a coupling between the lattice and the Maxwell field.\nThis gravity dual model can describe a novel insulator which exhibits some key\nfeatures analogous to Mott insulator. In particular, a hard gap in insulating\nphase as well as vanishing DC conductivity can be simultaneously achieved. In\naddition, we discuss the non-Drude behavior of the optical conductivity in low\nfrequency region in insulating phase, which exhibits some novel characteristics\ndifferent from ordinary Mott insulator.\n", "  When a system is driven across a quantum critical point at a constant rate\nits evolution must become non-adiabatic as the relaxation time $\\tau$ diverges\nat the critical point. According to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), the\nemerging post-transition excited state is characterized by a finite correlation\nlength $\\hat\\xi$ set at the time $\\hat t=\\hat \\tau$ when the critical slowing\ndown makes it impossible for the system to relax to the equilibrium defined by\nchanging parameters. This observation naturally suggests a dynamical scaling\nsimilar to renormalization familiar from the equilibrium critical phenomena. We\nprovide evidence for such KZM-inspired spatiotemporal scaling by investigating\nan exact solution of the transverse field quantum Ising chain in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  This paper describes the algorithms used by the CMS experiment to reconstruct\nand identify tau to hadrons + tau neutrino decays during Run 1 of the LHC. The\nperformance of the algorithms is studied in proton-proton collisions recorded\nat a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The algorithms achieve an identification efficiency\nof 50-60%, with misidentification rates for quark and gluon jets, electrons,\nand muons between per mille and per cent levels.\n", "  We extend the quantum-classical duality to the trigonometric (hyperbolic)\ncase. The duality establishes an explicit relationship between the classical\nN-body trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and the inhomogeneous twisted\nXXZ spin chain on N sites. Similarly to the rational version, the spin chain\ndata fixes a certain Lagrangian submanifold in the phase space of the classical\nintegrable system. The inhomogeneity parameters are equal to the coordinates of\nparticles while the velocities of classical particles are proportional to the\neigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians (residues of the properly normalized\ntransfer matrix). In the rational version of the duality, the action variables\nof the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model are equal to the twist parameters with some\nmultiplicities defined by quantum (occupation) numbers. In contrast to the\nrational version, in the trigonometric case there is a splitting of the\nspectrum of action variables (eigenvalues of the classical Lax matrix). The\nlimit corresponding to the classical Calogero-Sutherland system and quantum\ntrigonometric Gaudin model is also described as well as the XX limit to free\nfermions.\n", "  Cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL) allows characterizing light emission in\nbulk and nanostructured materials and is a key tool in fields ranging from\nmaterials science to nanophotonics. Previously, CL measurements focused on the\nspectral content and angular distribution of emission, while the polarization\nwas not fully determined. Here we demonstrate a technique to access the full\npolarization state of the cathodoluminescence emission, that is the Stokes\nparameters as a function of the emission angle. Using this technique, we\nmeasure the emission of metallic bullseye nanostructures and show that the\nhandedness of the structure as well as nanoscale changes in excitation position\ninduce large changes in polarization ellipticity and helicity. Furthermore, by\nexploiting the ability of polarimetry to distinguish polarized from unpolarized\nlight, we quantify the contributions of different types of coherent and\nincoherent radiation to the emission of a gold surface, silicon and gallium\narsenide bulk semiconductors. This technique paves the way for in-depth\nanalysis of the emission mechanisms of nanostructured devices as well as\nmacroscopic media.\n", "  The coupling between spin and torsion in the Einstein-Cartan-Sciama-Kibble\ntheory of gravity generates gravitational repulsion at very high densities,\nwhich prevents a singularity in a black hole and may create there a new\nuniverse. We show that quantum particle production in such a universe near the\nlast bounce, which represents the Big Bang gives the dynamics that solves the\nhorizon, flatness, and homogeneity problems in cosmology. For a particular\nrange of the particle production coefficient, we obtain a nearly constant\nHubble parameter that gives an exponential expansion of the universe with more\nthan 60 $e$-folds, which lasts about $\\sim 10^{-42}$ s. This scenario can thus\nexplain cosmic inflation without requiring a fundamental scalar field and\nreheating. From the obtained time dependence of the scale factor, we follow the\nprescription of Ellis and Madsen to reconstruct in a non-parametric way a\nscalar field potential which gives the same dynamics of the early universe.\nThis potential gives the slow-roll parameters of cosmic inflation, from which\nwe calculate the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the scalar spectral index of density\nperturbations, and its running as functions of the production coefficient. We\nfind that these quantities do not significantly depend on the scale factor at\nthe Big Bounce. Our predictions for these quantities are consistent with the\nPlanck 2015 observations.\n", "  Even simple inflationary scenarios have many free parameters. Beyond the\nvariables appearing in the inflationary action, these include dynamical initial\nconditions, the number of fields, and couplings to other sectors. These\nquantities are often ignored but cosmological observables can depend on the\nunknown parameters. We use Bayesian networks to account for a large set of\ninflationary parameters, deriving generative models for the primordial spectra\nthat are conditioned on a hierarchical set of prior probabilities describing\nthe initial conditions, reheating physics, and other free parameters. We use\n$N_f$--quadratic inflation as an illustrative example, finding that the number\nof $e$-folds $N_*$ between horizon exit for the pivot scale and the end of\ninflation is typically the most important parameter, even when the number of\nfields, their masses and initial conditions are unknown, along with possible\nconditional dependencies between these parameters.\n", "  We study the R\\'enyi entanglement entropy and the Shannon mutual information\nfor a class of spin-1/2 quantum critical XXZ chains with random coupling\nconstants which are partially correlated. In the XX case, distinctly from the\nusual uncorrelated random case where the system is governed by an\ninfinite-disorder fixed point, the correlated-disorder chain is governed by\nfinite-disorder fixed points. Surprisingly, we verify that, although the system\nis not conformally invariant, the leading behavior of the R\\'enyi entanglement\nentropies are similar to those of the clean (no randomness) conformally\ninvariant system. In addition, we compute the Shannon mutual information among\nsubsystems of our correlated-disorder quantum chain and verify the same leading\nbehavior as the $n=2$ R\\'enyi entanglement entropy. This result extends a\nrecent conjecture concerning the same universal behavior of these quantities\nfor conformally invariant quantum chains. For the generic spin-1/2 quantum\ncritical XXZ case, the true asymptotic regime is identical to that in the\nuncorrelated disorder case. However, these finite-disorder fixed points govern\nthe low-energy physics up to a very long crossover length scale and the same\nresults as in the XX case apply. Our results are based on exact numerical\ncalculations and on a numerical strong-disorder renormalization group.\n", "  Which song will Smith listen to next? Which restaurant will Alice go to\ntomorrow? Which product will John click next? These applications have in common\nthe prediction of user trajectories that are in a constant state of flux over a\nhidden network (e.g. website links, geographic location). What users are doing\nnow may be unrelated to what they will be doing in an hour from now. Mindful of\nthese challenges we propose TribeFlow, a method designed to cope with the\ncomplex challenges of learning personalized predictive models of\nnon-stationary, transient, and time-heterogeneous user trajectories. TribeFlow\nis a general method that can perform next product recommendation, next song\nrecommendation, next location prediction, and general arbitrary-length user\ntrajectory prediction without domain-specific knowledge. TribeFlow is more\naccurate and up to 413x faster than top competitors.\n", "  Using an optically-trapped mixture of the two lowest hyperfine states of a\n$^6$Li Fermi gas, we observe two-field optical tuning of the narrow Feshbach\nresonance by up to 3 G and an increase in spontaneous lifetime near the broad\nresonance from $0.5$ ms to $0.4$ s. We present a new model of light-induced\nloss spectra, employing continuum-dressed basis states, that agrees in shape\nand magnitude with measurements for both broad and narrow resonances.\n", "  We present the results of a search for long-duration gravitational wave\ntransients in two sets of data collected by the LIGO Hanford and LIGO\nLivingston detectors between November 5, 2005 and September 30, 2007, and July\n7, 2009 and October 20, 2010, with a total observational time of 283.0 days and\n132.9 days, respectively. The search targets gravitational wave transients of\nduration 10 - 500 s in a frequency band of 40 - 1000 Hz, with minimal\nassumptions about the signal waveform, polarization, source direction, or time\nof occurrence. All candidate triggers were consistent with the expected\nbackground; as a result we set 90% confidence upper limits on the rate of\nlong-duration gravitational wave transients for different types of\ngravitational wave signals. For signals from black hole accretion disk\ninstabilities, we set upper limits on the source rate density between $3.4\n\\times 10^{-5}$ - $9.4 \\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at 90% confidence.\nThese are the first results from an all-sky search for unmodeled long-duration\ntransient gravitational waves.\n", "  The $a_1(1420)$ with $I^G(J^{PC})= 1^-(1^{++})$ observed in the $\\pi^+\nf_0(980)$ final state in the $\\pi^-p\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^- p$ process by the\nCOMPASS collaboration seems unlikely to be an ordinary $\\bar qq$ mesonic state.\nAvailable theoretical explanations include tetraquark or rescattering effects\ndue to $a_1(1260)$ decays. If the $a_1(1420)$ were induced by the rescattering,\nits production rates are completely determined by those of the $a_1(1260)$. In\nthis work, we propose to explore the ratios of branching fractions of heavy\nmeson weak decays into the $a_1(1420)$ and $a_1(1260)$, and testing the\nuniversality of these ratios would be a straightforward way to\nvalidate/invalidate the rescattering explanation. The decay modes include in\nthe charm sector the $D^0\\to a_1^-\\ell^+\\nu$ and $D^0\\to \\pi^\\pm a_1^\\mp$, and\nin the bottom sector $\\overline B^0\\to a_1^+ \\ell^- \\bar\\nu$, $B\\to D a_1,\n\\pi^\\pm a_1^\\mp$, $B_c\\to J/\\psi a_1$ and $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda_c a_1$. We\ncalculate the branching ratios for various decay modes into the $a_1(1260)$.\nThe numerical results indicate that there is a promising prospect to study\nthese decays on experiments including BES-III, LHCb, Babar, Belle and CLEO-c,\nthe forthcoming Super-KEKB factory and the under-design Circular\nElectron-Positron Collider. Experimental analyses in future will lead to a\ndeeper understanding of the nature of the $a_1(1420)$.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of NOAA Active Region 11817 during 2013 August\n10--12, when it developed a complex field configuration and produced four\nconfined, followed by two eruptive, flares. These C-and-above flares are all\nassociated with a magnetic flux rope (MFR) located along the major polarity\ninversion line, where shearing and converging photospheric flows are present.\nAided by the nonlinear force-free field modeling, we identify the MFR through\nmapping magnetic connectivities and computing the twist number $\\mathcal{T}_w$\nfor each individual field line. The MFR is moderately twisted ($|\\mathcal{T}_w|\n< 2$) and has a well-defined boundary of high squashing factor $Q$. We found\nthat the field line with the extremum $|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ is a reliable proxy of\nthe rope axis, and that the MFR's peak $|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ temporarily increases\nwithin half an hour before each flare while it decreases after the flare peak\nfor both confined and eruptive flares. This pre-flare increase in\n$|\\mathcal{T}_w|$ has little effect on the active region's free magnetic energy\nor any other parameters derived for the whole region, due to its moderate\namount and the MFR's relatively small volume, while its decrease after flares\nis clearly associated with the stepwise decrease in free magnetic energy due to\nthe flare. We suggest that $\\mathcal{T}_w$ may serve as a useful parameter in\nforewarning the onset of eruption, and therefore, the consequent space weather\neffects. The helical kink instability is identified as the prime candidate\nonset mechanism for the considered flares.\n", "  A useful simplification of the quasilocalizded charge approximations (QLCA)\nmethod to calculate the dispersion relations in strongly coupled Yukawa fluids\nis discussed. In this simplified version, a simplest possible model radial\ndistribution function, properly related to the thermodynamic properties of the\nsystem, is used. The approach demonstrates good agreement with the dispersion\nrelations obtained using the molecular dynamics simulations and the original\nQLCA in the long-wavelength regime.\n", "  Recently a new high energy proton microscopy facility PRIOR (Proton\nMicroscope for FAIR) has been designed, constructed and successfully\ncommissioned at GSI Helmholtzzentrum f\\\"ur Schwerionenforschung (Darmstadt,\nGermany). As a result of the experiments with 3.5-4.5 GeV proton beams\ndelivered by the heavy ion synchrotron SIS-18 of GSI, 30 um spatial and 10 ns\ntemporal resolutions of the proton microscope have been demostrated. A new\npulsed power setup for studying properties of matter under extremes has been\ndeveloped for the dynamic commissioning of the PRIOR facility. This paper\ndescribes the PRIOR setup as well as the results of the first static and\ndynamic proton radiography experiments performed at GSI.\n", "  The problem of quantum state discrimination, which is a foundational aspect\nof quantum information theory, and its relation to the theory of majorization\nare discussed. The purpose of this study is to review different approaches to\nthe problem and analyze different cases of quantum-state discrimination, most\nimportantly the discrimination of bipartite entangled quantum states under\nlocal operations and classical communication. Two partial results on using\nentanglement as a resource for quantum-state discrimination and discrimination\nwith remaining entanglement is given. The important points are also summarized\nand the results are discussed.\n", "  The description of the modifications of the coherence pattern in a parton\nshower, in the presence of a QGP, has been actively addressed in recent\nstudies. Among the several achievements, finite energy corrections, transverse\nmomentum broadening due to medium interactions and interference effects between\nsuccessive emissions have been extensively improved as they seem to be\nessential features for a correct description of the results obtained in\nheavy-ion collisions. In this work, based on the insights of our previous work\n[1], we explore the physical interplay between broadening and decoherence, by\ngeneralising previous studies of medium-modifications of the antenna spectrum\n[2, 3, 4] - so far restricted to the case where transverse motion is neglected.\nThe result allow us to identify two quantities controlling the decoherence of a\nmedium modified shower that can be used as building blocks for a successful\nfuture generation of jet quenching Monte Carlo simulators: a generalisation of\nthe $\\Delta_{med}$ parameter of the works of [2, 4] - that controls the\ninterplay between the transverse scale of the hard probe and the transverse\nresolution of the medium - and of the $\\Delta_{coh}$ in [1] - that dictates the\ninterferences between two emitters as a function of the transverse momentum\nbroadening acquired by multiple scatterings with the medium.\n", "  If a magnetar interior $B$-field exceeds $10^{15}$~G, it will unpair the\nproton superconductor in the stellar core by inducing diamagnetic currents that\ndestroy the Cooper pair coherence. Then, the $P$-wave neutron superfluid in\nthese non-superconducting regions will couple to the stellar plasma by\nscattering of protons off the quasiparticles that are confined in the cores of\nneutron vortices by the strong (nuclear) force. The dynamical timescales\nassociated with this interaction span from several minutes at the crust-core\ninterface to a few seconds in the deep core. We show that (a) the rapid\ncrust-core coupling is incompatible with oscillation models of magnetars that\ncompletely decouple the core superfluid from the crust and (b) magnetar\nprecession is damped by the coupling of normal fluids to the superfluid core\nand, if observed, needs to be forced or continuously excited by seismic\nactivity.\n", "  We study a generic model for quorum-sensing bacteria in circular confinement.\nEvery bacterium produces signaling molecules, the local concentration of which\ntriggers a response when a certain threshold is reached. If this response\nlowers the motility then an aggregation of bacteria occurs, which differs\nfundamentally from standard motility-induced phase separation due to the\nlong-ranged nature of the concentration of signal molecules. We analyze this\nphenomenon analytically and by numerical simulations employing two different\nprotocols leading to stationary cluster and ring morphologies, respectively.\n", "  This paper presents the principles and application of a super-resolution (SR)\ntechnique, based on a L1-Norm minimization procedure. In particular, the\ntechnique is applied to improve low-resolution resolution spectra as obtained\nfrom the optogalvanic effect in Neon and Argon discharges over the 413-423 nm\nwavelength range. By applying the super-resolution algorithm to the\nexperimental data, a surprising 70-fold reduction of the linewidth is achieved\nallowing to resolve prior indistinguishable peaks. It is found that further\nimprovements on the resolution are limited by the signal to noise ratio of the\noriginal spectra. The importance of a suitable mathematical representation of\nthe experiment and the discussion on other applications of this\nsuper-resolution technique in spectroscopy are also presented.\n", "  We constructed a $^3$He magnetic force microscope operating at the base\ntemperature of 300 mK under a vector magnetic field of 2-2-9 T in the $x-y-z$\ndirection. Fiber optic interferometry as a detection scheme is employed in\nwhich two home-built fiber walkers are used for the alignment between the\ncantilever and the optical fiber. The noise level of the laser interferometer\nis close to its thermodynamic limit. The capabilities of the sub-Kelvin and\nvector field are demonstrated by imaging the coexistence of magnetism and\nsuperconductivity in a ferromagnetic superconductor (ErNi$_2$B$_2$C) at $T$=500\nmK and by probing a dipole shape of a single Abrikosov vortex with an in-plane\ntip magnetization.\n", "  Taking [math/0606786] as an inspiration, we study the intrinsic torsion of a\nSU(2) structure manifold in six dimensions to give a formula for the Ricci\nscalar in terms of torsion classes. The derivation is founded on the SU(3)\nresult coming from the aforementioned paper.\n", "  The excess seen in the diphoton channel at around 750 GeV by both ATLAS and\nCMS has caused a great deal of excitement in the particle physics community.\nHowever, there has recently been much discussion about uncertainties in the\nsignificance of the peak seen by the ATLAS experiment. In this note, we aim to\nestimate this significance using a range of possible parametrisations for the\nsmooth diphoton background. We obtain a local significance close to that\nreported by ATLAS and further demonstrate that the significance of the excess\nis not substantially reduced when more complicated background functions are\nconsidered. In particular, the background contribution is strongly constrained\nby the small numbers of events at large diphoton invariant mass. Future data\nreleases will improve constraints on the diphoton background, as well as\nclarifying the true nature of the 750 GeV excess.\n", "  We present a comparative study of the unfilled CoSb3 and FeSb3 skutterudites\nand report on their compressibility studied by high-pressure synchrotron X-ray\ndiffraction. The equation of state for FeSb3 was received for the first time.\nThe third order Birch- Murnaghan isothermal equations of state were fitted to\nthe experimental data in the pressure ranges atm-34 GPa for CoSb3 and atm-14\nGPa for FeSb3. Bulk moduli of 95(5) GPa and 86(4) GPa have been obtained for\nCoSb3 and FeSb3, respectively. The bulk modulus of FeSb3 is in a contrast by\nabout 30% with literature value obtained indirectly. Anomaly was observed in\nthe diffraction pattern of CoSb3 at the pressures 34.4-39.6 GPa which is most\nprobably reasoned by structure transition.\n", "  The concept of nestedness, in particular for ecological and economical\nnetworks, has been introduced as a structural characteristic of real\ninteracting systems. We suggest that the nestedness is in fact another way to\nexpress a mesoscale network property called the core-periphery structure. With\nreal ecological mutualistic networks and synthetic model networks, we reveal\nthe strong correlation between the nestedness and core-periphery-ness (likeness\nto the core-periphery structure), by defining the network-level measures for\nnestedness and core-periphery-ness in the case of weighted and bipartite\nnetworks. However, at the same time, via more sophisticated null-model\nanalysis, we also discover that the degree (the number of connected neighbors\nof a node) distribution poses quite severe restrictions on the possible\nnestedness and core-periphery parameter space. Therefore, there must exist\nstructurally interwoven properties in more fundamental levels of network\nformation, behind this seemingly obvious relation between nestedness and\ncore-periphery structures.\n", "  We present a twist expansion of differential cross-sections of the forward\nDrell-Yan process at the high energies. The expansion of all invariant\nform-factors is performed assuming GBW saturation model and the saturation\nscale plays the role of the hadronic scale of OPE. Some expilicit predictions\nfor LHC experiments are given. It is shown also how the Lam-Tung relation is\nbroken at twist 4 what provides a sensitive probe for searching of higher\ntwists.\n", "  We present numerical and analytical results for the lifetime of emitters in\nclose proximity to graphene sheets. Specifically, we analyze the contributions\nfrom different physical channels that participate in the decay processes. Our\nresults demonstrate that measuring the emitters' decay rates provides an\nefficient route for sensing graphene's optoelectronic properties, notably the\nexistence and size of a potential band gap in its electronic band structure.\n", "  We investigate light dark matter production associated with a heavy\nquarkonium at B factories in a model-independent way by adopting the effective\nfield theory approach for the interaction of dark matter with standard model\nparticles. We consider the effective operators for the dark matter-heavy quark\ninteraction, which are relevant to the production of dark matter associated\nwith a heavy quarkonium. We calculate the cross sections for dark matter\nproduction associated with a J/psi or eta_c to compare with the standard model\nbackgrounds. We set bounds on the energy scale of new physics for various\neffective operators and also obtain the corresponding limits for the dark\nmatter-nucleon scattering cross sections for light dark matter with mass of the\norder of a few GeV.\n", "  Real-world social and/or operational networks consist of agents with\nassociated states, whose connectivity forms complex topologies. This complexity\nis further compounded by interconnected information layers, consisting, for\ninstance, documents/resources of the agents which mutually share topical\nsimilarities. Our goal in this work is to predict the specific states of the\nagents, as their observed resources evolve in time and get updated. The\ninformation diffusion among the agents and the publications themselves\neffectively result in a dynamic process which we capture by an interconnected\nsystem of networks (i.e. layered). More specifically, we use a notion of a\nsupra-Laplacian matrix to address such a generalized diffusion of an\ninterconnected network starting with the classical \"graph Laplacian\". The\nauxiliary and external input update is modeled by a multidimensional Brownian\nprocess, yielding two contributions to the variations in the states of the\nagents: one that is due to the intrinsic interactions in the network system,\nand the other due to the external inputs or innovations. A variation on this\ntheme, a priori knowledge of a fraction of the agents' states is shown to lead\nto a Kalman predictor problem. This helps us refine the predicted states\nexploiting the error in estimating the states of agents. Three real-world\ndatasets are used to evaluate and validate the information diffusion process in\nthis novel layered network approach. Our results demonstrate a lower prediction\nerror when using the interconnected network rather than the single connectivity\nlayer between the agents. The prediction error is further improved by using the\nestimated diffusion connection and by applying the Kalman approach with partial\nobservations.\n", "  Compact silicon integrated devices, such as micro-ring resonators, have\nrecently been demonstrated as efficient sources of quantum correlated photon\npairs. The mass production of integrated devices demands the implementation of\nfast and reliable techniques to monitor the device performances. In the case of\ntime-energy correlations, this is particularly challenging, as it requires high\nspectral resolution that is not currently achievable in coincidence\nmeasurements. Here we reconstruct the joint spectral density of photons pairs\ngenerated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon ring resonator by\nstudying the corresponding stimulated process, namely stimulated four wave\nmixing. We show that this approach, featuring high spectral resolution and\nshort measurement times, allows one to discriminate between nearly-uncorrelated\nand highly-correlated photon pairs.\n", "  The properties of the relative abundances of rapid and slow neutron-capture\nelements are studied using a catalog containing spectroscopic abundance\ndeterminations for 14~elements produced in various nuclear-synthesis processes\nfor 90~open clusters. The catalog also contains the positions, ages,\nvelocities, and elements of the Galactic orbits of the clusters. The relative\nabundances of both $r$-elements (Eu) and $s$-elements (Y, Ba, La, and Ce) in\nclusters with high, elongated orbits and in field stars of the Galactic thin\ndisk display different dependences on metallicity, age, Galactocentric\ndistance, and the elements of the Galactic orbits, supporting the view that\nthese objects have different natures. In young clusters, not only barium, but\nalso the three other studied $s$-elements display significantly higher relative\nabundances than field stars of the same metallicity. The relative abundances of\nEu are lower in high-metallicity clusters (${\\rm [Fe/H]} > -0.1$) with high,\nelongated orbits than in field giants, on average, while the [Eu/Fe] ratios in\nlower-metallicity clusters are the same as those in field stars, on average,\nalthough with a large scatter. The metallicity dependence of the [O, Mg/Eu]\nratios in clusters with high, elongated orbits and in field stars are\nsubstantially different. These and other described properties of the Eu\nabundances, together with the properties of the abundances of primary\n$\\alpha$-elements, can be understood in a natural way if clusters with high,\nelongated orbits with different metallicities formed as a result of\ninteractions of two types of high-velocity clouds with the interstellar medium\nof the Galactic disk: low-metallicity high-velocity clouds that formed from\n\"primordial\" gas, and high-metallicity clouds with intermediate velocities that\nformed in \"Galactic fountains\".\n", "  In this paper, we try to consider the stability conditions of a modified\ngravity coupled by Weyl tensor. In this way, we indicate the suitable\nconditions for a successful bounce while the equation of state (EoS) parameter\ncrosses the phantom divider for our new corrected modified gravity. In the\nspatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe,\naccording to the ordinary version of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model,\ndescribing accelerated expansion of the universe, will be considered. Our\nmodel's stability conditions and its general properties of attractors for\nscalar field scripts which control cosmological acceleration will be checked.\nThe statefinder diagnostic parameters of our model will be compared by today's\nobservational data and defined methods. However its EoS parameter will be\nobtained, too.\n", "  This paper focuses on the next detectors for gravitational wave astronomy\nwhich will be required after the current ground based detectors have completed\ntheir initial observations, and probably achieved the first direct detection of\ngravitational waves. The next detectors will need to have greater sensitivity,\nwhile also enabling the world array of detectors to have improved angular\nresolution to allow localisation of signal sources. Sect. 1 of this paper\nbegins by reviewing proposals for the next ground based detectors, and presents\nan analysis of the sensitivity of an 8 km armlength detector, which is proposed\nas a safe and cost-effective means to attain a 4-fold improvement in\nsensitivity. The scientific benefits of creating a pair of such detectors in\nChina and Australia is emphasised. Sect. 2 of this paper discusses the high\nperformance suspension systems for test masses that will be an essential\ncomponent for future detectors, while sect. 3 discusses solutions to the\nproblem of Newtonian noise which arise from fluctuations in gravity gradient\nforces acting on test masses. Such gravitational perturbations cannot be\nshielded, and set limits to low frequency sensitivity unless measured and\nsuppressed. Sects. 4 and 5 address critical operational technologies that will\nbe ongoing issues in future detectors. Sect. 4 addresses the design of thermal\ncompensation systems needed in all high optical power interferometers operating\nat room temperature. Parametric instability control is addressed in sect. 5.\nOnly recently proven to occur in Advanced LIGO, parametric instability\nphenomenon brings both risks and opportunities for future detectors. The path\nto future enhancements of detectors will come from quantum measurement\ntechnologies. Sect. 6 focuses on the use of optomechanical devices for\nobtaining enhanced sensitivity, while sect. 7 reviews a range of quantum\nmeasurement options.\n", "  We show the equality between macroscopic and microscopic black hole entropy\nfor a class of four dimensional non-supersymmetric black holes in ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupergravity theory, up to the first subleading order in their charges. This\nsolves a long standing entropy puzzle for this class of black holes. The\nmacroscopic entropy has been computed in the presence of a newly derived\nhigher-derivative supersymmetric invariant of \\cite{{Butter:2013lta}},\nconnected to the five dimensional supersymmetric Weyl squared Lagrangian.\nMicroscopically, the crucial role in obtaining the equivalence is played by the\nanomalous gauge gravitational Chern-Simons term.\n", "  Blazars are active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointed at the\nEarth, making them extremely bright at essentially all wavelengths, from radio\nto gamma rays. I review the modeling of this broadband spectral energy\ndistributions of these objects, and what we have learned, with a focus on gamma\nrays.\n", "  We show that Jordan-Lie-Banach algebras, which provide an abstract\ncharacterization of quantum theory equivalent to C^* algebras, can always be\ncanonically represented in terms of smooth functions on a K\\\"ahler manifold.\n", "  Recent epidemiological evidences indicate that arsenic exposure increases\nrisk of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases and microangiopathies in\naddition to the serious global health concern related to its carcinogenic\neffects. In experiments on animals, acute and chronic exposure to arsenic\ndirectly correlates cardiac tachyarrhythmia, and atherogenesis in a\nconcentration and duration dependent manner. Moreover, the other effects of\nlong-term arsenic exposure include induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes\nby mechanisms yet to be understood. On the other hand, there are controversial\nissues, gaps in knowledge, and future research priorities of accelerated\nincidences of CVD and mortalities in patients with HIV who are under long-term\nanti-retroviral therapy (ART). Although, both HIV infection itself and various\ncomponents of ART initiate significant pathological alterations in the\nmyocardium and the vasculature, simultaneous environmental exposure to arsenic\nwhich is more convincingly being recognized as a facilitator of HIV viral\ncycling in the infected immune cells, may contribute an additional layer of\nadversity in these patients. In this mini-review which have been fortified with\nour own preliminary data, we will discuss some of the key current understating\nof chronic arsenic exposure, and its possible impact on the accelerated HIV/ART\ninduced CVD. The review will conclude with notes on recent developments in\nmathematical modeling in this field that probabilistically forecast incidence\nprevalence as functions of aging and life style parameters, most of which vary\nwith time themselves; this interdisciplinary approach provides a complementary\nkernel to conventional biology.\n", "  $E_8$ is prominent in mathematics and theoretical physics, and is generally\nviewed as an exceptional symmetry in an eight-dimensional space very different\nfrom the space we inhabit; for instance the Lie group $E_8$ features heavily in\nten-dimensional superstring theory. Contrary to that point of view, here we\nshow that the $E_8$ root system can in fact be constructed from the icosahedron\nalone and can thus be viewed purely in terms of three-dimensional geometry. The\n$240$ roots of $E_8$ arise in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D space as a double\ncover of the $120$ elements of the icosahedral group, generated by the root\nsystem $H_3$. As a by-product, by restricting to even products of root vectors\n(spinors) in the 4D even subalgebra of the Clifford algebra, one can show that\neach 3D root system induces a root system in 4D, which turn out to also be\nexactly the exceptional 4D root systems. The spinorial point of view explains\ntheir existence as well as their unusual automorphism groups. This spinorial\napproach thus in fact allows one to construct all exceptional root systems\nwithin the geometry of three dimensions, which opens up a novel interpretation\nof these phenomena in terms of spinorial geometry.\n", "  We report the flux measurement of the Vela like pulsar B1800-21 at the low\nradio frequency regime over multiple epochs spanning several years. The\nspectrum shows a turnover around the GHz frequency range and represents a\ntypical example of gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) pulsar. Our observations\nrevealed that the pulsar spectrum show a significant evolution during the\nobserving period with the low frequency part of the spectrum becoming steeper,\nwith a higher turnover frequency, for a period of several years before\nreverting back to the initial shape during the latest measurements. The\nspectral change over times spanning several years requires dense structures,\nwith free electron densities around 1000--20000 cm$^{-3}$ and physical\ndimensions ~220 AU, in the interstellar medium (ISM) traversing across the\npulsar line of sight. We look into the possible sites of such structures in the\nISM and likely mechanisms particularly the thermal free-free absorption as\npossible explanations for the change.\n", "  In this paper, we make the case that Clifford algebra is the natural\nframework for root systems and reflection groups, as well as related groups\nsuch as the conformal and modular groups: The metric that exists on these\nspaces can always be used to construct the corresponding Clifford algebra. Via\nthe Cartan-Dieudonn\\'e theorem all the transformations of interest can be\nwritten as products of reflections and thus via `sandwiching' with Clifford\nalgebra multivectors. These multivector groups can be used to perform concrete\ncalculations in different groups, e.g. the various types of polyhedral groups,\nand we treat the example of the tetrahedral group $A_3$ in detail. As an aside,\nthis gives a constructive result that induces from every 3D root system a root\nsystem in dimension four, which hinges on the facts that the group of spinors\nprovides a double cover of the rotations, the space of 3D spinors has a 4D\neuclidean inner product, and with respect to this inner product the group of\nspinors can be shown to be closed under reflections. In particular the 4D root\nsystems/Coxeter groups induced in this way are precisely the exceptional ones,\nwith the 3D spinorial point of view also explaining their unusual automorphism\ngroups. This construction simplifies Arnold's trinities and puts the McKay\ncorrespondence into a wider framework. We finally discuss extending the\nconformal geometric algebra approach to the 2D conformal and modular groups,\nwhich could have interesting novel applications in conformal field theory,\nstring theory and modular form theory.\n", "  The observed magnetic tunability of light transmission through a ferrofluid\ncan be effectively understood in terms of the inter-particle interaction that\ncan be estimated from the magnetic and rheological properties of these fluids.\nThe present study reports complementary magnetic and rheological measurements\nof aqueous dispersions of ferrite nanoparticles and a commercial ferrofluid.\nThe room temperature magnetization measured in a SQUID magnetometer up to\nfields of 1 to 2 Tesla showed superparamagnetic behaviour of the particles and\nthe dispersion with the background signal of the liquid showing a diamagnetic\nbehaviour. The room temperature rheological behaviour in zero magnetic field of\nthe fluids was investigated by measuring the viscosity as a function of shear\nrate from 1-100 s-1. The particle size and the nature of the carrier liquid\ndetermine the viscosity and is expected to have an effect on the inter-particle\ninteraction.\n", "  Strong field photoelectron holography has been proposed as a means for\ninterrogating the spatial and temporal information of electrons and ions in a\ndynamic system. After ionization, part of the electron wave packet may directly\ngo to the detector (the reference wave), while another part may be driven back\nto the ion where it scatters off (the signal wave). The interference hologram\nof the two waves may be used to retrieve the target information. However,\nunlike conventional optical holography, the propagations of electron wave\npackets are affected by the Coulomb potential as well as by the laser field. In\naddition, electrons are emitted over the whole laser pulse duration, thus\nmultiple interferences may occur. In this work, we used a generalized\nquantum-trajectory Monte Carlo method to investigate the effect of Coulomb\npotential and the nonadiabatic subcycle ionization on the photoelectron\nhologram. We showed that photoelectron hologram can be well described only when\nthe nonadiabatic effect in ionization is accounted for, and Coulomb potential\ncan be neglected only in the tunnel ionization regime. Our results help\nestablishing photoelectron holography for probing spatial and dynamic\nproperties of atoms and molecules.\n", "  Charge-changing transitions, commonly referred to as Gamow-Teller (GT)\ntransitions, and electron capture/$\\beta^{+}$-decay strengths for pf-shell\nnuclei with $T_{z} = - 2$ at proton drip-line have been calculated using the\nproton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) model. The\ntotal GT$_{+}$ strength values and electron capture/$\\beta^{+}$-decay rates are\nneeded for the study of the late stages of the stellar evolution. The pn-QRPA\ntheory is used for a microscopic calculation of GT strength distribution\nfunctions and associated stellar electron capture/$\\beta^{+}$-decay rates of\nproton-rich pf-shell nuclei with $T_{z} = - 2$ in the mass range 46 $\\leq$ A\n$\\leq$ 56 at proton drip-line. Standard quenching factor of 0.74, usually\nimplemented in the shell model calculation, has been incorporated for the\ncomparison with experimental data (wherever available). The calculated GT\nstrength of the two proton-rich nuclei, $^{52}$Ni and $^{56}$Zn are compared\nwith experimental data of corresponding mirror nuclei. It has been found that\nthe pn-QRPA results are in good agreement with the experimental data as well as\nshell model result. It is noted that the total GT strength increases linearly\nwith the increase of mass number. The electron capture/$\\beta^{+}$-decay rates\nfor proton-rich nuclei are calculated on a temperature and density scale\nrelevant to presupernova evolution of massive stars. The $\\beta^{+}$ decay\nhalf-lives are compared with measured and other theoretical calculations.\n", "  While adhesion reduction due to roughness is not surprising, roughness\ninduced adhesion remained a puzzle until recently Guduru and coworkers have\nshown a very convincing mechanism to explain both the increase of strength and\nof toughness in a sphere with concentric single scale of waviness. Kesari and\ncoworkers have later shown some very elegant convenient asymptotic expansion of\nGuduru's solution. This enhancement is very high and indeed, using Kesari's\nsolution, it is here shown to depend uniquely on a Johnson parameter for\nadhesion of a sinusoidal contact. However, counterintuitively, it leads to\nunbounded enhancement for conditions of large roughness for which Johnson\nparameter is very low. Guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur\nafter sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact.\nAlso, that although the enhancement is limited to the JKR regime of large soft\nmaterials with high adhesion, the DMT limit for the smooth sphere is found\notherwise. However, for hard materials, even the DMT limit for the smooth\nsolids is very hard to observe, which suggest that also adhesion reduction is\nyet not well understood.\n  The limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further\ndiscussed, and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough\nplanes due to Rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase\nis predicted, orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid\nsolids. We suggest that Guduru's model may be close to an upper bound to\nadhesion of rough bodies, while the Rumpf-Rabinovich model may be close to a\nlower bound.\n", "  The study of spacetime, and its role in understanding functional systems has\nreceived little attention in information science. Recent work, on the origin of\nuniversal scaling in cities and biological systems, provides an intriguing\ninsight into the functional use of space, and its measurable effects. Cities\nare large information systems, with many similarities to other technological\ninfrastructures, so the results shed new light indirectly on the scaling the\nexpected behaviour of smart pervasive infrastructures and the communities that\nmake use of them.\n  Using promise theory, I derive and extend the scaling laws for cities to\nexpose what may be extrapolated to technological systems. From the promise\nmodel, I propose an explanation for some anomalous exponents in the original\nwork, and discuss what changes may be expected due to technological\nadvancement.\n", "  We present an analytical model to investigate the mechanics of 2-dimensional\nlattices composed of elastic beams of non-uniform cross-section. Our approach\nis based on reducing a lattice to a single beam subject to the action of a set\nof linear and torsional springs, thus allowing the problem to be solved through\na transfer matrix method. We show a non-trivial region of design space that\nyields materials with auxetic properties for strains greater than that required\nto trigger elastic instability. The critical loading required to make this\ntransition from positive to negative Poisson's ratio is calculated.\nFurthermore, we present lattice parameters that provide direction-dependent\ndeformation modes offering great tailorability of the mechanical properties of\nfinite size lattices. Not only is our analytical formulation in good agreement\nwith the finite element simulation results, but it provides an insight into the\nrole of the interplay between structure and elastic instability, and gives an\nefficient methodology to pursue questions of rational design in the field of\nmechanical metamaterials.\n", "  This problem was given on the Open Experimental Physics Olympiad (OEPO) \"The\nday of the photon\" on 25 April 2015. The Olympiad was a part of the celebration\nof the International Year of Light (IYL)\nhttp://www.light2015.org/Home/Event-Programme/2015/Competition/Bulgaria-Second-Experimental-Physics-Olympiad--25-April-2015-in-Sofia.-The-Day-of-the-Photon-in-the-International-Year-of-the-Light.html\nand was organized by the Sofia Branch of the Union of Physicist in Bulgaria and\nthe Regional Society of Physicists of Strumica, Macedonia.\n", "  The non-extensive statistical mechanics has been used to describe a variety\nof complex systems. The maximization of entropy, often used to introduce the\nnon-extensive statistical mechanics, is a formal procedure and does not easily\nleads to physical insight. In this article we investigate the canonical\nensemble in the non-extensive statistical mechanics by considering a small\nsystem interacting with a large reservoir via short-range forces and assuming\nequal probabilities for all available microstates. We concentrate on the\nsituation when the reservoir is characterized by generalized entropy with\nnon-extensivity parameter q>1. We also investigate the problem of divergence in\nthe non-extensive statistical mechanics occurring when q>1 and show that there\nis a limit on the growth of the number of microstates of the system that is\ngiven by the same expression for all values of q.\n", "  The mechanism of threshold elongation (overstretching) of DNA macromolecules\nunder the action of external force is studied within the framework of\nphenomenological approach. When considering the task it is taken into account\nthat double-stranded DNA is a polymorphic macromolecule with a set of\nmetastable states. Accordingly to proposed mechanism, DNA threshold elongation\ncan take place as a cooperative structural transition of macromolecule to\nmetastable form, which is stabilized by the external force. For the description\nof DNA overstretching, the model included external (stretching) and internal\n(conformation) displacement components is constructed. As assumed, both\ncomponents are coupled on the pathway of double helix transformations. It is\nshown, that under force action DNA deformation proceeds in two stages. First\none is the restructuring of the double helix, which leads to formation of\nconformational bistability in DNA macromolecule. On the second stage, the\nconformational transition and the deformation induced by it consistently cover\nthe macromolecule as a threshold process. The comparison of calculated\ncharacteristics of DNA overstretching process with experimental data shows good\nagreement. Analysis of the results obtained, together with the available\nliterature data allow to conclude, that overstretching transition in the double\nhelix is dynamical process and can spread in DNA chain. In the same time, in\nDNA with A$\\cdot$T-rich content due to large dissipation the overstretching\nprocess leads to force induced melting transition, and should have nearly\nstatic character.\n", "  A first step toward a multi-scale and multi-physic model --a virtual\nmaterial-- for self-healing ceramic matrix composites is presented. Each\nmechanism --mechanical, chemical-- that act on the material's lifetime at a\ngiven scale --fibre, yarn-- is introduced in a single modeling framework, aimed\nat providing powerful prediction tools.\n", "  A first version of a multi-scale, multi-physic hybrid model --called virtual\nmaterial-- for predictions on Self-Healing Ceramic Matrix Composite's (CMCs)\nlifetime is presented. The model has a mechanical and a chemical part, which\nare presented here in their actual state of development. The mechanical part\nprovides precise data for the chemical models through an hybrid --melting\ncontinuum damage macro model discrete crack surfaces-- representation of the\nmorphology of the crack network at yarn scale. The chemical part should provide\npredictions on the structure's lifetime using a model of the self-healing\nprocess, not yet achieved then not presented here, and a model of fiber\nsub-critical failure under mechanical and chemical load.\n", "  Computational modeling can provide critical insight into existing and\npotential new surgical procedures, medical or minimally-invasive treatments for\nheart failure, one of the leading causes of deaths in the world that has\nreached epidemic proportions. In this paper, we present our\nAbaqus/Standard-based pipeline to create subject-specific left ventricular\nmodels. We first review our generic left ventricular model, and then the\npersonalization process based on magnetic resonance images. Identification of\nsubject-specific cardiac material properties is done by coupling\nAbaqus/Standard to the python optimization library NL-Opt. Compared to previous\nstudies from our group, the emphasis is here on the fully implicit solving of\nthe model, and the two-parameter optimization of the passive cardiac material\nproperties.\n", "  We have developed and evaluated a Quantum Interactive Learning Tutorial\n(QuILT) on a Mach-Zehnder Interferometer with single photons to expose\nupper-level students in quantum mechanics courses to contemporary quantum\noptics applications. The QuILT strives to help students develop the ability to\napply fundamental quantum principles to physical situations in quantum optics\nand explore the differences between classical and quantum ideas. The QuILT\nadapts visualization tools to help students build physical intuition about\ncounter-intuitive quantum optics phenomena with single photons including a\nquantum eraser setup and focuses on helping them integrate qualitative and\nquantitative understanding. We discuss findings from in-class evaluations.\n", "  Development of conceptual multiple-choice tests related to a particular\nphysics topic is important for designing research-based learning tools to\nreduce the difficulties. We explore the difficulties that the advanced\nundergraduate and graduate students have with non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics of one particle in one spatial dimension. We developed a\nresearch-based conceptual multiple-choice survey that targets these issues to\nobtain information about the common difficulties and administered it to more\nthan a hundred students from seven different institutions. The issues targeted\nin the survey include the set of possible wavefunctions, bound and scattering\nstates, quantum measurement, expectation values, the role of the Hamiltonian,\ntime-dependence of wavefunction and time-dependence of expectation value. We\nfind that the advanced undergraduate and graduate students have many common\ndifficulties with these concepts and that research-based tutorials and\npeer-instruction tools can significantly reduce these difficulties. The survey\ncan be administered to assess the effectiveness of various intructional\nstrategies.\n", "  This paper is devoted to establish semiclassical Weyl formulae for the Robin\nLaplacian on smooth domains in any dimension. Theirs proofs are reminiscent of\nthe Born-Oppenheimer method.\n", "  We propose a simple mechanism to facilitate the buying and selling of useful,\nbluntly honest information. The for-profit, arm's length knowledge exchange\nthis mechanism enables may dramatically increase the pace of scientific\nprogress.\n", "  An effective method for the quantitative description of the electronic\nexcited states of polyatomic systems is developed by using computer technology.\nThe proposed method allows calculating various properties of matter at the\natomic level within the uniform scheme. A special attention is paid to the\ndescription of beryllium atoms interactions with the external fields,\ncomparable by power to the fields in atoms, molecules and clusters.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental and computational results that show a\nmotility-induced clustering transition in self-propelled particle systems, we\nstudy an individual model and its corresponding Self-Organized Hydrodynamic\nmodel for collective behaviour that incorporates a density-dependent velocity,\nas well as inter-particle alignment. The modal analysis of the hydrodynamic\nmodel elucidates the relationship between the stability of the equilibria and\nthe changing velocity, and the formation of clusters. We find, in agreement\nwith earlier results for non-aligning particles, that the key criterion for\nstability is $(\\rho v(\\rho))'> 0$, i.e. a non-rapid decrease of velocity with\ndensity. Numerical simulation for both the individual and hydrodynamic models\nwith a velocity function inspired by experiment demonstrates the validity of\nthe theoretical results.\n", "  The TOTEM experiment at the LHC has measured proton-proton elastic scattering\nin dedicated runs at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV centre-of-mass LHC energies. The\nproton-proton total cross-section $\\sigma_{\\rm tot}$ has been derived for both\nenergies using a luminosity independent method. TOTEM has excluded a purely\nexponential differential cross-section for elastic proton-proton scattering\nwith significance greater than 7$\\sigma$ in the $|t|$ range from 0.027 to 0.2\nGeV$^{2}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV.\n", "  Social media are transforming global communication and coordination and\nprovide unprecedented opportunities for studying socio-technical domains. Here\nwe study global dynamical patterns of communication on Twitter across many\nscales. Underlying the observed patterns is both the diurnal rotation of the\nearth, day and night, and the synchrony required for contingency of actions\nbetween individuals. We find that urban areas show a cyclic contraction and\nexpansion that resembles heartbeats linked to social rather than natural\ncycles. Different urban areas have characteristic signatures of daily\ncollective activities. We show that the differences detected are consistent\nwith a new emergent global synchrony that couples behavior in distant regions\nacross the world. Although local synchrony is the major force that shapes the\ncollective behavior in cities, a larger-scale synchronization is beginning to\noccur.\n", "  Theoretical and experimental results for in-plane vibrations of a uniform\nrectangular plate with free boundary conditions are obtained. The experimental\nsetup uses electromagnetic-acoustic transducers and a vector network analyzer.\nThe theoretical calculations were obtained using the plane wave expansion\nmethod applied to the in-plane thin plate vibration theory. The agreement\nbetween theory and experiment is excellent for the lower 95 modes covering a\nvery wide frequency range from DC to 20 kHz. Some measured normal-mode wave\namplitudes were compared with the theoretical predictions; very good agreement\nwas observed. The excellent agreement of the classical theory of in-plane\nvibrations confirms its reliability up to very high frequencies.\n", "  Use of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) as an ion source for sensitive\nchemical analysis is uncommon because barrier discharges generate excess noise\ndue to spatial and temporal instability. This design uses contacted, crossed\nglass-coated micro-wires to focus the field into a gradually vanishing gap,\nsuppressing spatial and temporal variability, reducing pressure, temperature,\nand humidity effects, stabilizing discharge initiation and limiting chemical\nfragmentation. Positive-ion-mode proton transfer, chemical fragmentation from a\nmicro-discharge, and NO+ adducts combine to allow broad chemical sensitivity.\nWe analyze noise properties of the ion source and report chemical responsivity\nfor a wide range of volatile organic compounds. Source noise spectral density\nis compared for three systems: the contacted coated wires source, a gapped\ndielectric barrier discharge source, and a 5 mCi Ni-63 radioactive source. The\ncrossed-wires source shows noise properties approaching those of the\nwhite-noise Ni-63 source, while gapped discharge exhibits 1/f noise from\narea-discharge random path and intensity variations. For chemical sensitivity\ntesting, dilute samples are delivered by vapor flow injection or by gas\nchromatography, and then detected by differential ion mobility spectrometry\n(DMS / FAIMS) and, in a few cases by mass spectrometry. The compounds tested in\npositive ion mode include ketones and alcohols, simple aromatics (benzene,\ntoluene, xylenes, ethyl and propyl benzene), chlorinated and nitrated solvents\nand aliphatics (hexanes and n-octane), with sensitivities from ppt to ppb\nlevels. The wires source for trace vapor detection is stable under a range of\nenvironmental conditions from very low (ppb) humidity levels upward, has wider\nchemical coverage than the radioactive nickel source with nearly equivalent\nnoise properties, and is adjustable to higher intensity.\n", "  We investigate the control landscapes of closed, finite level quantum systems\nbeyond the dipole approximation by including a polarizability term in the\nHamiltonian. Theoretical analysis is presented for the $n$ level case and\nformulas for singular controls, which are candidates for landscape traps, are\ncompared to their analogues in the dipole approximation. A numerical analysis\nof the existence of traps in control landscapes beyond the dipole approximation\nis made in the four level case. A numerical exploration of these control\nlandscapes is achieved by generating many random Hamiltonians which include a\nterm quadratic in a single control field. The landscapes of such systems are\nfound numerically to be trap free in general. This extends a great body of\nrecent work on typical landscapes of quantum systems where the dipole\napproximation is made. We further investigate the relationship between the\nmagnitude of the polarizability and the magnitude of the controls resulting\nfrom optimization. It is shown numerically that including a polarizability term\nin an otherwise uncontrollable system removes traps from the landscapes of a\nspecific family of systems by restoring controllability. We numerically assess\nthe effect of a random polarizability term on the know example of a three level\nsystem with a second order trap in its control landscape. It is found that the\naddition of polarizability removes the trap from the landscape. The\nimplications for laboratory control are discussed.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon in $F(R)$\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity in equilibrium and non-equilibrium ensembles. We\nshow that the second law of thermodynamics can be satisfied in this non\nrelativistic theory.\n", "  The paper presents a metaphysical characterization of spatiotemporal\nbackgrounds from a realist perspective. The conceptual analysis is based on a\nheuristic sketch that encompasses the common formal traits of the major\nspacetime theories, such as Newtonian mechanics and general relativity. It is\nshown how this framework can be interpreted in a fully realist fashion, and\nwhat is the role of background structures in such a picture. In the end it is\nargued that, although backgrounds are a source of metaphysical discomfort,\nstill they make a spacetime theory easy to interpret. It is also suggested that\nthis conclusion partially explains why the notion of background independence\ncarries a lot of conceptual difficulties.\n", "  We study models with heavy exotics that account for the LHC $750$ GeV\ndiphoton excess in light of current vector-like quark bounds. Utilizing only\nexotics that may appear in three-stack and four-stack D-brane models, we show\nthat a narrow width diphoton excess can be accounted for while evading existing\nbounds if multiple exotics are added, with vector-like leptons of mass\n$M_L\\lesssim 375$ GeV and vector-like quarks with masses up to $\\simeq 3$ TeV.\nHowever, a large width $(\\Gamma/M \\sim 0.06)$, as suggested by the ATLAS data,\ncannot be easily accommodated in this framework. Renormalization group\nequations with GUT-scale boundary conditions show that these supersymmetric\nmodels are perturbative and stable. Type IIA compactifications on toroidal\norbifolds allow for $O(10)$ Yukawa couplings in the ultraviolet.\n", "  We present experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic levitation of\nhydrogen gas bubble surrounded by liquid hydrogen confined in a\nsemi-transparent spherical shell of 3 mm internal diameter. Such shells are\nused as targets for the inertial confinement fusion (ICF), for which a\nhomogeneous (within a few percent) layer of a hydrogen isotope should be\ndeposited on the internal walls of the shells. The gravity does not allow the\nhydrogen layer thickness to be homogeneous. To compensate this gravity effect,\nwe have used a non-homogeneous magnetic field created by a 10 T superconductive\nsolenoid. Our experiments show that the magnetic levitation homogenizes the\nthickness of liquid hydrogen layer. However, the variation of the layer\nthickness is very difficult to measure experimentally. Our theoretical model\nallows the exact shape of the layer to be predicted. The model takes into\naccount the surface tension, gravity, van der Waals, and magnetic forces. The\nnumerical calculation shows that the homogeneity of the layer thickness is\nsatisfactory for the ICF purposes.\n", "  We introduce a new approach to the study of operational theories of physics\nusing category theory. We define a generalisation of the (causal)\noperational-probabilistic theories of Chiribella et al. and establish their\ncorrespondence with our new notion of an operational category. Our work is\nbased on effectus theory, a recently developed area of categorical logic, to\nwhich we give an operational interpretation, demonstrating its relevance to the\nmodelling of general probabilistic theories.\n", "  In the framework of the thermodynamic approach Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire\n(LGD) combined with the equations of electrostatics, we investigated the effect\nof polarization surface screening on finite size effects of the phase diagrams,\npolar and dielectric properties of ferroelectric nanoparticles of different\nshapes. We obtained and analyzed the analytical results for the dependences of\nthe ferroelectric phase transition temperature, critical size, spontaneous\npolarization and thermodynamic coercive field on the shape and size of\nnanoparticles. The pronounced size effect of these characteristics on the\nscaling parameter, the ratio of the particle characteristic size to the length\nof the surface screening, was revealed. Also our modeling predicts a\nsignificant impact of the flexo-chemical effect (that is a joint action of\nflexoelectric effect and chemical pressure) on the temperature of phase\ntransition, polar and dielectric properties of nanoparticles when their\nchemical composition deviates from the stoichiometric one. We showed on the\nexample of the stoichiometric nanosized and fine SrBi2Ta2O9 particles that\nexcept the vicinity of the critical size, where the system splitting into\ndomains has an important role, results of analytical calculation of the\nspontaneous polarization have little difference from the numerical ones. We\nrevealed a strong impact of the flexo-chemical effect on the phase transition\ntemperature, polar and dielectric properties of SryBi2+xTa2O9 nanoparticles\nwhen the ratio Sr/Bi deviates from the stoichiometric value of 0.5 from 0.35 to\n0.65. From the analysis of experimental data we derived the parameters of the\ntheory, namely coefficients of expansion of the LGD functional, contribution of\nflexo-chemical effect and the length of the surface screening.\n"]}
