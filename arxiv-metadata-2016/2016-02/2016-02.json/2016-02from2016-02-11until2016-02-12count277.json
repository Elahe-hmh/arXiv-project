responsible for the formation of the capillary blood\nvessel network. We describe a system of endothelial cells by means of\ntwo-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations of point-like particles. Cells'\nmotion is governed by the gradient of the concentration of a chemical substance\nthat they produce (chemotaxis). The typical time of degradation of the chemical\nsubstance introduces a characteristic length in the system. We show that\npoint-like model cells form network resembling structures tuned by this\ncharacteristic length, before collapsing altogether. Successively, we improve\nthe non-realistic point-like model cells by introducing an isotropic strong\nrepulsive force between them and a velocity dependent force mimicking the\nobserved peculiarity of endothelial cells to preserve the direction of their\nmotion (persistence). This more realistic model does not show a clear network\nformation. We ascribe this partial fault in reproducing the experiments to the\nstatic geometry of our model cells that, in reality, change their shapes by\nelongating toward neighboring cells.\n", "  The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) glitch group is part of the LIGO\ndetector characterization effort. It consists of data analysts and detector\nexperts who, during and after science runs, collaborate for a better\nunderstanding of noise transients in the detectors. Goals of the glitch group\nduring the fifth LIGO science run (S5) included (1) offline assessment of the\ndetector data quality, with focus on noise transients, (2) veto recommendations\nfor astrophysical analysis and (3) feedback to the commissioning team on\nanomalies seen in gravitational wave and auxiliary data channels. Other\nactivities included the study of auto-correlation of triggers from burst\nsearches, stationarity of the detector noise and veto studies. The group\nidentified causes for several noise transients that triggered false alarms in\nthe gravitational wave searches; the times of such transients were identified\nand vetoed from the data generating the LSC astrophysical results.\n", "  We rigorously prove the existence of directed transport for a certain class\nof ac-driven nonlinear one dimensional systems, namely the generation of\ntransport with a preferred direction in the absence of a net driving force.\n", "  The aim of this topical article is to outline the fundamental ideas\nunderlying the recently developed Fractional Analytic Perturbation Theory\n(FAPT) of QCD and present its main calculational tools together with key\napplications. For this, it is first necessary to review previous methods to\napply QCD perturbation theory at low spacelike momentum scales, where the\ninfluence of the Landau singularities becomes inevitable. Several concepts are\nconsidered and their limitations are pointed out. The usefulness of FAPT is\ndiscussed in terms of two characteristic hadronic quantities: the\nperturbatively calculable part of the pion's electromagnetic form factor in the\nspacelike region and the Higgs-boson decay into a $b\\bar b$ pair in the\ntimelike region. In the first case, the focus is on the optimization of the\nprediction with respect to the choice of the renormalization scheme and the\ndependence on the renormalization and the factorization scales. The second case\nserves to show that the application of FAPT to this reaction reaches already at\nthe four-loop level an accuracy of the order of 1%, avoiding difficulties\ninherent in the standard perturbative expansion. The obtained results are\ncompared with estimates from fixed-order and contour-improved QCD perturbation\ntheory. Using the brand-new Higgs mass value of about 125 GeV, measured at the\nLarge Hadron Collider (CERN), a prediction for $\\Gamma_{H\\to b\\bar{b}}=2.4 \\pm\n0.15 {\\rm MeV}$ is extracted.\n", "  The interaction between a superconducting phase qubit and the two-level\nsystems locating inside the Josephson tunnel barrier is shown to be described\nby the XY model, which is naturally used to implement the iSWAP gate. With this\ngate, we propose a scheme to efficiently generate genuine multi-qubit entangled\nstates of such two-level systems, including multipartite W state and cluster\nstates. In particularly, we show that, with the help of the phase qubit, the\nentanglement witness can be used to efficiently detect the produced genuine\nmulti-qubit entangled states. Furthermore, we analyze that the proposed\napproach for generating multi-qubit entangled states can be used in a wide\nclass of candidates for quantum computation.\n", "  We study the motion of a classical point body of mass M, moving under the\naction of a constant force of intensity E and immersed in a Vlasov fluid of\nfree particles, interacting with the body via a bounded short range potential\nPsi. We prove that if its initial velocity is large enough then the body\nescapes to infinity increasing its speed without any bound \"runaway effect\".\nMoreover, the body asymptotically reaches a uniformly accelerated motion with\nacceleration E/M. We then discuss at a heuristic level the case in which Psi(r)\ndiverges at short distances like g r^{-a}, g,a>0, by showing that the runaway\neffect still occurs if a<2.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes system on a flat cylinder with the\nusual Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity field u. We formulate the\nproblem as an infinite system of ODE's for the natural Fourier components of\nthe vorticity, and the boundary conditions are taken into account by adding a\nvorticity production at the boundary. We prove equivalence to the original\nNavier-Stokes system and show that the decay of the Fourier modes is\nexponential for any positive time in the periodic direction, but it is only\npower-like in the other direction.\n", "  Static axisymmetric thin-shell wormholes are constructed within the framework\nof the Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theory of gravity. Examples of wormholes\nassociated with vacuum and electromagnetic fields are studied. All\nconstructions must be threaded by exotic matter, except in the case of\ngeometries with a singularity of finite radius, associated with an electric\nfield, which can have a throat supported by ordinary matter. These results are\nachieved with any of the two definitions of the flare-out condition considered.\n", "  Quantum non-locality based on the well-known Bell inequality is of kinematic\nnature. A different type of quantum non-locality, the non-locality of the\nquantum equation of motion, is recently put forward with connection to the\nAharonov-Bohm effect [Nature Phys. 6, 151 (2010)]. Evolution of the\ndisplacement operator provides an example to manifest such dynamic quantum\nnon-locality. We propose an experiment using single-atom interferometry to test\nsuch dynamic quantum non-locality. We show how to measure evolution of the\ndisplacement operator with clod atoms in a spin-dependent optical lattice\npotential and discuss signature to identify dynamic quantum non-locality under\na realistic experimental setting.\n", "  Based on the rapid experimental developments of circuit QED, we propose a\nfeasible scheme to simulate a spin-boson model with the superconducting\ncircuits, which can be used to detect quantum Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase\ntransition. We design the spin-boson model by using a superconducting phase\nqubit coupled with a semi-infinite transmission line, which is regarded as\nbosonic reservoir with a continuum spectrum. By tuning the bias current or the\ncoupling capacitance, the quantum KT transition can be directly detected\nthrough tomography measurement on the states of the phase qubit. We also\nestimate the experimental parameters using numerical renormalization group\nmethod.\n", "  Hidden symmetry transformations of D-dimensional vacuum metrics with D-3\ncommuting Killing vectors are studied. We solve directly the Einstein equations\nin the Maison formulation under additional assumptions. We relate the\n4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution to a particular case of the\n5-dimensional Gross-Perry metric.\n", "  We consider the van der Waals' free energy functional, with a scaling small\nparameter epsilon, in the plane domain given by the first quadrant, and\ninhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The boundary data are chosen in\nsuch a way that the interface between the pure phases tends to be horizontal\nand is pinned at some point on the y-axis which approaches zero as epsilon\nconverges to zero. We show that there exists a critical scaling for the pinning\npoint, such that, as the small parameter epsilon tends to zero, the competing\neffects of repulsion from the boundary and penalization of gradients play a\nrole in determining the optimal shape of the (properly rescaled) interface.\nThis result is achieved by means of an asymptotic development of the free\nenergy functional. As a consequence, such analysis is not restricted to\nminimizers but also encodes the asymptotic probability of fluctuations.\n", "  A strategy is proposed to realize robust transport in time reversal invariant\nphotonic system. Using numerical simulation and microwave experiment, we\ndemonstrate that a chiral guided mode in the channel of a three-dimensional\ndielectric woodpile photonic crystal is immune to the scattering of a square\npatch of metal or dielectric inserted to block the channel. The chirality based\nrobust transport can be realized in nonmagnetic dielectric materials without\nany external field.\n", "  We consider a very general dilaton-axion system coupled to Einstein-Hilbert\ngravity in arbitrary dimension and we carry out holographic renormalization for\nany dimension up to and including five dimensions. This is achieved by\ndeveloping a new systematic algorithm for iteratively solving the radial\nHamilton-Jacobi equation in a derivative expansion. The boundary term derived\nis valid not only for asymptotically AdS backgrounds, but also for more general\nasymptotics, including non-conformal branes and Improved Holographic QCD. In\nthe second half of the paper, we apply the general result to Improved\nHolographic QCD with arbitrary dilaton potential. In particular, we derive the\ngeneralized Fefferman-Graham asymptotic expansions and provide a proof of the\nholographic Ward identities.\n", "  We study a classical, noncommutative (NC), Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\ncosmological model. The spatial sections may have positive, negative or zero\nconstant curvatures. The matter content is a generic perfect fluid. The initial\nnoncommutativity between some canonical variables is rewritten, such that, we\nend up with commutative variables and a NC parameter. Initially, we derive the\nscale factor dynamic equations for the general situation, without specifying\nthe perfect fluid or the curvature of the spatial sections. Next, we consider\ntwo concrete situations: a radiation perfect fluid and dust. We study all\npossible scale factor behaviors, for both cases. We compare them with the\ncorresponding commutative cases and one with the other. We obtain, some cases,\nwhere the NC model predicts a scale factor expansion which may describe the\npresent expansion of our Universe. Those cases are not present in the\ncorresponding commutative models. Finally, we compare our model with another NC\nmodel, where the noncommutativity is between different canonical variables. We\nshow that, in general, it leads to a scale factor behavior that is different\nfrom our model.\n", "  Static spherically symmetric black holes and particle like solutions with\nself interacting minimally coupled scalar field {\\phi} are analyzed. They are\nasymptotically flat or anti-de Sitter (AdS). We express them in terms of a\nsingle function {\\rho} which undergoes simple conditions. If {\\phi} is\nnontrivial the ADM mass M has to be positive. No-hair theorems are generalized\nto the AdS asymptotic. For both asymptotics the Killing horizon is\nnondegenerate and its radius cannot be bigger than 2M. Derivatives of {\\rho} at\nsingularity determine properties of admissible potentials V({\\phi}) as\nregularity, boundedness and behaviour for maximal values of {\\phi}. Several\nclasses of solutions with singular or nonsingular potentials are obtained.\nTheir examples are presented in a form of plots.\n", "  Recently a substantial part of globular cluster population has been\nestablished as GeV gamma-ray sources by the Fermi-LAT telescope. We investigate\npossible production of the high energy gamma-rays by relativistic electrons\ninjected from the population of fast rotating, magnetized White Dwarfs within\nthe globular cluster. These electrons comptonize the radiation field within the\nglobular cluster. We conclude that gamma-rays produced by electrons accelerated\nby the whole population of White Dwarfs within a specific cluster are on the\nlevel of detectability of the future Cherenkov telescope array provided that a\nfew thousand of magnetized White Dwarfs have been created uniformly during the\nlifetime of the globular cluster.\n", "  In 1962 Dyson used a physically based, macroscopic argument to deduce the\nfirst two terms of the large spacing asymptotic expansion of the gap\nprobability for the bulk state of random matrix ensembles with symmetry\nparameter \\beta. In the ensuing years, the question of asymptotic expansions of\nspacing distributions in random matrix theory has shown itself to have a rich\nmathematical content. As well as presenting the main known formulas, we give an\naccount of the mathematical methods used for their proofs, and provide some new\nformulas. We also provide a high precision numerical computation of one of the\nspacing probabilities to illustrate the accuracy of the corresponding\nasymptotics.\n", "  Intriguing sub-TeV tails in the pulsed $\\gamma$-ray emission from the Crab\npulsar have been recently discovered by the MAGIC and VERITAS Collaborations.\nThey were not clearly predicted by any pulsar model. It is at present argued\nthat this emission is produced by electrons in the Inverse Compton process\noccurring either in the outer gap of the pulsar magnetosphere or in the pulsar\nwind region at some distance from the light cylinder. We analyse another\nscenario which is consistent with the basic features of this enigmatic\nemission. It is proposed that this emission is caused by electrons accelerated\nvery close to the light cylinder where the $e^\\pm$ plasma can not saturate\ninduced huge electric fields. Electrons reach energies sufficient for\nproduction of hard $\\gamma$-ray spectra in the curvature radiation process. Due\nto different curvature radii of the leading and trailing magnetic field lines,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray spectra from separate pulses should extend to different\nmaximum energies. The scenario can also explain the lower level $\\gamma$-ray\nemission from the interpulse region (between P1 and P2) observed in the Crab\npulsar light curve. Moreover, we argue that pulsars with parameters close to\nthe Vela pulsar should also show pulsed emission with the cut-off at clearly\nlower energies ($\\sim$50 GeV) than that observed in the case of the Crab\npulsar. On the other hand, such tail emission is not expected in pulsars with\nparameters close to the Geminga pulsar. The model also predicts the tail\n$\\gamma$-ray emission extending up to $\\sim$50 GeV from some millisecond\npulsars with extreme parameters such as PSR J0218+4243 and PSR J1823-3021A.\n", "  The long term time evolution of tidal dwarf satellite galaxies with two\ndifferent initial densities orbiting a host galaxy that resembles the Milky Way\nhas been studied using a large set of Newtonian N-Body simulations. From the\nsimulations two maps of the orbital conditions that lead to quasi-equilibrium\nobjects were constructed. It has been found that several orbits of the\nsatellites allow for the existence, for about 1 Gyr or more, of\nout-of-equilibrium bodies with high apparent mass-to-light ratios. Within this\nframework the satellites in the quasi-stable phase reproduce the observed\nsatellite properties for about 16% of the orbit for high density progenitors,\nand for about 66% for progenitors with lower densities An additional simulation\nfor a single satellite with initial mass of 10^7 Msun and Plummer radius of\n0.15 kpc leads to remnants in the quasi- equilibrium phase that simultaneously\nreproduce remarkably well the observational quantities of the UFDGs of the\nMilky Way. This satellite in the quasi-stable phase reproduces the observed\nsatellite properties for about 42% of the orbit. The results suggest that a\nfraction of the observed satellites could plausibly be galaxies without dark\nmatter that have true M/L ratios much lower than those measured. The inflated\nM/L ratios arise because they are observed at the right time, along the right\norbit and during the quasi-equilibrium phase of their evolution. This is a\nviable explanation for the high M/L ratios observed in all satellites as long\nas the satellites are preferentially on certain orbits and are observed at\ncertain times. This could arise within the TDG scenario if all satellites are\ncreated at the same time along a few specific orbits that are particularly\nsusceptible to the quasi-equilibrium phase.\n", "  This is the second of a series of papers in which we introduce and study a\nrigorous \"simplicial\" realization of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons path integral\nfor manifolds M of the form M = Sigma x S1 and arbitrary simply-connected\ncompact structure groups G. More precisely, we introduce, for general links L\nin M, a rigorous simplicial version WLO_{rig}(L) of the corresponding Wilson\nloop observable WLO(L) in the so-called \"torus gauge\" by Blau and Thompson\n(Nucl. Phys. B408(2):345-390, 1993). For a simple class of links L we then\nevaluate WLO_{rig}(L) explicitly in a non-perturbative way, finding agreement\nwith Turaev's shadow invariant |L|.\n", "  In a previous work [J. Math. Phys. {\\bf 35} (1994), 2539--2551], generalized\nhypergeometric functions have been used to a give a rigorous derivation of the\nlarge $s$ asymptotic form of the general $\\beta > 0$ gap probability\n$E_\\beta^{\\rm hard}(0;(0,s);\\beta a/2)$, provided both $\\beta a /2 \\in \\mathbb\nZ_\\ge 0$ and $2/\\beta \\in \\mathbb Z^+$. It shown how the details of this method\ncan be extended to remove the requirement that $2/\\beta \\in \\mathbb Z^+$.\nFurthermore, a large deviation formula for the gap probability\n$E_\\beta(n;(0,x);{\\rm ME}_{\\beta,N}(\\lambda^{a \\beta /2} e^{\\beta N\n\\lambda/2}))$ is deduced by writing it in terms of the charateristic function\nof a certain linear statistic. By scaling $x = s/(4N)^2$ and taking $N \\to\n\\infty$, this is shown to reproduce a recent conjectured formula for\n$E_\\beta^{\\rm hard}(n;(0,s);\\beta a/2)$, $\\beta a /2 \\in \\mathbb Z_{\\ge 0}$,\nand moreover to give a prediction without the latter restriction. This extended\nformula, which for the constant term involves the Barnes double gamma function,\nis shown to satisfy an asymptotic functional equation relating the gap\nprobability with parameters $(\\beta,n,a)$, to a gap probability with parameters\n$(4/\\beta,n',a')$, where $n'=\\beta(n+1)/2-1$, $a'=\\beta(a-2)/2+2$.\n", "  We study the evolution of possible progenitors of Sgr dSph}using several\nnumerical N-body simulations of different dwarf spheroidal galaxies both with\nand without dark matter, as they orbit the Milky Way. The barionic and dark\ncomponents of the dwarfs were made obeying a Plummer and NFW potentials of one\nmillion particles respectively. The Milky Way was modeled like a tree-component\nrigid potential and the simulations were performed using a modified Gadget-2\ncode. We found that none of the simulated galaxies without dark matter\nreproduced the physical properties observed in Sgr dSph, suggesting that, at\nthe beginning of its evolution, Sgr dSph might have been immersed in a dark\nmatter halo.\n  The simulations of progenitors immersed in dark matter halos suggest that Sgr\ndSph at its beginning might have been an extended system, i.e. its Plummer\nradius could have had a value approximated to 1.2 kpc or higher; furthermore,\nthis galaxy could have been immersed in a dark halo with a mass higher than\n10^8 solar masses. These results are important for the construction of a model\nof the formation of Sgr dSph.\n", "  We investigate from the fractal viewpoint the way in which the dark matter is\ngrouped at z = 0 in the Millennium dark matter cosmological simulation. The\ndetermination of the cross to homogeneity in the Millennium Simulation data is\ndescribed from the behaviour of the fractal dimension and the lacunarity. We\nuse the sliding window technique to calculate the fractal mass-radius\ndimension, the pre-factor F and the lacunarity of this fractal relation.\nBesides, we determinate the multi-fractal dimension and the lacunarity\nspectrum, including their dependence with radial distance. This calculations\nshow a radial distance dependency of all the fractal quantities, with\nheterogeneity clustering of dark matter haloes up to depths of 100 Mpc/h. The\ndark matter haloes clustering in the Millennium Simulation shows a radial\ndistance dependency, with two regions clearly defined. The lacunarity spectrum\nfor values of the structure parameter q >= 1 shows regions with relative\nmaxima, revealing the formation of clusters and voids in the dark matter haloes\ndistribution. With the use of the multi-fractal dimension and the lacunarity\nspectrum, the transition to homogeneity at depths between 100 Mpc/h and 120\nMpc/h for the Millennium Simulation dark matter haloes is detected.\n", "  We study the transport properties of setups with one and two mesoscopic rings\nthreaded by ac magnetic fluxes of the form \\Phi(t)=\\Phi^{dc} + \\Phi^{ac}\ncos(\\Omega_0 t + \\delta) and connected to two different particle reservoirs. We\nanalyze the conditions to generate a pumped dc current in the adiabatic regime.\nWe also study the symmetry properties of the induced dc current as a function\nof the static component of the flux, \\Phi^{dc}, with and without a dc bias\nvoltage applied at the reservoirs. We analyze, in particular, the validity of\nthe Onsager-Casimir relations for different configurations of the setups.\n", "  There exists the \"entropy problem\" of the early universe, that is, why did\nthe universe begin with an extremely low entropy and how did it evolve into\nsuch high entropy at late times? It has been long believed that inflation\ncannot be the solution since it requires an extremely low entropy to ever\noccur. However, we point out that since the inflation is always accompanied\nwith a horizon, the correct probability of inflation is associated with the\nquantum entanglement entropy, which should in principle be larger than what\nconsidered previously. This motivates us to reexamine the issue by computing\nthe evolution of the cosmological entanglement entropy in the early universe.\nWe invoke a toy model of nonlinear generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG), which has\nthe advantage of providing a smooth and unitary transition between the\ninflation epoch and the radiation dominant era. We found that soon after the\nonset of the inflation, the total entanglement entropy rapidly decreases to a\nminimum, and it rises monotonically afterwards throughout the remainder of the\ninflation and the radiation epochs. This indicates that the universe does not\nneed to begin with an extremely low entropy; its smallness can be naturally\ninduced by the dynamics of inflation itself. We believe that our computation\nlargely captures the essential feature of entropy evolution and can provide us\ninsights beyond the toy model.\n", "  A gain-assisted plasmonic waveguide with two detuned resonators is\ninvestigated in the plasmon-induced transparency window. Phase map is employed\nto study power transmittance and group delay for varying gain coefficients and\nfrequency detunings of the two resonators. The gain coefficient for lasing\noscillation condition is analytically shown to vary quadratically with the\nfrequency detuning. In the amplification regime below the lasing threshold, the\nspectrum implies not only large group delay, but also high transmittance and\nnarrow linewidth. This is in contrast to those in the loss-compensation regime\nand the passive case in which there always exists a trade-off between the\nlinewidth and the peak transmittance.\n", "  The features of pulsed $\\gamma$-ray emission from classical and millisecond\npulsars indicate that the high energy radiation processes in their inner\nmagnetospheres occur in a similar way. In the last decade several TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray nebulae have been discovered around classical pulsars. The above\nfacts suggest that $\\gamma$-rays should be produced also in the surroundings of\nmillisecond pulsars. We discuss a model for the bow shock nebula around the\nwell known Black Widow binary system containing the millisecond pulsar\nB1957+20. This model predicts the existence of a synchrotron X-ray and inverse\nCompton $\\gamma$-ray nebula around this system. We want to find out whether\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from the nebula around B1957+20 could be detected by the\nfuture and present Cherenkov telescopes. Using the Monte Carlo method we\nfollowed the propagation of relativistic electrons in the vicinity of the\npulsar. We calculated the very high energy radiation produced by them in the\nsynchrotron process and the inverse Compton scattering of the Microwave\nBackground Radiation and of the infrared radiation from the galactic disk. We\nalso computed the X-ray emission produced by the electrons in the synchrotron\nprocess. We show that the hard X-ray tail emission observed from the vicinity\nof B1957+20 can be explained by our model. Moreover, we predict that the TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission produced by the electrons in the inverse Compton process\nshould be detectable by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array and possibly by\nthe long term observations with the present Cherenkov arrays such as MAGIC and\nVERITAS. The $\\gamma$-ray emission from B1957+20 is expected to be extended,\ninhomogeneous, and shifted from the present location of the binary system by a\ndistance comparable to the radius of the nebula.\n", "  We consider nebulae which are created around binary systems containing\nrotation powered pulsars and companion stars with strong stellar winds. It is\nproposed that the stellar and pulsar winds have to mix at some distance from\nthe binary system, defined by the orbital period of the companion stars and the\nvelocity of the stellar wind. The mixed pulsar-stellar wind expands with a\nspecific velocity determined by the pulsar power and the mass loss rate of the\ncompanion star. Relativistic particles, either from the inner pulsar\nmagnetosphere and/or accelerated at the shocks between stellar and pulsar\nwinds, are expected to be captured and isotropized in the reference frame of\nthe mixed wind. Therefore, they can efficiently comptonize stellar radiation\nproducing GeV-TeV $\\gamma$-rays in the inverse Compton process. We calculate\nthe $\\gamma$-ray spectra expected in such scenario for the two example binary\nsystems: J1816+4510 which is the redback type millisecond binary and LS 5039\nwhich is supposed to contain energetic pulsar. It is concluded that the steady\nTeV $\\gamma$-ray emission from J1816+4510 should be on the 100 hr sensitivity\nlimit of the planned Cherenkov Telescope Array, provided that $\\epsilon\\sim\n10%$ of the rotational energy lost by the pulsar is transferred to TeV\nelectrons. On the other hand, the comparison of the predicted steady TeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission, expected from $\\gamma$-ray binary LS 5039, with the\nobservations of the TeV emission in a low state, reported by the H.E.S.S.\nCollaboration, allows us to put stringent upper limit on the product of the\npart of the hemisphere in which the mixed pulsar-stellar wind is confined,\n$\\Delta_{\\rm mix}$, and the energy conversion efficiency, $\\epsilon$, from the\nsupposed pulsar to the TeV electrons injected in this system, $\\Delta_{\\rm\nmix}\\cdot \\epsilon <1%$.\n", "  We study some effects the inclusion of the radiation energy component in the\nuniverse, Omega_r, can have on several quantities of interest for the\nlarge-scale structure of the universe in a LCDM cosmological simulation;\nstarted at a very high redshift (z=500). In particular we compute the power\nspectrum density, the halo mass function, and the concentration-mass relation\nfor haloes. We find that Omega_r has an important contribution in the long-term\nnonlinear evolution of structures in the universe. For instance, a lower matter\ndensity power, by approx 50%, in all scales is obtained when compared with a\nsimulation without the radiation term. Also, haloes formed with the Omega_r\ntaken into account are approx 20% less concentrated than when not included in\nthe Hubble function.\n", "  The generation of spin current and spin polarization in a 2DEG structure is\nstudied in the presence of Dresselhaus and Rashba spin-orbit couplings (SOC),\nthe strength of the latter being modulated in time by an ac gate voltage. By\nmeans of the non-Abelian gauge field approach, we established the relation\nbetween the Lorentz spin force and the spin current in the SOC system, and\nshowed that the longitudinal component of the spin force induces a transverse\nspin current. For a constant (time-invariant) Rashba system, we recover the\nuniversal spin Hall conductivity of $\\frac e{8\\pi}$, derived previously via the\nBerry phase and semiclassical methods. In the case of a time-dependent SOC\nsystem, the spin current is sustained even under strong impurity scattering. We\nevaluated the ac spin current generated by a time-modulated Rashba SOC in the\nabsence of any dc electric field. The magnitude of the spin current reaches a\nmaximum when the modulation frequency matches the Larmor frequency of the\nelectrons.\n", "  It was proposed that the central dense stellar cluster in the Galactic\nCenter, containing the mass of $\\sim$4 times larger than that of the central\nblack hole, had been formed as a result of a merging of several massive\nglobular clusters. These globular clusters are expected to provide a large\nnumber of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within the central parsec of the Galactic\nCenter. We propose that the GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission observed from the\nGalactic Center is in fact a cumulative effect of the emission from several\nglobular clusters captured by the Galactic Center black hole. Moreover, the\nmillisecond pulsars in globular clusters accelerate leptons in their wind zones\nto energies of the order of a few tens of TeV injecting them into the dense\ninfrared and optical radiation region present within the central parsec. We\ncalculate the expected TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission produced by these leptons by\nthe Inverse Compton Scattering process in the soft radiation field. It is shown\nthat this emission can be responsible for the multi-TeV $\\gamma$-rays observed\nby the Cherenkov telescopes from the Galactic Center for reasonable densities\nof the soft radiation, diffusion models for the propagation of leptons, their\ninjection parameters (fluxes and spectral proprieties). If the energy\nconversion efficiency from the pulsars to the relativistic leptons is of the\norder of 10%, then about a thousand of MSPs have to be present in the central\ncluster in the Galactic Center.\n", "  Using the slave-rotor mean-field theory, we study the formation of Kondo\nresonance in graphene induced from vacancies. At the Dirac neutrality point, we\nfind acritical hybridization strength beyond which the Kondo resonance takes\nplace, despite vanishing density of states. We also find that the line-shapes\nof the Kondo peak are entirely different from Lorentzian shown in normal\nmetallic hosts. The dependence of Kondo temperature on the effective\nhybridization parameter of the spinon field turns out to be linear in contrast\nto the quadratic dependence in normal metals. Upon doping we find strong\nelectron-hole asymmetry for the dependence of Kondo temperature on the chemical\npotential.\n", "  We introduce a natural \"massive\" version of the Brownian loop soup of Lawler\nand Werner which displays conformal covariance and exponential decay. We show\nthat this massive Brownian loop soup arises as the near-critical scaling limit\nof a random walk loop soup with killing and is related to the massive SLE(2)\nidentified by Makarov and Smirnov as the near-critical scaling limit of a\nloop-erased random walk with killing. We conjecture that the massive Brownian\nloop soup describes the zero level lines of the massive Gaussian free field,\nand discuss possible relations to other models, such as Ising, in the\noff-critical regime.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the class of constacyclic codes, which is a\nnatural generalization of the class of cyclic and negacyclic codes. This class\nof codes is interesting in the sense that it contains codes with good or even\noptimal parameters. In this light, we propose constructions of families of\nclassical block and convolutional maximum-distance-separable (MDS) constacyclic\ncodes, as well as families of asymmetric quantum MDS codes derived from\n(classical-block) constacyclic codes. These results are mainly derived from the\ninvestigation of suitable properties on cyclotomic cosets of these\ncorresponding codes.\n", "  We show how to use relativistic motion and local phase shifts to generate\ncontinuous variable Gaussian cluster states within cavity modes. Our results\ncan be demonstrated experimentally using superconducting circuits where\ntuneable boundary conditions correspond to mirrors moving with velocities close\nto the speed of light. In particular, we propose the generation of a\nquadripartite square cluster state as a first example that can be readily\nimplemented in the laboratory. Since cluster states are universal resources for\nuniversal one-way quantum computation, our results pave the way for\nrelativistic quantum computation schemes.\n", "  A significant amount of the millisecond pulsars has been discovered within\nbinary systems. In several such binary systems the masses of the companion\nstars have been derived allowing to distinguish two classes of objects, called\nthe Black Widow and the Redback binaries. Pulsars in these binary systems are\nexpected to produce winds which, colliding with stellar winds, create\nconditions for acceleration of electrons. These electrons should interact with\nthe anisotropic radiation from the companion stars producing gamma-ray emission\nmodulated with the orbital period of the binary system. We consider the\ninteraction of a millisecond pulsar (MSP) wind with a very inhomogeneous\nstellar wind from the companion star within binary systems of the Black Widow\nand Redback types. It is expected that the pulsar wind should mix efficiently\nwith the inhomogeneous stellar wind. Electrons accelerated in such mixed,\nturbulent winds can interact with the magnetic field and also strong radiation\nfrom the companion star producing not only synchrotron radiation but also\ngamma-rays in the the Inverse Compton process. Applying numerical methods, we\ncalculated the GeV-TeV gamma-ray spectra and the light curves expected from\nsome millisecond pulsar binary systems. It is concluded that energetic\nmillisecond pulsar binary systems create a new class of TeV gamma-ray sources\nwhich could be detectable by the future Cherenkov arrays (e.g. CTA) and\npossibly also by the extensive campaigns with the present arrays (HESS, MAGIC,\nVERITAS). However, gamma-ray emission from the millisecond pulsar binary\nsystems is predicted to have different features than those observed in the case\nof massive TeV gamma-ray binaries such as LS I 303 61 or LS 5039. The maximum\nin the TeV gamma-ray orbital light curve should appear when the MSP is behind\nthe companion star.\n", "  Quantum weak measurements with states both pre- and postselected offer a\nwindow into a hitherto neglected sector of quantum mechanics. A class of such\nsystems involves time dependent evolution with transitions possible. In this\npaper we explore two very simple systems in this class. The first is a toy\nmodel representing the decay of an excited atom. The second is the tunneling of\na particle through a barrier. The postselection criteria are chosen as follows:\nat the final time, the \"atom\" remains in its initial excited state for the\nfirst example and the particle remains behind the barrier for the second. We\nthen ask what weak values are predicted in the physical environment of the\n\"atom\" (to which no net energy has been transferred) and in the region beyond\nthe barrier (to which the particle has not tunneled). Previous work suggests\nthat very large weak values might arise in these regions for long durations\nbetween pre- and postselection times. Our calculations reveal some distinct\ndifferences between the two model systems.\n", "  Achieving robust transport has attracted much attention in both electronic\nand photonic systems. Time-reversal invariant photonic crystal can be employed\nto realize backscattering-immune chiral state, but the chiral bandgap is\ntopologically trivial. Here, we designed and fabricated a metacrystal\ncomprising non-resonant meta-atoms sandwiched between two metallic plates and\nthe system exhibits topological phase transition as established by group\nclassification. The nontrivial bandgap was confirmed by experimentally measured\ntransmission spectra, calculated nonzero spin Chern number and Z2 index.\nGapless spin-filtered edge states were demonstrated experimentally by measuring\nthe magnitude and phase of the fields. The transpsort robustness of the edge\nstates were also observed when an obstacle is introduced near the edge.\n", "  Probing deeper into the existing issues regarding the exit probability (EP)\nin one dimensional dynamical models, we consider several models where the\nstates are represented by Ising spins and the information flows inwards. At\nzero temperature, these systems evolve to either of two absorbing states. The\nexit probability $E(x)$, which is the probability that the system ends up with\nall spins up starting with $x$ fraction of up spins is found to have the\ngeneral form $E(x) = x^\\alpha/\\left[x^\\alpha + (1-x)^\\alpha\\right]$. The exit\nprobability exponent $\\alpha$ strongly depends on $r$, the range of\ninteraction, the symmetry of the model and the induced fluctuation. Even in a\nnearest neighbour model, nonlinear form of EP can be obtained by controlling\nthe fluctuations and for the same range, different models give different\nresults for $\\alpha$. Non-universal behaviour of the exit probability is thus\nclearly established and the results are compared to existing studies in models\nwith outflow dynamics to distinguish the two dynamical scenarios.\n", "  Self-diffusion and radial distribution functions are studied in a strongly\nconfined Lennard-Jones fluid. Surprisingly, in the solid-liquid phase\ntransition region, where the system exhibits dynamic coexistence, the\nself-diffusion constants are shown to present up to three-fold variations from\nsolid to liquid phases at fixed temperature, while the radial distribution\nfunction corresponding to both the liquid and the solid phases are essentially\nindistinguishable.\n", "  We study kink scattering processes in the (1+1)-dimensional $\\varphi^6$ model\nin the framework of the collective coordinate approximation. We find critical\nvalues of the initial velocities of the colliding kinks. These critical\nvelocities distinguish different regimes of collisions. The exact equation of\nmotion for the $\\varphi^6$ model is also solved numerically with the same\ninitial conditions. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the collective\ncoordinate approximation, and also outline its applicability limits. Resonance\nphenomena and the so-called escape windows are also observed in the kink\ncollisions.\n", "  We consider the Cahn-Hilliard equation in one space dimension, perturbed by\nthe derivative of a space and time white noise of intensity $\\epsilon^{\\frac\n12}$, and we investigate the effect of the noise, as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, on the\nsolutions when the initial condition is a front that separates the two stable\nphases. We prove that, given $\\gamma< \\frac 23$, with probability going to one\nas $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the solution remains close to a front for times of the\norder of $\\epsilon^{-\\gamma}$, and we study the fluctuations of the front in\nthis time scaling. They are given by a one dimensional continuous process, self\nsimilar of order $\\frac 14$ and non Markovian, related to a fractional Brownian\nmotion and for which a couple of representations are given.\n", "  We investigate the spin Hall effect (SHE) in a wide class of spin-orbit\ncoupling systems by using spin force picture. We derive the general relation\nequation between spin force and spin current and show that the longitudinal\nforce component can induce a spin Hall current, from which we reproduce the\nspin Hall conductivity obtained previously using Kubo's formula. This simple\nspin force picture gives a clear and intuitive explanation for SHE.\n", "  We present a 2+1 decomposition of the vacuum initial conditions in general\nrelativity. For a constant mean curvature one of the momentum constraints\ndecouples in quasi isotropic coordinates and it can be solved by quadrature.\nThe remaining momentum constraints are written in the form of the tangential\nCauchy-Riemann equation. Under additional assumptions its solutions can be\nwritten in terms of integrals of known functions. We show how to obtain initial\ndata with a marginally outer trapped surface. A generalization of the Kerr data\nis presented.\n", "  We derive a formula for the Bondi mass aspect in terms of asymptotic data of\nthe Bondi-Sachs metric in the affine gauge. We prove the positivity of the\ntotal energy of a regular null cone in agreement with a recent result of\nChru\\'{s}ciel and Paetz.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of metamaterial blueprints describing, and\nfundamental limitations concerning, perfectly reflectionless omnidirectional\nelectromagnetic absorbers (PR-OEMA). Previous attempts to define PR-OEMA\nblueprints have led to active (gain), rather than passive, media. We explain\nthis fact and unveil new, distinct limitations of true PR-OEMA devices,\nincluding the appearance of an \"electromagnetic horizon\" on physical solutions.\nAs practical alternatives we introduce alternative OEMA blueprints\ncorresponding to media that, while not reflectionless, are nonetheless\neffective in absorbing incident waves in a manner robust to incident wave\ndiversity.\n", "  Tailored electrostatic potentials are the foundation of scanning gate\nmicroscopy. We present several aspects of the tip-induced potential on the\ntwo-dimensional electron gas. First, we give methods on how to estimate the\nsize of the tip-induced potential. Then, a ballistic cavity is formed and\nstudied as a function of the bias-voltage of the metallic top gates and probed\nwith the tip-induced potential. It is shown how the potential of the cavity\nchanges by tuning the system to a regime where conductance quantization in the\nconstrictions formed by the tip and the top gates occurs. This conductance\nquantization leads to a unprecedented rich fringe pattern over the entire\nstructure. Finally, the effect of electrostatic screening of the metallic top\ngates is discussed.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the enhancement of thermoelectric cooling\nperformance in thermoelectric devices made of materials with inhomogeneous\nthermal conductivity, beyond the usual practice of enhancing thermoelectric\nfigure of merit ZT. The dissipation of Joule heat in such thermoelectric\ndevices is asymmetric which can give rise to better thermoelectric cooling\nperformance. Although the thermoelectric figure of merit and the\ncoefficient-of-performance are only slightly enhanced, both the maximum cooling\npower and the maximum cooling temperature difference can be enhanced\nsignificantly. This finding can be used to increase the heat absorption at the\ncold end. The asymmetric dissipation of Joule heat also leads to thermal\nrectification.\n", "  This article presents the result that fluctuations and higher moments of a\nstate do not imply quantum corrections in structure functions of constrained\nsystems. Consequences for canonical quantum gravity, whose structure functions\nencode space-time structure, are discussed. In particular, deformed algebras\nfound in models of loop quantum gravity provide reliable information even in\nthe Planck regime.\n", "  We proposed a group-theory method to calculate topological invariant in\nbi-isotropic photonic crystals invariant under crystallographic point group\nsymmetries. Spin Chern number has been evaluated by the eigenvalues of rotation\noperators at high symmetry k-points after the pseudo-spin polarized fields are\nretrieved. Topological characters of photonic edge states and photonic band\ngaps can be well predicted by total spin Chern number. Nontrivial phase\ntransition is found in large magnetoelectric coupling due to the jump of total\nspin Chern number. Light transport is also issued at the {\\epsilon}/{\\mu}\nmismatching boundary between air and the bi-isotropic photonic crystal. This\nfinding presents the relationship between group symmetry and photonic\ntopological systems, which enables the design of photonic nontrivial states in\na rational manner.\n", "  We demonstrate a spatial-imaging thermometry technique for ions in a\none-dimensional Coulomb crystal by relating their imaged spatial extent along\nthe linear radiofrequency ion trap axis to normal modes of vibration of coupled\noscillators in a harmonic potential. We also use the thermal spatial spread of\nbright ions in the case of a two-species mixed chain to measure the\ncenter-of-mass (COM) resonance frequency of the entire chain and infer the\nmolecular composition of the co-trapped dark ions. These non-destructive\ntechniques create new possibilities for better understanding of sympathetic\ncooling in mixed-ion chains, improving few-ion mass spectrometry, and\ntrapped-ion thermometry without requiring a scan of Doppler cooling parameters.\n", "  In a recent Letter we have shown that in shift-symmetric Horndeski theory the\nscalar field is forced to obtain a nontrivial configuration in black hole\nspacetimes, unless a linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant is tuned\naway. As a result, black holes generically have hair in this theory. In this\ncompanion paper, we first review our argument and discuss it in more detail. We\nthen present actual black hole solutions in the simplest case of a theory with\nthe linear scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We generate exact solutions\nnumerically for a wide range of values of the coupling and also construct\nanalytic solutions perturbatively in the small coupling limit. Comparison of\nthe two types of solutions indicates that non-linear effects that are not\ncaptured by the perturbative solution lead to a finite area, as opposed to a\ncentral, singularity. Remarkably, black holes have a minimum size, controlled\nby the length scale associated with the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We also\ncompute some phenomenological observables for the numerical solution for a wide\nrange of values of the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling. Deviations from the\nSchwarzschild geometry are generically very small.\n", "  We propose a new type of the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) emerging from the\nRashba spin-orbit coupling in asymmetric four-terminal electron systems. This\nsystem generates spin currents or spin voltages along the longitudinal\ndirection parallel to the temperature gradient in the absence of magnetic\nfields. The remarkable result arises from the breaking of reflection symmetry\nalong the transverse direction. In the meantime, the SSE along the transverse\ndirection, so-called the spin Nernst effect, with spin currents or spin\nvoltages perpendicular to the temperature gradient can be simultaneously\nrealized in our system. We further find that it is possible to use the\ntemperature differences between four leads to tune the spin Seebeck\ncoefficients.\n", "  A fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb Josephson junctions (JJs) with sizes\ndown to 200 nm has been developed on a 200-mm-wafer tool set typical for CMOS\nfoundry. This process is the core of several nodes of a roadmap for\nfully-planarized fabrication processes for superconductor integrated circuits\nwith 4, 8, and 10 niobium layers developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The\nprocess utilizes 248 nm photolithography, anodization, high-density plasma\netching, and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) for planarization of SiO$_2$\ninterlayer dielectric. JJ electric properties and statistics such as on-chip\nand wafer spreads of critical current, $I_c$, normal-state conductance, $G_N$,\nand run-to-run reproducibility have been measured on 200-mm wafers over a broad\nrange of JJ diameters from 200 nm to 1500 nm and critical current densities,\n$J_c$, from 10 kA/$cm^2$ to 50 kA/$cm^2$ where the JJs become self-shunted.\nDiffraction-limited photolithography of JJs is discussed. A relationship\nbetween JJ mask size, JJ size on wafer, and the minimum printable size for\ncoherent and partially coherent illumination has been worked out. The $G_N$ and\n$I_c$ spreads obtained have been found to be mainly caused by variations of the\nJJ areas and agree with the model accounting for an enhancement of mask errors\nnear the diffraction-limited minimum printable size of JJs. $I_c$ and $G_N$\nspreads from 0.8% to 3% have been obtained for JJs with sizes from 1500 nm down\nto 500 nm. The spreads increase to about 8% for 200-nm JJs. Prospects for\ncircuit densities > $10^6$ JJ/$cm^2$ and 193-nm photolithography for JJ\ndefinition are discussed.\n", "  A model for observable effects of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations is\npresented. The model involves a probe pulse which traverses a slab of nonlinear\noptical material with a nonzero second order polarizability. We argue that the\npulse interacts with the ambient vacuum fluctuations of other modes of the\nquantized electric field, and these vacuum fluctuations cause variations in the\nflight time of the pulse through the material. The geometry of the slab of\nmaterial defines a sampling function for the quantized electric field, which in\nturn determines that vacuum modes whose wavelengths are of the order of the\nthickness of the slab give the dominant contribution. Some numerical estimates\nare made, which indicate that fractional fluctuations in flight time of the\norder of $10^{-9}$ are possible in realistic situations. The model presented\nhere is both an illustration of a physical effect of vacuum fluctuations, and\nan analog model for the lightcone fluctuations predicted by quantum gravity.\n", "  In this paper we study generalised Ising Glauber models with inflow of\ninforma- tion in one dimension and derive expressions for the exit probability\nusing well established analytical methods. The analytical expressions agree\nvery well with the results obtained from numerical simulation only when the\ninteraction is restricted to the nearest neighbor. But as the range of\ninteraction is increased the analytical results deviate from simulation results\nsystematically. The reasons for the deviation as well as some related open\nquestions are discussed.\n", "  Globular clusters (GCs) contain huge number of low mass stars and also large\nnumber of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Due to the number of stars, the stellar\nand MSP winds mix efficiently within the GC. Such mixture of winds leaves GC\nand interacts with the galactic medium creating a bow shock nebula around GC.\nThe bow shock nebula is filled with relativistic leptons accelerated in the\npulsar magnetospheres and/or wind regions. We argue that nebulae around\nglobular clusters, immersed in relatively dense medium close to the galactic\nplane, should have complicated morphology due to interaction with the\nsurrounding gas. Therefore, TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources, related to these nebulae,\nare expected to be misaligned in respect to GC cores, as observed in the case\nof GC Ter 5. On the other hand, GCs in low density medium, i.e. far away from\nthe galactic disk, should produce bow shocks at large distances from the GC\ncores. The TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources around such nebulae are expected to be\nalmost spherical and centred on the GC cores. We perform numerical calculations\nof the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission produced by leptons escaping from the GC Ter\n5. It is shown that TeV $\\gamma$-ray source related to Ter 5 should be\nmisaligned in respect to the core of GC as observed by the HESS Collaboration.\n", "  Mumford-Shah and Potts functionals are powerful variational models for\nregularization which are widely used in signal and image processing; typical\napplications are edge-preserving denoising and segmentation. Being both\nnon-smooth and non-convex, they are computationally challenging even for scalar\ndata. For manifold-valued data, the problem becomes even more involved since\ntypical features of vector spaces are not available. In this paper, we propose\nalgorithms for Mumford-Shah and for Potts regularization of manifold-valued\nsignals and images. For the univariate problems, we derive solvers based on\ndynamic programming combined with (convex) optimization techniques for\nmanifold-valued data. For the class of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds (which\nincludes the data space in diffusion tensor imaging), we show that our\nalgorithms compute global minimizers for any starting point. For the\nmultivariate Mumford-Shah and Potts problems (for image regularization) we\npropose a splitting into suitable subproblems which we can solve exactly using\nthe techniques developed for the corresponding univariate problems. Our method\ndoes not require any a priori restrictions on the edge set and we do not have\nto discretize the data space. We apply our method to diffusion tensor imaging\n(DTI) as well as Q-ball imaging. Using the DTI model, we obtain a segmentation\nof the corpus callosum.\n", "  TeV gamma-ray emission has been recently observed from direction of a few\nopen clusters containing massive stars. We consider the high energy processes\noccurring within massive binary systems and in their dense environment by\nassuming that nuclei, from the stellar winds of massive stars, are accelerated\nat the collision region of the stellar winds. We calculate the rates of\ninjection of protons and neutrons from fragmentation of these nuclei in\ncollisions with stellar radiation and matter of the winds from the massive\ncompanions in binary system. Protons and neutrons can interact with the matter,\nwithin the stellar wind cavity and within the open cluster, producing pions\nwhich decay into $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. We discuss the detectability of\nsuch $\\gamma$-ray emission by the present and future Cherenkov telescopes for\nthe case of two binary systems Eta Carinae, within the Carina Nebula, and WR\n20a, within the Westerlund 2 open cluster. We also calculate the neutrino\nfluxes produced by protons around the binary systems and within the open\nclusters. This neutrino emission is confronted with ANTARES upper limits on the\nneutrino fluxes from discrete sources and with the sensitivity of IceCube.\n", "  We formulate and characterize a model to describe the dynamics of\nsemiflexible polymers in the presence of activity due to motor proteins\nattached irreversibly to a substrate, and a transverse pulling force acting on\none end of the filament. The stochastic binding-unbinding of the motor proteins\nand their ability to move along the polymer, generates active forces. As the\npulling force reaches a threshold value, the polymer eventually desorbs from\nthe substrate. Performing molecular dynamics simulations of the polymer in\npresence of a Langevin heat bath, and stochastic motor activity, we obtain\ndesorption phase diagrams. The correlation time for fluctuations in desorbed\nfraction increases as one approaches complete desorption, captured\nquantitatively by a power law spectral density. We present theoretical analysis\nof the phase diagram using mean field approximations in the weakly bending\nlimit of the polymer and performing linear stability analysis. This predicts\nincrease in the desorption force with the polymer bending rigidity, active\nvelocity and processivity of the motor proteins to capture the main features of\nthe simulation results.\n", "  Defects play a key role in determining the properties of most materials and,\nbecause they tend to be highly localized, characterizing them at the\nsingle-defect level is particularly important. Scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM) has a history of imaging the electronic structure of individual point\ndefects in conductors, semiconductors, and ultrathin films, but single-defect\nelectronic characterization at the nanometer-scale remains an elusive goal for\nintrinsic bulk insulators. Here we report the characterization and manipulation\nof individual native defects in an intrinsic bulk hexagonal boron nitride (BN)\ninsulator via STM. Normally, this would be impossible due to the lack of a\nconducting drain path for electrical current. We overcome this problem by\nemploying a graphene/BN heterostructure, which exploits graphene's atomically\nthin nature to allow visualization of defect phenomena in the underlying bulk\nBN. We observe three different defect structures that we attribute to defects\nwithin the bulk insulating boron nitride. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n(STS), we obtain charge and energy-level information for these BN defect\nstructures. In addition to characterizing such defects, we find that it is also\npossible to manipulate them through voltage pulses applied to our STM tip.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the thermal boundary conductance across\nmetal-nonmetal interfaces in the presence of the electron-phonon coupling not\nonly in metal but also at interface. The thermal energy can be transferred from\nmetal to nonmetal via three channels: (1) the phonon-phonon coupling at\ninterface; (2) the electron-phonon coupling at interface; and (3) the\nelectron-phonon coupling within metal and then subsequently the phonon-phonon\ncoupling at interface. We find that these three channels can be described by an\nequivalent series-parallel thermal resistor network, based on which we derive\nout the analytic expression of the thermal boundary conductance. We then\nexemplify different contributions from each channel to the thermal boundary\nconductance in three typical interfaces: Pb-diamond, Ti-diamond, and TiN-MgO.\nOur results reveal that the competition among above channels determines the\nthermal boundary conductance.\n", "  We have investigated the ferromagnetic (FM) phase which suddenly develops in\nUCo1-xRuxAl and is isolated by paramagnetic regions on both sides from the\nparent UCoAl and URuAl. For that purpose we have grown high quality single\ncrystals with x = 0.62, 0.70, 0.74, 0.75 and 0.78. The properties of the FM\nphase have been investigated by microscopic and macroscopic methods. Polarized\nneutron diffraction on a single crystal with x = 0.62 revealed the gradual\ngrowth of the hybridization between U and T-site in the U - T plane with\nincreasing x. Hybridization works here as a mediator of the strong indirect\ninteraction, while the delocalized character of the 5 f states is still\nconserved. As a result very weak spontaneous magnetic moments are observed for\nall alloys with magnitude nearly in proportion to the TC for x < 0.62, while an\nenormous disproportion exists between them near xcrit.. The magnetization,\nspecific heat, electrical resistivity, and Hall effect measurements confirmed\nthat the FM transition is suppressed continuously at the critical concentration\nxcrit. = 0.77. Two quantum critical points are then expected on both sides of\nthe FM dome. We propose a scenario that the order of the FM/PM transition\ndiffers at opposite boundaries of the FM dome. We conclude that both\ncriticalities are influenced by disorder. Criticality on the UCoAl side has the\ncharacter of a clean FM metal, while on the Ru rich side it has the character\nof a magnetically inhomogeneous system involving a Griffiths phase.\n", "  We construct five dimensional black rings in global anti-de Sitter space\nusing numerical methods. These rings satisfy the BPS bound $| J | < M \\ell$,\nbut the angular velocity always violates the Hawking-Reall bound $| \\Omega_H\n\\ell | \\leq 1$, indicating that they should be unstable under superradiance. At\nhigh temperatures, the limit $| \\Omega_H \\ell | \\searrow 1$ is attained by thin\nrings with an arbitrarily large radius. However, at sufficiently low\ntemperatures, this limit is saturated by a new kind of rings, whose outer\ncircle can still be arbitrarily long while the hole in the middle does not grow\nproportionally. This gives rise to a membrane-like horizon geometry, which does\nnot have an asymptotically flat counterpart. We find no evidence for thin AdS\nblack rings whose transverse $S^2$ is much larger than the radius of AdS,\n$\\ell$, and thus these solutions never fall into the hydrodynamic regime of the\ndual CFT. Thermodynamically, we find that AdS black rings never dominate the\ngrand canonical ensemble. The behaviour of our solutions in the microcanonical\nensemble approaches known perturbative results in the thin-ring limit.\n", "  Recent progress of Reciprocal Quantum Logic (RQL) has renewed interest in AC\npowering of superconductor digital circuits, which had been abandoned since the\nfamous IBM project of 1970s. In this work we propose and demonstrate new\nAC-biased Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) circuits, and search for synergy of AC and\ncurrently dominating DC biasing schemes. As the first step, we suggest an\non-chip AC/DC converter capable of feeding a few DC-biased gates surrounded by\ntheir AC-biased counterparts. As the second step, we introduce and present the\nfirst successful demonstration of a new AC-powered circuit - an 8192-bit shift\nregister with over 32,800 Josephson junctions (JJs) and JJ density of about\n6x$10^5$ JJ per $cm^2$. We suggest a few niche applications for this type of\nAC-biased circuits, not requiring high clock rates. E.g., these, scalable to\nmillions of JJs per chip, circuits can serve as a convenient benchmark for new\nSFQ fabrication technology nodes, allowing the operating margins of individual\ncells to be extracted and, thus, 'visualize' individual fabrication defects and\nflux trapping events. The circuit can also be developed into a mega-pixel\nimaging array for a magnetic field microscope.\n", "  We compute the stochastic gravitational wave production from Affleck-Dine\ncondensate fragmentation in the early universe, focusing on an effective\npotential with a logarithmic mass correction that typically arises in gravity\nmediated supersymmetry breaking scenarios. We find that a significant\ngravitational wave background can be generated when Q-balls are being formed\nout of the condensate fragmentation. This gravitational wave background has a\ndistinct multi-peak power spectrum where the trough is closely linked to the\nsupersymmetry breaking scale and whose frequencies are peaked around kHz for\nTeV supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  We predict intrinsic half-metallicity in armchair boron nitride nanoribbons\n(ABNNRs) via edge fluorination. The stability, electronic and magnetic\nproperties of bare and edge fluorinated ABNNRs have been systematically\nanalyzed by means of first-principles calculations within the local\nspin-density approximation (LSDA). The ribbons whose only edge-B atoms\npassivated with F atoms (i.e., edge-N atoms are un-passivated), regardless of\nwidth, are found half-metallic with a half-metal gap of 0.3 eV. A 100 \\% spin\npolarized charge transport across the Fermi level is expected for such ribbons\nas the spin polarized states are $\\sim$0.4 eV more stable than the spin\nun-polarized states and only single-spin conducting channels are present across\nthe Fermi level owing to the gigantic spin splitting. The existence of\nhalf-metallicity is attributed to the localization of electronic charge at bare\nedge-N atoms as revealed from the analysis of Bloch states and projected\ndensity of states (PDOS).The sufficiently large half-metal gap (0.3 eV) with\nhuge difference in the energies ($\\sim$ 0.4 eV) of spin polarized and spin\ncompensated states projects these half-metallic ABNNRs as potential candidate\nfor spintronics applications.\n", "  We demonstrate a facile fabrication technique for graphene-based transparent\nconductive films. Highly flat and uniform graphene films are obtained through\nthe incorporation of an efficient laser annealing technique with one-time drop\ncasting of high-concentration graphene ink. The resulting thin films are\nuniform and exhibit a transparency of more than 85% at 550 nm and a sheet\nresistance of about 30 k{\\Omega}/sq. These values constitute an increase of 45%\nin transparency, a reduction of surface roughness by a factor of four and a\ndecrease of 70% in sheet resistance compared to unannealed films.\n", "  Skyrmion lines in metallic chiral magnets carry an emergent magnetic field\nexperienced by the conduction electrons. The inflow and outflow of this field\nacross a closed surface is not necessarily equal, thus it allows for the\nexistence of emergent monopoles. One example is a segment of skyrmion line\ninside a crystal, where a monopole and antimonopole pair is connected by the\nemergent magnetic flux line. This is a realization of Dirac string-like\nexcitations. Here we study the dynamics of monopoles in chiral magnets under an\nelectric current. We show that in the process of creation of skyrmion lines,\nskyrmion line segments are first created via the proliferation of monopoles and\nantimonopoles. Then these line segments join and span the whole system through\nthe annihilation of monopoles. The skyrmion lines are destroyed via the\nproliferation of monopoles and antimonopoles at high currents, resulting in a\nchiral liquid phase. We also propose to create the monopoles in a controlled\nway by applying an inhomogenous current to a crystal. Remarkably, an electric\nfield component in the magnetic field direction proportional to the current\nsquared in the low current region is induced by the motion of distorted\nskyrmion lines, in addition to the Hall and longitudinal voltage. The existence\nof monopoles can be inferred from transport or imaging measurements.\n", "  The main topic of these lecture notes is the continuum scaling limit of\nplanar lattice models. One reason why this topic occupies an important place in\nthe theory of probability and mathematical statistical physics is that scaling\nlimits provide the link between statistical mechanics and (Euclidean) field\ntheory. In order to explain the main ideas behind the concept of scaling limit,\nI will focus on a \"toy\" model that exhibits the typical behavior of statistical\nmechanical models at and near the critical point. This model, known as the\nrandom walk loop soup, is actually interesting in its own right. It can be\ndescribed as a Poissonian ensemble of lattice loops, or a lattice gas of loops\nsince it fits within the ideal gas framework of statistical mechanics. After\nintroducing the model and discussing some interesting connections with the\ndiscrete Gaussian free field, I will present some results concerning its\nscaling limit, which leads to a Poissonian ensemble of continuum loops known as\nthe Brownian loop soup. The latter was introduced by Lawler and Werner and is a\nvery interesting object with connections to the Schramm-Loewner Evolution and\nvarious models of statistical mechanics. In the second part of the lectures, I\nwill use the Brownian loop soup to construct a family of functions that behave\nlike correlation functions of a conformal field. I will then use these\nfunctions and their derivation to introduce the concept of conformal field and\nto explore the connection between scaling limits and conformal fields.\n", "  The Suzaku data of the highly variable magnetar 1E 1547.0$-$5408, obtained\nduring the 2009 January activity, were reanalyzed. The 2.07 s pulsation of the\n15--40 keV emission detected with the HXD was found to be phase modulated, with\na period of $36.0^{+4.5}_{-2.5}$ ks and an amplitude of $0.52 \\pm 0.14$ s. The\nmodulation waveform is suggested to be more square-wave like rather than\nsinusoidal. While the effect was confirmed with the 10--14 keV XIS data, the\nmodulation amplitude decreased towards lower energies, becoming consistent with\n0 below 4 keV. After the case of 4U 0142+61, this makes the 2nd example of this\nkind of behavior detected from magnetars. The effect can be interpreted as a\nmanifestation of free precession of this magnetar, which is suggested to be\noblately deformed under the presence of strong toroidal field of $\\sim 10^{16}$\nG.\n", "  We present a framework for investigating the response of\nconformally-invariant confined 1+1-dimensional systems to a quantum quench.\nWhile conformal invariance is generally destroyed in a global quantum quench,\nsystems that can be described as or mapped to integrable deformations of a CFT\nmay present special instances where a conformal field theory-based analysis\ncould provide useful insight into the non-equilibrium dynamics. We investigate\nthis possibility by considering a quench analogous to that of the Quantum\nNewton's Cradle experiment [Nature 440, 900 (2006)] and demonstrating\nqualitative agreement between observables derived in the CFT framework and\nthose of the experimental system. We propose that this agreement may be a\nfeature of the proximity of the experimental system to an integrable\ndeformation of a c=1 CFT.\n", "  The nature of the phase separation in KxFe2-ySe2 single crystals is not well\nunderstood. Here, temperature dependent SEM images provide compelling evidence\nthat phase separation corresponds to a nucleation and growth process rather\nthan a spinodal decomposition. The superconducting phase is the remnant of high\ntemperature phase after iron vacancy order-disorder transition. Three-dimension\n(3D) spatial distribution of superconducting phase in the iron vacancy ordered\nmatrix was revealed by using focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy\n(FIB-SEM). Our results clearly show that superconducting phase forms a\nhierarchical structure. Understanding the formation of this hierarchical\nstructure not only can guide the synthesis of bulk superconductors in the\nfuture, but also greatly enrich our knowledge about the interplay between phase\nseparation and solid-state phase transformations.\n", "  We propose a dynamical scheme for deterministically amplifying photonic\nSchroedinger cat states based on a set of optimal state-transfers. The scheme\ncan be implemented in strongly coupled qubit-cavity systems and is well suited\nto the capabilities of state of the art superconducting circuits. The ideal\nanalytical scheme is compared with a full simulation of the open\nJaynes-Cummings model with realistic device parameters. This amplification tool\ncan be utilized for practical quantum information processing in non-classical\ncontinuous-variable states.\n", "  Electromagnetic interaction between a sub-wavelength particle (the `probe')\nand a material surface (the `sample') is studied theoretically. The interaction\nis shown to be governed by a series of resonances corresponding to surface\npolariton modes localized near the probe. The resonance parameters depend on\nthe dielectric function and geometry of the probe, as well as the surface\nreflectivity of the material. Calculation of such resonances is carried out for\nseveral types of axisymmetric probes: spherical, spheroidal, and pear-shaped.\nFor spheroids an efficient numerical method is developed, capable of handling\ncases of large or strongly momentum-dependent surface reflectivity. Application\nof the method to highly resonant materials such as aluminum oxide (by itself or\ncovered with graphene) reveals a rich structure of multi-peak spectra and\nnonmonotonic approach curves, i.e., the probe-sample distance dependence. These\nfeatures also strongly depend on the probe shape and optical constants of the\nmodel. For less resonant materials such as silicon oxide, the dependence is\nweak, so that the spheroidal model is reliable. The calculations are done\nwithin the quasistatic approximation with the radiative damping included\nperturbatively.\n", "  The complexity of a quantum state may be closely related to the usefulness of\nthe state for quantum computation. We discuss this link using the tree size of\na multiqubit state, a complexity measure that has two noticeable (and, so far,\nunique) features: it is in principle computable, and non-trivial lower bounds\ncan be obtained, hence identifying truly complex states. In this paper, we\nfirst review the definition of tree size, together with known results on the\nmost complex three and four qubits states. Moving to the multiqubit case, we\nrevisit a mathematical theorem for proving a lower bound on tree size that\nscales superpolynomially in the number of qubits. Next, states with\nsuperpolynomial tree size, the Immanant states, the Deutsch-Jozsa states, the\nShor's states and the subgroup states, are described. We show that the\nuniversal resource state for measurement based quantum computation, the\n2D-cluster state, has superpolynomial tree size. Moreover, we show how the\ncomplexity of subgroup states and the 2D cluster state can be verified\nefficiently. The question of how tree size is related to the speed up achieved\nin quantum computation is also addressed. We show that superpolynomial tree\nsize of the resource state is essential for measurement based quantum\ncomputation. The necessary role of large tree size in the circuit model of\nquantum computation is still a conjecture; and we prove a weaker version of the\nconjecture.\n", "  Quantum anomalies are the breaking of a classical symmetry by quantum\nfluctuations. They dictate how physical systems of diverse nature, ranging from\nfundamental particles to crystalline materials, respond topologically to\nexternal perturbations, insensitive to local details. The anomaly paradigm was\ntriggered by the discovery of the chiral anomaly that contributes to the decay\nof pions into photons and influences the motion of superfluid vortices in\n$^3$He-A. In the solid state, it also fundamentally affects the properties of\ntopological Weyl and Dirac semimetals, recently realized experimentally in\nTaAs, Na$_3$Bi, Cd$_3$As$_2$, and ZrTe$_{5}$. In this work we propose that the\nmost identifying consequence of the chiral anomaly, the charge density\nimbalance between fermions of different chirality induced by non-orthogonal\nelectric and magnetic fields, can be directly observed in these materials with\nthe existing technology of photoemission spectroscopy. With angle resolution,\nthe chiral anomaly is identified by a characteristic note-shaped pattern of the\nemission spectra, originating from the imbalanced occupation of the bulk states\nand a previously unreported momentum dependent energy shift of the surface\nstate Fermi arcs. We further demonstrate that the chiral anomaly likewise\nleaves an imprint in angle averaged emission spectra, facilitating its\nexperimental detection. Thereby, our work provides essential theoretical input\nto foster the direct visualization of the chiral anomaly in condensed matter.\n", "  Formation of localized magnetic states in a metallic host is a classic\nproblem ofcondensed matter physics formalized by P. W. Anderson within the so\ncalled single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). The general picture in a host of\na simple one-band metal is that a large Hubbard $U$ in the impurity orbital is\npre-requisite for the formation of localized magnetic states. In recent years\nthree dimensional (3D) Dirac solids have emerged the hallmark of which is\nstrong spin-orbit interaction. In this work we show that such a strong\nspin-orbit interaction allows to form localized magnetic states even with small\nvalues of Hubbard $U$. This opens up the fascinating possibility of forming\nmagnetic states with $s$ or $p$ orbital impurities -- different from\ntraditional paradigms of $d$ or $f$ orbital based magnetic moments.\n", "  Unitary representations of the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_N(Q)$ on the tensor\nspace $({\\mathbb C^n})^{\\otimes N}$ are considered. Two criteria are given for\ndetermining when an orthogonal projection matrix $P$ of a rank $r$ gives rise\nto such a representation. The first of them is the equality of traces of\ncertain matrices and the second is the unitary condition for a certain\npartitioned matrix. Some estimates are obtained on the lower bound of $Q$ for a\ngiven dimension $n$ and rank $r$. It is also shown that if $4r>n^2$, then $Q$\ncan take only a discrete set of values determined by the value of $n^2/r$. In\nparticular, the only allowed value of $Q$ for $n=r=2$ is $Q=\\sqrt{2}$. Finally,\nproperties of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the quantum Hopf algebra\n$U_q(su_2)$ are used in order to find all $r=1$ and $r=2$ unitary tensor space\nrepresentations of $TL_N(Q)$ such that $Q$ depends continuously on $q$ and $P$\nis the projection in the tensor square of a simple $U_q(su_2)$ module on the\nsubspace spanned by one or two joint eigenvectors of the Casimir operator $C$\nand the generator $K$ of the Cartan subalgebra.\n", "  In this work the dynamics of self-gravitating systems composed by dark and\nbaryonic matter is analyzed. Searching for a description of this dynamics, a\nsystem of collisionless Boltzmann equations for the two constituents and the\nPoisson equation for the gravitational field are employed. Through the solution\nof these equations the collapse criterion is determined from a dispersion\nrelation. The collapse occurs in an unstable region where the solutions grow\nexponentially with time. It is shown that the unstable region becomes larger if\nthe dispersion velocity of dark matter becomes larger than the one of the\nbaryonic matter. The results obtained are also compared with the case where\nonly the dark matter is present. The model of the present work has a higher\nlimit of instability and therefore, exhibited an advantage in the structure\nformation.\n", "  Models for which the likelihood function can be evaluated only up to a\nparameter-dependent unknown normalising constant, such as Markov random field\nmodels, are used widely in computer science, statistical physics, spatial\nstatistics, and network analysis. However, Bayesian analysis of these models\nusing standard Monte Carlo methods is not possible due to the intractability of\ntheir likelihood functions. Several methods that permit exact, or close to\nexact, simulation from the posterior distribution have recently been developed.\nHowever, estimating the evidence and Bayes' factors (BFs) for these models\nremains challenging in general. This paper describes new random weight\nimportance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods for estimating BFs that\nuse simulation to circumvent the evaluation of the intractable likelihood, and\ncompares them to existing methods. In some cases we observe an advantage in the\nuse of biased weight estimates. An initial investigation into the theoretical\nand empirical properties of this class of methods is presented. Some support\nfor the use of biased estimates is presented, but we advocate caution in the\nuse of such estimates.\n", "  Flag manifolds are shown to describe the relations between configurations of\ndistinguished points (topologically equivalent to punctures) embedded in a\ngeneral spacetime manifold. Grassmannians are flag manifolds with just two\nsubsets of points selected out from a set of N points. The geometry of\nGrassmannians is determined by a group acting by linear fractional\ntransformations, and the associated Lie algebra induces transitions between\nsubspaces. Curvature tensors are derived for a general flag manifold, showing\nthat interactions between a subset of k points and the remaining N-k points in\nthe configuration is determined by the coordinates in the flag manifold.\n", "  We propose a formalism for counting the microstates of a class of\nthree-dimensional black holes which are not asymptotically AdS. The formalism\nrests on the invariance of a dual field theory under a generalized modular\ntransformation and is extended to Rindler horizons by a singular limit. We also\nobtain logarithmic corrections.\n", "  We develop a universal approach to the one-loop effective field theory (EFT)\nusing the Covariant Derivative Expansion (CDE) method. We generalise previous\nresults to include broader classes of UV models, showing how expressions\npreviously obtained assuming degenerate heavy-particle masses can be extended\nto non-degenerate cases. We apply our method to the general MSSM with\nnon-degenerate stop squarks, illustrating our approach with calculations of the\ncoefficients of dimension-6 operators contributing to the $hgg$ and\n$h\\gamma\\gamma$ couplings, and comparing with exact calculations of one-loop\nFeynman diagrams. We then use present and projected future sensitivities to\nthese operator coefficients to obtain present and possible future indirect\nconstraints on stop masses. The current sensitivity is already comparable to\nthat of direct LHC searches, and future FCC-ee measurements could be sensitive\nto stop masses above a TeV. The universality of our one-loop EFT approach\nfacilitates extending these constraints to a broader class of UV models.\n", "  Recent progress on studies of the nanoscale mechanical responses in\ndisordered systems has highlighted a strong degree of heterogeneity in the\nelastic moduli. In this contribution, using computer simulations, we study the\nelastic heterogeneities in athermal amorphous solids, composed of isotropic,\nstatic, sphere packings, near the jamming transition. We employ techniques,\nbased on linear response methods, that are amenable to experimentation. We find\nthat the local elastic moduli are randomly distributed in space and are\ndescribed by Gaussian probability distributions, thereby lacking any\nsignificant spatial correlations, that persists all the way down to the\ntransition point. However, the shear modulus fluctuations grow as the jamming\nthreshold is approached, which is characterized by a new power-law scaling.\nThrough this diverging behavior we are able to identify a characteristic length\nscale, associated with shear modulus heterogeneities, that distinguishes\nbetween bulk and local elastic responses.\n", "  We present the results of approximately three years of observations of Planck\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) sources with telescopes at the Canary Islands\nobservatories as part of the general optical follow-up programme undertaken by\nthe Planck collaboration. In total, 78 SZ sources are discussed. Deep-imaging\nobservations were obtained for most of these sources; spectroscopic\nobservations in either in long-slit or multi-object modes were obtained for\nmany. We effectively used 37.5 clear nights. We found optical counterparts for\n73 of the 78 candidates. This sample includes 53 spectroscopic redshift\ndeterminations, 20 of them obtained with a multi-object spectroscopic mode. The\nsample contains new redshifts for 27 Planck clusters that were not included in\nthe first Planck SZ source catalogue (PSZ1).\n", "  We briefly review a number of important recent experimental and theoretical\ndevelopments in the field of dynamic fracture. Topics include experimental\nvalidation of the equations of motion for straight tensile cracks (in both\ninfinite media and strip geometries), validation of a new theoretical\ndescription of the near-tip fields of dynamic cracks incorporating weak elastic\nnonlinearities, a new understanding of dynamic instabilities of tensile cracks\nin both 2D and 3D, crack front dynamics, and the relation between frictional\nmotion and dynamic shear cracks. Related future research directions are briefly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Most behavioral and social experiments aimed at revealing contextuality are\nconfined to cyclic systems with binary outcomes. In quantum physics, this broad\nclass of systems includes as special cases\nKlyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky-type, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bell-type, and\nSuppes-Zanotti-Leggett-Garg-type systems. The theory of contextuality known as\nContextuality-by-Default allows one to define and measure contextuality in all\nsuch system, even if there are context-dependent errors in measurements, or if\nsomething in the contexts directly interacts with the measurements. This makes\nthe theory especially suitable for behavioral and social systems, where direct\ninteractions of \"everything with everything\" are ubiquitous. For cyclic systems\nwith binary outcomes the theory provides necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor noncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain\nquantum systems. We review several behavioral and social data sets (from polls\nof public opinion to visual illusions to conjoint choices to word combinations\nto psychophysical matching), and none of these data provides any evidence for\ncontextuality. Our working hypothesis is that this may be a broadly applicable\nrule: behavioral and social systems are noncontextual, i.e., all \"contextual\neffects\" in them result from the ubiquitous dependence of response\ndistributions on the elements of contexts other than the ones to which the\nresponse is presumably or normatively directed.\n", "  It is well-known that the standard WKB approximation fails to provide\nsemiclassical solutions in the vicinity of turning points. However, turning\npoints arise in many cosmological scenarios. In a previous work, we obtained a\nnew class of semiclassical solutions of the Wheeler-deWitt equation using the\nconjugate momentum to the geometric variable. We present here a detailed study\nof their main properties. We carefully compare them to usual WKB solutions and\nturning point resolutions using Airy functions. We show that the momentum\nrepresentation possesses many advantages that are absent in other apporaches.\nIn particular, this framework has a key application in tackling the problem of\ntime. It allows us to use curvature as a time variable, and control the\ncorresponding domain of validity, i.e. under which conditions it provides a\ngood clock. We consider several applications, and in particular show how this\nallows us to obtain semiclassical solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nparametrized by York time.\n", "  The focus of this work is on an alternative implementation of the iterative\nensemble smoother (iES). We show that iteration formulae similar to those used\nin \\cite{chen2013-levenberg,emerick2012ensemble} can be derived by adopting a\nregularized Levenberg-Marquardt (RLM) algorithm \\cite{jin2010regularized} to\napproximately solve a minimum-average-cost (MAC) problem. This not only leads\nto an alternative theoretical tool in understanding and analyzing the behaviour\nof the aforementioned iES, but also provides insights and guidelines for\nfurther developments of the smoothing algorithms. For illustration, we compare\nthe performance of an implementation of the RLM-MAC algorithm to that of the\napproximate iES used in \\cite{chen2013-levenberg} in three numerical examples:\nan initial condition estimation problem in a strongly nonlinear system, a\nfacies estimation problem in a 2D reservoir and the history matching problem in\nthe Brugge field case. In these three specific cases, the RLM-MAC algorithm\nexhibits comparable or even better performance, especially in the strongly\nnonlinear system.\n", "  We classify and analyze the stability of all relative equilibria for the\ntwo-body problem in the hyperbolic space of dimension 2 and we formulate our\nresults in terms of the intrinsic Riemannian data of the problem.\n", "  Long expected transition states between the rotation powered and accretion\npowered non-thermal emission in the millisecond pulsar binary systems have been\nrecently observed in the case of three objects PSR J1023+0038, PSR J1824-2452,\nand PSR J1227-4859. Surprisingly, the transition is related to the significant\nchange in the $\\gamma$-ray flux being a factor of a few higher with the\npresence of an accretion disk. The origin of this enhanced emission seems to be\nrelated to the penetration of the inner pulsar magnetosphere by the accretion\ndisk. We propose that the radiation processes, characteristic for the rotation\npowered pulsar, can co-exist with the presence of an accretion disk in the\ninner pulsar magnetosphere. In our scenario additional $\\gamma$-ray emission is\nproduced by secondary leptons, originated close to the acceleration gap, which\nCompton up-scatter thermal radiation from the accretion disk to GeV energies.\nThe accretion disk penetrates deep into the pulsar magnetosphere allowing the\nmatter to fall onto the NS surface producing pulsed X-ray emission. We show\nthat the sum of the rotation powered pulsar $\\gamma$-ray emission, produced by\nthe primary electrons in the curvature process, and the $\\gamma$-ray emission,\nproduced by secondary leptons, can explain the observed high energy radiation\nfrom the redback binary pulsar PSR J1227-4853 in the state with evidences of\nthe accretion disk.\n", "  We study the momentum distribution of the electrons in an extended periodic\nAnderson model, where the interaction, $U_{cf}$, between itinerant and\nlocalized electrons is taken into account. In the symmetric half-filled model,\ndue to the increase of the interorbital interaction, the $f$ electrons become\nmore and more delocalized, while the itinerancy of conduction electrons\ndecreases. Above a certain value of $U_{cf}$ the $f$ electrons become again\nlocalized together with the conduction electrons. In the less than half-filled\ncase, we observe that $U_{cf}$ causes strong correlations between the $f$\nelectrons in the mixed valence regime.\n", "  In de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity and bigravity, a\nnon-minimal matter coupling involving both metrics generically re-introduces\nthe Boulware--Deser (BD) ghost. A non-minimal matter coupling via a simple, yet\nspecific composite metric has been proposed, which eliminates the BD ghost\nbelow the strong coupling scale. Working explicitly in the metric formulation\nand for arbitrary spacetime dimensions, we show that this composite metric is\nthe unique consistent non-minimal matter coupling below the strong coupling\nscale, which emerges out of two diagnostics, namely, absence of Ostrogradski\nghosts in the decoupling limit and absence of the BD ghost from matter quantum\nloop corrections.\n", "  The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the density of topological defects\nproduced in the dynamical processes of phase transitions in systems ranging\nfrom cosmology to condensed matter and quantum materials. The similarity\nbetween KZM and the Landau-Zener transition (LZT), which is a standard tool to\ndescribe the dynamics of some non-equilibrium physics in contemporary physics,\nis being extensively exploited. Here we demonstrate the equivalence between KZM\nin the Ising model and LZT in a superconducting qubit system. We develop a\ntime-resolved approach to study quantum dynamics of LZT with nano-second\nresolution. By using this technique, we simulate the key features of KZM in the\nIsing model with LZT, e.g., the boundary between the adiabatic and impulse\nregions, the freeze-out phenomenon in the impulse region, especially, the\nscaling law of the excited state population as the square root of the quenching\nrate. Our results supply the experimental evidence of the close connection\nbetween KZM and LZT, two textbook paradigms to study the dynamics of the\nnon-equilibrium phenomena.\n", "  We obtain an energy inequality on null surfaces $u=const$ in the Bondi-Sachs\nformalism. We show that for a sufficiently regular event horizon $H$ there is\nan affine radial coordinate which is constant on $H$. Then the energy\ninequality can be prolongated to the horizon giving an estimation which is\nclosely related to the Penrose inequality. We test it for the Kerr solution\nwritten in the Fletcher-Lun coordinates.\n", "  Lattice data for the QCD equation of state and the magnetic susceptibility\ncomputed near the crossover transition at zero magnetic field are used to\ndetermine the input parameters of a five dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton\nholographic model. Once the model parameters are fixed at zero magnetic field,\none can use this holographic construction to study the effects of a magnetic\nfield on the equilibrium and transport properties of the quark-gluon plasma. In\nthis paper we use this model to study the dependence of the crossover\ntemperature with an external magnetic field. Our results for the pressure of\nthe plasma and the crossover temperature are in quantitative agreement with\ncurrent lattice data for values of the magnetic field $0 \\le eB \\lesssim 0.3$\nGeV$^2$, which is the relevant range for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision\napplications.\n", "  In the previous paper of Alicki et.al. a model of a solar cell has been\nproposed in which the non-periodic source of energy - photon flux - drives the\ncollective periodic motion of electrons in a form of plasma oscillations.\nSubsequently, plasma oscillations are rectified by the p-n junction diode into\nthe direct current (work). This approach makes a solar cell similar to standard\nmacroscopic heat motors or turbines which always contain two heat baths, the\nworking medium and the periodically moving piston or rotor. Here, a very\nsimilar model is proposed in order to describe the operation principles of\nthermoelectric generators based either on bimetallic or semiconductor p-n\njunctions. Again plasma oscillation corresponds to a piston and sunlight is\nreplaced by a hot bath. The mathematical formalism is based on the Markovian\nmaster equations which can be derived in a rigorous way from the underlying\nHamiltonian models and are consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.\n", "  An enhanced Fourier law (EFL) that accounts for quasi-ballistic phonon\ntransport effects in a formulation entirely in terms of physical observables,\nis derived from the Boltzmann transport equation, assuming a gray population of\nquasi-ballistic phonon modes. This equation is generalized to an arbitrary\nphonon population. Other phonon transport models are analyzed in the context of\nthe generalized EFL and connections are made between the generalized EFL and\nother models, revealing the essential unity of seemingly disparate models\nreported in the literature.\n", "  When a microorganism begins swimming from rest in a Newtonian fluid such as\nwater, it rapidly attains its steady-state swimming speed since changes in the\nvelocity field spread quickly when the Reynolds number is small. However,\nswimming microorganisms are commonly found or studied in complex fluids.\nBecause these fluids have long relaxation times, the time to attain the steady-\nstate swimming speed can also be long. In this article we study the swimming\nstartup problem in the simplest liquid crystalline fluid: a two-dimensional\nhexatic liquid crystal film. We study the dependence of startup time on\nanchoring strength and Ericksen number, which is the ratio of viscous to\nelastic stresses. For strong anchoring, the fluid flow starts up immediately\nbut the liquid crystal field and swimming velocity attain their sinusoidal\nsteady-state values after a time proportional to the relaxation time of the\nliquid crystal. When the Ericksen number is high, the behavior is the same as\nin the strong anchoring case for any anchoring strength. We also find that the\nstartup time increases with the ratio of the rotational viscosity to the shear\nviscosity, and then ultimately saturates once the rotational viscosity is much\ngreater than the shear viscosity.\n", "  Restricted Boltzmann machines are undirected neural networks which have been\nshown to be effective in many applications, including serving as\ninitializations for training deep multi-layer neural networks. One of the main\nreasons for their success is the existence of efficient and practical\nstochastic algorithms, such as contrastive divergence, for unsupervised\ntraining. We propose an alternative deterministic iterative procedure based on\nan improved mean field method from statistical physics known as the\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer approach. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides\nperformance equal to, and sometimes superior to, persistent contrastive\ndivergence, while also providing a clear and easy to evaluate objective\nfunction. We believe that this strategy can be easily generalized to other\nmodels as well as to more accurate higher-order approximations, paving the way\nfor systematic improvements in training Boltzmann machines with hidden units.\n", "  The completion of low rank matrices from few entries is a task with many\npractical applications. We consider here two aspects of this problem:\ndetectability, i.e. the ability to estimate the rank $r$ reliably from the\nfewest possible random entries, and performance in achieving small\nreconstruction error. We propose a spectral algorithm for these two tasks\ncalled MaCBetH (for Matrix Completion with the Bethe Hessian). The rank is\nestimated as the number of negative eigenvalues of the Bethe Hessian matrix,\nand the corresponding eigenvectors are used as initial condition for the\nminimization of the discrepancy between the estimated matrix and the revealed\nentries. We analyze the performance in a random matrix setting using results\nfrom the statistical mechanics of the Hopfield neural network, and show in\nparticular that MaCBetH efficiently detects the rank $r$ of a large $n\\times m$\nmatrix from $C(r)r\\sqrt{nm}$ entries, where $C(r)$ is a constant close to $1$.\nWe also evaluate the corresponding root-mean-square error empirically and show\nthat MaCBetH compares favorably to other existing approaches.\n", "  We introduce new quantities for exploratory causal inference between\nbivariate time series. The quantities, called penchants and leanings, are\ncomputationally straightforward to apply, follow directly from assumptions of\nprobabilistic causality, do not depend on any assumed models for the time\nseries generating process, and do not rely on any embedding procedures; these\nfeatures may provide a clearer interpretation of the results than those from\nexisting time series causality tools. The penchant and leaning are computed\nbased on a structured method for computing probabilities.\n", "  We study stress time series caused by plastic avalanches in athermally\nsheared disordered materials. Using particle-based simulations and a mesoscopic\nelasto-plastic model, we analyze size and shear-rate dependence of the\nstress-drop durations and size distributions together with their average\ntemporal shape. We find critical exponents different from mean-field\npredictions, and a clear asymmetry for individual avalanches. We probe scaling\nrelations for the rate dependency of the dynamics and we report a crossover\ntowards mean-field results for strong driving.\n", "  We propose a quantum processor for the scalable quantum computation on\nmicrowave photons in distant one-dimensional superconducting resonators. It is\ncomposed of a common resonator R acting as a quantum bus and some distant\nresonators $r_j$ coupled to the bus in different positions assisted by\nsuperconducting quantum interferometer devices (SQUID), different from previous\nprocessors. R is coupled to one transmon qutrit, and the coupling strengths\nbetween $r_j$ and R can be fully tuned by the external flux through the SQUID.\nTo show the processor can be used to achieve universal quantum computation\neffectively, we present a scheme to complete the high-fidelity quantum state\ntransfer between two distant microwave-photon resonators and another one for\nthe high-fidelity controlled-phase gate on them. By using the technique for\ncatching and releasing the microwave photons from resonators, our processor may\nplay an important role in quantum communication as well.\n", "  We consider a simple scenario for the accretion of matter onto a neutron star\nin order to understand processes in the inner pulsar magnetosphere during the\ntransition stage between different accretion modes. A simple quasi-spherical\naccretion process onto rotating, magnetized compact object is analyzed in order\nto search for the radiative signatures which could appear during transition\nbetween ejecting and accreting modes. It is argued that different accretion\nmodes can be present in a single neutron star along different magnetic field\nlines for specific range of parameters characterising the pulsar (rotational\nperiod, surface magnetic field strength) and the density of surrounding medium.\nThe radiation processes characteristic for the ejecting pulsar, i.e. curvature\nand synchrotron radiation produced by primary electrons in the pulsar outer\ngap, are expected to be modified by the presence of additional thermal\nradiation from the neutron star surface. We predict that during the transition\nfrom the pure ejector to the pure accretor mode (or vice versa) an intermediate\naccretion state can be distinguished which is characterized by the $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra of pulsars truncated below ~1 GeV due to the absorption of\nsynchro-curvature spectrum produced in the pulsar gaps.\n", "  Filters whose porosity decreases with depth are often more efficient at\nremoving solute from a fluid than filters with a uniform porosity. We\ninvestigate this phenomenon via an extension of homogenization theory that\naccounts for a macroscale variation in microstructure. In the first stage of\nthe paper, we homogenize the problems of flow through a filter with a\nnear-periodic microstructure and of solute transport due to advection,\ndiffusion, and filter adsorption. In the second stage, we use the\ncomputationally efficient homogenized equations to investigate and quantify why\nporosity gradients can improve filter efficiency. We find that a porosity\ngradient has a much larger effect on the uniformity of adsorption than it does\non the total adsorption. This allows us to understand how a decreasing porosity\ncan lead to a greater filter efficiency, by lowering the risk of localized\nblocking while maintaining the rate of total contaminant removal.\n", "  We studied effects of disorder in a three dimensional layered Chern\ninsulator. By calculating the localization length and density of states\nnumerically, we found two distict types of metallic phases between Anderson\ninsulator and Chern insulator; one is diffusive metallic (DM) phase and the\nother is renormalized Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase. We show that longitudinal\nconductivity at the zero energy state remains finite in the renormalizd WSM\nphase as well as in the DM phase, while goes to zero at a semimetal-metal\nquantum phase transition point between these two. Based on the Einstein\nrelation combined with the self-consistent Born analysis, we give a\nconductivity scaling near the quantum transition point.\n", "  We study the consequences of an electron-phonon ($e$-$ph$) interaction that\nis strongly peaked in the forward scattering ($\\mathbf{q} = 0$) direction in a\ntwo-dimensional superconductor using Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We find that\nstrong forward scattering results in an enhanced $T_c$ that is linearly\nproportional to the strength of the dimensionless $e$-$ph$ coupling constant\n$\\lambda_m$ in the weak coupling limit. This interaction also produces distinct\nreplica bands in the single-particle spectral function, similar to those\nobserved in recent angle-resolved photoemission experiments on FeSe monolayers\non SrTiO$_3$ and BaTiO$_3$ substrates. By comparing our model to photoemission\nexperiments, we infer an $e$-$ph$ coupling strength that can provide a\nsignificant portion of the observed high $T_c$ in these systems.\n", "  Recent data from Reticulum II (RetII) require the energy range of the\nFermiLAT $\\gamma$-excess to be $\\sim$ $2-10$ GeV. We adjust our unified\nnonthermal Dark Matter (DM) model to accommodate this. We have two extra\nscalars beyond the Standard Model to also explain 3.55 keV X-ray line. Now the\nmass of the heavier of them has to be increased to lie around 250 GeV, while\nthat of the lighter one remains at 7.1 keV. This requires a new seed mechanism\nfor the $\\gamma$-excess and new Boltzmann equations for the generation of the\nDM relic density. All concerned data for RetII and the X-ray line can now be\nfitted well and consistency with other indirect limits attained.\n", "  The neighborhood of the QCD chiral critical point is characterized by intense\nfluctuations of the chiral field which could, in principle, generate pronounced\nexperimental signatures. However, experimental uncertainties which are inherent\nto heavy ion collisions, as well as the modest size and duration of the formed\nplasma, will severely attenuate these signatures. Using Monte Carlo techniques,\nwe study second-order event-by-event moments of pions as a prototype for\nsignatures of the chiral critical point based on the enhancement of the\ncorrelation length and event-by-event analysis. We test their viability against\nsome realistic ingredients, similar to the ones found in the RHIC Beam Energy\nScan program.\n", "  The auto-correlation between two members of a galaxy population is symmetric\nunder the interchange of the two galaxies being correlated. The\ncross-correlation between two different types of galaxies, separated by a\nvector $\\bf{r}$, is not necessarily the same as that for a pair separated by\n$-\\bf{r}$. Local anisotropies in the two-point cross-correlation function may\nthus indicate a specific direction which when mapped as a function of position\ntrace out a vector field. This vector field can then be decomposed into\nlongitudinal and transverse components, and those transverse components written\nas positive- and negative-helicity components. A locally asymmetric\ncross-correlation of the longitudinal type arises naturally in halo clustering,\neven with Gaussian initial conditions, and could be enhanced with local-type\nnon-Gaussianity. Early-Universe scenarios that introduce a vector field may\nalso give rise to such effects. These antisymmetric cross-correlations also\nprovide a new possibility to seek a preferred cosmic direction correlated with\nthe hemispherical power asymmetry in the cosmic microwave background and to\nseek a preferred location associated with the CMB cold spot. New ways to seek\ncosmic parity breaking are also possible.\n", "  We study effects of random fluid motion on a system in a self-organized\ncritical state. The latter is described by the continuous stochastic model,\nproposed by Hwa and Kardar [{\\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf 62}: 1813 (1989)]. The\nadvecting velocity field is Gaussian, not correlated in time, with the pair\ncorrelation function of the form $\\propto \\delta(t-t') / k_{\\bot}^{d-1+\\xi}$,\nwhere $k_{\\bot}=|{\\bf k}_{\\bot}|$ and ${\\bf k}_{\\bot}$ is the component of the\nwave vector, perpendicular to a certain preferred direction -- the\n$d$-dimensional generalization of the ensemble introduced by Avellaneda and\nMajda [{\\it Commun. Math. Phys.} {\\bf 131}: 381 (1990)]. Using the field\ntheoretic renormalization group we show that, depending on the relation between\nthe exponent $\\xi$ and the spatial dimension $d$, the system reveals different\ntypes of large-scale, long-time scaling behaviour, associated with the three\npossible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. They correspond\nto ordinary diffusion, to passively advected scalar field (the nonlinearity of\nthe Hwa--Kardar model is irrelevant) and to the \"pure\" Hwa--Kardar model (the\nadvection is irrelevant). For the special choice $\\xi=2(4-d)/3$ both the\nnonlinearity and the advection are important. The corresponding critical\nexponents are found exactly for all these cases.\n", "  When a dense stream of dry, non-cohesive grains hits a fixed target, a\ncollimated sheet is ejected from the impact region, very similar to what\nhappens for a stream of water. In this study, as a continuation of the\ninvestigation why such remarkably different incident fluids produce such\nsimilar ejecta, we use discrete particle simulations to collide two\nunequal-width granular jets head-on in two dimensions. In addition to the\nfamiliar coherent ejecta, we observe that the impact produces a far less\nfamiliar quasi-steady-state corresponding to a uniformly translating free\nsurface and flow field. Upon repeating such impacts with multiple continuum\nfluid simulations, we show that this translational speed is controlled only by\nthe total energy dissipation rate to the power $1.5$, and is independent of the\ndetails of the jet composition. Our findings, together with those from impacts\nagainst fixed targets, challenge the principle of scattering in which material\ncomposition is inferred from observing the ejecta produced during impact.\n", "  We present a three-loop model of neutrino mass in which both the weak scale\nand neutrino mass arise as radiative effects. In this approach, the scales for\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, dark matter, and the exotics responsible for\nneutrino mass, are related due to an underlying scale-invariance. This\nmotivates the otherwise-independent O(TeV) exotic masses usually found in\nthree-loop models of neutrino mass. We demonstrate the existence of viable\nparameter space and show that the model can be probed at colliders, precision\nexperiments, and dark matter direct-detection experiments.\n", "  Various implementations of the Toffoli gate up to a relative phase have been\nknown for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller\ncircuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of\nquantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being\napplied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not\nmatter. It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would\nprevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical\nlarge-scale designs.\n  In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for\nreplacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with\ntheir simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on\ncertain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate\nthe advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known\ncircuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions\nin the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest\nthat a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their\nuse may yield other optimizations.\n", "  Thermodynamic properties of matter are conveniently expressed as functional\nrelations between variables known as equations of state. Here we experimentally\ndetermine the compressibility, density and pressure equations of state for an\nattractive 2D Fermi gas in the normal phase as a function of temperature and\ninteraction strength. In 2D, interacting gases exhibit qualitatively different\nfeatures to those found in 3D. This is evident in the normalized density\nequation of state, which peaks at intermediate densities corresponding to the\ncrossover from classical to quantum behaviour.\n", "  Multiple-post reentrant 3D lumped cavity modes have been realized to design\nthe concept of discrete Whispering Gallery and Fabry-Perot-like Modes for\nmultimode microwave Quantum Electrodynamics experiments. Using a magnon\nspin-wave resonance of a submillimeter-sized Yttrium-Iron-Garnet sphere at\nmilliKelvin temperatures and a four-post cavity, we demonstrate the\nultra-strong coupling regime between discrete Whispering Gallery Modes and a\nmagnon resonance with strength of 1.84 GHz. By increasing the number of posts\nto eight and arranging them in a D$_4$ symmetry pattern, we expand the mode\nstructure to that of a discrete Fabry-Perot cavity and modify the Free Spectral\nRange (FSR). We reach the superstrong coupling regime, where spin-photon\ncoupling strength is larger than FSR, with coupling strength in the 1.1 to 1.5\nGHz range.\n", "  We explore the effect of transverse confinement on the stability of a\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) loaded in a shaken one-dimensional or\ntwo-dimensional square lattice. We calculate the decay rate from two-particle\ncollisions. We predict that if the transverse confinement exceeds a critical\nvalue, then, for appropriate shaking frequencies, the condensate is stable\nagainst scattering into transverse directions.\n", "  We have studied the optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) Schottky\nphotodiode heterojunctions made of chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene on\nn- and p-type Silicon (Si) substrates. Much better rectification behavior is\nobserved from the diodes fabricated on n- Si substrates in comparison with the\ndevices on p-Si substrates in dark condition. Also, graphene/n-Si photodiodes\nshow a considerable responsivity of 270 mA/W within the silicon spectral range\nin DC reverse bias condition. The present results are furthermore compared with\nthat of a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/p-type silicon photodiodes.\n", "  This paper reviews the experimental and theoretical state of the art in\nballistic hot electron transistors that utilize two-dimensional base contacts\nmade from graphene, i.e. graphene base transistors (GBTs). Early performance\npredictions that indicated potential for THz operation still hold true today,\neven with improved models that take non-idealities into account. Experimental\nresults clearly demonstrate the basic functionality, with on/off current\nswitching over several orders of magnitude, but further developments are\nrequired to exploit the full potential of the GBT device family. In particular,\ninterfaces between graphene and semiconductors or dielectrics are far from\nperfect and thus limit experimental device integrity, reliability and\nperformance.\n", "  For a general sensory system following an external stochastic signal, we\nintroduce the sensory capacity. This quantity characterizes the performance of\na sensor: sensory capacity is maximal if the instantaneous state of the sensor\nhas as much information about a signal as the whole time-series of the sensor.\nWe show that adding a memory to the sensor increases the sensory capacity. This\nincrease quantifies the improvement of the sensor with the addition of the\nmemory. Our results are obtained with the framework of stochastic\nthermodynamics of bipartite systems, which allows for the definition of an\nefficiency that relates the rate with which the sensor learns about the signal\nwith the energy dissipated by the sensor, which is given by the thermodynamic\nentropy production. We demonstrate a general tradeoff between sensory capacity\nand efficiency: if the sensory capacity is equal to its maximum 1, then the\nefficiency must be less than 1/2. As a physical realization of a sensor we\nconsider a two component cellular network estimating a fluctuating external\nligand concentration as signal. This model leads to coupled linear Langevin\nequations that allow us to obtain explicit analytical results.\n", "  The COBRA collaboration aims to search for neutrinoless double beta-decay of\n$^{116}$Cd. A demonstrator setup with 64 CdZnTe semiconductor detectors, each\nwith a volume of 1cm$^3$, is currently being operated at the LNGS underground\nlaboratory in Italy. This paper reports on the characterization of a large (2\n$\\times$ 2 $\\times$ 1.5)cm$^3$ CdZnTe detector with a new coplanar-grid design\nfor applications in $\\gamma$-ray spectroscopy and low-background operation.\nSeveral studies of electric properties as well as of the spectrometric\nperformance, like energy response and resolution, are conducted. Furthermore,\nmeasurements including investigating the operational stability and a\npossibility to identify multiple-scattered photons are presented.\n", "  We present a spatio-temporal mechanism for producing 2D optical rogue waves\nin the presence of a turbulent state with creation, interaction and\nannihilation of optical vortices. Spatially periodic structures with bound\nphase lose stability to phase unbound turbulent states in complex Ginzburg-\nLandau and Swift-Hohenberg models with external driving. When the pumping is\nhigh and the external driving is low, synchronized oscillations are unstable\nand lead to spatio-temporal turbulence with high excursions in amplitude.\nNonlinear amplification leads to rogue waves close to turbulent optical\nvortices, where the amplitude tends to zero, and to probability distribution\nfunctions with long tails typical of extreme optical events.\n", "  We explore a plausible mechanism that the hemispherical power asymmetry in\nthe CMB is produced by the spatial variation of the primordial sound speed\nparameter. We suggest that in a generalized approach of the $\\delta N$\nformalism the local e-folding number may depend on some other primordial\nparameters besides the initial values of inflaton. Here the $\\delta N$\nformalism is extended by considering the effects of a spatially varying sound\nspeed parameter caused by a super-Hubble perturbation of a light field. Using\nthis generalized $\\delta N$ formalism, we systematically calculate the\nasymmetric primordial spectrum in the model of multi-speed inflation by taking\ninto account the constraints of primordial non-Gaussianities. We further\ndiscuss specific model constraints, and the corresponding asymmetry amplitudes\nare found to be scale-dependent, which can accommodate current observations of\nthe power asymmetry at different length scales.\n", "  We study the strong coupling between photons and atoms that can be achieved\nin an optical nanofiber geometry when the interaction is dispersive. While the\nPurcell enhancement factor for spontaneous emission into the guided mode does\nnot reach the strong-coupling regime for individual atoms, one can obtain high\ncooperativity for ensembles of a few thousand atoms due to the tight\nconfinement of the guided modes and constructive interference over the entire\nchain of trapped atoms. We calculate the dyadic Green's function, which\ndetermines the scattering of light by atoms in the presence of the fiber, and\nthus the phase shift and polarization rotation induced on the guided light by\nthe trapped atoms. The Green's function is related to a full\nHeisenberg-Langevin treatment of the dispersive response of the quantized field\nto tensor polarizable atoms. We apply our formalism to quantum nondemolition\n(QND) measurement of the atoms via polarimetry. We study shot-noise-limited\ndetection of atom number for atoms in a completely mixed spin state and the\nsqueezing of projection noise for atoms in clock states. Compared with\nsqueezing of atomic ensembles in free space, we capitalize on unique features\nthat arise in the nanofiber geometry including anisotropy of both the intensity\nand polarization of the guided modes. We use a first principles stochastic\nmaster equation to model the squeezing as function of time in the presence of\ndecoherence due to optical pumping. We find a peak metrological squeezing of ~5\ndB is achievable with current technology for ~2500 atoms trapped 180 nm from\nthe surface of a nanofiber with radius a=225 nm.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to prove central limit theorems with respect to the\nannealed measure for the magnetization rescaled by $\\sqrt{N}$ of Ising models\non random graphs. More precisely, we consider the general rank-1 inhomogeneous\nrandom graph (or generalized random graph), the 2-regular configuration model\nand the configuration model with degrees 1 and 2. For the generalized random\ngraph, we first show the existence of a finite annealed inverse critical\ntemperature $0 \\leq \\beta^{\\mathrm \\scriptscriptstyle an}_c < \\infty$ and then\nprove our results in the uniqueness regime, i.e., the values of inverse\ntemperature $\\beta$ and external magnetic field $B$ for which either $\\beta <\n\\beta^{\\mathrm \\scriptscriptstyle an}_c$ and $B=0$, or $\\beta>0$ and $B \\neq\n0$. In the case of the configuration model, the central limit theorem holds in\nthe whole region of the parameters $\\beta$ and $B$, because phase transitions\ndo not exist for these systems as they are closely related to one-dimensional\nIsing models. Our proofs are based on explicit computations that are possible\nsince the Ising model on the generalized random graph in the annealed setting\nis reduced to an inhomogeneous Curie-Weiss model, while the analysis of the\nconfiguration model with degrees only taking values 1 and 2 relies on that of\nthe classical one-dimensional Ising model.\n", "  One long-standing difficult problem in quantum dissipative dynamics is to\nsolve the spin-boson model in a non-Markovian regime where a tractable\nsystematic master equation does not exist. The spin-boson model is particularly\nimportant due to its crucial applications in quantum noise control and\nmanipulation as well as its central role in developing quantum theories of open\nsystems. Here we solve this important model by developing a non-Markovian\nquantum Langevin approach. By projecting the quantum Langevin equation onto the\ncoherent states of the bath, we can derivie a set of non-Markovian quantum\nBloch equations containing no explicit noise variables. This special feature\noffers a tremendous advantage over the existing stochastic Schr\\\"odinger\nequations in numerical simulations. The physical significance and generality of\nour approach are briefly discussed.\n", "  We present an extensive Monte Carlo study on light transport in optically\nthin slabs, addressing both axial and transverse propagation. We completely\ncharacterize the so-called ballistic-to-diffusive transition, notably in terms\nof the spatial variance of the transmitted/reflected profile. We test the\nvalidity of the prediction cast by diffusion theory, that the spatial variance\nshould grow independently of absorption and, to a first approximation, of the\nsample thickness and refractive index contrast. Based on a large set of\nsimulated data, we build a freely available look-up table routine allowing\nreliable and precise determination of the microscopic transport parameters\nstarting from robust observables which are independent of absolute intensity\nmeasurements. We also present the Monte Carlo software package that was\ndeveloped for the purpose of this study.\n", "  The $t\\!\\!-\\!\\!J$ Hamiltonian is one of the cornerstones in the theoretical\nstudy of strongly correlated copper-oxide based materials. Using the density\nmatrix renormalization group method we calculate the phase diagram of the\none-dimensional (1D) $t\\!\\!-\\!\\!J$ chain in the presence of a periodic hopping\nmodulation, as a prototype of coupled-segment models. While in the uniform 1D\n$t\\!\\!-\\!\\!J$ model near half-filling superconducting (SC) state dominates only\nat unphysically large values of the exchange coupling constant $J/t>3$, we show\nthat a small hopping and exchange modulation very strongly reduces the critical\ncoupling to be as low as $J/t\\sim1/3$ -- well within the physical regime. The\nphase diagram as a function of the electron filling also exhibits metallic,\ninsulating line phases and regions of phase separation. We suggest that a SC\nstate is easily stabilized if $t\\!\\!-\\!\\!J$ segments creating local\nspin-singlet pairing are coupled to each other -- another example is ladder\nsystem.\n", "  Motivated by the recent emergence of a new class of anisotropic 2D materials,\nwe examine their electromagnetic modes and demonstrate that a broad class of\nthe materials can host highly directional hyperbolic plasmons. Their\npropagation direction can be manipulated on-the-spot by gate doping, enabling\nhyperbolic beams reflection, refraction and bending. The realization of these\nnatural 2D hyperbolic media opens up a new avenue in dynamic control of\nhyperbolic plasmons not possible in the 3D version.\n", "  We study the charmed meson pair (${\\bar D}^0 D^0$ and $D^- D^+$) production\nin ${\\bar p}p$ annihilation within an effective Lagrangian model that has only\nthe baryon-meson degrees of freedom and involves the physical hadron masses.\nThe reaction amplitudes include terms corresponding to the t-channel\n$\\Lambda_c^+$, $\\Sigma_c^+$ and $\\Sigma_c^{++}$ baryon exchanges and the\ns-channel excitation, propagation and decay of the $\\Psi$(3770) resonance into\nthe charmed mesons. The initial- and final-state distortion effects have been\naccounted for by using a simple eikonal approximation-based procedure in the\nsame way as was done in our previous study of the ${\\bar p}p \\to {\\bar\n\\Lambda}_c^-\\Lambda_c^+$ reaction within a similar model. The ${\\bar D}^0 D^0$\nproduction reaction is dominated by the $\\Lambda_c^+$ baryon exchange process,\nand the corresponding total cross sections are predicted to be in the range of\n0.18 - 0.7 $\\mu$b for antiproton beam momenta varying between threshold and 20\n$GeV/c$. The $\\Psi$(3770) resonance contributions have a large influence on the\ndifferential cross sections of the $D^- D^+$ production reaction.\n", "  Surface codes have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information\nprocessing. Building on the previous idea to realize the physical qubits of\nsuch systems in terms of Majorana bound states supported by topological\nsemiconductor nanowires, we show that the basic code operations, namely\nprojective stabilizer measurements and qubit manipulations, can be implemented\nby conventional tunnel conductance probes and charge pumping via\nsingle-electron transistors, respectively. The simplicity of the access scheme\nsuggests that a functional code might be in close experimental reach.\n", "  The present paper shows that general relativity in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner\nformalism admits a BV-BFV formulation. More precisely, for any $d + 1 \\not= 2$\n(pseudo-) Riemannian manifold M with space-like or time-like boundary\ncomponents, the BV data on the bulk induces compatible BFV data on the\nboundary. As a byproduct, the usual canonical formulation of general relativity\nis recovered in a straightforward way.\n", "  We calculate, by means of fluctuational electrodynamics, the thermal emission\nof an aperture filled by vacuum or a material at temperature T. We show that\nthermal emission is very different whether the aperture size is large or small\ncompared to the thermal wavelength. Subwavelength apertures filled with vacuum\n(subwavelength blackbody) have their thermal emission strongly decreased\ncompared to classical blackbodies. A simple expression of their emissivity can\nbe calculated and their total emittance scales as T 8 instead of T 4 for large\napertures. Thermal emission of disk of materials with a size comparable to the\nwavelength is also discussed. It is shown in particular that emissivity of such\na disk is increased when the material can support surface waves such as phonon\npolaritons.\n", "  We examine the momentum dependence of $\\bar p$$p$ and $\\bar n$$p$\nannihilation cross sections by considering the transmission through a nuclear\npotential and the $\\bar p p$ Coulomb interaction. Compared to the $\\bar n p$\nannihilation cross section, the $\\bar p p$ annihilation cross section is\nsignificantly enhanced by the Coulomb interaction for projectile momenta below\n$p_{\\rm lab} <$ 500 MeV/$c$, and the two annihilation cross sections approach\nthe Pomeranchuk's equality limit [JETP Lett. {\\bb 30}, 423 (1956)] at $p_{\\rm\nlab}\\sim 500$ MeV/$c$. Using these elementary cross sections as the basic input\ndata, the extended Glauber model is employed to evaluate the annihilation cross\nsections for $\\bar n$ and $\\bar p$ interaction with nuclei and the results\ncompare well with experimental data.\n", "  We test the validity of cosmic censorship in the rotating anti-de Sitter\nblack hole. For this purpose, we investigate whether the extremal black hole\ncan be overspun by the particle absorption. The particle absorption will change\nthe mass and angular momentum of the black hole, which is analyzed using the\nHamilton-Jacobi equations consistent with the laws of thermodynamics. We have\nfound that the mass of the extremal black hole increases more than the angular\nmomentum. Therefore, the outer horizon of the black hole still exists, and\ncosmic censorship is valid.\n", "  While strong topological insulators (STI) have been experimentally realized\nsoon after their theoretical predictions, a weak topological insulator (WTI)\nhas yet to be unambiguously confirmed. A major obstacle is the lack of distinct\nnatural cleavage surfaces to test the surface selective hallmark of WTI. With a\nnew scheme, we discover that Bi$_{4}$X$_{4}$ (X=Br, I), stable or synthesized\nbefore, can be WTI with two natural cleavage surfaces, where two anisotropic\nDirac cones stabilize and annihilate, respectively. We further find four\nsurface state Lifshitz transitions under charge doping and two bulk topological\nphase transitions under uniaxial strain. Near the WTI-STI transition, there\nemerges a novel Weyl semimetal phase, in which the Fermi arcs generically\nappear at both cleavage surfaces whereas the Fermi circle only appears at one\nselected surface.\n", "  Phase transitions in the Hubbard model and ionic Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling on the honeycomb lattice are investigated in the strong coupling\nperturbation theory which corresponds to an expansion in powers of the hopping\n$t$ around the atomic limit. Within this formulation we find analytic\nexpressions for the single-particle spectrum, whereby the calculation of the\ninsulating gap is reduced to a simple root finding problem. This enables high\nprecision determination of the insulating gap that does not require any\nextrapolation procedure. The critical value of Mott transition on the honeycomb\nlattice is obtained to be $U_c\\approx 2.38 t$. Studying the ionic Hubbard model\nat the lowest order, we find two insulating states, one with Mott character at\nlarge $U$ and another with single-particle gap character at large ionic\npotential, $\\Delta$. The present approach gives a critical gapless state at\n$U=2\\Delta$ at lowest order. By systematically improving on the perturbation\nexpansion, the density of states around this critical gapless phase reduces.\n", "  Self-dual Yang-Mills instantons on $R^4$ correspond to algebraic ADHM data.\nThe ADHM equations for $S^1$-symmetric instantons give a one-dimensional\nintegrable lattice system, which may be viewed as an discretization of the Nahm\nequations. In this note, we see that generalized ADHM data for $T^2$-symmetric\ninstantons gives an integrable two-dimensional lattice system, which may be\nviewed as a discrete version of the Hitchin equations.\n", "  The decay $B^0\\to \\psi(2S) K^+\\pi^-$ is analyzed using $\\rm 3~fb^{-1}$ of\n$pp$ collision data collected with the LHCb detector. A model-independent\ndescription of the $\\psi(2S) \\pi$ mass spectrum is obtained, using as input the\n$K\\pi$ mass spectrum and angular distribution derived directly from data,\nwithout requiring a theoretical description of resonance shapes or their\ninterference. The hypothesis that the $\\psi(2S)\\pi$ mass spectrum can be\ndescribed in terms of $K\\pi$ reflections alone is rejected with more than\n8$\\sigma$ significance. This provides confirmation, in a model-independent way,\nof the need for an additional resonant component in the mass region of the\n$Z(4430)^-$ exotic state.\n", "  We report the higher order cumulants and their ratios for baryon, charge and\nstrangeness multiplicity in canonical and grand-canonical ensembles in ideal\nthermal model including all the resonances. When the number of conserved quanta\nis small, an explicit treatment of these conserved charges is required, which\nleads to a canonical description of the system and the fluctuations are\nsignificantly different from the grand canonical ensemble. Cumulant ratios of\ntotal charge and net-charge multiplicity as a function of collision energies\nare also compared in grand canonical ensemble.\n", "  We obtain the thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly\ncoupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at both zero and nonzero baryon chemical\npotential using a bottom-up Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) holographic model\nthat is in good quantitative agreement with the thermodynamics of\n$(2+1)$-flavor lattice QCD around the crossover transition for baryon chemical\npotentials up to 400 MeV, which may be reached in the beam energy scan (BES) at\nRHIC. We find that increasing the temperature $T$ and the baryon chemical\npotential $\\mu_B$ enhances the peak present in both spectra. We also obtain the\nelectric charge susceptibility, the DC and AC electric conductivities and the\nelectric charge diffusion as functions of $T$ and $\\mu_B$. We find that\nelectric diffusive transport is suppressed as one increases $\\mu_B$. At zero\nbaryon density, we compare our results for the DC electric conductivity and the\nelectric charge diffusion with the latest lattice data available for these\nobservables and find reasonable agreement around the crossover transition.\nTherefore, our holographic results may be used to constraint the magnitude of\nthe thermal photon and dilepton production rates in a strongly coupled QGP,\nwhich we found to be at least one order of magnitude below perturbative\nestimates.\n", "  We give a survey of the long-time asymptotics for the Toda lattice with\nsteplike constant initial data using the nonlinear steepest descent analysis\nand its extension based on a suitably chosen $g$-function. Analytic formulas\nfor the leading term of the asymptotic solutions of the Toda shock and\nrarefaction problems (including the case of overlapping background spectra) are\ngiven and complemented by numerical simulations. We provide an explicit formula\nfor the modulated solution in terms of Abelian integrals on the underlying\nhyperelliptic Riemann surface.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of spin-orbit (SO) coupling for spin-1\nultracold atoms opens an interesting avenue for exploring SO-coupling-related\nphysics in large-spin systems, which is generally unattainable in electronic\nmaterials. In this paper, we study the effects of interactions between atoms on\nthe ground states and collective excitations of SO-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) in the presence of a spin-tensor potential. We find that\nferromagnetic interaction between atoms can induce a stripe phase exhibiting\nin-phase or out-of-phase modulating patterns between spin-tensor and\nzero-spin-component density waves. We characterize the phase transitions\nbetween different phases using the spin-tensor density as well as the\ncollective dipole motion of the BEC. We show that there exists a double\nmaxon-roton structure in the Bogoliubov-excitation spectrum, attributed to the\nthree band minima of the SO-coupled spin-1 BEC.\n", "  Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of\nfundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and\nthat of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in\nclusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent\nspectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any\nspecific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is\nthat it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members\ndue to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a\nnovel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests\nthis one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra,\nrather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally\ndone. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and\nNGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for\neach cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate\nBayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of\n15 elements: <0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, <~0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg,\nSi, and Ni, <~0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and <~0.03 (0.05) dex for Na,\nS, K, Ti, and V (at 68% and 95% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on\nC and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred\nduring star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within <~6\nMyr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of\ndifferential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic\nsurveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical\nenrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.\n", "  We report circularly-polarized optical reflection spectroscopy of monolayer\nWS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ at low temperatures (4~K) and in high magnetic fields to\n65~T. Both the A and the B exciton transitions exhibit a clear and very similar\nZeeman splitting of approximately $-$230~$\\mu$eV/T ($g\\simeq -4$), providing\nthe first measurements of the valley Zeeman effect and associated $g$-factors\nin monolayer transition-metal disulphides. These results complement and are\ncompared with recent low-field photoluminescence measurements of valley\ndegeneracy breaking in the monolayer diselenides MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$. Further,\nthe very large magnetic fields used in our studies allows us to observe the\nsmall quadratic diamagnetic shifts of the A and B excitons in monolayer WS$_2$\n(0.32 and 0.11~$\\mu$eV/T$^2$, respectively), from which we calculate exciton\nradii of 1.53~nm and 1.16~nm. When analyzed within a model of non-local\ndielectric screening in monolayer semiconductors, these diamagnetic shifts also\nconstrain and provide estimates of the exciton binding energies (410~meV and\n470~meV for the A and B excitons, respectively), further highlighting the\nutility of high magnetic fields for understanding new 2D materials.\n", "  We demonstrate humidity sensing using a change of electrical resistance of a\nsingle- layer chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene that is placed on top of\na SiO2 layer on a Si wafer. To investigate the selectivity of the sensor\ntowards the most common constituents in air, its signal response was\ncharacterized individually for water vapor (H2O), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2),\nand argon (Ar). In order to assess the humidity sensing effect for a range from\n1% relative humidity (RH) to 96% RH, devices were characterized both in a\nvacuum chamber and in a humidity chamber at atmospheric pressure. The measured\nresponse and recovery times of the graphene humidity sensors are on the order\nof several hundred milliseconds. Density functional theory simulations are\nemployed to further investigate the sensitivity of the graphene devices towards\nwater vapor. Results from the interaction between the electrostatic dipole\nmoment of the water and the impurity bands in the SiO2 substrate, which in turn\nleads to electrostatic doping of the graphene layer. The proposed graphene\nsensor provides rapid response direct electrical read out and is compatible\nwith back end of the line (BEOL) integration on top of CMOS-based integrated\ncircuits.\n", "  We present a science forecast for the eBOSS survey, part of the SDSS-IV\nproject, which is a spectroscopic survey using multiple tracers of large-scale\nstructure, including luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission line galaxies\n(ELGs) and quasars (both as a direct probe of structure and through the\nLy-$\\alpha$ forest). Focusing on discrete tracers, we forecast the expected\naccuracy of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO), the redshift-space\ndistortion (RSD) measurements, the $f_{\\rm NL}$ parameter quantifying the\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, the dark energy and modified gravity parameters. We\nalso use the line-of-sight clustering in the Ly-$\\alpha$ forest to constrain\nthe total neutrino mass. We find that eBOSS LRGs ($0.6<z<1.0$) (combined with\nthe BOSS LRGs at $z>0.6$), ELGs ($0.6<z<1.2$) and Clustering Quasars (CQs)\n($0.6<z<2.2$) can achieve a precision of 1%, 2.2% and 1.6% precisions,\nrespectively, for spherically averaged BAO distance measurements. Using the\nsame samples, the constraint on $f\\sigma_8$ is expected to be 2.5%, 3.3% and\n2.8% respectively. For primordial non-Gaussianity, eBOSS alone can reach an\naccuracy of $\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL})\\sim10-15$, depending on the external\nmeasurement of the galaxy bias and our ability to model large-scale systematic\nerrors. eBOSS can at most improve the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) by a\nfactor of $3$ for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation, and can\nwell constrain three eigenmodes for the general equation-of-state parameter\n(Abridged).\n", "  Participation in conferences is an important part of every scientific career.\nConferences provide an opportunity for a fast dissemination of latest results,\ndiscussion and exchange of ideas, and broadening of scientists' collaboration\nnetwork. The decision to participate in a conference depends on several factors\nlike the location, cost, popularity of keynote speakers, and the scientists'\nassociation with the community. Here we discuss and formulate the problem of\ndiscovering how a scientists' previous participation affects her/his future\nparticipations in the same conference series. We develop a stochastic model to\nexamine scientists' participation patterns in conferences and compare our model\nwith data from six conferences across various scientific fields and\ncommunities. Our model shows that the probability for a scientist to\nparticipate in a given conference series strongly depends on the balance\nbetween the number of participations and non-participations during his/her\nearly connections with the community. An active participation in a conference\nseries strengthens the scientists' association with that particular conference\ncommunity and thus increases the probability of future participations.\n", "  The phenomenon of low-temperature spin Coulomb drag in a two-dimensional\nelectron gas is investigated. The spin transresistivity coefficient is\nessentially enhanced in the diffusive regime, as compared to conventional\npredictions. The origin of this enhancement is the quantum coherence of spin-up\nand spin-down electrons propagating in the same random impurity potential and\ncoupled via the Coulomb interaction. A comprehensive analysis of spin and\ninterlayer Coulomb drag effects is presented.\n", "  The Double Chooz collaboration presents a measurement of the neutrino mixing\nangle $\\theta_{13}$ using reactor $\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ observed via the inverse\nbeta decay reaction in which the neutron is captured on hydrogen. This\nmeasurement is based on 462.72 live days data, approximately twice as much data\nas in the previous such analysis, collected with a detector positioned at an\naverage distance of 1050m from two reactor cores. Several novel techniques have\nbeen developed to achieve significant reductions of the backgrounds and\nsystematic uncertainties. Accidental coincidences, the dominant background in\nthis analysis, are suppressed by more than an order of magnitude with respect\nto our previous publication by a multi-variate analysis. These improvements\ndemonstrate the capability of precise measurement of reactor\n$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ without gadolinium loading. Spectral distortions from the\n$\\overline{\\nu}_{e}$ reactor flux predictions previously reported with the\nneutron capture on gadolinium events are confirmed in the independent data\nsample presented here. A value of $\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{13} =\n0.095^{+0.038}_{-0.039}$(stat+syst) is obtained from a fit to the observed\nevent rate as a function of the reactor power, a method insensitive to the\nenergy spectrum shape. A simultaneous fit of the hydrogen capture events and of\nthe gadolinium capture events yields a measurement of $\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{13} =\n0.088\\pm0.033$(stat+syst).\n", "  In this paper, we study the Starobinsky model of inflation in the context of\ngravity's rainbow theory. We propose that gravity rainbow functions can be\nwritten in the power-law form of the Hubble parameter. We present a detailed\nderivation of the spectral index of curvature perturbation and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and compare the predictions of our models with Planck\n2015 data. We discover that in order to be consistent with Planck data up to\n$2\\sigma$ C.L., the viable values of $N_{k}$ $e$-folds would satisfy\n$42\\lesssim N_{k}\\lesssim 87$ and the rainbow parameter $\\lambda$ is nicely\nconstrained to be $\\lambda \\lesssim6.0$.\n", "  Hyperentanglement, the entanglement in several degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a\nquantum system, has attracted much attention as it can be used to increase both\nthe channel capacity of quantum communication and its security largely. Here,\nwe present the first scheme to completely distinguish the hyperentangled Bell\nstates of two-photon systems in three DOFs with the help of cross-Kerr\nnonlinearity without destruction, including two longitudinal momentum DOFs and\nthe polarization DOF. We use cross-Kerr nonlinearity to construct quantum\nnondemolition detectors which can be used to make a parity-check measurement\nand analyze Bell states of two-photon systems in different DOFs. Our complete\nscheme for two-photon six-qubit hyperentangled Bell-state analysis may be\nuseful for the practical applications in quantum information, especially in\nlong-distance high-capacity quantum communication.\n", "  We wish to construct a minimal set of algebraically independent scalar\ncurvature invariants formed by the contraction of the Riemann (Ricci) tensor\nand its covariant derivatives up to some order of differentiation in three\ndimensional (3D) Lorentzian spacetimes. In order to do this we utilize the\nCartan-Karlhede equivalence algorithm since, in general, all Cartan invariants\nare related to scalar polynomial curvature invariants. As an example we apply\nthe algorithm to the class of 3D Szekeres cosmological spacetimes with comoving\ndust and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. In this case, we find that there are\nat most twelve algebraically independent Cartan invariants, including\n$\\Lambda$. We present these Cartan invariants, and we relate them to twelve\nindependent scalar polynomial curvature invariants (two, four and six,\nrespectively, zeroth, first, and second order scalar polynomial curvature\ninvariants).\n", "  We propose a new possible explanation of the ATLAS di-boson excess: that it\nis due to heavy resonant slepton production, followed by decay into di-smuons.\nThe smuon has a mass not too far from the W and Z masses, and so it is easily\nconfused with W or Z bosons after its subsequent decay into di-jets, through a\nsupersymmetry violating and R-parity violating interaction. Such a scenario is\nnot currently excluded by other constraints and remains to be definitively\ntested in Run II of the LHC. Such light smuons can easily simultaneously\nexplain the discrepancy between the measurement of the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon and the Standard Model prediction.\n", "  The noninertial effect of rotating frames on the quantum dynamics of scalar\nbosons embedded in the background of a cosmic string is considered. In this\nwork, scalar bosons are described by the Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP)\nformalism. Considering the DKP oscillator in this background the combined\neffects of a rotating frames and cosmic string on the equation of motion,\nenergy spectrum and DKP spinor are analyzed and discussed in detail.\nAdditionally, the effect of rotating frames on the scalar bosons localization\nis studied.\n", "  Superfluids under an intense gravitational field are typically found in\ncompact stellar cores. Most treatments of these superfluids, however, are done\nusing a flat spacetime background. In this paper, the effect of spacetime\ncurvature on relativistic superfluids is investigated. The scalar-field\nsuperfluid in a background metric of a typical star core is considered first.\nIt is found that the superfluid formed inside a compact object can not be of\nspherical shape. Explicit numerical calculation of the gravitational correction\nto the superfluid order parameter is performed for two specific examples with\ndifferent boundary conditions. It is found that even in the weak-gravity limit,\ngravity can have a significant effect on superfluidity. The relativistic\nsuperfluids formed by various fermion pairings are also considered. Two\npossible cases are considered in the mean-field treatment: antifermion-fermion\nand fermion-fermion pairings. The effective actions and the self-consistent\nequations are derived for both cases. An analytical expression for the\nfirst-order gravitational correction to the superfluid order parameter is given\nfor the antifermion-fermion pairing; while, the analytical expressions for the\nmatrix elements of the heat kernel operator, which is useful in\ncurved-spacetime QFT calculations, is derived for the fermion-fermion pairing.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the generation of atom-light entanglement via\nRaman superradiance in an optical cavity, and show how this can be used to\nenhance the sensitivity of atom interferometry. We model a realistic optical\ncavity, and show that by careful temporal shaping of the optical local\noscillator used to measure the light emitted from the cavity, information in\nthe optical mode can be combined with the signal from the atom interferometer\nto reduce the quantum noise, and thus increase the sensitivity. It was found in\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 110, 053002 (2013) that an atomic `seed' was required in order\nto reduce spontaneous emission and allow for single mode behaviour of the\ndevice. In this paper we find that the optical cavity reduces the need for an\natomic seed, which allows for stronger atom-light correlations and a greater\nlevel of quantum enhancement.\n", "  We report a systematic study of coherent spin precession and spin dephasing\nin electron-doped monolayer MoS$_2$. Using time-resolved Kerr rotation\nspectroscopy and applied in-plane magnetic fields, a nanosecond-timescale\nLarmor spin precession signal commensurate with $g$-factor $|g_0|\\simeq 1.86$\nis observed in several different MoS$_2$ samples grown by chemical vapor\ndeposition. The dephasing rate of this oscillatory signal increases linearly\nwith magnetic field, suggesting that the coherence arises from a sub-ensemble\nof localized electron spins having an inhomogeneously-broadened distribution of\n$g$-factors, $g_0 + \\Delta g$. In contrast to $g_0$, $\\Delta g$ is\nsample-dependent and ranges from 0.042 to 0.115.\n", "  There are various no-go results forbidding self-interactions for a single\npartially massless spin-2 field. Given the photon-like structure of the linear\npartially massless field, it is natural to ask whether a multiplet of such\nfields can interact under an internal Yang-Mills like extension of the\npartially massless symmetry. We give two arguments that such a partially\nmassless Yang-Mills theory does not exist. The first is that there is no\nYang-Mills like non-abelian deformation of the partially massless symmetry, and\nthe second is that cubic vertices with the appropriate structure constants do\nnot exist.\n", "  The coherent quantum dynamics of a single bosonic spin variable, subject to a\nconstraint derived from the quantum spherical model of a ferromagnet, and\ncoupled to an external heat bath, is studied through the Lindblad equation for\nthe reduced density matrix. Closed systems of equations of motion for several\nquantum observables are derived and solved exactly. The relationship to the\nsingle-mode Dicke model from quantum optics is discussed. The analysis of the\ninterplay of the quantum fluctuation and the dissipation and their influence on\nthe relaxation of the time-dependent magnetisation leads to the distinction of\nqualitatively different regimes of weak and strong quantum couplings.\nConsidering the model's behaviour in an external field as a simple mean-field\napproximation of the dynamics of a quantum spherical ferromagnet, the magnetic\nphase diagramme appears to be re-entrant and presents a quantum analogue of\nwell-established classical examples of fluctuation-induced order.\n", "  This paper presents an analysis of electron-ion recombination processes in\nionization tracks of recoiled atoms in liquid argon (LAr) detectors. The\nanalysis is based on the results of computer simulations which use realistic\nmodels of electron transport and reactions. The calculations reproduce the\nrecent experimental results of the ionization yield from 6.7 keV nuclear\nrecoils in LAr. The statistical distribution of the number of electrons that\nescape recombination is found to deviate from the binomial distribution, and\nestimates of recombination fluctuations for nuclear recoils tracks are\nobtained. A study of the recombination kinetics shows that a significant part\nof electrons undergo very fast static recombination, an effect that may be\nresponsible for the weak drift-field dependence of the ionization yield from\nnuclear recoils in some noble liquids. The obtained results can be useful in\nthe search for hypothetical dark matter particles and in other studies that\ninvolve detection of recoiled nuclei.\n", "  We investigate the effect of charge carrier interaction with surface optical\nphonons on the band properties of monolayer black phosphorus induced by polar\nsubstrates. We develop an analytical method based on the Lee-Low-Pines theory\nto calculate the spectrum of Fr\\\"ohlich type continuum Hamiltonian in the\nlong-wavelength limit. We examine the modification of a band gap and\nrenormalization of effective masses due to the substrate-related polaronic\neffect. Our results show that an energy gap in supported monolayer black\nphosphorus is enlarged depending on a particular substrate and the interlayer\ndistance, $z$. Among the substrate considered, the largest gap broadening at $\nz=2.5$ \\AA{} is observed for the Al$_{2} $O$_{3} $ substrate, which is found to\nbe $ \\sim 50$ meV. Carrier-phonon coupling also renormalizes the effective\nmasses which is more pronounced along the zigzag direction. Anisotropy of the\neffective masses becomes stronger by the influence of the polaronic effect\ncorresponding to direction-dependent carrier-phonon coupling. We conclude that\nsubstrate phonons have a non-negligible effect on the static band properties of\nmonolayer black phosphorus, which may be further exploited in its experimental\nand theoretical studies.\n", "  The development and implementation of increasingly accurate methods for\nelectronic structure calculations mean that, for many atomistic simulation\nproblems, treating light nuclei as classical particles is now one of the most\nserious approximations. Even though recent developments have significantly\nreduced the overhead for modelling the quantum nature of the nuclei, the cost\nis still prohibitive when combined with advanced electronic structure methods.\nHere we present how multiple time step integrators can be combined with\nring-polymer contraction techniques (effectively, multiple time stepping in\nimaginary time) to reduce virtually to zero the overhead of modelling nuclear\nquantum effects, while describing inter-atomic forces at high levels of\nelectronic structure theory. This is demonstrated for a combination of MP2 and\nsemi-local DFT applied to the Zundel cation. The approach can be seamlessly\ncombined with other methods to reduce the computational cost of path integral\ncalculations, such as high-order factorizations of the Boltzmann operator, or\ngeneralized Langevin equation thermostats.\n", "  The microscopic wave functions of the composite fermion theory can\nincorporate electron mass anisotropy by a trivial rescaling of the coordinates.\nThese wave functions are very likely adiabatically connected to the actual wave\nfunctions of the anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states. We show in this\narticle that they possess the nice property that their energies can be\nanalytically related to the previously calculated energies for the isotropic\nstates through a universal scale factor, thus allowing an estimation of several\nobservables in the thermodynamic limit for all fractional quantum Hall states.\nThe rather weak dependence of the scale factor on the anisotropy provides\ninsight into why fractional quantum Hall effect and composite fermions are\nquite robust to electron mass anisotropy. We discuss how better, though still\napproximate, wave functions can be obtained by introducing a variational\nparameter, following Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 107}, 116801 (2011)], but\nthe resulting wave functions are not readily amenable to calculations. Our\nconsiderations are also applicable, with minimal modification, to the case\nwhere the dielectric function of the background material is anisotropic.\n", "  We present results of the first ab initio lattice QCD calculation of the\nnormalization constants and first moments of the leading twist distribution\namplitudes of the full baryon octet, corresponding to the small transverse\ndistance limit of the associated S-wave light-cone wave functions. The P-wave\n(higher twist) normalization constants are evaluated as well. The calculation\nis done using $N_f=2+1$ flavors of dynamical (clover) fermions on lattices of\ndifferent volumes and pion masses down to 222 MeV. Significant SU(3) flavor\nsymmetry violation effects in the shape of the distribution amplitudes are\nobserved.\n", "  We examine the carrier density dependence of the scattering rate in two- and\nthree-dimensional electron liquids in SrTiO3 in the regime where it scales with\nT^n (T is the temperature and n <= 2) in the cases when it is varied by\nelectrostatic control and chemical doping, respectively. It is shown that the\nscattering rate is independent of the carrier density. This is contrary to the\nexpectations from Landau Fermi liquid theory, where the scattering rate scales\ninversely with the Fermi energy (E_F). We discuss that the behavior is very\nsimilar to systems traditionally identified as non-Fermi liquids (n < 2). This\nincludes the cuprates and other transition metal oxide perovskites, where\nstrikingly similar density-independent scattering rates have been observed. The\nresults indicate that the applicability of Fermi liquid theory should be\nquestioned for a much broader range of correlated materials and point to the\nneed for a unified theory.\n", "  We prove that the squared R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement (SR$\\alpha$E),\nwhich is the generalization of entanglement of formation (EOF), obeys a general\nmonogamy inequality in an arbitrary $N$-qubit mixed state. Furthermore, for a\nclass of R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement, we prove that the monogamy relations\nof the SR$\\alpha$E have a hierarchical structure when the $N$-qubit system is\ndivided into $k$ parties. As a byproduct, the analytical relation between the\nR\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement and the squared concurrence is derived for\nbipartite $2\\otimes d$ systems. Based on the monogamy properties of\nSR$\\alpha$E, we can construct the corresponding multipartite entanglement\nindicators which still work well even when the indicators based on the squared\nconcurrence and EOF lose their efficacy. In addition, the monogamy property of\nthe $\\mu$-th power of R\\'{e}nyi-$\\alpha$ entanglement is analyzed.\n", "  We consider systems of local variational problems defining non vanishing\ncohomolgy classes. In particular, we prove that the conserved current\nassociated with a generalized symmetry, assumed to be also a symmetry of the\nvariation of the corresponding local inverse problem, is variationally\nequivalent to the variation of the strong Noether current for the corresponding\nlocal system of Lagrangians. This current is conserved and a sufficient\ncondition will be identified in order such a current be global.\n", "  The $\\Delta(1232) \\to \\gamma^\\ast N$ magnetic dipole form factor ($G_M^\\ast$)\nis described here within a new covariant model that combines the valence quark\ncore together with the pion cloud contributions. The pion cloud term is\nparameterized by two terms: one connected to the pion electromagnetic form\nfactor, the other to the photon interaction with intermediate baryon states.\nThe model can be used in studies of pp and heavy ion collisions. In the\ntimelike region this new model improves the results obtained with a constant\nform factor model fixed at its value at zero momentum transfer. At the same\ntime, and in contrast to the Iachello model, this new model predicts a peak for\nthe transition form factor at the expected position, i.e. at the $\\rho$ mass\npole. We calculate the decay of the $\\Delta \\to \\gamma N$ transition, the\nDalitz decay ($\\Delta \\to e^+ e^- N$), and the $\\Delta$ mass distribution\nfunction. The impact of the model on dilepton spectra in pp collisions is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Deformation quantization conventionally is described in terms of\nmultidifferential operators. Jet manifold technique is well-known provide the\nadequate formulation of theory of differential operators. We extended this\nformulation to the multidifferential ones, and consider their infinite order\njet prolongation. The infinite order jet manifold is endowed with the canonical\nflat connection that provides the covariant formula of a deformation\nstar-product.\n", "  Based on a fact that complex Clifford algebras of even dimension are\nisomorphic to the matrix ones, we consider bundles in Clifford algebras whose\nstructure group is a general linear group acting on a Clifford algebra by left\nmultiplications, but not a group of its automorphisms. It is essential that\nsuch a Clifford algebra bundle contains spinor subbundles, and that it can be\nassociated to a tangent bundle over a smooth manifold. This is just the case of\ngravitation theory. However, different these bundles need not be isomorphic. To\ncharacterize all of them, we follow the technique of composite bundles. In\ngravitation theory, this technique enables us to describe different types of\nspinor fields in the presence of general linear connections and under general\ncovariant transformations.\n", "  We use Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) data from Y. Wang (2008) to put additional\nconstraints on a set of cosmological dark energy models based on the\nholographic principle. GRBs are among the most complex and energetic\nastrophysical events known in the universe offering us the opportunity to\nobtain information from the history of cosmic expansion up to about redshift of\n$z\\sim 6$. These astrophysical objects provide us a complementary observational\ntest to determine the nature of dark energy by complementing the information of\ndata from Supernovas (e.g. Union 2.1 compilation). We found that the $\\Lambda\nCDM$ model gives the best fit to the observational data, although our\nstatistical analysis ($\\Delta AIC$ and $\\Delta BIC$) shows that the models\nstudied in this work (\"Hubble Radius Scale\" and \"Ricci Scale Q\") have a\nreasonable agreement with respect to the most successful, except for the \"Ricci\nScale CPL\" and \"Future Event Horizon\" models, which can be ruled out by the\npresent study. However, these results reflect the importance of GRBs\nmeasurements to provide additional observational constraints to alternative\ncosmological models, which are mandatory to clarify the way in which the\nparadigm of dark energy or any alternative model is correct.\n", "  The understanding of spin dynamics in laterally confined structures on\nsub-micron length scales has become a significant aspect of the development of\nnovel magnetic storage technologies. Numerous ferromagnetic resonance\nmeasurements, optical characterization by Kerr microscopy and Brillouin light\nscattering spectroscopy and x-ray studies were carried out to detect the\ndynamics in patterned magnetic antidot lattices. Here, we investigate\nOersted-field driven spin dynamics in rectangular Ni80Fe20/Pt antidot lattices\nwith different lattice parameters by electrical means and compare them to\nmicromagnetic simulations. When the system is driven to resonance, a dc voltage\nacross the length of the sample is detected that changes its sign upon field\nreversal, which is in agreement with a rectification mechanism based on the\ninverse spin Hall effect. Furthermore, we show that the voltage output scales\nlinearly with the applied microwave drive in the investigated range of powers.\nOur findings have direct implications on the development of engineered\nmagnonics applications and devices.\n", "  The KMOS Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS) is an ESO guaranteed time\nsurvey of 795 typical star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z=0.8-1.0\nwith the KMOS instrument on the VLT. In this paper we present resolved\nkinematics and star formation rates for 584 z~1 galaxies. This constitutes the\nlargest near-infrared Integral Field Unit survey of galaxies at z~1 to date. We\ndemonstrate the success of our selection criteria with 90% of our targets found\nto be Halpha emitters, of which 81% are spatially resolved. The fraction of the\nresolved KROSS sample with dynamics dominated by ordered rotation is found to\nbe 83$\\pm$5%. However, when compared with local samples these are turbulent\ndiscs with high gas to baryonic mass fractions, ~35%, and the majority are\nconsistent with being marginally unstable (Toomre Q~1). There is no strong\ncorrelation between galaxy averaged velocity dispersion and the total star\nformation rate, suggesting that feedback from star formation is not the origin\nof the elevated turbulence. We postulate that it is the ubiquity of high\n(likely molecular) gas fractions and the associated gravitational instabilities\nthat drive the elevated star-formation rates in these typical z~1 galaxies,\nleading to the ten-fold enhanced star-formation rate density. Finally, by\ncomparing the gas masses obtained from inverting the star-formation law with\nthe dynamical and stellar masses, we infer an average dark matter to total mass\nfraction within 2.2$r_e$ (9.5kpc) of 65$\\pm$12%, in agreement with the results\nfrom hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation.\n", "  Using spectral-line observations of HNCO, N2H+, and HNC, we investigate the\nkinematics of dense gas in the central ~250 pc of the Galaxy. We present SCOUSE\n(Semi-automated multi-COmponent Universal Spectral-line fitting Engine), a line\nfitting algorithm designed to analyse large volumes of spectral-line data\nefficiently and systematically. Unlike techniques which do not account for\ncomplex line profiles, SCOUSE accurately describes the {l, b, v_LSR}\ndistribution of CMZ gas, which is asymmetric about Sgr A* in both position and\nvelocity. Velocity dispersions range from 2.6 km/s<\\sigma<53.1 km/s. A median\ndispersion of 9.8 km/s, translates to a Mach number, M_3D>28. The gas is\ndistributed throughout several \"streams\", with projected lengths ~100-250 pc.\nWe link the streams to individual clouds and sub-regions, including Sgr C, the\n20 and 50 km/s clouds, the dust ridge, and Sgr B2. Shell-like emission features\ncan be explained by the projection of independent molecular clouds in Sgr C and\nthe newly identified conical profile of Sgr B2 in {l ,b, v_LSR} space. These\nfeatures have previously invoked supernova-driven shells and cloud-cloud\ncollisions as explanations. We instead caution against structure identification\nin velocity-integrated emission maps. Three geometries describing the 3-D\nstructure of the CMZ are investigated: i) two spiral arms; ii) a closed\nelliptical orbit; iii) an open stream. While two spiral arms and an open stream\nqualitatively reproduce the gas distribution, the most recent parameterisation\nof the closed elliptical orbit does not. Finally, we discuss how proper motion\nmeasurements of masers can distinguish between these geometries, and suggest\nthat this effort should be focused on the 20 km/s and 50 km/s clouds and Sgr C.\n", "  Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are transient events observed when a star\npasses close enough to a supermassive black hole to be tidally destroyed. Many\nTDE candidates have been discovered in host galaxies whose spectra have weak or\nno line emission yet strong Balmer line absorption, indicating a period of\nintense star formation that has recently ended. As such, TDE host galaxies fall\ninto the rare class of quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies. Here, we quantify the\nfraction of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with spectral\nproperties like those of TDE hosts, determining the extent to which TDEs are\nover-represented in such galaxies. Galaxies whose spectra have Balmer\nabsorption H$\\delta_{\\rm A}$ $-$ $\\sigma$(H$\\delta_{\\rm A}$) $>$ 4 \\AA\\ (where\n$\\sigma$(H$\\delta_{\\rm A}$) is the error in the Lick H$\\delta_{\\rm A}$ index)\nand H$\\alpha$ emission EW $<$ $3$ \\AA\\ have had a strong starburst in the last\n$\\sim$Gyr. They represent 0.2% of the local galaxy population, yet host 3 of 8\n(37.5%) optical/UV-selected TDE candidates. A broader cut, H$\\delta_{\\rm A} >$\n1.31 \\AA\\ and H$\\alpha$ EW $<$ $3$ \\AA, nets only 2.3% of SDSS galaxies, but 6\nof 8 (75%) optical/UV TDE hosts. Thus, quiescent Balmer-strong galaxies are\nover-represented among the TDE hosts by a factor of 33-190. The\nhigh-energy-selected TDE Swift J1644 also lies in a galaxy with strong Balmer\nlines and weak H$\\alpha$ emission, implying a $>80\\times$ enhancement in such\nhosts and providing an observational link between the $\\gamma$/X-ray-bright and\noptical/UV-bright TDE classes.\n", "  The detailed understanding of the physical parameters that determine\nLocalized Surface Plasmon Resonances (LSPRs) is essential to develop new\napplications for plasmonics. A relatively new area of research has been opened\nby the identification of LSPRs in low carrier density systems obtained by\ndoping semiconductor quantum dots. We investigate theoretically how diffuse\nsurface scattering of electrons in combination with the effect of quantization\ndue to size (QSE) impact the evolution of the LSPRs with the size of these\nnanosystems. Two key parameters are the length $R_0$ giving the strength of the\nQSE and the velocity $\\beta_T$ of the electronic excitations entering in the\nlength scale for diffuse surface scattering. While the QSE itself only produces\na blueshift in energy of the LSPRs, the diffuse surface scattering mechanism\ngives to both energy and linewidth an oscillatory-damped behavior as a function\nof size, with characteristic lengths that depend on material parameters. Thus,\nthe evolution of the LSPRs with size at the nanometer scale is very dependent\non the relation of size to these lengths, which we illustrate with several\nexamples. The variety of behaviors we find could be useful for designing\nplasmonic devices based on doped semiconductor nano structures having desired\nproperties.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a generic cosmological fluid described by the\nvan der Waals equation of state. Exact solutions for the energy density\nevolution are found as implicit functions of the scale factor for a flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time. The possible values of the free\nparameter in the van der Waals equation are selected \\emph{a posteriori}, in\naccordance with asymptotic behaviors that are physically relevant. The\nstability of the model against small perturbations is studied through the\nhydrodynamic perturbations of the fluid for the relevant cases. It is found\nthat a van der Waals fluid seems appropriate to describe non-eternal\ninflationary scenarios.\n", "  The CMS and ATLAS reports on a possible excess of diphoton events at $750$\nGeV are the cause of great excitement and hope. We show that a pseudoscalar\naxion coupled to the topological density of hypercharge, suggested in the past\nby Brustein and Oaknin as a candidate for inducing baryogenesis, can explain\nthe signal in the diphoton channel. The hypercharge axion (HCA) can also decay\nto $Z\\gamma$ and $ZZ$. The expected number of events in these channels is too\nsmall to have been detected, but such decays should be observed in the future.\nThe HCA can be produced via vector boson fusion (VBF) or via associated\nproduction (AP). The latter should be manifested by a characteristic decay to 3\nphotons which should be observed soon. We adapt the previous analysis of\npossible detection of the HCA at the LHC by Brustein and Oaknin and by Elfgren\nto the case that the mass of the HCA is 750 GeV and find the expected cross\nsection and decay width in terms of the HCA coupling. We find that the expected\ncross-section fits well the observed number of excess events and that there is\ntension between the measured cross-section and the reported partial decay\nwidth. The tension is caused because for both VBF and AP the production\ncross-section and the decay width depend linearly on each other. We therefore\nexpect that if the new resonance is indeed the HCA, either its width should be\nsignificantly smaller than the reported width or the production cross-section\nshould be significantly higher than the reported one.\n", "  We present a new theoretical information-geometric framework (IGAC,\nInformation Geometrodynamical Approach to Chaos) suitable to characterize\nchaotic dynamical behavior of arbitrary complex systems.\n", "  Most studies of the mean-free path accumulation function (MFPAF) rely on\noptical techniques to probe heat transfer at length scales on the order of the\nphonon mean-free path. In this paper, we propose and implement a purely\nelectrical probe of the MFPAF that relies on photo-lithographically defined\nheater-thermometer separation to set the length scale. An important advantage\nof the proposed technique is its insensitivity to the thermal interfacial\nimpedance and its compatibility with a large array of temperature-controlled\nchambers that lack optical ports. Detailed analysis of the experimental data\nbased on the enhanced Fourier law (EFL) demonstrates that heat-carrying phonons\nin gallium arsenide have a much wider mean-free path spectrum than originally\nthought.\n", "  We introduce the new version of SimProp, a Monte Carlo code for simulating\nthe propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in intergalactic space. This\nversion, SimProp v2r3, allows the choice of many more models for the\nextragalactic background light spectrum and evolution and photodisintegration\ncross sections and branching ratios than previous versions of SimProp.\n", "  In this paper we present a theoretical and numerical analysis of light\nlocalization in hollow core microstructured fibers (HCMFs) with a complicated\nshape of the core cladding boundary. The analysis is based on well established\nmodels (for example, the ARROW model) and also on the models proposed for the\nfirst time. In particular, we consider local and nonlocal mechanisms of light\nlocalization in the waveguide structures with a determined type of discrete\nrotational symmetry of the core cladding boundary. We interpret and analyze\nmechanisms of light localization in negative curvature hollow core\nmicrostructured fibers (NC HCMFs) and simplified HC PCFs with a polygonal shape\nof the core cladding boundary.\n", "  A methodology is introduced that enables an absolute, quantum-limited\nmeasurement of sub-wavelength interferometric displacements. The technique\nutilizes a high-frequency optical path modulation within an interferometer\noperated in a homodyne configuration. All of the information necessary to fully\ncharacterize the resultant path displacement is contained within the relative\nstrengths of the various harmonics of the phase modulation. The method, which\nis straightforward and readily implementable, allows a direct measurement of\nthe theoretical Cram\\'er-Rao limit of detection without any assumptions on the\nnature of the light source.\n", "  These pedagogical lecture notes address to the students in theoretical\nphysics for helping them to understand the mechanisms of the linear operators\ndefined on finite-dimensional vector spaces equipped with definite or\nindefinite inner products. The importance of the Dirac conjugation is pointed\nout presenting its general theory and a version of the Riesz theorem for the\nindefinite inner product spaces, based on the Dirac-Riesz map that combines the\naction of the Riesz map with that of the metric operator. The matrix\nrepresentations of the linear operators on vector spaces with definite or\nindefinite inner products is also presented.\n", "  We demonstrate a source of correlated photon pairs which will have\napplications in future integrated quantum photonic circuits. The source\nutilizes spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) in a dispersion-engineered\nnanowaveguide made of AlGaAs, which has merits of negligible two-photon\nabsorption and low spontaneous Raman scattering (SpRS). We observe a\ncoincidence-to-accidental (CAR) ratio up to 177, mainly limited by propagation\nlosses. Experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions of the\nSFWM photon pair generation and the SpRS noise photon generation. We also study\nthe effects from the SpRS, propagation losses, and waveguide lengths on the\nquality of our source.\n", "  A generalization of the force approach to radiation reaction is given, taken\ninto consideration an arbitrary motion of the charged particle . The expression\nobtained brings about the expression already given for the linear an the\ncircular acceleration cases.\n", "  We developed an interface program between a program suite for an automated\nsearch of chemical reaction pathways, GRRM, and a program package of\nsemiempirical methods, MOPAC. A two-step structural search is proposed as an\napplication of this interface program. A screening test is first performed by\nsemiempirical calculations. Subsequently, a reoptimization procedure is done by\nab initio or density functional calculations. We apply this approach to ion\nadsorption on cellulose. The computational efficiency is also shown for a GRRM\nsearch. The interface program is suitable for the structural search of large\nmolecular systems for which semiempirical methods are applicable.\n", "  One purpose of this proceedings-contribution is to show that at least for\nfree massless particles it is possible to construct an explicit boson theory\nwhich is exactly equivalent in terms of momenta and energy to a fermion theory.\nThe fermions come as $2^{d/2-1}$ families and the to this whole system of\nfermions corresponding bosons come as a whole series of the Kalb-Ramond fields,\none set of components for each number of indexes on the tensor fields.\n  Since Kalb-Ramond fields naturally (only) couple to the extended objects or\nbranes, we suspect that inclusion of interaction into such for a bosonization\nprepared system - except for the lowest dimensions - without including branes\nor something like that is not likely to be possible.\n  The need for the families is easily seen just by using the theorem long ago\nput forward by Aratyn and one of us (H.B.F.N.), which says that to have the\nstatistical mechanics of the fermion system and the boson system to match one\nneeds to have the number of the field components in the ratio\n$\\frac{2^{d-1}-1}{2^{d-1}}= \\frac{\\# bosons}{\\# fermions}$, enforcing that the\nnumber of fermion components must be a multiple of $2^{d-1}$, where $d$ is the\nspace-time dimension. This \"explanation\" of the number of dimension is\npotentially useful for the explanation for the number of dimension put forward\nby one of us (S.N.M.B.) since long in the spin-charge-family theory, and leads\nlike the latter to typically (a multiple of) $4$ families.\n  And this is the second purpose for our work on the fermionization in an\narbitrary number of dimensions - namely to learn how \"natural\" is the inclusion\nof the families in the way the spin-charge-family theory does.\n", "  The rapid growth in scale and complexity of both computational and\nobservational astrophysics over the past decade necessitates efficient and\nintuitive methods for examining and visualizing large datasets. Here, I present\n{\\it AstroBlend}, an open-source Python library for use within the three\ndimensional modeling software, {\\it Blender}. While {\\it Blender} has been a\npopular open-source software among animators and visual effects artists, in\nrecent years it has also become a tool for visualizing astrophysical datasets.\n{\\it AstroBlend} combines the three dimensional capabilities of {\\it Blender}\nwith the analysis tools of the widely used astrophysical toolset, {\\it yt}, to\nafford both computational and observational astrophysicists the ability to\nsimultaneously analyze their data and create informative and appealing\nvisualizations. The introduction of this package includes a description of\nfeatures, work flow, and various example visualizations. A website -\nwww.astroblend.com - has been developed which includes tutorials, and a gallery\nof example images and movies, along with links to downloadable data, three\ndimensional artistic models, and various other resources.\n", "  We study the parity-odd part (that we shall call Doppler term) of the linear\ngalaxy two-point correlation function that arises from wide-angle, velocity,\nDoppler lensing and cosmic acceleration effects. As it is important at low\nredshift and at large angular separations, the Doppler term is usually\nneglected in the current generation of galaxy surveys. For future wide-angle\ngalaxy surveys such as Euclid, SPHEREx and SKA, however, we show that the\nDoppler term must be included. The effect of these terms is dominated by the\nmagnification due to relativistic aberration effects and the slope of the\ngalaxy redshift distribution and it generally mimics the effect of the local\ntype primordial non-Gaussianity with the effective nonlinearity parameter\n$f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm eff}$ of a few, we show that this would affect forecasts on\nmeasurements of $f_{\\rm NL}$ at low-redshift. Our results show that a survey at\nlow redshift with large number density over a wide area of the sky could detect\nthe Doppler term with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim 1-20$, depending on\nsurvey specifications.\n", "  Astronomical observations have a unique ability to determine the laws of\nphysics at distant times in the universe. They, therefore, have particular\nrelevance in answering the basic question as to whether the laws of physics are\ninvariant with time. The dimesionless fundamental constants, such as the proton\nto electron mass ratio and the fine structure constant are key elements in the\ninvestigation. If they vary with time then the answer is clearly that the laws\nof physics are not invariant with time and significant new physics must be\ndeveloped to describe the universe. Limits on their variance, on the other\nhand, constrains the parameter space available to new physics that requires a\nvariation with time of basic physical law. There are now observational\nconstraints on the time variation of the proton to electron mass ratio mu at\nthe 1.E-7 level. Constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant\nalpha are less rigorous, 1E-5, but are imposed at higher redshift. The\nimplications of these limits on new cosmologies that require rolling scalar\nfields has already had its first investigations. Here we address the\nimplications on basic particle physics. The proton to electron mass ratio is\nobviously dependent on the particle physics parameters that set the mass of the\nproton and the electron. To first order the ratio is dependent on a combination\nof the Quantum Chromodynamic scale, the Yukawa couplings, and the Higgs Vacuum\nExpectation Value. Here that relationship is quantitative defined for the first\ntime. When coupled with previous determinations of the relation of the fine\nstructure constant to the same parameters two constraints exist on the\nfractional variation of these parameters with time. A third independent\nconstraint involving only the three parameters could set the stage for\nconstraints on their individual fractional variation.\n", "  We report a discovery of a 1.3 Mpc diffuse radio source with extremely steep\nspectrum fading radio structures in the vicinity of the Abell 449 cluster of\ngalaxies. Its extended diffuse lobes are bright only at low radio frequencies\nand their synchrotron age is about 160 Myr. The parent galaxy of the extended\nrelic structure, which is the dominant galaxy within the cluster, is starting a\nnew jet activity. There are three weak X-rays sources in the vicinity of the\ncluster as found in the ROSAT survey, however it is not known if they are\nconnected with this cluster of galaxies. Just a few radio galaxy relics are\ncurrently known in the literature, as finding them requires sensitive and high\nangular resolution low-frequency radio observations. Objects of this kind,\nwhich also are starting a new jet activity, are important for understanding the\nlife cycle and evolution of active galactic nuclei. A new 613 MHz map as well\nas the archival radio data pertaining to this object are presented and\nanalyzed.\n", "  The Faddeev two body bound state model is discussed as an example of a QCD\ninspired model thought by some to exhibit dimensional transmutation. This\nsimple model is solved exactly and the growth of a specified dimensional energy\nscale is shown to be an illusion.\n", "  The E and B experiment (EBEX) is a balloon-borne telescope designed to\nmeasure the polarization of the cosmic microwave background with 8' resolution\nemploying a gondola scanning with speeds of order degree per second. In January\n2013, EBEX completed 11 days of observations in a flight over Antarctica\ncovering $\\sim$ 6000 square degrees of the sky. The payload is equipped with\ntwo redundant star cameras and two sets of three orthogonal gyroscopes to\nreconstruct the telescope attitude. The EBEX science goals require the pointing\nto be reconstructed to approximately 10\" in the map domain, and in-flight\nattitude control requires the real time pointing to be accurate to $\\sim$\n0.5$^{\\circ}$ . The high velocity scan strategy of EBEX coupled to its float\naltitude only permits the star cameras to take images at scan turnarounds,\nevery $\\sim$ 40 seconds, and thus requires the development of a pointing system\nwith low noise gyroscopes and carefully controlled systematic errors. Here we\nreport on the design of the pointing system and on a simulation pipeline\ndeveloped to understand and minimize the effects of systematic errors. The\nperformance of the system is evaluated using the 2012/2013 flight data, and we\nshow that we achieve a pointing error with RMS=25\" on 40 seconds azimuth\nthrows, corresponding to an error of $\\sim$ 4.6\" in the map domain.\n", "  It is observed that the exact interacting ground-state electronic energy of\ninterest may be obtained directly, in principle, as a simple sum of orbital\nenergies when a universal density-dependent term is added to $w\\left(\\left[\n\\rho \\right];\\mathbf{r} \\right)$, the familiar Hartree plus\nexchange-correlation component in the Kohn-Sham effective potential. The\nresultant shifted potential, $\\bar{w}\\left(\\left[ \\rho \\right];\\mathbf{r}\n\\right)$, actually changes less on average than $w\\left(\\left[ \\rho\n\\right];\\mathbf{r} \\right)$ when the density changes, including the fact that\n$\\bar{w}\\left(\\left[ \\rho \\right];\\mathbf{r} \\right)$ does not undergo a\ndiscontinuity when the number of electrons increases through an integer. Thus\nthe approximation of $\\bar{w}\\left(\\left[ \\rho \\right];\\mathbf{r} \\right)$\nrepresents an alternative direct approach for the approximation of the\nground-state energy and density.\n", "  Performance analysis of $l_0$ norm constrained Recursive least Squares (RLS)\nalgorithm is attempted in this paper. Though the performance pretty attractive\ncompared to its various alternatives, no thorough study of theoretical analysis\nhas been performed. Like the popular $l_0$ Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm,\nin $l_0$ RLS, a $l_0$ norm penalty is added to provide zero tap attractions on\nthe instantaneous filter taps. A thorough theoretical performance analysis has\nbeen conducted in this paper with white Gaussian input data under assumptions\nsuitable for many practical scenarios. An expression for steady state MSD is\nderived and analyzed for variations of different sets of predefined variables.\nAlso a Taylor series expansion based approximate linear evolution of the\ninstantaneous MSD has been performed. Finally numerical simulations are carried\nout to corroborate the theoretical analysis and are shown to match well for a\nwide range of parameters.\n", "  Using a recently proposed classification for the primary translationally\nshape invariant potentials, we show that the exact quantization rule formulated\nby Ma and Xu is equivalent to the supersymmetric JWKB quantization condition.\nThe energy levels for the two considered categories of shaped invariant\npotentials are also derived.\n", "  We are concerned with the asymptotic analysis of positive blow-up boundary\nsolutions for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations with absorption term.\nBy means of the Karamata theory we establish the first two terms in the\nexpansion of the singular solution near the boundary. Our analysis includes\nlarge classes of nonlinearities of Keller-Osserman type.\n", "  Oxygen vacancy is intrinsically coupled with magnetic, electronic and\ntransport properties of transition-metal oxide materials and directly\ndetermines their multifunctionality. Here, we demonstrate reversible control of\noxygen content by post-annealing at temperature lower than 300 degree\ncentigrade and realize the reversible metal-insulator transition in epitaxial\nNdNiO3 films. Importantly, over six orders of magnitude in the resistance\nmodulation and a large change in optical band gap are demonstrated at room\ntemperature without destroying the parent framework and changing the p-type\nconductive mechanism. Further study revealed that oxygen vacancies stabilized\nthe insulating phase at room temperature is universal for perovskite nickelates\nfilms. Acting as electron donors, oxygen vacancies not only stabilize the\ninsulating phase at room temperature, but also induce a large magnetization of\n~50 emu/cm3 due to the formation of strongly correlated Ni2+ t2g6eg2 states.\nThe band gap opening is an order of magnitude larger than that of the thermally\ndriven metal-insulator transition and continuously tunable. Potential\napplication of the newly found insulating phase in photovoltaics has been\ndemonstrated in the nickelates-based heterojunctions. Our discovery opens up\nnew possibilities for strongly correlated perovskite nickelates.\n", "  We introduce \"Replicated Entanglement Entropy (REE)\" as the entanglement\nentropy of a subspace in a replicated theory. We calculate this quantity by\nreplicating the original theory in two steps along the same entangling region\nand taking the proper limit on the second replica number. The quantity has a\nclear physical meaning, a thermodynamic interpretation and a holographic dual.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the use of a novel liquid state,\nwhispering-gallery-mode optical resonator as a highly sensitive humidity\nsensor. The optical resonator used consists of a droplet made of glycerol, a\ntransparent liquid that enables high optical quality factor, doped with\nrhodamine 6G, which acts as fluorescent emitter. As glycerol is highly\nhygroscopic, the refractive index and radius of the droplet change with ambient\nhumidity. This produces a shift on the whispering gallery modes wavelengths,\nwhich modulates the emission of rhodamine 6G. This easily-made device has an\nunpreceded sensitivity of 10-3 per relative humidity percent.\n", "  Activation cross sections for proton induced reactions on Sm are presented\nfor the first time for\n$^{nat}$Sm(p,xn)$^{154,152m2,152m1,152g,150m,150g,149,148,147,146,145}$Eu,\n$^{nat}$Sm(p,x)$^{153,145}$Sm,\n$^{nat}$Sm(p,x)$^{151,150,149,148g,148m,146,144,143}$Pm and\n$^{nat}$Sm(p,x)$^{141}$Nd up to 65 MeV. The cross sections were measured via\nactivation method by using a stacked-foil irradiation technique and high\nresolution gamma ray spectroscopy. The results were compared with results of\nthe nuclear reaction codes ALICE, EMPIRE and TALYS (results taken from TENDL\nlibraries). Integral yields of the activation products were calculated from the\nexcitation functions.\n", "  Leaves are the organs that intercept light and create photosynthesis.\nEfficient light interception is provided by leaves oriented orthogonal to most\nof the sun rays. Except in the polar regions, this means orthogonal to the\ndirection of acceleration due to gravity, or simply horizontal. The leaves of\nalmost all terrestrial plants grow in a gravity field that tends to bend them\ndownward and therefore may counteract light interception. Plants thus allocate\nbiomass for self-support in order to maintain their leaves horizontal. To\ncompete with other species (inter-species competition), as well as other\nindividuals within the same species (intra-species competition), self-support\nmust be achieved with the least biomass produced. This study examines to what\nextent leaves are designed to self-support. We show here that a basic\nmechanical model provides the optimal dimensions of a leaf for light\ninterception and self-support. These results are compared to measurements made\non leaves of various giant monocot species,especially palm trees and banana\ntrees. The comparison between experiments and model predictions shows that the\nlonger palms are optimally designed for self-support whereas shorter leaves are\nshaped predominantly by other parameters of selection.\n", "  This article reports on tunable electron backscattering investigated with the\nbiased tip of a scanning force microscope. Using a channel defined by a pair of\nSchottky gates, the branched electron flow of ballistic electrons injected from\na quantum point contact is guided by potentials of a tunable height well below\nthe Fermi energy. The transition from injection into an open two-dimensional\nelectron gas to a strongly confined channel exhibits three experimentally\ndistinct regimes: one in which branches spread unrestrictedly, one in which\nbranches are confined but the background conductance is affected very little,\nand one where the branches have disappeared and the conductance is strongly\nmodified. Classical trajectory-based simulations explain these regimes at the\nmicroscopic level. These experiments allow us to understand under which\nconditions branches observed in scanning gate experiments do or do not reflect\nthe flow of electrons.\n", "  A method to find optimal 2nd-order perturbations is presented, and applied to\nfind the optimal spanwise-wavy surface for suppression of cylinder wake\ninstability. Second-order perturbations are required to capture the stabilizing\neffect of spanwise waviness, which is ignored by standard adjoint-based\nsensitivity analyses. Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order\nsensitivity is formulated for base flow changes satisfying linearised\nNavier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global\ninstability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity\nto shape modifications. Using this formulation, we find the optimal shape to\nsuppress the a cylinder wake instability. The optimal shape is then perturbed\nby random distributions in full 3D stability analysis to confirm that it is a\nlocal optimal at the given amplitude and wavelength. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat none of the 10 random wavy shapes alone stabilize the wake flow at Re=50,\nwhile the optimal shape does. At Re=100, surface waviness of maximum height 1%\nof the cylinder diameter is sufficient to stabilize the flow. The optimal\nsurface creates streaks by passively extracting energy from the base flow\nderivatives and effectively altering the tangential velocity component at the\nwall, as opposed to spanwise-wavy suction which inputs energy to the normal\nvelocity component at the wall. This paper presents a fully two-dimensional and\ncomputationally affordable method to find optimal 2nd-order perturbations of\ngeneric flow instability problems and any boundary control (such as boundary\nforcing, shape modulation or suction).\n", "  The Raman spectrum of Ba2CuGe2O7, a tetragonal insulator which develops\nDzyaloshinsky- Moriya helical magnetism below TN = 3.2 K, has been detected at\ntemperatures varying from 300 to 80 K in a single crystal, with the radiation\npolarized either in the ab plane or along the c axis of its tetragonal cell. 29\nphonon lines out of the 35 allowed by the Raman selection rules for the present\ngeometry were observed, and their vibrational frequencies were found in overall\ngood agreement with those provided by shell-model calculations. Together with\nthe previous report on the infrared-active phonons [A. Nucara et al., Phys.\nRev. B 90, 014304 (2014)] the present study provides an exhaustive description,\nboth experimental and theoretical, of the lattice dynamics in Ba2CuGe2O7.\n", "  To derive bounds on the strain and stress response of a two-component\ncomposite material with viscoelastic phases, we revisit the so-called analytic\nmethod (Bergman 1978), which allows one to approximate the complex effective\ntensor, function of the ratio of the component shear moduli, as the sum of\npoles weighted by positive semidefinite residue matrices. The novelty of this\ninvestigation lies in the application of such a method, previously applied\n(Milton 1980; Bergman 1980) to problems involving cyclic loadings in the\nfrequency domain, to derive bounds in the time domain for the antiplane\nviscoelasticity case. The position of the poles and the residues matrices are\nthe variational parameters of the problem: the aim is to determine such\nparameters in order to have the minimum (or maximum) response at any given\nmoment in time. All the information about the composite is translated for each\nfixed pole configuration into constraints on the residues, the so-called sum\nrules. The linearity of the constraints, along with the observation that the\nresponse at a fixed time is linear in the residues, enables one to use the\ntheory of linear programming to reduce the problem to one involving relatively\nfew non-zero residues. Finally, bounds on the response are obtained by\nnumerically optimizing over the pole positions. In the examples studied, the\nresults turn out to be very accurate estimates: if sufficient information about\nthe composite is available, the bounds can be quite tight over the entire range\nof time, allowing one to predict the transient behavior of the composite.\nFurthermore, the bounds incorporating the volume fractions (and possibly\ntransverse isotropy) can be extremely tight at certain specific times.\n", "  Biological systems exhibit large-scale self-organized dynamics and structures\nwhich enable organisms to perform the functions of life. The field of active\nmatter strives to develop and understand microscopically-driven nonequilibrium\nmaterials, with emergent properties comparable to those of living systems. This\nreview will describe two recently developed classes of active matter systems,\nin which simple building blocks --- self-propelled colloidal particles or\nextensile rod-like particles --- self-organize to form macroscopic structures\nwith features not possible in equilibrium systems. We summarize the recent\nexperimental and theoretical progress on each of these systems, and we present\nsimple descriptions of the physics underlying their emergent behaviors.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional deformation field induced by an axial (In,Ga)N\nsegment in a GaN nanowire. Using the finite element method within the framework\nof linear elasticity theory, we study the dependence of the strain field on the\nratio of segment length and nanowire radius. Contrary to intuition, the\nout-of-plane-component of the elastic strain tensor is found to assume large\nnegative values for a length-to-radius ratio close to one. We show that this\nunexpected effect is a direct consequence of the deformation of the nanowire at\nthe free sidewalls and the associated large shear strain components. Simulated\nreciprocal space maps of a single (In,Ga)N/GaN nanowire demonstrate that\nnanofocus x-ray diffraction is a suitable technique to assess this peculiar\nstrain state experimentally.\n", "  We present a general framework that allows to compute the resummed\ntransverse-momentum distribution of a system of colorless particles. The\nimplementation is fully differential in the degrees of freedom of the\nfinal-state system. As a first application, we consider the transverse-momentum\nspectrum of ZZ and WW boson pairs produced in hadron collisions, where we resum\nthe logarithmically enhanced contributions due to multiple soft-gluon emission\nat small transverse momenta to all orders in perturbation theory. We exploit\nthe most advanced perturbative information for the ZZ and WW production\nprocesses that is available at present by combining next-to-next-to-leading\norder QCD corrections with next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation.\n", "  As the interest in adhesion is shifting towards smaller and smaller scales,\nthe well known Tabor adhesion parameter decreases and the DMT theory is\nfrequently considered to be the appropriate limit. A very attractive much\nsimplified version of DMT has been proposed in a recent investigation of rough\ncontacts by Pastewka & Robbins (PNAS, 111(9), 3298-3303, 2014) which seems to\nwork in very general conditions in numerical experiments. However, when\ncomparing this calculation to the known theories for the sphere, surprisingly\nlarge conflicts occur, and the reason for the success of the numerical\nexperiments is obscure.\n", "  Understanding how person-to-person contagious processes spread through a\npopulation requires accurate information on connections between population\nmembers. However, such connectivity data, when collected via interview, is\noften incomplete due to partial recall, respondent fatigue or study design,\ne.g., fixed choice designs (FCD) truncate out-degree by limiting the number of\ncontacts each respondent can report. Past research has shown how FCD truncation\naffects network properties, but its implications for predicted speed and size\nof spreading processes remain largely unexplored. To study the impact of degree\ntruncation on spreading processes, we generated collections of synthetic\nnetworks containing specific properties (degree distribution,\ndegree-assortativity, clustering), and also used empirical social network data\nfrom 75 villages in Karnataka, India. We simulated FCD using various truncation\nthresholds and ran a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) process on each\nnetwork. We found that spreading processes propagated on truncated networks\nresulted in slower and smaller epidemics, with a sudden decrease in prediction\naccuracy at a level of truncation that varied by network type. Our results have\nimplications beyond FCD to truncation due to any limited sampling from a larger\nnetwork. We conclude that knowledge of network structure is important for\nunderstanding the accuracy of predictions of process spread on degree truncated\nnetworks.\n", "  The first half of the review dedicated to survey works on Be stars (Baade,\nMartayan, and Rivinius, this vol.) put emphasis on what we can learn from\nsurveys about Be stars as a part of an environment, such as Be stars in\nbinaries, Be stars in different metalicities, or Be stars as part of a star\nforming and then co-evolving group. This second half will rather concentrate on\nthe information that more focused surveys can give on a Be star, understood as\nan individual object, and in this way attempts to bridge the gap between highly\ndetailed single star studies, and necessarily broad survey and catalog work.\n", "  Spectroscopic observations of Achernar over the past decades, have shown the\nphotospheric line width, as measured by the rotational parameter $v \\sin i$, to\nvary in correlation with the emission activity. Here we present new\nobservations, covering the most recent activity phase, and further archival\ndata collected from the archives. The $v \\sin i$ variation is confirmed. On the\nbasis of the available data it cannot be decided with certainty whether the\nincreased line width precedes the emission activity, i.e. is a signature of the\nejection mechanism, or postdates is, which would make it a signature of\nre-accretion of some of the disk-material. However, the observed evidence leans\ntowards the re-accretion hypothesis. Two further stars showing the effect of\nvariable line width in correlation with emission activity, namely 66 Oph and\n$\\pi$ Aqr, are presented as well.\n", "  We report on the OHANA interferometric snapshot survey, carried out by the\nVLTI group at the Paranal observatory. It makes use of observing time not\nuseful for any other scheduled scientific or technical tasks in the sense of a\nbackup programme, to characterize the mass-loss for early-type stars. The\nsurvey employs the combination of AMBER's high spectral and spatial resolution.\nThe spatially unresolved central object provides a reference frame for the\nfringe properties observed in the light of the continuum.\n", "  Recent researches on the solution of Schwinger-Dyson equations, as well as\nlattice simulations of pure QCD, suggest that the gluon propagator is massive.\nIn this letter, we assume that the classical counterpart of this massive gluon\nfield may be represented with the equation of motion for Yang-Mills theory with\na mass term added. A new classical solution is given for this equation. It is\ndiscussed that this solution may have some role in confinement.\n", "  Anyons have recently received great attention due to their promising\napplication in topological quantum computation. The best validated system that\nenjoys the anyonic excitations are the Laughlin states. The quasi-particles in\nLaughlin states are neither fermions nor bosons but possess the discrete\nstatistical angle ? = ?=m, with m being an integer. Here we report a possible\nrealization of the universal Abelian anyons, whose statistical angle can be\ntuned continuously by external parameters and can take any arbitrary values\ninterpolating ? = 0 and ? = ?. The proposed setup is the surface state of a\nthree dimensional topological insulator driven by an amplitude-modulated\ncircularly-polarized light. It is found that the external field leads to a\nparticular Floquet phase, which is a two-spatial-dimensional analogy of the\nWeyl semimetal phase in the Floquet first Brillouin zone. The chiral anomaly of\nthis phase results in a U(1) Chern-Simons gauge theory with a tunable Floquet\nChern number. Owing to this underlying gauge field theory, the irradiated\nsurface of topological insulator constitutes a promising platform for the\nobservation of the universal anyons.\n", "  Context. The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three\npillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions (\" cold chemistry \"), endothermic\nneutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers (\" warm\nchemistry \"), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm\nchemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation\nregions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of\ncold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the\nassociation of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to\nunderstand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the\navailable reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the\nground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT\non-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along\nwith ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the\nhyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity\ncomponents on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate\nnumber of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with\ndownhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for\nH2, and HI $\\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\\_H2 = N(H\n2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as\na function of f^N\\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a\nhigh significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen,\nwith an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \\times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.\nWhile the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely\ncorrelated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer\ninspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density\ncontrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can\ncoexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less\nfrequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct\nconsequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when\nnot enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a\ncomparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\\_H2, showing a clear correlation.\nThe hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed\nas the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the\nbranching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is\nconfined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory\nmeasurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column\ndensities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm\nprobability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar\nMHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant\nbecause there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is\ndifficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the\nobserved abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold\nion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.\n", "  The application of photography to astronomy was a critical step in the\ndevelopment of astrophysics at the end of the nineteenth century. Using\ncustom-built photographic telescopes and objective prisms, astronomers took\nimages of the sky on glass plates during a 100-year period from many observing\nstations around the globe. After each plate was developed, astronomers and\ntheir assistants studied and annotated the plates as they made astrometric,\nphotometric and spectroscopic measurements, counted galaxies, observed stellar\nvariability, tracked meteors, and calculated the ephemerides of asteroids and\ncomets. In this paper, the authors assess the importance of the plate\nannotations for future scientific, historical, and educational programs.\nUnfortunately, many of these interesting annotations are now being erased when\ngrime is removed from the plates before they are digitized to make the\nphotometric data available for time-domain astrophysics. To see what\nprofessional astronomers and historians think about this situation, the authors\nconducted a survey. This paper captures the lively discussion on the pros and\ncons of the removal of plate markings, how to best to document them if they\nmust be cleaned off, and what to do with plates whose annotations are deemed\ntoo valuable to be erased. Three appendices to the paper offer professional\nguidance on the best practices for handling and cleaning the plates,\nphotographing any annotations, and rehousing them.\n", "  We construct an induced gravity (pregeometry) where both the Newton constant\nand the cosmological constant appear as integration constants in solving field\nequations. By adding the kinetic terms of ghosts and antighosts, an action of\nthe induced gravity is transformed to a topological field theory. Moreover, by\nsolving field equations of the topological field theory in the FRW universe, we\nfind an inflation solution. The present study might shed some light on a close\nrelationship between the induced gravity and the topological quantum field\ntheory.\n", "  The self-excitation of plasma series resonance (PSR) oscillations is a\nprominent feature in the current of low pressure capacitive radio frequency\n(RF) discharges. This resonance leads to high frequency oscillations of the\ncharge in the sheaths and enhances electron heating. Up to now, the phenomenon\nhas only been observed in asymmetric discharges. There, the nonlinearity in the\nvoltage balance, which is necessary for the self-excitation of resonance\noscillations with frequencies above the applied frequencies, is caused\npredominantly by the quadratic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of\nthe plasma sheaths. Using PIC/MCC simulations of single- and multi- frequency\ncapacitive discharges and an equivalent circuit model, we demonstrate that\nother mechanisms such as a cubic contribution to the charge-voltage relation of\nthe plasma sheaths and the time dependent bulk electron plasma frequency can\ncause the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, as well. These mechanisms have\nbeen neglected in previous models, but are important for the theoretical\ndescription of the current in symmetric or weakly asymmetric discharges.\n", "  A new quantum ontology of quantum mechanics has been proposed recently. This\nontology is based on impossible to realize measurements which need to be\nperformed repeatedly on the same single physical system or on the same pair of\nphysical systems. We agree that quantum mechanics is a contextual theory and\nthat the experimental contexts have to be a part of any description of quantum\nphenomena but in our opinion this new ontology is neither convincing nor\nuseful. In particular the authors claim that their ontology explains the\npeaceful coexistence between quantum mechanics and relativity in spin\npolarization correlation experiments. We show that, contrary to their claim,\nthe authors are unable to explain why strong correlations, between the outcomes\nof distant local measurements, do exist and why they preserve a condition of\nparameter independence (non-signaling). Strangely enough the authors ignore\nthat these strong but imperfect correlations can be explained in a local and\ncausal way using statistical contextual interpretation of quantum mechanics\nwhat was demonstrated in several articles.\n", "  In this paper, by representing a single level rate equation model for\nInAs/GaAs quantum dot lasers and computations by fourth order Runge-Kutta\nmethod some characteristics of the output laser are considered. The change of\nphoton number in time and current and also the output power versus current with\ndifferent gain compression factors are investigated for lasing from ground\nstate (GS). Afterwards, the response function of small signal modulation for\nground state in constant current but different gain compressions is surveyed.\nAt last, we find an optimum value for gain compression factor in lasing from\nGS.\n", "  Investigation of simple far-from-equilibrium systems exhibiting phase\nseparation leads to the conclusion that phase coexistence is not well defined\nin this context. This is because the properties of the coexisting\nnonequilibrium systems depend on how they are placed in contact, as verified in\nthe driven lattice gas with attractive interactions, and in the two-temperature\nlattice gas, under (a) weak global exchange between uniform systems, and (b)\nphase-separated (nonuniform) systems. Thus, far from equilibrium, the notions\nof universality of phase coexistence (i.e., independence of how systems\nexchange particles and/or energy), and of phases with intrinsic properties\n(independent of their environment) are lost.\n", "  This review covers the measurements related to the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL) intensity from gamma-rays to radio in the electromagnetic spectrum\nover 20 decades in the wavelength. The cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nremains the best measured spectrum with an accuracy better than 1%. The\nmeasurements related to the cosmic optical background (COB), centered at 1\nmicrons, are impacted by the large zodiacal light associated with\ninterplanetary dust in the inner Solar system. The best measurements of COB\ncome from an indirect technique involving Gamma-ray spectra of bright blazars\nwith an absorption feature resulting from pair-production off of COB photons.\nThe cosmic infrared background (CIB) peaking at around 100 microns established\nan energetically important background with an intensity comparable to the\noptical background. This discovery paved the path for large aperture\nfar-infrared and sub-millimeter observations resulting in the discovery of\ndusty, starbursting galaxies. Their role in galaxy formation and evolution\nremains an active area of research in modern-day astrophysics. The extreme UV\nbackground remains mostly unexplored and will be a challenge to measure due to\nthe high Galactic background and absorption of extragalactic photons by the\nintergalactic medium at these EUV/soft X-ray energies. We also summarize our\nunderstanding of the spatial anisotropies and angular power spectra of\nintensity fluctuations. We motivate a precise direct measurement of the COB\nbetween 0.1 to 5 microns using a small aperture telescope observing either from\nthe outer Solar system, at distances of 5 AU or more, or out of the ecliptic\nplane. Other future applications include improving our understanding of the\nbackground at TeV energies and spectral distortions of CMB and CIB.\n", "  The $\\nu_e$ appearance data of T2K experiment has given a glimpse of the\nallowed parameters in the hierarchy-$\\delta_{CP}$ parameter space. In this\npaper, we explore how this data affects our expectations regarding the\nhierarchy sensitivity of the NO$\\nu$A experiment. For the favourable\ncombinations of hierarchy and $\\delta_{CP}$, the hierarchy sensitivity of\nNO$\\nu$A is unaffected by the addition of T2K data. For the unfavourable\ncombinations, NO$\\nu$A data gives degenerate solutions. Among these degenerate\nsolutions, T2K data prefers IH and $\\delta_{CP}$ in the lower half plane over\nNH and $\\delta_{CP}$ in the upper half plane. Hence, addition of the T2K data\nto NO$\\nu$A creates a bias towards IH and $\\delta_{CP}$ in the lower half plane\nirrespective of what the true combination is.\n", "  This is a study of a class of nonlocal nonlinear diffusion equations. We\npresent a strong maximum principle for nonlocal time-dependent Dirichlet\nproblems. Results are for bounded functions of space, rather than\n(semi)-continuous functions. Solutions that attain interior global extrema must\nbe identically trivial. However, depending on the nonlinearity, trivial\nsolutions may not be constant in space; they may have an infinite number of\ndiscontinuities, for example. We give examples of nonconstant trivial solutions\nfor different nonlinearities. For porous medium-type equations, these functions\ndo not solve the associated classical differential equations, even those in\nweak form. We also show that these problems are globally wellposed for\nLipschitz, nonnegative diffusion coefficients.\n", "  We consider N = 2 superconformal field theory with following properties: a)\nCoulomb branch operators have fractional scaling dimensions, b) there are exact\nmarginal deformations . The weakly coupled gauge theory descriptions are found\nby decomposing 3d mirror into different components, and different\ndecompositions correspond to different duality frames. The gauge theory is\nformed by gauging Argyres-Douglas matter, and we write down all duality frames\nfor several classes with infinite sequence of theories.\n", "  In this work a classical derivation of fractional order circuits models is\npresented. Generalized constitutive equations in terms of fractional\nRiemann-Liouville derivatives are introduced in the Maxwell's equations. Next\nthe Kirchhoff voltage law is applied in a RCL circuit configuration. A\nfractional differential equation model is obtained with Caputo derivatives.\nThus standard initial conditions apply.\n", "  Type-II Weyl fermion nodes, located at the touching points between electron\nand hole pockets, have been recently predicted to occur in distorted octahedral\n($T'$) transition metal dichalcogenide semimetals, contingent upon the\ncondition that the layered crystal has the noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic\n($T'_{or}$) stacking. Here, we report on the emergence of two shear Raman bands\nactivated by inversion symmetry breaking in $T'$-MoTe$_2$ due to sample\ncooling. Polarization and crystal orientation resolved measurements further\npoint to a phase transition from the monoclinic ($T'_{mo}$) structure to the\ndesired $T'_{or}$ lattice. These results provide spectroscopic evidence that\nlow-temperature $T'$-MoTe$_2$ is suitable for probing type-II Weyl physics.\n", "  We report a high performance nodeless hollow-core anti-resonant fiber with a\nbroadband guidance from 1050 nm to >1900 nm, a transmission attenuation of 200\ndB/km, and a low bending loss of 0.25 dB/m for a 5 cm radius at wavelength of\n1550 nm.\n", "  We present the results of a laboratory experimental study of an internal wave\nfield generated by harmonic, spatially-periodic boundary forcing from above of\na density stratification comprising a strongly-stratified, thin upper layer\nsitting atop a weakly-stratified, deep lower layer. In linear regimes, the\nenergy flux associated with relatively high frequency internal waves excited in\nthe upper layer is prevented from entering the lower layer by virtue of\nevanescent decay of the wave field. In the experiments, however, we find that\nthe development of parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) in the upper layer\ntransfers energy from the forced primary wave into a pair of subharmonic\ndaughter waves, each capable of penetrating the weakly-stratified lower layer.\nWe find that around $10\\%$ of the primary wave energy flux penetrates into the\nlower layer via this nonlinear wave-wave interaction for the regime we study.\n", "  Given a planar domain $\\Omega$, the Bergman analytic content measures the\n$L^{2}(\\Omega)$-distance between $\\bar{z}$ and the Bergman space\n$A^{2}(\\Omega)$. We compute the Bergman analytic content of simply-connected\nquadrature domains with quadrature formula supported at one point, and we also\ndetermine the function $f \\in A^2(\\Omega)$ that best approximates $\\bar{z}$. We\nshow that, for simply-connected domains, the square of Bergman analytic content\nis equivalent to torsional rigidity from classical elasticity theory, while for\nmultiply-connected domains these two domain constants are not equivalent in\ngeneral.\n", "  Recent synthesis of monolayer borophene (triangle boron monolayer) on the\nsubstrate opens the era of boron nanosheet (Science, 350, 1513,\n$\\mathbf{2015}$), but the structural stability and novel physical properties\nare still open issues. Here we demonstrated borophene can be stabilized with\nfully surface hydrogenation, called as borophane, from first-principles\ncalculations. Most interesting, it shows that borophane has direction-dependent\nDirac cones, which are mainly contributed by in-plane \\emph{p$_{x}$} and\n\\emph{p$_{y}$} orbitals of boron atoms. The Dirac fermions possess an ultrahigh\nFermi velocity up to 3.0$\\times$10$^{6}$ m/s, 4 times higher than that of\ngraphene. The Young's modules are calculated to be 129 and 200 GPa$\\cdot$nm\nalong two different directions, which is comparable with steel. The ultrahigh\nFermi velocity and high mechanical feature render borophane ideal for\nnanoelectronics applications.\n", "  We enumerate all local minima of the energy landscape for model rigid\nadsorbates characterized by three or four equivalent binding sites (e.g., thiol\ngroups) on a close-packed (111) surface of a face-centered-cubic crystal. We\nshow that the number of energy minima increases linearly with molecular size\nwith a rate of increase that depends on the degree of registry between the\nmolecule shape and the surface structure. The sparseness of energy minima and\nthe large variations in the center-of-mass positions of these minima vs\nmolecular size for molecules that are incommensurate with the surface suggests\na strong coupling in these molecules between surface mobility and shape or size\nfluctuations resulting from molecular vibrations. We also find that the\nvariation in the binding energy with respect to molecular size decreases more\nrapidly with molecular size for molecules with a higher degree of registry with\nthe surface. This indicates that surface adsorption should be better able to\ndistinguish molecules by size if the molecules are incommensurate with the\nsurface.\n", "  Biaxial strain dependence of electronic structures and thermoelectric\nproperties of monolayer $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$, including compressive and tensile\nstrain, are investigated by using local-density approximation (LDA) plus\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC). Both LDA and LDA+SOC results show that\n$\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ is a direct gap semiconductor with optimized lattice\nconstants. It is found that SOC has important effect on power factor, which can\nenhance one in n-type doping, but has a obvious detrimental influence for\np-type. Both compressive and tensile strain can induce direct-indirect gap\ntransition, which produce remarkable influence on power factor. Calculated\nresults show that strain can induce significantly enhanced power factor in\nn-type doping by compressive strain and in p-type doping by tensile strain at\nthe critical strain of direct-indirect gap transition. These can be explained\nby strain-induced accidental degeneracies, which leads to improved Seebeck\ncoefficient. Calculated results show that n-type doping can provide better\npower factor than p-type doping. These results make us believe that\nthermoelectric properties of monolayer $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$ can be improved in\nn-type doping by compressive strain.\n", "  Foursquare is an online social network and can be represented with a\nbipartite network of users and venues. A user-venue pair is connected if a user\nhas checked-in at that venue. In the case of Foursquare, network analysis\ntechniques can be used to enhance the user experience. One such technique is\nlink prediction, which can be used to build a personalized recommendation\nsystem of venues. Recommendation systems in bipartite networks are very often\ndesigned using the global ranking method and collaborative filtering. A less\nknown method- network based inference is also a feasible choice for link\nprediction in bipartite networks and sometimes performs better than the\nprevious two. In this paper we test these techniques on the Foursquare network.\nThe best technique proves to be the network based inference. We also show that\ntaking into account the available metadata can be beneficial.\n", "  We study the nucleation of blebs, i.e., protrusions arising from a local\ndetachment of the membrane from the cortex of a cell. Based on a simple model\nof elastic linkers with force-dependent kinetics, we show that bleb nucleation\nis governed by membrane peeling. By this mechanism, the growth or shrinkage of\na detached membrane patch is completely determined by the linker kinetics,\nregardless of the energetic cost of the detachment. We predict the critical\nnucleation radius for membrane peeling and the corresponding effective energy\nbarrier. These may be typically smaller than those predicted by classical\nnucleation theory, implying a much faster nucleation. We also perform\nsimulations of a continuum stochastic model of membrane-cortex adhesion to\nobtain the statistics of bleb nucleation times as a function of the stress on\nthe membrane. The determinant role of membrane peeling changes our\nunderstanding of bleb nucleation and opens new directions in the study of\nblebs.\n", "  In this article we study restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature\nfor quark matter with a chiral chemical potential, $\\mu_5$, by means of a\nquark-meson model with vacuum fluctuations included. Vacuum fluctuations give a\ndivergent contribution to the vacuum energy, so the latter has to be\nrenormalized before computing physical quantities. The vacuum term is important\nfor restoration of chiral symmetry at finite temperature and $\\mu_5\\neq0$,\ntherefore we present several plausible renormalization schemes for the\nultraviolet divergences at $\\mu_5\\neq0$. Then we compute the critical\ntemperature as a function of $\\mu_5$. The main result of our study is that the\nchoice of a renormalization scheme affects the critical temperature; among the\nthree renormalization schemes we investigate, there exists one in which the\ncritical temperature increases with $\\mu_5$, a result which has not been found\nbefore by chiral model studies and which is in qualitative agreement with\nrecent lattice data as well as with studies based on Schwinger-Dyson equations\nand universality arguments.\n", "  BiMnO3 (BMO), ferromagnetic (FM) below Tc = 100 K, was believed to be also\nferroelectric (FE) due to a non-centro-symmetric C2 structure, until\ndiffraction data indicated that its space group is the centro-symmetric C2/c.\nHere we present infrared phonon spectra of BMO, taken on a mosaic of single\ncrystals, which are consistent with C2/c at any T > 10 K, as well as\nroom-temperature Raman data which strongly support this conclusion. We also\nfind that the infrared intensity of several phonons increases steadily for\ndecreasing T, causing the relative permittivity of BMO to vary from 18.5 at 300\nK to 45 at 10 K. At variance with FE materials of displacive type, no\nappreciable softening has been found in the infrared phonons. Both their\nfrequencies and intensities, moreover, appear insensitive to the FM transition\nat Tc.\n", "  The complex organization of syntax in hierarchical structures is one of the\ncore design features of human language. Duality of patterning refers for\ninstance to the organization of the meaningful elements in a language at two\ndistinct levels: a combinatorial level where meaningless forms are combined\ninto meaningful forms and a compositional level where meaningful forms are\ncomposed into larger lexical units. The question remains wide open regarding\nhow such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical\nframework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper\nis that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we\nintroduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and\ncompositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these\nobservables in human natural languages. Second, we show that the theoretical\npredictions of a multi-agents modeling scheme, namely the Blending Game, are in\nsurprisingly good agreement with empirical data. In the Blending Game a\npopulation of individuals plays language games aiming at success in\ncommunication. It is remarkable that the two sides of duality of patterning\nemerge simultaneously as a consequence of a pure cultural dynamics in a\nsimulated environment that contains meaningful relations, provided a simple\nconstraint on message transmission fidelity is also considered.\n", "  Stars are massive resonators that may be used as gravitational-wave (GW)\ndetectors with isotropic sensitivity. New insights on stellar physics are being\nmade possible by asteroseismology, the study of stars by the observation of\ntheir natural oscillations. The continuous monitoring of oscillation modes in\nstars of different masses and sizes (e.g., as carried out by NASA's Kepler\nmission) opens the possibility of surveying the local Universe for GW\nradiation. Red-giant stars are of particular interest in this regard. Since the\nmean separation between red giants in open clusters is small (a few light\nyears), this can in principle be used to look for the same GW imprint on the\noscillation modes of different stars as a GW propagates across the cluster.\nFurthermore, the frequency range probed by oscillations in red giants\ncomplements the capabilities of the planned eLISA space interferometer. We\npropose asteroseismology of red giants as a novel approach in the search for\ngravitational waves.\n", "  We first briefly review the Coset Space Dimensional Reduction (CSDR)\nprogramme and present the results of the best model so far, based on the\n$\\mathcal{N} = 1$, $d = 10$, $E_8$ gauge theory reduced over the\nnearly-K\\\"ahler manifold $SU(3)/U(1)\\times U(1)$. Then, we present the\nadjustment of the CSDR programme in the case that the extra dimensions are\nconsidered to be fuzzy coset spaces and then, the best model constructed in\nthis framework, too, which is the trinification GUT, $SU(3)^3$.\n", "  The magnetic properties of a nanoscale system are inextricably linked to its\nlocal environment. In ad-atoms on surfaces and inorganic layered structures the\nexchange interactions result from the relative lattice positions, layer\nthicknesses and other environmental parameters. Here, we report on a\nsample-dependent sign inversion of the magnetic exchange coupling between the\nthree unpaired spins of an organic triradical molecule embedded in a\nthree-terminal device. This ferro-to-antiferromagnetic transition is due to\nstructural distortions and results in a high-to-low spin ground state change in\na molecule traditionally considered to be a robust high-spin quartet. Moreover,\nthe flexibility of the molecule yields an in-situ electric tunability of the\nexchange coupling via the gate electrode. These findings open a route to the\ncontrolled reversal of the magnetic states in organic molecule-based\nnanodevices by mechanical means, electrical gating or chemical tailoring.\n", "  The detection of gravitationally redshifted optical emission lines has been\nreported just for a few active galaxies. In this paper we give a short overview\nof studies that analyzed or exploited the detection of the gravitational\nredshift in optical AGN spectra. In addition, we tested the consistency of\ngravitational redshift as the physical origin of the redward shifts observed in\ntheir spectra using a sample of $\\approx$ 50 Hamburg-ESO intermediate to high\nredshift quasars that are among the most luminous quasars known ($10^{47}\n\\lesssim L \\lesssim 10^{48}$ erg/s), and are expected to host very massive\nblack holes. To this aim we modeled the line profile with accretion disk models\naround a black hole.\n", "  Detection of 54 very high-energy (VHE) neutrinos by the IceCube Neutrino\nObservatory has opened a new chapter in multi-messenger astronomy. However due\nto large errors in measuring the directions of the neutrino shower-type events,\nwhich dominate the current event list, it is difficult to identify their\nastrophysical sources. We perform cross-correlation study of IceCube neutrino\nevents with extragalactic candidate sources using X-ray and gamma-ray selected\nsource catalogues such as Swift-BAT, 3LAC and TeV-Cat. We apply different cuts\non the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes of the sources in these catalogs, and use\ndifferent source classes in order to study correlation. We use invariant\nstatistic and Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate statistical significance of\nany correlation.\n", "  Molecular gastronomy is a distinct sub-discipline of food science that takes\nan active role in examining chemical and physical properties of ingredients and\nas such lends itself to more scientific approaches to finding novel ingredient\npairings. With thousands of ingredients and molecules, which participate in the\ncreation of each ingredient's flavour, it can be difficult to find compatible\nflavours in an efficient manner. Existing literature is focused mainly on\nanalysis of already established cuisine based on the flavour profile of its\ningredients, but fails to consider the potential in finding flavour\ncompatibility for use in creation of completely new recipes. Expressing\nrelationships between ingredients and their molecular structure as a bipartite\nnetwork opens up this problem to effective analysis with methods from network\nscience. We describe a series of experiments on a database of food using\nnetwork analysis, which produce a set of compatible ingredients that can be\nused in creation of new recipes. We expect this approach and its results to\ndramatically simplify the creation of new recipes with previously unseen and\nfresh combinations of ingredients.\n", "  Methods based on propagation of the one-body reduced density-matrix hold much\npromise for the simulation of correlated many-electron dynamics far from\nequilibrium, but difficulties with finding good approximations for the\ninteraction term in its equation of motion have so far impeded their\napplication. These difficulties include the violation of fundamental physical\nprinciples such as energy conservation, positivity conditions on the density,\nor unchanging natural orbital occupation numbers. We review some of the recent\nefforts to confront these problems, and explore a semiclassical approximation\nfor electron correlation coupled to time-dependent Hartree-Fock propagation. We\nfind that this approach captures changing occupation numbers, and excitations\nto doubly-excited states, improving over TDHF and adiabatic approximations in\ndensity-matrix propagation. However, it does not guarantee $N$-representability\nof the density-matrix, consequently resulting sometimes in violation of\npositivity conditions, even though a purely semiclassical treatment preserves\nthese conditions.\n", "  The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that in social networks, people on\naverage have fewer friends than their friends do. The generalized friendship\nparadox is an extension to attributes other than the number of friends. The\nfriendship paradox and its generalized version have gathered recent attention\ndue to the information they provide about network structure and local\ninequalities. In this paper, we propose several measures of nodal qualities\nwhich capture different aspects of their activities and influence in online\nsocial networks. Using these measures we analyse the prevalence of the\ngeneralized friendship paradox over Twitter and we report high levels of\nprevalence (up to over 90\\% of nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the\nfriendship paradox and its generalized version arise because of the\nhierarchical nature of the connections in the network. This hierarchy is nested\nas opposed to being star-like. We conclude that these paradoxes are collective\nphenomena not created merely by a minority of well-connected or high-attribute\nnodes. Moreover, our results show that a large fraction of individuals can\nexperience the generalized friendship paradox even in the absence of a\nsignificant correlation between degrees and attributes.\n", "  In this paper, we have calculated the energy spectrum of 12C isotope by\ncluster model. The experimental results show that the \"Hoyle\" state at 7.65 MeV\nin 12C isotope has a well-developed three-alpha structure. Hence, we select a\nthree-body system and for interaction between the clusters we use modified\nYukawa potential plus coulomb potential. Then, we solve the relativistic\nKlein-Gordon equation using Nikiforov-Uvarov method to calculate the energy\nspectrum. Finally, the calculated results are compared with the experimental\ndata. The results show that the isotope 12C should be considered as consisting\nof three-alpha cluster and the modified Yukawa potential is adaptable for\ncluster interactions.\n", "  Precise patient positioning and thus precise positioning of the planning\ntarget volume (PTV) is a prerequisite for effective treatment in percutaneous\nradiation therapy. Conventional imaging modalities used to ensure exact\npositioning for treatment typically involve additional radiation exposure of\nthe patient. A different approach to patient alignment without additional\nexposure is provided by optical 3D surface scanning and registration systems.\n  We investigated two systems Catalyst and AlignRT, which allowed us to\ngenerate and validate surface images of 50 patients undergoing irradiation on a\nTomotherapy system. We compared the positions proposed by these two surface\nimaging systems (SIS) with the actual adjustments in patient positions made on\nthe basis of MVCT scans. With the two SIS, the surface of every single patient\nwas repeatedly recorded throughout treatment. In addition, we performed a\nsystematic analysis of both systems using a body phantom.\n  At least 10 surface images were available from each patient included in the\nanalysis. The large number of patients allowed us to subdivide the study\npopulation into three groups by body region treated: head & neck, chest, and\npelvic. The results for each of these three body regions were separately\nanalyzed. Thus, the focus of our investigation is on body regions registered\nwith the two systems rather than tumor entities. For AlignRT, for instance, we\nfound an improvement in positioning for the Pelvic region of 0.9mm in 75% and\n6.4mm in 95% of the collected data in comparison to conventional marker\nalignment.\n  The two systems were most accurate in the head & neck region, where\nconventional mask alignment is already sufficiently accurate. The other two\nbody regions, pelvic and chest, might benefit from positioning by SIS. But for\nboth systems there is still a need for improvement to reduce statistical\nvariation.\n", "  In this paper we propose a new method to detect and classify coexisting\nsolutions in nonlinear systems. We focus on mechanical and structural systems\nwhere we usually avoid multistability for safety and reliability. We want to be\nsure that in the given range of parameters and initial conditions the expected\nsolution is the only possible or at least has dominant basin of attraction. We\npropose an algorithm to estimate the probability of reaching the solution in\ngiven (accessible) ranges of initial conditions and parameters. We use a\nmodified method of basin stability (Menck et. al., Nature Physics, 9(2) 2013).\nIn our investigation we examine three different systems: a Duffing oscillator\nwith a tuned mass absorber, a bilinear impacting oscillator and a beam with\nattached rotating pendula. We present the results that prove the usefulness of\nthe proposed algorithm and highlight its strengths in comparison with classical\nanalysis of nonlinear systems (analytical solutions, path-following, basin of\nattraction ect.). We show that with relatively small computational effort\n(comparing to classical analysis) we can predict the behaviour of the system\nand select the ranges in parameter's space where the system behaves in a\npresumed way. The method can be used in all types of nonlinear complex systems.\n", "  The numerical simulation of the nonlinear dynamics of the sea surface has\nshown that the collision of two groups of relatively low waves with close but\nnoncollinear wave vectors (two or three waves in each group with a steepness of\nabout 0.2) can result in the appearance of an individual anomalous wave whose\nheight is noticeably larger than that in the linear theory. Since such\ncollisions quite often occur on the ocean surface, this scenario of the\nformation of rogue waves is apparently most typical under natural conditions.\n", "  In the aforementioned paper, the authors claim that my results concerning the\nconsequent application of Garrett's method for obtaining approximate\nexpressions of the bound states energy of a particle in a finite rectangular\nwell are incorrect. I shall show hat this is not the case, and demonstrate that\nboth their and my results lead to the same conclusion, i.e. that the consequent\napplication of Garrett's method is equivalent to Barker's approximation.\n", "  Differential measurements of particle collisions or decays can provide\nstringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.\nIn particular, the distributions of the kinematical and angular variables that\ncharacterise heavy me- son multibody decays are non trivial and can sign the\nunderlying interaction physics. In the era of high luminosity opened by the\nadvent of the Large Hadron Collider and of Flavor Factories, differential\nmeasurements are less and less dominated by statistical precision and require a\nprecise determination of efficiencies that depend simultaneously on several\nvariables and do not factorise in these variables. This docu- ment is a\nreflection on the potential of multivariate techniques for the determination of\nsuch multidimensional efficiencies. We carried out two case studies that show\nthat multilayer perceptron neural networks can determine and correct for the\ndistortions introduced by reconstruction and selection criteria in the\nmultidimensional phase space of the decays $B^{0}\\rightarrow K^{*0}(\\rightarrow\nK^{+}\\pi^{-}) \\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ and $D^{0}\\rightarrow\nK^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, at the price of a minimal analysis effort. We\nconclude that this method can already be used for measurements which\nstatistical precision does not yet reach the percent level and that with more\nsophisticated machine learning methods, the aforementioned potential is very\npromising.\n", "  We demonstrate a novel technique to fabricate mechanically tunable slippery\nsurfaces using one dimensional (anisotropic) elastic wrinkles. Such wrinkles\nshow tunable topography (amplitude) on the application of mechanical strain.\nFollowing Nepenthes pitcher plants, lubricating fluid infused solid surfaces\nshow excellent slippery behavior for test liquid drops. Therefore combining the\nabove two i.e. infusing suitable lubricating fluid on elastic wrinkles would\nenable us to fabricate mechanically tunable slippery surfaces. Completely\nstretched (flat) wrinkles have uniform coating of lubricating fluid whereas\ncompletely relaxed (full amplitude) wrinkles have most of the lubricating oil\nin the wrinkle grooves. Therefore water drops on completely stretched surface\nshow excellent slippery behavior whereas on completely relaxed surface they\nshow very poor slippery behavior. Therefore continuous variation of wrinkle\nstretching provide reversibly tunable slippery behavior on such system. Since\nthe winkles are one dimensional, they show anisotropic tunability of slippery\nbehavior depending upon whether test liquid drops slip parallel or\nperpendicular to the wrinkles.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a model of spatial network growth in which nodes\nare placed at randomly selected locations on a unit square in $\\mathbb{R}^2$,\nforming new connections to old nodes subject to the constraint that edges do\nnot cross. The resulting network has a power law degree distribution, high\nclustering and the small world property. We argue that these characteristics\nare a consequence of the two defining features of the network formation\nprocedure; growth and planarity conservation. We demonstrate that the model can\nbe understood as a variant of random Apollonian growth and further propose a\none parameter family of models with the Random Apollonian Network and the\nDeterministic Apollonian Network as extreme cases and our model as a midpoint\nbetween them. We then relax the planarity constraint by allowing edge crossings\nwith some probability and find a smooth crossover from power law to exponential\ndegree distributions when this probability is increased.\n", "  Molecular simulations can provide microscopic insight into the physical and\nchemical driving forces of complex molecular processes. Despite continued\nadvancement of simulation methodology, model errors may lead to inconsistencies\nbetween simulated and reference (e.g., from experiments or higher-level\nsimulations) observables. To bound the microscopic information generated by\ncomputer simulations within reference measurements, we propose a method that\nreweights the microscopic transitions of the system to improve consistency with\na set of coarse kinetic observables. The method employs the well-developed\nMarkov state modeling framework to efficiently link microscopic dynamics with\nlong-time scale constraints, thereby consistently addressing a wide range of\ntime scales. To emphasize the robustness of the method, we consider two\ndistinct coarse-grained models with significant kinetic inconsistencies. When\napplied to the simulated conformational dynamics of small peptides, the\nreweighting procedure systematically improves the time scale separation of the\nslowest processes. Additionally, constraining the forward and backward rates\nbetween metastable states leads to slight improvement of their relative\nstabilities and, thus, refined equilibrium properties of the resulting model.\nFinally, we find that difficulties in simultaneously describing both the\nsimulated data and the provided constraints can help identify specific\nlimitations of the underlying simulation approach.\n", "  Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) at a wavelength of\n532 nm were designed and fabricated aiming to satellite laser ranging (SLR)\napplications. The NbN SNSPDs were fabricated on one-dimensional photonic\ncrystals with a sensitive-area diameter of 42 um. The devices were coupled with\nmultimode fiber (phi=50um) and exhibited a maximum system detection efficiency\nof 75% at an extremely low dark count rate of <0.1 Hz. An SLR experiment using\nan SNSPD at a wavelength of 532 nm was successfully demonstrated. The results\nshowed a depth ranging with a precision of ~8.0 mm for the target satellite\nLARES, which is ~3,000 km away from the ground ranging station at the Sheshan\nObservatory.\n", "  In many transition metal oxides (TMOs), oxygen stoichiometry is one of the\nmost critical parameters that plays a key role in determining the structural,\nphysical, optical, and electrochemical properties of the material. However,\ncontrolling the growth to obtain high quality single crystal films having the\nright oxygen stoichiometry, especially in a high vacuum environment, has been\nviewed as a challenge. In this work, we show that through proper control of the\nplume kinetic energy, stoichiometric crystalline films can be synthesized\nwithout generating oxygen defects, even in high vacuum. We use a model\nhomoepitaxial system of SrTiO3 (STO) thin films on single crystal STO\nsubstrates. Physical property measurements indicate that oxygen vacancy\ngeneration in high vacuum is strongly influenced by the energetics of the laser\nplume, and it can be controlled by proper laser beam delivery. Therefore, our\nfinding not only provides essential insight into oxygen stoichiometry control\nin high vacuum for understanding the fundamental properties of STO-based thin\nfilms and heterostructures, but expands the utility of pulsed laser epitaxy of\nother materials as well.\n", "  Developing an understanding of how magnetic fields can become entangled in a\nprominence is important for predicting a possible eruption. This work\ninvestigates the kinetic energy and vorticity associated with plasma motion\nresiding inside quiescent prominences (QPs). These plasma flow characteristics\ncan be utilized to improve our understanding of how the prominence maintains a\nstable magnetic field configuration. Three different contrast-enhanced solar\nprominence observations from Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope were used to\nconstruct velocity maps -- in the plane of the sky -- via a Fourier local\ncorrelation tracking program. The resulting velocities were then used to\nperform the first ever analysis of the two-dimensional kinetic energy and\nenstrophy spectra of a prominence. Enstrophy is introduced here as a means of\nquantifying the vorticity that has been observed in many QPs. The kinetic\nenergy power spectral density (PSD) produced indices ranging from -1.00 to\n-1.60. There was a consistent anisotropy in the kinetic energy spectrum of all\nthree prominences examined. Examination of the intensity PSD reveals that a\ndifferent scaling relationship exists between the observed prominence structure\nand velocity maps. All of the prominences exhibited an inertial range of at\nleast $0.8 \\leq k\\leq 2.0\\; \\textrm{rads} \\: \\textrm{Mm}^{-1}$. Quasi-periodic\noscillations were also detected in the centroid of the velocity distributions\nfor one prominence. Additionally, a lower limit was placed on the kinetic\nenergy density ($\\epsilon \\, \\sim 0.22-7.04\\: \\mathrm{km}^{2}\\textrm{s}^{-2}$)\nand enstrophy density ($\\omega \\, \\sim 1.43-13.69\\: \\times 10^{-16} \\,\n\\textrm{s}^{-2}$) associated with each prominence.\n", "  The self-excitation of Plasma Series Resonance (PSR) oscillations plays an\nimportant role in the electron heating dynamics in Capacitively Coupled Radio\nFrequency (CCRF) plasmas. In a combined approach of PIC/MCC simulations and a\ntheoretical model based on an equivalent circuit, we investigate the\nself-excitation of PSR oscillations and their effect on the electron heating in\ngeometrically symmetric CCRF plasmas driven by multiple consecutive harmonics.\nThe discharge symmetry is controlled via the Electrical Asymmetry Effect, i.e.\nby varying the total number of harmonics and tuning the phase shifts between\nthem. It is demonstrated that PSR oscillations will be self-excited under both\nsymmetric and asymmetric conditions, if (i) the charge-voltage relation of the\nplasma sheaths deviates from a simple quadratic behavior and if (ii) the\ninductance of the plasma bulk exhibits a temporal modulation. These two effects\nhave been neglected up to now, but we show that they must be included in the\nmodel in order to properly describe the nonlinear series resonance circuit and\nreproduce the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, which are observed in the\nelectron current density resulting from simulations of geometrically symmetric\nCCRF plasmas. Furthermore, the effect of the PSR self-excitation on the\ndischarge current and the plasma properties, such as the potential profile, is\nillustrated by applying Fourier analysis. High frequency oscillations in the\nentire spectrum between the applied frequencies and the local electron plasma\nfrequency are observed. As a consequence, the electron heating is strongly\nenhanced by the presence of PSR oscillations.\n", "  Strain is known to greatly influence low temperature oxygen electrocatalysis\non noble metal films, leading to significant enhancements in bifunctional\nactivity essential for fuel cells and metal-air batteries. However, its\ncatalytic impact on transition metal oxide thin films, such as perovskites, is\nnot widely understood. Here, we epitaxially strain the conducting perovskite\nLaNiO3 to systematically determine its influence on both the oxygen reduction\nand oxygen evolution reaction. Uniquely, we found that compressive strain could\nsignificantly enhance both reactions, yielding a bifunctional catalyst that\nsurpasses the performance of noble metals such as Pt. We attribute the improved\nbifunctionality to strain-induced splitting of the eg orbitals, which can\ncustomize orbital asymmetry at the surface. Analogous to strain-induced shifts\nin the d-band center of noble metals relative to Fermi level, such splitting\ncan dramatically affect catalytic activity in this perovskite and other\npotentially more active oxides.\n", "  In the chameleon mechanism, a field (typically scalar) has a mass that\ndepends on the matter density of the environment: the larger is the matter\ndensity, the larger is the mass of the chameleon. We briefly review some\naspects of chameleonic theories. In particular, in a typical class of these\ntheories, we discuss the lagrangian, the role of conformal transformations, the\nequation of motion and the thin-shell effect. We also discuss $f(R)$ theories\nand chameleonic quantum gravity.\n", "  We report on the experimental observation of temporal cavity soliton\ndestabilization via spatiotemporal chaos in a coherently-driven optical fiber\nring resonator. Numerical simulations and theoretical analyses are in good\nagreement with experimental observations.\n", "  We measure cosmological parameters using the three-dimensional power spectrum\nP(k) from over 200,000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in\ncombination with WMAP and other data. Our results are consistent with a\n``vanilla'' flat adiabatic Lambda-CDM model without tilt (n=1), running tilt,\ntensor modes or massive neutrinos. Adding SDSS information more than halves the\nWMAP-only error bars on some parameters, tightening 1 sigma constraints on the\nHubble parameter from h~0.74+0.18-0.07 to h~0.70+0.04-0.03, on the matter\ndensity from Omega_m~0.25+/-0.10 to Omega_m~0.30+/-0.04 (1 sigma) and on\nneutrino masses from <11 eV to <0.6 eV (95%). SDSS helps even more when\ndropping prior assumptions about curvature, neutrinos, tensor modes and the\nequation of state. Our results are in substantial agreement with the joint\nanalysis of WMAP and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, which is an impressive\nconsistency check with independent redshift survey data and analysis\ntechniques. In this paper, we place particular emphasis on clarifying the\nphysical origin of the constraints, i.e., what we do and do not know when using\ndifferent data sets and prior assumptions. For instance, dropping the\nassumption that space is perfectly flat, the WMAP-only constraint on the\nmeasured age of the Universe tightens from t0~16.3+2.3-1.8 Gyr to\nt0~14.1+1.0-0.9 Gyr by adding SDSS and SN Ia data. Including tensors, running\ntilt, neutrino mass and equation of state in the list of free parameters, many\nconstraints are still quite weak, but future cosmological measurements from\nSDSS and other sources should allow these to be substantially tightened.\n", "  As part of an extensive multi-wavelength monitoring campaign, the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer satellite was used to observe the broad-line\nradio galaxy 3C 390.3 during the period 1994 December 31 to 1996 March 5.\nSpectra were obtained every 6-10 days. The UV continuum varied by a factor of 7\nthrough the campaign, while the broad emission-lines varied by factors of 2-5.\nUnlike previously monitored Seyfert 1 galaxies, in which the X-ray continuum\ngenerally varies with a larger amplitude than the UV, in 3C 390.3 the UV\ncontinuum light-curve is similar in both amplitude and shape to the X-ray\nlight-curve observed by ROSAT. The UV broad emission-line variability lags that\nof the UV continuum by 35-70 days for Ly-alpha and CIV 1549; values larger than\nthose found for Seyfert 1 galaxies of comparable UV luminosity. These lags are\nalso larger than those found for the Balmer lines in 3C 390.3 over the same\nperiod. The red and blue wings of CIV and Ly-alpha vary in phase, suggesting\nthat radial motion does not dominate the kinematics of the UV line-emitting\ngas. Comparison with archival data provides evidence for velocity-dependent\nchanges in the Ly-alpha and CIV line profiles, indicating evolution in the\ndetailed properties and/or distribution of the broad-line emitting gas.\n", "  We show that Husain's reduction of the self-dual Einstein equations is\nequivalent to the Pleba\\'nski equation. The B\\\"acklund transformation between\nthese equations is found. Contact symmetries of the Husain-Park equation and\ncorresponding conservation laws are derived.\n", "  We present measurements of R_Kl3rad = Gamma(KL->\\pi\\ell\\nu\\gamma; Egcm > 10\nMeV)/Gamma(KL->\\pi\\ell\\nu), where ell = mu or e, and Egcm is the photon energy\nin the kaon rest frame. These measurements are based on KL decays collected in\n1997 by the KTeV (E832) experiment at Fermilab. With samples of 1385\nKL->\\pi\\mu\\nu\\gamma and 14221 KL->\\pi\\e\\nu\\gamma candidates, we find R_Km3rad =\n(0.530 +- 0.019)% and R_Ke3rad = (4.942 +- 0.062)%. We also examine\ndistributions of photon energy and lepton-photon angle.\n", "  Contents of Part 2: 11. Supersymmetric Grandunification and Fermion Masses\n(B. Bajc) 12.

The proof is\nachieved by combining a control on the non equilibrium dynamics with an\nexplicit use of the state invariance with respect to the time evolution.\n", "  We consider a stochastically perturbed reaction diffusion equation in a\nbounded interval, with boundary conditions imposing the two stable phases at\nthe endpoints. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the front separating\nthe two stable phases, as the intensity of the noise vanishes and the size of\nthe interval diverges. In particular, we prove that, in a suitable scaling\nlimit, the front evolves according to a one-dimensional diffusion process with\na non-linear drift accounting for a \"soft\" repulsion from the boundary. We\nfinally show how a \"hard\" repulsion can be obtained by an extra diffusive\nscaling.\n", "  We consider the van der Waals free energy functional in a bounded interval\nwith inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions imposing the two stable phases\nat the endpoints. We compute the asymptotic free energy cost, as the length of\nthe interval diverges, of shifting the interface from the midpoint. We then\ndiscuss the effect of thermal fluctuations by analyzing the \\phi^4_1-measure\nwith Dobrushin boundary conditions. In particular, we obtain a nontrivial limit\nin a suitable scaling in which the length of the interval diverges and the\ntemperature vanishes. The limiting state is not translation invariant and\ndescribes a localized interface. This result can be seen as the probabilistic\ncounterpart of the variational convergence of the associated excess free\nenergy.\n"]}
