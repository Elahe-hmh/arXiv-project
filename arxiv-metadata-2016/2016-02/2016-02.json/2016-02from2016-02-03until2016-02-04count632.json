Its aim is a census of the HI gas content and dynamics of\n4,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies in the Local Volume (900<cz<12,000\nkm/s). The galaxies were selected based on their total stellar mass (absolute\nz-band magnitude Mz), and are distributed evenly over the entire range of Mz\ncovered by local SDSS galaxies (-10 to -24 mag, for H0=70 km/s/Mpc). A pilot\nsurvey is being made of over 600 galaxies. NIBLES will be complementary to the\nALFALFA and EBHIS blind HI surveys, which will detect a different ensemble of\nlocal galaxies, and which our pilot survey results indicate will detect about\n40-45% of the NIBLES sample. NIBLES is an open collaboration and anyone\ninterested in the science and willing to contribute to the project is welcome\nto join the score of NIBLErS.\n", "  The hierarchical clustering inherent in Lambda-CDM cosmology seems to produce\nmany of the observed characteristics of large-scale structure. But some glaring\nproblems still remain, including the over-prediction (by a factor 10) of the\nnumber of dwarf galaxies within the virialized population of the local group.\nSeveral secondary effects have already been proposed to resolve this problem.\nIt is still not clear, however, whether the principal solution rests with\nastrophysical processes, such as early feedback from supernovae, or possibly\nwith as yet undetermined properties of the dark matter itself. In this paper,\nwe carry out a detailed calculation of the dwarf halo evolution incorporating\nthe effects of a hypothesized dark-matter decay, D -> D'+l, where D is the\nunstable particle, D' is the more massive daughter particle and l is the other,\nlighter (or possibly massless) daughter particle. This process preferentially\nheats the smaller haloes, expanding them during their evolution and reducing\ntheir present-day circular velocity. We find that this mechanism can account\nvery well for the factor 4 deficit in the observed number of systems with\nvelocity 10--20 km/s compared to those predicted by the numerical simulations,\nif dm/m_D' ~ 5-7 x 10^{-5}, where dm is the mass difference between the initial\nand final states. The corresponding lifetime tau cannot be longer than ~30 Gyr,\nbut may be as short as just a few Gyr.\n", "  The next generation of neutrino and gamma-ray detectors should provide new\ninsights into the creation and propagation of high-energy protons within galaxy\nclusters, probing both the particle physics of cosmic rays interacting with the\nbackground medium and the mechanisms for high-energy particle production within\nthe cluster. In this paper we examine the possible detection of gamma-rays (via\nthe GLAST satellite) and neutrinos (via the ICECUBE and Auger experiments) from\nthe Coma cluster of galaxies, as well as for the gamma-ray bright clusters\nAbell 85, 1758, and 1914. These three were selected from their possible\nassociation with unidentified EGRET sources, so it is not yet entirely certain\nthat their gamma-rays are indeed produced diffusively within the intracluster\nmedium, as opposed to AGNs. It is not obvious why these inconspicuous\nAbell-clusters should be the first to be seen in gamma-rays, but a possible\nreason is that all of them show direct evidence of recent or ongoing mergers.\nTheir identification with the EGRET gamma-ray sources is also supported by the\nclose correlation between their radio and (purported) gamma-ray fluxes. Under\nfavorable conditions (including a proton spectral index of 2.5 in the case of\nAbell 85, and sim 2.3 for Coma, and Abell 1758 and 1914), we expect ICECUBE to\nmake as many as 0.3 neutrino detections per year from the Coma cluster of\ngalaxies, and as many as a few per year from the Abell clusters 85, 1758, and\n1914. Also, Auger may detect as many as 2 events per decade at ~ EeV energies\nfrom these gamma-ray bright clusters.\n", "  Consecutive quantum measurements performed on the same system can reveal\nfundamental insights into quantum theory's causal structure, and probe\ndifferent aspects of the quantum measurement problem. According to the\nCopenhagen interpretation, measurements affect the quantum system in such a way\nthat the quantum superposition collapses after the measurement, erasing any\nknowledge of the prior state. We show that a sequence of measurements in a\ncollapse picture is equivalent to a quantum Markov chain, and that considering\nthe unitary evolution of quantum wavefunctions interacting consecutively with\nmore than two detectors reveals an experimentally measurable difference between\na collapse and unitary picture. The non-Markovian nature of sequential\nmeasurements that we report is consistent with earlier discoveries in optimal\nquantum state discrimination.\n", "  We present a generalized formulation of the Optimized Effective Potential\n(OEP) approach to the Self Interaction Correction (SIC) problem in Time\nDependent (TD) Density Functional Theory (DFT). The formulation relies on the\nintroduction of a double set of single electron orbitals. It allows the\nderivation of a generalized Slater approximation to the full OEP formulation,\nwhich extends the domain of validity of the standard Slater approximation. We\ndiscuss both formal aspects and practical applications of the new formalism and\ngive illustrations in cluster and molecules. The new formalism provides a\nvaluable ansatz to more elaborate (and computationally very demanding) full TD\nOEP and full TD SIC calculations especially in the linear domain.\n", "  The variation of the dimensionless fundamental physical constant mu=m_p/m_e\ncan be checked through observation of Lyman and Werner lines of molecular\nhydrogen in the spectra of distant QSOs. Our intention is to asses the accuracy\nof the investigation concerning a possible variation of mu and to provide more\nrobust results for QSO 0347-383. The goal in mind is to resolve the current\ncontroversy on variation of mu and devise explanations for the different\nfindings. We achieve this not by another single result but by providing\nalternative approaches to the problem. An analysis based on independent data\nsets of QSO 0347-383 is put forward and new approaches for some of the steps\ninvolved in the data analysis are introduced. We analyse two independent sets\nof observations of the same absorption system and for the first time we apply\ncorrections for the observed offsets between discrete spectra Drawing on two\nindependent observations of a single absorption system in QSO 0347-383 our\ndetailed analysis yields dmu/mu = 15 +/- (9_stat + 6_sys) x 10^{-6} at\nz_abs=3.025. Based on the overall goodness-of-fit we estimate the limit of\naccuracy to about 300 m/s, consisting of roughly 180 m/s due to the uncertainty\nof the fit and about 120 m/s allocated to systematics This work presents\nalternative approaches to handle systematics and introduces methods required\nfor precision analysis of QSO spectra available in the near future.\n", "  We report the first determination of the relative strong-phase difference\nbetween D^0 -> K^0_S,L K^+ K^- and D^0-bar -> K^0_S,L K^+ K^-. In addition, we\npresent updated measurements of the relative strong-phase difference between\nD^0 -> K^0_S,L pi^+ pi^- and D^0-bar -> K^0_S,L pi^+ pi^-. Both measurements\nexploit the quantum coherence between a pair of D^0 and D^0-bar mesons produced\nfrom psi(3770) decays. The strong-phase differences measured are important for\ndetermining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle gamma/phi_3 in B^- -> K^-\nD^0-tilde decays, where D^0-tilde is a D^0 or D^0-bar meson decaying to K^0_S\nh^+ h^- (h=pi,K), in a manner independent of the model assumed to describe the\nD^0 -> K^0_S h^+ h^- decay. Using our results, the uncertainty in gamma/phi_3\ndue to the error on the strong-phase difference is expected to be between 1.7\nand 3.9 degrees for an analysis using B^- K^- D^0-tilde D^0-tilde -> K^0_S pi^+\npi^- decays, and between 3.2 and 3.9 degrees for an analysis based on B^- ->\nK^- D^0-tilde, D^0-tilde -> K^0_S K^+ K^- decays. A measurement is also\npresented of the CP-odd fraction, F_-, of the decay D^0 -> K^0_S K^+ K^- in the\nregion of the phi -> K^+ K^- resonance. We find that in a region within 0.01\nGeV^2/c^4 of the nominal phi mass squared F_- > 0.91 at the 90% confidence\nlevel.\n", "  We review the methods used to test for the existence of cosmological\nbirefringence, i.e. a rotation of the plane of linear polarization for\nelectromagnetic radiation traveling over cosmological distances, which might\narise in a number of important contexts involving the violation of fundamental\nphysical principles. The main methods use: (1) the radio polarization of radio\ngalaxies and quasars, (2) the ultraviolet polarization of radio galaxies, and\n(3) the cosmic microwave background polarization. We discuss the main results\nobtained so far, the advantages and disadvantages of each method, and future\nprospects.\n", "  The dramatic confrontation between new observations and theories of the early\nand recent universe makes cosmology one of the most rapidly advancing fields in\nthe physical sciences. The universe is a unique laboratory in which to probe\nfundamental physics, the rationale being to start from fundamental physics\ninspired models and explore their consequences in sufficient quantitative\ndetail to be able to identify key astrophysical and cosmological tests of the\nunderlying theory (or developing new tests when appropriate). An unprecedented\nnumber of such tests will be possible in the coming years, by exploiting the\never improving observational data. In this spirit I will highlight some open\nissues in cosmology and particle physics and provide some motivation for this\nsymposium.\n", "  Using the 32-m Medicina, 45-m Nobeyama, and 100-m Effelsberg telescopes we\nfound a statistically significant velocity offset Delta V = 27 +/- 3 m/s\n(1sigma) between the inversion transition in NH3(1,1) and low-J rotational\ntransitions in N2H+(1-0) and HC3N(2-1) arising in cold and dense molecular\ncores in the Milky Way. Systematic shifts of the line centers caused by\nturbulent motions and velocity gradients, possible non-thermal hyperfine\nstructure populations, pressure and optical depth effects are shown to be lower\nthan or about 1 m/s and thus can be neglected in the total error budget. The\nreproducibility of Delta V at the same facility (Effelsberg telescope) on a\nyear-to-year basis is found to be very good. Since the frequencies of the\ninversion and rotational transitions have different sensitivities to variations\nin mu = m_e/m_p, the revealed non-zero Delta V may imply that mu changes when\nmeasured at high (terrestrial) and low (interstellar) matter densities as\npredicted by chameleon-like scalar field models - candidates to the dark energy\ncarrier. Thus we are testing whether scalar field models have chameleon-type\ninteractions with ordinary matter. The measured velocity offset corresponds to\nthe ratio Delta mu/mu = (mu_space - mu_lab)/mu_lab of (26 +/- 3)x10^{-9}\n(1sigma).\n", "  Let G be a split reductive group. We introduce the moduli problem of \"bundle\nchains\" parametrizing framed principal G-bundles on chains of lines. Any fan\nsupported in a Weyl chamber determines a stability condition on bundle chains.\nIts moduli stack provides an equivariant toroidal compactification of G. All\ntoric orbifolds may be thus obtained. Moreover, we get a canonical\ncompactification of any semisimple G, which agrees with the wonderful\ncompactification in the adjoint case, but which in other cases is an orbifold.\nFinally, we describe the connections with Losev-Manin's spaces of weighted\npointed curves and with Kausz's compactification of GL(n).\n", "  Inert Doublet Model (IDM) is a minimal extension of the Standard Model with\nthe second scalar doublet that may provide a Dark Matter candidate. In this\npaper we consider the different variants of the evolution of the Universe after\ninflation, that lead towards the Inert phase today.\n", "  We give here the Table of Contents of the proceedings from the workshop \"Red\nGiants as Probes of the Structure and Evolution of the Milky Way\", held in\nRoma, 15-17 November 2010. Exciting results are blooming, thanks to a\nconvergence between unprecedented asteroseismic data obtained by the satellites\nCoRoT and Kepler, and state-of-the-art models of the internal structure of red\ngiants and of galactic evolution. The pulsation properties now available for\nthousands of red giants promise to add valuable and independent constraints to\ncurrent models of structure and evolution of our galaxy. Such a close\nconnection between these domains opens a new very promising gate in our\nunderstanding of stars and galaxies. Scientists specialised in galactic\nevolution, in stellar structure, and in asteroseismology, gathered together in\nthis workshop to discuss the current status and uncertainties involved in\nmodelling the structure and evolution of red giants, as well as open questions\nregarding the study of stellar populations in the Milky Way.\n", "  Optical frequency combs allow for precise measurement of optical frequencies\nand are used in a growing number of applications beyond spectroscopy and\noptical frequency metrology. A class of compact microresonator based frequency\ncomb generators has emerged recently based on (hyper)-parametric frequency\nconversion, mediated by the Kerr-non-linearity, of a continuous wave laser\nbeam. Despite the rapid progress and the emergence of a wide variety of\nmicro-resonator Kerr-comb platforms, an understanding of the dynamics of the\nKerr comb formation is still lacking. In particular the question in which\nregime low phase noise performance can be achieved has so far not been answered\nbut is of critical importance for future application of this technology. Here\nan universal, platform independent understanding of the Kerr-comb formation\ndynamics based on experimental observations in crystalline MgF2 and planar\nSi3N4 comb generators is given. This explains a wide range of hereto not\nunderstood phenomena and reveals for the first time the underlying condition\nfor low phase noise performance.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of the linear to zigzag structural phase\ntransition exhibited by an ion chain confined in a trap with periodic boundary\nconditions. The transition is driven by reducing the transverse confinement at\na finite quench rate, which can be accurately controlled. This results in the\nformation of zigzag domains oriented along different transverse planes. The\ntwists between different domains can be stabilized by the topology of the trap\nand under laser cooling the system has a chance to relax to a helical chain\nwith nonzero winding number. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to obtain\na large sample of possible trajectories for different quench rates. The scaling\nof the average winding number with different quench rates is compared to the\nprediction of the Kibble-Zurek theory, and a good quantitative agreement is\nfound.\n", "  We study the entanglement dynamics of the two two-level atoms coupling with a\nsingle-mode polarized cavity field after incorporating the atomic centers of\nmass classical harmonic vibrations with micro amplitudes and low frequencies.\nWe propose a quantitative vibrant factor to modify the concurrence of the two\natoms states. When the vibrant frequencies are very low, we obtain that: (i)\nthe factor depends on the relative vibrant displacements and the initial phases\nrather than the absolute amplitudes, and reduces the concurrence to three\norders of magnitude; (ii) the concurrence increases with the increase of the\ninitial phases; (iii) the frequency of the harmonic vibration can be obtained\nby measuring the maximal value of the concurrence during a small time. These\nresults indicate that even the extremely weak classical harmonic vibrations can\nbe monitored by the entanglement of quantum states.\n", "  In strongly correlated systems, numerical algorithms taking parity quantum\nnumbers into account are used not only for accelerating computation by reducing\nthe Hilbert space but also for particular manipulations such as the Level\nSpectroscopy (LS) method. By comparing energy difference between different\nparity quantum numbers, the LS method is a crucial technique used in\nidentifying quantum critical points of Gaussian and\nBerezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) type quantum phase transitions. These\ntransitions that occur in many one-dimensional systems are usually difficult to\nstudy numerically. Although the LS method is an effective strategy to locate\ncritical points, it has been lacked an algorithm that can manage large systems\nwith parity quantum numbers. Here a new parity Density Matrix Renormalization\nGroup (DMRG) algorithm is discussed. The LS method is the first time performed\nby DMRG in the S=2 XXZ spin chain with uniaxial anisotropy. Quantum critical\npoints of BKT and Gaussian transitions can be located well. Thus, the LS method\nbecomes a very powerful tool for BKT and Gaussian transitions. In addition,\nOshikawa's conjecture in 1992 on the presence of an intermediate phase in the\npresent model is the first time supported by DMRG.\n", "  Recent calculations further supports the premise that large-scale synchronous\nfirings of neurons may affect molecular processes. The context is scalp\nelectroencephalography (EEG) during short-term memory (STM) tasks. The\nmechanism considered is $\\mathbf{\\Pi} = \\mathbf{p} + q \\mathbf{A}$ (SI units)\ncoupling, where $\\mathbf{p}$ is the momenta of free $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves\n$q$ the charge of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in units of the electron charge, and\n$\\mathbf{A}$ the magnetic vector potential of current $\\mathbf{I}$ from\nneuronal minicolumnar firings considered as wires, giving rise to EEG. Data has\nprocessed using multiple graphs to identify sections of data to which\nspline-Laplacian transformations are applied, to fit the statistical mechanics\nof neocortical interactions (SMNI) model to EEG data, sensitive to synaptic\ninteractions subject to modification by $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves.\n", "  Dissipative solitons can emerge in a wide variety of dissipative nonlinear\nsystems throughout the fields of optics, medicine or biology. Dissipative\nsolitons can also exist in Kerr-nonlinear optical resonators and rely on the\ndouble balance between parametric gain and resonator loss on the one hand and\nnonlinearity and diffraction or dispersion on the other hand. Mathematically\nthese solitons are solution to the Lugiato-Lefever equation and exist on top of\na continuous wave (cw) background. Here we report the observation of temporal\ndissipative solitons in a high-Q optical microresonator. The solitons are\nspontaneously generated when the pump laser is tuned through the effective zero\ndetuning point of a high-Q resonance, leading to an effective red-detuned\npumping. Red-detuned pumping marks a fundamentally new operating regime in\nnonlinear microresonators. While usually unstablethis regime acquires unique\nstability in the presence of solitons without any active feedback on the\nsystem. The number of solitons in the resonator can be controlled via the pump\nlaser detuning and transitions to and between soliton states are associated\nwith discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. Beyond enabling to\nstudy soliton physics such as soliton crystals our observations open the route\ntowards compact, high repetition-rate femto-second sources, where the operating\nwavelength is not bound to the availability of broadband laser gain media. The\nsingle soliton states correspond in the frequency domain to low-noise optical\nfrequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in\nbroadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low phase-noise\nmicrowave generation.\n", "  This paper combines several new constructions in mathematics and physics.\nMathematically, we study framed flat PGL(K,C)-connections on a large class of\n3-manifolds M with boundary. We define a space L_K(M) of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary of M that extend to M. Our goal is to understand an\nopen part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the\nK_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero. We construct an open part\nof L_K(M) from data assigned to a hypersimplicial K-decomposition of an ideal\ntriangulation of M, generalizing Thurston's gluing equations in 3d hyperbolic\ngeometry, and combining them with the cluster coordinates for framed flat\nPGL(K)-connections on surfaces. Using a canonical map from the complex of\nconfigurations of decorated flags to the Bloch complex, we prove that any\ngeneric component of L_K(M) is K_2-isotropic if the boundary satisfies some\ntopological constraints (Theorem 4.2). In some cases this implies that L_K(M)\nis K_2-Lagrangian. For general M, we extend a classic result of Neumann-Zagier\non symplectic properties of PGL(2) gluing equations to reduce the\nK_2-Lagrangian property to a combinatorial claim.\n  Physically, we use the symplectic properties of K-decompositions to construct\n3d N=2 superconformal field theories T_K[M] corresponding (conjecturally) to\nthe compactification of K M5-branes on M. This extends known constructions for\nK=2. Just as for K=2, the theories T_K[M] are described as IR fixed points of\nabelian Chern-Simons-matter theories. Changes of triangulation (2-3 moves) lead\nto abelian mirror symmetries that are all generated by the elementary duality\nbetween N_f=1 SQED and the XYZ model. In the large K limit, we find evidence\nthat the degrees of freedom of T_K[M] grow cubically in K.\n", "  This review gives a short historical account of the excitable maps approach\nfor modeling neurons and neuronal networks. Some early models, due to Pasemann\n(1993), Chialvo (1995) and Kinouchi and Tragtenberg (1996), are compared with\nmore recent proposals by Rulkov (2002) and Izhikevich (2003). We also review\nmap-based schemes for electrical and chemical synapses and some recent findings\nas critical avalanches in map-based neural networks. We conclude with\nsuggestions for further work in this area like more efficient maps,\ncompartmental modeling and close dynamical comparison with conductance-based\nmodels.\n", "  Entangled atomic states, such as spin squeezed states, represent a promising\nresource for a new generation of quantum sensors and atomic clocks. We\ndemonstrate that optimal control techniques can be used to substantially\nenhance the degree of spin squeezing in strongly interacting many-body systems,\neven in the presence of noise and imperfections. Specifically, we present a\nprotocol that is robust to noise which outperforms conventional methods.\nPotential experimental implementations are discussed.\n", "  This paper extends a recently introduced theory describing particle transport\nfor random statistically homogeneous systems in which the distribution function\np(s) for chord lengths between scattering centers is non-exponential. Here, we\nrelax the previous assumption that p(s) does not depend on the direction of\nflight \\Omega; this leads to an extended generalized linear Boltzmann equation\nthat includes angular-dependent cross sections, and to an extended generalized\ndiffusion equation that accounts for anisotropic behavior resulting from the\nstatistics of the system.\n", "  In the present article we substantially expand on our recent study about the\nfabrication of mesoscale polymeric templates of disordered photonic network\nmaterials. We present a detailed analysis and discussion of important technical\naspects related to the fabrication and characterization of these fascinating\nmaterials. Compared to our initial report we were able to reduce the typical\nstructural length scale of the seed pattern from $a=3.3\\mu m$ to $a=2\\mu m$,\nbringing it closer to the technologically relevant fiber-optic communications\nwavelength range around $\\lambda \\sim 1.5 \\mu m$. We have employed scanning\nelectron microscopy coupled with focused ion beam cutting to look inside the\nbulk of the samples of different height. Moreover we demonstrate the use of\nlaser scanning confocal microscopy to assess the real space structure of the\nsamples fabricated by direct laser writing. We address in detail question about\nscalability, finite size effects and geometrical distortions. We also study the\neffect of the lithographic voxel shape, that is the ellipsoidal shape of the\nlaser pen used in the fabrication process. To this end we employ detailed\nnumerical modelling of the scattering function using a discrete dipole\napproximation scheme.\n", "  The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state energy\n(given by the minimum eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian.\n  First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation for the\nground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following\nproperties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with\nsublinear entanglement with respect to some partition into small pieces. The\napproximation based on degree is a surprising difference between quantum\nHamiltonians and classical CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems), since in\nthe classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder CSPs.\nThe approximation based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only\nin the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence of\na low-energy product state can be checked in NP, the result implies that any\nHamiltonian used for a quantum PCP theorem should have: (1) constant degree,\n(2) constant expansion, (3) a \"volume law\" for entanglement with respect to any\npartition into small parts.\n  Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not\nonly exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on\nany planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2)\ndense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving an open problem of\nGharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold\nrank, via a quantum generalization of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and\nSteurer.\n  Our work introduces two new tools which may be of independent interest.\nFirst, we prove a new quantum version of the de Finetti theorem which does not\nrequire the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to analyze\nthe application of the Lasserre/Parrilo SDP hierarchy to local quantum\nHamiltonians.\n", "  We describe an analysis of neutron transport in the interior of model pebble\nbed reactor (PBR) cores, considering both crystal and random pebble\narrangements. Monte Carlo codes were developed for (i) generating random\nrealizations of the model PBR core, and (ii) performing neutron transport\ninside the crystal and random heterogeneous cores; numerical results are\npresented for two different choices of material parameters. These numerical\nresults are used to investigate the anisotropic behavior of neutrons in each\ncase and to assess the accuracy of estimates for the diffusion coefficients\nobtained with the diffusion approximations of different models: the atomic mix\nmodel, the Behrens correction, the Lieberoth correction, the generalized linear\nBoltzmann equation (GLBE), and the new GLBE with angular-dependent path-length\ndistributions. This new theory utilizes a non-classical form of the Boltzmann\nequation in which the locations of the scattering centers in the system are\ncorrelated and the distance-to-collision is not exponentially distributed; this\nleads to an anisotropic diffusion equation. We show that the results predicted\nusing the new GLBE theory are extremely accurate, correctly identifying the\nanisotropic diffusion in each case and greatly outperforming the other models\nfor the case of random systems.\n", "  In this paper, we obtain an infinite dimensional Lie algebra of exotic gauge\ninvariant observables that is closed under Goldman-type bracket associated with\nmonodromy matrices of flat connections on a compact Riemann surface for $G_{2}$\ngauge group. As a by-product, we give an alternative derivation of known\nGoldman bracket for classical gauge groups $GL(n,\\mathbb{R})$,\n$SL(n,\\mathbb{R})$, $U(n)$, $SU(n)$, $Sp(2n,\\mathbb{R})$ and $SO(n)$.\n", "  Detecting regional spatial structures based on spatial interactions is\ncrucial in applications ranging from urban planning to traffic control. In the\nbig data era, various movement trajectories are available for studying spatial\nstructures. This research uses large scale Shanghai taxi trip data extracted\nfrom GPS-enabled taxi trajectories to reveal traffic flow patterns and urban\nstructure of the city. Using the network science methods, 15 temporally stable\nregions reflecting the scope of people's daily travels are found using\ncommunity detection method on the network built from short trips, which\nrepresent residents' daily intra-urban travels and exhibit a clear pattern. In\neach region, taxi traffic flows are dominated by a few 'hubs' and 'hubs' in\nsuburbs impact more trips than 'hubs' in urban areas. Land use conditions in\nurban regions are different from those in suburban areas. Additionally, 'hubs'\nin urban area associate with office buildings and commercial areas more,\nwhereas residential land use is more common in suburban hubs. The taxi flow\nstructures and land uses reveal the polycentric and layered concentric\nstructure of Shanghai. Finally, according to the temporal variations of taxi\nflows and the diversity levels of taxi trip lengths, we explore the total taxi\ntraffic properties of each region and proved the city structure we find.\nExternal trips across regions also take large proportion of the total traffic\nin each region, especially in suburbs. The results could help transportation\npolicy making and shed light on the way to reveal urban structures with big\ndata.\n", "  The formation of temporal dissipative solitons in optical microresonators\nenables compact, high repetition rate sources of ultra-short pulses as well as\nlow noise, broadband optical frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes.\nHere we study the influence of the resonator mode spectrum on temporal soliton\nformation. Using frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy, the measured\nmode structure of crystalline MgF2 resonators are correlated with temporal\nsoliton formation. While an overal general anomalous dispersion is required, it\nis found that higher order dispersion can be tolerated as long as it does not\ndominate the resonator's mode structure. Mode coupling induced avoided\ncrossings in the resonator mode spectrum are found to prevent soliton\nformation, when affecting resonator modes close to the pump laser. The\nexperimental observations are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations\nbased on the nonlinear coupled mode equations, which reveal the rich interplay\nof mode crossings and soliton formation.\n", "  We present RESOLVE, a new algorithm for radio aperture synthesis imaging of\nextended and diffuse emission in total intensity. The algorithm is derived\nusing Bayesian statistical inference techniques, estimating the surface\nbrightness in the sky assuming a priori log-normal statistics. RESOLVE not only\nestimates the measured sky brightness in total intensity, but also its spatial\ncorrelation structure, which is used to guide the algorithm to an optimal\nreconstruction of extended and diffuse sources. For a radio interferometer, it\nsucceeds in deconvolving the effects of the instrumental point spread function\nduring this process. Additionally, RESOLVE provides a map with an uncertainty\nestimate of the reconstructed surface brightness. Furthermore, with RESOLVE we\nintroduce a new, optimal visibility weighting scheme that can be viewed as an\nextension to robust weighting. In tests using simulated observations, the\nalgorithm shows improved performance against two standard imaging approaches\nfor extended sources, Multiscale-CLEAN and the Maximum Entropy Method.\n", "  Many synoptic surveys are observing large parts of the sky multiple times.\nThe resulting lightcurves provide a wonderful window to the dynamic nature of\nthe universe. However, there are many significant challenges in analyzing these\nlight curves. These include heterogeneity of the data, irregularly sampled\ndata, missing data, censored data, known but variable measurement errors, and\nmost importantly, the need to classify in astronomical objects in real time\nusing these imperfect light curves. We describe a modeling-based approach using\nGaussian process regression for generating critical measures representing\nfeatures for the classification of such lightcurves. We demonstrate that our\napproach performs better by comparing it with past methods. Finally, we provide\nfuture directions for use in sky-surveys that are getting even bigger by the\nday.\n", "  In this work, we consider a two-level system (TLS) coupled to a\none-dimensional continuum of bosonic modes in a transmission line. Using the\nmaster equation approach, a method for determining the photon number\ndistribution of the scattered field is outlined. Specifically, results for the\nreflected field when driving the TLS with a coherent pulse are given. While the\none-photon probability is enhanced compared to the incident coherent field, the\nsystem is still not a good deterministic single-photon source. Extending the\nsystem to contain two separate transmission lines, however, output fields with\none-photon probabilities close to unity can be reached.\n", "  We investigate some aspects of the dynamics and entanglement of bipartite\nquantum system (atom-quantized field), coupled to a third ``external\" subsystem\n(quantized field). We make use of the Raman coupled model; a three-level atom\nin a lambda configuration interacting with two modes of the quantized cavity\nfield. We consider the far off resonance limit, which allows the derivation of\nan effective Hamiltonian of a two-level atom coupled to the fields. We also\nmake a comparison with the situation in which one of the modes is treated\nclassically rather than prepared in a quantum field (coherent state).\n", "  We construct a 1d spin chain Hamiltonian with generic interactions and prove\nthat the thermal correlation functions of the model admit an explicit random\nmatrix representation. As an application of the result, we show how the\nobservables of $U(N)$ Chern-Simons theory on $S^{3}$ can be reproduced with the\nthermal correlation functions of the 1d spin chain, which is of the XX type,\nwith a suitable choice of exponentially decaying interactions between\ninfinitely many neighbours. We show that for this model, the correlation\nfunctions of the spin chain at a finite temperature $\\beta =1$ give the\nChern-Simons partition function, quantum dimensions and the full topological\n$S$-matrix.\n", "  Decay parameter of coherence and population inversion are calculated from the\nmaster equation of a two level atom tunneling through a squeezed vacuum. Using\nthose parameters, the timescales for decoherence and zeno effect are calculated\nin the weak measurement scheme. By comparing those timescales, a certain\ncondition has been found for sustainable coherent dynamics.\n", "  Gambles are random variables that model possible changes in monetary wealth.\nClassic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility\nfunction and defines the value of a gamble as the expectation value of utility\nchanges. Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological\ncharacteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. Expectation\nvalue maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values\nare only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic\nproperties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the\nvariables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the\nrelevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of\nutility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging\nwealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be\nspecified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic \"utility functions\"\nappear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive\nand purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. We highlight inconsistencies\nthroughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that\nour perspective is legitimate. These invalidate a commonly cited argument for\nbounded utility functions.\n", "  Atom chips provide compact and robust platforms towards practical quantum\ntechnologies. A quick and faithful preparation of arbitrary input states for\nthese systems is crucial but represents a very challenging experimental task.\nThis is especially difficult when the dynamical evolution is noisy and\nunavoidable setup imperfections have to be considered. Here, we experimentally\nprepare with very high small errors different internal states of a Rubidium\nBose-Einstein condensate realized on an atom chip. As a possible application of\nour scheme, we apply it to improve the sensitivity of an atomic interferometer.\n", "  We study the structure of local algebras in relativistic conformal quantum\nfield theory with phase boundaries. Phase boundaries are instances of a more\ngeneral notion of boundaries that give rise to a variety of algebraic\nstructures. These can be formulated in a common framework originating in\nAlgebraic QFT, with the principle of Einstein Causality playing a prominent\nrole.We classify the phase boundary conditions by the centre of a certain\nuniversal construction, which produces a reducible representation in which all\npossible boundary conditions are realized. For a large class of models, the\nclassification reproduces results obtained in a different approach by Fuchs et\nal. before.\n", "  In this paper, we will first clarify the physical meaning of having a minimum\nmeasurable time. Then we will combine the deformation of the Dirac equation due\nto the existence of minimum measurable length and time scales with its\ndeformation due to the doubly special relativity. We will also analyse this\ndeformed Dirac equation in curved spacetime, and observe that this deformation\nof the Dirac equation also leads to a non-trivial modification of general\nrelativity. Finally, we will analyse the stochastic quantization of this\ndeformed Dirac equation on curved spacetime.\n", "  Literature data are collated for 38 stripped-envelope core-collapse\nsupernovae (SE SNe; i.e. SNe IIb, Ib, Ic and Ic-BL) that have good light curve\ncoverage in more than one optical band. Using bolometric corrections derived in\nprevious work, the bolometric light curve of each SN is recovered and template\nbolometric light curves provided. Peak light distributions and decay rates are\ninvestigated; SNe subtypes are not cleanly distinguished in this parameter\nspace, although some grouping of types does occur and there is a suggestion of\na Phillips-like relation for most SNe Ic-BL. The bolometric light curves are\nmodelled with a simple analytical prescription and compared to results from\nmore detailed modelling. Distributions of the explosion parameters shows the\nextreme nature of SNe Ic-BL in terms of their 56Ni mass and the kinetic energy,\nhowever ejected masses are similar to other subtypes. SNe Ib and Ic have very\nsimilar distributions of explosion parameters, indicating a similarity in\nprogenitors. SNe~IIb are the most homogeneous subtype and have the lowest\naverage values for 56Ni mass, ejected mass, and kinetic energy. Ejecta masses\nfor each subtype and SE SNe as a whole are inconsistent with those expected\nfrom very massive stars. The majority of the ejecta mass distribution is well\ndescribed by more moderately massive progenitors in binaries, indicating these\nare the dominant progenitor channel for SE SNe.\n", "  We show that a trapped ion chain interacting with an optical spin-dependent\nforce shows strong frustration effects due to the interplay between long-range\ninteractions and the dressing by optical phases. We consider a strong\nspin-phonon coupling regime and predict a quantum phase diagram with different\ncompeting magnetic and structural orders. In a highly frustrated region, the\nsystem shows enhanced quantum fluctuations and entanglement characteristic of\nspin-liquid phases. We propose and describe within a mean-field approach a\nquantum annealing process to induce a quasi-adiabatic evolution towards the\nground state.\n", "  We present the ultrarelativistic boost of the general global monopole\nsolution which is parametrized by mass and deficit solid angle. The problem is\naddressed from two different perspectives. In the first one the primary object\nfor performing the boost is the metric tensor while in the second one the\nenergy momentum tensor is used. Since the solution is sourced by a triplet of\nscalar fields that effectively vanish in the boosting limit we investigate the\nbehavior of a scalar field in a simpler setup. Namely, we perform the boosting\nstudy of the spherically symmetric solution with a free scalar field given by\nJanis, Newman and Winicour. The scalar field is again vanishing in the limit\npointing to a broader pattern of scalar field behaviour during an\nultrarelativistic boost in highly symmetric situations.\n", "  Since reionization prevents star formation in most halos below 3 x 10^9 solar\nmasses, dwarf galaxies only populate a fraction of existing dark matter halos.\nWe use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of the Local Group to study the\ndiscriminating factors for galaxy formation in the early Universe and connect\nthem to the present-day properties of galaxies and halos. A combination of\nselection effects related to reionization, and the subsequent evolution of\nhalos in different environments, introduces strong biases between the\npopulation of halos that host dwarf galaxies, and the total halo population.\nHalos that host galaxies formed earlier and are more concentrated. In addition,\nhalos more affected by tidal stripping are more likely to host a galaxy for a\ngiven mass or maximum circular velocity, vmax, today. Consequently, satellite\nhalos are populated more frequently than field halos, and satellite halos of\n10^8 - 10^9 solar masses or vmax of 12 - 20 km/s, similar to the Local Group\ndwarf spheroidals, have experienced a greater than average reduction in both\nmass and vmax after infall. They are on closer, more radial orbits with higher\ninfall velocities and earlier infall times. Together, these effects make dwarf\ngalaxies highly biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility of topological states for non-Dirac electrons.\nSpecifically it is shown that, because of the $C_{\\rm 3}$ crystal symmetry and\ntime reversal symmetry, $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbits accommodated on triangular\nlattice exhibit a quadratic band touching at $\\Gamma$ point at the Fermi level.\nWhen the atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is taken into account, a gap is\nopened resulting in a quantum spin Hall effect state. As revealed explicitly by\na $k\\cdot p$ model, the topology is associated with a meron structure in the\npseudo spin texture with vorticity two, a mechanism different from honeycomb\nlattice and the band inversion. One possible realization of this scheme is the\n1/3 coverage by Bi atom adapted on the Si[111] surface. First-principle\ncalculations are carried out, and a global gap of $\\sim 0.15$eV is observed.\nWith the Si substrate taking part in realizing the nontrivial topology, the\npresent template is expected to make the integration of topological states into\nexisting electronics and photonics technologies promising.\n", "  We consider the problem of blind ptychography, that is the joint estimation\nof an unknown object and an illumination function from diffraction intensity\nmeasurements. In ptychography, diffraction measurements from neighboring\nregions of the same object are related to each other by a pairwise relationship\nbetween overlapping frames. When the illumination is well known, the\nrelationship among frames is given by a linear projection operator. We propose\na power iteration-projection algorithm that minimizes the global pairwise\ndiscrepancy among frames. We accelerate the convergence of power method by\nsubtracting the estimated localized average transparency of the unknown object.\nThe method is effective for weakly scattering and low contrast objects or\npiecewise smooth specimens.\n", "  We have carried out a search for filamentary structures in the Taurus\nmolecular cloud using $\\rm^{13}CO$ line emission data from the FCRAO survey of\n$\\rm \\sim100 \\, deg^2$. We have used the topological analysis tool, DisPerSe,\nand post-processed its results to include a more strict definition of filaments\nthat requires an aspect ratio of at least 3:1 and cross section intensity\nprofiles peaked on the spine of the filament. In the velocity-integrated\nintensity map only 10 of the hundreds of filamentary structures identified by\nDisPerSe comply with our criteria. Unlike Herschel analyses, which find a\ncharacteristic width for filaments of $\\rm \\sim0.1 \\, pc$, we find a much\nbroader distribution of profile widths in our structures, with a peak at 0.4\npc. Furthermore, even if the identified filaments are cylindrical objects,\ntheir complicated velocity structure and velocity dispersions imply that they\nare probably gravitationally unbound. Analysis of velocity channel maps reveals\nthe existence of hundreds of `velocity-coherent' filaments. The distribution of\ntheir widths is peaked at lower values (0.2 pc) while the fluctuation of their\npeak intensities is indicative of stochastic origin. These filaments are\nsuppressed in the integrated intensity map due to the blending of diffuse\nemission from different velocities. Conversely, integration over velocities can\ncause filamentary structures to appear. Such apparent filaments can also be\ntraced, using the same methodology, in simple simulated maps consisting of\nrandomly placed cores. They have profile shapes similar to observed filaments\nand contain most of the simulated cores.\n", "  The recent mass measurements of two binary millisecond pulsars, PSR\nJ1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 with a mass M=1.97+/-0.04 Msun and M= 1.26 +/-\n0.14 Msun, respectively, indicate a wide range of masses for such objects and\npossibly also a broad spectrum of masses of neutron stars born in core-collapse\nsupernovae.\n  Starting from the zero-age main sequence binary stage, we aim at inferring\nthe birth masses of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J0751+1807 by taking the differences\nin the evolutionary stages preceding their formation into account.\n  Using simulations for the evolution of binary stars, we reconstruct the\nevolutionary tracks leading to the formation of PSR J1614-2230 and PSR\nJ0751+1807. We analyze in detail the spin evolution due to the accretion of\nmatter from a disk in the intermediate-mass/low-mass X-ray binary. We consider\ntwo equations of state of dense matter, one for purely nucleonic matter and the\nother one including a high-density softening due to the appearance of hyperons.\nStationary and axisymmetric stellar configurations in general relativity are\nused, together with a recent magnetic torque model and\nobservationally-motivated laws for the decay of magnetic field.\n  The estimated birth mass of the neutron stars PSR J0751+1807 and PSR\nJ1614-2230 could be as low as 1.0 Msun and as high as 1.9 Msun, respectively.\nThese values depend weakly on the equation of state and the assumed model for\nthe magnetic field and its accretion-induced decay.\n  The masses of progenitor neutron stars of recycled pulsars span a broad\ninterval from 1.0 Msun to 1.9 Msun. Including the effect of a slow Roche-lobe\ndetachment phase, which could be relevant for PSR J0751+1807, would make the\nlower mass limit even lower. A realistic theory for core-collapse supernovae\nshould account for this wide range of mass.\n", "  NuCraft (nucraft.hepforge.org) is an open-source Python project that\ncalculates neutrino oscillation probabilities for neutrinos from cosmic-ray\ninteractions in the atmosphere for their propagation through Earth. The\nsolution is obtained by numerically solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation. The\ncode supports arbitrary numbers of neutrino flavors including additional\nsterile neutrinos, CP violation, arbitrary mass hierarchies, matter effects\nwith a configurable Earth model, and takes into account the production height\ndistribution of neutrinos in the Earth's atmosphere.\n", "  We show that to understand the orthogonality catastrophe in the half-filled\nlattice model of spinless fermions with repulsive nearest neighbor interaction\nand a local impurity in its Luttinger liquid phase one has to take into account\n(i) the impurity scaling, (ii) unusual finite size $L$ corrections of the form\n$\\ln(L)/L$, as well as (iii) the renormalization group flow of the umklapp\nscattering. The latter defines a length scale $L_u$ which becomes exceedingly\nlarge the closer the system is to its transition into the charge-density wave\nphase. Beyond this transition umklapp scattering is relevant in the\nrenormalization group sense. Field theory can only be employed for length\nscales larger than $L_u$. For small to intermediate two-particle interactions,\nfor which the regime $L > L_u$ can be accessed, and taking into account the\nfinite size corrections resulting from (i) and (ii) we provide strong evidence\nthat the impurity backscattering contribution to the orthogonality exponent is\nasymptotically given by $1/16$. While further increasing the two-particle\ninteraction leads to a faster renormalization group flow of the impurity\ntowards the cut chain fixed point, the increased bare amplitude of the umklapp\nscattering renders it virtually impossible to confirm the expected asymptotic\nvalue of $1/16$ given the accessible system sizes. We employ the density matrix\nrenormalization group.\n", "  We propose a generalized form of entangled coherent states (ECS) and apply\nthem in a multi-arm optical interferometer to estimate multiple phase shifts.\nWe obtain the quantum Cramer-Rao bounds for both the linear and nonlinear\nparameterization protocols. Through the analysis, we find that, utilizing the\nsimultaneous estimation, this generalized form of ECS gives a better precision\nthan the generalized NOON states [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{111}, 070403\n(2013)]. Moreover, comparing with the independent estimation, both the linear\nand nonlinear protocols have the same advantage in the relation to the number\nof the parameters.\n", "  The efficient calculation of rare-event kinetics in complex dynamical\nsystems, such as the rate and pathways of ligand dissociation from a protein,\nis a generally unsolved problem. Markov state models can systematically\nintegrate ensembles of short simulations and thus effectively parallelize the\ncomputational effort, but the rare events of interest still need to be\nspontaneously sampled in the data. Enhanced sampling approaches, such as\nparallel tempering or umbrella sampling, can accelerate the computation of\nequilibrium expectations massively - but sacrifice the ability to compute\ndynamical expectations. In this work we establish a principle to combine\nknowledge of the equilibrium distribution with kinetics from fast \"downhill\"\nrelaxation trajectories using reversible Markov models. This approach is\ngeneral as it does not invoke any specific dynamical model, and can provide\naccurate estimates of the rare event kinetics. Large gains in sampling\nefficiency can be achieved whenever one direction of the process occurs more\nrapid than its reverse, making the approach especially attractive for downhill\nprocesses such as folding and binding in biomolecules.\n", "  The strong power law behavior of the specific heat jump $\\Delta C$ vs. $T_c$\n($\\Delta C/T_c \\sim T_c ^{\\alpha}, \\alpha\\approx 2$), first observed by Bud'ko,\nNi, and Canfield (BNC)[1], has been confirmed with several families of the\nFe-based superconducting compounds with a series of doping. We show here that\nthis anomalous non-BCS behavior is an intrinsic property of the multiband\nsuperconducting state paired by a dominant interband interaction ($V_{inter} >\nV_{intra}$) reflecting the relation $\\frac{\\Delta_h}{\\Delta_e} \\sim\n\\sqrt{\\frac{N_e}{N_h}}$ near $T_c$, as in the $\\pm$S-wave pairing state. Then\nthis $\\Delta C$ vs. $T_c$ relation can continuously change from the perfect BNC\nscaling to a considerable deviation at lower $T_c$ region with a moderate\nvariation of the impurity scattering rate.\n", "  On the Influence of Stochastic Moments in the Solution of the Neutron Point\nKinetics Equation\n", "  Absolute space is eliminated from the body of mechanics by gauging\ntranslations and rotations in the Lagrangian of a classical system. The\nprocedure implies the addition of compensating terms to the kinetic energy, in\nsuch a way that the resulting equations of motion are valid in any frame. The\ncompensating terms provide inertial forces depending on the total momentum P,\nintrinsic angular momentum J and intrinsic inertia tensor I. Therefore, the\nprivileged frames where Newton's equations are valid (Newtonian frames) are\ncompletely determined by the matter distribution of the universe\n(Machianization). At the Hamiltonian level, the gauge invariance leads to first\nclass constraints that remove those degrees of freedom that make no sense once\nthe absolute space has been eliminated. This reformulation of classical\nmechanics is entirely relational, since it is a dynamics for the distances\nbetween particles. It is also Machian, since the rotation of the rest of the\nuniverse produces centrifugal effects. It then provides a new perspective to\nconsider the foundational ideas of general relativity, like Mach's principle\nand the weak equivalence principle. With regard to the concept of time, the\nabsence of an absolute time is known to be a characteristic of parametrized\nsystems. Furthermore, the scale invariance of those parametrized systems whose\npotentials are inversely proportional to the squared distances can be also\ngauged by introducing another compensating term associated with the intrinsic\nvirial G (shape-dynamics).\n", "  Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has great potential in\nenhancing the information channel capacity in both classical and quantum\noptical communications. Long distance optical communication requires the\nwavelengths of light are situated in the low-loss communication windows, but\nmost quantum memories currently being developed for use in a quantum repeater\nwork at different wavelengths, so a quantum interface to bridge the wavelength\ngap is necessary. So far, such an interface for OAM-carried light has not been\nrealized yet. Here, we report the first experimental realization of a quantum\ninterface for a heralded single photon carrying OAM using a nonlinear crystal\nin an optical cavity. The spatial structures of input and output photons\nexhibit strong similarity. More importantly, single-photon coherence is\npreserved during up-conversion as demonstrated.\n", "  The global phase diagram of wetting in the two-dimensional (2d) Ising model\nis obtained through exact calculation of the surface excess free energy.\nBesides a surface field for inducing wetting, a surface-coupling enhancement is\nincluded. The wetting transition is critical (second order) for any finite\nratio of surface coupling J_s to bulk coupling J, and turns first order in the\nlimit J_s/J to infinity. However, for J_s/J much larger than 1 the critical\nregion is exponentially small and practically invisible to numerical studies. A\ndistinct pre-asymptotic regime exists in which the transition displays\nfirst-order character. Surprisingly, in this regime the surface susceptibility\nand surface specific heat develop a divergence and show anomalous scaling with\nan exponent equal to 3/2.\n", "  By continuous wave pumping of a dispersion engineered, planar silicon nitride\nmicroresonator, continuously circulating, sub-30fs short temporal dissipative\nsolitons are generated, that correspond to pulses of 6 optical cycles and\nconstitute a coherent optical frequency comb in the spectral domain. Emission\nof soliton induced Cherenkov radiation caused by higher order dispersion\nbroadens the spectral bandwidth to 2/3 of an octave, sufficient for self\nreferencing, in excellent agreement with recent theoretical predictions and the\nbroadest coherent microresonator frequency comb generated to date. In a further\nstep, this frequency comb is fully phase stabilized. The ability to preserve\ncoherence over a broad spectral bandwidth using soliton induced Cherenkov\nradiation marks a critical milestone in the development of planar optical\nfrequency combs, enabling on one hand application in e.g. coherent\ncommunications, broadband dual comb spectroscopy and Raman spectral imaging,\nwhile on the other hand significantly relaxing dispersion requirements for\nbroadband microresonator frequency combs and providing a path for their\ngeneration in the visible and UV. Our results underscore the utility and\neffectiveness of planar microresonator frequency comb technology, that offers\nthe potential to make frequency metrology accessible beyond specialized\nlaboratories.\n", "  In this work we study configurations in one-dimensional scalar field theory,\nwhich are time-dependent, localized in space and extremely long-lived called\noscillons. It is investigated how the action of changing the minimum value of\nthe field configuration representing the oscillon affects its behavior. We find\nthat one of the consequences of this procedure, is the appearance of a pair of\noscillon-like structures presenting different amplitudes and frequencies of\noscillation. We also compare our analytical results to numerical ones, showing\nexcellent agreement.\n", "  We examine the Si(111) multi-valley quantum Hall system and show that it\nexhibits an exceptionally rich interplay of broken symmetries and quantum Hall\nordering already near integer fillings $\\nu$ in the range $\\nu=0-6$. This\nsix-valley system has a large $[SU(2)]^3\\rtimes D_3$ symmetry in the limit\nwhere the magnetic length is much larger than the lattice constant. We find\nthat the discrete ${D}_3$ factor breaks over a broad range of fillings at a\nfinite temperature transition to a discrete nematic phase. As $T \\rightarrow 0$\nthe $[SU(2)]^3$ continuous symmetry also breaks: completely near $\\nu =3$, to a\nresidual $[U(1)]^2\\times SU(2)$ near $\\nu=2$ and $4$ and to a residual\n$U(1)\\times [SU(2)]^2$ near $\\nu=1$ and $5$. Interestingly, the symmetry\nbreaking near $\\nu=2,4$ and $\\nu=3$ involves a combination of selection by\nthermal fluctuations known as \"order by disorder\" and a selection by the\nenergetics of Skyrme lattices induced by moving away from the commensurate\nfillings, a mechanism we term \"order by doping\". We also exhibit modestly\nsimpler analogs in the four-valley Si(110) system.\n", "  We investigate the scaling of the escape rate from piecewise-linear dynamical\nsystems displaying intermittency due to the presence of an indifferent\nfixed-point. Strong intermittent behaviour in the dynamics can result in the\nsystem preserving an infinite measure. We define a neighbourhood of the\nindifferent fixed point to be a hole through which points escape and\ninvestigate the scaling of the rate of this escape as the length of the hole\ndecreases, both in the finite measure preserving case and infinite measure\npreserving case. In the infinite measure preserving systems we observe\nlogarithmic corrections to and polynomial scaling of the escape rate with hole\nlength. Finally we conjecture a relationship between the wandering rate and the\nobserved scaling of the escape rate.\n", "  The spin Hall effect (SHE) is one of the promising phenomena to utilize a\nspin current as spintronics devices, and the theoretical understanding of its\nmicroscopic mechanism is essential to know how to control its response.\nAlthough the SHE in multiorbital systems without inversion symmetry (IS) is\nexpected to show several characteristic properties due to the cooperative roles\nof orbital degrees of freedom and a lack of IS, a theoretical understanding of\nthe cooperative roles has been lacking. To clarify the cooperative roles, we\nstudy the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) derived by the linear-response theory\nfor a $t_{2g}$-orbital tight-binding model of the $[001]$ surface or interface\nof Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ in the presence of dilute nonmagnetic impurities. We find that\nthe band anticrossing, arising from a combination of orbital degrees of freedom\nand a lack of IS, causes an increase of magnitude and a sign change of the SHC\nat some nonmagnetic impurity concentrations. Since a similar mechanism for\ncontrolling the magnitude and sign of the response of Hall effects works in\nother multiorbital systems without IS, our mechanism provides an ubiquitous\nmethod to control the magnitude and sign of the response of Hall effects in\nsome multiorbital systems by introducing IS breaking and tuning of the\nnonmagnetic impurity concentration.\n", "  In this paper, first we show that $(\\g,[\\cdot,\\cdot],\\alpha)$ is a hom-Lie\nalgebra if and only if $(\\Lambda \\g^*,\\alpha^*,d)$ is an\n$(\\alpha^*,\\alpha^*)$-differential graded commutative algebra. Then, we revisit\nrepresentations of hom-Lie algebras, and show that there are a series of\ncoboundary operators. We also introduce the notion of an omni-hom-Lie algebra\nassociated to a vector space and an invertible linear map. We show that regular\nhom-Lie algebra structures on a vector space can be characterized by Dirac\nstructures in the corresponding omni-hom-Lie algebra. The underlying algebraic\nstructure of the omni-hom-Lie algebra is a hom-Leibniz algebra, or a hom-Lie\n2-algebra.\n", "  The Carnot cycle imposes a fundamental upper limit to the efficiency of a\nmacroscopic motor operating between two thermal baths. However, this bound\nneeds to be reinterpreted at microscopic scales, where molecular bio-motors and\nsome artificial micro-engines operate. As described by stochastic\nthermodynamics, energy transfers in microscopic systems are random and thermal\nfluctuations induce transient decreases of entropy, allowing for possible\nviolations of the Carnot limit. Despite its potential relevance for the\ndevelopment of a thermodynamics of small systems, an experimental study of\nmicroscopic Carnot engines is still lacking. Here we report on an experimental\nrealization of a Carnot engine with a single optically trapped Brownian\nparticle as working substance. We present an exhaustive study of the energetics\nof the engine and analyze the fluctuations of the finite-time efficiency,\nshowing that the Carnot bound can be surpassed for a small number of\nnon-equilibrium cycles. As its macroscopic counterpart, the energetics of our\nCarnot device exhibits basic properties that one would expect to observe in any\nmicroscopic energy transducer operating with baths at different temperatures.\nOur results characterize the sources of irreversibility in the engine and the\nstatistical properties of the efficiency -an insight that could inspire novel\nstrategies in the design of efficient nano-motors.\n", "  Dunkl processes are generalizations of Brownian motion obtained by using the\ndifferential-difference operators known as Dunkl operators as a replacement of\nspatial partial derivatives in the heat equation. Special cases of these\nprocesses include Dyson's Brownian motion model and the Wishart-Laguerre\neigenvalue processes, which are well-known in random matrix theory. It is known\nthat the dynamics of Dunkl processes is obtained by transforming the heat\nkernel using Dunkl's intertwining operator. It is also known that, under an\nappropriate scaling, their distribution function converges to a steady-state\ndistribution which depends only on the coupling parameter $\\beta$ as the\nprocess time $t$ tends to infinity. We study scaled Dunkl processes starting\nfrom an arbitrary initial distribution, and we derive expressions for the\nintertwining operator in order to calculate the asymptotics of the distribution\nfunction in two limiting situations. In the first one, $\\beta$ is fixed and $t$\ntends to infinity (approach to the steady state), and in the second one, $t$ is\nfixed and $\\beta$ tends to infinity (strong-coupling limit). We obtain the\ndeviations from the limiting distributions in both of the above situations, and\nwe find that they are caused by the two different mechanisms which drive the\nprocess, namely, the drift and exchange mechanisms. We find that the deviation\ndue to the drift mechanism decays as $t^{-1}$, while the deviation due to the\nexchange mechanism decays as $t^{-1/2}$.\n", "  We critically examine the potential to disentangle Standard Model (SM) and\nNew Physics (NP) in $B \\to K^* \\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $B\\to K^* e^+ e^-$ decays,\nfocusing on $(i)$ the LHCb anomaly, $(ii)$ the search for right-handed\ncurrents, and $(iii)$ lepton-universality violation. Restricting ourselves to\nthe large-recoil region, we advocate a parameterisation of the hadronic matrix\nelements that separates model-independent information about nonperturbative QCD\nfrom the results of model calculations. We clarify how to estimate corrections\nto the heavy-quark limit that would generate a right-handed (virtual) photon in\nthe $b\\to s\\gamma$ contribution to the decay. We then apply this approach to\nthe discussion of various sets of observables of increasing theoretical\ncleanness. First, we show that angular observables in the optimized\n$P_i^{(\\prime)}$ basis are, in general, not robust against the long-distance\nQCD effects. While a fit to data favours a NP contribution to the semileptonic\noperators of the type $\\delta C_9\\simeq-1.5$, this comes at a relatively small\nstatistical significance of $\\lesssim2 \\sigma$, once power corrections are\nproperly accounted for. Second, two of these observables, $P_1$ and $P_3^{CP}$\nare particularly clean at very low $q^2$ and sensitive probes of right-handed\nquark currents. We discuss their potential to set stringent bounds on the\nWilson coefficient $C_7^\\prime$, especially using data of the electronic mode.\nFinally, in light of the recent hint of lepton-universality violation in\n$B^+\\to K^+\\ell\\ell$, we introduce and investigate new lepton-universality\nobservables involving angular observables of the muonic and electronic modes\nand their zero crossings, and show that, if the effect is of the size suggested\nby experiment, these can clearly distinguish between different NP explanations\nin terms of underlying semileptonic operators.\n", "  Conformal quantum field theory is reviewed in the perspective of Axiomatic,\nnotably Algebraic QFT. This theory is particularly developped in two spacetime\ndimensions, where many rigorous constructions are possible, as well as some\ncomplete classifications. The structural insights, analytical methods and\nconstructive tools are expected to be useful also for four-dimensional QFT.\n", "  Using the Davies-Helffer-Sj\\\"ostrand functional calculus based on almost\nanalytic extensions, we address the following problem: Given self-adjoint\noperators $S_j$, $j=1,2$, in $\\mathcal{H}$, and functions $f$ in an appropriate\nclass, for instance, $f \\in C_0^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R})$, how to control the norm\n$\\|f(S_2) - f(S_1)\\|_{\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})}$ in terms of the norm of the\ndifference of resolvents, $\\|(S_2 - z_0 I_{\\mathcal{H}})^{-1} - (S_2 - z_0\nI_{\\mathcal{H}})^{-1}\\|_{\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})}$, for some $z_0 \\in\n\\mathbb{C}\\backslash\\mathbb{R}$. We are particularly interested in the case\nwhere $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})$ is replaced by a trace ideal,\n$\\mathcal{B}_p(\\mathcal{H})$, $p \\in [1,\\infty)$.\n", "  The polarization of electromagnetic waves in the presence of a gravitational\nwave is analyzed. The rotation of the polarization angle and the Stokes\nparameters are deduced. A possible application to the detection of stochastic\nbackground of gravitational waves is proposed as a complement to the pulsar\ntiming method.\n", "  High-redshift galaxy clusters allow us to examine galaxy formation in extreme\nenvironments. Here we compile data for 15 $z>1$ galaxy clusters to test the\npredictions from a state-of-the-art semi-analytical model of galaxy formation.\nThe model gives a good match to the slope and zero-point of the cluster red\nsequence. The model is able to match the cluster galaxy luminosity function at\nfaint and bright magnitudes, but underestimates the number of galaxies around\nthe break in the cluster luminosity function. We find that simply assuming a\nweaker dust attenuation improves the model predictions for the cluster galaxy\nluminosity function, but worsens the predictions for the red sequence at bright\nmagnitudes. Examination of the properties of the bright cluster galaxies\nsuggests that the default dust attenuation is large due to these galaxies\nhaving large reservoirs of cold gas as well as small radii. We find that\nmatching the luminosity function and colours of high-redshift cluster galaxies,\nwhilst remaining consistent with local observations, poses a challenge for\ngalaxy formation models.\n", "  Quantum tunneling, a phenomenon in which a quantum state traverses energy\nbarriers above the energy of the state itself, has been hypothesized as an\nadvantageous physical resource for optimization. Here we show that multiqubit\ntunneling plays a computational role in a currently available, albeit noisy,\nprogrammable quantum annealer. We develop a non-perturbative theory of open\nquantum dynamics under realistic noise characteristics predicting the rate of\nmany-body dissipative quantum tunneling. We devise a computational primitive\nwith 16 qubits where quantum evolutions enable tunneling to the global minimum\nwhile the corresponding classical paths are trapped in a false minimum.\nFurthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that quantum tunneling can\noutperform thermal hopping along classical paths for problems with up to 200\nqubits containing the computational primitive. Our results indicate that\nmany-body quantum phenomena could be used for finding better solutions to hard\noptimization problems.\n", "  Fluctuations in the flow velocity and magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the\nSolar System. These fluctuations are turbulent, in the sense that they are\ndisordered and span a broad range of scales in both space and time. The study\nof solar wind turbulence is motivated by a number of factors all keys to the\nunderstanding of the Solar Wind origin and thermodynamics. The solar wind\nspectral properties are far from uniformity and evolve with the increasing\ndistance from the sun. Most of the available spectra of solar wind turbulence\nwere computed at 1 astronomical unit, while accurate spectra on wide frequency\nranges at larger distances are still few. In this paper we consider solar wind\nspectra derived from the data recorded by the Voyager 2 mission during 1979 at\nabout 5 AU from the sun. Voyager 2 data are an incomplete time series with a\nvoids/signal ratio that typically increases as the spacecraft moves away from\nthe sun (45% missing data in 1979), making the analysis challenging. In order\nto estimate the uncertainty of the spectral slopes, different methods are\ntested on synthetic turbulence signals with the same gap distribution as V2\ndata. Spectra of all variables show a power law scaling with exponents between\n-2.1 and -1.1, depending on frequency subranges. Probability density functions\n(PDFs) and correlations indicate that the flow has a significant intermittency.\n", "  The analyticity of response functions and scattering amplitudes implies\npowerful relations between low-energy observables and the underlying\nshort-distance dynamics. These 'IR/UV' relations are rooted in basic physical\nprinciples, such as causality and unitarity. In this paper, we seek similar\nconnections in inflation, relating cosmological observations to the physics\nresponsible for the accelerated expansion. We assume that the inflationary\ntheory is Lorentz invariant at short distances, but allow for non-relativistic\ninteractions and a non-trivial speed of propagation at low energies. Focusing\non forward scattering, we derive a 'sum rule' which equates a combination of\nlow-energy parameters to an integral which is sensitive to the high-energy\nbehavior of the theory. While for relativistic amplitudes unitarity is\nsufficient to prove positivity of the sum rule, this is not guaranteed in the\nnon-relativistic case. We discuss the conditions under which positivity still\napplies, and show that they are satisfied by all known UV completions of\nsingle-field inflation. In that case, we obtain a consistency condition for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, which constrains the size and the sign of the\nequilateral four-point function in terms of the amplitude of the three-point\nfunction. The resulting bound rules out about half of the parameter space that\nis still allowed by current observations. Finding a violation of our\nconsistency condition would point towards less conventional theories of\ninflation, or violations of basic physical principles.\n", "  La$_3$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$ and La$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ were categorized as BCS\nsuperconductors. In a plot of the critical field $H_{c2}$ vs $T$,\nLa$_3$Ru$_4$Sn$_{13}$ displays a second superconducting phase at the higher\ncritical temperature $T_c^{\\star}$, characteristic of inhomogeneous\nsuperconductors, while La$_3$Co$_4$Sn$_{13}$ shows bulk superconductivity below\n$T_c$. We observe a decrease in critical temperatures with external pressure\nand magnetic field for both compounds with $\\frac{dT_c^{\\star}}{dP} >\n\\frac{dT_c}{dP}$. The pressure dependences of $T_c$ are interpreted according\nto the McMillan theory and understood to be a consequence of lattice\nstiffening. The investigation of the superconducting state of\nLa$_3$Co$_x$Ru$_{4-x}$Sn$_{13}$ shows a $T_c^{\\star}$ that is larger then $T_c$\nfor $x<4$. This unique and unexpected observation is discussed as a result of\nthe local disorder and/or the effect of chemical pressure when Ru atoms are\npartially replaced by smaller Co atoms.\n", "  We study the moduli space of self-dual instantons on $\\mathbb{C}P^2$. These\nare described by an ADHM-like construction which allows to compute the Hilbert\nseries of the moduli space. The latter has been found to be blind to certain\ncompact directions. In this paper we probe these, finding them to correspond to\na Grassmanian, upon considering appropriate ungaugings. Moreover, the ADHM-like\nconstruction can be embedded into a $3d$ gauge theory with a known gravity\ndual. Using this, we realize in $AdS_4/CFT_3$ (part of) the instanton moduli\nspace providing at the same time further evidence supporting the $AdS_4/CFT_3$\nduality. Moreover, upon orbifolding, we provide the ADHM-like construction of\ninstantons on $\\mathbb{C}P^2/\\mathbb{Z}_n$ as well as compute its Hilbert\nseries. As in the unorbifolded case, these turn out to coincide with those for\ninstantons on $\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_n$.\n", "  Monolayers of group 6 transition metal dichalcogenides are promising\ncandidates for future spin-, valley-, and charge-based applications. Quantum\ntransport in these materials reflects a complex interplay between real spin and\npseudo-spin (valley) relaxation processes, which leads to either positive or\nnegative quantum correction to the classical conductivity. Here we report\nexperimental observation of a crossover from weak localization to weak\nanti-localization in highly n-doped monolayer MoS2. We show that the crossover\ncan be explained by a single parameter associated with electron spin lifetime\nof the system. We find that the spin lifetime is inversely proportional to\nmomentum relaxation time, indicating that spin relaxation occurs via\nDyakonov-Perel mechanism.\n", "  As a solution to the well-known problem that the shock wave potentially\nresponsible for the explosion of a supernova actually tends to stall, we\npropose a new energy source arising from our model for dark matter. Our earlier\nmodel proposed that dark matter should consist of cm-large white dwarf-like\nobjects kept together by a skin separating two different sorts of vacua. These\ndark matter balls or pearls will collect in the middle of any star throughout\nits lifetime. At some stage during the development of a supernova the balls\nwill begin to take in neutrons and then other surrounding material. By passing\ninto a ball nucleons fall through a potential of order 10 MeV, causing a severe\nproduction of heat - of order 10 foe for a solar mass of material eaten by the\nballs. The temperature in the iron core will thereby be raised, splitting up\nthe iron into smaller nuclei. This provides a mechanism for reviving the shock\nwave when it arrives and making the supernova explosion really occur. The onset\nof the heating due to the dark matter balls would at first stop the collapse of\nthe supernova progenitor. This opens up the possibility of there being {\\em\ntwo} collapses giving two neutrino outbursts, as apparently seen in the\nsupernova SN1987A - one in Mont Blanc, and one 4 hours 43 minutes later in both\nIMB and Kamiokande.\n", "  Using a circuit QED device, we demonstrate a simple qubit measurement pulse\nshape that yields fast ring-up and ring-down of the readout resonator\nregardless of the qubit state. The pulse differs from a square pulse only by\nthe inclusion of additional constant-amplitude segments designed to effect a\nrapid transition from one steady-state population to another. Using a Ramsey\nexperiment performed shortly after the measurement pulse to quantify the\nresidual population, we find that compared to a square pulse followed by a\ndelay, this pulse shape reduces the timescale for cavity ring-down by more than\ntwice the cavity time constant. At low drive powers, this performance is\nachieved using pulse parameters calculated from a linear cavity model; at\nhigher powers, empirical optimization of the pulse parameters leads to similar\nperformance.\n", "  We investigate scaling of work and efficiency of a photonic Carnot engine\nwith the number of quantum coherent resources. Specifically, we consider a\ngeneralization of the \"phaseonium fuel\" for the photonic Carnot engine, which\nwas first introduced as a three-level atom with two lower states in a quantum\ncoherent superposition by [M. O. Scully, M. Suhail Zubairy, G. S. Agarwal, and\nH. Walther, Science {\\bf 299}, 862 (2003)], to the case of $N+1$ level atoms\nwith $N$ coherent lower levels. We take into account atomic relaxation and\ndephasing as well as the cavity loss and derive a coarse grained master\nequation to evaluate the work and efficiency, analytically. Analytical results\nare verified by microscopic numerical examination of the thermalization\ndynamics. We find that efficiency and work scale quadratically with the number\nof quantum coherent levels. Quantum coherence boost to the specific energy\n(work output per unit mass of the resource) is a profound fundamental\ndifference of quantum fuel from classical resources. We consider typical modern\nresonator set ups and conclude that multilevel phaseonium fuel can be utilized\nto overcome the decoherence in available systems. Preparation of the atomic\ncoherences and the associated cost of coherence are analyzed and the engine\noperation within the bounds of the second law is verified. Our results bring\nthe photonic Carnot engines much closer to the capabilities of current\nresonator technologies.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of different methods to synthesize\nentangled states of two superconducting resonators. These methods use\nexperimentally demonstrated interactions of resonators with artificial atoms,\nand offer efficient routes to generate nonclassical states. We analyze the\ntheoretical structure of these algorithms and their average performance for\narbitrary states and for deterministically preparing NOON states. Using a new\nstate synthesis algorithm, we show that NOON states can be prepared in a time\nlinear in the desired photon number and without any state-selective\ninteractions.\n", "  Despite of the success of the slave-boson theory in capturing qualitative\nphysics of high-temperature superconductors like cuprates, it fails to\nreproduce the correct temperature-dependent behavior of superfluid density, let\nalone the independence of the linear temperature term on doping in the\nunderdoped regimes of hole-doped cuprate, a common experimental observation in\ndifferent cuprates. It remains puzzling up to now in spite of intensive\ntheoretical efforts. For electron-doped case, even qualitative treatment is not\nreported at present time. Here we revisit these problems and provide an\nalternative superfluid density formulation by using the London relation instead\nof employing the paramagnetic current-current correlation function. The\nobtained formula, on the one hand, provides the correct temperature-dependent\nbehavior of the superfluid density in the whole temperature regime, on the\nother hand, makes the doping dependence of the linear temperature term\nsubstantially weaken and a possible interpretation for its independence on\ndoping is proposed. As an application, electron-doped cuprate is studied, whose\nresult qualitatively agrees with existing experiments and successfully explains\nthe origin of $d$- to anisotropic $s$-wave transition across the optimal\ndoping. Our result remedies some failures of the slave-boson theory as employed\nto calculate superfluid density in cuprates and may be useful in the\nunderstanding of the related physics in other strongly correlated systems, e.g.\nNa$_{x}$CoO$_{2}$$\\cdot$yH$_{2}$O and certain iron-based superconductors with\ndominating local magnetic exchange interaction.\n", "  The substrate temperature required for synthesis of graphene in an arc\ndischarge plasma was studied. It was shown that an increase of copper substrate\ntemperature up to the melting point leads to an increase in the amount of\ngraphene production and the quality of graphene sheets. Favorable range of\nsubstrate temperatures for arc-based graphene synthesis was determined, and it\nis in a relatively narrow range of about 1210-1340 K.\n", "  A single crystal of the Co2+ based pyrochlore NaCaCo2F7 was studied by\ninelastic neutron scattering. This frustrated magnet with quenched exchange\ndisorder remains in a strongly correlated paramagnetic state down to one 60th\nof the Curie-Weiss temperature. Below T_f = 2.4 K, diffuse elastic scattering\ndevelops and comprises 30 +/- 10% of the total magnetic scattering, as expected\nfor J_{eff} = 1/2 moments frozen on a time scale that exceeds \\hbar/\\delta\nE=3.8 ps. The diffuse scattering is consistent with short range XY\nantiferromagnetism with a correlation length of 16 \\AA. The momentum (Q)\ndependence of the inelastic intensity indicates relaxing XY-like\nantiferromagnetic clusters at energies below ~ 5.5 meV, and collinear\nantiferromagnetic fluctuations above this energy. The relevant XY\nconfigurations form a continuous manifold of symmetry-related states. Contrary\nto well-known models that produce this continuous manifold, order-by-disorder\ndoes not select an ordered state in NaCaCo2F7 despite evidence for weak (~12 %)\nexchange disorder. Instead, NaCaCo2F7 freezes into short range ordered clusters\nthat span this manifold.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse a three dimensional supersymmetric\nChern-Simons theory in SIM(1) superspace formalism. The breaking of the Lorentz\nsymmetry down to the SIM(1) symmetry, breaks half the supersymmetry of the\nLorentz invariant theory. So, the supersymmetry of the Lorentz invariant\nChern-Simons theory with N=1 supersymmetry will break down to N=1/2\nsupersymmetry, when the Lorentz symmetry is broken down to the SIM(1) symmetry.\nFirst, we will write the Chern-Simons action using SIM(1) projections of N=1\nsuperfields. However, as the SIM(1) transformations of these projections are\nvery complicated, we will define SIM(1) superfields which transform simply\nunder SIM(1) transformations. We will then express the Chern-Simons action\nusing these SIM(1) superfields. Furthermore, we will analyse the gauge symmetry\nof this Chern-Simons theory. This is the first time that a Chern-Simons theory\nwith N=1/2 supersymmetry will be constructed on a manifold without a boundary.\n", "  The effect of disorder for pinning models is a subject which has attracted\nmuch attention in theoretical physics and rigorous mathematical physics. A\npeculiar point of interest is the question of coincidence of the quenched and\nannealed critical point for a small amount of disorder. The question has been\nmathematically settled in most cases in the last few years, giving in\nparticular a rigorous validation of the Harris Criterion on disorder relevance.\nHowever, the marginal case, where the return probability exponent is equal to\n$1/2$, i.e. where the inter-arrival law of the renewal process is given by\n$K(n)=n^{-3/2}\\phi(n)$ where $\\phi$ is a slowly varying function, has been left\npartially open. In this paper, we give a complete answer to the question by\nproving a simple necessary and sufficient criterion on the return probability\nfor disorder relevance, which confirms earlier predictions from the literature.\nMoreover, we also provide sharp asymptotics on the critical point shift: in the\ncase of the pinning (or wetting) of a one dimensional simple random walk, the\nshift of the critical point satisfies the following high temperature\nasymptotics $$\n  \\lim_{\\beta\\rightarrow 0}\\beta^2\\log h_c(\\beta)= - \\frac{\\pi}{2}. $$ This\ngives a rigorous proof to a claim of B. Derrida, V. Hakim and J. Vannimenus\n(Journal of Statistical Physics, 1992).\n", "  Intensity mapping, which images a single spectral line from unresolved\ngalaxies across cosmological volumes, is a promising technique for probing the\nearly universe. Here we present predictions for the intensity map and power\nspectrum of the CO(1-0) line from galaxies at z ~ 2.4 -2.8, based on a\nparameterized model for the galaxy-halo connection, and demonstrate the extent\nto which properties of high-redshift galaxies can be directly inferred from\nsuch observations. We find that our fiducial prediction should be detectable by\na realistic experiment. Motivated by significant modeling uncertainties, we\ndemonstrate the effect on the power spectrum of varying each parameter in our\nmodel. Using simulated observations, we infer constraints on our model\nparameter space with an MCMC procedure, and show corresponding constraints on\nthe LIR-LCO relation and the CO luminosity function. These constraints would be\ncomplementary to current high-redshift galaxy observations, which can detect\nthe brightest galaxies but not complete samples from the faint end of the\nluminosity function. By probing these populations in aggregate, CO intensity\nmapping could be a valuable tool for probing molecular gas and its relation to\nstar formation in high-redshift galaxies.\n", "  We demonstrated theoretically that the renormalization of the electron energy\nspectrum near the Dirac point of graphene by a strong high-frequency\nelectromagnetic field (dressing field) drastically depends on polarization of\nthe field. Namely, linear polarization results in an anisotropic gapless energy\nspectrum, whereas circular polarization leads to an isotropic gapped one. As a\nconsequence, the stationary (dc) electronic transport in graphene strongly\ndepends on parameters of the dressing field: A circularly polarized field\nmonotonically decreases the isotropic conductivity of graphene, whereas a\nlinearly polarized one results in both giant anisotropy of conductivity (which\ncan reach thousands of percents) and the oscillating behavior of the\nconductivity as a function of the field intensity. Since the predicted\nphenomena can be observed in a graphene layer irradiated by a monochromatic\nelectromagnetic wave, the elaborated theory opens a substantially new way to\ncontrol electronic properties of graphene with light.\n", "  We present a deep (100 ks) Chandra observation of IDCS J1426.5+3508, a\nspectroscopically confirmed, infrared-selected galaxy cluster at $z = 1.75$.\nThis cluster is the most massive galaxy cluster currently known at $z > 1.5$,\nbased on existing Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and gravitational lensing detections.\nWe confirm this high mass via a variety of X-ray scaling relations, including\n$T_X$-M, $f_g$-M, $Y_X$-M and $L_X$-M, finding a tight distribution of masses\nfrom these different methods, spanning M$_{500}$ = 2.3-3.3 $\\times 10^{14}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, with the low-scatter $Y_X$-based mass $M_{500,Y_X} =\n2.6^{+1.5}_{-0.5} \\times 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$. IDCS J1426.5+3508 is currently the\nonly cluster at $z > 1.5$ for which X-ray, SZ and gravitational lensing mass\nestimates exist, and these are in remarkably good agreement. We find a\nrelatively tight distribution of the gas-to-total mass ratio, employing total\nmasses from all of the aforementioned indicators, with values ranging from\n$f_{gas,500}$ = 0.087-0.12. We do not detect metals in the intracluster medium\n(ICM) of this system, placing a 2$\\sigma$ upper limit of $Z(r < R_{500}) < 0.18\nZ_{\\odot}$. This upper limit on the metallicity suggests that this system may\nstill be in the process of enriching its ICM. The cluster has a dense,\nlow-entropy core, offset by $\\sim$30 kpc from the X-ray centroid, which makes\nit one of the few \"cool core\" clusters discovered at $z > 1$, and the first\nknown cool core cluster at $z > 1.2$. The offset of this core from the\nlarge-scale centroid suggests that this cluster has had a relatively recent\n($\\lesssim$500 Myr) merger/interaction with another massive system.\n", "  We introduce the basic equivariant quantity $Q$ in the gauge theory on the\nnoncommutative descrete $Z_{2}$ space, which plays an important role for the\nequivariant dimensional reduction. If the gauge configuration of the ground\nstate on the extra dimensional space is described by the equivariant $Q$, then\nthe extra dimensional space is invisible. Especially, using the equivariance\nprinciple, we show that the Yang-Mills theory on $R^{2}\\times Z_{2}$ space is\nequivalent to the Yang-Mills-Higgs model on $R^{2}$ space. It can be said that\nthis model is the simplest model of this type.\n", "  Electron-positron angular correlations were measured for the isovector\nmagnetic dipole 17.6 MeV state ($J^\\pi=1^+$, $T=1$) $\\rightarrow$ ground state\n($J^\\pi=0^+$, $T=0$) and the isoscalar magnetic dipole 18.15 MeV ($J^\\pi=1^+$,\n$T=0$) state $\\rightarrow$ ground state transitions in $^{8}$Be. Significant\ndeviation from the internal pair creation was observed at large angles in the\nangular correlation for the isoscalar transition with a confidence level of $>\n5\\sigma$. This observation might indicate that, in an intermediate step, a\nneutral isoscalar particle with a mass of 16.70$\\pm0.35 $ (stat)$\\pm 0.5 $\n(sys) MeV$/c^2$ and $J^\\pi = 1^+$ was created.\n", "  We propose a highly efficient silicene device for dual spin and valley\nfiltering. The device consists of two different barrier regions: the first is a\nregion under uniaxial strain, with an exchange field induced by adjacent top\nand bottom magnetic insulators, while the second comprises of two ferromagnetic\nstripes which produces a delta-function fringe magnetic field, and a gate\nelectrode to modify the electrochemical potential. For the first region, we\ninvestigated the effect of the uniaxial strain in inducing angular separation\nof the two valley spins in momentum-space, and further spin separation by the\nspin dependent electric potential induced by the exchange field. We then\nevaluated the delta-function magnetic field and electrochemical potential\ncombination in the second region to yield the transverse displacement for the\nselection of the requisite spin-valley combination. We demonstrated the optimal\nconditions in the first barrier to induce a highly anisotropic transmission\nprofile, which enables controllable and efficient filtering (> 90% efficiency)\nby the second region for all four spin-valley combinations. Based on the\nanalytical results, we predict the feasibility of experimental realization of\ndual spin-valley silicene-based filtering device.\n", "  We have studied the ground state properties (binding energy and charge\nradius) using relativistic mean filed formalism (RMF) for Mg-isotopes in the\nvalley of stability to drip line region. The RMF densities have been analyzed\nin context of reaction dynamics. The calculated results of\n$^{24-40}$Mg+$^{12}$C reactions at projectile energy 240 AMeV using Glauber\nmodel with the conjunction of densities from relativistic mean field formalism\nare compared with experimental data. We found remarkable agreement of estimated\nvalues of reaction cross sections with experimental data except for $^{37}$Mg\nisotope. In view of this, the halo status of $^{37}$Mg is examined through\nhigher magnitude of rms radius and small value of longitudinal momentum\ndistribution. Finally, an effort is made to explore the structure of $^{37}$Mg\nhalo candidate using Glauber few body formalism.\n", "  We carried out 2D-axisymmetric MHD simulations of core-collapse supernovae\nfor rapidly-rotating magnetized progenitors. By changing both the strength of\nthe magnetic field and the spatial resolution, the evolution of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) and its impacts upon the dynamics are\ninvestigated. We found that the MRI greatly amplifies the seed magnetic fields\nin the regime where not the Alfv\\'en mode but the buoyant mode plays a primary\nrole in the exponential growth phase. The MRI indeed has a powerful impact on\nthe supernova dynamics. It makes the shock expansion faster and the explosion\nmore energetic, with some models being accompanied by the collimated-jet\nformations. These effects, however, are not made by the magnetic pressure\nexcept for the collimated-jet formations. The angular momentum transfer induced\nby the MRI causes the expansion of the heating region, by which the accreting\nmatter gain an additional time to be heated by neutrinos. The MRI also drifts\nlow-$Y_p$ matter from the deep inside of the core to the heating region, which\nmakes the net neutrino heating rate larger by the reduction of the cooling due\nto the electron capture. These two effects enhance the efficiency of the\nneutrino heating, which is found to be the key to boost the explosion. Indeed\nwe found that our models explode far more weakly when the net neutrino heating\nis switched off. The contribution of the neutrino heating to the explosion\nenergy could reach 60\\% even in the case of strongest magnetic field in the\ncurrent simulations.\n", "  The Wigner function provides a useful quasiprobability representation of\nquantum mechanics, with applications in various branches of physics. Many nice\nproperties of the Wigner function are intimately connected with the high\nsymmetry of the underlying operator basis composed of phase point operators:\nany pair of phase point operators can be transformed to any other pair by a\nunitary symmetry transformation. We prove that, in the discrete scenario, this\npermutation symmetry is equivalent to the symmetry group being a unitary\n2-design. Such a highly symmetric representation can only appear in odd prime\npower dimensions besides dimensions 2 and 8. It suffices to single out a unique\ndiscrete Wigner function among all possible quasiprobability representations.\nIn the course of our study, we show that this discrete Wigner function is\nuniquely determined by Clifford covariance, while no Wigner function is\nClifford covariant in any even prime power dimension.\n", "  (Abridged) We detect the large-scale structure of Lya emission in the\nUniverse at redshifts z=2-3.5 by measuring the cross-correlation of Lya surface\nbrightness with quasars in SDSS/BOSS. We use a million spectra targeting\nLuminous Red Galaxies at z<0.8, after subtracting a best fit model galaxy\nspectrum from each one, as an estimate of the high-redshift Lya surface\nbrightness. The quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation we detect has a shape\nconsistent with a LambdaCDM model with Omega_M =0.30^+0.10-0.07. The predicted\namplitude of this cross-correlation is proportional to the product of the mean\nLya surface brightness, <mu_alpha>, the amplitude of mass fluctuations, and the\nquasar and Lya emission bias factors. Using known values, we infer\n<mu_alpha>(b_alpha/3) = (3.9 +/- 0.9) x 10^-21 erg/s cm^-2 A^-1 arcsec^-2,\nwhere b_alpha is the Lya emission bias factor. If the dominant sources of Lya\nemission are star forming galaxies, we infer rho_SFR = (0.28 +/- 0.07)\n(3/b_alpha) /yr/Mpc^3 at z=2-3.5. For b_alpha=3, this value is a factor of\n21-35 above previous estimates from individually detected Lya emitters,\nalthough consistent with the total rho_SFR derived from dust-corrected,\ncontinuum UV surveys. 97% of the Lya emission in the Universe at these\nredshifts is therefore undetected in previous surveys of Lya emitters. Our\nmeasurement is much greater than seen from stacking analyses of faint halos\nsurrounding previously detected Lya emitters, but we speculate that it arises\nfrom similar Lya halos surrounding all luminous star-forming galaxies. We also\ndetect redshift space anisotropy of the quasar-Lya emission cross-correlation,\nfinding evidence at the 3.0 sigma level that it is radially elongated,\nconsistent with distortions caused by radiative-transfer effects (Zheng et al.\n(2011)). Our measurements represent the first application of the intensity\nmapping technique to optical observations.\n", "  $^{19}$F NMR measurements in optimally electron-doped\nLa$_{1-y}$Y$_{y}$Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$AsO$_{0.89}$F$_{0.11}$ superconductors are\npresented. In these materials the effect of Mn doping on the superconducting\nphase is studied for two series of compounds ($y= 0$ and $y= 0.2$) where the\nchemical pressure is varied by substituting La with Y. In the $y=0.2$ series\nsuperconductivity is suppressed for Mn contents an order of magnitude larger\nthan for the $y=0$ series. For both series a peak in the $^{19}$F NMR nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ emerges upon Mn doping and gets\nsignificantly enhanced on approaching the quantum phase transition between the\nsuperconducting and magnetic phases. $^{19}$F NMR linewidth measurements show\nthat for similar Mn contents magnetic correlations are more pronounced in the\n$y=0$ series, at variance with what one would expect for $\\vec Q=(\\pi/a,0)$\nspin correlations. These observations suggest that Mn doping tends to reduce\nfluctuations at $\\vec Q=(\\pi/a,0)$ and to enhance other low-frequency modes.\nThe effect of this transfer of spectral weight on the superconducting pairing\nis discussed along with the charge localization induced by Mn.\n", "  The accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4--3658 shows peculiar low\nluminosity states known as \"reflares\" after the end of the main outburst.\nDuring this phase the X-ray luminosity of the source varies by up to three\norders of magnitude in less than 1-2 days. The lowest X-ray luminosity observed\nreaches a value of ~1e32 erg/s, only a factor of a few brighter than its\ntypical quiescent level. We investigate the 2008 and 2005 reflaring state of\nSAX J1808.4-3658 to determine whether there is any evidence for a change in the\naccretion flow with respect to the main outburst. We perform a multiwavelength\nphotometric and spectral study of the 2005 and 2008 reflares with data\ncollected during an observational campaign covering the near-infrared, optical,\nultra-violet and X-ray band. We find that the NIR/optical/UV emission, expected\nto some from the outer accretion disk shows variations in luminosity which are\n1--2 orders of magnitude shallower than in X-rays. The X-ray spectral state\nobserved during the reflares does not change substantially with X-ray\nluminosity indicating a rather stable configuration of the accretion flow. We\ninvestigate the most likely configuration of the innermost regions of the\naccretion flow and we infer an accretion disk truncated at or near the\nco-rotation radius. We interpret these findings as due to either a strong\noutflow (due to a propeller effect) or a trapped disk (with limited/no outflow)\nin the inner regions of the accretion flow.\n", "  We present a novel determination of the astrophysical uncertainties\nassociated to the secondary antiproton flux originating from cosmic-ray\nspallation on the interstellar gas. We select a set of propagation models\ncompatible with the recent B/C data from PAMELA, and find those providing\nminimal and maximal antiproton fluxes in different energy ranges. We use this\nresult to determine the most conservative bounds on relevant Dark Matter (DM)\nannihilation channels: We find that the recent claim of a DM interpretation of\na gamma-ray excess in the Galactic Center region cannot be ruled out by current\nantiproton data. Finally, we discuss the impact of the recently released\npreliminary data from AMS-02. In particular, we provide a reference model\ncompatible with proton, helium and B/C spectra from this experiment.\nRemarkably, the main propagation parameters of this model are in agreement with\nthe best fit presented in our earlier statistical analyses. We also show that\nthe antiproton-to-proton ratio does not exhibit any significant anomaly at high\nenergy with respect to our predictions.\n", "  We study the dynamical instabilities of superfluid flows in the S=1\nBose-Hubbard model. The time evolution of each spin component in a condensate\nis calculated based on the dynamical Gutzwiller approximation for a wide range\nof interactions, from a weakly correlated regime to a strongly correlated\nregime near the Mott-insulator transition. Owing to the spin-dependent\ninteractions, the superfluid flow of the spin-1 condensate decays at a\ndifferent critical momentum from a spinless case when the interaction strength\nis the same. We furthermore calculate the dynamical phase diagram of this model\nand clarify that the obtained phase boundary has very different features\ndepending on whether the average number of particles per site is even or odd.\nFinally, we analyze the density and spin modulations that appear in association\nwith the dynamical instability. We find that spin modulations are highly\nsensitive to the presence of a uniform magnetic field.\n", "  The Vertical Shear Instability is one of two known mechanisms potentially\nactive in the so-called dead zones of protoplanetary accretion disks. A recent\nanalysis indicates that a subset of unstable modes shows unbounded growth -\nboth as resolution is increased and when the nominal lid of the atmosphere is\nextended, possibly indicating ill-posedness in previous attempts of linear\nanalysis. The reduced equations governing the instability are revisited and the\ngenerated solutions are examined using both the previously assumed separable\nforms and an improved non-separable solution form that is herewith introduced.\nAnalyzing the reduced equations using the separable form shows that, while the\nlow-order body modes have converged eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (as both the\nvertical boundaries of the atmosphere are extended and with increased radial\nresolution), it is also confirmed that the corresponding high-order body modes\nand the surface modes do indeed show unbounded growth rates. However, the\nenergy contained in both the higher-order body modes and surface modes\ndiminishes precipitously due to the disk's Gaussian density profile. Most of\nthe energy of the instability is contained in the low-order modes. An\ninseparable solution form is introduced which filters out the inconsequential\nsurface modes leaving only body modes (both low and high-order ones). The\nanalysis predicts a fastest growing mode with a specific radial length scale.\nThe growth rates associated with the fundamental corrugation and breathing\nmodes matches the growth and length scales observed in previous nonlinear\nstudies of the instability.\n", "  We study semi-inclusive DIS with a transversely polarized target in the\napproach of collinear factorization. The effects related with the transverse\npolarization are at twist-3. We derive the complete result of twist-3\ncontributions to the relevant hadronic tensor at leading order of $\\alpha_s$,\nand construct correspondingly experimental observables. Measuring these\nobservables will help to extract the twist-2 transversity distribution, twist-3\ndistributions and twist-3 fragmentation functions of the produced unpolarized\nhadron. A detailed comparison with the approach of\ntransverse-momentum-dependent factorization is made.\n", "  In a series of recent papers Kallosh, Linde, and collaborators have provided\na unified description of single-field inflation with several types of\npotentials, ranging from power law to supergravity, in terms of just one\nparameter $\\alpha$. These so-called $\\alpha$-attractors predict a spectral\nindex $n_{s}$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, which are fully compatible with\nthe latest Planck data. The only common feature of all $\\alpha$-attractors is a\nnon-canonical kinetic term with a pole, and a potential analytic around the\npole. In this paper, starting from the same Einstein frame with a non-canonical\nscalar kinetic energy, we explore the case of non-analytic potentials. We find\nthe functional form that corresponds to quasi-scale invariant gravitational\nmodels in the Jordan frame, characterised by a universal relation between $r$\nand $n_{s}$ that fits the observational data but is clearly distinct from the\none of the $\\alpha$-attractors. It is known that the breaking of the exact\nclassical scale-invariance in the Jordan frame can be attributed to one-loop\ncorrections. Therefore we conclude that there exists a class of non-analytic\npotentials in the non-canonical Einstein frame that are physically equivalent\nto a class of models in the Jordan frame, with scale-invariance softly broken\nby one-loop quantum corrections.\n", "  We present the first cosmological measurement derived from a galaxy density\nfield subject to a `clipping' transformation. By enforcing an upper bound on\nthe galaxy number density field in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (GAMA),\ncontributions from the nonlinear processes of virialisation and galaxy bias are\ngreatly reduced. This leads to a galaxy power spectrum which is easier to\nmodel, without calibration from numerical simulations.\n  We develop a theoretical model for the power spectrum of a clipped field in\nredshift space, which is exact for the case of anisotropic Gaussian fields.\nClipping is found to extend the applicability of the conventional Kaiser\nprescription by more than a factor of three in wavenumber, or a factor of\nthirty in terms of the number of Fourier modes. By modelling the galaxy power\nspectrum on scales k < 0.3 h/Mpc and density fluctuations $\\delta_g < 4$ we\nmeasure the normalised growth rate $f\\sigma_8(z = 0.18) = 0.29 \\pm 0.10$.\n", "  Active systems, from bacterial suspensions to cellular monolayers, are\ncontinuously driven out of equilibrium by local injection of energy from their\nconstituent elements and exhibit turbulent-like and chaotic patterns. Here we\ndemonstrate both theoretically and through numerical simulations, that the\ncrossover between wet active systems, whose behaviour is dominated by\nhydrodynamics, and dry active matter where any flow is screened, can be\nachieved by using friction as a control parameter. Moreover we discover\nunexpected vortex ordering at this wet-dry crossover. We show that the self\norganisation of vortices into lattices is accompanied by the spatial ordering\nof topological defects leading to active crystal-like structures. The emergence\nof vortex lattices, which leads to the positional ordering of topological\ndefects, suggests potential applications in the design and control of active\nmaterials.\n", "  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) drives vigorous turbulence in a\nregion of protoplanetary disks where the ionization fraction is sufficiently\nhigh. It has recently been shown that the electric field induced by the MRI can\nheat up electrons and thereby affect the ionization balance in the gas. In\nparticular, in a disk where abundant dust grains are present, the electron\nheating causes a reduction of the electron abundance, thereby preventing\nfurther growth of the MRI. By using the nonlinear Ohm's law that takes into\naccount electron heating, we investigate where in protoplanetary disks this\nnegative feedback between the MRI and ionization chemistry becomes important.\nWe find that the \"e-heating zone,\" the region where the electron heating limits\nthe saturation of the MRI, extends out up to 80 AU in the minimum-mass solar\nnebula with abundant submicron-sized grains. This region is considerably larger\nthan the conventional dead zone whose radial extent is $\\sim20$ AU in the same\ndisk model. Scaling arguments show that the MRI turbulence in the e-heating\nzone should have a significantly lower saturation level. Submicron-sized grains\nin the e-heating zone are so negatively charged that their collisional growth\nis unlikely to occur. Our present model neglects ambipolar and Hall diffusion,\nbut our estimate shows that ambipolar diffusion would also affect the MRI in\nthe e-heating zone.\n", "  The importance of shocks in nova explosions has been highlighted by Fermi's\ndiscovery of \\gamma-ray producing novae. Over three years of multi-band VLA\nradio observations of the 2010 nova V1723 Aql show that shocks between fast and\nslow flows within the ejecta led to the acceleration of particles and the\nproduction of synchrotron radiation. Soon after the start of the eruption,\nshocks in the ejecta produced an unexpected radio flare, resulting in a\nmulti-peaked radio light curve. The emission eventually became consistent with\nan expanding thermal remnant with mass $2 \\times 10^{-4} M_\\odot$ and\ntemperature $10^4$ K. However, during the first two months, the $\\gtrsim 10^6$\nK brightness temperature at low frequencies was too high to be due to thermal\nemission from the small amount of X-ray producing shock-heated gas. Radio\nimaging showed structures with velocities of 400 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc) in the\nplane of the sky, perpendicular to a more elongated 1500 km s$^{-1}$ (d/6 kpc)\nflow. The morpho-kinematic structure of the ejecta from V1723 Aql appears\nsimilar to nova V959 Mon, where collisions between a slow torus and a faster\nflow collimated the fast flow and gave rise to \\gamma -ray producing shocks.\nOptical spectroscopy and X-ray observations of V1723 Aql during the radio flare\nare consistent with this picture. Our observations support the idea that shocks\nin novae occur when a fast flow collides with a slow collimating torus. Such\nshocks could be responsible for hard X-ray emission, \\gamma -ray production,\nand double-peaked radio light curves from some classical novae.\n", "  Exploiting the Hamilton quantization in the Skyrmion thoery, we investigate\nintrinsic frequencies of baryons such as nucleon and delta particles. We find\nthat matter wave property of the baryons originates from these intrinsic\nvibrational modes defined on internal hypersphere.\n", "  Astro-H will be able for the first time to map gas velocities and detect\nturbulence in galaxy clusters. One of the best targets for turbulence studies\nis the Coma cluster, due to its proximity, absence of a cool core, and lack of\na central active galactic nucleus. To determine what constraints Astro-H will\nbe able to place on the Coma velocity field, we construct simulated maps of the\nprojected gas velocity and compute the second-order structure function, an\nanalog of the velocity power spectrum. We vary the injection scale, dissipation\nscale, slope, and normalization of the turbulent power spectrum, and apply\nmeasurement errors and finite sampling to the velocity field. We find that even\nwith sparse coverage of the cluster, Astro-H will be able to measure the Mach\nnumber and the injection scale of the turbulent power spectrum--the quantities\ndetermining the energy flux down the turbulent cascade and the diffusion rate\nfor everything that is advected by the gas (metals, cosmic rays, etc.). Astro-H\nwill not be sensitive to the dissipation scale or the slope of the power\nspectrum in its inertial range, unless they are outside physically motivated\nintervals. We give the expected confidence intervals for the injection scale\nand the normalization of the power spectrum for a number of possible pointing\nconfigurations, combining the structure function and velocity dispersion data.\nImportantly, we also determine that measurement errors on the line shift will\nbias the velocity structure function upward, and show how to correct this bias.\n", "  The linear energy dispersion of graphene electrons leads to a strongly\nnonlinear electromagnetic response of this material. We develop a general\nquantum theory of the third-order nonlinear local dynamic conductivity of\ngraphene $\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}(\\omega_1,\\omega_2,\\omega_3)$, which\ndescribes its nonlinear response to a uniform electromagnetic radiation. The\nderived analytical formulas describe a large number of different nonlinear\nphenomena such as the third harmonic generation, the four wave mixing, the\nsaturable absorption, the second harmonic generation stimulated by a dc\nelectric current, etc., which may be used in different terahertz and\noptoelectronic devices.\n", "  This work is concerned with suitable choices of tetrad fields and coordinate\nsystems for the Hamiltonian formalism of a spinning particle derived in [E.\nBarausse, E. Racine, and A. Buonanno, Phys. Rev. D 80, 104025 (2009)]. After\ndemonstrating that with the originally proposed tetrad field the components of\nthe total angular momentum are not preserved in the Schwarzschild limit, we\nanalyze other hitherto proposed tetrad choices. Then, we introduce and\nthoroughly test two new tetrad fields in the horizon penetrating Kerr-Schild\ncoordinates. Moreover, we show that for the Schwarzschild spacetime background\nthe linearized in spin Hamiltonian corresponds to an integrable system, while\nfor the Kerr spacetime we find chaos which suggests a nonintegrable system.\n", "  A unique feature of ultracold atoms is the separation of length scales,\n$r_0\\ll k_F^{-1}$, where $k_F$ and $r_0$ are the Fermi momentum characterizing\nthe average particle distance and the range of interaction between atoms\nrespectively. For $s$-wave scattering, Shina Tan discovered that such\ndiluteness leads to universal relations, all of which are governed by contact,\namong a wide range of thermodynamic quantities. Here, we show that the concept\nof contact can be generalized to an arbitrary partial-wave scattering. Contact\nof all partial-wave scatterings form a contact spectrum, which establishes\nuniversal thermodynamic relations with notable differences from those in the\npresence of $s$-wave scattering alone. Moreover, such a contact spectrum has an\ninteresting connection with a special bipartite entanglement spectrum of atomic\nquantum Hall states, and enables an intrinsic probe of these highly correlated\nstates using two-body short-ranged correlations.\n", "  We show that, for a low-mass planet that orbits its host star within a few\ntenths of an AU (like the majority of the {\\it Kepler} planets), the atmosphere\nit was able to accumulate while embedded in the proto-planetary disk may not\nsurvive unscathed after the disk disperses. This gas envelope, if more massive\nthan a few percent of the core (with a mass below $10 M_\\oplus$), has a cooling\ntime that is much longer than the time-scale on which the planet exits the\ndisk. As such, it could not have contracted significantly from its original\nsize, of order the Bondi radius. So a newly exposed proto-planet would be\nlosing mass via a Parker wind that is catalyzed by the stellar continuum\nradiation. This represents an intermediate stage of mass-loss, occurring soon\nafter the disc has dispersed, but before the EUV/X-ray driven photoevaporation\nbecomes relevant. The surface mass-loss induces a mass movement within the\nenvelope that advects internal heat outward. As a result, the planet atmosphere\nrapidly cools down and contracts, until it has reached a radius of order $0.1$\nBondi radius, at which time the mass-loss effectively shuts down. Within a\nmillion years after the disk disperses, we find a planet that has only about\nten percent of its original envelope, and a Kelvin-Helmholtz time that is much\nlonger than its actual age. We suggest that this \"boil-off\" process may be\npartially responsible for the lack of planets above a radius of $2.5 R_\\oplus$\nin the {\\it Kepler} data, provided planet formation results in initial envelope\nmasses of tens of percent.\n", "  In this contribution to the Proceedings of the Corfu Summer Institute 2015 we\npresent our study on photon self-interaction in the deformed U(1) gauge field\ntheory defined via Seiberg-Witten map. We derive the theta-exact expressions\nfor the four photon self-coupling in this theory with a large number of gauge\nsymmetry inspired freedom parameters included. The physical effect of four\nphoton self-coupling is accessed by its contribution to photon polarization\ntensor via 1-loop four-photon-tadpole-diagram. The four-photon tadpole diagram\nconsists the same tensorial structures as the photon self-interacting bubble\ndiagram we studied before, with however only quadratically IR divergent\ncoefficients. We show that there exists a unique combination of gauge symmetry\ninspired freedoms which induces full quadratic IR divergence cancellation for\narbitrary noncommutative parameter theta once the photon self-interacting\nbubble and tadpole diagrams are summed over.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of stable three dimensional dissipative\nlocalized structures in the output of a laser coupled to a distant saturable\nabsorber. These phase invariant light bullets are individually addressable and\ncan be envisioned for three dimensional optical information storage. An\neffective theory provides for an intuitive picture and allows to relate their\nformation to the morphogenesis of static auto-solitons and cellular patterns.\nThe complexity incurred by the widely different time scales present in the\nproblem as well as by non-local couplings that stem from the material degrees\nof freedom is circumvented by the use of a multiple time-scale analysis. This\nprovides a powerful model enabling to tackle effectively the three dimensional\ncase.\n", "  We consider models of supersymmetry which can incorporate sizeable mixing\nbetween different generations of sfermions. While the mixing is constrained by\nthe non-observation of various flavour changing neutral current (FCNC)\nprocesses, there exist regions of SUSY parameter space where the effects of\nsuch mixing can be probed at colliders. In this work, we explore this\npossibility by focussing on the slepton sector. The sleptons are produced\nthrough cascade decays in direct neutralino-chargino ($\\chi_2^0\\chi_1^\\pm$)\npair production at the LHC. The final state is characterized by 3 leptons and\nmissing energy. We probe the lepton flavour violating (LFV) vertex originating\nfrom $\\chi_2^0$ decay and identify a distinct and unambiguous combination of\nthe tri-lepton final state which include a lepton pair with same flavour and\nsame sign (SFSS) in addition to a pair with opposite flavour and opposite sign\n(OFOS). This combination of tri-lepton final state containing both OFOS and\nSFSS pairs, can not only suppress the SM background but can also differentiate\nthe flavour violating decays of $\\chi_2^0$ from its corresponding flavour\nconserving decays. We present results for various signal benchmark points\ntaking into account background contributions assuming two luminosity options\n(100 fb$^{-1}$ and 1000 fb$^{-1}$) for LHC Run 2 experiment.\n", "  Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by\nPlanck provide a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilation during the cosmic\ndark ages, and specifically constrain the annihilation parameter\n$f_\\mathrm{eff} \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle/m_\\chi$. Using new results (Paper II)\nfor the ionization produced by particles injected at arbitrary energies, we\ncalculate and provide $f_\\mathrm{eff}$ values for photons and $e^+e^-$ pairs\ninjected at keV-TeV energies; the $f_\\mathrm{eff}$ value for any dark matter\nmodel can be obtained straightforwardly by weighting these results by the\nspectrum of annihilation products. This result allows the sensitive and robust\nconstraints on dark matter annihilation presented by the Planck Collaboration\nto be applied to arbitrary dark matter models with $s$-wave annihilation. We\ndemonstrate the validity of this approach using principal component analysis.\nAs an example, we integrate over the spectrum of annihilation products for a\nrange of Standard Model final states to determine the CMB bounds on these\nmodels as a function of dark matter mass, and demonstrate that the new limits\ngenerically exclude models proposed to explain the observed high-energy rise in\nthe cosmic ray positron fraction. We make our results publicly available at\nhttp://nebel.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon.\n", "  Any injection of electromagnetically interacting particles during the cosmic\ndark ages will lead to increased ionization, heating, production of Lyman-alpha\nphotons and distortions to the energy spectrum of the cosmic microwave\nbackground, with potentially observable consequences. In this note we describe\nnumerical results for the low-energy electrons and photons produced by the\ncooling of particles injected at energies from keV to multi-TeV scales, at\narbitrary injection redshifts (but focusing on the post-recombination epoch).\nWe use these data, combined with existing calculations modeling the cooling of\nthese low-energy particles, to estimate the resulting contributions to\nionization, excitation and heating of the gas, and production of low-energy\nphotons below the threshold for excitation and ionization. We compute corrected\ndeposition-efficiency curves for annihilating dark matter, and demonstrate how\nto compute equivalent curves for arbitrary energy-injection histories. These\ncalculations provide the necessary inputs for the limits on dark matter\nannihilation presented in the accompanying Paper I, but also have potential\napplications in the context of dark matter decay or de-excitation, decay of\nother metastable species, or similar energy injections from new physics. We\nmake our full results publicly available at\nhttp://nebel.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon, to facilitate further independent\nstudies. In particular, we provide the full low-energy electron and photon\nspectra, to allow matching onto more detailed codes that describe the cooling\nof such particles at low energies.\n", "  We describe in this work the BASS survey for brown dwarfs in young moving\ngroups of the solar neighborhood, and summarize the results that it generated.\nThese include the discovery of the 2MASS J01033563-5515561 (AB)b and 2MASS\nJ02192210-3925225 B young companions near the deuterium-burning limit as well\nas 44 new low-mass stars and 69 new brown dwarfs with a spectroscopically\nconfirmed low gravity. Among those, ~20 have estimated masses within the\nplanetary regime, one is a new L4 $\\gamma$ bona fide member of AB Doradus,\nthree are TW Hydrae candidates with later spectral types (L1-L4) than all of\nits previously known members and six are among the first contenders to\nlow-gravity $\\geq$ L5 $\\beta$/$\\gamma$ brown dwarfs, reminiscent of WISEP\nJ004701.06+680352.1, PSO J318.5338-22.8603 and VHS J125601.92-125723.9 b.\nFinally, we describe a future version of this survey, BASS-Ultracool, that will\nspecifically target $\\geq$ L5 candidate members of young moving groups. First\nexperimentations in designing the survey have already led to the discovery of a\nnew T dwarf member of AB Doradus, as well as the serendipitous discoveries of\nan L9 subdwarf and an L5 + T5 brown dwarf binary.\n", "  Recently there have been several proposals of materials predicted to be\nnodal-ring semimetals, where zero energy excitations are characterized by a\nnodal ring in the momentum space. This class of materials falls between the\nDirac-like semimetals and the more conventional Fermi-surface systems. As a\nstep towards understanding this unconventional system, we explore the effects\nof the long-range Coulomb interaction. Due to the vanishing density of states\nat the Fermi level, Coulomb interaction is only partially screened and remains\nlong-ranged. Through renormalization group and large-$N_f$ computations, we\nhave identified a nontrivial interacting fixed point. The screened Coulomb\ninteraction at the interacting fixed point is an irrelevant perturbation,\nallowing controlled perturbative evaluations of physical properties of\nquasiparticles. We discuss unique experimental consequences of such\nquasiparticles: acoustic wave propagation, anisotropic dc conductivity, and\nrenormalized phonon dispersion as well as energy dependence of quasiparticle\nlifetime.\n", "  Based on a large number of observations carried out in the last decade it\nappears that the fraction of stars with protoplanetary disks declines steadily\nbetween ~1 Myr and ~10 Myr. We do, however, know that the multiplicity fraction\nof star-forming regions can be as high as >50% and that multiples have reduced\ndisk lifetimes on average. As a consequence, the observed roughly exponential\ndisk decay can be fully attributed neither to single nor binary stars and its\nfunctional form may need revision. Observational evidence for a non-exponential\ndecay has been provided by Kraus et al. (2012), who statistically correct\nprevious disk frequency measurements for the presence of binaries and find\nagreement with models that feature a constantly high disk fraction up to ~3\nMyr, followed by a rapid ($\\lesssim$2 Myr) decline. We present results from our\nhigh angular resolution observational program to study the fraction of\nprotoplanetary disks of single and binary stars separately. We find that disk\nevolution timescales of stars bound in close binaries (<100 AU) are\nsignificantly reduced compared to wider binaries. The frequencies of accretors\namong single stars and wide binaries appear indistinguishable, and are found to\nbe lower than predicted from planet forming disk models governed by viscous\nevolution and photoevaporation.\n", "  We present significant evidence of halo assembly bias for SDSS redMaPPer\ngalaxy clusters in the redshift range $[0.1, 0.33]$. By dividing the 8,648\nclusters into two subsamples based on the average member galaxy separation from\nthe cluster center, we first show that the two subsamples have very similar\nhalo mass of $M_{\\rm 200m}\\simeq 1.9\\times 10^{14}~h^{-1}M_\\odot$ based on the\nweak lensing signals at small radii $R<\\sim 10~h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$. However, their\nhalo bias inferred from both the large-scale weak lensing and the projected\nauto-correlation functions differs by a factor of $\\sim$1.5, which is a\nsignature of assembly bias. The same bias hypothesis for the two subsamples is\nexcluded at 2.5$\\sigma$ in the weak lensing and 4.4$\\sigma$ in the\nauto-correlation data, respectively. This result could bring a significant\nimpact on both galaxy evolution and precision cosmology.\n", "  With all the new discoveries being made about nearby young stars, the ability\nto find new nearby young stars is as important as ever, and membership\nidentification codes will continue to perform a vital role in scientific\nresearch. In the process of creating a new moving group membership\nidentification code - LocAting Constituent mEmbers In Nearby Groups (LACEwING)\n- we have discovered a few pointers relevant to astronomers trying to use codes\nlike LACEwING to locate young stars.\n", "  We study the effect of mode-coupling on a single-photon device in which a\ndipole-quantum-emitter (DQE) is embedded in a bimodal whispering-gallery-mode\ncavity (WGMC). A scatterer is used to induce mode coupling between\ncounter-clockwise and clockwise propagating light fields, which interact with\nthe DQE. In contrast to models for the interaction between a DQE and a\n(one-mode or two-mode) cavity field, we find that strong photon antibunching\ncan occur even for a weak DQE-field coupling and large dephasing of the DQE,\nwhen mode coupling is introduced. We also find that mode coupling can make the\ndevice robust against either the frequency mismatch between cavity modes and\nthe DQE or the coupling strength mismatch between the DQE and each mode in the\ntwo-mode cavity. Moreover, we find that these mismatches can be used to\ngenerate better antibunching in the weak DQE-field coupling regime. Our study\nshows that mode coupling in a bimodal cavity is very important for the\nrealization of a good single-photon device.\n", "  Under the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), quantum-quenched\nsystems equilibrate towards canonical, thermal ensembles. While at first glance\nthe ETH might seem a very strong hypothesis, we show that it is indeed not only\nsufficient but also necessary for thermalization. More specifically, we\nconsider systems coupled to baths with well-defined macroscopic temperature and\nshow that whenever all product states thermalize then the ETH must hold. Our\nresult definitively settles the question of determining whether a quantum\nsystem has a thermal behaviour, reducing it to checking whether its Hamiltonian\nsatisfies the ETH.\n", "  We investigate the thermalization process of the Universe after inflation to\ndetermine the evolution of the effective temperature. The time scale of\nthermalization is found to be so long that it delays the evolution of the\neffective temperature, and the resulting maximal temperature of the Universe\ncan be significantly lower than the one obtained in the literature. Our results\nclarify the finite density corrections to the effective potential of a scalar\nfield and also processes of heavy particle production. In particular, we find\nthat the maximum temperature of the Universe may be at most electroweak scale\nif the reheating temperature is as low as ${\\cal O} (1)$ MeV, which implies\nthat the electroweak symmetry may be marginally restored. In addition, it is\nnoticeable that the dark matter may not be produced from thermal plasma in such\na low reheating scenario, since the maximum temperature can be smaller than the\nconventional estimation by five orders of magnitude. We also give implications\nto the Peccei-Quinn mechanism and the Affleck-Dine baryogenesis.\n", "  We show that observation of the time-dependent effect of microlensing of\nrelativistically broadened emission lines (such as e.g. the Fe Kalpha line in\nX-rays) in strongly lensed quasars could provide data on celestial mechanics of\ncircular orbits in the direct vicinity of the horizon of supermassive black\nholes. This information can be extracted from the observation of evolution of\nred / blue edge of the magnified line just before and just after the period of\ncrossing of the innermost stable circular orbit by the microlensing caustic.\nThe functional form of this evolution is insensitive to numerous astrophysical\nparameters of the accreting black hole and of the microlensing caustics network\nsystem (as opposed to the evolution the full line spectrum). Measurement of the\ntemporal evolution of the red / blue edge could provide a precision measurement\nof the radial dependence of the gravitational redshift and of velocity of the\ncircular orbits, down to the innermost stable circular orbit. These\nmeasurements could be used to discriminate between the General Relativity and\nalternative models of the relativistic gravity in which the dynamics of photons\nand massive bodies orbiting the gravitating centre is different from that of\nthe geodesics in the Schwarzschild or Kerr space-times.\n", "  We combined the spectroscopic information from the 3D-HST survey with\n\\textit{Herschel} data to characterize the H$\\alpha$ dust attenuation\nproperties of a sample of 79 main sequence star-forming galaxies at $z \\sim 1$\nin the GOODS-S field. The sample was selected in the far-IR, at $\\lambda$=100\nand/or 160 $\\mu$m, and only includes galaxies with a secure H$\\alpha$ detection\n(S/N$>$3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured the redshifts and\nthe H$\\alpha$ fluxes for the whole sample (a factor of 1/1.2 was applied to the\nobserved fluxes to remove the [NII] contamination). The stellar masses\n(M$_{\\star}$), infrared (L$_{IR}$) and UV luminosities (L$_{UV}$) were derived\nfrom the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE 500\n$\\mu$m. We estimated the continuum extinction E$_{star}$(B-V) from both the\nIRX=L$_{IR}$/L$_{UV}$ ratio and the UV-slope, $\\beta$, and found an excellent\nagreement between the two. The nebular extinction was estimated from comparison\nof the observed SFR$_{H\\alpha}$ and SFR$_{UV}$. We obtained\n\\emph{f}=E$_{star}$(B-V)/E$_{neb}$(B-V)=0.93$\\pm$0.06, i.e. higher than the\ncanonical value of \\emph{f}=0.44 measured in the local Universe. Our derived\ndust correction produces good agreement between the H$\\alpha$ and IR+UV SFRs\nfor galaxies with SFR$\\gtrsim$ 20 M$_{\\odot}$/yr and M$_{\\star} \\gtrsim 5\n\\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$, while objects with lower SFR and M$_{\\star}$ seem\nto require a smaller \\emph{f}-factor (i.e. higher H$\\alpha$ extinction\ncorrection). Our results then imply that the nebular extinction for our sample\nis comparable to that in the optical-UV continuum and suggest that the\n\\emph{f}-factor is a function of both M$_{\\star}$ and SFR, in agreement with\nprevious studies.\n", "  We consider the electromagnetic field generated by a coherent conductor in\nwhich electron transport is described quantum mechanically. We obtain an\ninput-output relation linking the quantum current in the conductor to the\nmeasured electromagnetic field. This allows us to compute the outcome of\nmeasurements on the field in terms of the statistical properties of the\ncurrent. We moreover show how under ac-bias the conductor acts as a tunable\nmedium for the field, allowing for the generation of single- and two-mode\nsqueezing through fermionic reservoir engineering. These results explain the\nrecently observed squeezing using normal tunnel junctions [G. Gasse et al.,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 111 136601 (2013); J.-C. Forgues et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114\n130403 (2015)].\n", "  We follow the time evolution of a superfluid Fermi gas of resonantly\ninteracting $^6$Li atoms after a phase imprint. Via tomographic imaging, we\nobserve the formation of a planar dark soliton, its subsequent snaking, and its\ndecay into a vortex ring, which in turn breaks to finally leave behind a single\nsolitonic vortex. In intermediate stages we find evidence for an exotic\nstructure resembling the $\\Phi$-soliton, a combination of a vortex ring and a\nvortex line. Direct imaging of the nodal surface reveals its undulation\ndynamics and its decay via the puncture of the initial soliton plane. The\nobserved evolution of the nodal surface represents dynamics beyond superfluid\nhydrodynamics, calling for a microscopic description of unitary fermionic\nsuperfluids out of equilibrium.\n", "  We have investigated the valley degeneracy of MoS2 multilayers and its effect\non thermoelectric properties. By modulating the layer thickness and external\nelectric field, the hole valleys at {\\Gamma} and K points in the highest energy\nvalence band and the electron valleys at K and {\\Sigma}min points in the lowest\nenergy conduction band are shifted differently. The hole valley degeneracy is\nobserved in MoS2 monolayer, while that of electron valley is in MoS2 bilayer\nand monolayer under the external electric field. By tuning the valley\ndegeneracy, the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity can be\nseparately controlled, and the maximum power factor can be obtained in n-type\n(p-type) MoS2 monolayer with (without) the external electric field. We suggest\nthat the transition metal dichalcogenides are good example to investigate the\nrole of valley degeneracy in the thermoelectric and optical properties with the\ncontrol of interlayer interaction and external electric field strength.\n", "  We reconsider the Rovelli-Smolin model of gravity coupled to the Klein-Gordon\ntime field with an eye towards capturing the degrees of freedom of the scalar\nfield lost in the framework in which time is deparametrized by the scalar\nfield. Several new results for loop quantum gravity are obtained:\n  (i) a Hilbert space for the gravity-matter system and a non-standard\nrepresentation of the scalar field thereon is constructed, (ii) a new operator\nfor the scalar constraint of the coupled system is defined and investigated,\n(iii) methods for solving the constraint are developed.\n  Commutators of the new constraint do not vanish, but seem to reproduce a part\nof the Dirac algebra. This, however, poses problems for finding solutions.\nHence the states we consider -- and perhaps the whole setup -- still needs some\nimprovement.\n  As a side result we describe a representation of the gravitational degrees of\nfreedom in which the flux is diagonal. This representation bears a strong\nresemblance to the BF vacuum of Dittrich and Geiller.\n", "  We investigate even-even two-proton borromean systems at prominent\nintermediate heavy waiting points for the rapid proton capture process. The\nmost likely single-particle levels are used to calculate three-body energy and\nstructure as a function of proton-core resonance energy. We establish a linear\ndependence between two- and three-body energies with the same slope, but the\nabsolute value slightly dependent on partial wave structure. Using these\nrelations we predict low-lying excited states in the isotones following the\ncritical waiting points. The capture rate for producing a borromean bound state\nis described both based on a full three-body calculation and on a very simple\nanalytic rate expression for temperatures about $1-5$~GK. This rate is valid\nfor both direct and sequential capture paths, and it only depends on the\nthree-body resonance energy. As a result the relevant path of the radiative\ncapture reactions can be determined. We present numerical results for $E1$ and\n$E2$ photon emission, and discuss occurrence preferences in general as well as\nrelative sizes of these most likely processes. Finally, we present narrow\nestimated intervals for the proton capture rates relevant for the critical\nwaiting points.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the abundance of carbon dioxide in\nexoplanetary atmospheres in hot, hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We construct\nnovel analytical models of systems in chemical equilibrium that include carbon\nmonoxide, carbon dioxide, water, methane and acetylene and relate the\nequilibrium constants of the chemical reactions to temperature and pressure via\nthe tabulated Gibbs free energies. We prove that such chemical systems may be\ndescribed by a quintic equation for the mixing ratio of methane. By examining\nthe abundances of these molecules across a broad range of temperatures\n(spanning equilibrium temperatures from 600 to 2500 K), pressures (via\ntemperature-pressure profiles that explore albedo and opacity variations) and\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratios, we conclude that carbon dioxide is subdominant\ncompared to carbon monoxide and water. Atmospheric mixing does not alter this\nconclusion if carbon dioxide is subdominant everywhere in the atmosphere.\nCarbon dioxide and carbon monoxide may attain comparable abundances if the\nmetallicity is greatly enhanced, but this property is negated by temperatures\nabove 1000 K. For hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, our generic result has the\nimplication that retrieval studies may wish to set the subdominance of carbon\ndioxide as a prior of the calculation and not let its abundance completely roam\nfree as a fitting parameter, because it directly affects the inferred value of\nthe carbon-to-oxygen ratio and may produce unphysical conclusions. We discuss\nthe relevance of these implications for the hot Jupiter WASP-12b and suggest\nthat some of the previous results are chemically impossible. The relative\nabundance of carbon dioxide to acetylene is potentially a sensitive diagnostic\nof the carbon-to-oxygen ratio.\n", "  In this paper, I argue that light is a continuous classical electromagnetic\nwave, while the observed so-called quantum nature of the interaction of light\nwith matter is connected to the discrete (atomic) structure of matter and to\nthe specific nature of the light-atom interaction. From this point of view, the\nBorn rule for light is derived, and the double-slit experiment is analysed in\ndetail. I show that the double-slit experiment can be explained without using\nthe concept of a \"photon\", solely on the basis of classical electrodynamics. I\nshow that within this framework, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for a\n\"photon\" has a simple physical meaning not related to the fundamental\nlimitations in accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of position and\nmomentum or time and energy. I argue also that we can avoid the paradoxes\nconnected with the wave-particle duality of the electron if we consider some\nclassical wave field - an \"electron wave\" - instead of electrons as the\nparticles and consider the wave equations (Dirac, Klein-Gordon, Pauli and\nSchrodinger) as the field equations similar to Maxwell equations for the\nelectromagnetic field. It is shown that such an electron field must have an\nelectric charge, an intrinsic angular momentum and an intrinsic magnetic moment\ncontinuously distributed in the space. It is shown that from this perspective,\nthe double-slit experiment for \"electrons\", the Born rule, the Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle and the Compton effect all have a simple explanation\nwithin classical field theory. The proposed perspective allows consideration of\nquantum mechanics not as a theory of particles but as a classical field theory\nsimilar to Maxwell electrodynamics.\n", "  We investigated the spatial distribution of quantum fluctuations in a\nsqueezed vacuum field, generated via polarization self-rotation (PSR)\ninteraction of an ensemble of Rb atoms and a strong near-resonant linearly\npolarized laser field. We found that the noise suppression is greatly effected\nby the transverse profile of a spatial mask, placed in both the squeezed field\nand the local oscillator, as well as its position along the focused beam near\nthe focal point. These observations indicate the spatial multi-mode structure\nof the squeezed vacuum field. We have developed a theoretical model that\ndescribes the generation of higher-order Laguerre-Gauss modes as a result of\nPSR light-atom interaction. The prediction of this model are in a good\nqualitative agreement with the experimental measurements.\n", "  Students in introductory physics struggle with vector algebra and these\nchallenges are often associated with contextual and representational features\nof the problems. Performance on problems about cross product direction is\nparticularly poor and some research suggests that this may be primarily due to\nmisapplied right-hand rules. However, few studies have had the resolution to\nexplore student use of right-hand rules in detail. This study reviews\nliterature in several disciplines, including spatial cognition, to identify ten\ncontextual and representational problem features that are most likely to\ninfluence performance on problems requiring a right-hand rule. Two quantitative\nmeasures of performance (correctness and response time) and two qualitative\nmeasures (methods used and type of errors made) were used to explore the impact\nof these problem features on student performance. Quantitative results are\nconsistent with expectations from the literature, but reveal that some features\n(such as the type of reasoning required and the physical awkwardness of using a\nright-hand rule) have a greater impact than others (such as whether the vectors\nare placed together or separate). Additional insight is gained by the\nqualitative analysis, including identifying sources of difficulty not\npreviously discussed in the literature and revealing that the use of\nsupplemental methods, such as physically rotating the paper, can mitigate\nerrors associated with certain features.\n", "  The ferrimagnetic spinel $\\mathrm{CoV_2O_4}$ has been a topic of intense\nrecent interest, both as a frustrated insulator with unquenched orbital\ndegeneracy and as a near-itinerant magnet which can be driven metallic with\nmoderate applied pressure. Here, we report on our recent neutron diffraction\nand inelastic scattering measurements on powders with minimal cation site\ndisorder. Our main new result is the identification of a weak ($\\frac{\\Delta\na}{a} \\sim 10^{-4}$), first order structural phase transition at $T^*$ = 90 K,\nthe same temperature where spin canting was seen in recent single crystal\nmeasurements. This transition is characterized by a short-range distortion of\noxygen octahedral positions, and inelastic data further establish a weak\n$\\Delta\\sim 1.25 meV$ spin gap at low temperature. Together, these findings\nprovide strong support for the local orbital picture and the existence of an\norbital glass state at temperatures below $T^*$.\n", "  Topological vortex formation has been known as the simplest method for vortex\nformation in BEC of alkali atoms. This scheme requires inversion of the bias\nmagnetic field along the axis of the condensate, which leads to atom loss when\nthe bias field crosses zero. In this Letter, we propose a scheme with which the\natom loss is greatly suppressed by adding counter-diabatic magnetic field. A\nnaive counter-diabatic field violates the Maxwell equations and we need to\nintroduce an approximation to make it physically feasible. The resulting field\nrequires an extra currents, which is experimentally challenging. Finally we\nsolve this problem by applying a gauge transformation so that the\ncounter-diabatic field is generated by controlling the original trap field with\nthe additional control of the bias field.\n", "  We use a large sample of isolated dark matter halo pairs drawn from\ncosmological N-body simulations to identify candidate systems whose kinematics\nmatch that of the Local Group of Galaxies (LG). We find, in agreement with the\n\"timing argument\" and earlier work, that the separation and approach velocity\nof the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies favour a total mass for the\npair of ~ 5*10^12 M_sun. A mass this large, however, is difficult to reconcile\nwith the small relative tangential velocity of the pair, as well as with the\nsmall deceleration from the Hubble flow observed for the most distant LG\nmembers. Halo pairs that match these three criteria have average masses a\nfactor of ~2 times smaller than suggested by the timing argument, but with\nlarge dispersion, spanning more than a decade in mass. Guided by these results,\nwe have selected 12 halo pairs with total mass in the range 1.6-3.6 *10^12\nM_sun for the APOSTLE project (A Project Of Simulations of The Local\nEnvironment), a suite of resimulations at various numerical resolution levels\n(reaching up to ~10^4 M_sun per gas particle) that use the hydrodynamical code\nand subgrid physics developed for the EAGLE project. These simulations\nreproduce, by construction, the main kinematics of the MW-M31 pair, and produce\nsatellite populations whose overall number, luminosities, and kinematics are in\ngood agreement with observations of the MW and M31 companions. These\ndiagnostics are sensitive to the total mass assumed for the MW-M31 pair;\nindeed, the LG satellite population would be quite difficult to reproduce for\npair masses as high as indicated by the timing argument. The APOSTLE candidate\nsystems thus provide an excellent testbed to confront directly many of the\npredictions of the Lambda-CDM cosmology with observations of our local\nUniverse.\n", "  Einstein-Smoluchowski diffusion, damped harmonic oscillations, and spatial\ndecoherence are special cases of an elegant class of Markovian quantum Brownian\nmotion models that is invariant under linear symplectic transformations. Here\nwe prove that for each member of this class there is a preferred timescale such\nthat the dynamics, considered stroboscopically, can be rewritten exactly as\nunitary evolution interrupted periodically by an entanglement-breaking\nmeasurement with respect to a fixed overcomplete set of pure Gaussian states.\nThis is relevant to the continuing search for the best way to describe pointer\nstates and pure decoherence in systems with continuous variables, and gives a\nconcrete sense in which the decoherence can be said to arise from a complete\nmeasurement of the system by its environment. We also extend some of the\nresults of Di\\'{o}si and Kiefer to the symplectic covariant formalism and\ncompare them with the preferred timescales and Gaussian states associated with\nthe POVM form.\n", "  Galactic archaeology is the study of the history of star formation and\nchemical evolution in the Milky Way, based on present-day stellar populations.\nStudies of young stars are a key anchor point for Galactic archaeology, since\nquantities like the initial mass function and the star formation rate can be\nstudied directly in young clusters and star forming regions. Conversely,\nmassive spectroscopic Galactic archaeology surveys can be used as a data source\nfor young star studies.\n", "  We report the discovery of the eighth and ninth known Trojans in stable\norbits around Neptune's leading Lagrange point, L4. The objects 2014 QO$_{441}$\nand 2014 QP$_{441}$ were detected in data obtained during the 2013-14 and\n2014-15 observing seasons by the Dark Energy Survey, using the Dark Energy\nCamera (DECam) on the 4-meter Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American\nObservatory. Both are in high-inclination orbits (18.8$^{\\circ}$ and\n19.4$^{\\circ}$ respectively). With an eccentricity of 0.104, 2014 QO$_{441}$\nhas the most eccentric orbit of the eleven known stable Neptune Trojans. Here\nwe describe the search procedure and investigate the objects' long-term\ndynamical stability and physical properties.\n", "  The motivation for this study is to include the effect of plasma flow in\nAlfv\\'en wave (AW) damping via phase mixing and to explore the observational\nimplications. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and analytical\ncalculations show that, when a background flow is present, mathematical\nexpressions for the AW damping via phase mixing are modified by the following\nsubstitution: $C_A^\\prime(x) \\to C_A^\\prime(x)+V_0^\\prime(x)$, where $C_A$ and\n$V_0$ are AW phase and the flow speeds, and the prime denotes a derivative in\nthe direction across the background magnetic field. In uniform magnetic fields\nand over-dense plasma structures, where $C_A$ is smaller than in the\nsurrounding plasma, the flow, which is confined to the structure and going in\nthe same direction as the AW, reduces the effect of phase-mixing, because on\nthe edges of the structure $C_A^\\prime$ and $V_0^\\prime$ have opposite signs.\nThus, the wave damps by means of slower phase-mixing compared to the case\nwithout the flow. This is the result of the co-directional flow that reduces\nthe wave front stretching in the transverse direction. We apply our findings to\naddressing the question why over-dense solar coronal open magnetic field\nstructures (OMFS) are cooler than the background plasma. Observations show that\nthe over-dense OMFS (e.g. solar coronal polar plumes) are cooler than\nsurrounding plasma and that, in these structures, Doppler line-broadening is\nconsistent with bulk plasma motions, such as AW. If over-dense solar coronal\nOMFS are heated by AW damping via phase-mixing, we show that, co-directional\nwith AW, plasma flow in them reduces the phase-mixing induced-heating, thus\nproviding an explanation of why they appear cooler than the background.\n", "  We investigate dyonic black hole and dyon solutions of four-dimensional\n$SU(N)$ Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant. We\nderive a set of field equations in this case, and prove the existence of\nnon-trivial solutions to these equations for any integer $N$, with $2N-2$ gauge\ndegrees of freedom. We do this by showing that solutions exist locally at\ninfinity, and at the event horizon for black holes and the origin for solitons.\nWe then prove that we can patch these solutions together regularly into global\nsolutions that can be integrated arbitrarily far into the asymptotic regime.\nOur main result is to show that dyonic solutions exist in open sets in the\nparameter space, and hence that we can find non-trivial dyonic solutions in a\nnumber of regimes whose magnetic gauge fields have no zeroes, which is likely\nimportant to the stability of the solutions.\n", "  Chiral effective field theory (EFT) enables a systematic description of\nlow-energy hadronic interactions with controlled theoretical uncertainties. For\nstrongly interacting systems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods provide some of\nthe most accurate solutions, but they require as input local potentials. We\nhave recently constructed local chiral nucleon-nucleon (NN) interactions up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO). Chiral EFT naturally predicts\nconsistent many-body forces. In this paper, we consider the leading chiral\nthree-nucleon (3N) interactions in local form. These are included in auxiliary\nfield diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC) simulations. We present results for the\nequation of state of neutron matter and for the energies and radii of neutron\ndrops. In particular, we study the regulator dependence at the Hartree-Fock\nlevel and in AFDMC and find that present local regulators lead to less\nrepulsion from 3N forces compared to the usual nonlocal regulators.\n", "  In this paper, we consider an equation on random variables which can be\nreduced to the equation which describes the evolution of systems of fermions.\nWe give some results of well-posedness for this equation on the spheres and\ntorus of dimension 2 and 3 and on the Euclidean space. We give results of\nscattering and blow-up on the Euclidean depending on if the equation is\ndefocusing or focusing. We interpret the results in terms of the evolution of\nfermions.\n", "  Stellar evolution models are a cornerstone of young star astrophysics, which\nnecessitates that they yield accurate and reliable predictions of stellar\nproperties. Here, I review the current performance of stellar evolution models\nagainst young astrophysical benchmarks and highlight recent progress\nincorporating non-standard physics, such as magnetic field and starspots, to\nexplain observed deficiencies. While addition of these physical processes leads\nto improved agreement between models and observations, there are several\nfundamental limitations in our understanding about how these physical processes\noperate. These limitations inhibit our ability to form a coherent picture of\nthe essential physics needed to accurately compute young stellar models, but\nprovide rich avenues for further exploration.\n", "  The nearest, youngest groups of stars to the Sun provide important samples of\nage-dated stars for studying circumstellar disk evolution, imaged exoplanets,\nand brown dwarfs. I briefly comment on the status of the known stellar groups\nwithin 100 pc: $\\beta$ Pic, AB Dor, UMa, Car-Near, Tuc-Hor and $\\beta$ Tuc\nnucleus, Hyades, Col, TW Hya, Car, Coma Ber, 32 Ori, $\\eta$ Cha, and $\\chi^1$\nFor. I also discuss some poorly characterized groups and \"non-groups.\" Grades\nfor 2015 of Pass, Satisfactory, or Fail are assigned to the groups for the\npurposes of age-dating stars and brown dwarfs. I speculate that Tuc-Hor could\nhave provided a supernova ~60 pc away ~2.2 Myr ago which showered the Earth\nwith traces of 60Fe-bearing dust.\n", "  We propose a framework within which a robust mechanical definition of\nprecursors to plastic instabilities, often termed `soft-spots', naturally\nemerges. They are shown to be collective displacements (modes) $\\hat{z}_0$ that\ncorrespond to local minima of the `barrier function' $b(\\hat{z})$. The latter\nis derived from the cubic approximation of the variation $\\delta\nU_{\\hat{z}}(s)$ of the potential energy upon displacing particles a distance\n$s$ along $\\hat{z}$. We show that modes $\\hat{z}_0$ corresponding to low-lying\nminima of $b(\\hat{z})$ lead to transitions over energy barriers in the glass,\nand are therefore associated with highly asymmetric variations $\\delta\nU_{\\hat{z}}(s)$ with $s$. We further demonstrate how a heuristic search for\nlocal minima of $b(\\hat{z})$ can a-priori detect the locus and geometry of\nimminent plastic instabilities with remarkable accuracy, at strains as large as\n$\\gamma_c-\\gamma \\sim 10^{-2}$ away from the instability strain $\\gamma_c$,\nwhere the non-affine displacements under shear are still largely delocalized.\nOur findings suggest that the a-priori detection of plastic instabilities can\nbe effectively carried out by the investigation of the landscape of\n$b(\\hat{z})$.\n", "  In two-dimensional systems with a continuous symmetry the\nMermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem precludes spontaneous symmetry breaking and\ncondensation at finite temperature. The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ncritical temperature marks the transition from a superfluid phase characterized\nby quasi-condensation and algebraic long-range order to a normal phase, where\nvortex proliferation completely destroys superfluidity. As opposed to\nconventional off-diagonal long-range order typical of three-dimensional\nsuperfluid systems, algebraic long-range order is driven by quantum and thermal\nfluctuations strongly enhanced in reduced dimensionality. Motivated by this\nunique scenario and by the very recent experimental realization of trapped\nquasi-two-dimensional fermionic clouds, we include one-loop Gaussian\nfluctuations in the theoretical description of resonant Fermi superfluids in\ntwo dimensions demonstrating that first sound, second sound and also critical\ntemperature are strongly renormalized, away from their mean-field values. In\nparticular, we prove that in the intermediate and strong coupling regimes these\nquantities are radically different when Gaussian fluctuations are taken into\naccount. Our one-loop theory shows good agreement with very recent experimental\ndata on the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperature [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 115, 010401 (2015)] and on the first sound velocity, giving novel\npredictions for the second sound as a function of interaction strength and\ntemperature, open for experimental verification.\n", "  Extensive research into high temperature superconducting cuprates is now\nfocused upon identifying the relationship between the classic 'pseudogap'\nphenomenon$^{1,2}$ and the more recently investigated density wave\nstate$^{3-13}$. This state always exhibits wave vector $Q$ parallel to the\nplanar Cu-O-Cu bonds$^{4-13}$ along with a predominantly $d$-symmetry form\nfactor$^{14-17}$ (dFF-DW). Finding its microscopic mechanism has now become a\nkey objective$^{18-30}$ of this field. To accomplish this, one must identify\nthe momentum-space ($k$-space) states contributing to the dFF-DW spectral\nweight, determine their particle-hole phase relationship about the Fermi\nenergy, establish whether they exhibit a characteristic energy gap, and\nunderstand the evolution of all these phenomena throughout the phase diagram.\nHere we use energy-resolved sublattice visualization$^{14}$ of electronic\nstructure and show that the characteristic energy of the dFF-DW modulations is\nactually the 'pseudogap' energy $\\Delta_{1}$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the\ndFF-DW modulations at $E=-\\Delta_{1}$ (filled states) occur with relative phase\n$\\pi$ compared to those at $E=\\Delta_{1}$ (empty states). Finally, we show that\nthe dFF-DW $Q$ corresponds directly to scattering between the 'hot frontier'\nregions of $k$-space beyond which Bogoliubov quasiparticles cease to\nexist$^{31,32,33}$. These data demonstrate that the dFF-DW state is consistent\nwith particle-hole interactions focused at the pseudogap energy scale and\nbetween the four pairs of 'hot frontier' regions in $k$-space where the\npseudogap opens.\n", "  We present a bird's-eye survey on the development of fundamental ideas of\nquantum gravity, placing emphasis on perturbative approaches, string theory,\nloop quantum gravity, and black hole thermodynamics. The early ideas at the\ndawn of quantum gravity as well as the possible observations of quantum\ngravitational effects in the foreseeable future are also briefly discussed.\n", "  We present here the first convincing observational manifestation of a\nmagnetar-like magnetic field in an accreting neutron star in binary system -\nthe first pulsating ultra-luminous X-ray source X-2 in the galaxy M82. Using\nthe Chandra X-ray observatory data we show that the source exhibit the bimodal\ndistribution of the luminosity with two well-defined peaks separated by a\nfactor of 40. This behaviour can be interpreted as the action of the \"propeller\nregime\" of accretion. The onset of the propeller in a 1.37 s pulsar at\nluminosity of ~$10^{40}$ erg/s implies the dipole component of the neutron star\nmagnetic field of ~$10^{14}$ G.\n", "  Cosmic microwave background lensing has become a new cosmological probe,\ncarrying rich information on the matter power spectrum and distances over the\nredshift range $z\\approx1$-4. We investigate the role of scale dependent new\nphysics, such as from modified gravity, neutrino mass, and cold (low sound\nspeed) dark energy, and its signature on CMB lensing. The distinction between\ndifferent scale dependences, and the different redshift dependent weighting of\nthe matter power spectrum entering into CMB lensing and other power spectra,\nimply that CMB lensing can probe simultaneously a diverse range of physics. We\nhighlight the role of arcminute resolution polarization experiments for\ndistinguishing between physical effects.\n", "  We report on measurements of the decays of $\\overline{B}$ mesons into the\nsemileptonic final states $\\overline{B} \\to D^{(*)} \\pi^+\\pi^-\n\\ell^-\\overline{\\nu}$, where $D^{(*)}$ represents a $D$ or $D^*$ meson and\n$\\ell^-$ is an electron or a muon. These measurements are based on $471\\times\n10^6$ $B\\overline{B}$ pairs recorded with the $BABAR$ detector at the SLAC\nasymmetric $B$ Factory PEP-II. We determine the branching fraction ratios\n$R^{(*)}_{\\pi^+\\pi^-} = \\mathcal{B}(\\overline{B} \\to D^{(*)} \\pi^+\\pi^- \\ell^-\n\\overline{\\nu})/\\mathcal{B}(\\overline{B} \\to D^{(*)} \\ell^-\\overline{\\nu})$\nusing events in which the second $B$ meson is fully reconstructed. We find\n$R_{\\pi^+\\pi^-} = 0.067 \\pm 0.010 \\pm 0.008$ and $R^*_{\\pi^+\\pi^-} = 0.019 \\pm\n0.005 \\pm 0.004$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is\nsystematic. Based on these results, we estimate that $\\overline{B} \\to\nD^{(*)}\\pi\\pi\\ell^-\\overline{\\nu}$ decays, where $\\pi$ denotes both a $\\pi^\\pm$\nand $\\pi^0$ meson, account for up to half the difference between the measured\ninclusive semileptonic branching fraction to charm hadrons and the\ncorresponding sum of previously measured exclusive branching fractions.\n", "  We present a Bayesian reconstruction method which maps a galaxy distribution\nfrom redshift-space to real-space inferring the distances of the individual\ngalaxies. The method is based on sampling density fields assuming a lognormal\nprior with a likelihood given by the negative binomial distribution function\nmodelling stochastic bias. We assume a deterministic bias given by a power law\nrelating the dark matter density field to the expected halo or galaxy field.\nCoherent redshift-space distortions are corrected in a Gibbs-sampling procedure\nby moving the galaxies from redshift-space to real-space according to the\npeculiar motions derived from the recovered density field using linear theory\nwith the option to include tidal field corrections from second order Lagrangian\nperturbation theory. The virialised distortions are corrected by sampling\ncandidate real-space positions (being in the neighbourhood of the observations\nalong the line of sight), which are compatible with the bulk flow corrected\nredshift-space position adding a random dispersion term in high density\ncollapsed regions. The latter are defined according to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian. This approach presents an alternative method to estimate the distances\nto galaxies using the three dimensional spatial information, and assuming\nisotropy. Hence the number of applications is very broad. In this work we show\nthe potential of this method to constrain the growth rate up to $k$ ~ 0.3 $h$\nMpc$^{-1}$. Furthermore it could be useful to correct for photo-metric redshift\nerrors, and to obtain improved BAO reconstructions.\n", "  We present infrared multi-epoch observations of the dust forming nova V1280\nSco over $\\sim$2000 days from the outburst. The temporal evolution of the\ninfrared spectral energy distributions at 1272, 1616 and 1947 days can be\nexplained by the emissions produced by amorphous carbon dust of mass\n(6.6--8.7)$\\times$10$^{-8}$M$_{\\odot}$ with a representative grain size of\n0.01$~\\mu$m and astronomical silicate dust of mass\n(3.4--4.3)$\\times$10$^{-7}$M$_{\\odot}$ with a representative grain size of\n0.3--0.5$~\\mu$m. Both of these dust species travel farther away from the white\ndwarf without an apparent mass evolution throughout those later epochs. The\ndust formation scenario around V1280 Sco suggested from our analyses is that\nthe amorphous carbon dust is formed in the nova ejecta followed by the\nformation of silicate dust in the expanding nova ejecta or as a result of the\ninteraction between the nova wind and the circumstellar medium.\n", "  We report on Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) hard X-ray\nobservations of the young rotation-powered radio pulsar PSR B1509$-$58 in the\nsupernova remnant MSH 15$-$52. We confirm the previously reported curvature in\nthe hard X-ray spectrum, showing that a log parabolic model provides a\nstatistically superior fit to the spectrum compared with the standard power\nlaw. The log parabolic model describes the NuSTAR data, as well as previously\npublished gamma-ray data obtained with COMPTEL and AGILE, all together spanning\n3 keV through 500 MeV. Our spectral modelling allows us to constrain the peak\nof the broadband high energy spectrum to be at 2.6$\\pm$0.8 MeV, an improvement\nof nearly an order of magnitude in precision over previous measurements. In\naddition, we calculate NuSTAR spectra in 26 pulse phase bins and confirm\npreviously reported variations of photon indices with phase. Finally, we\nmeasure the pulsed fraction of PSR B1509$-$58 in the hard X-ray energy band for\nthe first time. Using the energy resolved pulsed fraction results, we estimate\nthat the pulsar's off-pulse emission has a photon index value between 1.26 and\n1.96. Our results support a model in which the pulsar's lack of GeV emission is\ndue to viewing geometry, with the X-rays originating from synchrotron emission\nfrom secondary pairs in the magnetosphere.\n", "  We continue our study of Horava-Lifshitz type theories using the methods of\nthe spectral geometry. In this work we construct the infrared action of gravity\nand matter coupled to gravity in the most general way respecting the foliation\npreserving diffeomorphisms. This is done with the help of the spectral action\nprinciple based on some generalized Dirac operator. The gravity part reproduces\nthe infrared limit of the Horava-Lifshitz gravity, while the matter part gives\nthe generalization of the earlier suggested models. Due to the fact that the\nsame Dirac operator is used in the construction of both sectors, the parameters\nof the gravity and matter parts are related. We expect that this potentially\ncould naturally exclude fine tunings needed to get some desired properties as\nwell as open new possibilities for the experimental tests of the model.\n", "  A diboson excess has been observed ---albeit with very limited statistical\nsignificance--- in $WW$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$ final states at the LHC experiments\nusing the accumulated 8 TeV data. Assuming that these signals are due to\nresonances resulting from an extended symmetry breaking sector in the standard\nmodel and exact custodial symmetry we determine using unitarization methods the\nvalues of the relevant low-energy constants in the corresponding effective\nLagrangian. Unitarity arguments also predict the widths of these resonances. We\nintroduce unitarized form factors to allow for a proper treatment of the\nresonances in Monte Carlo generators and a more precise comparison with\nexperiment.\n", "  We consider photoproduction of $\\omega$ mesons off complex nuclei to study\ninteractions of transversely and longitudinally polarized vector mesons with\nnucleons. Whereas the total cross section for interactions of the transversely\npolarized vector mesons with nucleons $\\sigma_T=\\sigma(V_TN)$ can be obtained\nfrom coherent photoproduction, measurements of vector meson photoproduction in\nthe incoherent region provide a unique opportunity to extract the total cross\nsection for longitudinally polarized mesons interacting with nucleons\n$\\sigma_L=\\sigma(V_LN)$, which has not yet been measured and strongly depends\non theoretical approaches. This work is stimulated by the construction of the\nnew experiment GlueX at Jefferson Lab, designed to study the photoproduction of\nmesons in a large beam energy range up to 12 GeV.\n", "  We study the canonical realization of BMS symmetry for a massive scalar field\nintroduced in reference \\cite{LM}. We will construct an invariant scalar\nproduct for the generalized momenta. As a consequence we will introduce a\nquadratic Casimir with the supertranslations.\n", "  We present initial results of a new campaign of simulations focusing on the\ninteraction of planetary winds with stellar environments using Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement methods. We have confirmed the results of Stone & Proga 2009 that an\nazimuthal flow structure is created in the planetary wind due to day/night\ntemperatures differences. We show that a backflow towards the planet will occur\nwith a strength that depends on the escape parameter. When a stellar outflow is\nincluded, we see unstable bow waves forming through the outflow's interaction\nwith the planetary wind.\n", "  We present a self-consistent, absolute isochronal age scale for young (< 200\nMyr), nearby (< 100 pc) moving groups, which is consistent with recent lithium\ndepletion boundary ages for both the Beta Pic and Tucana-Horologium moving\ngroups. This age scale was derived using a set of semi-empirical\npre-main-sequence model isochrones that incorporate an empirical colour-Teff\nrelation and bolometric corrections based on the observed colours of Pleiades\nmembers, with theoretical corrections for the dependence on log g. Absolute\nages for young, nearby groups are vital as these regions play a crucial role in\nour understanding of the early evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars,\nas well as providing ideal targets for direct imaging and other measurements of\ndusty debris discs, substellar objects and, of course, extrasolar planets.\n", "  The analysis of polycrystalline materials benefits greatly from accurate\nquantitative descriptions of their grain structures. Laguerre tessellations\napproximate such grain structures very well. However, it is a quite challenging\nproblem to fit a Laguerre tessellation to tomographic data, as a\nhigh-dimensional optimization problem with many local minima must be solved. In\nthis paper, we formulate a version of this optimization problem that can be\nsolved quickly using the cross-entropy method, a robust stochastic optimization\ntechnique that can avoid becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach by applying it to both artificially generated and\nexperimentally produced tomographic data.\n", "  Due to its transverse nature, spin Hall effects (SHE) provide the possibility\nto excite and detect spin currents and magnetization dynamics even in magnetic\ninsulators. Magnetic insulators are outstanding materials for the investigation\nof nonlinear phenomena and for novel low power spintronics applications because\nof their extremely low Gilbert damping. Here, we report on the direct imaging\nof electrically driven spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) in the\nferrimagnetic insulator Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ based on the excitation and\ndetection by SHEs. The driven spin dynamics in Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ is directly\nimaged by spatially-resolved microfocused Brillouin light scattering (BLS)\nspectroscopy. Previously, ST-FMR experiments assumed a uniform precession\nacross the sample, which is not valid in our measurements. A strong spin-wave\nlocalization in the center of the sample is observed indicating the formation\nof a nonlinear, self-localized spin-wave `bullet'.\n", "  We derive the large particle number limit of the Bethe equations for the\nground state of the attractive one-dimensional Bose gas (Lieb-Liniger model) on\na ring and solve it for arbitrary coupling. We show that the ground state of\nthis system can be mapped to the large-N saddle point of Euclidean Yang-Mills\ntheory on a two-sphere with a U(N) gauge group, and the phase transition that\ninterpolates between the homogeneous and solitonic regime is dual to the\nDouglas-Kazakov confimenent-deconfinement phase transition.\n", "  The surface area of electrodeposited thin films of Ni, Co, and NiCo was\nevaluated using electrochemical double-layer capacitance, electrochemical area\nmeasurements using the [Ru(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{3+}$/[Ru(NH$_3$)$_6$]$^{2+}$ redox\ncouple, and topographic atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. These three\nmethods were compared to each other for each composition separately and for the\nentire set of samples regardless of composition. Double-layer capacitance\nmeasurements were found to be positively correlated to the roughness factors\ndetermined by AFM topography. Electrochemical area measurements were found to\nbe less correlated with measured roughness factors as well as applicable only\nto two of the three compositions studied. The results indicate that in situ\ndouble-layer capacitance measurements are a practical, versatile technique for\nestimating the accessible surface area of a metal sample.\n", "  We present the nonlinear 2D galaxy power spectrum, $P(k,\\mu)$, in redshift\nspace, measured from the Dark Sky simulations, using galaxy catalogs\nconstructed with both halo occupation distribution and subhalo abundance\nmatching methods, chosen to represent an intermediate redshift sample of\nluminous red galaxies. We find that the information content in individual $\\mu$\n(cosine of the angle to the line of sight) bins is substantially richer then\nmultipole moments, and show that this can be used to isolate the impact of\nnonlinear growth and redshift space distortion (RSD) effects. Using the\n$\\mu<0.2$ simulation data, which we show is not impacted by RSD effects, we can\nsuccessfully measure the nonlinear bias to an accuracy of $\\sim 5$% at $k<0.6\nh$Mpc$^{-1}$. This use of individual $\\mu $ bins to extract the nonlinear bias\nsuccessfully removes a large parameter degeneracy when constraining the linear\ngrowth rate of structure. We carry out a joint parameter estimation, using the\nlow $\\mu$ simulation data to constrain the nonlinear bias, and $\\mu\\ge0.2$ to\nconstrain the growth rate and show that $f$ can be constrained to $\\sim 26\\,\n(22)$% to a $k_{\\rm max}< 0.4\\, (0.6) h$Mpc$^{-1}$ from clustering alone using\na simple dispersion model, for a range of galaxy models. Our analysis of\nindividual $\\mu $ bins also reveals interesting physical effects which arise\nsimply from different methods of populating halos with galaxies. We find a\nprominent turnaround scale, at which RSD damping effects are greater then the\nnonlinear growth, which differs not only for each $\\mu$ bin but also for each\ngalaxy model. These features may provide unique signatures which could be used\nto shed light on the galaxy-dark matter connection.\n", "  The power of micro-arcsecond ($\\mu$as) astrometry is about to be unleashed.\nESA's Gaia mission, now headed towards the end of the first year of routine\nscience operations, will soon fulfil its promise for revolutionary science in\ncountless aspects of Galactic astronomy and astrophysics. The potential of Gaia\nposition measurements for important contributions to the astrophysics of\nplanetary systems is huge. We focus here on the expectations for detection and\nimproved characterization of 'young' planetary systems in the neighborhood of\nthe Sun using a combination of Gaia $\\mu$as astrometry and direct imaging\ntechniques.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the production and decay of the excited quark\nat the QCD next-to-leading order (NLO) level at the Large Hadron Collider,\nusing the narrow width approximation and helicity amplitudes method. We find\nthat the QCD NLO corrections can tighten the constraints on the model\nparameters and reduce the scale dependencies of the total cross sections. We\ndiscuss the signals of the excited quark production with decay mode\n$q^{\\ast}\\rightarrow q\\gamma$ and $q^{\\ast}\\rightarrow qg$, and present several\nimportant kinematic distributions. Moreover, we give the upper limits of the\nexcited quark excluded mass range and the allowed parameter space for the\ncoupling constants and the excited quark mass.\n", "  We show that, by correctly selecting the probability distribution function\n$p(s)$ for a particle's distance-to-collision, the nonclassical diffusion\nequation can be represented exactly by the nonclassical linear Boltzmann\nequation for an infinite homogeneous medium. This choice of $p(s)$ preserves\nthe $true$ mean-squared free path of the system, which sheds new light on the\nresults obtained in previous work.\n", "  We formulate several criteria under which the symmetries associated with the\nKilling and Killing-Yano tensors on the base space can be lifted to the\nsymmetries of the full warped geometry. The procedure is explicitly illustrated\non several examples, providing new prototypes of spacetimes admitting such\ntensors. In particular, we study a warped product of two Kerr-NUT-(A)dS\nspacetimes and show that it gives rise to a new class of highly symmetric\nvacuum (with cosmological constant) black hole solutions that inherit many of\nthe properties of the Kerr-NUT-(A)dS geometry.\n", "  Studies of molecular clouds and young stars near the sun have provided\ninvaluable insights into the process of star formation. Indeed, much of our\nphysical understanding of this topic has been derived from such studies.\nPerhaps the two most fundamental problems confronting star formation research\ntoday are: 1) determining the origin of stellar mass and 2) deciphering the\nnature of the physical processes that control the star formation rate in\nmolecular gas. As I will briefly outline here, observations and studies of\nlocal star forming regions are making particularly significant contributions\ntoward the solution of both these important problems.\n", "  Similar to static systems, periodically driven systems can host a variety of\ntopologically non-trivial phases. Unlike the case of static Hamiltonians, the\ntopological indices of bulk Floquet bands may fail to describe the presence and\nrobustness of edge states, prompting the search for new invariants. We develop\na unified description of topological phases and their invariants in driven\nsystems, by using scattering theory. We show that scattering matrix invariants\ncorrectly describe the topological phase, even when all bulk Floquet bands are\ntrivial. Additionally, we use scattering theory to introduce and analyze new\nperiodically driven phases, such as weak topological Floquet insulators, for\nwhich invariants were previously unknown. We highlight some of their\nsimilarities with static systems, including robustness to disorder, as well as\nsome of the features unique to driven systems, showing that the weak phase may\nbe destroyed by breaking translational symmetry not in space, but in time.\n", "  Quantum annealing is a promising approach for solving optimization problems,\nbut like all other quantum information processing methods, it requires error\ncorrection to ensure scalability. In this work we experimentally compare two\nquantum annealing correction codes in the setting of antiferromagnetic chains,\nusing two different quantum annealing processors. The lower temperature\nprocessor gives rise to higher success probabilities. The two codes differ in a\nnumber of interesting and important ways, but both require four physical qubits\nper encoded qubit. We find significant performance differences, which we\nexplain in terms of the effective energy boost provided by the respective\nredundantly encoded logical operators of the two codes. The code with the\nhigher energy boost results in improved performance, at the expense of a lower\ndegree encoded graph. Therefore, we find that there exists an important\ntradeoff between encoded connectivity and performance for quantum annealing\ncorrection codes.\n", "  Chimera states are dynamical patterns in networks of coupled oscillators in\nwhich regions of synchronous and asynchronous oscillation coexist. Although\nthese states are typically observed in large ensembles of oscillators and\nanalyzed in the continuum limit, chimeras may also occur in systems with finite\n(and small) numbers of oscillators. Focusing on networks of $2N$ phase\noscillators that are organized in two groups, we find that chimera states,\ncorresponding to attracting periodic orbits, appear with as few as two\noscillators per group and demonstrate that for $N>2$ the bifurcations that\ncreate them are analogous to those observed in the continuum limit. These\nfindings suggest that chimeras, which bear striking similarities to dynamical\npatterns in nature, are observable and robust in small networks that are\nrelevant to a variety of real-world systems.\n", "  We extend gauge symmetry of Abelian gauge field to incorporate quantum gauge\ndegrees of freedom. We twice apply the Harada--Tsutsui gauge recovery procedure\nto gauge-fixed theories. First, starting from the Faddeev--Popov path integral\nin the Landau gauge, we recover the gauge symmetry by introducing an additional\nfield as an extended gauge degree of freedom. Fixing the extended gauge\nsymmetry by the usual Faddeev--Popov procedure, we obtain the theory of Type I\ngaugeon formalism. Next, applying the same procedure to the resulting\ngauge-fixed theory, we obtain a theory equivalent to the extended Type I\ngaugeon formalism.\n", "  We calculate how correlations in a Bose lattice gas grow during a finite\nspeed ramp from the Mott to the Superfluid regime. We use an interacting\ndoublon-holon model, applying a mean-field approach for implementing hard-core\nconstraints between these degrees of freedom. Our solutions are valid in any\ndimension, and agree with experimental results and with DMRG calculations in\none dimension. We find that the final energy density of the system drops\nquickly with increased ramp time for ramps shorter than one hopping time,\n$J\\tau_{ramp}\\lesssim 1$. For longer ramps, the final energy density depends\nonly weakly on ramp speed. We calculate the effects of inelastic light\nscattering during such ramps.\n", "  We consider a classically scale invariant version of the Standard Model,\nextended by an extra dark $SU(2)_X$ gauge group. Apart from the dark gauge\nbosons and a dark scalar doublet which is coupled to the Standard Model Higgs\nthrough a portal coupling, we incorporate right-handed neutrinos and an\nadditional real singlet scalar field. After symmetry breaking \\`a la\nColeman-Weinberg, we examine the multi-Higgs sector and impose theoretical and\nexperimental constraints. In addition, by computing the dark matter relic\nabundance and the spin-independent scattering cross section off a nucleon we\ndetermine the viable dark matter mass range in accordance with present limits.\nThe model can be tested in the near future by collider experiments and direct\ndetection searches such as XENON 1T.\n", "  Astrophysical observations spanning dwarf galaxies to galaxy clusters\nindicate that dark matter (DM) halos are less dense in their central regions\ncompared to expectations from collisionless DM N-body simulations. Using\ndetailed fits to DM halos of galaxies and clusters, we show that\nself-interacting DM (SIDM) may provide a consistent solution to the DM deficit\nproblem across all scales, even though individual systems exhibit a wide\ndiversity in halo properties. Since the characteristic velocity of DM particles\nvaries across these systems, we are able to measure the self-interaction cross\nsection as a function of kinetic energy and thereby deduce the SIDM particle\nphysics model parameters. Our results prefer a mildly velocity-dependent cross\nsection, from $\\sigma/m \\simeq 2\\; {\\rm cm^2/g}$ on galaxy scales to $\\sigma/m\n\\simeq 0.1\\; {\\rm cm^2/g}$ on cluster scales, consistent with the upper limits\nfrom merging clusters. Our results dramatically improve the constraints on SIDM\nmodels and may allow the masses of both DM and dark mediator particles to be\nmeasured even if the dark sector is completely hidden from the Standard Model,\nwhich we illustrate for the dark photon model.\n", "  We evaluate the two-photon exchange (TPE) correction to the unpolarized\nelastic electron-proton scattering at small momentum transfer $ Q^2 $. We\naccount for the inelastic intermediate states approximating the double virtual\nCompton scattering by the unpolarized forward virtual Compton scattering. The\nunpolarized proton structure functions are used as input for the numerical\nevaluation of the inelastic contribution. Our calculation reproduces the\nleading terms in the $ Q^2 $ expansion of the TPE correction and goes beyond\nthis approximation by keeping the full $ Q^2 $ dependence of the proton\nstructure functions. In the range of small momentum transfer, our result is in\ngood agreement with the empirical TPE fit to existing data.\n", "  Einstein-Maxwell theory conformally coupled to a scalar field in D dimensions\nmay exhibit an instability at low temperature. We find an explicit solution\nthat represents a charged asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black hole with a\nscalar field profile that is regular everywhere outside and on the horizon.\nThis provides a tractable model to study the phase transition of hairy black\nholes in Anti-de Sitter space in which the backreaction on the geometry can be\nsolved analytically.\n", "  Scattering data can be generically described in terms of monodromies. Here we\nobtain scattering amplitudes for conformally coupled scalar fields in Kerr-de\nSitter black holes using this monodromy technique. The only non-trivial\nparameter, the composite monodromy parameter $\\sigma_{ij}$ between two regular\nsingular points, can be solved implicitily in terms of the Painlev\\'e VI\n$\\tau$-function. The application of the Virasoro conformal blocks to solve the\nlatter can now be interpreted as a verification of the striking relationship\nbetween conformal symmetry and black holes.\n", "  We propose an approach to quantum phase estimation that can attain precision\nnear the Heisenberg limit without requiring single-particle-resolved state\ndetection. We show that the \"one-axis twisting\" interaction, well known for\ngenerating spin squeezing in atomic ensembles, can also amplify the output\nsignal of an entanglement-enhanced interferometer to facilitate readout.\nApplying this interaction-based readout to oversqueezed, non-Gaussian states\nyields a Heisenberg scaling in phase sensitivity, which persists in the\npresence of detection noise as large as the quantum projection noise of an\nunentangled ensemble. Even in dissipative implementations -- e.g., employing\nlight-mediated interactions in an optical cavity or Rydberg dressing -- the\nmethod significantly relaxes the detection resolution required for spectroscopy\nbeyond the standard quantum limit.\n", "  We demonstrate a robust experimental method for determining the depth of\nindividual shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with $\\sim1$ nm\nuncertainty. We use a confocal microscope to observe single NV centers and\ndetect the proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal produced by objective\nimmersion oil, which has well understood nuclear spin properties, on the\ndiamond surface. We determine the NV center depth by analyzing the NV NMR data\nusing a model that describes the interaction of a single NV center with the\nstatistically-polarized proton spin bath. We repeat this procedure for a large\nnumber of individual, shallow NV centers and compare the resulting NV depths to\nthe mean value expected from simulations of the ion implantation process used\nto create the NV centers, with reasonable agreement.\n", "  For $N$ spin-polarized fermions with harmonic pair interactions in a\n$1$-dimensional trap an odd-even effect is found. The spectrum of the\n$1$-particle reduced density matrix of the system's ground state differs\nqualitatively for $N$ odd and $N$ even. This effect does only occur for strong\nattractive and repulsive interactions. Since it does not exists for bosons, it\nmust originate from the repulsive nature implied by the fermionic exchange\nstatistics. In contrast to the spectrum, the $1$-particle density and\ncorrelation function for strong attractive interactions do not show any\nsensitivity on the number parity. This also suggests that\nreduced-density-matrix-functional theory has a more subtle $N$-dependency than\ndensity functional theory.\n", "  We consider a (2+1)-dimensional holographic CFT on a static spacetime with\nglobally timelike Killing vector. Taking the spatial geometry to be closed but\notherwise general we expect a non-trivial vacuum energy at zero temperature due\nto the Casimir effect. We assume a thermal state has an AdS/CFT dual\ndescription as a static smooth solution to gravity with a negative cosmological\nconstant, which ends only on the conformal boundary or horizons. A bulk\ngeometric argument then provides an upper bound on the ratio of CFT free energy\nto temperature. Considering the zero temperature limit of this bound implies\nthe vacuum energy of the CFT is non-positive. Furthermore the vacuum energy\nmust be negative unless the boundary metric is locally conformal to a product\nof time with a constant curvature space. We emphasise the argument does not\nrequire the zero temperature bulk geometry to be smooth, but only that\nsingularities are `good' so are hidden by horizons at finite temperature.\n", "  We derive the continuum equations and boundary conditions governing\nphonon-mediated heat transfer in the limit of small but finite mean free path\nfrom asymptotic solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation in the relaxation\ntime approximation. Our approach uses the ratio of the mean free path to the\ncharacteristic system lengthscale, also known as the Knudsen number, as the\nexpansion parameter to study the effects of boundaries on the breakdown of the\nFourier descrition. We show that, in the bulk, the traditional heat conduction\nequation using Fourier's law as a constitutive relation is valid at least up to\nsecond order in the Knudsen number for steady problems and first order for\ntime-dependent problems. However, this description does not hold within\ndistances on the order of a few mean free paths from the boundary; this\nbreakdown is a result of kinetic effects that are always present in the\nboundary vicinity and require solution of a Boltzmann boundary-layer problem to\nbe determined. Matching the inner, boundary layer, solution to the outer, bulk,\nsolution yields boundary conditions for the Fourier description as well as\nadditive corrections in the form of universal kinetic boundary layers; both are\nfound to be proportional to the bulk-solution gradients at the boundary and\nparametrized by the material model and the phonon-boundary interaction model\n(Boltzmann boundary condition). Our derivation shows that the traditional\nno-jump boundary condition for prescribed temperature boundaries and no-flux\nboundary condition for diffusely reflecting boundaries are appropriate only to\nzeroth order in the Knudsen number; at higher order, boundary conditions are of\nthe jump type. We illustrate the utility of the asymptotic solution procedure\nby demonstrating that it can be used to predict the Kapitza resistance (and\ntemperature jump) associated with an interface between two materials.\n", "  Quantum vacuum fluctuations impose strict limits on precision displacement\nmeasurements, those of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors among them.\nIntroducing squeezed states into an interferometer's readout port can improve\nthe sensitivity of the instrument, leading to richer astrophysical\nobservations. However, optomechanical interactions dictate that the vacuum's\nsqueezed quadrature must rotate by 90 degrees around 50Hz. Here we use a\n2-m-long, high-finesse optical resonator to produce frequency-dependent\nrotation around 1.2kHz. This demonstration of audio-band frequency-dependent\nsqueezing uses technology and methods that are scalable to the required\nrotation frequency, heralding application of the technique in future\ngravitational-wave detectors.\n", "  We study the propagator of a colored scalar particle in the background of a\nnon-abelian gauge field using the worldline formalism. It is obtained by\nconsidering the open worldline of a scalar particle with extra degrees of\nfreedom needed to take into account the color charge of the particle, which we\nchoose to be in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. Specializing\nthe external gauge field to be given by a sum of plane waves, i.e. a sum of\nexternal gluons, we produce a master formula for the scalar propagator with an\narbitrary number of gluons directly attached to the scalar line, akin to\nsimilar formulas derived in the literature for the case of the scalar particle\nperforming a loop. Our worldline description produces at the same time the\nsituation in which the particle has a color charge given by an arbitrarily\nchosen symmetric or antisymmetric tensor product of the fundamental.\n", "  We obtain thermostatted ring polymer molecular dynamics (TRPMD) from exact\nquantum dynamics via Matsubara dynamics, a recently-derived form of\nlinearization which conserves the quantum Boltzmann distribution. Performing a\ncontour integral in the complex quantum Boltzmann distribution of Matsubara\ndynamics, replacement of the imaginary Liouvillian which results with a\nFokker-Planck term gives TRPMD. We thereby provide error terms between TRPMD\nand quantum dynamics and predict the systems in which they are likely to be\nsmall. Using a harmonic analysis we show that careful addition of friction\ncauses the correct oscillation frequency of the higher ring-polymer normal\nmodes in a harmonic well, which we illustrate with calculation of the\nposition-squared autocorrelation function. However, no physical friction\nparameter will produce the correct fluctuation dynamics for a parabolic\nbarrier. The results in this paper are consistent with previous numerical\nstudies and advise the use of TRPMD for the computation of spectra.\n", "  Artificial magnetic fields (AMFs) created for ultra cold systems depend\nsensitively on the internal structure of the atoms. In a mixture, each\ncomponent experiences a different AMF depending on its internal state. This\nenables the study of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing of fermions with unequal\neffective charges. In this Letter, we investigate the superconducting (SC)\ntransition of a system formed by such pairs as a function of field strength. We\nconsider a homogeneous two-component Fermi gas of unequal effective charges but\nequal densities with attractive interactions. We find that the phase diagram is\naltered drastically compared to the usual balanced charge case. First, for some\nAMFs there is no SC transition and isolated SC phases are formed, reflecting\nthe discrete Landau level (LL) structure. SC phases become reentrant both in\nAMF and temperature. For extremely high fields where both components are\nconfined to their lowest LLs, the effect of the charge imbalance is suppressed.\nCharge asymmetry reduces the critical temperature even in the low-field\nsemiclassical regime. We discuss a pair breaking mechanism due to the unequal\nLorentz forces acting on the components of the Cooper pairs to identify the\nunderlying physics.\n", "  Alkali-metal (potassium) adsorption on FeSe thin films with thickness from\ntwo unit cells (UC) to 4-UC on SrTiO3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy is\ninvestigated with a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. At\nappropriate potassium coverage (0.2-0.3 monolayer), the tunneling spectra of\nthe films all exhibit a superconducting-like gap larger than 11 meV (five times\nthe gap value of bulk FeSe), and two distinct features of characteristic phonon\nmodes at 11 meV and 21 meV. The results reveal the critical role of the\ninterface enhanced electron-phonon coupling for possible high temperature\nsuperconductivity in the system and is consistent with recent theories. Our\nstudy provides compelling evidence for the conventional pairing mechanism for\nthis type of heterostructure superconducting systems.\n", "  By using the scaling symmetry in the reduced action formalism, we derive the\nnovel Smarr relation which holds even for the hairy rotating AdS_3 black holes.\nAnd then, by using the Smarr relation we argue that the hairy rotating AdS_3\nblack holes are stable thermodynamically, compared to the non-hairy ones.\n", "  We derive the quantum analogue of a B\\\"acklund transformation for the\nquantised Ablowitz-Ladik chain, a space discretisation of the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The quantisation of the Ablowitz-Ladik chain leads to\nthe $q$-boson model. Using a previous construction of Baxter's Q-operator for\nthis model by the author, a set of functional relations is obtained which\nmatches the relations of a one-variable classical B\\\"acklund transform to all\norders in $\\hbar $. We construct also a second Q-operator and show that it is\nclosely related to the inverse of the first. The multi-B\\\"acklund transforms\ngenerated from the Q-operator define the fusion matrices of a 2D TQFT and we\nderive a linear system for the solution to the quantum B\\\"acklund relations in\nterms of the TQFT fusion coefficients.\n", "  In effective models of loop quantum cosmology, the holonomy corrections are\nassociated with deformations of space-time symmetries. The most evident\nmanifestation of the deformations is the emergence of an Euclidean phase\naccompanying the non-singular bouncing dynamics of the scale factor. In this\narticle, we compute the power spectrum of scalar perturbations generated in\nthis model, with a massive scalar field as the matter content. Instantaneous\nand adiabatic vacuum-type initial conditions for scalar perturbations are\nimposed in the contracting phase. The evolution through the Euclidean region is\ncalculated based on the extrapolation of the time direction pointed by the\nvectors normal to the Cauchy hypersurface in the Lorentzian domains. The\nobtained power spectrum is characterized by a suppression in the IR regime and\noscillations in the intermediate energy range. Furthermore, the speculative\nextension of the analysis in the UV reveals a specific rise of the power.\n", "  Coherent control of quantum systems has far-reaching implications in quantum\nengineering. In this context, coherent population trapping (CPT) involving dark\nresonances has played a prominent role, leading to a wealth of major\napplications including laser cooling of atoms and molecules, optical\nmagnetometry, light storage and highly precise atomic clocks. Extending CPT\nmethods to individual solid-state quantum systems has been only achieved in\ncryogenic environments for electron spin impurities and superconducting\ncircuits. Here, we demonstrate efficient CPT of a single nuclear spin in a room\ntemperature solid. To this end, we make use of a three-level system with a\n$\\Lambda$-configuration in the microwave domain, which consists of nuclear spin\nstates addressed through their hyperfine coupling to the electron spin of a\nsingle nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond. Dark state pumping requires a\nrelaxation mechanism which, in atomic systems, is simply provided by\nspontaneous emission. In this work, the relaxation process is externally\ncontrolled through incoherent optical pumping and separated in time from\nconsecutive coherent microwave excitations of the nuclear spin\n$\\Lambda$-system. Such a pumping scheme with controlled relaxation allows us\n(i) to monitor the sequential accumulation of population into the dark state\nand (ii) to reach a new regime of CPT dynamics for which periodic arrays of\ndark resonances can be observed, owing to multiple constructive interferences.\nThis work offers new prospects for quantum state preparation, information\nstorage in hybrid quantum systems and metrology.\n", "  The existence of higher order entanglement in the stimulated and spontaneous\nRaman processes is established using the perturbative solutions of the\nHeisenberg equations of motion for various field modes that are obtained using\nthe Sen-Mandal technique and a fully quantum mechanical Hamiltonian that\ndescribes the stimulated and spontaneous Raman processes. Specifically, the\nperturbative Sen-Mandal solutions are exploited here to show the signature of\nthe higher order two-mode and multi-mode entanglement. In some special cases,\nwe have also observed higher order entanglement in the partially spontaneous\nRaman processes. Further, it is shown that the depth of the nonclassicality\nindicators (parameters) can be manipulated by the specific choice of coupling\nconstants, and it is observed that the depth of nonclassicality parameters\nincreases with the order.\n", "  The top partner as a hallmark of the Littlest Higgs model with $T$-parity\n(LHT model) has been extensively searched for during the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) Run-1. With the increasing mass limits on the top partner, the single\nproduction of the top partner will be dominant over the pair production. Under\nthe constraints from the Higgs data, the electroweak precision observables and\n$R_b$, we find that the mass of $T$-even top partner ($T_+$) has to be heavier\nthan 730 GeV. Then, we investigate the observability of the single $T$-even top\npartner production through the process $pp \\to T_+ j$ with the sequent decay\n$T_+ \\to th$ in the di-photon channel in the LHT model at the LHC. We find that\nthe mass of $T_+$ can be excluded up to 800 GeV at $2\\sigma$ level at 14 TeV\nLHC with the integrated luminosity ${\\cal L}=3$ ab$^{-1}$.\n", "  The many-body localization transition (MBLT) between ergodic and many-body\nlocalized phase in disordered interacting systems is a subject of much recent\ninterest. Statistics of eigenenergies is known to be a powerful probe of\ncrossovers between ergodic and integrable systems in simpler examples of\nquantum chaos. We consider the evolution of the spectral statistics across the\nMBLT, starting with mapping to a Brownian motion process that analytically\nrelates the spectral properties to the statistics of matrix elements. We\ndemonstrate that the flow from Wigner-Dyson to Poisson statistics is a\ntwo-stage process. First, fractal enhancement of matrix elements upon\napproaching the MBLT from the metallic side produces an effective power-law\ninteraction between energy levels, and leads to a plasma model for level\nstatistics. At the second stage, the gas of eigenvalues has local interaction\nand level statistics belongs to a semi-Poisson universality class. We verify\nour findings numerically on the XXZ spin chain. We provide a microscopic\nunderstanding of the level statistics across the MBLT and discuss implications\nfor the transition that are strong constraints on possible theories.\n", "  We give an analytic construction of a class of two-qubit gate pulse sequences\nthat act on five of the six spin-$\\frac12$ particles used to encode a pair of\nexchange-only three-spin qubits. Within this class, the problem of gate\nconstruction reduces to that of finding a smaller sequence that acts on four\nspins and is subject to a simple constraint. The optimal sequence satisfying\nthis constraint yields a two-qubit gate sequence equivalent to that found\nnumerically by Fong and Wandzura. Our construction is sufficiently simple that\nit can be carried out entirely with pen, paper, and knowledge of a few basic\nfacts about quantum spin. We thereby analytically derive the Fong-Wandzura\nsequence that has so far escaped intuitive explanation.\n", "  Great attention is given to the first star formation and the epoch of\nreionization as main targets of planned large radio interferometries (e.g.\nSquare Kilometre Array). Recently, it is claimed that the supersonic relative\nvelocity between baryons and cold dark matter can suppress the abundance of\nfirst stars and impact the cosmological reionization process. Therefore, in\norder to compare observed results with theoretical predictions it is important\nto examine the effect of the supersonic relative motion on the small-scale\nstructure formation. In this paper, we investigate this effect on the nonlinear\nstructure formation in the context of the spherical collapse model in order to\nunderstand the fundamental physics in a simple configuration. We show the\nevolution of the dark matter sphere with the relative velocity by both using\nN-body simulations and numerically calculating the equation of motion for the\ndark matter mass shell. The effects of the relative motion in the spherical\ncollapse model appear as the delay of the collapse time of dark matter halos\nand the decrease of the baryon mass fraction within the dark matter sphere.\nBased on these results, we provide the fitting formula of the critical density\ncontrast for collapses with the relative motion effect and calculate the mass\nfunction of dark matter halos in the Press-Schechter formalism. As a result,\nthe relative velocity decreases the abundance of dark matter halos whose mass\nis smaller than $10^8~M_\\odot/h$.\n", "  In this paper we show that the most luminous supernova discovered very\nrecently, ASASSN-15lh, could have been powered by a newborn\nultra-strongly-magnetized pulsar, which initially rotates near the Kepler\nlimit. We find that if this pulsar is a neutron star, its rotational energy\ncould be quickly lost as a result of gravitational-radiation-driven r-mode\ninstability; if it is a strange quark star, however, this instability is highly\nsuppressed due to a large bulk viscosity associated with the nonleptonic weak\ninteraction among quarks and thus most of its rotational energy could be\nextracted to drive ASASSN-15lh. Therefore, we conclude that such an\nultra-energetic supernova provides a possible signature for the birth of a\nstrange quark star.\n", "  We study how topological phases evolve in the Kane-Mele-Kondo lattice at\nfinite temperatures and obtain the topological Doniach phase diagram. In\nparticular, we find an intriguing crossover behavior induced by the interplay\nbetween the topological structure and electron correlations; the topological\nproperties are restored by temperature effects. This restoration can be\nobserved in the behavior of the bulk as well as the edge. In the bulk, we\nobserve an increase of the spin-Hall conductivity at finite temperatures, while\nit is zero in the low temperature region. At the edge, we observe gapless edge\nmodes emerging with increasing temperature.\n", "  We propose to use a cryogenic nonlinear resonator for the projective readout,\nclassical memory, and feedback for a superconducting qubit. This approach\nsidesteps many of the inefficiencies inherent in two-way communication between\ntemperature stages in typical systems with room temperature controllers, and\navoids increasing the cryogenic heat load. This controller may find a broad\nrange of uses in multi-qubit systems, but here we analyze two specific\ndemonstrative cases in single qubit-control. In the first case, the nonlinear\ncontroller is used to initialize the qubit in a definite eigenstate. And in the\nsecond case, the qubit's state is read into the controller's classical memory,\nwhere it is stored for an indefinite period of time, and then used to reinstate\nthe measured state after the qubit has decayed. We analyze the properties of\nthis system and we show simulations of the time evolution for the full system\ndynamics.\n", "  A search for a Higgs boson produced via vector-boson fusion and decaying into\ninvisible particles is presented, using 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton\ncollision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS\ndetector at the LHC. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV, assuming the\nStandard Model production cross section, an upper bound of 0.28 is set on the\nbranching fraction of $H\\to$ invisible at 95% confidence level, where the\nexpected upper limit is 0.31. The results are interpreted in models of\nHiggs-portal dark matter where the branching fraction limit is converted into\nupper bounds on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering cross section as a function\nof the dark-matter particle mass, and compared to results from the direct\ndark-matter detection experiments.\n", "  The covariance matrices of power-spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy\nsurveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to\nestimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number\nof mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require\nthousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired\naccuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with\nthe number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a\nmethod of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified,\nfew-parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS\nDR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit\nthe covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed\nwith this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks\nand only ~100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse\ncovariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method should work equally\nwell for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher\naccuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.\n", "  We present new photometric and spectroscopic data for the M-type members of\nthe TW Hya association with the aim of a comprehensive study of accretion,\ndisks and magnetic activity at the critical age of ~10 Myr where circumstellar\nmatter disappears.\n", "  In this work, we analyze the necessary conditions for a nonlinear AdS-type\ninstability in the gravity-scalar field system. In particular, we discuss the\nnecessary conditions for a cascade of energy to higher modes by applying\nresults in KAM theory. Our analytical framework explains numerical observations\nof instability of spacetimes even when the spectrum is only asymptotically\nresonant, and the fact that a minimum field amplitude is needed to trigger it.\nOur framework can be applied for similar stability analyses of fields in\n(locally) asymptotically AdS spacetimes. We illustrate this with the example of\nthe AdS soliton. Further, we conjecture on the possible reasons for\nquasi-periodic behaviour observed in perturbations of AdS spacetime. Certain\nproperties of the eigenfunctions of the linear system dictate whether there\nwill be localization in space leading to black hole formation. These properties\nare examined using the asymptotics of Jacobi polynomials. Finally we discuss\nrecent results on the AdS instability in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light\nof our work.\n", "  Colloidal systems observed in video microscopy are often analysed using the\ndisplacements correlation matrix of particle positions. In non-thermal systems,\nthe inverse of this matrix can be interpreted as a pair-interaction potential\nbetween particles. If the system is thermally agitated, however, only an\neffective interaction is accessible from the correlation matrix. We show how\nthis effective interaction differs from the non-thermal case by comparing with\nhigh-statistics numerical data from hard-sphere crystals.\n", "  We present results for the matrix elements of the additional $\\Delta S=2$\noperators that appear in models of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM),\nexpressed in terms of four BSM $B$-parameters. Combined with experimental\nresults for $\\Delta M_K$ and $\\epsilon_K$, these constrain the parameters of\nBSM models. We use improved staggered fermions, with valence HYP-smeared quarks\nand $N_f=2+1$ flavors of \"asqtad\" sea quarks. The configurations have been\ngenerated by the MILC collaboration. The matching between lattice and continuum\nfour-fermion operators and bilinears is done perturbatively at one-loop order.\nWe use three lattice spacings for the continuum extrapolation: $a\\approx 0.09$,\n$0.06$ and $0.045\\;$fm. Valence light-quark masses range down to $\\approx\nm_s^{\\rm phys}/13$ while the light sea-quark masses range down to $\\approx\nm_s^{\\rm phys}/20$. Compared to our previous published work, we have added four\nadditional lattice ensembles, leading to better controlled extrapolations in\nthe lattice spacing and sea-quark masses. We report final results for two\nrenormalization scales, $\\mu=2\\;\\text{GeV}$ and $3\\;\\text{GeV}$, and compare\nthem to those obtained by other collaborations. Agreement is found for two of\nthe four BSM $B$-parameters ($B_2$ and $B_3^\\text{SUSY}$). The other two ($B_4$\nand $B_5$) differ significantly from those obtained using RI-MOM\nrenormalization as an intermediate scheme, but are in agreement with recent\npreliminary results obtained by the RBC-UKQCD collaboration using RI-SMOM\nintermediate schemes.\n", "  In the present work we show, analytically and numerically, that the variance\nof many-particle operators and their uncertainty product for an\nout-of-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) can deviate from the outcome\nof the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics, even in the limit of infinite\nnumber of particles and at constant interaction parameter when the system\nbecomes 100% condensed. We demonstrate our finding on the dynamics of the\ncenter-of-mass position--momentum uncertainty product of a freely expanding as\nwell as of a trapped BEC. This time-dependent many-body phenomenon is explained\nby the existence of time-dependent correlations which manifest themselves in\nthe system's reduced two-body density matrix used to evaluate the uncertainty\nproduct. Our work demonstrates that one has to use a many-body propagation\ntheory to describe an out-of-equilibrium BEC, even in the infinite particle\nlimit.\n", "  A new scalar measure of the gyrotropy of a pressure tensor is defined.\nPreviously suggested measures are shown to be incomplete by means of examples\nfor which they give unphysical results. To demonstrate its usefulness as an\nindicator of magnetic topology, the new measure is calculated for electron data\ntaken from numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection, shown to peak at\nseparatrices and X-points, and compared to the other measures. The new\ndiagnostic has potential uses in analyzing spacecraft observations and so a\nmethod for calculating it from measurements performed in an arbitrary\ncoordinate system is derived.\n", "  Within a cosmological context, we study the behaviour of collisionless\nparticles in the weak field approximation to General Relativity, allowing for\nlarge gradients of the fields and relativistic velocities for the particles. We\nconsider a spherically symmetric setup such that high resolution simulations\nare possible with minimal computational resources. We test our formalism by\ncomparing it to two exact solutions: the Schwarzschild solution and the\nLema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi model. In order to make the comparison we consider\nredshifts and lensing angles of photons passing through the simulation. These\nare both observable quantities and hence are gauge independent. We demonstrate\nthat our scheme is more accurate than a Newtonian scheme, correctly reproducing\nthe leading-order post-Newtonian correction. In addition, our setup is able to\nhandle shell-crossings, which is not possible within a fluid model.\nFurthermore, by introducing angular momentum, we find configurations\ncorresponding to bound objects which may prove useful for numerical studies of\nthe effects of modified gravity, dynamical dark energy models or even compact\nbound objects within General Relativity.\n", "  Motile and driven particles confined in microfluidic channels exhibit\ninteresting emergent behavior from propagating density bands to density shock\nwaves. A deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for these\nemergent structures is relevant to a number of physical and biomedical\napplications. Here, we study the formation of density shock waves in the\ncontext of an idealized model of microswimmers confined in a narrow channel and\nsubject to a uniform external flow. Interestingly, these density shock waves\nexhibit a transition from `subsonic' with compression at the back to\n`supersonic' with compression at the front of the population as the intensity\nof the external flow increases. This behavior is the result of a non-trivial\ninterplay between hydrodynamic interactions and geometric confinement, and is\nconfirmed by a novel quasilinear wave model that properly captures the\ndependence of the shock formation on the external flow. These findings can be\nused to guide the development of novel mechanisms for controlling the emergent\ndensity distribution and average population speed, with potentially profound\nimplications on various processes in industry and biotechnology such as the\ntransport and sorting of cells in flow channels.\n", "  A new way to write the massive scalar and fermion propagators on a background\nof a weak gauge field is presented. They are written in a form that is\nmanifestly gauge-covariant up to several additional terms that can be written\nas boundary terms in momentum space. These additional terms violate\nWard-Takahashi identities and need to be renormalized by appropriate\ncounterterms if the complete theory is to be gauge-covariant. This form makes\nit possible to calculate many amplitudes in a manifestly gauge-covariant way\n(at the same time reducing the number of Feynman diagrams). It also allows to\nexpress some counterterms in a way independent of the regularization scheme and\nprovides an easy way to derive the anomalous term affecting the chiral current\nconservation.\n", "  InGaN is an ideal alloy system for optoelectronic devices due its tunable\nband gap. Yet high-quality InGaN requires high In concentration, which is a\nchallenging issue that limits its use in green-light LEDs and other devices. In\nthis paper, we investigated the surfactant effect of Sb on the In incorporation\non InGaN (000-1) surface via first-principles approaches. Surface phase diagram\nwas also constructed to determine surface structures under different growth\nconditions. By analyzing surface stress under different structures, we found\nthat Sb adatom can induce tensile sites in the cation layer, enhancing the In\nincorporation. These fi ndings may provide fundamental understandings and\nguidelines for the growth of InGaN with high In concentration.\n", "  Spin-flip scattering of charge carriers in metals with magnetic defects leads\nto the low-temperature saturation of the decoherence time, $\\tau_\\varphi$, of\nelectrons at the value comparable to their spin relaxation time, $\\tau_s$. In\ntwo-dimensional (2D) conductors such a saturation can be lifted by an in-plane\nmagnetic field, $B_\\parallel$, which polarizes spins of scatterers without\naffecting orbital motion of free carriers. Here, we show that in 2D conductors\nwith substantially different values of the g-factors of electrons ($g_e$) and\nmagnetic defects ($g_i$), the decoherence time $\\tau_\\varphi(B_\\parallel)$\n(reflected by the curvature of magnetoconductance) displays an anomaly: it\nfirst gets shorter, decaying on the scale $B_\\parallel\\sim \\hbar/|g_i-g_e|\\mu_B\n\\tau_s$, before becoming longer at higher values of $B_\\parallel$.\n", "  Electron-positron pair production by the Breit-Wheeler process embedded in a\nstrong laser pulse is analyzed. The transverse momentum spectrum displays\nprominent peaks which are interpreted as caustics, the positions of which are\naccessible by the stationary phases. Examples are given for the superposition\nof an XFEL beam with an optical high-intensity laser beam. Such a configuration\nis available, e.g., at LCLS at present and at European XFEL in near future. It\nrequires a counter propagating probe photon beam with high energy which can be\ngenerated by synchronized inverse Compton backscattering.\n", "  We investigate the electromechanical coupling in 2d materials. For\nnon-Bravais lattices, we find important corrections to the standard macroscopic\nstrain - microscopic atomic-displacement theory. We put forward a general and\nsystematic approach to calculate strain-displacement relations for several\nclasses of 2d materials. We apply our findings to graphene as a study case, by\ncombining a tight binding and a valence force-field model to calculate\nelectronic and mechanical properties of graphene nanoribbons under strain. The\nresults show good agreement with the predictions of the Dirac equation coupled\nto continuum mechanics. For this long wave-limit effective theory, we find that\nthe strain-displacement relations lead to a renormalization correction to the\nstrain-induced pseudo-magnetic fields. Implications for nanomechanical\nproperties and electromechanical coupling in 2d materials are discussed.\n", "  Merging galaxy systems provides observational evidence of the existence of\ndark matter and constraints on its properties. Therefore, statistical uniform\nsamples of merging systems would be a powerful tool for several studies. In\nthis work we presents a new methodology for merging systems identification and\nthe results of its application to galaxy redshift surveys. We use as starting\npoint a mock catalogue of galaxy systems, identified using traditional FoF\nalgorithms, which experienced a major merger as indicated by its merger tree.\nApplying machine learning techniques in this training sample, and using several\nfeatures computed from the observable properties of galaxy members, it is\npossible to select galaxy groups with a high probability of have been\nexperienced a major merger. Next we apply clustering techniques on galaxy\nmembers in order to reconstruct the properties of the haloes involved in such\nmerger. This methodology provides a highly reliable sample of merging systems\nwith low contamination and precise recovered properties. We apply our\ntechniques in samples of galaxy systems obtained from SDSS-DR7, WINGS and HeCS.\nOur results recover previously known merging systems and provide several new\ncandidates. We present its measured properties and discuss future analysis on\ncurrent and forthcoming samples.\n", "  This paper introduces a new structural phase field crystal (PFC) type model\nthat expands the PFC methodology to a wider class of structurally complex\ncrystal structures than previously possible. Specifically, our new approach\nallows for stabilization of graphene, as well as its coexistence with a\ndisordered phase. It also preserves the ability to model the usual triangular\nand square lattices previously reported in 2D PFC studies. Our approach is\nguided by the formalism of the classical field theory, wherein the the free\nenergy functional is expanded to third order in PFC density correlations. It\ndiffers from previous PFC approaches in two main features. First, it utilizes a\nhard-sphere repulsion to describe two-point correlations. Second, and more\nimportant, is that it uses a rotationally invariant three-point correlation\nfunction that provides a unified way to control the formation of crystalline\nstructures that can be described by a specific bond angle, such as graphene,\ntriangular or square symmetries. Our new approach retains much of the\ncomputational simplicity of previous PFC models and allows for efficient\nsimulation of nucleation and growth of polycrystalline 2D materials. In\npreparation for future applications, this paper details the mathematical\nderivation of the model and its equilibrium properties, and uses dynamical\nsimulations to demonstrate defect structures produced by the model.\n", "  This paper introduces two new closely related betweenness centrality measures\nbased on the Randomized Shortest Paths (RSP) framework, which fill a gap\nbetween traditional network centrality measures based on shortest paths and\nmore recent methods considering random walks or current flows. The framework\ndefines Boltzmann probability distributions over paths of the network which\nfocus on the shortest paths, but also take into account longer paths depending\non an inverse temperature parameter. RSP's have previously proven to be useful\nin defining distance measures on networks. In this work we study their utility\nin quantifying the importance of the nodes of a network. The proposed RSP\nbetweenness centralities combine, in an optimal way, the ideas of using the\nshortest and purely random paths for analysing the roles of network nodes,\navoiding issues involving these two paradigms. We present the derivations of\nthese measures and how they can be computed in an efficient way. In addition,\nwe show with real world examples the potential of the RSP betweenness\ncentralities in identifying interesting nodes of a network that more\ntraditional methods might fail to notice.\n", "  We derive the first ever on-shell recursion relations for amplitudes in\neffective field theories. Based solely on factorization and the soft behavior\nof amplitudes, these recursion relations employ a new rescaling momentum shift\nto construct all tree-level scattering amplitudes in theories like the non-\nlinear sigma model, Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and the Galileon. Our results\nprove that all theories with enhanced soft behavior are on-shell constructible.\n", "  The effects of carrier-impurity correlations due to a Kondo-like spin-spin\ninteraction in diluted magnetic semiconductors are investigated. These\ncorrelations are not only responsible for a transfer of spins between the\ncarriers and the impurities, but also produce non-perturbative effects in the\nspin dynamics such as renormalization of the precession frequency of the\ncarrier spins, which can reach values of several percent in CdMnTe quantum\nwells. In two-dimensional systems, the precession frequency renormalization for\na single electron spin with defined wave vector shows logarithmic divergences\nsimilar to those also known from the Kondo problem in metals. For smooth\nelectron distributions, however, the divergences disappear due to the\nintegrability of the logarithm. A possible dephasing mechanism caused by the\nwave-vector dependence of the electron spin precession frequencies is found to\nbe of minor importance compared to the spin transfer from the carrier to the\nimpurity system. In the Markov limit of the theory, a quasi-equilibrium\nexpression for the carrier-impurity correlation energy can be deduced\nindicating the formation of strongly correlated carrier-impurity states for\ntemperatures in the mK range.\n", "  The Standard Model gauge group can be extended with minimal matter content by\nintroducing anomaly free U(1) symmetry, such as $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ or\n$L_e-L_{\\tau}$. If the neutral gauge boson corresponding to this abelian\nsymmetry is ultra-light, then it will give rise to flavor-dependent long-range\nleptonic force, which can have significant impact on neutrino oscillations. For\nan instance, the electrons inside the Sun can generate a flavor-dependent\nlong-range potential at the Earth surface, which can suppress the $\\nu_{\\mu}\n\\to \\nu_e$ appearance probability in terrestrial experiments. The sign of this\npotential is opposite for anti-neutrinos, and affects the oscillations of\n(anti-)neutrinos in different fashion. This feature invokes fake CP-asymmetry\nlike the SM matter effect and can severely affect the leptonic CP-violation\nsearches in long-baseline experiments. In this paper, we study in detail the\npossible impacts of these long-range flavor-diagonal neutral current\ninteractions due to $L_e-L_{\\mu}$ symmetry, when (anti-)neutrinos travel from\nFermilab to Homestake (1300 km) and CERN to Pyh\\\"asalmi (2290 km) in the\ncontext of future high-precision superbeam facilities, DUNE and LBNO\nrespectively. If there is no signal of long-range force, DUNE (LBNO) can place\nstringent constraint on the effective gauge coupling $\\alpha_{e\\mu} < 1.9\n\\times 10^{-53}~(7.8 \\times 10^{-54})$ at 90% C.L., which is almost 30 (70)\ntimes better than the existing bound from the Super-Kamiokande experiment. We\nalso observe that if $\\alpha_{e\\mu} \\geq 2 \\times 10^{-52}$, the CP-violation\ndiscovery reach of these future facilities vanishes completely. The mass\nhierarchy measurement remains robust in DUNE (LBNO) if $\\alpha_{e\\mu} < 5\n\\times 10^{-52}~(10^{-52})$.\n", "  In mechanically driven superfluid turbulence the mean velocities of the\nnormal- and superfluid components are known to coincide: $\\mathbf U_{\\text{n}}\n=\\mathbf U_{\\text{s}}$. Numerous laboratory, numerical and analytical studies\nshowed that under these conditions the mutual friction between the normal- and\nsuperfluid velocity components couples also their fluctuations: $\\mathbf\nu'_{\\text{n}}(\\mathbf r,t) \\approx \\mathbf u'_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf r,t)$ almost\nat all scales. In this paper we show that this is not the case in thermally\ndriven superfluid turbulence; here the counterflow velocity $\\mathbf\nU_{\\text{ns}}\\equiv \\mathbf U_{\\text{n}} -\\mathbf U_{\\text{s}}\\ne 0$. We\nsuggest a simple analytic model for the cross correlation function\n$\\left\\langle \\mathbf u'_{\\text{n}}(\\mathbf r,t) \\cdot \\mathbf\nu'_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf r',t)\\right \\rangle$ and its dependence on\n$U_{\\text{ns}}$. We demonstrate that $\\mathbf u'_{\\text{n}}(\\mathbf r,t)$ and $\n\\mathbf u'_{\\text{s}}(\\mathbf r,t)$ are decoupled almost in the entire range of\nseparations $|\\mathbf r-\\mathbf r'|$ between the energy containing scale and\nintervortex distance.\n", "  The temperature dependent stability of the magnetic phases of FeRh were\ninvestigated by means of total energy calculations with magnetic disorder\ntreated within the uncompensated disordered local moment (uDLM) approach. In\naddition, Monte Carlo simulations based on the extended Heisenberg model have\nbeen performed, using exchange coupling parameters obtained rom first\nprinciples. The crucial role and interplay of two factors in the metamagnetic\ntransition in FeRh has been revealed, namely the dependence of the Fe-Fe\nexchange coupling parameters on the temperature-governed degree of magnetic\ndisorder in the system and the stabilizing nature of the induced magnetic\nmoment on Rh-sites. An important observation is the temperature dependence of\nthese two competing factors.\n", "  In this contribution talk we summarize the results of our ongoing project of\ndetailed analysis of the chemical content (chemical tagging) as a promising\npowerful method to provide clear constraints on the membership of FGK kinematic\ncandidates to stellar kinematic groups of different ages that can be used as an\nalternative or complementary to the methods that use kinematics, photometry or\nage indicators. This membership information is very important to better\nunderstand the star formation history in the solar neighborhood discerning\nbetween field-like stars (associated with dynamical resonances (bar) or spiral\nstructure) and real physical structures of coeval stars with a common origin\n(debris of star-forming aggregates in the disk). We have already applied the\nchemical tagging method to constrain the membership of FGK candidate stars to\nthe Hyades supercluster and the Ursa Major moving group and in this\ncontribution we present the preliminary results of our study of the Castor\nmoving group.\n", "  Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC8462852 was observed to undergo\nirregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux of up to $\\sim 20$\\%. The dipping\nactivity can last for between 5 and 80 days. We characterize the object with\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, radial\nvelocity measurements, high-resolution imaging, and Fourier analyses of the\nKepler light curve. We determine that KIC8462852 is a typical main-sequence F3\nV star that exhibits no significant IR excess, and has no very close\ninteracting companions. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain\nthe dipping events observed in the Kepler light curve. We confirm that the\ndipping signals in the data are not caused by any instrumental or data\nprocessing artifact, and thus are astrophysical in origin. We construct\nscenario-independent constraints on the size and location of a body in the\nsystem that is needed to reproduce the observations. We deliberate over several\nassorted stellar and circumstellar astrophysical scenarios, most of which have\nproblems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational\nconstraints on dust clumps in orbit around a normal main-sequence star, we\nconclude that the scenario most consistent with the data in hand is the passage\nof a family of exocomet or planetesimal fragments, all of which are associated\nwith a single previous break-up event, possibly caused by tidal disruption or\nthermal processing. The minimum total mass associated with these fragments\nlikely exceeds $10^{-6}$~\\mearth, corresponding to an original rocky body of\n$>100$~km in diameter. We discuss the necessity of future observations to help\ninterpret the system.\n", "  Every second greater than $10^{25}$ antineutrinos radiate to space from\nEarth, shining like a faint antineutrino star. Underground antineutrino\ndetectors have revealed the rapidly decaying fission products inside nuclear\nreactors, verified the long-lived radioactivity inside our planet, and informed\nsensitive experiments for probing fundamental physics. Mapping the anisotropic\nantineutrino flux and energy spectrum advance geoscience by defining the amount\nand distribution of radioactive power within Earth while critically evaluating\ncompeting compositional models of the planet.\n  We present the Antineutrino Global Map 2015 (AGM2015), an experimentally\ninformed model of Earth's surface antineutrino flux over the 0 to 11 MeV energy\nspectrum, along with an assessment of systematic errors. The open source\nAGM2015 provides fundamental predictions for experiments, assists in strategic\ndetector placement to determine neutrino mass hierarchy, and aids in\nidentifying undeclared nuclear reactors. We use cosmochemically and\nseismologically informed models of the radiogenic lithosphere/mantle combined\nwith the estimated antineutrino flux, as measured by KamLAND and Borexino, to\ndetermine the Earth's total antineutrino luminosity at $3.4^{+2.3}_{-2.2}\n\\times 10^{25} \\bar{\\nu}_e$. We find a dominant flux of geo-neutrinos, predict\nsub-equal crust and mantle contributions, with $\\sim1\\%$ of the total flux from\nman-made nuclear reactors.\n", "  We propose the addition of a new \"soft-collinear\" mode to soft collinear\neffective theory (SCET) below the usual soft scale to factorize and resum\nlogarithms of jet radii $R$ in jet cross sections. We consider exclusive 2-jet\ncross sections in $e^+e^-$ collisions with an energy veto $\\Lambda$ on\nadditional jets. The key observation is that there are actually two pairs of\nenergy scales whose ratio is $R$: the transverse momentum $QR$ of the energetic\nparticles inside jets and their total energy $Q$, and the transverse momentum\n$\\Lambda R$ of soft particles that are cut out of the jet cones and their\nenergy $\\Lambda$. The soft-collinear mode is necessary to factorize and resum\nlogarithms of the latter hierarchy. We show how this factorization occurs in\nthe jet thrust cross section for cone and $k_T$-type algorithms at\n$O(\\alpha_s)$ and using the thrust cone algorithm at $O(\\alpha_s^2)$. We\nidentify the presence of hard-collinear, in-jet soft, global (veto) soft, and\nsoft-collinear modes in the jet thrust cross section. We also observe here that\nthe in-jet soft modes measured with thrust are actually the \"csoft\" modes of\nthe theory SCET$_+$. We dub the new theory with both csoft and soft-collinear\nmodes SCET$_{++}$. We go on to explain the relation between the \"unmeasured\"\njet function appearing in total exclusive jet cross sections and the\nhard-collinear and csoft functions in measured jet thrust cross sections. We do\nnot resum logs that are non-global in origin, arising from the ratio of the\nscales of soft radiation whose thrust is measured at $Q\\tau/R$ and of the\nsoft-collinear radiation at $2\\Lambda R$. Their resummation would require the\nintroduction of additional operators beyond those we consider here. The steps\nwe outline here are a necessary part of summing logs of $R$ that are global in\nnature and have not been factorized and resummed beyond leading-log level\npreviously.\n", "  We use cosmological simulations to identify dark matter subhalo host\ncandidates of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy using the stellar kinematic\nproperties of Fornax. We consider cold dark matter (CDM), warm dark matter\n(WDM), and decaying dark matter (DDM) simulations for our models of structure\nformation. The subhalo candidates in CDM typically have smaller mass and higher\nconcentrations at z = 0 than the corresponding candidates in WDM and DDM. We\nexamine the formation histories of the ~ 100 Fornax candidate subhalos\nidentified in CDM simulations and, using approximate luminosity-mass\nrelationships for subhalos, we find two of these subhalos that are consistent\nwith both the Fornax luminosity and kinematics. These two subhalos have a peak\nmass over ten times larger than their z = 0 mass. We suggest that in CDM the\ndark matter halo hosting Fornax must have been severely stripped of mass and\nthat it had an infall time into the Milky Way of ~ 9 Gyr ago. In WDM, we find\nthat candidate subhalos consistent with the properties of Fornax have a similar\ninfall time and a similar degree of mass loss, while in DDM we find a later\ninfall time of ~ 3 - 4 Gyr ago and significantly less mass loss. We discuss\nthese results in the context of the Fornax star formation history, and show\nthat these predicted subhalo infall times can be linked to different star\nformation quenching mechanisms. This emphasizes the links between the\nproperties of the dark matter and the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution.\n", "  The discrepancy between the amplitudes of matter fluctuations inferred from\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) cluster number counts, the primary temperature, and the\npolarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measured by\nthe Planck satellite can be reconciled if the local universe is embedded in an\nunder-dense region as shown by Lee, 2014. Here using a simple void model\nassuming the open Friedmann-Robertson-Walker geometry and a Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo technique, we investigate how deep the local under-dense region needs to\nbe to resolve this discrepancy. Such local void, if exists, predicts the local\nHubble parameter value that is different from the global Hubble constant. We\nderive the posterior distribution of the local Hubble parameter from a joint\nfitting of the Planck CMB data and SZ cluster number counts assuming the simple\nvoid model. We show that the predicted local Hubble parameter value of $H_{\\rm\nloc}=70.1\\pm0.34~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ is in better agreement with direct\nlocal Hubble parameter measurements, indicating that the local void model may\nprovide a consistent solution to the cluster number counts and Hubble parameter\ndiscrepancies.\n", "  Using time-series photometry from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope\n(KELT) exoplanet survey, we are looking for eclipses of stars by their\nprotoplanetary disks, specifically in young stellar associations. To date, we\nhave discovered two previously unknown, large dimming events around the young\nstars RW Aurigae and V409 Tau. We attribute the dimming of RW Aurigae to an\noccultation by its tidally disrupted disk, with the disruption perhaps\nresulting from a recent flyby of its binary companion. Even with the dynamical\nenvironment of RW Aurigae, the distorted disk material remains very compact and\npresumably capable of forming planets. This system also shows that strong\nbinary interactions with disks can also influence planet and core composition\nby stirring up and mixing materials during planet formation. We interpret the\ndimming of V409 Tau to be due to a feature, possibly a warp or perturbation,\nlying at least 10 AU from the host star in its nearly edge-on circumstellar\ndisk.\n", "  Inclusive production of a quarkonium $\\eta_{c,b}$ in hadron collisions at low\ntransverse momentum can be used to extract various\nTransverse-Momentum-Dependent(TMD) gluon distributions of hadrons, provided the\nTMD factorization for the process holds. The factorization involving\nunpolarized TMD gluon distributions of unpolarized hadrons has been examined\nwith on-shell gluons at one-loop level. In this work we study the factorization\nat one-loop level with diagram approach in the most general case, where all TMD\ngluon distributions at leading twist are involved. We find that the\nfactorization holds and the perturbative effects are represented by one\nperturbative coefficient. Since the initial gluons from hadrons are off-shell\nin general, there exists the so-called super-leading region found recently. We\nfind that the contributions from this region can come from individual diagrams\nat one-loop level, but they are cancelled in the sum. Our factorized result for\nthe differential cross-section is explicitly gauge-invariant.\n", "  This year marks the hundredth anniversary of Einstein's 1915 landmark paper\n\"Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation\" in which the field equations of general\nrelativity were correctly formulated for the first time, thus rendering general\nrelativity a complete theory. Over the subsequent hundred years physicists and\nastronomers have struggled with uncovering the consequences and applications of\nthese equations. This contribution, which was written as an introduction to six\nchapters dealing with the connection between general relativity and cosmology\nthat will appear in the two-volume book \"One Hundred Years of General\nRelativity: From Genesis and Empirical Foundations to Gravitational Waves,\nCosmology and Quantum Gravity,\" endeavors to provide a historical overview of\nthe connection between general relativity and cosmology, two areas whose\ndevelopment has been closely intertwined.\n", "  We study the inflation scenarios, in the framework of superstring theory,\nwhere the inflaton is an axion producing the adiabatic curvature perturbations\nwhile there exists another light axion producing the isocurvature\nperturbations. We discuss how the non-trivial couplings among string axions can\ngenerically arise, and calculate the consequent cross-correlations between the\nadiabatic and isocurvature modes through concrete examples. Based on the Planck\nanalysis on the generally correlated isocurvature perturbations, we show that\nthere is a preference for the existence of the correlated isocurvature modes\nfor the axion monodromy inflation while the natural inflation disfavors such\nisocurvature modes.\n", "  We consider the electron-positron annihilation process into hadrons\n$R_{e^+e^-}$ up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_{s}^{3})$ and we adopt the smearing\nmethod suggest by Poggio, Quinn and Weinberg to confront the experimental data\nwith theory. As a theoretical model we use a QCD coupling constant frozen in\nthe low energy regime, where this coupling can be parameterised in terms of an\neffective dynamical gluon mass ($m_g$) which is determined through\nSchwinger-Dyson equations. In order to find the best fit between experimental\ndata and theory we perform a $\\chi^2$ study, that, within the uncertainties of\nthe approach, has a minimum value when $m_g/\\Lambda_{QCD}$ is in the range $1.2\n\\, - \\, 1.4$. These values are in agreement with other phenomenological\ndeterminations of this ratio and lead to an infrared effective charge\n$\\alpha_s(0) \\approx 0.7$. We comment how this effective charge may affect the\nglobal duality mass scale that indicates the frontier between perturbative and\nnon-perturbative physics.\n", "  We investigate the superconducting states that arise as a consequence of\nmesoscopic confinement and a multi-component order parameter in the\nGinzburg-Landau model for $p\\,$-wave superconductivity. Conventional vortices,\nbut also half-quantum vortices and skyrmions are found as the applied magnetic\nfield and the anisotropy parameters of the Fermi surface are varied. The\nsolutions are well differentiated by a topological charge that for skyrmions is\ngiven by the Hopf invariant and for vortices by the circulation of the\nsuperconducting velocity. We revealed several unique states combining vortices\nand skyrmions, their possible reconfiguration with varied magnetic field, as\nwell as the novel temporal and field-induced transitions between vortical and\nskyrmionic states.\n", "  Many time-dependent deformation processes at elevated temperatures produce\nsignificant concurrent microstructure changes that can alter the mechanical\nproperties in a profound manner. Such microstructure evolution is usually\nabsent in mesoscale deformation models and simulations. Here we present an\nintegrated full-field modeling scheme that couples the mechanical response with\nthe underlying microstructure evolution. As a first demonstration, we integrate\na fast Fourier transform-based elasto-viscoplastic (FFT-EVP) model with a\nphase-field (PF) recrystallization model, and carry out three-dimensional (3D)\nsimulations of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in polycrystalline copper. A\nphysics-based coupling between FFT-EVP and PF is achieved by (1) adopting a\ndislocation-based constitutive model in FFT-EVP, which allows the predicted\ndislocation density distribution to be converted to a stored energy\ndistribution and passed to PF, and (2) implementing a stochastic nucleation\nmodel for DRX. Calibrated with the experimental DRX stress-strain curves, the\nintegrated model is able to deliver full-field mechanical and microstructural\ninformation, from which quantitative description and analysis of DRX can be\nachieved. It is suggested that the initiation of DRX occurs significantly\nearlier than previous predictions, due to heterogeneous deformation. DRX grains\nare revealed to form at both grain boundaries and junctions (e.g., quadruple\njunctions) and tend to maintain a triple line with old grains during the\ngrowth. The resulted stress redistribution is found to have a profound\ninfluence on the subsequent dislocation evolution and the softening.\n", "  Our goal is to relate the photometric and spectroscopic variability of\nclassical T Tauri stars, of the star-forming cluster NGC 2264, to the physical\nprocesses acting in the stellar and circumstellar environment, within a few\nstellar radii from the star. NGC 2264 was the target of a multiwavelength\nobservational campaign with CoRoT, MOST, Spitzer, and Chandra satellites and\nobservations from the ground. We classified the CoRoT light curves of accreting\nsystems according to their morphology and compared our classification to\nseveral accretion diagnostics and disk parameters. The morphology of the CoRoT\nlight curve reflects the evolution of the accretion process and of the inner\ndisk region. Accretion burst stars present high mass-accretion rates and\noptically thick inner disks. AA Tau-like systems, whose light curves are\ndominated by circumstellar dust obscuration, show intermediate mass-accretion\nrates and are located in the transition of thick to anemic disks. Classical T\nTauri stars with spot-like light curves correspond mostly to systems with a low\nmass-accretion rate and low mid-IR excess. About 30% of the classical T Tauri\nstars observed in the 2008 and 2011 CoRoT runs changed their light-curve\nmorphology. Transitions from AA Tau-like and spot-like to aperiodic light\ncurves and vice versa were common. The analysis of the $H\\alpha$ emission line\nvariability of 58 accreting stars showed that 8 presented a periodicity that in\na few cases was coincident with the photometric period. The blue and red wings\nof the $H\\alpha$ line profiles often do not correlate with each other,\nindicating that they are strongly influenced by different physical processes.\nAccreting stars have a dynamic stellar and circumstellar environment that can\nbe explained by magnetospheric accretion and outflow models, including\nvariations from stable to unstable accretion regimes on timescales of a few\nyears\n", "  Inspired by the recent diboson excess observed at the LHC and possible\ninterpretation within a TeV-scale Left-Right symmetric framework, we explore\nits implications for low-energy experiments searching for lepton number and\nflavor violation. Assuming a simple Type-II seesaw mechanism for neutrino\nmasses, we show that for the right-handed (RH) gauge boson mass and coupling\nvalues required to explain the LHC anomalies, the RH contribution to the lepton\nnumber violating process of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$)\nis already constrained by current experiments for relatively low-mass (MeV-GeV)\nRH neutrinos. The future ton-scale $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments could probe\nmost of the remaining parameter space, irrespective of the neutrino mass\nhierarchy and uncertainties in the oscillation parameters and nuclear matrix\nelements. On the other hand, the RH contribution to the lepton flavor violating\nprocess of $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ is constrained for relatively heavier (TeV) RH\nneutrinos, thus providing a complementary probe of the model. Finally, a\nmeasurement of the absolute light neutrino mass scale from future precision\ncosmology could make this scenario completely testable.\n", "  The Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem is applied to the solutions of Einstein's\nequations and to cosmology. Three fundamental requirements of the theorem: the\nuse of analytic series; the existence of the boundary surfaces; and the setting\nof the independent initial data are revised, using methods of geometric\nanalysis. It is shown that during its relativistic phase, the standard model of\nthe universe is governed by Einstein's gravitation described as a massless\nspin-2 field, but it is necessarily complemented by massive spin-2 field, which\nresponds for the dark sector of the universe. On the other hand, at the\ninflationary phase, the exponential growth of the volume of the universe is\nshown to be consistent with a thermal, non-relativistic expansion. These two\nphases are separated by the last inflationary surface.\n", "  The nature of the superconducting transition in highly underdoped thick films\nof La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ ($x=0.07$ and 0.08) has been investigated using the\nin-plane transport measurements. The contribution of superconducting\nfluctuations to the conductivity in zero magnetic field, or paraconductivity,\nwas determined from the magnetoresistance measured in fields applied\nperpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. Both the temperature dependence of the\nparaconductivity above the transition and the nonlinear current-voltage ($I-V$)\ncharacteristics measured across it, exhibit the main signatures of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The quantitative comparison\nof the superfluid stiffness, extracted from the $I-V$ data, with the\nrenormalization-group results for the BKT theory, reveals a large value of the\nvortex-core energy. This finding is confirmed by the analysis of the\nparaconductivity obtained using different methods. The results strongly suggest\nthat the characteristic energy scale controlling the BKT behavior in this\nlayered system corresponds to the superfluid stiffness of a few layers.\n", "  Main sequence stars hosting extreme quantities of inner planetary system\ndebris are likely experiencing transient dust production events. The nature of\nthese events, if they can be unambiguously attributed to a single process, can\npotentially inform us on the formation and/or early evolution of rocky\nEarth-like planets. In this contribution I examine some of the dustiest main\nsequence stars known and three processes that may be capable of reproducing\ntheir observed properties. Through this activity I also make an estimate for\nthe likelihood of an A-type star to have an asteroid belt-like planetesimal\npopulation.\n", "  We consider an extension of WDW minisuperpace cosmology with additional\ninteraction terms that preserve the linear structure of the theory. General\nperturbative methods are developed and applied to known semiclassical solutions\nfor a closed Universe filled with a massless scalar. The exact Feynman\npropagator of the free theory is derived by means of a conformal transformation\nin minisuperspace. As an example, a stochastic interaction term is considered\nand first order perturbative corrections are computed. It is argued that such\nan interaction can be used to describe the interaction of the cosmological\nbackground with the microscopic d.o.f. of the gravitational field. A\nHelmoltz-like equation is considered for the case of interactions that do not\ndepend on the internal time and the corresponding Green's kernel is obtained\nexactly.The possibility of linking this approach to fundamental theories of\nQuantum Gravity is investigated.\n", "  The hadronic production of a Higgs boson (H) in association with b jets will\nplay an important role in investigating the Higgs-boson couplings to Standard\nModel particles during Run II of the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and could in\nparticular reveal the presence of anomalies in the assumed hierarchy of Yukawa\ncouplings to the third-generation quarks. A very high degree of accuracy in the\ntheoretical description of this process is crucial to implement the rich\nphysics program that could lead to either direct or indirect evidence of new\nphysics from Higgs-boson measurements. Aiming for accuracy in the theoretical\nmodeling of H+b-jet production, we have interfaced the analytic\nNext-to-Leading-Order QCD calculation of H-bottom-antibottom production with\nparton-shower Monte Carlo event generators in the POWHEG BOX framework. In this\npaper we describe the most relevant aspects of the implementation and present\nresults for the production of H+1 b jet, H+2 b jets, and $H$ with no tagged b\njets, in the form of kinematic distributions of the Higgs boson, of the b jets,\nand of the non-b jets, at the 13 TeV Large Hadron Collider. The corresponding\ncode is part of the public release of the POWHEG BOX.\n", "  Proximity effect is used to generate effective topological superconductor by\nplacing strong spin orbit interacting metals with superconducting materials,\naiming to produce Majorana zero modes useful for topologically protected\nquantum computations. In recent experiments high $T_c$ material\n$\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Sr}_2\\text{CaCu}_2\\text{O}_{8+\\delta}$ is put in contact with\na few quintuple layer thick $\\text{Bi}_2\\text{Se}_3$, and conflicting\nexperimental results are reported. We use standard mean field approach to study\nthis heterostructure, and find it is unlikely to have large proximity induced\nsuperconducting gap. The claimed observed s-wave gap might not be purely\nsuperconducting coherence gap despite its seemingly correct temperature\ndependence. Further study on the proximity induced bulk coherence gap and the\nband structure at the interface should shed light on this issue.\n", "  We study the algebraic structure of an integrable Hubbard-Shastry type\nlattice model associated with the centrally extended su(2|2) superalgebra. This\nsuperalgebra underlies Beisert's AdS/CFT worldsheet R-matrix and Shastry's\nR-matrix. The considered model specializes to the one-dimensional Hubbard model\nin a certain limit. We demonstrate that Yangian symmetries of the R-matrix\nspecialize to the Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard model found by Korepin and\nUglov. Moreover, we show that the Hubbard model Hamiltonian has an algebraic\ninterpretation as the so-called secret symmetry. We also discuss Yangian\nsymmetries of the A and B models introduced by Frolov and Quinn.\n", "  The construction of exponentially localized Wannier functions for a set of\nbands requires a choice of Bloch-like functions that span the space of the\nbands in question, and are smooth and periodic functions of k in the entire\nBrillouin zone. For bands with nontrivial topology, such smooth Bloch functions\ncan only be chosen such that they do not respect the symmetries that protect\nthe topology. This symmetry breaking is a necessary, but not sufficient\ncondition for smoothness, and, in general, finding smooth Bloch functions for\ntopological bands is a complicated task. We present a generic technique for\nfinding smooth Bloch functions and constructing exponentially localized Wannier\nfunctions in the presence of nontrivial topology, given that the net Chern\nnumber of the bands in question vanishes. The technique is verified against\nknown results in the Kane-Mele model. It is then applied to the topological\ninsulator Bi2Se3, where the topological state is protected by two symmetries:\ntime reversal and inversion. The resultant exponentially localized Wannier\nfunctions break both these symmetries. Finally, we illustrate how the\ncalculation of the Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric response is facilitated\nby the proposed smooth gauge construction.\n", "  LOFAR offers the unique capability of observing pulsars across the 10-240 MHz\nfrequency range with a fractional bandwidth of roughly 50%. This spectral range\nis well-suited for studying the frequency evolution of pulse profile morphology\ncaused by both intrinsic and extrinsic effects: such as changing emission\naltitude in the pulsar magnetosphere or scatter broadening by the interstellar\nmedium, respectively. The magnitude of most of these effects increases rapidly\ntowards low frequencies. LOFAR can thus address a number of open questions\nabout the nature of radio pulsar emission and its propagation through the\ninterstellar medium. We present the average pulse profiles of 100 pulsars\nobserved in the two LOFAR frequency bands: High Band (120-167 MHz, 100\nprofiles) and Low Band (15-62 MHz, 26 profiles). We compare them with\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) and Lovell Telescope observations\nat higher frequencies (350 and1400 MHz) in order to study the profile\nevolution. The profiles are aligned in absolute phase by folding with a new set\nof timing solutions from the Lovell Telescope, which we present along with\nprecise dispersion measures obtained with LOFAR. We find that the profile\nevolution with decreasing radio frequency does not follow a specific trend but,\ndepending on the geometry of the pulsar, new components can enter into, or be\nhidden from, view. Nonetheless, in general our observations confirm the\nwidening of pulsar profiles at low frequencies, as expected from\nradius-to-frequency mapping or birefringence theories. We offer this catalog of\nlow-frequency pulsar profiles in a user friendly way via the EPN Database of\nPulsar Profiles (http://www.epta.eu.org/epndb/).\n", "  We present direct spectroscopic modeling of 11 high-S/N observed spectra of\nthe Type Ia SN 2010kg, taken between -10 and +5 days with respect to B-maximum.\nThe synthetic spectra, calculated with the SYN++ code, span the range between\n4100 and 8500 \\r{A}. Our results are in good agreement with previous findings\nfor other Type Ia SNe. Most of the spectral features are formed at or close to\nthe photosphere, but some ions, like Fe II and Mg II, also form features at\n~2000 - 5000 km s$^{-1}$ above the photosphere. The well-known high-velocity\nfeatures of the Ca II IR-triplet as well as Si II $\\lambda$6355 are also\ndetected.\n  The single absorption feature at ~4400 \\r{A}, which usually has been\nidentified as due to Si III, is poorly fit with Si III in SN 2010kg. We find\nthat the fit can be improved by assuming that this feature is due to either C\nIII or O II, located in the outermost part of the ejecta, ~4000 - 5000 km\ns$^{-1}$ above the photosphere. Since the presence of C III is unlikely,\nbecause of the lack of the necessary excitation/ionization conditions in the\nouter ejecta, we identify this feature as due to O II. The simultaneous\npresence of O I and O II is in good agreement with the optical depth\ncalculations and the temperature distribution in the ejecta of SN 2010kg. This\ncould be the first identification of singly ionized oxygen in a Type Ia SN\natmosphere.\n", "  High quality chromium (Cr) doped three-dimensional topological insulator (TI)\nSb2Te3 films are grown via molecular beam epitaxy on heat-treated insulating\nSrTiO3(111) substrates. We report that the Dirac surface states are insensitive\nto Cr doping, and a perfect robust long-range ferromagnetic order is unveiled\nin epitaxial Sb2-xCrxTe3 films. The anomalous Hall effect is modulated by\napplying a bottom gate, contrary to the ferromagnetism in conventional diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors (DMSs), here the coercivity field is not significantly\nchanged with decreasing carrier density. Carrier-independent ferromagnetism\nheralds Sb2-xCrxTe3 films as the base candidate TI material to realize the\nquantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. These results also indicate the potential\nof controlling anomalous Hall voltage in future TI-based magneto-electronics\nand spintronics.\n", "  We develop a simple yet comprehensive method to distinguish the underlying\ndrivers of galaxy quenching, using the clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing of\nred and blue galaxies in SDSS. Building on the iHOD framework developed by Zu &\nMandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a \"halo\" quenching\nmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in\nboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a \"hybrid\" quenching model in which the\nquenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite\nquenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo\nmass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct\nweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which\nquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which\ngalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the\nobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals. We find similar critical halo\nmasses responsible for the quenching of centrals and satellites\n(~$1.5\\times10^{12} M\\odot/h^2$), hinting at a uniform quenching mechanism for\nboth, e.g., the virial shock-heating of infalling gas. The success of the iHOD\nhalo quenching model provides strong evidence that the physical mechanism that\nquenches star formation in galaxies is tied principally to the masses of their\ndark matter halos rather than the properties of their stellar components.\n", "  In this paper, we explore two different ways of implementing quantum effects\nin a classical structure. The first one is through an external field. The other\none is modifying the classical conservation laws. In both cases, the\nconsequences for the description of the evolution of the universe are\ndiscussed.\n", "  What is the size of the atomic nucleus? This deceivably simple question is\ndifficult to answer. While the electric charge distributions in atomic nuclei\nwere measured accurately already half a century ago, our knowledge of the\ndistribution of neutrons is still deficient. In addition to constraining the\nsize of atomic nuclei, the neutron distribution also impacts the number of\nnuclei that can exist and the size of neutron stars. We present an ab initio\ncalculation of the neutron distribution of the neutron-rich nucleus $^{48}$Ca.\nWe show that the neutron skin (difference between radii of neutron and proton\ndistributions) is significantly smaller than previously thought. We also make\npredictions for the electric dipole polarizability and the weak form factor;\nboth quantities are currently targeted by precision measurements. Based on ab\ninitio results for $^{48}$Ca, we provide a constraint on the size of a neutron\nstar.\n", "  We are conducting a survey for pulsars and transients using the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The GMRT High Resolution Southern Sky (GHRSS)\nsurvey is an off-Galactic-plane (|b|>5) survey in the declination range -40 deg\nto -54 deg at 322 MHz. With the high time (up to 30.72 micro-sec) and frequency\n(up to 0.016275 MHz) resolution observing modes, the 5-sigma detection limit is\n0.5 mJy for a 2 ms pulsar with 10% duty cycle at 322 MHz. Total GHRSS sky\ncoverage of 2866 square-deg, will result from 1953 pointing, each covering 1.8\nsquare-deg. The 10-sigma detection limit for a 5 milli-sec transient burst is\n1.6 Jy for the GHRSS survey. In addition, the GHRSS survey can reveal transient\nevents like rotating radio transients or fast radio bursts. With 35% of the\nsurvey completed (i.e. 1000 square-deg), we report the discovery of 10 pulsars,\none of which is a millisecond pulsar (MSP), one of the highest pulsar per\nsquare degree discovery rates for any off-Galactic plane survey. We re-detected\n23 known in-beam pulsars. Utilising the imaging capability of the GMRT we also\nlocalised 4 of the GHRSS pulsars (including the MSP) in the gated image plane\nwithin +/- 10 arc-second. We demonstrated rapid convergence in pulsar timing\nwith a more precise position than is possible with single dish discoveries. We\nalso exhibited that we can localise the brightest transient sources with\nsimultaneously obtained lower time resolution imaging data, demonstrating a\ntechnique that may have application in the SKA.\n", "  We investigate the specific heat at constant volume $C_V$ in the BCS\n(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover regime\nof an ultracold Fermi gas above the superfluid phase transition temperature\n$T_{\\rm c}$. Within the framework of the strong-coupling theory developed by\nNozi\\`eres and Schmitt-Rink, we show that this thermodynamic quantity is\nsensitive to the stability of preformed Cooper pairs. That is, while\n$C_V(T\\gesim T_{\\rm c})$ in the unitary regime is remarkably enhanced by {\\it\nmetastable} preformed Cooper pairs or pairing fluctuations, it is well\ndescribed by that of an ideal Bose gas of long-lived {\\it stable} molecules in\nthe strong-coupling BEC regime. Using these results, we identify the region\nwhere the system may be viewed as an almost ideal Bose gas of stable pairs, as\nwell as the pseudogap regime where the system is dominated by metastable\npreformed Cooper pairs, in the phase diagram of an ultracold Fermi gas with\nrespect to the strength of a pairing interaction and the temperature. We also\nshow that the calculated specific heat agrees with the recent experiment on a\n$^6$Li unitary Fermi gas. Since the formation of preformed Cooper pairs is a\ncrucial key in the BCS-BEC crossover phenomenon, our results would be helpful\nin considering how fluctuating preformed Cooper pairs appear in a Fermi gas, to\neventually become stable, as one passes through the BCS-BEC crossover region.\n", "  We report the discovery of two additional planetary companions to WASP-41 and\nWASP-47. WASP-41 c is a planet of minimum mass 3.18 $\\pm$ 0.20 M$_{\\rm Jup}$\nand eccentricity 0.29 $\\pm$ 0.02, and it orbits in 421 $\\pm$ 2 days. WASP-47 c\nis a planet of minimum mass 1.24 $\\pm$ 0.22 M$_{\\rm Jup}$ and eccentricity 0.13\n$\\pm$ 0.10, and it orbits in 572 $\\pm$ 7 days. Unlike most of the planetary\nsystems that include a hot Jupiter, these two systems with a hot Jupiter have a\nlong-period planet located at only $\\sim$1 au from their host star. WASP-41 is\na rather young star known to be chromospherically active. To differentiate its\nmagnetic cycle from the radial velocity effect induced by the second planet, we\nused the emission in the H$\\alpha$ line and find this indicator well suited to\ndetecting the stellar activity pattern and the magnetic cycle. The analysis of\nthe Rossiter-McLaughlin effect induced by WASP-41 b suggests that the planet\ncould be misaligned, though an aligned orbit cannot be excluded. WASP-47 has\nrecently been found to host two additional transiting super Earths. With such\nan unprecedented architecture, the WASP-47 system will be very important for\nunderstanding planetary migration.\n", "  Fe3PO4O3 forms a non-centrosymmetric lattice structure (space group R3m)\ncomprising triangular motifs of Fe^{3+} coupled by strong antiferromagnetic\ninteractions (|\\Theta_{CW}| > 900 K). Neutron diffraction from polycrystalline\nsamples shows that strong frustration eventually gives way to an ordered\nhelical incommensurate structure below T_N = 163 K, with the helical axis in\nthe hexagonal ab plane and a modulation length of ~ 86 \\AA. The magnetic\nstructure consists of an unusual needle-like correlation volume that extends\npast 900 \\AA along the hexagonal c-axis but is limited to ~ 70 \\AA in the ab\nplane, despite the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic sublattice\ntopology. The small in-plane correlation length, which persists to at least T =\nT_N/40, indicates a robust blocking of long-range order of the helical magnetic\nstructure, and therefore stable domain walls, or other defect spin textures,\nmust be abundant in Fe3PO7. Temperature dependent neutron powder diffraction\nreveals small negative thermal expansion below T_N. No change in lattice\nsymmetry is observed on cooling through T_N, as revealed by high resolution\nsynchrotron X-ray diffraction. The previously reported reduced moment of the\nFe^{3+} ions (S=5/2), \\mu ~ 4.2 \\mu_B, is confirmed here through magnetization\nstudies of a magnetically diluted solid solution series of compounds,\nFe3-xGaxPO4O3, and is consistent with the refined magnetic moment from neutron\ndiffraction 4.14(2) \\mu_B. We attribute the reduced moment to a modified spin\ndensity distribution arising from ligand charge transfer in this insulating\noxide.\n", "  [Abridged] We present the results of an extensive Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) imaging study of ~100 Swift long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs)\nspanning 0.03 < z < 9.4 using relative astrometry from afterglow observations\nto locate the bursts within their host galaxies. We measure the distribution of\nLGRB offsets from their host centers, as well as their relation to the\nunderlying host light distribution. We find that the host-normalized offsets\n(R/R_h) of LGRBs are more centrally concentrated than expected for an\nexponential disk profile, with a median of 0.67, and in particular they are\nmore concentrated than the underlying surface brightness profiles of their host\ngalaxies. The distribution of offsets is inconsistent with the distribution for\nType II supernovae (SNe) but consistent with the distribution for Type Ib/c\nSNe. The fractional flux distribution, with a median of 0.75, indicates that\nLGRBs prefer some of the brightest locations in their host galaxies but are not\nas strongly correlated as previous studies indicated. More importantly, we find\na clear correlation between the offset and fractional flux, where bursts at\nR/R_h < 0.5 exclusively occur at fractional fluxes > 0.6 while bursts at R/R_h\n> 0.5 uniformly trace the light of their hosts. This indicates that the spatial\ncorrelation of LGRB locations with bright star forming regions seen in the full\nsample is dominated by the contribution from bursts at small offset and that\nLGRBs in the outer parts of galaxies show no preference for unusually bright\nstar forming regions. We conclude that LGRBs strongly prefer the bright, inner\nregions of their hosts indicating that the star formation taking place there is\nmore favorable for LGRB progenitor production. This indicates that another\nenvironmental factor beyond metallicity, such as binary interactions or IMF\ndifferences, may be operating in the central regions of LGRB hosts.\n", "  We present a class of models in the framework of gauge mediation\nsupersymmetry breaking where the standard model is supplemented by additional\nU(1) symmetry which acts only on the third generation fermions. The messenger\nfields carry non-trivial U(1) charge and are vector-like particles under this\nsymmetry. This leads to additional contribution to the soft supersymmetry\nbreaking mass terms for the third generation squarks and sleptons. In this\nframework we show that the muon g-2 anomaly, the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson\nmass and the detected relic dark matter abundance (gravitino in our case) can\nbe simultaneously accommodated. The resolution of the muon g-2 anomaly, in\nparticular, yields the result that the first two generation squark masses, as\nwell the gluino mass, should be <~ 2.5 TeV, which will be tested at LHC14.\n", "  A search is presented for a singly produced excited bottom quark (b*)\ndecaying to a top quark and a W boson in the all-hadronic, lepton + jets, and\ndilepton final states in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV recorded\nby the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. Data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns are used. No significant excess of events\nis observed with respect to standard model expectations. We set limits at 95%\nconfidence on the product of the b* quark production cross section and its\nbranching fraction to tW. The cross section limits are interpreted for\nscenarios including left-handed, right-handed, and vector-like couplings of the\nb* quark and are presented in the two-dimensional coupling plane based on the\nproduction and decay coupling constants. The masses of the left-handed,\nright-handed, and vector-like b* quark states are excluded at 95% confidence\nbelow 1390, 1430, and 1530 GeV, respectively, for benchmark couplings. This\nanalysis gives the most stringent limits on the mass of the b* quark to date.\n", "  Disks of bodies orbiting a much more massive central object are extremely\ncommon in astrophysics. When the orbits comprising such disks are eccentric, we\nshow they are susceptible to a new dynamical instability. Gravitational forces\nbetween bodies in the disk drive exponential growth of their orbital\ninclinations and clustering in their angles of pericenter, expanding an\ninitially thin disk into a conical shape by giving each orbit an identical\n'tilt' with respect to the disk plane. This new instability dynamically\nproduces the unusual distribution of orbits observed for minor planets beyond\nNeptune, suggesting that the instability has shaped the outer Solar System. It\nalso implies a large initial disk mass (1-10 Earth masses) of scattered bodies\nat hundreds of AU; we predict increasing numbers of detections of minor planets\nclustered in their angles of pericenter with high inclinations.\n", "  We introduce a family of layer to layer transfer matrices in a\nthree-dimensional (3D) lattice model which can be viewed as partition functions\nof the $q$-oscillator valued six-vertex model on $m \\times n$ square lattice.\nBy invoking the tetrahedron equation we establish their commutativity and\nbilinear relations mixing various boundary conditions. At $q=0$ and $m=n$, they\nultimately yield a new proof of the steady state formula for the $n$-species\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) obtained recently by the\nauthors, revealing the 3D integrability in the matrix product construction.\n", "  A functional renormalization group approach to $d$-dimensional,\n$N$-component, non-collinear magnets is performed using various truncations of\nthe effective action relevant to study their long distance behavior. With help\nof these truncations we study the existence of a stable fixed point for\ndimensions between $d= 2.8$ and $d=4$ for various values of $N$ focusing on the\ncritical value $N_c(d)$ that, for a given dimension $d$, separates a first\norder region for $N<N_c(d)$ from a second order region for $N>N_c(d)$. Our\napproach concludes to the absence of stable fixed point in the physical -\n$N=2,3$ and $d=3$ - cases, in agreement with $\\epsilon=4-d$-expansion and in\ncontradiction with previous perturbative approaches performed at fixed\ndimension and with recent approaches based on conformal bootstrap program.\n", "  We investigate the effect of time-dependent cyclic-adiabatic driving on the\ncharge transport in quantum junction. We propose a nonequilibrium Greens\nfunction formalism to study statistics of the charge pumped (at zero bias)\nthrough the junction. The formulation is used to demonstrate charge pumping in\na single electronic level coupled to two (electronic) reservoirs with time\ndependent couplings. Analytical expression for the average pumped current for a\ngeneral cyclic driving is derived. It is found that for zero bias, for a\ncertain class of driving, the Berry phase contributes only to the odd\ncumulants. To contrast, a quantum master equation formulation does not show\nBerry-phase effect at all.\n", "  The photon spectrum in macrocoherent atomic de-excitation via radiative\nemission of neutrino pairs (RENP) has been proposed as a sensitive probe of the\nneutrino mass spectrum, capable of competing with conventional neutrino\nexperiments. In this paper we revisit this intriguing technique in order to\nquantify the requirements for statistical determination of some of the\nproperties of the neutrino spectrum, in particular the neutrino mass scale and\nthe mass ordering. Our results are sobering. We find that, even under ideal\nconditions, the determination of neutrino parameters needs experimental live\ntimes of the order of days to years for several laser frequencies, assuming a\ntarget of volume of order 100 cm3 containing about 10^21 atoms per cubic\ncentimeter in a totally coherent state with maximum value of the electric field\nin the target. Such conditions seem to be, as of today, way beyond the reach of\nour current technology.\n", "  Higher order time-correlators of spontaneous spin fluctuations reveal the\ninformation about spin interactions. We argue that in a broad class of spin\nsystems one can justify a phenomenological approach to explore such\ncorrelators. Thus, we predict that the 3rd and 4th order spin cumulants are\ndescribed by a universal function that can be parametrized by a small set of\nparameters. We show that the fluctuation theorem constrains this function so\nthat such correlators are fully determined by lowest nonlinear corrections to\nthe free energy and the mean and variance of microscopic spin currents. We also\nprovide an example of microscopic calculations for conduction electrons.\n", "  We have used the Submillimeter Array to image, at ~1\" resolution, C2H(3-2)\nemission from the molecule-rich circumstellar disks orbiting the nearby,\nclassical T Tauri star systems TW Hya and V4046 Sgr. The SMA imaging reveals\nthat the C2H emission exhibits a ring-like morphology within each disk, the\ninner hole radius of the C2H ring within the V4046 Sgr disk (~70 AU) is\nsomewhat larger than than of its counterpart within the TW Hya disk (~45 AU).\nWe suggest that, in each case, the C2H emission likely traces irradiation of\nthe tenuous surface layers of the outer disks by high-energy photons from the\ncentral stars.\n", "  Beginning with the enigmatic (and now emblematic) TW Hya, the scutiny of\nindividual stars and star-disk systems has both motivated and benefitted from\nthe identification of nearby young moving groups (NYMGs). I briefly outline the\nemergence of this relatively new subfield of astronomy over the past two\ndecades, and offer a few examples illustrating how the study of NYMGs and their\nmembers enables unique investigations of pre-main sequence stellar evolution,\nevolved protoplanetary disks, and young exoplanets.\n", "  Starting from some relevant facts concerning the behaviour of the universe\nover large scale and time span, the analogy between the geometric approach of\nGeneral Relativ- ity and the classical description of an elastic strained\nmaterial continuum is discussed. Extending the elastic deformation approach to\nfour dimensions it is shown that the accelerated expansion of the universe is\nrecovered. The strain field of space-time repro- duces properties similar to\nthe ones ascribed to the dark energy currently called in to explain the\naccelerated expansion. The strain field in the primordial universe behaves as\nradiation, but asymptotically it reproduces the cosmological constant.\nSubjecting the theory to a number of cosmological tests confirms the soundness\nof the approach and gives an optimal value for the one parameter of the model,\ni.e. the bulk modulus of the space-time continuum. Finally various aspects of\nthe Strained State Cosmology (SSC) are discussed and contrasted with some\nnon-linear massive gravity theories. The possible role of structure topological\ndefects is also mentioned. The conclusion is that SSC is at least as good as\nthe LCDM standard cosmology, giving a more intuitive interpretation of the\nphysical nature of the phenomena.\n", "  Circumstellar disks are the sites of planet formation, and the very high\nincidence of extrasolar planets implies that most of them actually form\nplanetary systems. Studying the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks\ncan thus place important constraints on the conditions, timescales, and\nmechanisms associated with the planet formation process. In this review, we\ndiscuss observational results from infrared and submillimeter wavelength\nstudies. We review disk lifetimes, transition objects, disk demographics, and\nhighlight a few remarkable results from ALMA Early Science observations. We\nfinish with a brief discussion of ALMA's potential to transform the field in\nnear future.\n", "  Using semi-empirical isochrones, we find the age of the Taurus star-forming\nregion to be 3-4 Myr. Comparing the disc fraction in Taurus to young massive\nclusters suggests discs survive longer in this low density environment. We also\npresent a method of photometrically de-reddening young stars using $iZJH$ data.\n", "  Debris disks are intimately linked to planetary system evolution since the\nrocky material surrounding the host stars is due to secondary generation from\nthe collisions of planetesimals. With the conclusion and lack of future large\nscale infrared excess survey missions, it is time to summarize the history of\nusing excess emission in the infrared as a tracer of debris. We have compiled a\ncatalog of infrared excess stars from peer reviewed articles and performed an\nextensive search for new debris disks by cross correlating the Tycho 2 and\nAllWISE catalogs. This study will examine each debris disk stars parameters\nobtained through high resolution spectroscopy at various facilities. We will\nmaintain a webpage devoted to these infrared excess sources and provide various\nresources related to our catalog creation, SED fitting, and data reduction.\n", "  X-ray surveys are well suited to detect, identify and study young stars based\non their high levels of magnetic activity and thus X-ray brightness. The\neROSITA instrument onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) satellite will\nperform an X-ray all-sky survey that surpasses existing data by a sensitivity\nincrease of more than an order of magnitude. The 4 yr survey is expected to\ndetect more than half a million stars and stellar systems in X-rays.\n", "  Using data from the WISE All-Sky Survey, we have found >100 new infrared\nexcess sources around main-sequence Hipparcos stars within 75pc. Our empirical\ncalibration of WISE photospheric colors and removal of non-trivial\nfalse-positive sources are responsible for the high confidence (>99.5%) of\ndetections, while our corrections to saturated W1 (3.4um) and W2 (4.6um)\nphotometry have for the first time allowed us to search for new infrared excess\nsources around bright field stars in WISE. The careful calibration and\nfiltering of the WISE data have allowed us to probe excess fluxes down to\nroughly 8% of the photospheric emission at 22um around saturated stars in WISE.\nWe expect that the increased sensitivity of our survey will not only aid in\nunderstanding the evolution of debris disks, but will also benefit future\nstudies using WISE.\n", "  Surface rotation rates of young solar-type stars display drastic changes at\nthe end of the pre-main sequence through the early main sequence. This may\ntrigger corresponding changes in the magnetic dynamos operating in these stars,\nwhich ought to be observable in their surface magnetic fields. We present here\nthe first results of an observational effort aimed at characterizing the\nevolution of stellar magnetic fields through this critical phase. We observed\nstars from open clusters and associations, which range from 20 to 600 Myr, and\nused Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize their complex magnetic fields. We\nfind a clear trend towards weaker magnetic fields for older ages, as well as a\ntight correlation between magnetic field strength and Rossby number over this\nage range. Comparing to results for younger T Tauri stars, we observe a very\nsignificant change in magnetic strength and geometry, as the radiative core\ndevelops during the late pre-main sequence.\n", "  We study the cosmic censorship of dynamical $p$-brane systems in a\n$D$-dimensional background. This is the generalization of the analysis in the\nEinstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, which was discussed by Horne and Horowitz\n[Phys. Rev. D 48, R5457 (1993)]. We show that a timelike curvature singularity\ngenerically appears from an asymptotic region in the time evolution of the\n$p$-brane solution. Since we can set regular and smooth initial data in a\ndynamical M5-brane system in 11-dimensional supergravity, this implies a\nviolation of cosmic censorship.\n", "  We perform a Wang-Landau Monte Carlo simulation of a Cu0.5Zn0.5\norder-disorder transition using 250 atoms and pairwise atom swaps inside a 5 x\n5 x 5 BCC supercell. Each time step uses energies calculated from density\nfunctional theory (DFT) via the all-electron Korringa-Kohn- Rostoker method and\nself-consistent potentials. Here we find CuZn undergoes a transition from a\ndisordered A2 to an ordered B2 structure, as observed in experiment. Our\ncalculated transition temperature is near 870 K, comparing favorably to the\nknown experimental peak at 750 K. We also plot the entropy, temperature,\nspecific-heat, and short-range order as a function of internal energy.\n", "  Using a fundamental discrete symmetry, $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, we construct a\ntwo-axion model with the QCD axion solving the strong-$CP$ problem, and an\nultralight axion (ULA) with $m_{\\rm ULA}\\approx 10^{-22}\\text{ eV}$ providing\nthe dominant form of dark matter (DM). The ULA is light enough to be detectable\nin cosmology from its imprints on structure formation, and may resolve the\nsmall-scale problems of cold DM. The necessary relative DM abundances occur\nwithout fine tuning in constructions with decay constants $f_{\\rm ULA}\\sim\n10^{17}\\text{ GeV}$, and $f_{\\rm QCD}\\sim 10^{11}\\text{ GeV}$. An example model\nachieving this has $N=24$, and we construct a range of other possibilities. We\ncompute the ULA couplings to the Standard Model, and discuss prospects for\ndirect detection. The QCD axion may be detectable in standard experiments\nthrough the $\\vec{E}\\cdot\\vec{B}$ and $G\\tilde{G}$ couplings. In the simplest\nmodels, however, the ULA has identically zero coupling to both $G\\tilde{G}$ of\nQCD and $\\vec{E}\\cdot\\vec{B}$ of electromagnetism due to vanishing\nelectromagnetic and color anomalies. The ULA couples to fermions with strength\n$g\\propto 1/f_{\\rm ULA}$. This coupling causes spin precession of nucleons and\nelectrons with respect to the DM wind with period $t\\sim$months. Current limits\ndo not exclude the predicted coupling strength, and our model is within reach\nof the CASPEr-Wind experiment, using nuclear magnetic resonance.\n", "  We investigate the impact of starspots on the evolution of late-type stars\nduring the pre-main sequence (pre-MS). We find that heavy spot coverage\nincreases the radii of stars by 4-10%, consistent with inflation factors in\neclipsing binary systems, and suppresses the rate of pre-MS lithium depletion,\nleading to a dispersion in zero-age MS Li abundance (comparable to observed\nspreads) if a range of spot properties exist within clusters from 3-10 Myr.\nThis concordance with data implies that spots induce a range of radii at fixed\nmass during the pre-MS. These spots decrease the luminosity and $T_{\\rm eff}$\nof stars, leading to a displacement on the HR diagram. This displacement causes\nisochrone derived masses and ages to be systematically under-estimated, and can\nlead to the spurious appearance of an age spread in a co-eval population.\n", "  This work studies the limits of far and near-field electromagnetic response\nof sub-wavelength scatterers, like the unitary limit and of lossless\nscatterers, and the ideal absorption limit of lossy particles. These limit\nbehaviors are described in terms of analytic formulas that approximate finite\nsize effects while rigorously including radiative corrections. This analysis\npredicts the electric and/or magnetic limit responses of both metallic and\ndielectric nanoparticles while quantitatively describing near-field\nenhancements.\n", "  We investigate equatorial geodesics in the gravitational field of a rotating\nand deformed source described by the approximate Hartle-Thorne metric. In the\ncase of massive particles, we derive within the same approximation analytic\nexpressions for the orbital angular velocity, the specific angular momentum and\nenergy, and the radii of marginally stable and marginally bound circular\norbits. Moreover, we calculate the orbital angular velocity and the radius of\nlightlike circular geodesics. We study numerically the frame dragging effect\nand the influence of the quadrupolar deformation of the source on the motion of\ntest particles. We show that the effects originating from the rotation can be\nbalanced by the effects due to the oblateness of the source.\n", "  Although current sensitivity limits are such that true Solar System analogs\nremain challenging to detect, numerous planetary systems have been discovered\nthat are very different from our own Solar System. The majority of systems\nharbor a new class of planets, bodies that are typically several times more\nmassive than the Earth but that orbit their host stars well inside the orbit of\nMercury. These planets frequently show evidence for large Hydrogen and Helium\nenvelopes containing several percent of the planet's mass and display a large\ndiversity in mean densities. Here we show that this wide range can be achieved\nby one or two late giant impacts, which are frequently needed to achieve\nlong-term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has\ndisappeared. We demonstrate using hydrodynamical simulations that a single\ncollision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the\nenvelope-to-core-mass ratio by a factor of two and show that this leads to a\ncorresponding increase in the observed mean density by factors of 2-3. In\naddition we investigate how envelope-mass-loss depends on envelope mass, planet\nradius, semi-major axis, and the mass distribution inside the envelope. We\npropose that a small number of giant impacts may be responsible for the large\nobserved spread in mean densities, especially for multiple-planet systems\ncontaining planets with very different densities and which have not been\nsignificantly sculpted by photo evaporation.\n", "  Ferrofluids are familiar as colloidal suspensions of ferromagnetic\nnanoparticles in aqueous or organic solvents. The dispersed particles are\nrandomly oriented but their moments become aligned if a magnetic field is\napplied, producing a variety of exotic and useful magneto-mechanical effects. A\nlongstanding interest and challenge has been to make such suspensions\nmacroscopically ferromagnetic, that is having uniform magnetic alignment in\nabsence of a field. Here we report a fluid suspension of magnetic nanoplates\nwhich spontaneously aligns into an equilibrium nematic liquid crystal phase\nthat is also macroscopically ferromagnetic. Its zero-field magnetization\nproduces distinctive magnetic self-interaction effects, including liquid\ncrystal textures of fluid block domains arranged in closed flux loops, and\nmakes this phase highly sensitive, with it dramatically changing shape even in\nthe Earth's magnetic field.\n", "  The Stokes Mueller polarimetry is generalized to include nonlinear optical\nprocesses such as second- and third-harmonic generation, sum- and\ndifference-frequency generations. The overall algebraic form of the polarimetry\nis preserved, where the incoming and outgoing radiations are represented by\ncolumn vectors and the intervening medium is represented by a matrix.\nExpressions for the generalized nonlinear Stokes vector and the Mueller matrix\nare provided in terms of coherency and correlation matrices, expanded by\nhigher-dimensional analogues of Pauli matrices. In all cases, the outgoing\nradiation is represented by the conventional $4\\times 1$ Stokes vector, while\ndimensions of the incoming radiation Stokes vector and Mueller matrix depend on\nthe order of the process being examined. In addition, relation between\nnonlinear susceptibilities and the measured Mueller matrices are explicitly\nprovided. Finally, the approach of combining linear and nonlinear optical\nelements is discussed within the context of polarimetry.\n", "  Lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies of electromagnetic properties of\nhadrons and light nuclei, such as magnetic moments and polarizabilities, have\nproven successful with the use of background field methods. With an\nimplementation of nonuniform background electromagnetic fields, properties such\nas charge radii and higher electromagnetic multipole moments (for states of\nhigher spin) can be additionally obtained. This can be achieved by matching\nlattice QCD calculations to a corresponding low-energy effective theory that\ndescribes the static and quasi-static response of hadrons and nuclei to weak\nexternal fields. With particular interest in the case of vector mesons and\nspin-1 nuclei such as the deuteron, we present an effective field theory of\nspin-1 particles coupled to external electromagnetic fields. To constrain the\ncharge radius and the electric quadrupole moment of the composite spin-1 field,\nthe single-particle Green's functions in a linearly varying electric field in\nspace are obtained within the effective theory, providing explicit expressions\nthat can be used to match directly onto lattice QCD correlation functions. The\nviability of an extraction of the charge radius and the electric quadrupole\nmoment of the deuteron from the upcoming lattice QCD calculations of this\nnucleus is discussed.\n", "  Low-mass, pre-main sequence stars possess intense high-energy radiation\nfields as a result of their strong stellar magnetic activity. This stellar UV\nand X-ray radiation may have a profound impact on the lifetimes of\nprotoplanetary disks. We aim to constrain the X-ray-induced photoevaporation\nrates of protoplanetary disks orbiting low-mass stars by analyzing\nserendipitous XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations of candidate nearby (D\n$<$ 100 pc), young (age $<$ 100 Myr) M stars identified in the GALEX Nearby\nYoung-Star Survey (GALNYSS).\n", "  We present an impedance engineered Josephson parametric amplifier capable of\nproviding bandwidth beyond the traditional gain-bandwidth product. We achieve\nthis by introducing a positive linear slope in the imaginary component of the\ninput impedance seen by the Josephson oscillator using a $\\lambda/2$\ntransformer. Our theoretical model predicts an extremely flat gain profile with\na bandwidth enhancement proportional to the square root of amplitude gain. We\nexperimentally demonstrate a nearly flat 20 dB gain over a 640 MHz band, along\nwith a mean 1-dB compression point of -110 dBm and near quantum-limited noise.\nThe results are in good agreement with our theoretical model.\n", "  To analyze the SACY (Search for Associations Containing Young stars) survey\nwe developed a method to find young associations and to define their high\nprobability members. These bona fide members enable to obtain the kinematical\nand the physical properties of each association in a proper way. Recently we\nnoted a concentration in the UV plane and we found a new association we are\ncalling ASYA (All Sky Young Association) for its overall distribution in the\nsky with a total of 38 bonafide members and an estimated age of 110 Myr, the\noldest young association found in the SACY survey. We present here its\nkinematical, space and Li distributions and its HR diagram.\n", "  Unlike the Coulomb potential that acts between all semiconductor carriers,\nthe potential commonly used for BCS superconductors and cold atom gases acts\nbetween different fermion species only, these species differing by their spin\nor hyperfine index. The coboson formalism we here develop evidences that such\ncomposite bosons interact through fermion exchange only, thus rendering the\nstructure of the Shiva diagrams that visualize their many-body effects far\nsimpler. A separable potential is used to obtain analytical results for the\n$N$-coboson normalization factor and the $N$-coboson ground-state energy within\nthe Born approximation, in terms of the Born dimer-dimer scattering length.\nThis formalism opens the route toward approaching complex many-body effects,\nsuch as Bose-Einstein condensation, through a new perspective.\n", "  In the d=3 gluon mass problem in pure-glue non-Abelian $SU(N)$ gauge theory\nwe pay particular attention to the observed (in Landau gauge) violation of\npositivity for the spectral function of the gluon propagator. This causes a\nlarge bulge in the propagator at small momentum. Mass is defined through\n$m^{-2}=\\Delta (p=0)$, where $\\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon\npropagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally\ngauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We\ntruncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that\nautomatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT\nvertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous\nBethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation\nalso encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar\nexcitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany\ngauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for\n$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap\nequation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass. Our\npoint is not to give a high-accuracy determination of $m$ but to clarify the\nway in which the propagator bulge and a fairly accurate estimate of $m$ can\nco-exist, and we use various approximations that illustrate the underlying\nmechanisms. The most critical point is to satisfy the Ward identity. In the PT\nwe estimate a gauge-invariant dynamical gluon mass of $m \\approx Ng^2/(2.48\n\\pi)$. We translate these results to the Landau gauge using a\nbackground-quantum identity involving a dynamical quantity $\\kappa$ such that\n$m=\\kappa m_L$, where $m_L^{-2}\\equiv \\Delta_L(p=0)$. Given our estimates for\n$m,\\kappa$ the relation is fortuitously well-satisfied for $SU(2)$ lattice\ndata.\n", "  To elucidate the origin of nematic order in Fe-based superconductors, we\nreport a Raman scattering study of lattice dynamics, which quantify the extent\nof $C_4$-symmetry breaking, in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and FeSe. FeSe possesses a\nnematic ordering temperature $T_\\mathrm{s}$ and orbital-related band-energy\nsplit below $T_\\mathrm{s}$ that are similar to those in BaFe$_2$As$_2$, but\nunlike BaFe$_2$As$_2$ it has no long-range magnetic order. We find that the\n$E_g$ phonon-energy split in FeSe sets in only well below $T_\\mathrm{s}$, and\nits saturated value is substantially smaller than that in BaFe$_2$As$_2$.\nTogether with reported results for the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ family,\nthe data suggest that magnetism exerts a major influence on the lattice.\n", "  Water dissociation is a rate limiting step in many industrially important\nchemical reactions. In this investigation, climbing image nudged elastic band\n(CINEB) method, within the framework of density functional theory, is used to\nreport the activation energies (E a ) of water dissociation on Cu(111) surface\nwith a vacancy. Introduction of vacancy results in a reduced coordination of\nthe dissociated products, which facilitates their availability for reactions\nthat involve water dissociation as an intermediate step. Activation energy for\ndissociation of water reduces by nearly 0.2 eV on Cu(111) surface with vacancy,\nin comparison with that of pristine Cu(111) surface. We also find that surface\nmodification of the Cu upper surface is one of the possible pathways to\ndissociate water when the vacancy is introduced. Activation energy, and the\nminimum energy path (MEP) leading to the transition state remain same for\nvarious product configurations. CINEB corresponding to hydrogen gas evolution\nis also performed which shows that it is a two step process involving water\ndissociation. We conclude that the introduction of vacancy facilitates the\nwater dissociation reaction, by reducing the activation energy by about 20%.\n", "  Many members of nearby young moving groups exhibit infrared excess attributed\nto circumstellar debris dust, formed via erosion of planetesimals. With their\nproximity and well-dated ages, these groups are excellent laboratories for\nstudying the early evolution of debris dust and of planetesimal belts. ALMA can\nspatially resolve the disk emission, revealing the location and extent of these\nbelts, putting constraints on planetesimal evolution models, and allowing us to\nstudy planet-disk interactions. While the main trends of dust evolution in\ndebris disks are well-known, there is almost no information on the evolution of\ngas. During the transition from protoplanetary to debris state, even the origin\nof gas is dubious. Here we review the exciting new results ALMA provided by\nobserving young debris disks, and discuss possible future research directions.\n", "  Fomalhaut b was long thought to shape the eccentric debris belt in the\nFomalhaut system, but its orbit was found to be too eccentric for it to be the\ndominant belt-shaping perturber. This indicates that Fomalhaut b is Earth-sized\nat most and that the belt-shaping perturber, hereafter named Fomalhaut c,\nremains to be discovered. In addition, since its orbit more or less crosses\nthat of Fomalhaut b, it also indicates that the current configuration of the\nsystem is transient and was reached recently. In this talk, we show that this\ncurrent configuration can be explained if Fomalhaut c is Saturn- to\nNeptune-sized, and Fomalhaut b originates from a mean-motion resonance with\nFomalhaut c.\n", "  Observations of X-ray flares from Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) imply strong\nconstraints on possible physical models. We provide a general discussion of\nthese. In particular, we show that in order to account for the relatively flat\nand weak optical flux during the X-ray flares, the size of the emitting region\nshould be $\\lesssim 3\\times 10^{14}$cm. The bolometric luminosity of flares\nalso strongly constrain the energy budget, and are inconsistent with late time\nactivity of a central engine powered by the spin-down of a magnetar. We provide\na simple toy model according to which flares are produced by an outflow of\nmodest Lorentz factor (a few tens instead of hundreds) that is launched more or\nless simultaneously with the highly relativistic jet which produced the prompt\ngamma-ray emission. The \"slower\" moving outflow produces the flare as it\nreaches its photosphere. The existence of such a component would naturally\nresolve the observational challenges imposed by flares, outlined in this work.\n", "  Nambu--Jona-Lasinio-type models have been used extensively to study the\ndynamics of the theory of the strong interaction at finite temperature and\nquark chemical potential on a phenomenological level. In addition to these\nstudies, which are often performed under the assumption that the ground state\nof the theory is homogeneous, searches for the existence of crystalline phases\nassociated with inhomogeneous ground states have attracted a lot of interest in\nrecent years. In this work, we study the Polyakov-loop extended\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model and find that the existence of a crystalline phase is\nstable against a variation of the parametrization of the underlying Polyakov\nloop potential. To this end, we adopt two prominent parametrizations. Moreover,\nwe observe that the existence of a quarkyonic phase depends crucially on the\nparametrization, in particular in the regime of the phase diagram where\ninhomogeneous chiral condensation is favored.\n", "  We propose that two of the most surprising results so far among exoplanet\ndiscoveries are related: the existences of both hot Jupiters and the high\nfrequency of multi-planet systems with periods $P\\lesssim200$~days. In this\nparadigm, the vast majority of stars rapidly form along with multiple close-in\nplanets in the mass range of Mars to super-Earths/mini-Neptunes. Such systems\nof tightly-packed inner planets (STIPs) are metastable, with the time scale of\nthe dynamical instability having a major influence on final planet types. In\nmost cases, the planets consolidate into a system of fewer, more massive\nplanets, but long after the circumstellar gas disk has dissipated. This can\nyield planets with masses above the traditional critical core of $\\sim$10\n$M_\\oplus$, yielding short-period giants that lack abundant gas. A rich variety\nof physical states are also possible given the range of collisional outcomes\nand formation time of the close-in planets. However, when dynamical\nconsolidation occurs before gas dispersal, a critical core can form that then\ngrows via gas capture into a short-period gas giant. In this picture the\nmajority of Hot and Warm Jupiters formed locally, rather than migrating down\nfrom larger distances.\n", "  We explore the adsorption of MoS2 on a range of metal substrates by means of\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations. Including van der\nWaals forces in the density functional is essential to capture the interaction\nbetween MoS2 and a metal surface, and obtain reliable interface potential steps\nand Schottky barriers. Special care is taken to construct interface structures\nthat have a mismatch between the MoS2 and the metal lattices of <1%. MoS2 is\nchemisorbed on the early transition metal Ti, which leads to a strong\nperturbation of its (electronic) structure and a pinning of the Fermi level\n0.54 eV below the MoS2 conduction band due to interface states. MoS2 is\nphysisorbed on Au, where the bonding hardly perturbs the electronic structure.\nThe bonding of MoS2 on other metals lies between these two extreme cases, with\ninterface interactions for the late 3d transition metals Co, Ni, Cu and the\nsimple metal Mg that are somewhat stronger than for the late 4d/5d transition\nmetals Pd, Ag, Pt and the simple metal Al. Even a weak interaction, such as in\nthe case of Al, gives interface states, however, with energies inside the MoS2\nband gap, which pin the Fermi level below the conduction band.\n", "  Starting with the relativistic Boltzmann equation for a system of particles\ndefined by a distribution function, we have derived the virial relation for a\nspherical structure within an expanding background in the context of general\nrelativity. This generalized form of the virial relation is then applied to the\nstatic case of a spherically symmetric structure to see the difference in the\nsimplest case to the Newtonian relation. A relativistic Mass-Temperature\nrelation for this simple case is also derived which can be applied to compact\nobjects in astrophysics. Our general virial relation is then applied to the\nnon-static case of a structure within an expanding universe where an extra\nterm, usually missed in studies of structures in the presence of the dark\nenergy, appears.\n", "  We theoretically propose how to observe topological effects in a generic\nclassical system of coupled harmonic oscillators, such as classical pendula or\nlumped-element electric circuits, whose oscillation frequency is modulated fast\nin time. Making use of Floquet theory in the high frequency limit, we identify\na regime in which the system is accurately described by a Harper-Hofstadter\nmodel where the synthetic magnetic field can be externally tuned via the phase\nof the frequency-modulation of the different oscillators. We illustrate how the\ntopologically-protected chiral edge states, as well as the Hofstadter butterfly\nof bulk bands, can be observed in the driven-dissipative steady state under a\nmonochromatic drive. In analogy with the integer quantum Hall effect, we show\nhow the topological Chern numbers of the bands can be extracted from the mean\ntransverse shift of the steady-state oscillation amplitude distribution.\nFinally we discuss the regime where the analogy with the Harper-Hofstadter\nmodel breaks down.\n", "  Motivated by recent discussions, both in private and in the literature, we\nuse a Monte Carlo simulation of planetary systems to investigate sources of\nbias in determining the mass-radius distribution of exoplanets for the two\nprimary techniques used to measure planetary masses---Radial Velocities (RVs)\nand Transit Timing Variations (TTVs). We assert that mass measurements derived\nfrom these two methods are comparably reliable---as the physics underlying\ntheir respective signals is well understood. Nevertheless, their sensitivity to\nplanet mass varies with the properties of the planets themselves. We find that\nfor a given planet size, the RV method tends to find planets with higher mass\nwhile the sensitivity of TTVs is more uniform. This ``sensitivity bias''\nimplies that a complete census of TTV systems is likely to yield a more robust\nestimate of the mass-radius distribution provided there are not important\nphysical differences between planets near and far from mean-motion resonance.\nWe discuss differences in the sensitivity of the two methods with orbital\nperiod and system architecture, which may compound the discrepancies between\nthem (e.g., short period planets detectable by RVs may be more dense due to\natmospheric loss). We advocate for continued mass measurements using both\napproaches as a means both to measure the masses of more planets and to\nidentify potential differences in planet structure that may result from their\ndynamical and environmental histories.\n", "  Quantum optics did not, and could not, flourish without the laser. The\npresent paper is not about the principles of laser construction, still less a\nhistory of how the laser was invented. Rather, it addresses the question: what\nare the fundamental features that distinguish laser light from thermal light?\nThe obvious answer, \"laser light is coherent\", is, I argue, so vague that it\nmust be put aside at the start, albeit to revisit later. A more specific,\nquantum theoretic, version, \"laser light is in a coherent state\", is simply\nwrong in this context: both laser light and thermal light can equally well be\ndescribed by coherent states, with amplitudes that vary stochastically in\nspace. Instead, my answer to the titular question is that four principles are\nneeded: high directionality, monochromaticity, high brightness, and stable\nintensity. Combining the first three of these principles suffices to show, in a\nquantitative way --- involving, indeed, very large dimensionless quantities (up\nto $\\sim10^{51}$) --- that a laser must be constructed very differently from a\nlight bulb. This quantitative analysis is quite simple, and is easily relatable\nto \"coherence\", yet is not to be found in any text-books on quantum optics to\nmy knowledge. The fourth principle is the most subtle and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, is the only one related to coherent states in the quantum optics\nsense: it implies that the description in terms of coherent states is the only\nsimple description of a laser beam. Interestingly, this leads to the (not, as\nit turns out, entirely new) prediction that narrowly filtered laser beams are\nindistinguishable from similarly filtered thermal beams. I hope that other\neducators find this material useful, it may contain surprises even for\nresearchers who have been in the field longer than I have.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the kinematics of M dwarfs in the CARMENES\n(Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with\nNear-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) input catalog. We have\nselected all M dwarfs with known parallactic distance or a good photometric\ndistance estimation, precise proper motion in the literature or as determined\nby us, and radial velocity measurements. Using these parameters, we computed\nthe M dwarfs galactic space motions (U, V, W). For the stars with U and V\nvelocity components inside or near the boundaries that determine the young disk\npopulation, we have analyzed the possible membership in the classical moving\ngroups and nearby loose associations with ages between 10 and 600 Ma. For the\ncandidate members, we have compiled information available in the literature in\norder to constrain their membership by applying other age-dating methods.\n", "  We present a novel approach to constrain the formation channels of\nUltra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies (UCDs). This inhomogeneous class of objects of\nremnants of tidally stripped dwarf elliptical galaxies and high mass globular\nclusters. We use three methods to unravel their nature: 1) we analysed their\nsurface brightness profiles, 2) we carried out a direct search for tidal\nfeatures around UCDs and 3) we compared the spatial distribution of GCs and\nUCDs in the halo of their host galaxy.\n  Based on FORS2 observations, we have studied the detailed structural\ncomposition of a large sample of 97 UCDs in the halo of NGC1399, the central\ngalaxy of the Fornax cluster, by analysing theirsurface brightness profiles. We\nderived the structural parameters of 13 extended UCDs modelling them with a\nsingle Sersic function and decomposing them into composite King and Sersic\nprofiles. We find evidence for faint stellar envelopes at mu=~26 mag\\arcsec^-2\nsurrounding the UCDs up to an extension of 90pc in radius.\n  We also show new evidence for faint asymmetric structures and tidal tail-like\nfeatures surrounding several of these UCDs, a possible tracer of their origin\nand assembly history within their host galaxy halos. In particular, we present\nevidence for the first discovery of a significant tidal tail with an extension\nof ~350pc around UCD-FORS2.\n  We searched for local overdensities in the spatial distribution of globular\nclusters within the halo of NGC1399, to see if they are related to the\npositions of the UCDs. We found a local overabundance of globular clusters on a\nscale of <1kpc around UCDs, when we compare it to the distribution of globulars\nfrom the host galaxy. This effect is strongest for the metal-poor blue GCs. We\ndiscuss how likely it is that these clustered globulars were originally\nassociated with the UCD.\n", "  Phonon spectra of detwinned {SrFe$_2$As$_2$} crystals, as measured by\ninelastic x-ray scattering, show clear anisotropy accompanying the\nmagneto-structural transition at 200 K. We model the mode splitting using\nmagnetic DFT calculations, including a phenomenological reduction in\nforce-constant anisotropy that can be attributed to magnetic fluctuations. This\nserves as a starting point for a general model of phonons in this material\napplicable to both magnetic and non-magnetic phase. Using this model, the\nmeasured splitting in the magnetic phase below $\\it T_{N}$, and the measured\nphonon linewidth, we set a lower bound on the mean magnetic fluctuation\nfrequency above $\\it T_{N}$ at 210 K.\n", "  Adaptive data collection and analysis, where data are being fed back to\nupdate the measurement settings, can greatly increase speed, precision, and\nreliability of the characterization of quantum systems. However, decoherence\ntends to make adaptive characterization difficult. As an example, we consider\ntwo coupled discrete quantum systems. When one of the systems can be controlled\nand measured, the standard method to characterize another, with an unknown\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$, is swap spectroscopy. Here, adapting measurements\ncan provide estimates whose error decreases exponentially in the number of\nmeasurement shots rather than as a power law in conventional swap spectroscopy.\nHowever, when the decoherence time is so short that an excitation oscillating\nbetween the two systems can only undergo less than a few tens of vacuum Rabi\noscillations, this approach can be marred by a severe limit on accuracy unless\ncarefully designed. We adopt machine learning techniques to search for\nefficient policies for the characterization of decohering quantum systems. We\nfind, for instance, that when the system undergoes more than 2 Rabi\noscillations during its relaxation time $T_1$, $O(10^3)$ measurement shots are\nsufficient to reduce the squared error of the Bayesian initial prior of the\nunknown frequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ by a factor $O(10^4)$ or larger. We also\ndevelop policies optimized for extreme initial parameter uncertainty and for\nthe presence of imperfections in the readout.\n", "  While searches for young stellar objects (YSOs) with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope focused on known molecular clouds, photometry from the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) can be used to extend the search to the entire\nsky. As a precursor to more expansive searches, we present results for a 100\nsquare degree region centered on the Canis Major clouds.\n", "  Future large-scale galaxy surveys have the potential to become leading probes\nfor cosmology provided the influence of baryons on the total mass distribution\nis understood well enough. As hydrodynamical simulations strongly depend on\ndetails in the feedback implementations, no unique and robust predictions for\nbaryonic effects currently exist. In this paper we propose a baryonic\ncorrection model that modifies the density field of dark-matter-only $N$-body\nsimulations to mimic the effects of baryons from any underlying adopted\nfeedback recipe. The model assumes haloes to consist of 4 components: 1- hot\ngas in hydrostatical equilibrium, 2- ejected gas from feedback processes, 3-\ncentral galaxy stars, and 4- adiabatically relaxed dark matter, which all\nmodify the initial dark-matter-only density profiles. These altered profiles\nallow to define a displacement field for particles in $N$-body simulations and\nto modify the total density field accordingly. The main advantage of the\nbaryonic correction model is to connect the total matter density field to the\nobservable distribution of gas and stars in haloes, making it possible to\nparametrise baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. We show that the\nmost crucial quantities are the mass fraction of ejected gas and its\ncorresponding ejection radius. The former controls how strongly baryons\nsuppress the power spectrum, while the latter provides a measure of the scale\nwhere baryonic effects become important. A comparison with X-ray and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster observations suggests that baryons suppress wave\nmodes above $k\\sim0.5$ h/Mpc with a maximum suppression of 10-25 percent around\n$k\\sim 2$ h/Mpc. More detailed observations of the gas in the outskirts of\ngroups and clusters are required to decrease the large uncertainties of these\nnumbers.\n", "  We explore star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies based on the evolution\nof the star-formation rate stellar mass relation (SFR-M*). Using data from the\nFourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging\nfrom the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at\n0.5 < z < 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of\ngalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad\nrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.\nWe find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of\nthe form SFR ~ M*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at low\nmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M_0) that ranges from\n10^9.5 - 10^10.8 Msol, with evidence that M_0 increases with redshift. We\ncompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological\nsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation\nalbeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate\nSFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and\ndecline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive\ngalaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass-growth histories and compare\nto the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. We\nfind that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that\nthere is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs\nsuggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from the\nstellar mass function. However, at later times the SFHs under-predict the\ninferred evolution, as is expected in the case of additional growth due to\nmergers.\n", "  We consider an ideal invisibility cloak which is illuminated by monochromatic\nlight and which moves in vacuum at constant relativistic velocity with respect\nto the common inertial frame of light source and observer. We show that, in\ngeneral, the moving cloak becomes detectable by image distortions and by\ngenerating a broad frequency spectrum of the scattered light. However, for many\nspecial combinations of incident light frequency, wave vector of light, and\ncloak velocity, ideal cloaking remains possible. It becomes non-reciprocal\nthough. This means that light rays emitted by the light source arrive at the\nobserver as though they have travelled through vacuum, but they take completely\ndifferent paths after being retro-reflected at the observer position.\n", "  We investigate the equilibration of a small isolated quantum system by means\nof its matrix of asymptotic transition probabilities in a preferential basis.\nThe trace of this matrix is shown to measure the degree of equilibration of the\nsystem launched from a typical state, from the standpoint of the chosen basis.\nThis approach is substantiated by an in-depth study of the example of a\ntight-binding particle in one dimension. In the regime of free ballistic\npropagation, the above trace saturates to a finite limit, testifying good\nequilibration. In the presence of a random potential, the trace grows linearly\nwith the system size, testifying poor equilibration in the insulating regime\ninduced by Anderson localization. In the weak-disorder situation of most\ninterest, a universal finite-size scaling law describes the crossover between\nthe ballistic and localized regimes. The associated crossover exponent 2/3 is\ndictated by the anomalous band-edge scaling characterizing the most localized\nenergy eigenstates.\n", "  The Solar System contains a population of dust and small particles\noriginating from asteroids, comets, and other bodies. These particles have been\nstudied using a number of techniques ranging from in-situ satellite detectors\nto analysis of lunar microcraters to ground-based observations of zodiacal\nlight. In this paper, we describe an approach for using the LISA Pathfinder\n(LPF) mission as an instrument to detect and characterize the dynamics of dust\nparticles in the vicinity of Earth-Sun L1. Launching in late 2015, LPF is a\ndedicated technology demonstrator mission that will validate several key\ntechnologies for a future space-based gravitational-wave observatory. The\nprimary science instrument aboard LPF is a precision accelerometer which we\nshow will be capable of sensing discrete momentum impulses as small as $4\\times\n10^{-8}\\,\\textrm{N}\\cdot\\textrm{s}$. We then estimate the rate of such impulses\nresulting from impacts of micrometeoroids based on standard models of the\nmicrometeoroid environment in the inner solar system. We find that LPF may\ndetect dozens to hundreds of individual events corresponding to impacts of\nparticles with masses $> 10^{-9}\\,$g during LPF's roughly six-month science\noperations phase in a $5\\times 10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ by $8\\times\n10^5\\,\\textrm{km}$ Lissajous orbit around L1. In addition, we estimate the\nability of LPF to characterize individual impacts by measuring quantities such\nas total momentum transferred, direction of impact, and location of impact on\nthe spacecraft. Information on flux and direction provided by LPF may provide\ninsight as to the nature and origin of the individual impact and help constrain\nmodels of the interplanetary dust complex in general. Additionally, this direct\nin-situ measurement of micrometeoroid impacts will be valuable to designers of\nfuture spacecraft targeting the environment around L1.\n", "  We argue that theories with multiple axions generically contain a large\nnumber of vacua that can account for the smallness of the cosmological\nconstant. In a theory with N axions, the dominant instantons with charges Q\ndetermine the discrete symmetry of vacua. Subleading instantons break the\nleading periodicity and lift the vacuum degeneracy. For generic integer charges\nthe number of distinct vacua is given by |det(Q)|~exp(N). Our construction\nmotivates the existence of a landscape with a vast number of vacua in a large\nclass of four-dimensional effective theories.\n", "  Context. Several new techniques to determine the metallicity of M dwarfs with\nbetter precision have been developed over the last decades. However, most of\nthese studies were based on empirical methods. In order to enable detailed\nabundance analysis, standard methods established for warmer solar-like stars,\ni.e. model-dependent methods using fitting of synthetic spectra, still need to\nbe used. Aims. In this work we continue the reliability confirmation and\ndevelopment of metallicity determinations of M dwarfs using high- resolution\ninfrared spectra. The reliability was confirmed though analysis of M dwarfs in\nfour binary systems with FGK dwarf companions and by comparison with previous\noptical studies of the FGK dwarfs. Methods. The metallicity determination was\nbased on spectra taken in the J band (1.1-1.4 {\\mu}m) with the CRIRES\nspectrograph. In this part of the infrared, the density of stellar molecular\nlines is limited, reducing the amount of blends with atomic lines enabling an\naccurate continuum placement. Lines of several atomic species were used to\ndetermine the stellar metallicity. Results. All binaries show excellent\nagreement between the derived metallicity of the M dwarf and its binary\ncompanion. Our results are also in good agreement with values found in the\nliterature. Furthermore, we propose an alternative way to determine the\neffective temperature of M dwarfs of spectral types later than M2 through\nsynthetic spectral fitting of the FeH lines in our observed spectra.\nConclusions. We have confirmed that a reliable metallicity determination of M\ndwarfs can be achieved using high-resolution infrared spectroscopy. We also\nnote that metallicites obtained with photometric metallicity calibrations\navailable for M dwarfs only partly agree with the results we obtain from\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy.\n", "  In the double field theory, gauge symmetries are realized as generalized\ndiffeomorphisms in the doubled spacetime. By consistency of the theory,\ndependence of tensor fields on the doubled coordinates is strongly constrained.\nThis causes finite transformation law highly complicated, both technically and\nconceptually. In this paper, we propose a new, physically intuitive approach to\nfinite gauge transformations by utilizing untwisted form of vector fields. In\nour approach, finite gauge transformation law is expressed in terms of\ndiffeomorphisms on a maximal null subspace on which dynamical degrees of\nfreedom live and of a local rotation of this null subspace embedded inside the\ndoubled space. We show that our finite transformation automatically satisfies\nthe composition law. We also show that ours is free from the so-called\nPapadopoulos problem, so can describe background with nontrivial three-form\nflux $H_3$. Added advantage of our approach is straightforward applicability to\ngeneral extended field theories. We demonstrate this by explicitly obtaining\nfinite transformation law in the SL(5) exceptional field theory.\n", "  We report a reinvestigation of superconducting Sn$_{1-x}$In$_{x}$Te at both\nlow and high In doping levels. Analysis of the superconductivity reveals a\nfundamental change as a function of \\textit{x}: the system evolves from a\nweakly coupled to a strongly coupled superconductor with increasing indium\ncontent. Hall Effect measurements further show that the carrier density does\nnot vary linearly with Indium content; indeed at high Indium content, the\nsamples are overall \\textit{n}-type, which is contrary to expectations of the\nstandard picture of In$^{1+}$ replacing Sn$^{2+}$ in this material. Density\nfunctional theory calculations probing the electronic state of In in SnTe show\nthat it does not act as a trivial hole dopant, but instead forms a distinct,\npartly filled In 5\\textit{s} - Te 5\\textit{p} hybridized state centered around\nE$_F$, very different from what is seen for other nominal hole dopants such as\nNa, Ag, and vacant Sn sites. We conclude that superconducting In-doped SnTe\ntherefore cannot be considered as a simple hole doped semiconductor.\n", "  To understand the relation between the chiral symmetry breaking and\nmonopoles, the chiral condensate which is the order parameter of the chiral\nsymmetry breaking is calculated in the $\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}$ scheme at 2\n[GeV]. First, we add one pair of monopoles, varying the monopole charges\n$m_{c}$ from zero to four, to SU(3) quenched configurations by a monopole\ncreation operator. The low-lying eigenvalues of the Overlap Dirac operator are\ncomputed from the gauge links of the normal configurations and the\nconfigurations with additional monopoles. Next, we compare the distributions of\nthe nearest-neighbor spacing of the low-lying eigenvalues with the prediction\nof the random matrix theory. The low-lying eigenvalues not depending on the\nscale parameter $\\Sigma$ are compared to the prediction of the random matrix\ntheory. The results show the consistency with the random matrix theory. Thus,\nthe additional monopoles do not affect the low-lying eigenvalues. Moreover, we\ndiscover that the additional monopoles increase the scale parameter $\\Sigma$.\nWe then evaluate the chiral condensate in the $\\overline{\\mbox{MS}}$ scheme at\n2 [GeV] from the scale parameter $\\Sigma$ and the renormalization constant\n$Z_{S}$. The final results clearly show that the chiral condensate linearly\ndecreases by increasing the monopole charges.\n", "  A combination of experiments and numerical modeling was used to study the\nspatial evolution of the ferromagnetic phase transition in a thin film\nengineered to have a smooth gradient in exchange strength. Mean-field\nsimulations predict, and experiments confirm that a 100 nm Ni[x]Cu[1-x] alloy\nfilm with Ni concentration that varies by 9 % as a function of depth behaves\npredominantly as if comprised of a continuum of uncoupled ferromagnetic layers\nwith continuously varying Curie temperatures. A mobile boundary separating\nordered and disordered regions emerges as temperature is increased. We\ndemonstrate continuous control of the boundary position with temperature, and\nreversible control of the magnetically ordered sample volume with magnetic\nfield.\n", "  We aim at analyzing the (sub-)millimeter emission in a nearby blazar, PKS\n0521-365 , to study the synchrotron and thermal emission in the different\ncomponents detected at low frequency. We analyze the archive public data of the\nALMA Cycle 0 where PKS 0521-365 is used as a calibrator. A total of 13 projects\nwith 23 dataset is analyzed in band 3, 6 and 7 and combined. The whole set of\ndata is combined and wavelet filtered to obtain a deep image reaching a dynamic\nrange of 47000. The individual emission flux is measured at different date over\na period of 11 months in various components. Finally we analyze the Spectral\nEnergy Distribution (SED) in each different component, including the radio jet\nand counter jet. The point sources detected in the field follow a similar\ndistribution to previous studies. The blazar flux shows large variation\nespecially in band 3. Different components are observed: core, radio jet and\nnewly detected counter jet, Hot Spot (HS) and a disky structure roughly\nperpendicular to the jet. The HS emission is formed by a point source\nsurrounded by an extended emission. The viewing angle of the jet is about 30\nwith a Doppler factor of 1.6$. The HS is at a distance of 19 kpc from the\ncenter. The SED analysis shows a strong variation of the core spectral index,\nespecially in band 3. The two components in the radio jet have roughly a flat\nspectral index in band 6 and 7. Using these ALMA data the different weak and\nextended components are detected. The analysis of both jets constrains the\ngeometrical distance of the HS to the center. The SED presents a different\nshape in time and frequency for each component. Finally a new structure is\ndetected roughly perpendicular to the radio jet and a thermal emission origin\nis currently favoured. Further observations at higher spatial resolution are\nneeded to confirm that hypothesis.\n", "  Compact groups of galaxies provide a unique environment to study the\nevolution of galaxies amid frequent gravitational encounters. These nearby\ngroups have conditions similar to those in the earlier universe when galaxies\nwere assembled and give us the opportunity to witness hierarchical formation in\nprogress. To understand how the compact group environment affects galaxy\nevolution, we examine the gas and dust in these groups. We present new\nsingle-dish GBT neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of 30 compact groups and\ndefine a new way to quantify the group HI content as the HI-to-stellar mass\nratio of the group as a whole. We compare the HI content with mid-IR indicators\nof star formation and optical [g-r] color to search for correlations between\ngroup gas content and star formation activity of individual group members.\nQuiescent galaxies tend to live in HI-poor groups, and galaxies with active\nstar formation are more commonly found in HI-rich groups. Intriguingly, we also\nfind \"rogue\" galaxies whose star formation does not correlate with group HI\ncontent. In particular, we identify three galaxies (NGC 2968 in RSCG 34, KUG\n1131+202A in RSCG 42, and NGC 4613 in RSCG 64) whose mid-IR activity is\ndiscrepant with the HI. We speculate that this mismatch between mid-IR activity\nand HI content is a consequence of strong interactions in this environment that\ncan strip HI from galaxies and abruptly affect star-formation. Ultimately,\ncharacterizing how and on what timescales the gas is processed in compact\ngroups will help us understand the interstellar medium in complex, dense\nenvironments similar to the earlier Universe.\n", "  In this study we use multi-epoch near-infrared observations from the VISTA\nsurvey of the Magellanic Cloud system (VMC) to measure the proper motion of\ndifferent stellar populations in a tile of 1.5 deg sq. in size in the direction\nof the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc. We obtain the proper motion of the\ncluster itself, of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), and of the field Milky Way\nstars. Stars of the three main stellar components are selected from their\nspatial distribution and their distribution in colour-magnitude diagrams. Their\naverage coordinate displacement is computed from the difference between\nmultiple Ks-band observations for stars as faint as Ks=19 mag. Proper motions\nare derived from the slope of the best-fitting line among 10 VMC epochs over a\ntime baseline of ~1 yr. Background galaxies are used to calibrate the absolute\nastrometric reference frame. The resulting absolute proper motion of 47 Tuc is\n(mu_alpha cos(delta), mu_delta)=(+7.26+/-0.03, -1.25+/-0.03) mas/yr. This\nmeasurement refers to about 35000 sources distributed between 10 and 60 arcmin\nfrom the cluster centre. For the SMC we obtain (mu_alpha cos(delta),\nmu_delta)=(+1.16+/-0.07, -0.81+/-0.07) mas/yr from about 5250 red clump and red\ngiant branch stars. The absolute proper motion of the Milky Way population in\nthe line-of-sight (l =305.9, b =-44.9) of this VISTA tile is (mu_alpha\ncos(delta), mu_delta)=(+10.22+/-0.14, -1.27+/-0.12) mas/yr and results from\nabout 4000 sources. Systematic uncertainties associated to the astrometric\nreference system are 0.18 mas/yr. Thanks to the proper motion we detect 47 Tuc\nstars beyond its tidal radius.\n", "  Background: Nuclear fission is a complex large-amplitude collective decay\nmode in heavy nuclei. Microscopic density functional studies of fission have\npreviously concentrated on adiabatic approaches based on constrained static\ncalculations ignoring dynamical excitations of the fissioning nucleus, and the\ndaughter products.\n  Purpose: To explore the ability of dynamic mean-field methods to describe\ninduced fission processes, using quadrupole boosts in the nuclide $^{240}$Pu as\nan example.\n  Methods: Quadrupole constrained Hartree-Fock calculations are used to create\na potential energy surface. An isomeric state and a state beyond the second\nbarrier peak are excited by means of instantaneous as well as temporally\nextended gauge boosts with quadrupole shapes. The subsequent deexcitation is\nstudied in a time-dependent Hartree-Fock simulation, with emphasis on fissioned\nfinal states. The corresponding fission fragment mass numbers are studied.\n  Results: In general, the energy deposited by the quadrupole boost is quickly\nabsorbed by the nucleus. In instantaneous boosts, this leads to fast shape\nrearrangements and violent dynamics that can ultimately lead to fission. This\nis a qualitatively different process than the deformation-induced fission.\nBoosts induced within a finite time window excite the system in a relatively\ngentler way, and do induce fission but with a smaller energy deposition.\n  Conclusions: The fission products obtained using boost-induced fission in\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock are more asymmetric than the fragments obtained in\ndeformation-induced fission, or the corresponding adiabatic approaches.\n", "  We study the role of the non-perturbative input to the transverse momentum\ndependent (TMD) gluon density in hard processes at the LHC. We derive the input\nTMD gluon distribution at low scale mu0^2 ~ 1 GeV^2 from the fit of the\ninclusive hadron spectra measured at low transverse momenta in pp collisions at\nthe LHC and demonstrate that the best description of these spectra for larger\nhadron transverse momenta can be achieved by matching the derived TMD gluon\ndistribution with the exact solution of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov\n(BFKL) equation obtained at low x and small gluon transverse momenta outside\nthe saturation region. Then, we extend the input TMD gluon density to higher\nmu^2 numerically using the Catani-Ciafoloni-Fiorani-Marchesini (CCFM) gluon\nevolution equation. A special attention is put to the phenomenological\napplications of obtained TMD gluon density to some LHC processes, which are\nsensitive to the gluon content of a proton.\n", "  Strain fields in graphene giving rise to pseudomagnetic fields have received\nmuch attention due to the possibility of mimicking real magnetic fields with\nmagnitudes of greater than 100 Tesla. We examine systems with such strains\nconfined to finite regions (\"pseudomagnetic dots\") and provide a transparent\nexplanation for the characteristic sublattice polarization occurring in the\npresence of pseudomagnetic field. In particular, we focus on a triaxial strain\nleading to a constant field in the central region of the dot. This field causes\nthe formation of pseudo Landau levels, where the zeroth order level shows\nsignificant differences compared to the corresponding level in a real magnetic\nfield. Analytic arguments based on the Dirac model are employed to predict the\nsublattice and valley dependencies of the density of states in these systems.\nNumerical tight binding calculations of single pseudomagnetic dots in extended\ngraphene sheets confirm these predictions, and are also used to study the\neffect of the rotating the strain direction and varying the size of the\npseudomagnetic dot.\n", "  The breaking of parity, a fundamental symmetry between left and right is best\nunderstood in the framework of left-right symmetric extension of the standard\nmodel. We show that the production of a heavy right-handed neutrino at the\nproposed Large Hadron-Electron Collider (LHeC) could give us the most simple\nand direct hint of the scale of this breaking in left-right symmetric theories.\nThis production mode gives a lepton number violating signal with $\\Delta L=2$\nwhich is very clean and has practically no standard model background. We\nhighlight that the right-handed nature of $W_R$ exchange which defines the\nleft-right symmetric theories can be confirmed by using a polarized electron\nbeam and also enhance the production rates with relatively lower beam energy.\n", "  We present a complete characterization of the fluctuations and correlations\nof the squared overlap in the Edwards-Anderson Spin-Glass model in zero field.\nThe analysis reveals that the energy-energy correlations (and thus the specific\nheat) have a different critical behavior than the fluctuations of the link\noverlap in spite of the fact that the average energy and average link overlap\nhave the same critical properties. More precisely the link-overlap fluctuations\nare larger than the specific heat according to a computation at first order in\nthe $6-\\epsilon$ expansion. An unexpected outcome is that the link-overlap\nfluctuations have a subdominant power-law contribution characterized by an\nanomalous logarithmic prefactor which is missing in the specific heat. In order\nto compute the $\\epsilon$ expansion we consider the problem of the\nrenormalization of quadratic composite operators in a generic multicomponent\ncubic field theory: the results obtained have a range of applicability beyond\nspin-glass theory.\n", "  The electronic band structure of the (Ga,Mn)As system has been one of the\nmost intriguing problems in solid state physics over the past two decades.\nDetermination of the band structure evolution with increasing Mn concentration\nis a key issue to understand the origin of ferromagnetism. Here we present room\ntemperature photoluminescence and ellipsometry measurements of\nGa_{100%-x}Mn_{x}As alloy. The up-shift of the valence-band is proven by the\nred shift of the room temperature near band gap emission from the\nGa_{100%-x}Mn_{x}As alloy with increasing Mn content. It is shown that even a\ndoping by 0.02 at.% of Mn affects the valence-band edge and it merges with the\nimpurity band for a Mn concentration as low as 0.6 at.%. Both X-ray diffraction\npattern and high resolution cross-sectional TEM images confirmed full\nrecrystallization of the implanted layer and GaMnAs alloy formation.\n", "  We have considered non-magnetic materials with weak spin-orbit coupling, that\nare periodic in two non-collinear directions, and finite in third, orthogonal\ndirection. In some cases, combined time-reversal and crystal symmetry of such\nsystems, allows the existence of Dirac cones at certain points in the\nreciprocal space. We have investigated in a systematic way, all points of\nBrillouin zone of all 80 diperiodic groups and have found sufficient conditions\nfor the existence of s=1/2 Dirac fermions, with symmetry-provided band touching\nat the vertex of the Dirac cones. Conversely, complete linear dispersion is\nforbidden for orbital wave-functions belonging to two-dimensional irreducible\nrepresentations (irreps) of little groups that do not satisfy certain\ngroup-theoretical conditions given in this paper. Our results are illustrated\nby a tight-binding example.\n", "  We present an ongoing project to assess the importance of D-waves and the\n$\\Delta (1232)$ resonance for descriptions of neutral pion photoproduction in\nHeavy Baryon Chiral Perturbation Theory. This research has been motivated by\ndata published by the A2 and CB-TAPS collaborations at MAMI [1]. This data has\nreached unprecedented levels of accuracy from threshold through to the $\\Delta$\nresonance. Accompanying the experimental work, there has also been a series of\npublications studying the theory that show that, to go beyond an energy of\n$E_\\gamma=170$ MeV, it is necessary to include other aspects, in particular the\n$\\Delta (1232)$ as a degree of freedom [2] and possibly higher partial waves\n[3].\n", "  After giving a brief introduction and presenting a complete classification of\ngravitational waves (GWs) according to their frequencies, we review and\nsummarize the detection methods, the sensitivities, and the sources. We notice\nthat real-time detections are possible above 300 pHz. Below 300 pHz, the\ndetections are possible on GW imprints or indirectly. We are on the verge of\ndetection. The progress in this field will be promising and thriving. We will\nsee improvement of a few orders to several orders of magnitude in the GW\ndetection sensitivities over all frequency bands in the next hundred years.\n", "  Recently, the IC/CMB X-ray mechanism has been strongly disfavoured for 3C 273\nand PKS 0637-752 since the anomalously hard and steady gamma-ray emission\npredicted by such models violates the observational results from Fermi-LAT.\nHere we propose the proton synchrotron origin of the X ray-gamma ray flux from\nthe knots of PKS 0637-752 with a reasonable budget in luminosity, by\nconsidering synchrotron radiation from an accelerated proton population.\nMoreover, for the source 3C 273, some of the optical data points could not be\nexplained by electron synchrotron (Meyer et al. 2015), which we have included\nin our updated proton synchrotron model. We also show that TeV emission from\nlarge scale quasar jets in principle, can arise from proton synchrotron, which\nwe discuss in the context of knot wk8.9 of PKS 0637-752.\n", "  The effect of the long-range Coulomb interaction on the realization of the\nKohn-Luttinger superconductivity in idealized monolayer doped graphene is\nstudied. It is shown that the allowance for the Kohn-Luttinger renormalizations\nup to the second order in perturbation theory in the on-site Hubbard\ninteraction inclusively, as well as the intersite Coulomb interaction\nsignificantly affects the competition between the superconducting phases with\nthe $f$-wave, $p+ip$-wave and $d + id$-wave symmetries of the order parameter.\nIt is shown that the account for the Coulomb repulsion of electrons located at\nthe next-nearest neighboring atoms in such a system changes qualitatively the\nphase diagram and enhances the critical superconducting temperature.\n", "  The last comprehensive catalogue of high-mass X-ray binaries in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC) was published about ten years ago. Since then new such\nsystems were discovered, mainly by X-ray observations with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton. For the majority of the proposed HMXBs in the SMC no X-ray\npulsations were discovered as yet, and unless other properties of the X-ray\nsource and/or the optical counterpart confirm their HMXB nature, they remain\nonly candidate HMXBs. From a literature search we collected a catalogue of 148\nconfirmed and candidate HMXBs in the SMC and investigated their properties to\nshed light on their real nature. Based on the sample of well-established HMXBs\n(the pulsars), we investigated which observed properties are most appropriate\nfor a reliable classification. We defined different levels of confidence for a\ngenuine HMXB based on spectral and temporal characteristics of the X-ray\nsources and colour-magnitude diagrams from the optical to the infrared of their\nlikely counterparts. We also took the uncertainty in the X-ray position into\naccount. We identify 27 objects that probably are misidentified because they\nlack an infrared excess of the proposed counterpart. They were mainly X-ray\nsources with a large positional uncertainty. This is supported by additional\ninformation obtained from more recent observations. Our catalogue comprises 121\nrelatively high-confidence HMXBs (the vast majority with Be companion stars).\nAbout half of the objects show X-ray pulsations, while for the rest no\npulsations are known as yet. A comparison of the two subsamples suggests that\nlong pulse periods in excess of a few 100 s are expected for the \"non-pulsars\",\nwhich are most likely undetected because of aperiodic variability on similar\ntimescales and insufficiently long X-ray observations. (abbreviated)\n", "  We report the discovery of spiral galaxies that are as optically luminous as\nelliptical brightest cluster galaxies, with r-band monochromatic luminosity\nL_r=8-14L* (4.3-7.5E44 erg/s). These super spiral galaxies are also giant and\nmassive, with diameter D=57-134 kpc and stellar mass M_stars=0.3-3.4E11 M_sun.\nWe find 53 super spirals out of a complete sample of 1616 SDSS galaxies with\nredshift z<0.3 and L_r>8L*. The closest example is found at z=0.089. We use\nexisting photometry to estimate their stellar masses and star formation rates\n(SFRs). The SDSS and WISE colors are consistent with normal star-forming\nspirals on the blue sequence. However, the extreme masses and rapid SFRs of\n5-65 M_sun/yr place super spirals in a sparsely populated region of parameter\nspace, above the star-forming main sequence of disk galaxies. Super spirals\noccupy a diverse range of environments, from isolation to cluster centers. We\nfind four super spiral galaxy systems that are late-stage major mergers--a\npossible clue to their formation. We suggest that super spirals are a remnant\npopulation of unquenched, massive disk galaxies. They may eventually become\nmassive lenticular galaxies after they are cut off from their gas supply and\ntheir disks fade.\n", "  We consider the inclusion of the most important vibrational modes in the\nquantisation of the dodecahedral $B=7$ Skyrmion. In contrast to a rigid body\nquantisation, this formalism allows a spin $\\frac{3}{2}$ state to lie below the\nspin $\\frac{7}{2}$ state, in agreement with experimental data. There is also a\nlow lying spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ state and two spin $\\frac{5}{2} $ states. We find\nthat the excited spin $\\frac{7}{2}$ state has a smaller root mean square charge\nradius than the other states. This prediction is an important signature of the\nSkyrme model, in conflict with more conventional nuclear models.\n", "  Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is common to most planetary environments, and\ncould play a key role in the chemistry of molecules relevant to abiogenesis\n(prebiotic chemistry). In this work, we explore the impact of UV light on\nprebiotic chemistry that might occur in liquid water on the surface of a planet\nwith an atmosphere. We consider effects including atmospheric absorption,\nattenuation by water, and stellar variability to constrain the UV input as a\nfunction of wavelength. We conclude that the UV environment would be\ncharacterized by broadband input, and wavelengths below 204 nm and 168 nm would\nbe shielded out by atmospheric CO2 and water, respectively. We compare this\nbroadband prebiotic UV input to the narrowband UV sources (e.g. mercury lamps)\noften used in laboratory studies of prebiotic chemistry, and explore the\nimplications for the conclusions drawn from these experiments. We consider as\ncase studies the ribonucleotide synthesis pathway of Powner et al (2009) and\nthe sugar synthesis pathway of Ritson et al (2012). Irradiation by narrowband\nUV light from a mercury lamp formed an integral component of these studies: we\nquantitatively explore the impact of more realistic UV input on the conclusions\nthat can be drawn from these experiments. Finally, we explore the constraints\nsolar UV input places on the buildup of prebiotically important feedstock\ngasses like CH4 and HCN. Our results demonstrate the importance of\ncharacterizing the wavelength dependence (action spectra) of prebiotic\nsynthesis pathways to determine how pathways derived under laboratory\nirradiation conditions will function under planetary prebiotic conditions.\n  Keywords: Laboratory Investigations; Origin of Life; Planetary Environments;\nUV Radiation; RNA World\n", "  A geometric formulation of Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) is presented.\nExperimental observables are given in terms of geometric invariants of the\nscalar sigma model sector such as the curvature of the scalar field manifold\n$\\mathcal M$. We show how the curvature can be measured experimentally via\nHiggs cross-sections, $W_L$ scattering, and the $S$ parameter. The one-loop\naction of HEFT is given in terms of geometric invariants of $\\mathcal M$. The\ndistinction between the Standard Model (SM) and HEFT is whether $\\mathcal M$ is\nflat or curved, not whether the scalars transform linearly or non-linearly\nunder the electroweak group.\n", "  Debris disks are usually thought to be gas-poor, the gas being dissipated by\naccretion or evaporation during the protoplanetary phase. HD141569A is a 5 Myr\nold star harboring a famous debris disk, with multiple rings and spiral\nfeatures. We present here the first PdBI maps of the 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1) gas\nand dust emission at 1.3 mm in this disk. The analysis reveals there is still a\nlarge amount of (primordial) gas extending out to 250 au, i. e. inside the\nrings observed in scattered light. HD141569A is thus a hybrid disk with a huge\ndebris component, where dust has evolved and is produced by collisions, with a\nlarge remnant reservoir of gas.\n", "  We characterize the nonlinear stage of modulational instability (MI) by\nstudying the long-time asymptotics of focusing nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS)\nequation on the infinite line with initial conditions that tend to constant\nvalues at infinity. Asymptotically in time, the spatial domain divides into\nthree regions: a far left field and a far right field, in which the solution is\napproximately equal to its initial value, and a central region in which the\nsolution has oscillatory behavior and is described by slow modulations of the\nperiodic traveling wave solutions of the focusing NLS equation. These results\ndemonstrate that the asymptotic stage of MI is universal, since the long-time\nbehavior of a large class of perturbations is described by the same asymptotic\nstate.\n", "  The Gaussianization transform has been proposed as a method to remove the\nissues of scale-dependent galaxy bias and nonlinearity from galaxy clustering\nstatistics, but these benefits have yet to be thoroughly tested for realistic\ngalaxy samples. In this paper, we test the effectiveness of the Gaussianization\ntransform for different galaxy types by applying it to realistic simulated blue\nand red galaxy samples. We show that in real space, the shapes of the\nGaussianized power spectra of both red and blue galaxies agree with that of the\nunderlying dark matter, with the initial power spectrum, and with each other to\nsmaller scales than do the statistics of the usual (untransformed) density\nfield. However, we find that the agreement in the Gaussianized statistics\nbreaks down in redshift space. We attribute this to the fact that red and blue\ngalaxies exhibit very different fingers of god in redshift space. After\napplying a finger-of-god compression, the agreement on small scales between the\nGaussianized power spectra is restored. We also compare the Gaussianization\ntransform to the clipped galaxy density field and find that while both methods\nare effective in real space, they have more complicated behaviour in redshift\nspace. Overall, we find that Gaussianization can be useful in recovering the\nshape of the underlying dark matter power spectrum to k ~ 0.5 h/Mpc and of the\ninitial power spectrum to k ~ 0.4 h/Mpc in certain cases at z = 0.\n", "  Atomic structure of single-crystalline black phosphorus was studied by high\nresolution synchrotron-based photoelectron diffraction (XPD). The results show\nthat the topmost phosphorene layer in the black phosphorus is slightly\ndisplaced compared to the bulk structure and presents a small contraction in\nthe direction perpendicular to the surface. Furthermore, the XPD results show\nthe presence of a small buckling among the surface atoms, in agreement with\npreviously reported scanning tunneling microscopy results. The contraction of\nthe surface layer added to the presence of the buckling indicates an uniformity\nin the size of the sp3 bonds between P atoms at the surface.\n", "  Three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, covering the spatial domain from\nhundreds of Schwarzschild radii to $2\\ \\mathrm{pc}$ around the central\nsupermassive black hole of mass $10^8 M_\\odot$, with detailed radiative cooling\nprocesses, are performed. Generically found is the existence of a significant\namount of shock heated, high temperature ($\\geq 10^8\\ \\mathrm{K}$) coronal gas\nin the inner ($\\leq 10^4 r_\\mathrm{sch}$) region. It is shown that the\ncomposite bremsstrahlung emission spectrum due to coronal gas of various\ntemperatures are in reasonable agreement with the overall ensemble spectrum of\nAGNs and hard X-ray background. Taking into account inverse Compton processes,\nin the context of the simulation-produced coronal gas, our model can readily\naccount for the wide variety of AGN spectral shape, which can now be understood\nphysically. The distinguishing feature of our model is that X-ray coronal gas\nis, for the first time, an integral part of the inflow gas and its observable\ncharacteristics are physically coupled to the concomitant inflow gas. One\nnatural prediction of our model is the anti-correlation between accretion disk\nluminosity and spectral hardness: as the luminosity of SMBH accretion disk\ndecreases, the hard X-ray luminosity increases relative to the UV/optical\nluminosity.\n", "  We measure the absolute magnitude, $H$, distribution, $dN(H) \\propto\n10^{\\alpha H}$ of the scattering Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) as a proxy for\ntheir size-frequency distribution. We show that the H-distribution of the\nscattering TNOs is not consistent with a single-slope distribution, but must\ntransition around $H_g \\sim 9$ to either a knee with a shallow slope or to a\ndivot, which is a differential drop followed by second exponential\ndistribution. Our analysis is based on a sample of 22 scattering TNOs drawn\nfrom three different TNO surveys, the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey\n(CFEPS, Petit et al. 2011), Alexandersen et al. (2014), and the Outer Solar\nSystem Origins Survey (OSSOS, Bannister et al. 2016), all of which provide well\ncharacterized detection thresholds, combined with a cosmogonic model for the\nformation of the scattering TNO population. Our measured absolute magnitude\ndistribution result is independent of the choice of cosmogonic model. Based on\nour analysis, we estimate that number of scattering TNOs is (2.4-8.3)$\\times\n10^5$ for $H_r < 12$. A divot $H$-distribution is seen in a variety of\nformation scenarios and may explain several puzzles in Kuiper Belt science. We\nfind that a divot $H$-distribution simultaneously explains the observed\nscattering TNO, Neptune Trojan, Plutino, and Centaur $H$-distributions while\nsimultaneously predicting a large enough scattering TNO population to act as\nthe sole supply of the Jupiter-Family Comets.\n", "  Recent high-resolution, near-infrared images of protoplanetary disks have\nshown that these disks often present spiral features. Spiral arms are among the\nstructures predicted decades ago by numerical simulations of disk-planet\ninteraction and thus it is tempting to suspect that planetary perturbers are\nresponsible for the observed signatures. However, such interpretation is not\nfree of problems. The spirals are found to have large pitch angles, and in at\nleast one case (HD 100546) the spiral feature appears effectively unpolarized,\nwhich implies thermal emission of the order of 1000K (465$\\pm$40K at closer\ninspection). We have recently shown in two-dimensional models that shock\ndissipation in the supersonic wake of high-mass planets can lead to significant\nheating if the disk is sufficiently adiabatic. In this paper we extend this\nanalysis to three dimensions in thermodynamically evolving disks. We use the\nPencil Code in spherical coordinates for our models, with a prescription for\nthermal cooling based on the optical depth of the local vertical gas column. We\nuse a 5$M_J$ planet, and show that shocks in the region around the planet where\nthe Lindblad resonances occur heat the gas to substantially higher temperatures\nthan the ambient disk gas at that radius. The gas is accelerated vertically\naway from the midplane by the shocks to form shock bores, and the gas falling\nback toward the midplane breaks up into a turbulent surf near the Lindblad\nresonances. This turbulence, although localized, has high $\\alpha$ values,\nreaching 0.05 in the inner Lindblad resonance, and 0.1 in the outer one. We\nalso find evidence that the disk regions heated up by the planetary shocks\neventually becomes superadiabatic, generating convection far from the planet's\norbit.\n", "  Entanglement is the resource to overcome the restriction of operations to\nLocal Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). The Maximally\nEntangled Set (MES) of states is the minimal set of n-partite pure states with\nthe property that any truly n-partite entangled pure state can be obtained\ndeterministically via LOCC from some state in this set. Hence, this set\ncontains the most useful states for applications. In this work we characterize\nthe MES for generic three qutrit states. Moreover, we analyze which generic\nthree qutrit states are reachable (and convertible) under LOCC transformations.\nTo this end we study reachability via separable operations (SEP), a class of\noperations that is strictly larger than LOCC. Interestingly, we identify a\nfamily of pure states that can be obtained deterministically via SEP but not\nvia LOCC. To our knowledge these are the first examples of transformations\namong pure states that can be implemented via SEP but not via LOCC.\n", "  We present new mid-infrared interferometric observations of the massive young\nstellar object IRAS 13481-6124, using VLTI/MIDI for spectrally-resolved,\nlong-baseline measurements (projected baselines up to $\\sim120$ m) and\nGSO/T-ReCS for aperture-masking interferometry in five narrow-band filters\n(projected baselines of $\\sim1.8-6.4$ m) in the wavelength range of $7.5-13$\n$\\mu$m. We combine these measurements with previously-published interferometric\nobservations in the $K$ and $N$ bands in order to assemble the largest\ncollection of infrared interferometric observations for a massive YSO to date.\nUsing a combination of geometric and radiative-transfer models, we confirm the\ndetection at mid-infrared wavelengths of the disk previously inferred from\nnear-infrared observations. We show that the outflow cavity is also detected at\nboth near- and mid-infrared wavelengths, and in fact dominates the mid-infrared\nemission in terms of total flux. For the disk, we derive the inner radius\n($\\sim1.8$ mas or $\\sim6.5$ AU at 3.6 kpc), temperature at the inner rim\n($\\sim1760$ K), inclination ($\\sim48$ deg) and position angle ($\\sim107$ deg).\nWe determine that the mass of the disk cannot be constrained without\nhigh-resolution observations in the (sub-)millimeter regime or observations of\nthe disk kinematics, and could be anywhere from $\\sim10^{-3}$ to $20$\nM$_\\odot$. Finally, we discuss the prospects of interpreting the spectral\nenergy distributions of deeply-embedded massive YSOs, and warn against\nattempting to infer disk properties from the SED.\n", "  Strong coupling phenomena, such as the like charged macroions attraction,\nopposite charged macroions repulsion, charge renormalization or charge\ninversion, are known to be mediated by multivalent counterions. Most theories\ntreat the counterions as point charges, and describe the system by a single\ncoupling parameter that measures the strength of the Coulomb interactions. In\nmany biological systems, the counterions are highly charged and have finite\nsizes and can be well-described by polyelectrolytes. The shapes and\norientations of these polymer counterions play a major role in the\nthermodynamics of these systems. In this work we apply a field theoretic\ndescription in the strong coupling regime to polyelectrolytes. We work out the\nspecial cases of rod-like polymer counterions confined by one and two charged\nwalls respectively. The effects of the geometry of the rod-like counterions and\nthe excluded volume of the walls on the density, pressure and the free energy\nof the rodlike counterions are discussed.\n", "  We propose a set of standard assumptions for the modelling of Class II and\nIII protoplanetary disks, which includes detailed continuum radiative transfer,\nthermo-chemical modelling of gas and ice, and line radiative transfer from\noptical to cm wavelengths. We propose new standard dust opacities for disk\nmodels, we present a simplified treatment of PAHs sufficient to reproduce the\nPAH emission features, and we suggest using a simple treatment of dust\nsettling. We roughly adjust parameters to obtain a model that predicts typical\nClass II T Tauri star continuum and line observations. We systematically study\nthe impact of each model parameter (disk mass, disk extension and shape, dust\nsettling, dust size and opacity, gas/dust ratio, etc.) on all continuum and\nline observables, in particular on the SED, mm-slope, continuum visibilities,\nand emission lines including [OI] 63um, high-J CO lines, (sub-)mm CO\nisotopologue lines, and CO fundamental ro-vibrational lines. We find that\nevolved dust properties (large grains) often needed to fit the SED, have\nimportant consequences for disk chemistry and heating/cooling balance, leading\nto stronger emission lines in general. Strong dust settling and missing disk\nflaring have similar effects on continuum observations, but opposite effects on\nfar-IR gas emission lines. PAH molecules can shield the gas from stellar UV\nradiation because of their strong absorption and negligible scattering\nopacities. The observable millimetre-slope of the SED can become significantly\nmore gentle in the case of cold disk midplanes, which we find regularly in our\nT Tauri models. We propose to use line observations of robust chemical tracers\nof the gas, such as O, CO, and H2, as additional constraints to determine some\nkey properties of the disks, such as disk shape and mass, opacities, and the\ndust/gas ratio, by simultaneously fitting continuum and line observations.\n", "  We use the stellar-mass-selected catalog from the Spitzer Large Area Survey\nwith Hyper-Suprime-Cam (SPLASH) in the COSMOS field to study the environments\nof galaxies via galaxy density and clustering analyses up to $z \\sim 2.5$. The\nclustering strength of quiescent galaxies exceeds that of star-forming\ngalaxies, implying that quiescent galaxies are preferentially located in more\nmassive halos. When using local density measurement, we find a clear positive\nquiescent fraction--density relation at $z < 1$, consistent with earlier\nresults. However, the quiescent fraction--density relation reverses its trend\nat intermediate redshifts ($1 < z < 1.5$) with marginal significance\n(<1.8$\\sigma$) and is found to be scale dependent (1.6$\\sigma$). The lower\nfraction of quiescent galaxies seen in large-scale dense environments, if\nconfirmed to be true, may be associated with the fact that the star formation\ncan be more easily sustained via cold stream accretion in `large-scale'\nhigh-density regions, preventing galaxies from permanent quenching. Finally, at\n$z > 1.5$, the quiescent fraction depends little on the local density, even\nthough clustering shows that quiescent galaxies are in more massive halos. We\nargue that at high redshift the typical halo size falls below $10^{13}$\n$M_{\\odot}$, where intrinsically the local density measurements are so varied\nthat they do not trace the halo mass. Our results thus suggest that in the\nhigh-redshift Universe, halo mass may be the key in quenching the star\nformation in galaxies, rather than the conventionally measured galaxy density.\n", "  PSR B0656+14 is a middle-aged pulsar with a characteristic age $\\tau_c=110$\nkyr and spin-down power $\\dot{E}= 3.8\\times 10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Using\nChandra data, we searched for a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and found evidence of\nextended emission in a 3.5-15 arcsec annulus around the pulsar, with a\nluminosity $L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV}^{\\rm ext} \\sim 8\\times 10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at\nthe distance of 288 pc), which is a fraction of $\\sim 0.05$ of the non-thermal\npulsar luminosity. If the extended emission is mostly due to a PWN, its X-ray\nefficiency, $\\eta_{\\rm pwn} = L_{\\rm 0.5-8\\,keV}^{\\rm ext}/\\dot{E} \\sim 2\\times\n10^{-6}$, is lower than those of most other known PWNe but similar to that of\nthe middle-aged Geminga pulsar. The small radial extent and nearly round shape\nof the putative PWN can be explained if the pulsar is receding (or approaching)\nin the direction close to the line of sight. The very soft spectrum of the\nextended emission ($\\Gamma\\sim 8$), much softer than those of typical PWNe,\ncould be explained by a contribution from a faint dust scattering halo, which\nmay dominate in the outer part of the extended emission.\n", "  Pebble accretion is a new mechanism to quickly grow the cores of planets. In\npebble accretion, gravity and gas drag conspire to yield large collisional\ncross sections for small particles in protoplanetary disks. However, before\npebble accretion commences, aerodynamical deflection may act to prevent\nplanetesimals from becoming large, because particles tend to follow gas\nstreamlines. We derive the planetesimal radius where pebble accretion is\ninitiated and determine the growth timescales of planetesimals by sweepup of\nsmall particles. We obtain the collision efficiency factor as the ratio of the\nnumerically-obtained collisional cross section to the planetesimal surface\narea, from which we obtain the growth timescales. Integrations are conducted in\nthe potential flow limit (steady, inviscid) and in the Stokes flow regime\n(steady, viscid). Only particles of stopping time $t_s \\ll t_X$ where\n$t_X\\approx10^3$ s experience aerodynamic deflection. Even in that case, the\nplanetesimal's gravity always ensures positive collision factors. The maximum\ngrowth timescale occurs typically at around $R\\approx100 \\ \\mathrm{km}$, but is\nless for colder disks, corresponding to interactions shifting to the Safronov\nfocusing regime. For particles $t_s \\gg t_X$ pebble accretion commences only\nafter this phase and is characterized by a steep drop in growth timescales.\nConsequently, at distances beyond ~10 AU sweepup growth timescales are always\nlonger than $10$ Myr, while in the inner disk (~<3 AU) the viability of the\nsweepup scenario is determined by the outcome of pebble-planetesimal collisions\nin the geometric regime. We present analytical fits for the collision\nefficiency factors and the minimum planetesimal size needed for pebble\naccretion. (Abridged)\n", "  Long-range thermal fluctuations appear in fluids in nonequilibrium states\nleading to fluctuation-induced Casimir-like forces. Two distinct mechanisms\nhave been identified for the origin of the long-range nonequilibrium\nfluctuations in fluids subjected to a temperature or concentration gradient.\nOne is a coupling between the heat or mass-diffusion mode with a viscous mode\nin fluids subjected to a temperature or concentration gradient. Another one is\nthe spatial inhomogeneity of thermal noise in the presence of a gradient. We\nshow that in fluids fluctuation-induced forces arising from mode coupling are\nseveral orders of magnitude larger than those from inhomogeneous noise.\n", "  We investigate axial quasi-normal modes of realistic neutron stars in\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity. We consider 8 realistic equations of\nstate containing nuclear, hyperonic, and hybrid matter. We focus on the\nfundamental curvature mode and compare the results with those of pure Einstein\ntheory. We observe that the frequency of the modes is increased by the presence\nof the Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton, while the impact on the damping time is typically\nsmaller. Interestingly, we obtain that universal relations valid in pure\nEinstein theory still hold for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton gravity, and we\npropose a method to use these phenomenological relations to constrain the value\nof the Gauss-Bonnet coupling.\n", "  In this paper we examine the constraints dedicated LHC multi lepton searches\ncan place on $Z'$ bosons coming from gauged muon number minus tau number,\n$L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$. As the $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ gauge boson does not couple to\nproton constituents or electrons at tree level, the current bounds are fairly\nloose, especially for $M_{Z'} \\gtrsim 1\\, \\rm GeV$. For $2m_{\\mu} < M_{Z'} <\nM_Z/2$ we develop search strategies using the $pp \\rightarrow Z \\to 4\\, \\mu$\nchannel. The cleanliness of the final state, combined with the fact that $pp\n\\to Z \\to 4 e$, $Z \\to 2e\\,2\\mu$ can be used as background control samples,\nallow us to spot $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ $Z'$ with couplings $\\mathcal O(10^{-3})$\ntimes the Standard Model couplings. For lighter $Z'$, we propose the mode $pp\n\\rightarrow 2\\mu + \\displaystyle{\\not} E_T$. The presence of missing energy\nmeans there is a wider set of backgrounds to consider in this final state, such\nas Drell-Yan production of leptonically decaying $\\tau$ pairs, however we find\nthese can be controlled with careful cuts. Combining the $4\\, \\mu$ and $2\\,\\mu\n+ \\displaystyle{\\not} E_T$ modes, we find that with $\\sim3 \\, \\text{ab}^{-1}$\nof integrated luminosity we are sensitive to couplings $g_{Z'} \\gtrsim 0.005\\,\ng_1$ and $0.5\\, \\rm GeV \\le M_{Z'} \\le 40\\, \\rm GeV$ and $g_{Z'} \\gtrsim\n0.001\\, g_1$ for $M_{Z'} < 2\\, m_{\\mu}$. This region includes the parameter\nspace where $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ models can ameliorate the muon $g-2$ anomaly. We\nrepeat these analyses at a future $e^+e^-$ Z-factory, where we find improved\nsensitivity. Specifically, given $2.6\\, \\rm ab^{-1}$ of luminosity, we can\nexclude $g_{Z'} \\gtrsim 0.001\\, g_1$ for $2\\, m_{\\mu} \\le M_{Z'} \\le M_Z/2$.\n", "  Young stars are surrounded by copious amounts of circumstellar material. Its\ncomposition, in particular its gas-to-dust ratio, is an important parameter.\nHowever, measuring this ratio is challenging, because gas mass estimates are\noften model dependent. X-ray absorption is sensitive to the gas along the\nline-of-sight while optical/near-IR extinction depends on the dust content.\nTherefore, the gas-to-dust ratio of an absorber is given by the ratio between\nX-ray and optical/near-IR extinction. We present three systems where we used\nX-ray and optical/near-IR data to constrain the gas-to-dust ratio of\ncircumstellar material; from a dust-rich debris disk to gaseous protoplanetary\ndisks.\n", "  We compute predictions for various low-transverse-momentum bulk observables\nin $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.023$ TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC from the\nevent-by-event next-to-leading-order perturbative-QCD + saturation + viscous\nhydrodynamics (\"EKRT\") model. In particular, we consider the centrality\ndependence of charged hadron multiplicity, flow coefficients of the\nazimuth-angle asymmetries and correlations of event-plane angles. The\ncentrality dependencies of the studied observables are predicted to be very\nsimilar to those at 2.76 TeV, and the magnitudes of the flow coefficients and\nevent-plane angle correlations are predicted to be close to those at 2.76 TeV.\nThe flow coefficients may, however, offer slightly more discriminating power on\nthe temperature dependence of QCD matter viscosity than the 2.76 TeV\nmeasurements. Our prediction for the multiplicity in the 0-5\\% centrality\nclass, obtained using the two temperature-dependent shear-viscosity-to-entropy\nratios that give the best overall fit to RHIC and LHC data is $dN_{\\rm\nch}/d\\eta\\big|_{|\\eta|\\le 0.5} =1876\\dots2046$. We also predict a power-law\nincrease from 200 GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC to 2.76 and 5.023 TeV Pb+Pb\ncollisions at the LHC, $dN_{\\rm ch}/d\\eta\\big|_{|\\eta|\\le 0.5} \\propto\ns^{0.164\\dots0.174}$.\n", "  Collective motions emerging from the interaction of autonomous mobile\nindividuals play a key role in many phenomena, from the growth of bacterial\ncolonies to the coordination of robotic swarms. For these collective behaviours\nto take hold, the individuals must be able to emit, sense and react to signals.\nWhen dealing with simple organisms and robots, these signals are necessarily\nvery elementary, e.g. a cell might signal its presence by releasing chemicals\nand a robot by shining light. An additional challenge arises because the motion\nof the individuals is often noisy, e.g. the orientation of cells can be altered\nby Brownian motion and that of robots by an uneven terrain. Therefore, the\nemphasis is on achieving complex and tunable behaviors from simple autonomous\nagents communicating with each other in robust ways. Here, we show that the\ndelay between sensing and reacting to a signal can determine the individual and\ncollective long-term behavior of autonomous agents whose motion is\nintrinsically noisy. We experimentally demonstrate that the collective\nbehaviour of a group of phototactic robots capable of emitting a radially\ndecaying light field can be tuned from segregation to aggregation and\nclustering by controlling the delay with which they change their propulsion\nspeed in response to the light intensity they measure. We track this transition\nto the underlying dynamics of this system, in particular, to the ratio between\nthe robots' sensorial delay time and the characteristic time of the robots'\nrandom reorientation. Supported by numerics, we discuss how the same mechanism\ncan be applied to control active agents, e.g. airborne drones, moving in a\nthree-dimensional space.\n", "  We generalize the concept of photonic gauge potential in real space, by\nintroducing an additional \"synthetic\" frequency dimension in addition to the\nreal space dimensions. As an illustration we consider a one-dimensional array\nof ring resonators, each supporting a set of resonant modes having a frequency\ncomb with spacing $\\Omega$, undergoing a refractive index modulation at the\nmodulation frequency equal to $\\Omega$. We show that the modulation phase\nprovides a gauge potential in the synthetic two-dimensional space with the\ndimensions being the frequency and the spatial axes. Such gauge potential can\ncreate a topologically protected one-way edge state in the synthetic space that\nis useful for high-efficiency generation of higher-order side bands.\n", "  We study the concavity of the dispersion relation $q\\mapsto\n\\omega\\_{\\mathbf{q}}$ of the bosonic excitations of a three-dimensional\nspin-$1/2$ Fermi gas in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). In the limit of\nsmall wave numbers $q$ we obtain analytically the spectrum up to order $5$ in\n$q$. In the neighborhood of $q=0$, a change in concavity between the convex BEC\nlimit and the concave BCS limit takes place at $\\Delta/\\mu\\simeq0.869$\n[$1/(k\\_F a)\\simeq-0.144$], where $a$ is the scattering length between opposite\nspin fermions, $k\\_F$ is the Fermi wave number and $\\Delta$ the gap according\nto BCS theory, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. At that point the branch is\nconcave due to a negative fifth-order term. Our results are supplemented by a\nnumerical study which shows the evolution of the border between the zone of the\n$(q,\\Delta)$ plane where $q\\mapsto \\omega\\_{\\mathbf{q}}$ is concave and the\nzone where it is convex.\n", "  The partially deuterated linear isomer HDCCC of the ubiquitous cyclic carbene\n($c$-C$_3$H$_2$) was observed in the starless cores TMC-1C and L1544 at 96.9\nGHz, and a confirming line was observed in TMC-1 at 19.38 GHz. To aid the\nidentification in these narrow line sources, four centimetre-wave rotational\ntransitions (two in the previously reported $K_a =0$ ladder, and two new ones\nin the $K_a =1$ ladder), and 23 transitions in the millimetre band between 96\nand 272 GHz were measured in high-resolution laboratory spectra. Nine\nspectroscopic constants in a standard asymmetric top Hamiltonian allow the\nprincipal transitions of astronomical interest in the $K_a \\le 3$ rotational\nladders to be calculated to within 0.1 km s$^{-1}$ in radial velocity up to 400\nGHz. Conclusive evidence for the identification of the two astronomical lines\nof HDCCC was provided by the $V_{\\rm{LSR}}$ which is the same as that of the\nnormal isotopic species (H$_2$CCC) in the three narrow line sources. In these\nsources, deuterium fractionation in singly substituted H$_2$CCC (HDCCC/H$_2$CCC\n$\\sim4\\%\\text{-}19\\%$) is comparable to that in $c$-C$_3$H$_2$\n($c$-C$_3$H$_2$/$c$-C$_3$HD $\\sim5\\%\\text{-}17\\%$), and similarly in doubly\ndeuterated $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ($c$-C$_3$D$_2$/$c$-C$_3$HD $\\sim3\\%\\text{-}17\\%$),\nimplying that the efficiency of the deuteration processes in the H$_2$CCC and\n$c$-C$_3$H$_2$ isomers are comparable in dark clouds.\n", "  To constrain the nature and fraction of the ionized gas outflows in AGNs, we\nperform a detailed analysis on gas kinematics as manifested by the velocity\ndispersion and shift of the [O III] {\\lambda}5007 emission line, using a large\nsample of ~39,000 type 2 AGNs at z<0.3. First, we confirm a broad correlation\nbetween [O III] and stellar velocity dispersions, indicating that the bulge\ngravitational potential plays a main role in determining the [O III]\nkinematics. However, [O III] velocity dispersion is on average larger than\nstellar velocity dispersion by a factor of 1.3-1.4 for AGNs with double\nGaussian [O III], suggesting that the non-gravitational component, i.e.,\noutflows, is almost comparable to the gravitational component. Second, the\nincrease of the [O III] velocity dispersion (after normalized by stellar\nvelocity dispersion) with both AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio suggests that\nnon-gravitational kinematics are clearly linked to AGN accretion. The\ndistribution in the [O III] velocity - velocity dispersion diagram dramatically\nexpands toward large values with increasing AGN luminosity, implying that the\nlaunching velocity of gas outflows increases with AGN luminosity. Third, the\nmajority of luminous AGNs presents the non-gravitational kinematics in the [O\nIII] profile. These results suggest that ionized gas outflows are prevalent\namong type 2 AGNs. On the other hand, we find no strong trend of the [O III]\nkinematics with radio luminosity, once we remove the effect of the bulge\ngravitational potential, indicating that ionized gas outflows are not directly\nrelated to radio activity for the majority of type 2 AGNs.\n", "  A novel two-leaflet description of lipid membranes is proposed. Within its\nframework, phase separation phenomena in multicomponent biological membranes\nare analyzed. As we show, interactions between the leaflets tend to suppress\nmacroscopic phase segregation (i.e., complete demixing of lipids) in such\nsystems. Instead, microphase separation characterized by formation of\nequilibrium nanoscale domains can take place. The phase diagram is constructed\nand numerical simulations revealing nanostructures of different morphology are\nperformed.\n", "  A means for precise experimental characterization of the dielectric\nsusceptibility of an atomic gas inside and optical cavity is important for\ndesign and operation of quantum light matter interfaces, particularly in the\ncontext of quantum information processing. Here we present a numerically\noptimised theoretical model to predict the spectral response of an atom-filled\ncavity, accounting for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening at high\noptical densities. We investigate the regime where the two broadening\nmechanisms are of similar magnitude, which makes the use of common\napproximations invalid. Our model agrees with an experimental implementation\nwith warm caesium vapour in a ring cavity. From the cavity response, we are\nable to extract important experimental parameters, for instance the ground\nstate populations, total number density and the magnitudes of both homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous broadening.\n", "  We derive the exact spectra as well as partition functions for a class of\n$BC_N$ type of spin Calogero models, whose Hamiltonians are constructed by\nusing supersymmetric analogues of polarized spin reversal operators (SAPSRO).\nThe strong coupling limit of these spin Calogero models yields $BC_N$ type of\nPolychronakos-Frahm (PF) spin chains with SAPSRO. By applying the freezing\ntrick, we obtain an exact expression for the partition functions of such PF\nspin chains. We also derive a formula which expresses the partition function of\nany $BC_N$ type of PF spin chain with SAPSRO in terms of partition functions of\nseveral $A_K$ type of supersymmetric PF spin chains, where $K\\leq N-1$.\nSubsequently we show that an extended boson-fermion duality relation is obeyed\nby the partition functions of the $BC_N$ type of PF chains with SAPSRO. Some\nspectral properties of these spin chains, like level density distribution and\nnearest neighbour spacing distribution, are also studied.\n", "  In 2014 an all-sky imager (ASI) and an Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter\nRadar consisting of 14 panels (AMISR-14) system were installed at the Jicamarca\nRadio Observatory. The ASI measures airglow depletions associated with\nlarge-scale equatorial spread F irregularities (10s-100s km), while AMISR-14\ndetects small-scale irregularities (0.34 m). This study presents simultaneous\nobservations of equatorial spread F (ESF) irregularities at 10-100 km scales\nusing the all sky-imager, at 3 m scales using the JULIA (Jicamarca Unattended\nLong-term Investigations of the Ionosphere and Atmosphere) radar, and at 0.34 m\nscales using the AMISR-14 radar. We compare data from the three instruments on\nthe night of 20-21 August, 2014 by locating the radar scattering volume in the\noptical images. During this night no topside plumes were observed, and we only\ncompare with bottomside ESF. AMISR-14 had five beams perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field covering ~200 km in the east-west direction at 250 km altitude.\nComparing the radar data with zenith ASI measurements, we found that most of\nthe echoes occur on the western wall of the depletions with fewer echoes\nobserved the eastern wall and center, contrary to previous comparisons of\ntopside plumes that showed most of the echoes in the center of depleted\nregions. We attribute these differences to the occurrence of irregularities\nproduced at sub-meter scales by the lower-hybrid-drift instability. Comparisons\nof the ASI observations with JULIA images show similar results to those found\nin the AMISR-14 and ASI comparison.\n", "  We present the results of mechanical characterizations of many different\nhigh-quality optical coatings made of ion-beam-sputtered titania-doped tantala\nand silica, developed originally for interferometric gravitational-wave\ndetectors. Our data show that in multi-layer stacks (like high-reflection Bragg\nmirrors, for example) the measured coating dissipation is systematically higher\nthan the expectation and is correlated with the stress condition in the sample.\nThis has a particular relevance for the noise budget of current advanced\ngravitational-wave interferometers, and, more generally, for any experiment\ninvolving thermal-noise limited optical cavities.\n", "  Strongly magnetized accretion discs around black holes have attractive\nfeatures that may explain enigmatic aspects of X-ray binary behaviour. The\nstructure and evolution of these discs are governed by a dynamo-like mechanism,\nwhich channels part of the accretion power liberated by the magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) into an ordered toroidal magnetic field. To study dynamo\nactivity, we performed three-dimensional, stratified, isothermal, ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic shearing box simulations. The strength of the\nself-sustained toroidal magnetic field depends on the net vertical magnetic\nflux, which we vary across almost the entire range over which the MRI is\nlinearly unstable. We quantify disc structure and dynamo properties as a\nfunction of the initial ratio of mid-plane gas pressure to vertical magnetic\nfield pressure, $\\beta_0^{\\rm mid} = p_{\\rm gas} / p_B$. For $10^5 \\geq\n\\beta_0^{\\rm mid} \\geq 10$ the effective $\\alpha$-viscosity parameter scales as\na power-law. Dynamo activity persists up to and including $\\beta_0^{\\rm mid} =\n10^2$, at which point the entire vertical column of the disc is magnetic\npressure-dominated. Still stronger fields result in a highly inhomogeneous disc\nstructure, with large density fluctuations. We show that the turbulent steady\nstate $\\beta^{\\rm mid}$ in our simulations is well-matched by the analytic\nmodel of Begelman et al. (2015) describing the creation and buoyant escape of\ntoroidal field, while the vertical structure of the disc can be broadly\nreproduced using this model. Finally, we discuss the implications of our\nresults for observed properties of X-ray binaries.\n", "  On March 28, 2011, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope triggered on an object\nthat had no analog in over six years of Swift operations. Follow-up\nobservations by the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) found a new, bright X-ray\nsource covering 3 orders of magnitude in flux over the first few days, that was\nmuch more persistent (and variable) than gamma-ray burst afterglows.\nGround-based spectroscopy found a redshift of 0.35, implying extremely high\nluminosity, with integrated isotropic-equivalent energy output in the X-ray\nband alone exceeding $10^{53}$ ergs in the first two weeks after discovery.\nStrong evidence for a collimated outflow or beamed emission was found. The\nobservational properties of this object are unlike anything ever before\nobserved. We interpret these unique properties as the result of emission from a\nrelativistic jet produced in the aftermath of the tidal disruption of a main\nsequence star by a massive black hole (BH) in the center of the host galaxy.\nThe source decayed slowly as the stellar remnants were accreted onto the BH,\nbefore abruptly shutting off. Here we present the definitive XRT team light\ncurve for Swift J164449.3+573451 and discuss its implications. We show that the\nunabsorbed flux decayed roughly as a $t^{-1.5}$ power law up to August 17,\n2012. The steep turnoff of an order of magnitude in 24 hours seems to be\nconsistent with the shutdown of the jet as the accretion disk transitioned from\na thick disk to a thin disk. Swift continues to monitor this source in case the\njet reactivates.\n", "  We obtain the non-equilibrium effective action of an inflaton like scalar\nfield --the system-- by tracing over sub Hubble degrees of freedom of\n\"environmental\" light scalar fields. The effective action is stochastic leading\nto effective Langevin equations of motion for the fluctuations of the\ninflaton-like field, with self-energy corrections and stochastic noise\ncorrelators that obey a de Sitter space-time analog of a fluctuation\ndissipation relation. We solve the Langevin equation implementing a dynamical\nrenormalization group resummation of the leading secular terms and obtain the\ncorrections to the power spectrum of super Hubble fluctuations of the inflaton\nfield, $\\mathcal{P}(k;\\eta) = \\mathcal{P}_0(k)\\,e^{-\\gamma(k;\\eta)}$ where\n$\\mathcal{P}_0(k)$ is the nearly scale invariant power spectrum in absence of\ncoupling. $\\gamma(k;\\eta)>0$ describes the suppression of the power spectrum,\nit features Sudakov-type double logarithms and entails violations of scale\ninvariance. We also obtain the effective action for the case of a heavy scalar\nfield of mass $ M \\gg H$, this case yields a local \"Fermi\" limit with a very\nweak self-interaction of the inflaton-like field and dissipative terms that are\nsuppressed by powers of $H/M$. We conjecture on the possibility that the large\nscale anomalies in the CMB may originate in dissipative processes from inflaton\ncoupling to sub-Hubble degrees of freedom.\n", "  Rapidly rotating, low-mass members of eclipsing binary systems have measured\nradii significantly larger than predicted by standard models. It has been\nproposed that magnetic activity is responsible for radius inflation. By\nestimating the radii of low-mass stars in three young clusters (NGC 2264, NGC\n2547, NGC 2516, with ages of 5, 35 and 140 Myr respectively), we aim to\nestablish whether similar radius inflation is seen in single, magnetically\nactive stars. We use radial velocities from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and\npublished photometry to establish cluster membership and combine GES\nmeasurements of vsini with published rotation periods to estimate average radii\nfor groups of fast-rotating cluster members as a function of their luminosity\nand age. The average radii are compared with the predictions of both standard\nevolutionary models and variants that include magnetic inhibition of convection\nand starspots. At a given luminosity, the stellar radii in NGC 2516 and NGC\n2547 are larger than predicted by standard evolutionary models at the ages of\nthese clusters. The discrepancy is least pronounced and not significant ~10\npercent) in ZAMS stars with radiative cores, but more significant in\nlower-mass, fully convective pre main-sequence cluster members, reaching\n30+/-10 percent. The uncertain age and distance of NGC 2264 preclude a reliable\ndetermination of any discrepancy for its members. The median radii we have\nestimated for low-mass fully convective stars in the older clusters are\ninconsistent (at the 2-3 sigma level) with non-magnetic evolutionary models and\nmore consistent with models that incorporate the effects of magnetic fields or\ndark starspots. The available models suggest this requires either surface\nmagnetic fields exceeding 2.5 kG, spots that block about 30 per cent of the\nphotospheric flux, or a more moderate combination of both. [Abridged]\n", "  We have studied two Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that occurred on September\n25 and 28, 2012 and interacted near the Earth. By fitting the Graduated\nCylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the SECCHI/COR2 images and applying the\nStereoscopic Self-Similar Expansion (SSSE) method on the SECCHI/HI images, the\ninitial direction of both the CMEs is estimated to be west of the Sun-Earth\nline. Further, the three-dimensional (3D) heliospheric kinematics of these CMEs\nhave been estimated using Self-Similar Expansion (SSE) reconstruction method.\nWe show that use of SSE method with different values of angular extent of the\nCMEs, leads to significantly different kinematics estimates for the CMEs\npropagating away from the observer. Using the estimated kinematics and true\nmasses of the CMEs, we have derived the coefficient of restitution for the\ncollision which is found to be close to elastic. The in situ measurements at 1\nAU show two distinct structures of interplanetary CMEs, heating of the\nfollowing CME, as well as ongoing interaction between the preceding and the\nfollowing CME. We highlight the signatures of interaction in remote and in situ\nobservations of these CMEs and the role of interaction in producing a major\ngeomagnetic storm.\n", "  We consider a sample of 107 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) for which early UV\nemission was measured by Swift, and extrapolate the photon intensity to lower\nenergies. Protons accelerated in the GRB jet may interact with such photons to\nproduce charged pions and subsequently ultra high energy neutrinos\n$\\varepsilon_\\nu\\geq 10^{16}$ eV. We use simple energy conversion efficiency\narguments to predict the maximal neutrino flux expected from each GRB. We\nestimate the neutrino detection rate at large area radio based neutrino\ndetectors and conclude that the early afterglow neutrino emission is too weak\nto be detected even by next generation neutrino observatories.\n", "  One of the necessary parameters needed for the interpretation of the light\ncurves of transiting exoplanets or eclipsing binaries, as well as\ninterferometric measurements of a star or microlensing events is how the\nintensity and polarization of a light change from the center to the limb.\nScattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect both the\ncenter-to limb variation of intensity (CLVI) and polarization (CLVP). In this\npaper, we present a study of the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra considering\ndifferent contributions of scattering and absorption opacity for different\nspectral type stars with spherical atmospheres. We solve the polarized\nradiative transfer equation in the presence of continuum scattering,\nconsidering spherical stellar model atmospheres. We developed two independent\ncodes based on Feautrier and short characteristics methods to cross-check our\nresults. We calculate the CLVI and CLVP in continuum for the Phoenix grid of\nspherical stellar model atmospheres for a range of $T_{eff} = 4000 - 7000 \\rm\nK$, $\\log g = 1.0 - 5.5$ and $\\lambda = 4000 - 7000 \\rm \\AA$, which are\ntabulated and available at the CDS. For sub-giant and dwarf stars ($\\log g =\n3.0 - 4.5$), lower $\\log g$ and lower $T_{eff}$ of a star lead to higher limb\npolarization of the star. For giant and supergiant stars ($\\log g = 1.0 -\n2.5$), the highest effective temperature yields the largest polarization. By\ndecreasing of the $T_{eff}$ of a star down to $4500 - 5500 \\rm K$ (depending on\n$\\log g$) the limb polarization decreases and reaches a local minimum. It\nincreases again down to $T_{eff}$ of $4000 \\rm K$. For the most compact dwarf\nstars ($\\log g = 5.0 - 5.5$) the limb polarization degree shows a maximum for\nmodels with $T_{eff}$ in the range $4200 - 4600 \\rm K$ (depending on $\\log g$)\nand decreases toward higher and lower temperatures.\n", "  The Lee-Wick Standard Model is a highly constrained model which solves the\ngauge hierarchy problem at the expense of including states with negative norm.\nIt appears to be macroscopically causal and consistent. This model is extended\nby considering the two-Higgs doublet extension of the Lee-Wick model. Rewriting\nthe Lagrangian using auxiliary fields introduces two additional doublets of\nLee-Wick partners. The model is highly constrained, with only one or two\nadditional parameters beyond that of the usual two-Higgs doublet model, and yet\nthere are four doublets. Mass relations are established by diagonalizing the\nmass matrices and further constraints are established by studying results from\nB --> tau nu, neutral B-meson mixing, and B --> X_s gamma. The prospects of\ndetecting evidence for this model at the LHC are discussed.\n", "  We consider collisions of particles near generic axially symmetric extremal\nblack holes. We examine possibility of indefinitely large extraction of energy\n(the so-called super-Penrose process) in the limit when the point of collision\napproaches the horizon. Three potential options are considered (fractional\npowers of the lapse function in the relations between the energies and the\nangular momenta of particles in the point of collision), collision between\noutgoing particles and ingoing ones, collision in the ergoregion far from the\nhorizon). It turns out in all three cases that states suitable for the\nsuper-Penrose process cannot be obtained from the previous collision of\nparticles with finite masses and angular momenta.\n", "  We propose a generalization of the superconducting circuit simulation of the\ndynamical Casimir effect where we consider relativistically moving boundary\nconditions following different trajectories. We study the feasibility of the\nsetup used in the past to simulate the dynamical Casimir effect to reproduce\nricher relativistic trajectories differing from purely sinusoidal ones. We show\nhow different relativistic oscillatory trajectories of the boundaries of the\nsame period and similar shape produce a rather different spectrum of particles\ncharacteristic of their respective motions.\n", "  The SCUSS is a deep $u$-band imaging survey in the south Galactic cap using\nthe 2.3m Bok telescope. The survey observations were completed in the end of\n2013, covering an area of about 5000 square degrees. We release the data in the\nregion with an area of about 4000 deg$^2$ that is mostly covered by the Sloan\ndigital sky survey. The data products contain calibrated single-epoch images,\nstacked images, photometric catalogs, and a catalog of star proper motions\nderived by Peng et al, 2015. The median seeing and magnitude limit ($5\\sigma$)\nare about 2\".0 and 23.2 mag, respectively. There are about 8 million objects\nhaving measurements of absolute proper motions. All the data and related\ndocumentations can be accessed through the SCUSS data release website of\n\\url{http://batc.bao.ac.cn/Uband/data.html}.\n", "  The possible existence of short-channel effects in oxide field-effect\ntransistors is investigated by exploring field-effect transistors with various\ngate lengths fabricated from LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ heterostructures. The studies\nreveal the existence of channel-length modulation and drain-induced barrier\nlowering for gate lengths below 1 {\\mu}m, with a characteristic behavior\ncomparable to semiconducting devices. With the fabrication of field-effect\ntransistors with gate lengths as small as 60 nm the results demonstrate the\npossibility to fabricate by electron-beam lithography functional devices based\non complex oxides with characteristic lengths of several ten nanometers.\n", "  We investigate Landau-Zener processes modeled by a two-level quantum system,\nwith its finite bias energy varied in time and in the presence of a single\nbroadened cavity mode at zero temperature. By applying the hierarchy equation\nmethod to the Landau-Zener problem, we computationally study the survival\nfidelity of adiabatic states without Born, Markov, rotating-wave or other\nperturbative approximations. With this treatment it also becomes possible to\ninvestigate cases with very strong system-bath coupling. Different from a\nprevious study of infinite-time Landau-Zener processes, the fidelity of the\ntime-evolving state as compared with instantaneous adiabatic states shows\nnon-monotonic dependence on the system-bath coupling and on the sweep rate of\nthe bias. We then consider the effect of applying a counter-diabatic driving\nfield, which is found to be useful in improving the fidelity only for\nsufficiently short Landau-Zener processes. Numerically exact results show that\ndifferent counter-diabatic driving fields can have much different robustness\nagainst environment effects. Lastly, using a case study we discuss the\npossibility of introducing a dynamical decoupling field in order to eliminate\nthe decoherence effect of the environment and at the same time to retain the\npositive role of a counter-diabatic field. Our work indicates that finite-time\nLandau-Zener processes with counter-diabatic driving offer a fruitful test bed\nto understand controlled adiabatic processes in open systems.\n", "  The early B-type star tau Sco exhibits an unusually complex, relatively weak\nsurface magnetic field. Its topology was previously studied with the Zeeman\nDoppler imaging (ZDI) modelling of high-resolution circular polarisation\n(Stokes V) observations. Here we assess the robustness of the Stokes V ZDI\nreconstruction of the magnetic field geometry of tau Sco and explore the\nconsequences of using different parameterisations of the surface magnetic maps.\nWe succeeded in reproducing previously published magnetic field maps of tau Sco\nusing both general harmonic expansion and a direct, pixel-based representation\nof the magnetic field. These maps suggest that the field topology of tau Sco is\ncomprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic\ncomponents. At the same time, we also found that available Stokes V\nobservations can be successfully fitted employing restricted harmonic\nexpansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether or linking the\nradial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by the\nwidely used potential field extrapolation technique. These alternative\nmodelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surface\nfield structure. The field distributions recovered with different ZDI options\ndiffer significantly, yielding indistinguishable Stokes V profiles but\ndifferent linear polarisation (Stokes Q and U) signatures. Our investigation\nunderscores the well-known problem of non-uniqueness of the Stokes V ZDI\ninversions. For the magnetic stars with properties similar to tau Sco\n(relatively complex field, slow rotation) the outcome of magnetic\nreconstruction depends sensitively on the adopted field parameterisation.\nStokes Q and U spectropolarimetric observations represent the only way of\nbreaking the degeneracy of surface magnetic field models.\n", "  Three mechanisms of capacitance enhance-ment by a magnetic field have been\nanalyz-ed. Through semiclassical description of charge movement under a\nmagnetic field, it can be shown that the charge density gradient, a term\ncoupled with magnetic field strength, could be used to augment the\nmagnetocapacitance. Also a magnetic field could enhance capacitance on the\npolarized metallic material surface due to the electron gas excitation.\nFinally, a magnetic field could produce oscillation in the capacitance when\nrelating the polarization with the magnetization through the modification of\nstandard free energy model. By deriving these three mechanisms, it can be seen\nthat three approaches are of potential for exploring tunable dielectric\nmaterials.\n", "  Measurements are presented of electroweak boson production using data from\n$pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8\\mathrm{\\,Te\\kern\n-0.1em V}$. The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of\n$2.0\\mathrm{\\,fb}^{-1}$ recorded with the LHCb detector. The bosons are\nidentified in the $W\\rightarrow\\mu\\nu$ and $Z\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay\nchannels. The cross-sections are measured for muons in the pseudorapidity range\n$2.0 < \\eta < 4.5$, with transverse momenta $p_{\\rm T} > 20{\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern\n-0.1em V\\!/}c}$ and, in the case of the $Z$ boson, a dimuon mass within $60 <\nM_{\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}} < 120{\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^{2}}$. The results are\n\\begin{align*} \\sigma_{W^{+}\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\nu} &= 1093.6 \\pm 2.1 \\pm 7.2\n\\pm 10.9 \\pm 12.7{\\rm \\,pb} \\, , \\sigma_{W^{-}\\rightarrow\\mu^{-}\\bar{\\nu}} &=\n\\phantom{0}818.4 \\pm 1.9 \\pm 5.0 \\pm \\phantom{0}7.0 \\pm \\phantom{0}9.5{\\rm\n\\,pb} \\, , \\sigma_{Z\\rightarrow\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}} &= \\phantom{00}95.0 \\pm 0.3 \\pm\n0.7 \\pm \\phantom{0}1.1 \\pm \\phantom{0}1.1{\\rm \\,pb} \\, , \\end{align*} where the\nfirst uncertainties are statistical, the second are systematic, the third are\ndue to the knowledge of the LHC beam energy and the fourth are due to the\nluminosity determination. The evolution of the $W$ and $Z$ boson cross-sections\nwith centre-of-mass energy is studied using previously reported measurements\nwith $1.0\\mathrm{\\,fb}^{-1}$ of data at $7\\mathrm{\\,Te\\kern -0.1em V}$.\nDifferential distributions are also presented. Results are in good agreement\nwith theoretical predictions at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative\nquantum chromodynamics.\n", "  We investigate electron transport through the interface between a niobium\nsuperconductor and the edge of a two-dimensional semimetal, realized in a 20~nm\nwide HgTe quantum well. Experimentally, we observe that typical behavior of a\nsingle Andreev contact is complicated by both a pronounced zero-bias resistance\nanomaly and shallow subgap resistance oscillations with $1/n$ periodicity.\nThese results are demonstrated to be independent of the superconducting\nmaterial and should be regarded as specific to a 2D semimetal in a proximity\nwith a superconductor. We interpret these effects to originate from the\nAndreev-like correlated process at the edge of a two-dimensional semimetal.\n", "  Photofission of actinides is studied in the region of nuclear excitation\nenergies that covers the entire giant dipole resonance (GDR) region. The mass\ndistributions of $^{238}$U photofission fragments have been explored\ntheoretically for eight different endpoint bremsstrahlung energies from 11.5\nMeV to 67.7 MeV which correspond to average photon energy of 9.09 MeV to 15.90\nMeV. Among these energies, the 29.1 MeV corresponds to the average photon\nenergy of 13.7$\\pm$0.3 MeV which coincides with GDR peak for $^{238}$U\nphotofission. The integrated yield of $^{238}$U photofission as well as charge\ndistribution of photofission products are calculated and its role in producing\nnuclei and their neutron-richness is investigated.\n", "  We analyze the impact of electric field and magnetic field fluctuations in\nthe decoherence of the electronic spin associated with a single\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond by engineering spin eigenstates\nprotected either against magnetic noise or against electric noise. The\ncompetition between these noise sources is analyzed quantitatively by changing\ntheir relative strength through modifications of the environment. This study\nprovides significant insights into the decoherence of the NV electronic spin,\nwhich is valuable for quantum metrology and sensing applications.\n", "  We report a high-field magnetotransport study on selected low-carrier\ncrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_{2-x}$Sb${_x}$Te$_{3-y}$Se$_{y}$.\nMonochromatic Shubnikov - de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed at 4.2~K and\ntheir two-dimensional nature is confirmed by tilting the magnetic field with\nrespect to the sample surface. With help of Lifshitz-Kosevich theory, important\ntransport parameters of the surface states are obtained, including the carrier\ndensity, cyclotron mass and mobility. For $(x,y)=(0.50,1.3)$ the Landau level\nplot is analyzed in terms of a model based on a topological surface state in\nthe presence of a non-ideal linear dispersion relation and a Zeeman term with\n$g_s = 70$ or $-54$. Input parameters were taken from the electronic dispersion\nrelation measured directly by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy on\ncrystals from the same batch. The Hall resistivity of the same crystal\n(thickness of 40~$\\mu$m) is analyzed in a two-band model, from which we\nconclude that the ratio of the surface conductance to the total conductance\namounts to 32~\\%.\n", "  As part of the Megamaser Cosmology Project (MCP), here we present a new\ngeometric distance measurement to the megamaser galaxy NGC 5765b. Through a\nseries of VLBI observations, we have confirmed the water masers trace a thin,\nsub-parsec Keplerian disk around the nucleus, implying an enclosed mass of 4.55\n$\\pm$ 0.40 $\\times~10^{7}M_\\odot$. Meanwhile, from single dish monitoring of\nthe maser spectra over two years, we measured the secular drifts of maser\nfeatures near the systemic velocity of the galaxy with rates between 0.5 and\n1.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. Fitting a warped, thin disk model to these\nmeasurements, we determine a Hubble Constant $H_{0}$ of 66.0 $\\pm$ 6.0 km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with the angular-diameter distance to NGC 5765b of 126.3\n$\\pm$ 11.6 Mpc.\n  Apart from the distance measurement, we also investigate some physical\nproperties related to the maser disk in NGC 5765b. The high-velocity features\nare spatially distributed into several clumps, which may indicate the existence\nof a spiral density wave associated with the accretion disk. For the\nred-shifted features, the envelope defined by the peak maser intensities\nincreases with radius. The profile of the systemic masers in NGC 5765b is\nsmooth and shows almost no structural changes over the two years of monitoring\ntime, which differs from the more variable case of NGC 4258.\n", "  The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was reactivated in December of\n2013 (NEOWISE) to search for potentially hazardous near-Earth objects. We have\nconducted a survey using the first sky pass of NEOWISE data and the AllWISE\ncatalog to identify nearby stars and brown dwarfs with large proper motions\n($\\mu_{\\rm total}$ $\\gtrsim$ 250 mas yr$^{-1}$). A total of 20,548 high proper\nmotion objects were identified, 1,006 of which are new discoveries. This survey\nhas uncovered a significantly larger sample of fainter objects (W2 $\\gtrsim$13\nmag) than the previous WISE motion surveys of Luhman (2014a) and Kirkpatrick et\nal. (2014). Many of these objects are predicted to be new L and T dwarfs based\non near- and mid-infrared colors. Using estimated spectral types along with\ndistance estimates, we have identified several objects likely belonging to the\nnearby Solar neighborhood (d $<$ 25 pc). We have followed up 19 of these new\ndiscoveries with near-infrared or optical spectroscopy, focusing on potentially\nnearby objects, objects with the latest predicted spectral types, and potential\nlate-type subdwarfs. This subset includes 6 M dwarfs, 5 of which are likely\nsubdwarfs, as well as 8 L dwarfs and 5 T dwarfs, many of which have blue\nnear-infrared colors. As an additional supplement, we provide 2MASS and AllWISE\npositions and photometry for every object found in our search, as well as\n2MASS/AllWISE calculated proper motions.\n", "  The annihilation of positrons in the Galaxy's interstellar medium produces\ncharacteristic gamma-rays with a line at 511 keV. This emission has been\nobserved with the spectrometer SPI on INTEGRAL, confirming a puzzling\nmorphology with bright emission from an extended bulge-like region, and faint\ndisk emission. Most plausible sources of positrons are believed to be\ndistributed throughout the disk of the Galaxy. We aim to constrain\ncharacteristic spectral shapes for different spatial components in the disk and\nbulge with the high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer SPI, based on a new\ninstrumental background method and detailed multi-component sky model fitting.\nWe confirm the detection of the main extended components of characteristic\nannihilation gamma-ray signatures at 58$\\sigma$ significance in the line. The\ntotal Galactic line intensity amounts to\n$(2.7\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-3}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ for our assumed spatial\nmodel. We derive spectra for the bulge and disk, and a central point-like and\nat the position of Sgr A*, and discuss spectral differences. The bulge shows a\n511 keV line intensity of\n$(0.96\\pm0.07)\\times10^{-3}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ and an\northo-positronium continuum equivalent to a positronium fraction of\n($1.08\\pm0.03$). The 2D-Gaussian representing the disk has an extent of\n$60^{+10}_{-5}$ deg in longitude and a latitudinal extent of\n$10.5^{+2.5}_{-1.5}$ deg; the line intensity is\n$(1.7\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-3}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ with a marginal detection\nof ortho-positronium and an overall diffuse Galactic continuum of\n$(5.85\\pm1.05)\\times10^{-5}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~keV^{-1}}$ at 511 keV.\nThe disk shows no flux asymmetry between positive and negative longitudes,\nalthough spectral details differ. The flux ratio between bulge and disk is\n($0.6\\pm0.1$). The central source has an intensity of\n$(0.8\\pm0.2)\\times10^{-4}~\\mathrm{ph~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$.\n", "  Stars form predominantly in groups usually denoted as clusters or\nassociations. The observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,\nsizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlying\nstructure in this diversity. Here we show that the assumption of an\nunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.\nCurrent data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,\nsize, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look\nat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to\nexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar\nneighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood\nthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of\nthe form $M_c = C R_c^{\\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds\nfor infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing\na hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The\ncorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to\nlow-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded\nclusters. We find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massive\nclumps as for the embedded star clusters. This might point at a direct\ntranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size\nmeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. Taking into\naccount multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an average\nstar-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood. The derived mass-radius relation gives constraints for the\ntheory of clustered star formation. Analytical models and simulations of\nclustered star formation have to reproduce this relation in order to be\nrealistic (abridged)\n", "  In this paper, we analyze a simple class of Horndeski scalar-tensor theory.\nWe investigate several cosmological solutions for inflation, bounce scenario\nand finite future-time singuarities. Perturbations respect to\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker metric are studied and discussed in the context of\ninflation.\n", "  We present a set of 109 new, high-precision Keck/HIRES radial velocity (RV)\nobservations for the solar-type star HD 32963. Our dataset reveals a candidate\nplanetary signal with a period of 6.49 $\\pm$ 0.07 years and a corresponding\nminimum mass of 0.7 $\\pm$ 0.03 Jupiter masses. Given Jupiter's crucial role in\nshaping the evolution of the early Solar System, we emphasize the importance of\nlong-term radial velocity surveys. Finally, using our complete set of Keck\nradial velocities and correcting for the relative detectability of synthetic\nplanetary candidates orbiting each of the 1,122 stars in our sample, we\nestimate the frequency of Jupiter analogs across our survey at approximately\n3%.\n", "  We study mono-W signals of dark matter (DM) production at the LHC, in the\ncontext of gauge invariant renormalizable models. We analyze two simplified\nmodels, one involving an s-channel Z' mediator and the other a t-channel\ncolored scalar mediator, and consider examples in which the DM-quark couplings\nare either isospin conserving or isospin violating after electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. While previous work on mono-W signals have focused on isospin\nviolating EFTs, obtaining very strong limits, we find that isospin violating\neffects are small once such physics is embedded into a gauge invariant\nsimplified model. We thus find that the 8 TeV mono-W results are much less\nconstraining than those arising from mono-jet searches. Considering both the\nleptonic (mono-lepton) and hadronic (mono fat jet) decays of the W, we\ndetermine the 14 TeV LHC reach of the mono-W searches with 3000 fb$^{-1}$ of\ndata. While a mono-W signal would provide an important complement to a mono-jet\ndiscovery channel, existing constraints on these models imply it will be a\nchallenging signal to observe at the 14 TeV LHC.\n", "  In order to characterize the distribution of molecular gas in spiral\ngalaxies, we study the line profiles of CO:1-0 emission in Andromeda, our\nnearest massive spiral galaxy. We compare observations performed with the IRAM\n30m single-dish telescope and with the CARMA interferometer at a common\nresolution of 23 arcsec ~ 85pc x 350pc and 2.5 km/s. When fitting a single\nGaussian component to individual spectra, the line profile of the single dish\ndata is a factor 1.5+-0.4 larger than the interferometric data one. This ratio\nin line widths is surprisingly similar to the ratios previously observed in two\nother nearby spirals, NGC 4736 and NGC 5055, but measured at ~0.5-1 kpc spatial\nscale. In order to study the origin of the different line widths, we stack the\nindividual spectra in 5 bins of increasing peak intensity and fit two Gaussian\ncomponents to the stacked spectra. We find a unique narrow component of FWHM =\n7.5+-0.4 km/s visible in both the single dish and the interferometric data. In\naddition, a broad component with FWHM = 14.4+-1.5 km/s is present in the\nsingle-dish data, but cannot be identified in the interferometric data. We\ninterpret this additional broad line width component detected by the single\ndish as a low brightness molecular gas component that is extended on spatial\nscales >0.5 kpc, and thus filtered out by the interferometer. We search for\nevidence of line broadening by stellar feedback across a range of star\nformation rates but find no such evidence on ~100 pc spatial scale when\ncharacterizing the line profile by a single Gaussian component.\n", "  Aims: We study the effects of the cosmological assembly history on the\nchemical and dynamical properties of the discs of spiral galaxies as a function\nof radius. Methods: We make use of the simulated Milky-Way mass,\nfully-cosmological discs, from {\\tt RaDES} (Ramses Disc Environment Study). We\nanalyse their assembly history by examining the proximity of satellites to the\ngalactic disc, instead of their merger trees, to better gauge which satellites\nimpact the disc. We present stellar age and metallicity profiles,\nAge-Metallicity Relation (AMR), Age-Velocity dispersion Relation (AVR), and\nStellar Age Distribution (SAD) in several radial bins for the simulated\ngalaxies. Results: Assembly histories can be divided into three different\nstages: i) a merger dominated phase, when a large number of mergers with mass\nratios of $\\sim$1:1 take place (lasting $\\sim$3.2$\\pm$0.4 Gyr on average); ii)\na quieter phase, when $\\sim$1:10 mergers take place (lasting $\\sim$4.4$\\pm$2.0\nGyr) - these two phases are able to kinematically heat the disc and produce a\ndisc that is chemically mixed over its entire radial extension; iii) a\n\"secular\" phase where the few mergers that take place have mass ratios below\n1:100, and which do not affect the disc properties (lasting $\\sim$5.5$\\pm$2.0\nGyr). Phase ii ends with a final merger event (at time $t_\\mathrm{jump}$)\nmarking the onset of important radial differences in the AMR, AVR, and SAD.\nConclusions: Inverted AMR trends in the outer parts of discs, for stars younger\nthan $t_\\mathrm{jump}$, are found as the combined effect of radial motions and\nstar formation in satellites temporarily located in these outer parts.\n\"U-shaped\" stellar age profiles change to an old plateau ($\\sim$10 Gyr) in the\nouter discs for the entire {\\tt RaDES} sample. This shape is a consequence of\ninside-out growth of the disc, radial motions of disc stars ... [abridged]\n", "  Recent experiments have demonstrated the efficacy of chiral helically shaped\nmolecules in polarizing the scattered electron spin, an effect termed as\nchiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). Here we solve a simple tight-binding\nmodel for electron transport through a single helical molecule, with spin-orbit\ninteractions on the bonds along the helix. Quantum interference is introduced\nvia additional electron hopping between neighboring sites in the direction of\nthe helix axis. When the helix is connected to two one-dimensional single-mode\nleads, time-reversal symmetry prevents spin polarization of the outgoing\nelectrons. One possible way to retrieve such a polarization is to allow leakage\nof electrons from the helix to the environment, via additional outgoing leads.\nTechnically, the leakage generates complex site self-energies, which break\nunitarity. As a result, the electron waves in the helix become evanescent, with\ndifferent decay lengths for different spin polarizations, yielding a net spin\npolarization of the outgoing electrons, which increases with the length of the\nhelix (as observed experimentally). A maximal polarization can be measured at a\nfinite angle away from the helix axis.\n", "  We aim to understand the contribution of the ionized, atomic and molecular\nphases of the ISM to the [CII] emission from clouds near the dynamical center\nand the BCLMP302 HII region in the north of the nearby galaxy M33 at a spatial\nresolution of 50pc. We combine high resolution [CII] spectra taken with the\nHIFI spectrometer onboard the Herschel satellite with [CII] Herschel-PACS maps\nand ground-based observations of CO(2-1) and HI. All data are at a common\nspatial resolution of 50pc. Typically, the [CII] lines have widths intermediate\nbetween the narrower CO(2-1) and broader HI line profiles. We decomposed the\n[CII] spectra in terms of contribution from molecular and atomic gas detected\nin CO(2-1) and HI, respectively. We find that the relative contribution of\nmolecular and atomic gas traced by CO(2-1) and HI varies depends mostly on the\nlocal physical conditions and geometry. We estimate that 11-60% and 5-34% of\nthe [CII] intensities in the center and in BCLMP302, respectively, arise at\nvelocities showing no CO(2-1) or HI emission and could arise in CO-dark\nmolecular gas. The deduced strong variation in the [CII] emission not\nassociated with CO and HI cannot be explained in terms of differences in A_v,\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field, and metallicity between the two studied\nregions. Hence the relative amounts of diffuse (CO-dark) and dense molecular\ngas possibly vary on spatial scales smaller than 50pc. Based on the emission\nmeasure observed at radio wavelengths we estimate the contribution of ionized\ngas at a few positions to lie between 10-25%. The correlations between the\nintensities of tracers corresponding to the same velocity range as [CII],\ndiffer from the correlation derived from PACS data. The results in this paper\nemphasize the need for velocity-resolved observations to discern the\ncontribution of different components of the ISM to [CII] emission. (abridged)\n", "  The interaction between a supersonic stellar wind and a (super-)sonic\ninterstellar wind has recently been viewed with new interest. We here first\ngive an overview of the modeling, which includes the heliosphere as an example\nof a special astrosphere. Then we concentrate on the shock structures of fluid\nmodels, especially of hydrodynamic (HD) models. More involved models taking\ninto account radiation transfer and magnetic fields are briefly sketched. Even\nthe relatively simple HD models show a rich shock structure, which might be\nobservable in some objects. We employ a single fluid model to study these\ncomplex shock structures, and compare the results obtained including heating\nand cooling with results obtained without these effects. Furthermore, we show\nthat in the hypersonic case valuable information of the shock structure can be\nobtained from the Rankine-Hugoniot equations. We solved the Euler equations for\nthe single fluid case and also for a case including cooling and heating. We\nalso discuss the analytical Rankine-Hugoniot relations and their relevance to\nobservations. We show that the only obtainable length scale is the termination\nshock distance. Moreover, the so-called thin shell approximation is usually not\nvalid. We present the shock structure in the model that includes heating and\ncooling, which differs remarkably from that of a single fluid scenario in the\nregion of the shocked interstellar medium. We find that the heating and cooling\nis mainly important in this region and is negligible in the regions dominated\nby the stellar wind beyond an inner boundary.\n", "  We present the Runaways and Isolated O-Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the\nSMC (RIOTS4), a spatially complete survey of uniformly selected field OB stars\nthat covers the entire star-forming body of the SMC. Using the IMACS multislit\nspectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes, we\nobtained spectra of 374 early-type field stars that are at least 28 pc from any\nother OB candidates. We also obtained spectra of an additional 23 field stars\nin the SMC bar identified from slightly different photometric criteria. Here,\nwe present the observational catalog of stars in the RIOTS4 survey, including\nspectral classifications and radial velocities. For three multi-slit fields\ncovering 8% of our sample, we carried out monitoring observations over 9-16\nepochs to study binarity, finding a spectroscopic, massive binary frequency of\nat least $\\sim$60% in this subsample. Classical Oe/Be stars represent a large\nfraction of RIOTS4 (42%), occurring at much higher frequency than in the\nGalaxy, consistent with expectation at low metallicity. RIOTS4 confirmed a\nsteep upper IMF in the field, apparently caused by the inability of the most\nmassive stars to form in the smallest clusters. Our survey also yields evidence\nfor in-situ field OB star formation, and properties of field emission-line star\npopulations, including sgB[e] stars and classical Oe/Be stars. We also discuss\nthe radial velocity distribution and its relation to SMC kinematics and runaway\nstars. RIOTS4 presents a first quantitative characterization of field OB stars\nin an external galaxy, including the contributions of sparse, but normal, star\nformation; runaway stars; and candidate isolated star formation.\n", "  X-ray observations of pre-main sequence (pre-MS) stars of M-type probe\ncoronal emission and offer a means to investigate magnetic activity at the\nstellar-substellar boundary. Recent observations of main sequence (MS) stars at\nthis boundary display a decrease in fractional X-ray luminosity\n($L_{X}$/$L_{bol}$) by almost two orders of magnitude for spectral types M7 and\nlater. We investigate magnetic activity and search for a decrease in X-ray\nemission in the pre-MS progenitors of these MS stars. We present XMM-Newton\nX-ray observations and preliminary results for ~10 nearby (30-70 pc), very low\nmass pre-MS stars in the relatively unexplored age range of 10-30 Myr. We\ncompare the fractional X-ray luminosities of these 10-30 Myr old stars to\nyounger (1-3 Myr) pre-MS brown dwarfs and find no dependence on spectral type\nor age suggesting that X-ray activity declines at an age later than ~30 Myr in\nthese very low-mass stars.\n", "  We investigate whether or not the low ionisation fractions in molecular cloud\ncores can solve the `magnetic braking catastrophe', where magnetic fields\nprevent the formation of circumstellar discs around young stars. We perform\nthree-dimensional smoothed particle non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulations of the gravitational collapse of one solar mass molecular cloud\ncores, incorporating the effects of ambipolar diffusion, Ohmic resistivity and\nthe Hall effect alongside a self-consistent calculation of the ionisation\nchemistry assuming 0.1 micron grains. When including only ambipolar diffusion\nor Ohmic resistivity, discs do not form in the presence of strong magnetic\nfields, similar to the cases using ideal MHD. With the Hall effect included,\ndisc formation depends on the direction of the magnetic field with respect to\nthe rotation vector of the gas cloud. When the vectors are aligned, strong\nmagnetic braking occurs and no disc is formed. When the vectors are\nanti-aligned, a disc with radius of 13AU can form even in strong magnetic when\nall three non-ideal terms are present, and a disc of 38 AU can form when only\nthe Hall effect is present; in both cases, a counter-rotating envelope forms\naround the first hydrostatic core. For weaker, anti-aligned fields, the Hall\neffect produces massive discs comparable to those produced in the absence of\nmagnetic fields, suggesting that planet formation via gravitational instability\nmay depend on the sign of the magnetic field in the precursor molecular cloud\ncore.\n", "  Eight pulsars have low braking indices, which challenge the magnetic dipole\nbraking of pulsars. 222 pulsars and 15 magnetars have abnormal distribution of\nfrequency second derivatives, which also make contradiction with classical\nunderstanding. How neutron star magnetospheric activities affect these two\nphenomena are investigated by using the wind braking model of pulsars. It is\nbased on the observational evidence that pulsar timing is correlated with\nemission and both aspects reflect the magnetospheric activities. Fluctuations\nare unavoidable for a physical neutron star magnetosphere. Young pulsars have\nmeaningful braking indices, while old pulsars' and magnetars' fluctuation item\ndominates their frequency second derivatives. It can explain both the braking\nindex and frequency second derivative of pulsars uniformly. The braking indices\nof eight pulsars are the combined effect of magnetic dipole radiation and\nparticle wind. During the life time of a pulsar, its braking index will evolve\nfrom three to one. Pulsars with low braking index may put strong constraint on\nthe particle acceleration process in the neutron star magnetosphere. The effect\nof pulsar death should be considered during the long term rotational evolution\nof pulsars. An equation like the Langevin equation for Brownian motion was\nderived for pulsar spin-down. The fluctuation in the neutron star magnetosphere\ncan be either periodic or random, which result in anomalous frequency second\nderivative and they have similar results. The magnetospheric activities of\nmagnetars are always stronger than those of normal pulsars.\n", "  Strain engineering is one of the most promising and effective routes toward\ncontinuously tuning the electronic and optic properties of materials, while\nthermal properties are generally believed to be insensitive to mechanical\nstrain. In this paper, the strain-dependent thermal conductivity of monolayer\nsilicene under uniform bi-axial tension is computed by solving the phonon\nBoltzmann transport equation with force constants extracted from\nfirst-principles calculations. Unlike the commonly believed understanding that\nthermal conductivity only slightly decreases with increased tensile strain for\nbulk materials, it is found that the thermal conductivity of silicene first\nincreases dramatically with strain and then slightly decreases when the applied\nstrain increases further. At a tensile strain of 4%, the highest thermal\nconductivity is found to be about 7.5 times that of unstrained one. Such an\nunusual strain dependence is mainly attributed to the dramatic enhancement in\nthe acoustic phonon lifetime. Such enhancement plausibly originates from the\nflattening of the buckling of the silicene structure upon stretching, which is\nunique for silicene as compared with other common two-dimensional materials.\nOur findings offer perspectives of modulating the thermal properties of\nlow-dimensional structures for applications such as thermoelectrics, thermal\ncircuits, and nanoelectronics.\n", "  The recent discovery of impulsive solar burst emission in the 30 THz band is\nraising new interpretation challenges. One event associated with a GOES M2\nclass flare has been observed simultaneously in microwaves, H-alpha, EUV, and\nsoft X-ray bands. Although these new observations confirm some features found\nin the two prior known events, they exhibit time profile structure\ndiscrepancies between 30 THz, microwaves, and hard X-rays (as inferred from the\nNeupert effect). These results suggest a more complex relationship between 30\nTHz emission and radiation produced at other wavelength ranges. The multiple\nfrequency emissions in the impulsive phase are likely to be produced at a\ncommon flaring site lower in the chromosphere. The 30 THz burst emission may be\neither part of a nonthermal radiation mechanism or due to the rapid thermal\nresponse to a beam of high-energy particles bombarding the dense solar\natmosphere.\n", "  We study the lepton flavor violating process, $e+ T \\to \\tau +T'$, at a few\nGeV. This process can be studied by experiments directing GeV scale electron or\npositron beams on internal or fixed targets. We study the effects of some low\nenergy lepton flavor violating interactions on this process. We study the\nsensitivities of this process on these low energy lepton flavor violating\ninteractions and compare them to the sensitivities of lepton flavor violating\n$\\tau$ decay processes. Comparing with $\\tau$ decay processes, this process\nprovides another way to study the lepton flavor violating effects with $e-\\tau$\nconversion and it can be searched for in facilities with GeV scale electron or\npositron beams which are available in a number of laboratories in the world.\n", "  Rotational evolution in young stars is described by pMS evolutionary tracks\nincluding rotation, conservation of angular momentum (AM), and simulations of\ndisk-locking (DL). By assuming that DL is the regulation mechanism for the\nstellar angular velocity during the early stages of pMS, we use our models and\nobservational data to constrain disk lifetimes (Tdisk) of a sample of low-mass\nstars in the ONC and NGC2264. The period distributions of the ONC and NGC2264\nare bimodal and depend on the stellar mass. To follow the rotational evolution\nof these two clusters' stars, we generated some sets of evolutionary tracks. We\nassumed that the evolution of fast rotators can be modeled by considering\nconservation of AM during all stages and of moderate rotators by considering\nconservation of angular velocity during the first stages of evolution. With\nthese models we estimate a mass and an age for all stars. For the ONC, we\nassume that the secondary peak in the period distribution is due to high-mass\nobjects locked in their disks, with a locking period (Plock) of ~8 days. For\nNGC2264 we make two hypotheses: (1) the stars in the secondary peak are locked\nwith Plock=5 days, and (2) NGC2264 is in a later stage in the rotational\nevolution (this implies in a DL scenario with Plock=8 days, a Tdisk of 1 Myr\nand, after that, constant AM evolution). We simulated the period distribution\nof NGC2264 when its mean age was 1 Myr. Dichotomy and bimodality appear in the\nsimulated distribution, presenting one peak at 2 days and another one at 5-7\ndays, indicating that the assumption of Plock=8 days is plausible. Our\nhypotheses are compared with observational disk diagnoses available in the\nliterature. DL models with Plock=8 days and 0.2 Myr<=Tdisk<=3 Myr are\nconsistent with observed periods of moderate rotators of the ONC. For NGC2264,\nhyphotesis 2 is the more promising explanation for its period distribution.\n", "  Hydrogen-rich compounds have been extensively studied both theoretically and\nexperimentally in the quest for novel high-temperature superconductors. Reports\non sulfur-hydride attaining metallicity under pressure and exhibiting\nsuperconductivity at temperatures as high as 200 K have spurred an intense\nsearch for room-temperature superconductors in hydride materials. Recently,\ncompressed phosphine was reported to metallize at pressures above 45 GPa,\nreaching a superconducting transition temperature (T$_{c}$) of 100 K at 200\nGPa. However, neither the exact composition nor the crystal structure of the\nsuperconducting phase have been conclusively determined. In this work the phase\ndiagram of PH$_n$ ($n=1,2,3,4,5,6$) was extensively explored by means of {\\it\nab initio} crystal structure predictions using the Minima Hopping Method (MHM).\nThe results do not support the existence of thermodynamically stable PH$_n$\ncompounds, which exhibit a tendency for elemental decomposition at high\npressure even when vibrational contributions to the free energies are taken\ninto account. Although the lowest energy phases of PH$_{1,2,3}$ display\nT$_{c}$'s comparable to experiments, it remains uncertain if the measured\nvalues of T$_{c}$ can be fully attributed to a phase-pure compound of PH$_n$.\n", "  We report discovery of a luminous F-type post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB)\nstar in the Galactic globular cluster (GC) M79 (NGC 1904). At visual apparent\nand absolute magnitudes of V=12.20 and Mv=-3.46, this \"yellow\" PAGB star is by\na small margin the visually brightest star known in any GC. It was identified\nusing CCD observations in the uBVI photometric system, which is optimized to\ndetect stars with large Balmer discontinuities, indicative of very low surface\ngravities. Follow-up observations with the SMARTS 1.3- and 1.5-m telescopes\nshow that the star is not variable in light or radial velocity, and that its\nvelocity is consistent with cluster membership. Near- and mid-infrared\nobservations with 2MASS and WISE show no evidence for circumstellar dust. We\nargue that a sharp upper limit to the luminosity function exists for yellow\nPAGB stars in old populations, making them excellent candidates for Population\nII standard candles, which are four magnitudes brighter than RR Lyrae\nvariables. Their luminosities are consistent with the stars being in a PAGB\nevolutionary phase, with core masses of ~0.53 Msun.\n  We also detected four very hot stars lying above the horizontal branch\n(\"AGB-manqu'e\" stars); along with the PAGB star, they are the brightest objects\nin M79 in the near ultraviolet. In an Appendix, we give periods and light\ncurves for five variables in M79: three RR Lyrae stars, a Type II Cepheid, and\na semiregular variable.\n", "  Studies of pre-transitional disks, with a gap region between the inner\ninfrared-emitting region and the outer disk, are important to improving our\nunderstanding of disk evolution and planet formation. Previous infrared\ninterferometric observations have shown hints of a gap region in the\nprotoplanetary disk around the Herbig Ae star HD~144432. We study the dust\ndistribution around this star with two-dimensional radiative transfer modeling.\nWe compare the model predictions obtained via the Monte-Carlo radiative\ntransfer code RADMC-3D with infrared interferometric observations and the\n{\\SED} of HD~144432. The best-fit model that we found consists of an inner\noptically thin component at $0.21\\enDash0.32~\\AU$ and an optically thick outer\ndisk at $1.4\\enDash10~\\AU$. We also found an alternative model in which the\ninner sub-AU region consists of an optically thin and an optically thick\ncomponent. Our modeling suggests an optically thin component exists in the\ninner sub-AU region, although an optically thick component may coexist in the\nsame region. Our modeling also suggests a gap-like discontinuity in the disk of\nHD~144432.\n", "  Generating spintronic devices has been a goal for the nano-science. We have\nused density function theory to determine magnetic phases of single layer and\nbilayer lithium doped graphene nanoflakes. We have introduced graphene flakes\nas single molecular magnets, spin on/off switches and spintronic memory\ndevices. To aim this goal, adsorption energies, spin polarizations, electronic\ngaps, magnetic properties and robustness of spin-polarized states have been\nstudied in the presence of dopants and second layers. We find that for bilayer\nSMMs with two layers of different sizes the highest occupied molecular orbital\nand the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital switch between the layers. Based on\nthis switch of molecular orbitals in a bilayer graphene SMM, spin on/off\nswitches and spintronic memory devices could be achievable.\n", "  This paper presents an estimate for the spectral properties of the stochastic\nbackground of gravitational waves emitted by a population of hot, young,\nrapidly rotating neutron stars throughout the Universe undergoing $f$-mode\ninstabilities, formed through either core-collapse supernova explosions or the\nmerger of binary neutron star systems. Their formation rate, from which the\ngravitational wave event rate is obtained, is deduced from observation-based\ndeterminations of the cosmic star formation rate. The gravitational wave\nemission occurs during the spin-down phase of the $f$-mode instability. For low\nmagnetized neutron stars and assuming 10\\% of supernova events lead to $f$-mode\nunstable neutron stars, the background from supernova-derived neutron stars\npeaks at $\\Omega_{\\text{gw}} \\sim 10^{-9}$ for the $l=m=2$ $f$-mode, which\nshould be detectable by cross-correlating a pair of second generation\ninterferometers (e.g. Advanced LIGO/Virgo) with an upper estimate for the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of $\\approx$ 9.8. The background from supramassive\nneutron stars formed from binary mergers peaks at $\\Omega_{\\text{gw}} \\sim\n10^{-10}$ and should not be detectable, even with third generation\ninterferometers (e.g. Einstein Telescope).\n", "  Weyl semimetals constitute a newly discovered class of three-dimensional\ntopological materials with linear touchings of valence and conduction bands in\nthe bulk. The most striking property of topological origin in these materials,\nso far unequivocally observed only in photoemission experiments, is the\npresence of open constant-energy contours at the boundary --- the so-called\nFermi arcs. In this work, we establish the universal characteristics of\nFermi-arc contributions to surface quasiparticle interference. Using a general\nphenomenological model, we determine the defining interference patterns\nstemming from the existence of Fermi arcs in a surface band structure. We then\ntrace these patterns in both simple tight-binding models and realistic ab\ninitio calculations. Our results show that definitive signatures of Fermi arcs\ncan be observed in existing and proposed Weyl semimetals using scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  We develop the perturbation theory of double field theory around arbitrary\nsolutions of its field equations. The exact gauge transformations are written\nin a manifestly background covariant way and contain at most quadratic terms in\nthe field fluctuations. We expand the generalized curvature scalar to cubic\norder in fluctuations and thereby determine the cubic action in a manifestly\nbackground covariant form. As a first application we specialize this theory to\ngroup manifold backgrounds, such as $SU(2) \\simeq S^3$ with $H$-flux. In the\nfull string theory this corresponds to a WZW background CFT. Starting from\nclosed string field theory, the cubic action around such backgrounds has been\ncomputed before by Blumenhagen, Hassler and L\\\"ust. We establish precise\nagreement with the cubic action derived from double field theory. This result\nconfirms that double field theory is applicable to arbitrary curved background\nsolutions, disproving assertions in the literature to the contrary.\n", "  We present the newly developed broadband transient monitor using the Swift\nBurst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the MAXI Gas Slit Camera (GSC) data. Our\nbroadband transient monitor monitors high energy transient sources from 2 keV\nto 200 keV in seven energy bands by combining the BAT (15-200 keV) and the GSC\n(2-20 keV) data. Currently, the daily and the 90-minute (one orbit) averaged\nlight curves are available for 106 high energy transient sources. Our broadband\ntransient monitor is available to the public through our web server,\nhttp://yoshidalab.mydns.jp/bat_gsc_trans_mon/, for a wider use by the\ncommunity. We discuss the daily sensitivity of our monitor and possible future\nimprovements to our pipeline.\n", "  We illuminate the nature of the three-dimensional random walks of\nmicroorganisms composed of individual organisms adhered together. Such\n$aggregate~random~walkers$ are typified by choanoflagellates, eukaryotes that\nare the closest living relatives of animals. In the colony-forming species\n$Salpingoeca~rosetta$ we show that the beating of each flagellum is stochastic\nand uncorrelated with others, and the vectorial sum of the flagellar propulsion\nmanifests as stochastic helical swimming. A quantitative theory for these\nresults is presented and species variability discussed.\n", "  In some axion dark matter models a dominant fraction of axions resides in\ndense small-scale substructures, axion miniclusters. A fraction of these\nsubstructures is disrupted and forms tidal streams where the axion density may\nstill be an order of magnitude larger than the average. We discuss implications\nof these streams for the direct axion searches. We estimate the fraction of\ndisrupted miniclusters and the parameters of the resulting streams, and find\nthat stream-crossing events would occur at a rate of about $1/(20 {\\rm yr})$\nfor 2-3 days, during which the signal in axion detectors would be amplified by\na factor $\\sim 10$. These estimates suggest that the effect of the tidal\ndisruption of axion miniclusters may be important for direct axion searches and\ndeserves a more thorough study.\n", "  In this paper a generalization of the Cahn-Hilliard theory of binary liquids\nis presented for multi-component incompressible liquid mixtures. First, a\nthermodynamically consistent convection-diffusion type dynamics is derived on\nthe basis of the Lagrange multiplier formalism. Next, a generalization of the\nbinary Cahn-Hilliard free energy functional is presented for arbitrary number\nof components, offering the utilization of independent pairwise equilibrium\ninterfacial properties. We show that the equilibrium two-component interfaces\nminimize the functional, and demonstrate, that the energy penalization for\nmulti-component states increases strictly monotonously as a function of the\nnumber of components being present. We validate the model via equilibrium\ncontact angle calculations in ternary and quaternary (4-component) systems.\nSimulations addressing liquid flow assisted spinodal decomposition in these\nsystems are also presented.\n", "  Compact radio sources sometimes exhibit intervals of large, rapid changes in\ntheir flux-density, due to lensing by interstellar plasma crossing the\nline-of-sight. A novel survey program has made it possible to discover these\n\"Extreme Scattering Events\" (ESEs) in real time, resulting in a high-quality\ndynamic spectrum of an ESE observed in PKS 1939-315. Here we present a method\nfor determining the column-density profile of a plasma lens, given only the\ndynamic radio spectrum of the lensed source, under the assumption that the lens\nis either axisymmetric or totally anisotropic. Our technique relies on the\nknown, strong frequency dependence of the plasma refractive index in order to\ndetermine how points in the dynamic spectrum map to positions on the lens. We\napply our method to high-frequency (4.2-10.8 GHz) data from the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array of the PKS 1939-315 ESE. The derived electron\ncolumn-density profiles are very similar for the two geometries we consider,\nand both yield a good visual match to the data. However, the fit residuals are\nsubstantially above the noise level, and deficiencies are evident when we\ncompare the predictions of our model to lower-frequency (1.6-3.1 GHz) data on\nthe same ESE, thus motivating future development of more sophisticated\ninversion techniques.\n", "  The compact X-ray source in the eclipsing X-ray binary IC 10 X-1 has reigned\nfor years as ostensibly the most massive stellar-mass black hole, with a mass\nestimated to be about twice that of its closest rival. However, striking\nresults presented recently by Laycock et al. reveal that the mass estimate,\nbased on emission-line velocities, is unreliable and that the mass of the X-ray\nsource is essentially unconstrained. Using Chandra and NuSTAR data, we rule\nagainst a neutron-star model and conclude that IC 10 X-1 contains a black hole.\nThe eclipse duration of IC 10 X-1 is shorter and its depth shallower at higher\nenergies, an effect consistent with the X-ray emission being obscured during\neclipse by a Compton-thick core of a dense wind. The spectrum is strongly\ndisk-dominated, which allows us to constrain the spin of the black hole via\nX-ray continuum fitting. Three other wind-fed black-hole systems are known; the\nmasses and spins of their black holes are high: M ~ 10-15 Msun and a*>0.8. If\nthe mass of IC 10 X-1's black hole is comparable, then its spin is likewise\nhigh.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae are considered to be important contributors to the\nprimitive dust enrichment of the interstellar medium in the high-redshift\nuniverse. Theoretical models of dust formation in stellar explosions have so\nfar provided controversial results and a generally poor fit to the observations\nof dust formation in local supernovae. We present a new methodology for the\ncalculation of carbonaceous dust formation in young supernova remnants. Our new\ntechnique uses both the nucleation theory and a chemical reaction network to\nallow us to compute the dust growth beyond the molecular level as well as to\nconsider chemical erosion of the forming grains. We find that carbonaceous dust\nforms efficiently in the core of the ejecta, but takes several years to\ncondensate, longer than previously estimated. It forms unevenly and remains\nconcentrated in the inner part of the remnant. These results support the role\nof core-collapse supernovae as dust factories and provide new insight on the\nobservations of SN 1987A, in which large amounts of dust have been detected to\nform on a timescale of years after core collapse.\n", "  We report on a systematic investigation of the cold and mildly ionized\ngaseous baryonic metal components of our Galaxy, through the analysis of high\nresolution Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra of two samples of Galactic and\nextragalactic sources. The comparison between lines of sight towards sources\nlocated in the disk of our Galaxy and extragalactic sources, allows us for the\nfirst time to clearly distinguish between gaseous metal components in the disk\nand halo of our Galaxy. We find that a Warm Ionized Metal Medium (WIMM)\npermeates a large volume above and below the Galaxy's disk, perhaps up to the\nCircum-Galactic space (CGM). This halo-WIMM imprints virtually the totality of\nthe OI and OII absorption seen in the spectra of our extragalactic targets, has\na temperature of T(Halo-WIMM)=2900 +/- 900 K, a density <n_H>(Halo-WIMM) =\n0.023 +/- 0.009 cm-3 and a metallicity Z(Halo-WIMM) = (0.4 +/- 0.1) Z_Solar.\nConsistently with previous works, we also confirm that the disk of the Galaxy\ncontains at least two distinct gaseous metal components, one cold and neutral\n(the CNMM: Cold Neutral Metal Medium) and one warm and mildly ionized, with the\nsame temperature of the Halo-WIMM, but higher density (<n_H>(Disk-WIMM) = 0.09\n+/- 0.03 cm-3) and metallicity (Z(Disk-WIMM) = 0.8 +/- 0.1$ Z_Solar). By\nadopting a simple disk+sphere geometry for the Galaxy, we estimates masses of\nthe CNMM and the total (disk + halo) WIMM of M(CNMM) <~ 8e8 Solar masses and\nM(WIMM) ~ 8.2e9 Solar masses.\n", "  We present photometric observations of RW Aurigae, a Classical T Tauri\nsystem, that reveal two remarkable dimming events. These events are similar to\nthat which we observed in 2010-2011, which was the first such deep dimming\nobserved in RW Aur in a century's worth of photometric monitoring. We suggested\nthe 2010-2011 dimming was the result of an occultation of the star by its\ntidally disrupted circumstellar disk. In 2012-2013, the RW Aur system dimmed by\n~0.7 mag for ~40 days and in 2014/2015 the system dimmed by ~2 mag for >250\ndays. The ingress/egress duration measurements of the more recent events agree\nwell with those from the 2010-2011 event, providing strong evidence that the\nnew dimmings are kinematically associated with the same occulting source.\nTherefore, we suggest that both the 2012-2013 and 2014-2015 dimming events,\nmeasured using data from the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope and the\nKutztown University Observatory, are also occultations of RW Aur A by tidally\ndisrupted circumstellar material. Recent hydrodynamical simulations of the\neccentric fly-by of RW Aur B suggest the occulting body to be a bridge of\nmaterial connecting RW Aur A and B. These simulations suggest the possibility\nof additional occultations, supported by the observations presented in this\nwork. The color evolution of the dimmings suggest that the tidally stripped\ndisk material includes dust grains ranging in size from small grains at the\nleading edge, typical of star forming regions, to large grains, ices or pebbles\nproducing grey or nearly grey extinction deeper within the occulting material.\nIt is not known whether this material represents arrested planet building prior\nto the tidal disruption event, or perhaps accelerated planet building as a\nresult of the disruption event, but in any case the evidence suggests the\npresence of advanced planet building material in the space between RW Aur A and\nB.\n", "  For a small driven system coupled strongly to a heat bath, internal energy\nand exchanged heat are identified such that they obey the usual additive form\nof the first law. By identifying this exchanged heat with the entropy change of\nthe bath, the total entropy production is shown to obey an integral fluctuation\ntheorem on the trajectory level implying the second law in the form of a\nClausius inequalilty on the ensemble level. In this Hamiltonian approach, the\nassumption of an initially uncorrelated state is not required. The conditions\nunder which the proposed identification of heat is unique and experimentally\naccessible are clarified.\n", "  We report on results from new high-sensitivity, high-resolution 86GHz (3.5\nmillimeter) observations of the jet base in the nearby radio galaxy M87,\nobtained by the Very Long Baseline Array in conjunction with the Green Bank\nTelescope. The resulting image has a dynamic range exceeding 1500 to 1, the\nhighest ever achieved for this jet at this frequency, resolving and imaging a\ndetailed jet formation/collimation structure down to ~10 Schwarzschild radii\n(Rs). The obtained 86GHz image clearly confirms some important jet features\nknown at lower frequencies, i.e., a wide-opening angle jet base, a\nlimb-brightened intensity profile, a parabola-shape collimation profile and a\ncounter jet. The limb-brightened structure is already well developed at <\n0.2mas (< 28Rs, projected) from the core, where the corresponding apparent\nopening angle becomes as wide as ~100 degrees. The subsequent jet collimation\nnear the black hole evolves in a complicated manner; there is a \"constricted\"\nstructure at tens Rs from the core, where the jet cross section is locally\nshrinking. We suggest that an external pressure support from the inner part of\nradiatively-inefficient accretion flow may be dynamically important in\nshaping/confining the footprint of the magnetized jet. We also present the\nfirst VLBI 86GHz polarimetric experiment for this source, where a highly\npolarized (~20%) feature is detected near the jet base, indicating the presence\nof a well-ordered magnetic field. As a by-product, we additionally report a\n43/86 GHz polarimetric result for our calibrator 3C 273 suggesting an extreme\nrotation measure near the core.\n", "  We report the discovery of NGC 253-dw2, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy\ncandidate undergoing tidal disruption around a nearby spiral galaxy, NGC 253 in\nthe Sculptor group: the first such event identified beyond the Local Group. The\ndwarf was found using small-aperture amateur telescopes, and followed up with\nSuprime-Cam on the 8 m Subaru Telescope in order to resolve its brightest\nstars. Using g- and R_c-band photometry, we detect a red giant branch\nconsistent with an old, metal-poor stellar population at a distance of ~ 3.5\nMpc. From the distribution of likely member stars, we infer a highly elongated\nshape with a semi-major axis half-light radius of (2 +/- 0.4) kpc. Star counts\nalso yield a luminosity estimate of ~ 2x10^6 L_Sun,V (M_V ~ -10.7). The\nmorphological properties of NGC 253-dw2 mark it as distinct from normal dSphs\nand imply ongoing disruption at a projected distance of ~ 50 kpc from the main\ngalaxy. Our observations support the hierarchical paradigm wherein massive\ngalaxies continously accrete less massive ones, and provide a new case study\nfor dSph infall and dissolution dynamics. We also note the continued efficacy\nof small telescopes for making big discoveries.\n", "  Photometric and spectroscopic observations of a slowly declining, luminous\nType Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011hr in the starburst galaxy NGC 2691 are\npresented. SN 2011hr is found to peak at $M_{B}=-19.84 \\pm 0.40\\,\\rm{mag}$,\nwith a post-maximum decline rate $\\Delta$m$_{15}$(B) = 0.92 $\\pm$\n0.03\\,$\\rm{mag}$. From the maximum-light bolometric luminosity, $L=(2.30 \\pm\n0.90) \\times 10^{43}\\,\\rm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, we estimate the mass of synthesized\n\\Nifs\\ in SN 2011hr to be $M(\\rm{^{56}Ni})=1.11 \\pm 0.43\\,M_{\\sun}$. SN 2011hr\nappears more luminous than SN 1991T at around maximum light, and the absorption\nfeatures from its intermediate-mass elements (IMEs) are noticeably weaker than\nthe latter at similar phases. Spectral modeling suggests that SN 2011hr has the\nIMEs of $\\sim$\\,0.07 M$_{\\sun}$ in the outer ejecta, which is much lower than\nthe typical value of normal SNe Ia (i.e., 0.3 -- 0.4 M$_{\\sun}$) and is also\nlower than the value of SN 1991T (i.e., $\\sim$\\,0.18 M$_{\\sun}$). These results\nindicate that SN 2011hr may arise from a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf\nprogenitor that experienced a more efficient burning process in the explosion.\nNevertheless, it is still possible that SN 2011hr may serve as a transitional\nobject connecting the SN 1991T-like SNe Ia with the superluminous subclass like\nSN 2007if given that the latter also shows very weak IMEs at all phases.\n", "  In our preceding paper, Liverpool Telescope data of M31 novae in eruption\nwere used to facilitate a search for their progenitor systems within archival\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) data, with the aim of detecting systems with red\ngiant secondaries (RG-novae) or luminous accretion disks. From an input catalog\nof 38 spectroscopically confirmed novae with archival quiescent observations,\nlikely progenitors were recovered for eleven systems. Here we present the\nresults of the subsequent statistical analysis of the original survey,\nincluding possible biases associated with the survey and the M31 nova\npopulation in general. As part of this analysis we examine the distribution of\noptical decline times (t(2)) of M31 novae, how the likely bulge and disk nova\ndistributions compare, and how the M31 t(2) distribution compares to that of\nthe Milky Way. Using a detailed Monte Carlo simulation, we determine that 30\n(+13/-10) percent of all M31 nova eruptions can be attributed to RG-nova\nsystems, and at the 99 percent confidence level, >10 percent of all M31 novae\nare RG-novae. This is the first estimate of a RG-nova rate of an entire galaxy.\nOur results also imply that RG-novae in M31 are more likely to be associated\nwith the M31 disk population than the bulge, indeed the results are consistent\nwith all RG-novae residing in the disk. If this result is confirmed in other\ngalaxies, it suggests any Type Ia supernovae that originate from RG-nova\nsystems are more likely to be associated with younger populations, and may be\nrare in old stellar populations, such as early-type galaxies.\n", "  In this paper, we study shock structures of collisionless shocks in partially\nionized plasmas by means of two-dimensional hybrid simulations, where the shock\nis a perpendicular shock with shock velocity Vsh ~ 40 Va ~ 1333 km/s and the\nupstream ionization fraction is 0.5. We find that large density fluctuations\nand large magnetic fields fluctuations are generated both in the upstream and\ndownstream regions. In addition, we find that the velocity distribution of\ndownstream hydrogen atoms has three components. Observed shock structures\nsuggest that diffusive shock acceleration can operate at perpendicular shocks\npropagating into partially ionized plasmas in real three-dimensional systems.\n", "  We present a new solution of relativistic hydrodynamics in 1+3 dimensions\nwhich depends on both the transverse coordinate and rapidity. At early times\nthe flow expands dominantly longitudinally in a non-boost-invariant manner, and\nat late times it expands nearly spherically. These two regimes are shown to be\nrelated by symmetry. The effect of viscosity is also discussed.\n", "  We developed a low-mass and high-efficiency charged particle detector for an\nexperimental study of the rare decay $K_L \\rightarrow \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$. The\ndetector is important to suppress the background with charged particles to the\nlevel below the signal branching ratio predicted by the Standard Model\n(O(10$^{-11}$)). The detector consists of two layers of 3-mm-thick plastic\nscintillators with wavelength shifting fibers embedded and Multi Pixel Photon\nCounters for readout. We manufactured the counter and evaluated the performance\nsuch as light yield, timing resolution, and efficiency. With this design, we\nachieved the inefficiency per layer against penetrating charged particles to be\nless than $1.5 \\times 10^{-5}$, which satisfies the requirement of the KOTO\nexperiment determined from simulation studies.\n", "  Using galaxies as background light sources to map the Lya absorption lines is\na novel approach to study Damped Lya Absorbers (DLAs). We report the discovery\nof an intervening z = 3.335 +- 0.007 DLA along a galaxy sight-line identified\namong 80 Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) spectra obtained with our Very Large\nTelescope/Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph survey in the SSA22 field. The\nmeasured DLA neutral hydrogen (HI) column density is log (NHI/cm^{-2}) = 21.68\n+- 0.17. The DLA covering fraction over the extended background LBG is > 70% (2\nsigma), yielding a conservative constraint on the DLA area of > 1 kpc^2. Our\nsearch for a counterpart galaxy hosting this DLA concludes that there is no\ncounterpart galaxy with star formation rate (SFR) larger than a few Msun\nyr^{-1}, ruling out an unobscured violent star formation in the DLA gas cloud.\nWe also rule out the possibility that the host galaxy of the DLA is a passive\ngalaxy with Mstar > 5 x 10^{10} Msun or a heavily dust-obscured galaxy with\nE(B-V) > 2. The DLA may coincide with a large-scale overdensity of the\nspectroscopic LBGs. The occurrence rate of the DLA is compatible with that of\nDLAs found in QSO sight-lines.\n", "  The ionization state of the gas in the dynamic solar chromosphere can depart\nstrongly from the instantaneous statistical equilibrium commonly assumed in\nnumerical modeling. We improve on earlier simulations of the solar atmosphere\nthat only included non-equilbrium hydrogen ionization by performing a 2D\nradiation-magneto-hydrodynamics simulation featuring non-equilibrium ionization\nof both hydrogen and helium. The simulation includes the effect of hydrogen\nLyman-$\\alpha$ and the EUV radiation from the corona on the ionization and\nheating of the atmosphere. Details on code implementation are given. We obtain\nhelium ion fractions that are far from their equilibrium values. Comparison\nwith models with LTE ionization shows that non-equilibrium helium ionization\nleads to higher temperatures in wave fronts and lower temperatures in the gas\nbetween shocks. Assuming LTE ionization results in a thermostat-like behaviour\nwith matter accumulating around the temperatures where the LTE ionization\nfractions change rapidly. Comparison of DEM curves computed from our models\nshows that non-equilibrium ionization leads to more radiating material in the\ntemperature range 11-18 kK compared to models with LTE helium ionization. We\nconclude that non-equilbrium helium ionization is important for the dynamics\nand thermal structure of the upper chromosphere and transition region. It might\nalso help resolve the problem that intensities of chromospheric lines computed\nfrom current models are smaller than those observed.\n", "  Recently, the LHC collaborations, ATLAS and CMS, have announced an excess in\nthe diphoton channel with local significance of about $3\\,\\sigma$ around an\ninvariant mass distribution of $\\sim 750$ GeV, after analyzing new data\ncollected at centre-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s} = 13~{\\rm TeV}$. We present a\npossible physical interpretation of such a signature, within the framework of a\nminimal UV-complete model with a massive singlet pseudo-scalar state $a$ that\ncouples to a new TeV-scale coloured vector-like fermion $F$, whose hypercharge\nquantum number is a non-zero integer. The pseudo-scalar state $a$ might be a\nheavy pseudo-Goldstone boson, such as a heavy axion, which decays into two\nphotons and whose mass lies around the excess region. The mass of the CP-odd\nstate $a$ and its coupling to $F$ may be due to non-perturbative effects, which\ncan break the original Goldstone shift symmetry dynamically. The possible role\nthat the heavy axion $a$ can play in the radiative generation of a seesaw\nMajorana scale and in the solution to the so-called strong CP problem is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  We have developed a search methodology to identify galaxy protoclusters at\n$z>2.74$, and implemented it on a sample of $\\sim$14,000 galaxies with\npreviously measured redshifts. The results of this search are recorded in the\nCandidate Cluster and Protocluster Catalog (CCPC). The catalog contains 12\nclusters that are highly significant overdensities ($\\delta_{gal}>7$), 6 of\nwhich are previously known. We also identify another 31 candidate protoclusters\n(including 4 previously identified structures) of lower overdensity. CCPC\nsystems vary over a wide range of physical sizes and shapes, from small,\ncompact groups to large, extended, and filamentary collections of galaxies.\nThis variety persists over the range from $z=3.71$ to $z=2.74$. These\nstructures exist as galaxy overdensities ($\\delta_{gal}$) with a mean value of\n2, similar to the values found for other protoclusters in the literature. The\nmedian number of galaxies for CCPC systems is 11. Virial mass estimates are\nlarge for these redshifts, with thirteen cases apparently having $M > 10^{15}\\,\nM_{\\odot}$. If these systems are virialized, such masses would pose a challenge\nto $\\Lambda$CDM.\n", "  Large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations (LALOs) in prominences are\nspectacular manifestations of the solar activity. In such events nearby\nenergetic disturbances induce periodic motions on filaments with displacements\ncomparable to the size of the filaments themselves and with velocities larger\nthan 20 km/s. The pendulum model, in which the gravity projected along a rigid\nmagnetic field is the restoring force, was proposed to explain these events.\nHowever, it can be objected that in a realistic situation where the magnetic\nfield reacts to the mass motion of the heavy prominence, the simplified\npendulum model could be no longer valid. We have performed non-linear\ntime-dependent numerical simulations of LALOs considering a dipped magnetic\nfield line structure. In this work we demonstrate that for even relatively weak\nmagnetic fields the pendulum model works very well. We therefore validate the\npendulum model and show its robustness, with important implications for\nprominence seismology purposes. With this model it is possible to infer the\ngeometry of the dipped field lines that support the prominence.\n", "  The spin-1 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain with the second-neighbor\ninteraction between the nodal spins is rigorously solved using the\ntransfer-matrix method. Exact results for the ground state, magnetization\nprocess and specific heat are presented and discussed in particular. It is\nshown that the further-neighbor interaction between the nodal spins gives rise\nto three novel ground states with a translationally broken symmetry, but at the\nsame time, it does not increases the total number of intermediate plateaus in a\nzero-temperature magnetization curve compared with the simplified model without\nthis interaction term. The zero-field specific heat displays interesting\nthermal dependencies with a single- or double-peak structure.\n", "  Giant exoplanets orbiting very close to their parent star (hot Jupiters) are\nsubject to tidal forces expected to synchronize their rotational and orbital\nperiods on short timescales (tidal locking). However, spin rotation has never\nbeen measured directly for hot Jupiters. Furthermore, their atmospheres can\nshow equatorial super-rotation via strong eastward jet streams, and/or\nhigh-altitude winds flowing from the day- to the night-side hemisphere. Planet\nrotation and atmospheric circulation broaden and distort the planet spectral\nlines to an extent that is detectable with measurements at high spectral\nresolution. We observed a transit of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b around 2.3\n{\\mu}m and at a spectral resolution of R~10$^5$ with CRIRES at the ESO Very\nLarge Telescope. After correcting for the stellar absorption lines and their\ndistortion during transit (the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect), we detect the\nabsorption of carbon monoxide and water vapor in the planet transmission\nspectrum by cross-correlating with model spectra. The signal is maximized\n(7.6{\\sigma}) for a planet rotational velocity of $(3.4^{+1.3}_{-2.1})$ km/s,\ncorresponding to a rotational period of $(1.7^{+2.9}_{-0.4})$ days. This is\nconsistent with the planet orbital period of 2.2 days and therefore with tidal\nlocking. We find that the rotation of HD 189733 b is longer than 1 day\n(3{\\sigma}). The data only marginally (1.5{\\sigma}) prefer models with rotation\nversus models without rotation. We measure a small day- to night-side wind\nspeed of $(-1.7^{+1.1}_{-1.2})$ km/s. Compared to the recent detection of\nsodium blue-shifted by (8$\\pm$2) km/s, this likely implies a strong vertical\nwind shear between the pressures probed by near-infrared and optical\ntransmission spectroscopy.\n", "  The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) provides spectroscopy and\nnarrow band slit-jaw (SJI) imaging of the solar chromosphere and transition\nregion at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Combined with\nhigh-resolution context spectral imaging of the photosphere and chromosphere as\nprovided by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), we can now effectively trace\ndynamic phenomena through large parts of the solar atmosphere in both space and\ntime. IRIS SJI 1400 images from active regions, which primarily sample the\ntransition region with the Si IV 1394 and 1403 {\\AA} lines, reveal ubiquitous\nbright \"grains\" which are short-lived (2-5 min) bright roundish small patches\nof sizes 0.5-1.7\" that generally move limbward with velocities up to about 30\nkm s$^{-1}$. In this paper we show that many bright grains are the result of\nchromospheric shocks impacting the transition region. These shocks are\nassociated with dynamic fibrils (DFs), most commonly observed in H{\\alpha}. We\nfind that the grains show strongest emission in the ascending phase of the DF,\nthat the emission is strongest towards the top of the DF and that the grains\ncorrespond to a blueshift and broadening of the Si IV lines. We note that the\nSJI 1400 grains can also be observed in the SJI 1330 channel which is dominated\nby C II lines. Our observations show that a significant part of the active\nregion transition region dynamics is driven from the chromosphere below rather\nthan from coronal activity above. We conclude that the shocks that drive DFs\nalso play an important role in the heating of the upper chromosphere and lower\ntransition region.\n", "  We argue that the QCD axion can arise from many aligned axions with decay\nconstants much smaller than the conventional axion window. If the typical decay\nconstant is of {\\cal O}{(100)} GeV to 1 TeV, one or more of the axions or\nsaxions may account for the recently found diphoton excess at \\sim 750 GeV. Our\nscenario predicts many axions and saxions coupled to gluons with decay\nconstants of order the weak scale, and therefore many collider signatures by\nheavy axions and saxions will show up at different energy scales. In\nparticular, if the inferred broad decay width is due to multiple axions or\nsaxions, a non-trivial peak structure may become evident when more data is\ncollected. We also discuss cosmological implications of the aligned QCD axion\nscenario. In the Appendix we give a possible UV completion and argue that the\nhigh quality of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is naturally explained in our\nscenario.\n", "  We present the first results and design from the redshift z~9-10 Brightest of\nthe Reionizing Galaxies {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} survey BoRG[z9-10], aimed\nat searching for intrinsically luminous unlensed galaxies during the first 700\nMyr after the Big Bang. BoRG[z9-10] is the continuation of a multi-year\npure-parallel near-IR and optical imaging campaign with the Wide Field Camera\n3. The ongoing survey uses five filters, optimized for detecting the most\ndistant objects and offering continuous wavelength coverage from\n{\\lambda}=0.35{\\mu}m to {\\lambda}=1.7{\\mu}m. We analyze the initial ~130\narcmin$^2$ of area over 28 independent lines of sight (~25% of the total\nplanned) to search for z>7 galaxies using a combination of Lyman break and\nphotometric redshift selections. From an effective comoving volume of (5-25)\n$times 10^5$ Mpc$^3$ for magnitudes brighter than $m_{AB}=26.5-24.0$ in the\n$H_{160}$-band respectively, we find five galaxy candidates at z~8.3-10\ndetected at high confidence (S/N>8), including a source at z~8.4 with mAB=24.5\n(S/N~22), which, if confirmed, would be the brightest galaxy identified at such\nearly times (z>8). In addition, BoRG[z9-10] data yield four galaxies with $7.3\n\\lesssim z \\lesssim 8$. These new Lyman break galaxies with m$\\lesssim26.5$ are\nideal targets for follow-up observations from ground and space based\nobservatories to help investigate the complex interplay between dark matter\ngrowth, galaxy assembly, and reionization.\n", "  The LMXB NS GS 1826-238 was discovered by Ginga in 1988 September. Due to the\npresence of quasi-periodicity in the type I X-ray burst rate, the source has\nbeen a frequent target of X-ray observations for almost 30 years. Though the\nbursts were too soft to be detected by INTEGRAL/SPI, the persistent emission\nfrom GS 1826-238 was detected over 150 keV during the ~10 years of\nobservations. Spectral analysis found a significant high-energy excess above a\nComptonization model that is well fit by a power law, indicating an additional\nspectral component. Most previously reported spectra with hard tails in LMXB NS\nhave had an electron temperature of a few keV and a hard tail dominating above\n~50 keV with an index of \\Gamma ~ 2-3. GS 1826-238 was found to have a markedly\ndifferent spectrum with $ kT_e \\sim 20 $ keV and a hard tail dominating above\n~150 keV with an index of \\Gamma ~ 1.8, more similar to BHXRB. We report on our\nsearch for long-term spectral variability over the 25-370 keV energy range and\non a comparison of the GS 1826-238 average spectrum to the spectra of other\nLMXB NS with hard tails.\n", "  Two distinct routes lead to the creation of multi--scale equilibrium\nstructures in dense degenerate plasmas, often met in astrophysical conditions.\nBy analyzing an e-p-i plasma consisting of degenerate electrons and positrons\nwith a small contamination of mobile classical ions, we show the creation of a\nnew macro scale $L_{\\rm{macro}}$ (controlled by ion concentration). The\ntemperature and degeneracy enhancement effective inertia of bulk e-p components\nalso makes the effective skin depths larger (much larger) than the standard\nskin depth. The emergence of these intermediate and macro scales lends immense\nrichness to the process of structure formation, and vastly increases the\nchannels for energy transformations. The possible role played by this mechanism\nin explaining the existence of large-scale structures in astrophysical objects\nwith degenerate plasmas, is examined.\n", "  We study two-dimensional ${\\cal N}=(2,2)$ gauge theory and its dualized\nsystem in terms of complex (linear) superfields and their alternatives.\nAlthough this technique itself is not new, we can obtain a new model, the\nso-called \"semi-doubled\" GLSM. Similar to doubled sigma model, this involves\nboth the original and dual degrees of freedom simultaneously, whilst the latter\nonly contribute to the system via topological interactions. Applying this to\nthe ${\\cal N}=(4,4)$ GLSM for H-monopoles, i.e., smeared NS5-branes, we obtain\nits T-dualized systems in quite an easy way. As a bonus, we also obtain the\nsemi-doubled GLSM for an exotic $5^3_2$-brane whose background is locally\nnongeometric. In the low energy limit, we construct the semi-doubled NLSM which\nalso generates the conventional string worldsheet sigma models. In the case of\nthe NLSM for $5^3_2$-brane, however, we find that the Dirac monopole equation\ndoes not make sense any more because the physical information is absorbed into\nthe divergent part via the smearing procedure. This is nothing but the signal\nwhich indicates that the nongeometric feature emerges in the considering model.\n", "  Grain growth in planet-forming disks is the first step toward the formation\nof planets. The growth of grains and their inward drift leaves a distinct\nimprint on the dust surface-density distribution and the resulting\nsurface-brightness profile of the thermal continuum emission. We determine the\nsurface-brightness profile of the continuum emission using resolved\nobservations at millimeter wavelengths of the disk around TW Hya, and infer the\nsignature of dust evolution on the surface density and dust opacity. Archival\nALMA observations at 820 micron on baselines up to 410 kilolambda are compared\nto parametrized disk models to determine the surface-brightness profile. Under\nthe assumption of a constant dust opacity, a broken radial power law best\ndescribes the dust surface density, with a slope of -0.53 +/- 0.01 from the 4.1\nau radius of the (already known) inner hole to a turn-over radius of 47.1 +/-\n0.2 au, steepening to -8.0 +/- 0.1 at larger radii. The emission drops below\nthe detection limit beyond ~60 au. The shape of the dust surface density is\nconsistent with theoretical expectations for grain growth, fragmentation, and\ndrift, but its total dust content and its turn-over radius are too large for TW\nHya's age of 8-10 Myr even when taking into account a radially varying dust\nopacity. Higher resolution imaging with ALMA of TW Hya and other disks is\nrequired to establish if unseen gaps associated with, e.g., embedded planets\ntrap grains at large radii or if locally enhanced grain growth associated with\nthe CO snow line explains the extent of the millimeter-continuum surface\nbrightness profile. In the latter case, population studies should reveal a\ncorrelation between the location of the CO snow line and the extent of the\nmillimeter continuum. In the former case, and if CO freeze out promotes planet\nformation, this correlation should extend to the location of gaps as well.\n", "  Physical processes which may lead to solar chromospheric heating are analyzed\nusing high-resolution 1.5D non-ideal MHD modelling. We demonstrate that it is\npossible to heat the chromospheric plasma by direct resistive dissipation of\nhigh-frequency Alfv\\'en waves through Pedersen resistivity. However this is\nunlikely to be sufficient to balance radiative and conductive losses unless\nunrealistic field strengths or photospheric velocities are used. The precise\nheating profile is determined by the input driving spectrum since in 1.5D there\nis no possibility of Alfv\\'en wave turbulence. The inclusion of the Hall term\ndoes not affect the heating rates. If plasma compressibility is taken into\naccount, shocks are produced through the ponderomotive coupling of Alfv\\'en\nwaves to slow modes and shock heating dominates the resistive dissipation. In\n1.5D shock coalescence amplifies the effects of shocks and for compressible\nsimulations with realistic driver spectra the heating rate exceeds that\nrequired to match radiative and conductive losses. Thus while the heating rates\nfor these 1.5D simulations are an overestimate they do show that ponderomotive\ncoupling of Alfv\\'en waves to sound waves is more important in chromospheric\nheating than Pedersen dissipation through ion-neutral collisions.\n", "  Disc fragmentation provides an important mechanism for producing low mass\nstars in prestellar cores. Here, we describe Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics\nsimulations which show how populations of prestellar cores evolve into stars.\nWe find the observed masses and multiplicities of stars can be recovered under\ncertain conditions.\n  First, protostellar feedback from a star must be episodic. The continuous\naccretion of disc material on to a central protostar results in local\ntemperatures which are too high for disc fragmentation. If, however, the\naccretion occurs in intense outbursts, separated by a downtime of\n$\\sim10^4\\,\\mathrm{years}$, gravitational instabilities can develop and the\ndisc can fragment.\n  Second, a significant amount of the cores' internal kinetic energy should be\nin solenoidal turbulent modes. Cores with less than a third of their kinetic\nenergy in solenoidal modes have insufficient angular momentum to form\nfragmenting discs. In the absence of discs, cores can fragment but results in a\ntop heavy distribution of masses with very few low mass objects.\n", "  We offer a broad review of Balmer line phenomenology in type 1 active\ngalactic nuclei, briefly sum- marising luminosity and radio loudness effects,\nand discussing interpretation in terms of nebular physics along the 4D\neigenvector 1 sequence of quasars. We stress that relatively rare, peculiar\nBalmer line profiles (i.e., with large shifts with respect to the rest frame or\ndouble and multiple peaked) that start attracted attentions since the 1970s are\nstill passable of multiple dynamical interpretation. More mainstream objects\nare still not fully understood as well, since competing dynamical models and\ngeometries are possible. Further progress may come from inter-line comparison\nacross the 4D Eigenvector 1 sequence.\n", "  The Swiss Federal Observatory, which had been founded in 1863 by Rudolf Wolf,\nwas dissolved in connection with the retirement of Max Waldmeier in 1979. The\ndetermination of the Zurich sunpot number, which had been a cornerstone\nactivity of the observatory, was then discontinued by ETH Zurich. A smooth\ntransition of the responsibility for the sunspot number from Zurich to Brussels\ncould however be achieved in 1980, through which it was possible to avoid a\ndiscontinuity in this important time series. Here we describe the circumstances\nthat led to the termination in Zurich, how Brussels was chosen for the\nsuccession, and how the transfer was accomplished.\n", "  We propose a simple model with spin and orbit angular momentum coupling in a\nspin-1 Bose- Einstein condensate, where three internal atomic states are Raman\ncoupled by a pair of co- propagating Laguerre-Gaussian beams. The resulting\nRaman transition imposes a transfer of orbital angular momentum between photons\nand the condensate in a spin-dependent way. Focusing on a regime where the\nsingle-particle ground state is nearly three-fold degenerate, we show that the\nweak interatomic interaction in the condensate produces a rich phase diagram,\nand that a many-body Rabi oscillation between two quantum phases can be induced\nby a sudden quench of the quadratic Zeeman shift. We carried out our\ncalculations using both a variational method and a full numerical method, and\nfound excellent agreement.\n", "  Although the sunspot-number series have existed since the mid-19th century,\nthey are still the subject of intense debate, with the largest uncertainty\nbeing related to the \"calibration\" of the visual acuity of individual observers\nin the past. Daisy-chain regression methods are applied to inter-calibrate the\nobservers which may lead to significant bias and error accumulation. Here we\npresent a novel method to calibrate the visual acuity of the key observers to\nthe reference data set of Royal Greenwich Observatory sunspot groups for the\nperiod 1900-1976, using the statistics of the active-day fraction. For each\nobserver we independently evaluate their observational thresholds [S_S] defined\nsuch that the observer is assumed to miss all of the groups with an area\nsmaller than S_S and report all the groups larger than S_S. Next, using a\nMonte-Carlo method we construct, from the reference data set, a correction\nmatrix for each observer. The correction matrices are significantly non-linear\nand cannot be approximated by a linear regression or proportionality. We\nemphasize that corrections based on a linear proportionality between annually\naveraged data lead to serious biases and distortions of the data. The\ncorrection matrices are applied to the original sunspot group records for each\nday, and finally the composite corrected series is produced for the period\nsince 1748. The corrected series displays secular minima around 1800 (Dalton\nminimum) and 1900 (Gleissberg minimum), as well as the Modern grand maximum of\nactivity in the second half of the 20th century. The uniqueness of the grand\nmaximum is confirmed for the last 250 years. It is shown that the adoption of a\nlinear relationship between the data of Wolf and Wolfer results in grossly\ninflated group numbers in the 18th and 19th centuries in some reconstructions.\n", "  Computational models of interstellar gas-grain chemistry have historically\nadopted a single dust-grain size of 0.1 micron, assumed to be representative of\nthe size distribution present in the interstellar medium. Here, we investigate\nthe effects of a broad grain-size distribution on the chemistry on dust-grain\nsurfaces and the subsequent build-up of molecular ices on the grains, using a\nthree-phase gas-grain chemical model of a quiescent dark cloud. We include an\nexplicit treatment of the grain temperatures, governed both by the visual\nextinction of the cloud and the size of each individual grain-size population.\nWe find that the temperature difference plays a significant role in determining\nthe total bulk ice composition across the grain-size distribution, while the\neffects of geometrical differences between size populations appear marginal. We\nalso consider collapse from a diffuse to a dark cloud, allowing dust\ntemperatures to fall. Under the initial diffuse conditions, small grains are\ntoo warm to promote grain-mantle build-up, with most ices forming on the\nmid-sized grains. As collapse proceeds, the more abundant, smallest grains cool\nand become the dominant ice carriers; the large population of small grains\nmeans that this ice is distributed across many grains, with perhaps no more\nthan 40 monolayers of ice each (versus several hundred assuming a single grain\nsize). This effect may be important for the subsequent processing and\ndesorption of the ice during the hot-core phase of star-formation, exposing a\nsignificant proportion of the ice to the gas phase, increasing the importance\nof ice-surface chemistry and surface-gas interactions.\n", "  Mid-infrared arcs of dust emission are often seen near ionizing stars within\nHII regions. A possible explanations for these arcs is that they could show the\nouter edges of asymmetric stellar wind bubbles. We use two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of wind bubbles within HII regions around\nindividual stars to predict the infrared emission properties of the dust within\nthe HII region. We assume that dust and gas are dynamically well-coupled and\nthat dust properties (composition, size distribution) are the same in the HII\nregion as outside it, and that the wind bubble contains no dust. We\npost-process the simulations to make synthetic intensity maps at infrared\nwavebands using the TORUS code. We find that the outer edge of a wind bubble\nemits brightly at 24um through starlight absorbed by dust grains and\nre-radiated thermally in the infrared. This produces a bright arc of emission\nfor slowly moving stars that have asymmetric wind bubbles, even for cases where\nthere is no bow shock or any corresponding feature in tracers of gas emission.\nThe 24um intensity decreases exponentially from the arc with increasing\ndistance from the star because the dust temperature decreases with distance.\nThe size distribution and composition of the dust grains has quantitative but\nnot qualitative effects on our results. Despite the simplifications of our\nmodel, we find good qualitative agreement with observations of the HII region\nRCW120, and can provide physical explanations for any quantitative differences.\nOur model produces an infrared arc with the same shape and size as the arc\naround CD -38 11636 in RCW120, and with comparable brightness. This suggests\nthat infrared arcs around O stars in HII regions may be revealing the extent of\nstellar wind bubbles, although we have not excluded other explanations.\n", "  When planetesimals grow via collisions in a turbulent disk, stirring through\ndensity fluctuation caused by turbulence effectively increases the relative\nvelocities between planetesimals, which suppresses the onset of runaway growth.\nWe investigate the onset of runaway growth in a turbulent disk through\nsimulations that calculate the mass and velocity evolution of planetesimals.\nWhen planetesimals are small, the average relative velocity between\nplanetesimals, $v_{\\rm r}$, is much greater than their surface escape velocity,\n$v_{\\rm esc}$, so that runaway growth does not occur. As planetesimals become\nlarge via collisional growth, $v_{\\rm r}$ approaches $v_{\\rm esc}$. When\n$v_{\\rm r} \\approx 1.5 v_{\\rm esc}$, runaway growth of the planetesimals\noccurs. During the oligarchic growth subsequent to runaway growth, a small\nnumber of planetary embryos produced via runaway growth become massive through\ncollisions with planetesimals with radii of that at the onset of runaway\ngrowth, $r_{\\rm p,run}$. We analytically derive $r_{\\rm p,run}$ as a function\nof the turbulent strength. Growing $\\sim 10\\,M_\\oplus$ embryos that are\nsuitable to become the cores of Jupiter and Saturn requires $r_{\\rm p,run} \\sim\n100$\\,km, which is similar to the proposed fossil feature in the size\ndistribution of main belt asteroids. In contrast, the formation of Mars as\nquickly as suggested from Hf-W isotope studies requires small planetesimals at\nthe onset of runaway growth. Thus, the conditions required to form Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn and the size distribution of the main-belt asteroids\nindicate that the turbulence increased in amplitude relative to the sound speed\nwith increasing distance from the young Sun.\n", "  Observations of Neptune with the Kepler Space Telescope yield a 49-day light\ncurve with 98% coverage at a 1-minute cadence. A significant signature in the\nlight curve comes from discrete cloud features. We compare results extracted\nfrom the light curve data with contemporaneous disk-resolved imaging of Neptune\nfrom the Keck 10-meter telescope at 1.65 microns and Hubble Space Telescope\nvisible imaging acquired 9 months later. This direct comparison validates the\nfeature latitudes assigned to the K2 light curve periods based on Neptune's\nzonal wind profile, and confirms observed cloud feature variability. Although\nNeptune's clouds vary in location and intensity on short and long time scales,\na single large discrete storm seen in Keck imaging dominates the K2 and Hubble\nlight curves; smaller or fainter clouds likely contribute to short-term\nbrightness variability. The K2 Neptune light curve, in conjunction with our\nimaging data, provides context for the interpretation of current and future\nbrown dwarf and extrasolar planet variability measurements. In particular we\nsuggest that the balance between large, relatively stable, atmospheric features\nand smaller, more transient, clouds controls the character of substellar\natmospheric variability. Atmospheres dominated by a few large spots may show\ninherently greater light curve stability than those which exhibit a greater\nnumber of smaller features.\n", "  Radial differential rotation is an important parameter for stellar dynamo\ntheory and for understanding angular momentum transport. We investigate the\npotential of using a large number of similar stars simultaneously to constrain\ntheir average radial differential rotation gradient: we call this 'ensemble\nfitting'. We use a range of stellar models along the main sequence, each with a\nsynthetic rotation profile. The rotation profiles are step functions with a\nstep of -350 nHz, which is located at the base of the convection zone. These\nmodels are used to compute the rotational splittings of the p modes and to\nmodel their uncertainties. We then fit an ensemble of stars to infer the\naverage step size. All the uncertainties on the inferred step size for\nindividual stars are of the order 1 micro Hz. Using 15 stellar models in an\nensemble fit, we show that the uncertainty on the average step size is reduced\nto less than the input step size, which allows us to constrain the sign of the\nradial differential rotation. We show that a solar-like step size\n(approximately 30 nHz) can be constrained by an ensemble fit of thousands of\nmain-sequence stars. Observing the number of stars required to successfully\nexploit the ensemble fitting method will be possible with future\nasteroseismology missions, such as PLATO. We demonstrate the potential of\nensemble fitting by showing that any systematic differences in the average step\nsize between F, G, and K-type stars larger than 100 nHz can be detected.\n", "  Dark Matter is a hypothetical particle proposed to explain the missing matter\nexpected from the cosmological observation. The motivation of Dark Matter is\noverwhelming however as it is mainly deduced from its gravitational\ninteraction, for it does little to pinpoint what Dark Matter really is. In\nWIMPs Miracle, weakly interactive massive particle being the Dark Matter\ncandidate is correctly producing the current thermal relic density at weak\nscale, implying the possibility of producing and detecting it in Large Hadron\nCollider. Assuming WIMPs being the maverick particle within collider, it is\nexpected to be pair produced in association with a Standard Model particle. The\npresence of the WIMPs pair is inferred from the Missing Transverse Energy (MET)\nwhich is the vector sum of the imbalance in the transverse momentum plane\nrecoils a Standard Model Particle. The collider is able to produce light mass\nDark Matter which the traditional detection fail to detect due to the small\nmomentum transfer involved in the interaction; on the other hand, the\ntraditional detection is robust in detecting a higher Dark matter masses but\nthe collider is su ered from the parton distribution function suppression.\nTopologically the processes are similar to the scattering processes in the\ndirect detection thus complementary to the traditional Dark Matter detection.\nThe collider searches are strongly motivated as the results are usually\ntranslated to the annihilation and scattering rates at more traditional Dark\nMatter-oriented experiments, thus a concordance approach is adapted. An\noverview of Dark Matter searches at the Large Hadron Collider will be covered\nin this paper.\n", "  Observations of very early multi-wavelength afterglows are critical to reveal\nthe properties of the radiating fireball and its environment as well as the\ncentral engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We report our optical observations\nof GRB 111228A from 95 sec to about 50 hours after the burst trigger and\ninvestigate its properties of the prompt gamma-rays and the ambient medium\nusing our data and the data observed with {\\em Swift} and {\\em Fermi} missions.\nOur joint optical and X-ray spectral fits to the afterglow data show that the\nambient medium features as low dust-to-gas ratio. Incorporating the energy\ninjection effect, our best fit to the afterglow lightcurves with the standard\nafterglow model via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique shows that\n$\\epsilon_e=(6.9\\pm 0.3)\\times 10^{-2}$, $\\epsilon_B=(7.73\\pm 0.62)\\times\n10^{-6}$, $E_{\\rm K}=(6.32\\pm 0.86)\\times 10^{53}\\rm erg$, $n=0.100\\pm 0.014$\ncm$^{-3}$. The low medium density likely implies that the afterglow jet may be\nin a halo or in a hot ISM. Achromatic shallow decay segment observed in the\noptical and X-ray bands is well explained with the long-lasting energy\ninjection from the central engine, which would be a magnetar with a period of\nabout 1.92 ms inferred from the data. The $E_p$ of its time-integrated prompt\ngamma-ray spectrum is $\\sim 26$ KeV. Using the initial Lorentz factor\n($\\Gamma_0=476^{+225}_{-237}$) derived from our afterglow model fit, it is\nfound that GRB 111228A satisfies the $L_{\\rm iso}-E_{\\rm p,z}-\\Gamma_0$\nrelation and bridges the typical GRBs and low luminosity GRBs in this relation.\n", "  Over past ten years a variety of jet-like phenomena were detected in the\nsolar atmosphere, including plasma ejections over a range of coronal\ntemperatures being observed as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray jets. We\nstudy the possibility for the development of Kelvin--Helmholtz (KH) instability\nof transverse magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves traveling along an EUV jet\nsituated on the west side of NOAA AR 10938 and observed by three instruments on\nboard Hinode on 2007 January 15/16 (Chifor et al., Astron. Astrophys.481, L57\n(2008)). The jet was observed around LogT_e = 6.2 with up-flow velocities\nexceeded 150 km/s. Using Fe XII lambda186 and lambda195 line ratios, the\nmeasured densities were found to be above LogN_e = 11. We have modeled that EUV\njet as a vertically moving magnetic flux tube (untwisted and weakly twisted)\nand have studied the propagation characteristics of the kink (m = 1) mode and\nthe higher m modes with azimuthal mode numbers m = 2, 3, 4. It turns out that\nall these MHD waves can become unstable at flow velocities in the range of\n112--114.8 km/s. The lowest critical jet velocity of 112 km/s is obtained when\nmodeling the jet as compressible plasma contained in an untwisted magnetic flux\ntube. We have compared two analytically found criteria for predicting the\nthreshold Alfven Mach number for the onset of KH instability and have concluded\nthat one of them yields reliable values for the critical Alfven Mach number.\nOur study of the nature of stable and unstable MHD modes propagating on the jet\nshows that in a stable regime all the modes are pure surface waves, while the\nunstable kink (m = 1) mode in untwisted compressible plasma flux tube becomes a\nleaky wave. In the limit of incompressible media (for the jet and its\nenvironment) all unstable modes are non-leaky surface waves.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the Noether symmetries of a generalized\nscalar-tensor, Brans-Dicke type cosmological model, in which we consider\nexplicit scalar field dependent couplings to the Ricci scalar, and to the\nscalar field kinetic energy, respectively. We also include the scalar field\nself-interaction potential into the gravitational action. From the condition of\nthe vanishing of the Lie derivative of the gravitational cosmological\nLagrangian with respect to a given vector field we obtain three cosmological\nsolutions describing the time evolution of a spatially flat\nFriedman-Robertson-Walker Universe filled with a scalar field. The cosmological\nproperties of the solutions are investigated in detail, and it is shown that\nthey can describe a large variety of cosmological evolutions, including models\nthat experience a smooth transition from a decelerating to an accelerating\nphase.\n", "  This work deals with gravity localization on codimension-1 brane worlds\nengendered by compacton-like kinks, the so-called hybrid branes. In such\nscenarios, the thin brane behaviour is manifested when the extra dimension is\noutside the compact domain, where the energy density is non-trivial, instead of\nasymptotically as in the usual thick brane models. The zero mode is trapped in\nthe brane, as required. The massive modes, although are not localized in the\nbrane, have important phenomenological implications such as corrections to the\nNewton's law. We study such corrections in the usual thick domain wall and in\nthe hybrid brane scenarios. By means of suitable numerical methods, we attain\nthe mass spectrum for the graviton and the corresponding wavefunctions. The\nspectra possess the usual linearly increasing behaviour from the Kaluza-Klein\ntheories. Further, we show that the 4D gravitational force is slightly\nincreased at short distances. The first eigenstate contributes highly for the\ncorrection to the Newton's law. The subsequent normalized solutions have\ndiminishing contributions. Moreover, we find out that the phenomenology of the\nhybrid brane is not different from the usual thick domain wall. The use of\nnumerical techniques for solving the equations of the massive modes is useful\nfor matching possible phenomenological measurements in the gravitational law as\na probe to warped extra dimensions.\n", "  The high-ionization lines of the broad-line region (BLR) of thermal active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) show blueshifts of a few hundred km/s to several\nthousand km/sec with respect to the low-ionization lines. This has long been\nthought to be due to the high-ionization lines of the BLR arising in a wind of\nwhich the far side of the outflow is blocked from our view by the accretion\ndisc. Evidence for and against the disc-wind model is discussed. The biggest\nproblem for the model is that velocity-resolved reverberation mapping\nrepeatedly fails to show the expected kinematic signature of outflow of the\nBLR. The disc-wind model also cannot readily reproduce the red side of the line\nprofiles of high-ionization lines. The rapidly falling density in an outflow\nmakes it difficult to obtain high equivalent widths. We point out a number of\nmajor problems with associating the BLR with the outflows producing broad\nabsorption lines. An explanation which avoids all these problems and satisfies\nthe constraints of both the line profiles and velocity-resolved\nreverberation-mapping is a model in which the blueshifting is due to scattering\noff material spiraling inwards with an inflow velocity of half the velocity of\nthe blueshifting. We discuss how recent reverberation mapping results are\nconsistent with the scattering-plus-inflow model but do not support a disc-wind\nmodel. We propose that the anti-correlation of the apparent redshifting of\nH$\\beta$ with the blueshifting of CIV is a consequence of contamination of the\nred wings of H$\\beta$ by the broad wings of [O III].\n", "  The Fock representation of the Q-operator algebra for the diagonal WZNW model\non SU(n) at level k, where Q is the matrix of the 2D WZNW \"zero modes\"\ngenerating certain dynamical quantum group, is finite dimensional and has a\nnatural basis labeled by su(n) Young diagrams Y of \"spread\" not exceeding h :=\nk+n (spr (Y) = #(columns) + #(rows))\n", "  A third parameter, in addition to luminosity and rate of brightness decline,\nderived from the spectra of transients is suggested as a means of more\naccurately classifying objects in outburst. Principal component analysis of the\nspectra of transients is suggested as the best way to determine the third\nparameter. A model is suggested for novae ejecta that is based on ballistic\nejection of an ensemble of globules. The distribution in sizes of the clouds\nshould determine basic characteristics of the ejecta, including the short term\nbrightness fluctuations of novae in decline and the location of dust formation.\n", "  We explore the geometric interpretation of a diabatic, two-photon Raman\nprocess as a rotation on the Bloch sphere for a pseudo-spin-1/2 system. The\nspin state of a spin-1/2 quantum system can be described by a point on the\nsurface of the Bloch sphere, and its evolution during a Raman pulse is a\ntrajectory on the sphere determined by properties of the optical beams: the\npulse area, the relative intensities and phases, and the relative frequencies.\nWe experimentally demonstrate key features of this model with a $^{87}$Rb\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which allows us to examine spatially dependent\nsignatures of the Raman beams. The two-photon detuning allows us to precisely\ncontrol the spin density and imprinted relative phase profiles, as we show with\na coreless vortex. With this comprehensive understanding and intuitive\ngeometric interpretation, we use the Raman process to create and tailor as well\nas study and characterize exotic topological spin textures in spinor BECs.\n", "  In this paper, new determined BVR_cI_c light curves and radial velocities of\nV781 Tau are presented. By analyzing the light curves and radial velocities\nsimultaneously, we found that V781 Tau is a W-subtype medium contact binary\nstar with a mass ratio of q=2.207+-0.005 and a contact degree of\nf=21.6(+-1.0)%. The difference between the two light maxima was explained by a\ndark spot on the less massive primary component. The orbital period change of\nV781 Tau was also investigated. A secular decrease at a rate of\n$-6.01(+-2.28)*10^{-8} d/yr and a cyclic modulation with a period of 44.8+-5.7\nyr and an amplitude of 0.0064+-0.0011 day were discovered. The continuous\nperiod decrease may be caused by angular momentum loss due to magnetic stellar\nwind. Applegate mechanism failed to explain the cyclic modulation. It is highly\npossible that the cyclic oscillation is the result of the light travel time\neffect by a third companion.\n", "  Surface tension is a macroscopic manifestation of the cohesion of matter, and\nits value $\\sigma_\\infty$ is readily measured for a flat liquid-vapor\ninterface. For interfaces with a small radius of curvature $R$, the surface\ntension might differ from $\\sigma_\\infty$. The Tolman equation, $\\sigma(R) =\n\\sigma_\\infty / (1 + 2 \\delta/R)$, with $\\delta$ a constant length, is commonly\nused to describe nanoscale phenomena such as nucleation. Here we report\nexperiments on nucleation of bubbles in ethanol and n-heptane, and their\nanalysis in combination with their counterparts for the nucleation of droplets\nin supersaturated vapors, and with water data. We show that neither a constant\nsurface tension nor the Tolman equation can consistently describe the data. We\nalso investigate a model including $1/R$ and $1/R^2$ terms in $\\sigma(R)$. We\ndescribe a general procedure to obtain the coefficients of these terms from\ndetailed nucleation experiments. This work explains the conflicting values\nobtained for the Tolman length in previous analyses, and suggests directions\nfor future work.\n", "  This article provides a synopsis of our recent experimental work exploring\nBose-Einstein condensation in metastable higher Bloch bands of optical\nlattices. Bipartite lattice geometries have allowed us to implement appropriate\nband structures, which meet three basic requirements: the existence of\nmetastable excited states sufficiently protected from collisional band\nrelaxation, a mechanism to excite the atoms initially prepared in the lowest\nband with moderate entropy increase, and the possibility of cross-dimensional\ntunneling dynamics, necessary to establish coherence along all lattice axes. A\nvariety of bands can be selectively populated and a subsequent thermalisation\nprocess leads to the formation of a condensate in the lowest energy state of\nthe chosen band. As examples the 2nd, 4th and 7th bands in a bipartite square\nlattice are discussed. In the 2nd and 7th band, the band geometry can be tuned\nsuch that two inequivalent energetically degenerate energy minima arise at the\n$X_{\\pm}$-points at the edge of the 1st Brillouin zone. In this case even a\nsmall interaction energy is sufficient to lock the phase between the two\ncondensation points such that a complex-valued chiral superfluid order\nparameter can emerge, which breaks time reversal symmetry. In the 4th band a\ncondensate can be formed in the $\\Gamma$-point in the center of the 1st\nBrillouin zone, which can be used to explore topologically protected band\ntouching points. The new techniques to access orbital degrees of freedom in\nhigher bands greatly extend the class of many-body scenarios that can be\nexplored with bosons in optical lattices.\n", "  We study X-ray and UV emission from the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy\nII~Zw~177 using a $137\\ks$ long and another $13\\ks$ short \\xmm{} observation\nperformed in 2012 and 2001, respectively. Both observations show soft X-ray\nexcess emission contributing $76.9\\pm4.9\\%$ in 2012 and $58.8\\pm10.2\\%$ in 2001\nin the $0.3-2\\kev$ band. We find that both blurred reflection from an ionized\ndisc and Comptonized disc emission describe the observed soft excess well.\nTime-resolved spectroscopy on scales of $\\sim20\\ks$ reveals strong correlation\nbetween the soft excess and the powerlaw components. The fractional variability\namplitude $F_{var}$ derived from EPIC-pn lightcurves at different energy bands\nis nearly constant ($F_{var} \\sim20\\%$). This is in contrast to other AGNs\nwhere the lack of short term variation in soft X-ray excess emission has been\nattributed to intense light bending in the framework of the \"lamppost\" model.\nThus, the variations in powerlaw emission are most likely intrinsic to corona\nrather than just due to the changes of height of compact corona. The variable\nUV emission ($F_{var} \\sim 1\\%$) is uncorrelated to any of the X-ray components\non short timescales suggesting that the UV emission is not dominated by the\nreprocessed emission. The gradual observed decline in the UV emission in 2012\nmay be related to the secular decline due to the changes in the accretion rate.\nIn this case, the short term X-ray variability is not due to the changes in the\nseed photons but intrinsic to the hot corona.\n", "  Aims: Using the unprecedented combination of high resolution and sensitivity\noffered by ALMA, we aim to investigate whether and how hot corinos,\ncircumstellar disks, and ejected gas are related in young solar-mass\nprotostars. Methods: We observed CH$_3$CHO and deuterated water (HDO)\nhigh-excitation ($E_{\\rm u}$ up to 335 K) lines towards the Sun-like protostar\nHH212--MM1. Results: For the first time, we have obtained images of CH$_3$CHO\nand HDO emission in the inner $\\simeq$ 100 AU of HH212. The multifrequency line\nanalysis allows us to contrain the density ($\\geq$ 10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$),\ntemperature ($\\simeq$ 100 K), and CH$_3$CHO abundance ($\\simeq$ 0.2--2 $\\times$\n10$^{-9}$) of the emitting region. The HDO profile is asymmetric at low\nvelocities ($\\leq$ 2 km s$^{-1}$ from $V_{\\rm sys}$). If the HDO line is\noptically thick, this points to an extremely small ($\\sim$ 20--40 AU) and dense\n($\\ge$ 10$^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$) emitting region. Conclusions: We report the first\ndetection of a hot corino in Orion. The HDO asymmetric profile indicates a\ncontribution of outflowing gas from the compact central region, possibly\nassociated with a dense disk wind.\n", "  We discuss the application of the Hojman's Symmetry Approach for the\ndetermination of conservation laws in Cosmology, which has been recently\napplied by various authors in different cosmological models. We show that\nHojman's method for regular Hamiltonian systems, where the Hamiltonian function\nis one of the involved equations of the system, is equivalent to the\napplication of Noether's Theorem for generalized transformations. That means\nthat for minimally-coupled scalar field cosmology or other modified theories\nwhich are conformally related with scalar-field cosmology, like $f(R)$ gravity,\nthe application of Hojman's method provide us with the same results with that\nof Noether's theorem. Moreover we study the special Ansatz. $\\phi\\left(\nt\\right) =\\phi\\left( a\\left( t\\right) \\right) $, which has been introduced for\na minimally-coupled scalar field, and we study the Lie and Noether point\nsymmetries for the reduced equation. We show that under this Ansatz, the\nunknown function of the model cannot be constrained by the requirement of the\nexistence of a conservation law and that the Hojman conservation quantity which\narises for the reduced equation is nothing more than the functional form of\nNoetherian conservation laws for the free particle. On the other hand, for\n$f(T)$ teleparallel gravity, it is not the existence of Hojman's conservation\nlaws which provide us with the special function form of $f(T)$ functions, but\nthe requirement that the reduced second-order differential equation admits a\nJacobi Last multiplier, while the new conservation law is nothing else that the\nHamiltonian function of the reduced equation.\n", "  We examine the plasma composition of relativistic jets in four FRII radio\ngalaxies by analyzing the total cocoon pressure in terms of partial pressures\nof thermal and non-thermal electrons/positrons and protons. The total cocoon\npressure is determined by cocoon dynamics via comparison of theoretical model\nwith the observed cocoon shape. By inserting the observed number density of\nnon-thermal electrons/positrons and the upper limit of thermal\nelectron/positron number density into the equation of state, the number density\nof protons is constrained. We apply this method to four FRII radio galaxies\n(Cygnus A, 3C 219, 3C 223 and 3C 284), for which the total cocoon pressures\nhave been already evaluated. We find that the positron-free plasma comprising\nof protons and electrons is ruled out, when we consider plausible particle\ndistribution functions. In other words, the mixture of positrons is required\nfor all four FRII radio galaxies; the number density ratio of\nelectrons/positrons to protons is larger than two. Thus, we find that the\nplasma composition is independent of the jet power and the size of cocoons. We\nalso investigate the additional contribution of thermal electrons/positrons and\nprotons on the cocoon dynamics. When thermal electrons/positrons are absent,\nthe cocoon is supported by the electron/ proton plasma pressure, while both\nelectron/positron pressure supported and electron/proton plasma pressure\nsupported cocoons are allowed if the number density of thermal\nelectrons/positrons is about 10 times larger than that of non-thermal ones.\n", "  Optical and NIR observations of the type Ia supernova SN 2014J in M82 are\npresented. The observed light curves are found to be similar to normal SNe Ia,\nwith a decline rate parameter $\\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.08 \\pm 0.03$. The supernova\nreached $B$-band maximum on JD 2456690.14, at an apparent magnitude $m_B(max) =\n11.94$. The optical spectra show a red continuum with deep interstellar Na~{\\sc\ni} absorption, but otherwise resemble those of normal SNe Ia. The Si~{\\sc ii}\n$\\lambda 6355$ feature indicates a velocity of $\\sim 12\\,000$ km s$^{-1}$ at\n$B$-band maximum, which places SN 2014J at the border of the Normal Velocity\nand High Velocity group of SNe Ia. The velocity evolution of SN 2014J places it\nin the Low Velocity Gradient subclass, whereas the equivalent widths of Si~{\\sc\nii} features near $B$-band maximum place it at the border of the Core Normal\nand Broad Line subclasses of SNe Ia. An analytic model fit to the bolometric\nlight curve indicates that a total of $\\sim 1.3$ M$_{\\odot}$ was ejected in the\nexplosion, and the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass $M_{Ni} \\sim 0.6$ M$_{\\odot}$. The\nlow [Fe~{\\sc iii}] $\\lambda4701$ to [Fe~{\\sc ii}] $\\lambda5200$ ratio in the\nnebular spectra of SN 2014J hints towards clumpiness in the ejecta. Optical\nbroadband, linear polarimetric observations of SN 2014J obtained on four epochs\nindicate an almost constant polarization ($P_{\\rm R} \\sim$2.7 per cent;\n$\\theta$ $\\sim$37$^\\circ$), which suggests that the polarization signal is of\ninterstellar origin.\n", "  Context. The existence of a significant population of Ap stars with very long\nrotation periods (up to several hundred years) has progressively emerged over\nthe past two decades. However, only lower limits of the periods are known for\nmost of them because their variations have not yet been observed over a\nsufficient timebase.\n  Aims. We determine the rotation period of the slowly rotating Ap star HD\n18078 and we derive constraints on the geometrical structure of its magnetic\nfield.\n  Methods. We combine measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus obtained\nfrom 1990 to 1997 with determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field\nspanning the 1999-2007 time interval to derive an unambiguous value of the\nrotation period. We show that this value is consistent with photometric\nvariations recorded in the Stroemgren uvby photometric system between 1995 and\n2004. We fit the variations of the two above-mentioned field moments with a\nsimple model to constrain the magnetic structure.\n  Results. The rotation period of HD 18078 is (1358 +/- 12) d. The geometrical\nstructure of its magnetic field is consistent to first order with a colinear\nmultipole model whose axis is offset from the centre of the star.\n  Conclusions. HD 18078 is only the fifth Ap star with a rotation period longer\nthan 1000 days for which the exact value of that period (as opposed to a lower\nlimit) could be determined. The strong anharmonicity of the variations of its\nmean longitudinal magnetic field and the shift between their extrema and those\nof the mean magnetic field modulus are exceptional and indicative of a very\nunusual magnetic structure.\n", "  The progenitors of hydrogen-poor core-collapse supernovae (SNe) of types Ib,\nIc and IIb are believed to have shed their outer hydrogen envelopes either by\nextremely strong stellar winds, characteristic of classical Wolf-Rayet stars,\nor by binary interaction with a close companion star. The exact nature of the\nprogenitors and the relative importance of these processes are still open\nquestions. One relatively unexplored method to constrain the progenitors is to\nsearch for high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) at SN locations in pre-explosion\nX-ray observations. In a HMXB, one star has already exploded as a core-collapse\nSN, producing a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole. It is likely that\nthe second star in the system will also explode as a supernova, which should\ncause a detectable long-term change in the system's X-ray luminosity. In\nparticular, a pre-explosion detection of a HMXB coincident with a SN could be\ninformative about the progenitor's nature. In this paper we analyze\npre-explosion ACIS observations of 18 nearby type Ib, Ic and IIb supernovae\nfrom the Chandra X-ray observatory public archive. Two sources that could\npotentially be associated with the supernova are identified in the sample.\nAdditionally we make similar post-explosion measurements for 46 SNe. Although\nour modelling indicates that progenitor systems with compact binary companions\nare probably quite rare, studies of this type can in the future provide more\nstringent constraints as the number of discovered nearby SNe and suitable\npre-explosion X-ray data are both increasing.\n", "  We present a new, publicly available, set of Los Alamos OPLIB opacity tables\nfor the elements hydrogen through zinc. Our tables are computed using the Los\nAlamos ATOMIC opacity and plasma modeling code, and make use of atomic\nstructure calculations that use fine-structure detail for all the elements\nconsidered. Our equation-of-state (EOS) model, known as ChemEOS, is based on\nthe minimization of free energy in a chemical picture and appears to be a\nreasonable and robust approach to determining atomic state populations over a\nwide range of temperatures and densities. In this paper we discuss in detail\nthe calculations that we have performed for the 30 elements considered, and\npresent some comparisons of our monochromatic opacities with measurements and\nother opacity codes. We also use our new opacity tables in solar modeling\ncalculations and compare and contrast such modeling with previous work.\n", "  Carbon dioxide ice clouds are thought to play an important role for cold\nterrestrial planets with thick CO2 dominated atmospheres. Various previous\nstudies showed that a scattering greenhouse effect by carbon dioxide ice clouds\ncould result in a massive warming of the planetary surface. However, all of\nthese studies only employed simplified two-stream radiative transfer schemes to\ndescribe the anisotropic scattering. Using accurate radiative transfer models\nwith a general discrete ordinate method, this study revisits this important\neffect and shows that the positive climatic impact of carbon dioxide clouds was\nstrongly overestimated in the past. The revised scattering greenhouse effect\ncan have important implications for the early Mars, but also for planets like\nthe early Earth or the position of the outer boundary of the habitable zone.\n", "  We introduce an improvement to a periodicity metric we have introduced in a\nprevious paper.We improve on the Hoeffding-test periodicity metric, using the\nBlum-Kiefer-Rosenblatt (BKR) test. Besides a consistent improvement over the\nHoeffding-test approach, the BKR approach turns out to perform superbly when\napplied to very short time series of sawtoothlike shapes. The expected\nastronomical implications are much more detections of RR-Lyrae stars and\nCepheids in sparse photometric databases, and of eccentric Keplerian\nradial-velocity (RV) curves, such as those of exoplanets in RV surveys.\n", "  The distribution of young open clusters in the Galactic plane within 3 kpc\nfrom the Sun suggests the existence of the outer ring R1R2' in the Galaxy. The\noptimum value of the solar position angle with respect to the major axis of the\nbar, theta_b, providing the best agreement between the distribution of open\nclusters and model particles is theta_b=35 +/- 10 degrees. The kinematical\nfeatures obtained for young open clusters and OB-associations with negative\nGalactocentric radial velocity VR indicate the solar location near the\ndescending segment of the outer ring R2.\n", "  This Letter presents a new, remarkably simple diagnostic specifically\ndesigned to derive chemical abundances for high redshift galaxies. It uses only\nthe H \\alpha, [N II] and [S II] emission lines, which can usually be observed\nin a single gating stetting, and is almost linear up to an abundance of 12+log\n(O/H) = 9.05. It can be used over the full abundance range encountered in high\nredshift galaxies. By its use of emission lines located close together in\nwavelength, it is also independent of reddening. Our diagnostic depends\ncritically on the calibration of the N/O ratio. However, by using realistic\nstellar atmospheres combined with the N/O vs. O/H abundance calibration derived\nlocally from stars and H II regions, and allowing for the fact that\nhigh-redshift H II regions have both high ionisation parameters \\emph{and} high\ngas pressures, we find that the observations of high-redshift galaxies can be\nsimply explained by the models without having to invoke arbitrary changes in\nN/O ratio, or the presence of unusual quantities of Wolf-Rayet stars in these\ngalaxies.\n", "  Context. Despite the thorough work of van Leeuwen (2007), the parallax of\nalpha Centauri is still far from being carved in stone. Any derivation of the\nindividual masses is therefore uncertain, if not questionable. And yet, that\ndoes not prevent this system from being used for calibration purpose in several\nstudies. Aims. Obtaining more accurate model-free parallax and individual\nmasses of this system. Methods. With HARPS, the radial velocities are not only\nprecise but also accurate. Ten years of HARPS data are enough to derive the\ncomplement of the visual orbit for a full 3D orbit of alpha Cen. Results. We\nlocate alpha Cen (743 mas) right where Hipparcos (ESA 1997) had put it, i.e.\nslightly further away than derived by Soderhjelm (1999). The components are\nthus a bit more massive than previously thought (1.13 and 0.97 Msun for A and B\nrespectively). These values are now in excellent agreement with the latest\nasteroseismologic results.\n", "  The TeV binary system LS I +61$^\\circ$ 303 is known for its regular,\nnon-thermal emission pattern which traces the orbital period of the compact\nobject in its 26.5 day orbit around its B0 Ve star companion. The system\ntypically presents elevated TeV emission around apastron passage with flux\nlevels between 5% and 15% of the steady flux from the Crab Nebula (> 300 GeV).\nIn this article, VERITAS observations of LS I +61$^\\circ$ 303 taken in late\n2014 are presented, during which bright TeV flares around apastron at flux\nlevels peaking above 30% of the Crab Nebula flux were detected. This is the\nbrightest such activity from this source ever seen in the TeV regime. The\nstrong outbursts have rise and fall times of less than a day. The short\ntimescale of the flares, in conjunction with the observation of 10 TeV photons\nfrom LS I +61$^\\circ$ 303 during the flares, provides constraints on the\nproperties of the accelerator in the source.\n", "  Stellar structure calculations are able to predict precisely the properties\nof stars during their evolution. However, convection is still modelled by the\nmixing length theory; therefore, the upper boundary conditions near the optical\nsurface do not agree with asteroseismic observations. We want to improve how\nthe outer boundary conditions are determined in stellar structure calculations.\nWe study realistic 3D stellar atmosphere models to find alternative properties.\nWe find that the asymptotic entropy run of the superadiabatic convective\nsurface layers exhibit a distinct universal stratification when normalised by\nthe entropy minimum and jump. The normalised entropy can be represented by a\n5th order polynomial very accurately, and a 3rd order polynomial also yields\naccurate coefficients. This generic entropy stratification or the solar\nstratification, when scaled by the entropy jump and minimum, can be used to\nimprove the modelling of superadiabatic surface layers in stellar structure\ncalculations. Furthermore, this finding indicates that surface convection\noperates in the same way for all cool stars, but requires further scrutiny in\norder to improve our understanding of stellar atmospheres.\n", "  Context: We present a newly discovered class of low-luminosity, dusty,\nevolved objects in the Magellanic Clouds. These objects have dust excesses,\nstellar parameters, and spectral energy distributions similar to those of dusty\npost-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars. However, they have lower\nluminosities and hence lower masses. We suggest that they have evolved off the\nred giant branch (RGB) instead of the AGB as a result of binary interaction.\nAims: In this study we aim to place these objects in an evolutionary context\nand establish an evolutionary connection between RGB binaries (such as the\nsequence E variables) and our new sample of objects. Methods: We compared the\ntheoretically predicted birthrates of the progeny of RGB binaries to the\nobservational birthrates of the new sample of objects. Results: We find that\nthere is order-of-magnitude agreement between the observed and predicted\nbirthrates of post-RGB stars. The sources of uncertainty in the birthrates are\ndiscussed; the most important sources are probably the observational\nincompleteness factor and the post-RGB evolution rates. We also note that\nmergers are relatively common low on the RGB and that stars low on the RGB with\nmid-IR excesses may recently have undergone a merger. Conclusions: Our sample\nof dusty post-RGB stars most likely provides the first observational evidence\nfor a newly discovered phase in binary evolution: post-RGB binaries with\ncircumstellar dust.\n", "  Context. This observational paper has been prepared in the context of the\nlarge multi-wavelength effort by many observers with the aim of following up\nthe transient flaring event of V404 Cygni that took place for several weeks in\n2015 June. Aims. Our main original aim was to contribute to the study of this\ntransient source by acquiring broad-band photometric observations during its\nmost active flaring phases. Nevertheless, after a detailed analysis of the\ndata, several interesting results were obtained that encouraged a dedicated\npublication. Methods. The methodology used was based on broad-band differential\nCCD photometry. This outburst of V404 Cygni rendered the source a very bright\ntarget easily within reach of small educational telescopes. Therefore, the 41\ncm telescope available at the Astronomical Observatory of the University of\nJa\\'en was used in this work. Results. We detected variability at different\ntime scales, both in amplitude and colour. Individual optical flares appear\nevery half hour on average during our 3 h long observation, although\nlarge-amplitude (\\sim 1 mag) variations are also observed to occur on intervals\nas short as 10 minutes. Also, colour variations appear to be highly correlated\nin a colour-colour diagram. Another remarkable finding is the detection of time\nlag, from about one to a fraction of a minute between light curves in different\nfilters (VRcIc). Conclusions. The observed behaviour is tentatively interpreted\nin an scenario based on the ejection of non-thermal emitting, relativistic\nplasmons, with their synchrotron spectra extending up to optical wavelengths.\nThis would render some of the V404 Cygni flares very similar to those of the\nwell-know microquasar GRS 1915+105\n", "  Consider a family of collinear, equilateral triangular holes of any even side\nlength lying within a sea of unit rhombi. The results presented below show that\nas the distance between the holes grows large, the interaction between them may\nbe approximated, up to a multiplicative constant, by taking the exponential of\nthe negative of the electrostatic energy of the system obtained by viewing the\nholes as a set of point charges, each with a signed magnitude given by a\ncertain statistic. Furthermore it is shown that the interaction between a\nfamily of left pointing collinear triangular holes and a free boundary may be\napproximated (again up to some multiplicative constant) by taking the\nexponential of the negative of the electrostatic energy of the system obtained\nby considering the holes as a set of point charges and the boundary a straight\nequipotential conductor. These two differing systems of point charges can be\nrelated via the method of image charges, a well-known physical law that also\nsurfaces in the following mathematical analysis of enumeration formulas that\ncount tilings of certain regions of the plane by unit rhombi.\n", "  We present the first measurement of individual cluster mass estimates using\nweak lensing size and flux magnification. Using data from the HST-STAGES survey\nof the A901/902 supercluster we detect the four known groups in the\nsupercluster at high significance using magnification alone. We discuss the\napplication of a fully Bayesian inference analysis, and investigate a broad\nrange of potential systematics in the application of the method. We compare our\nresults to a previous weak lensing shear analysis of the same field finding the\nrecovered signal-to-noise of our magnification-only analysis to range from 45%\nto 110% of the signal-to-noise in the shear-only analysis. On a case-by-case\nbasis we find consistent magnification and shear constraints on cluster virial\nradius, and finding that for the full sample, magnification constraints to be a\nfactor $0.77 \\pm 0.18$ lower than the shear measurements.\n", "  The colour-magnitude diagrams of some intermediate-age clusters (1-2 Gyr)\nstar clusters show unexpectedly broad main-sequence turnoffs, raising the\npossibility that these clusters have experienced more than one episode of star\nformation. Such a scenario predicts the existence of an extended main sequence\nturn off (eMSTO) only in clusters with escape velocities above a certain\nthreshold ($>15$ km s$^{-1}$), which would allow them to retain or accrete gas\nthat eventually would fuel a secondary extended star-formation episode. This\npaper presents a test of this scenario based on the study of the young and\nmassive cluster NGC 7252: W3. We use the HST photometry from WFPC2 and WFC3\nimages obtained with UV and optical filters, as well as MagE echellette\nspectrograph data from the Las Campanas Clay 6.5m telescope, in order to\nconstruct the observed UV/optical SED of NGC 7252: W3. The observations are\nthen compared with synthetic spectra based on different star formation\nhistories consistent with those of the eMSTO clusters. We find that the SED of\nthis cluster is best fitted by a synthetic spectrum with a single stellar\npopulation of age $570^{+70}_{-62}$ Myr and mass $1.13^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\\times\n10^8$ M$_\\odot$, confirming earlier works on NGC 7252: W3. We also estimate the\nlower limit on the central escape velocity of 193 km s$^{-1}$. We rule out\nextended star-formation histories, like those inferred for the eMSTO clusters\nin the Magellanic Clouds, at high confidence. We conclude that the escape\nvelocity of a cluster does not dictate whether a cluster can undergo extended\nperiods of star formation.\n", "  We study the dynamics of two gray solitons in a Bose-Einstein condensate\nconfined by a toroidal trap with a tight confinement in the radial direction.\nGross-Pitaevskii simulations show that solitons can be long living objects\npassing through many collisional processes. We have observed quite different\nbehaviors depending on the soliton velocity. Very slow solitons, obtained by\nperturbing the stationary solitonic profile, move with a constant angular\nvelocity until they collide elastically and move in the opposite direction\nwithout showing any sign of lowering their energy. In this case the density\nnotches are always well separated and the fronts are sharp and straight. Faster\nsolitons present vortices around the notches, which play a central role during\nthe collisions. We have found that in these processes the solitons lose energy,\nas the outgoing velocity turns out to be larger than the incoming one. To study\nthe dynamics, we model the gray soliton state with a free parameter that is\nrelated to the soliton velocity. We further analyze the energy, soliton\nvelocity and turning points in terms of such a free parameter, finding that the\nmain features are in accordance with the infinite one-dimensional system.\n", "  Here we present a short overview and main results of our investigations of\nseveral effects which can induce shifts in the broad Fe K$\\alpha$ line emitted\nfrom relativistic accretion disks around single and binary supermassive black\nholes. We used numerical simulations based on ray-tracing method in the Kerr\nmetric to study the role of classical Doppler shift, special relativistic\ntransverse Doppler shift and Doppler beaming, general relativistic\ngravitational redshift, and perturbations of the disk emissivity in the\nformation of the observed Fe K$\\alpha$ line profiles. Besides, we also\ninvestigated whether the observed line profiles from the binary systems of\nsupermassive black holes could be affected by the Doppler shifts due to\ndynamics of such systems. The presented results demonstrate that all these\neffects could have a significant influence on the observed profiles of the\nbroad Fe K$\\alpha$ line emitted from relativistic accretion disks around single\nand binary supermassive black holes.\n", "  Luminous type-2 quasars in which the glow from the central black hole is\nobscured by dust are ideal targets for studying their host galaxies and the\nquasars' effect on galaxy evolution. Such feedback appears ubiquitous in\nluminous obscured quasars where high velocity ionized nebulae have been found.\nWe present rest-frame yellow-band (~5000 Angstroms) observations using the\nHubble Space Telescope for a sample of 20 luminous quasar host galaxies at 0.2\n< z < 0.6 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For the first time, we\ncombine host galaxy observations with geometric measurements of quasar\nillumination using blue-band HST observations and [OIII] integral field unit\nobservations probing the quasar winds. The HST images reveal bright merger\nsignatures in about half the galaxies; a significantly higher fraction than in\ncomparison inactive ellipticals. We show that the host galaxies are primarily\nbulge-dominated, with masses close to M*, but belong to < 30% of elliptical\ngalaxies that are highly star-forming at z ~ 0.5. Ionized gas signatures are\nuncorrelated with faint stellar disks (if present), confirming that the ionized\ngas is not concentrated in a disk. Scattering cones and [OIII] ionized gas\nvelocity field are aligned with the forward scattering cones being co-spatial\nwith the blue-shifted side of the velocity field, suggesting the high velocity\ngas is indeed photo-ionized by the quasar. Based on the host galaxies' high\nstar-formation rates and bright merger signatures, we suggest that this\nlow-redshift outbreak of luminous quasar activity is triggered by recent minor\nmergers. Combining these novel observations, we present new quasar unification\ntests, which are in agreement with expectations of the orientation-based\nunification model for quasars.\n", "  Recent interpretations of narrow, variable absorption lines detected in some\nType Ia supernovae suggest that their progenitors are surrounded by dense,\ncircumstellar material. Similar variations detected in the symbiotic recurrent\nnova system RS Oph, which undergoes thermonuclear outbursts every ~20 years,\nmaking it an ideal candidate to investigate the origin of these lines. To this\nend, we present simulations of multiple mass transfer-nova cycles in RS Oph. We\nfind that the quiescent mass transfer produces a dense, equatorial outflow,\ni.e., concentrated towards the binary orbital plane, and an accretion disc\nforms around the white dwarf. The interaction of a spherical nova outburst with\nthese aspherical circumstellar structures produces a bipolar outflow, similar\nto that seen in HST imaging of the 2006 outburst. In order to produce an\nionization structure that is consistent with observations, a mass-loss rate of\n$5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ from the red giant is\nrequired. The simulations also produce a polar accretion flow, which may\nexplain the broad wings of the quiescent H {\\alpha} line and hard X-rays. By\ncomparing simulated absorption line profiles to observations of the 2006\noutburst, we are able to determine which components arise in the wind and which\nare due to the novae. We explore the possible behaviour of absorption line\nprofiles as they may appear should a supernova occur in a system like RS Oph.\nOur models show similarities to supernovae like SN 2006X, but require a high\nmass-loss rate, $\\dot{M} \\sim 10^{-6}$ to\n$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, to explain the variability in SN\n2006X.\n", "  Currently, there are 24 black hole (BH) X-ray binary systems that have been\ndynamically confirmed in the Galaxy. Most of them are low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs) comprised of a stellar-mass BH and a low-mass donor star. Although the\nformation of these systems has been extensively investigated, some crucial\nissues remain unresolved. The most noticeable one is that, the low-mass\ncompanion has difficulties in ejecting the tightly bound envelope of the\nmassive primary during the spiral-in process. While initially intermediate-mass\nbinaries are more likely to survive the common envelope (CE) evolution, the\nresultant BH LMXBs mismatch the observations. In this paper, we use both\nstellar evolution and binary population synthesis to study the evolutionary\nhistory of BH LMXBs. We test various assumptions and prescriptions for the\nsupernova mechanisms that produce BHs, the binding energy parameter, the CE\nefficiency, and the initial mass distributions of the companion stars. We\nobtain the birthrate and the distributions of the donor mass, effective\ntemperature and orbital period for the BH LMXBs in each case. By comparing the\ncalculated results with the observations, we put useful constraints on the\naforementioned parameters. In particular, we show that it is possible to form\nBH LMXBs with the standard CE scenario if most BHs are born through failed\nsupernovae.\n", "  The use of background quasars provides a powerful tool to probe the cool gas\nin the circum-galactic medium of foreground galaxies. Here, we present new\nobservations with SINFONI and X-Shooter of absorbing-galaxy candidates at\nz=0.7-1. We report the detection with both instruments of the H-alpha emission\nline of one sub-DLA at z_abs=0.94187 with log N(HI)=19.38^+0.10_-0.15 towards\nSDSS J002133.27+004300.9. We estimate the star formation rate: SFR=3.6+/-2.2\nsolar masses per year in that system. A detailed kinematic study indicates a\ndynamical mass M_dyn=10^9.9+/-0.4 solar masses and a halo mass\nM_halo=10^11.9+/-0.5 solar masses. In addition, we report the OII detection\nwith X-Shooter of another DLA at z_abs=0.7402 with log N(HI)=20.4+/-0.1 toward\nQ0052+0041 and an estimated SFR of 5.3+/-0.7 solar masses per year. Three other\nobjects are detected in the continuum with X-Shooter but the nature and\nredshift of two of these objects are unconstrained due to the absence of\nemission lines, while the third object might be at the redshift of the quasar.\nWe use the objects detected in our whole N(HI)-selected SINFONI survey to\ncompute the metallicity difference between the galaxy and the absorbing gas,\ndelta_HI(X), where a positive (negative) value indicates infall (outflow). We\ncompare this quantity with the quasar line of sight alignment with the galaxy's\nmajor (minor) axis, another tracer of infall (outflow). We find that these\nquantities do not correlate as expected from simple assumptions. Additional\nobservations are necessary to relate these two independent probes of gas flows\naround galaxies.\n", "  We present the first dust emission results toward a sample of seven\nprotostellar disk candidates around Class 0 and I sources in the Perseus\nmolecular cloud from the VLA Nascent Disk and Multiplicity (VANDAM) survey with\n~0.05'' or 12 AU resolution. To examine the surface brightness profiles of\nthese sources, we fit the Ka-band 8 mm dust-continuum data in the u,v-plane to\na simple, parametrized model based on the Shakura-Sunyaev disk model. The\ncandidate disks are well-fit by a model with a disk-shaped profile and have\nmasses consistent with known Class 0 and I disks. The inner-disk surface\ndensities of the VANDAM candidate disks have shallower density profiles\ncompared to disks around more evolved Class II systems. The best-fit model\nradii of the seven early-result candidate disks are R_c > 10 AU; at 8 mm, the\nradii reflect lower limits on the disk size since dust continuum emission is\ntied to grain size and large grains radially drift inwards. These relatively\nlarge disks, if confirmed kinematically, are inconsistent with theoretical\nmodels where the disk size is limited by strong magnetic braking to < 10 AU at\nearly times.\n", "  A relationship between the water maser detection rate and large nuclear\ncolumn densities in AGN has often been cited in the literature. Indeed,\ndetailed studies of luminous water masers, typically associated with the\nnuclear activity, allow us to investigate the innermost regions of AGN, with an\nimpact on the still debated Unified Model for this class of objects.We have\nrecently entertained a search for maser emission in a well-defined sample of\nCompton-thick AGN aimed at investigating, on firm statistical bases, the\naforementioned relationship. While the survey is still ongoing, and is matter\nof a forthcoming publication, a new luminous water maser has been detected in\nthe lenticular (field) S0 galaxy IRAS15480-0344, whose origin, associated with\nan accretion disc or a nuclear outflow/jet, needs to be assessed. Multi-epoch\nsingle-dish observations and VLBI measurements were performed to investigate\nthe distribution, spatial extension, and variability of the maser emission in\norder to infer the main characteristics of the water megamaser. The new\ndetection in IRAS15480-0344 is reported: a megamaser with a total single-dish\nisotropic luminosity of ~200 Lsun and a profile composed of two main features,\na broad line with a full width to half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of ~90 km/s and\na narrow (FWHM<1 km/s) one. We performed a follow-up to the detection with the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and confidently detected only the narrow\ncomponent, which is coincident with the nuclear radio continuum emission\ndetected with the Very Large Array at 8.4 GHz. A weak narrow feature has also\nbeen detected in the velocity range of the broad feature and is located 15 pc\nto the north-west with respect to the stronger component. Neither maser spot is\nassociated with the compact radio continuum sources derived from the same VLBA\ndataset. [Abridged]\n", "  The admitted, conventional scenario to explain the complex spectral evolution\nof brown dwarfs (BD) since their first detections twenty years ago, has always\nbeen the key role played by micron-size condensates, called \"dust\" or \"clouds\",\nin their atmosphere. This scenario, however, faces major problems, in\nparticular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L\nto T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this\ntransition is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new, completely different\nexplanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution,\nwithout the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the\nCO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and\nEGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature\nto the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and\nat the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy\ntransport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the\nobserved increase in near infrared J-H and J-K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs,\nwhile a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the\nCO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles,\nand provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition. This new picture\nleads to a drastic revision of our understanding of BD and EGP atmospheres and\ntheir evolution.\n", "  We study accretion rates during the gravitational wave-driven merger of a\nbinary supermassive black hole embedded in an accretion disc, formed by gas\ndriven to the centre of the galaxy. We use 3D simulations performed with\nPHANTOM, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code. Contrary to previous\ninvestigations, we show that there is evidence of a \"squeezing phenomenon\",\ncaused by the compression of the inner disc gas when the secondary black hole\nspirals towards the primary. This causes an increase in the accretion rates\nthat always exceed the Eddington rate. We have studied the main features of the\nphenomenon for a mass ratio $q = 10^{-3}$ between the black holes, including\nthe effects of numerical resolution, the secondary accretion radius and the\ndisc thickness. With our disc model with a low aspect ratio, we show that the\nmass expelled from the orbit of the secondary is negligible ($< 5\\%$ of the\ninitial disc mass), different to the findings of previous 2D simulations with\nthicker discs. The increase in the accretion rates in the last stages of the\nmerger leads to an increase in luminosity, making it possible to detect an\nelectromagnetic precursor of the gravitational wave signal emitted by the\ncoalescence.\n", "  We introduce and investigate the multiband $d-p$ model describing a IrO$_4$\nlayer (such as realized in Ba$_2$IrO$_4$) where all $34$ orbitals per unit cell\nare partly occupied, i.e., $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals at iridium and $2p$\norbitals at oxygen ions. The model takes into account anisotropic\niridium-oxygen $d-p$ and oxygen-oxygen $p-p$ hopping processes, crystal-field\nsplittings, spin-orbit coupling, and the on-site Coulomb interactions, both at\niridium and at oxygen ions. We show that the predictions based on assumed\nidealized ionic configuration (with $n_0=5+4\\times 6=29$ electrons per IrO$_4$\nunit) do not explain well the independent \\textit{ab initio} data and the\nexperimental data for Ba$_2$IrO$_4$. Instead we find that the total electron\ndensity in the $d-p$ states is smaller, $n=29-x<n_0$ ($x>0$). When we fix\n$x=1$, the predictions for the $d-p$ model become more realistic and weakly\ninsulating antiferromagnetic ground state with the moments lying within IrO$_2$\nplanes along (110) direction is found, in agreement with experiment and\n\\textit{ab initio} data. We also show that: (i) holes delocalize over the\noxygen orbitals and the electron density at iridium ions is enhanced, hence\n(ii) their $e_g$ orbitals are occupied by more than one electron and have to be\nincluded in the multiband $d-p$ model describing iridates.\n", "  We generalize the analytical investigation on the properties of $s$-wave\nholographic superconductors in the presence of Born-Infeld nonlinear\nelectrodynamics by taking the backreaction into account. We find that in the\npresence of nonlinear gauge field, one can still employ the analytical method\nwhen the backreaction is turned on. Our calculation is based on the\nSturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, which is a variational method. For the\nsystem under consideration, we obtain the relation between the critical\ntemperature and the charge density. We find that both backreaction and\nBorn-Infeld parameters decrease the critical temperature of the superconductor\nand make the condensation harder. At the ned of paper, we calculate the\ncritical exponent associated with the condensation near the critical\ntemperature and find that it has the universal value $1/2$ of the mean field\ntheory.\n", "  We present a topological recursion formula for calculating the intersection\nnumbers defined on the moduli space of open Riemann surfaces. The spectral\ncurve is $x = \\frac{1}{2}y^2$, the same as spectral curve used to calculate\nintersection numbers for closed Riemann surfaces, but the formula itself is a\nvariation of the usual Eynard-Orantin recursion. It looks like the recursion\nformula used for spectral curves of degree 3, and also includes features\npresent in $\\beta$-deformed models. The recursion formula suggests a\nconjectural refinement to the generating function that allows for\ndistinguishing intersection numbers on moduli spaces with different numbers of\nboundary components.\n", "  \"Nonconstant cohomologies\" are introduced for solutions of set-theoretical\nfour-simplex equation (FSE). While usual cohomologies lead to solutions of\nconstant quantum FSE, our \"nonconstant cohomologies\" lead to solutions of\nnonconstant quantum FSE. Computer calculations are presented showing that large\nspaces of such cohomologies exist for all Hietarinta's two-color linear\nsolutions to set-theoretical FSE. After taking a partial trace of the\ncorresponding quantum operators, combined with one additional trick, this leads\nto solutions of tetrahedron equation, including those with non-negative matrix\nelements, and not reducible to a permutation, even with cocycle multipliers.\n", "  The computation of small concise and comprehensible excited state wave\nfunctions is needed because many electronic processes occur in excited states.\nBut since the excited energies are saddle points in the Hilbert space of wave\nfunctions, the standard computational methods, based on orthogonality to lower\nlying approximants, resort to huge and incomprehensible wave functions,\notherwise, the truncated wave function is veered away from the exact. The\npresented variational principle for excited states, Fn, is demonstrated to lead\nto the correct excited eigenfunction in necessarily small truncated spaces.\nUsing Hylleraas coordinates for He 1S 1s2s, the standard method based on the\ntheorem of Hylleraas - Unheim, and MacDonald, yields misleading main orbitals\n1s1s' and needs a series expansion of 27 terms to be corrected, whereas\nminimizing Fn goes directly to the corect main orbitals, 1s2s, and can be\nadequately improved by 8 terms. Fn uses crude, rather inaccurate, lower lying\napproximants and does not need orthogonality to them. This reduces\nsignificantly the computation cost. Thus, having a correct 1st excited state\n{\\psi}1, a ground state approximant can be immediately improved toward an\northogonal to psi_1 function. Also higher lying functions can be found that\nhave the energy of psi_1, but are orthogonal to psi_1. Fn can also recognize a\nflipped root in avoided crossings: The excited state, either flipped or not,\nhas the smallest Fn. Thus, state average is unnecessary. The method is further\napplied via conventional configuration interaction to the three lowest singlet\nstates of He 1S.\n", "  We present a study of the stellar populations within the central regions of\nfour nearby barred galaxies, and use a novel technique to constrain the\nduration of bar activity. We focus on the star formation 'desert', a region\nwithin each of these galaxies where star formation appears to have been\nsuppressed by the bar. New H beta spectroscopic data are presented, and used to\nproduce spectroscopic line indices which are compared with theoretical\npredictions from population synthesis models for simple stellar populations and\ntemporally truncated star formation histories. This analysis shows that the\ndearth of star formation activity in these regions appears to have been\ncontinuing for at least 1 Gyr, with timescales of several Gyr indicated for two\nof the galaxies. This favours models in which strong bars can be long-lived\nfeatures of galaxies, but our results also indicate a significant diversity in\nstellar population ages, and hence in the implied histories of bar activity in\nthese four galaxies.\n", "  We present two-dimensional gaseous kinematics of the inner 1.2 $\\times$ 1.8\nkpc$^2$ of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC3081, from optical spectra (5600--7000\\r{A})\nobtained with the GMOS integral field spectrograph on the Gemini North\ntelescope at a spatial resolution of $\\approx$ 100pc. We have identified\ntwo-components in the line emitting gas. A narrower component (FWHM $\\approx$\n60-100km s$^{-1}$), which appears to be gas in the galaxy disk, and which shows\na distorted rotation pattern, is observed over the whole field of view. A\nbroader component (FWHM $\\approx$150-250 km s$^{-1}$) is present in the inner\n$\\approx$ 2arcsec (200pc) and shows blueshifts and redshifts in the near and\nfar sides of the galaxy, respectively, consistent with a bipolar outflow.\nAssuming this to be the case, we estimate that the mass outflow rate in ionized\ngas ($\\dot{M}_{out}$) is between 1.9 $\\times 10^{-3}$M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and\n6.9 $\\times 10^{-3}$M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The subtraction of a rotation model\nfrom the narrower component velocity field reveals a pattern of excess\nblueshifts of $\\approx$ 50km s$^{-1}$ in the far side of the galaxy and similar\nexcess redshifts in the near side, which are cospatial with a previously known\nnuclear bar. We interpret these residuals as due to gas following non-circular\norbits in the barred potential. Under the assumption that these motions may\nlead to gas inflows, we estimate an upper limit for the mass inflow rate in\nionized gas of $\\phi$ $\\approx$ 1.3 $\\times 10^{-2}$M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.\n", "  We report on van der Waals epitaxial growth, materials characterization and\nmagnetotransport experiments in crystalline nanosheets of Bismuth\nTelluro-Sulfide (BTS). Highly layered, good-quality crystalline nanosheets of\nBTS are obtained on SiO$_2$ and muscovite mica. Weak-antilocalization (WAL),\nelectron-electron interaction-driven insulating ground state and universal\nconductance fluctuations are observed in magnetotransport experiments on BTS\ndevices. Temperature, thickness and magnetic field dependence of the transport\ndata indicate the presence of two-dimensional surface states along with bulk\nconduction, in agreement with theoretical models. An extended-WAL model is\nproposed and utilized in conjunction with a two-channel conduction model to\nanalyze the data, revealing a surface component and evidence of multiple\nconducting channels. A facile growth method and detailed magnetotransport\nresults indicating BTS as an alternative topological insulator material system\nare presented.\n", "  The use of an infrared sensor as a new alternative to measure position as a\nfunction of time in kinematic experiments was investigated using a\nmicrocontroller as data acquisition and control device. These are versatile\nsensors that offer advantages over the typical ultrasound devices. The setup\ndescribed in this paper enables students to develop their own experiments\npromoting opportunities for learning physical concepts such as the different\ntypes of forces that can act on a body (gravitational, elastic, drag, etc.) and\nthe resulting types of movements with good sensitivity within the $\\rm 4-30~cm$\nrange. As proof of concept we also present the application of a prototype\ndesigned to record the kinematics of mass-spring systems.\n", "  For a set of equation of state (EoS) models involving interacting strange\nquark matter, characterized by an effective bag constant (B_eff) and a\nperturbative QCD corrections term (a_4), we construct fully general\nrelativistic equilibrium sequences of rapidly spinning strange stars for the\nfirst time. Computation of such sequences is important to study millisecond\npulsars and other fast spinning compact stars. Our EoS models can support a\ngravitational mass (M_G) and a spin frequency at least up to approximately 3.0\nsolar mass and approximately 1250 Hz respectively, and hence are fully\nconsistent with measured M_G and spin frequency values. This paper reports the\neffects of B_eff and a_4 on measurable compact star properties, which could be\nuseful to find possible ways to constrain these fundamental quark matter\nparameters, within the ambit of our EoS models. We confirm that a lower B_eff\nallows a higher mass. Besides, for known M_G and spin frequency, measurable\nparameters, such as stellar radius, radius-to-mass ratio and moment of inertia,\nincrease with the decrease of B_eff. Our calculations also show that a_4\nsignificantly affects the stellar rest mass and the total stellar binding\nenergy. As a result, a_4 can have signatures in evolutions of both accreting\nand non-accreting compact stars, and the observed distribution of stellar mass\nand spin and other source parameters. Finally, we compute the parameter values\nof two important pulsars, PSR J1614-2230 and PSR J1748-2446ad, which may have\nimplications to probe their evolutionary histories, and for constraining EoS\nmodels.\n", "  We report the results from a detailed $\\gamma-$ray investigation in the field\nof two \"dark accelerators\", HESS J1745-303 and HESS J1741-302, with $6.9$ years\nof data obtained by the Fermi Large Area Telescope. For HESS J1745-303, we\nfound that its MeV-GeV emission is mainly originated from the \"Region A\" of the\nTeV feature. Its $\\gamma-$ray spectrum can be modeled with a single power-law\nwith a photon index of $\\Gamma\\sim2.5$ from few hundreds MeV to TeV. Moreover,\nan elongated feature, which extends from \"Region A\" toward northwest for\n$\\sim1.3^{\\circ}$, is discovered for the first time. The orientation of this\nfeature is similar to that of a large scale atomic/molecular gas distribution.\nFor HESS J1741-302, our analysis does not yield any MeV-GeV counterpart for\nthis unidentified TeV source. On the other hand, we have detected a new point\nsource, Fermi J1740.1-3013, serendipitously. Its spectrum is apparently curved\nwhich resembles that of a $\\gamma-$ray pulsar. This makes it possibly\nassociated with PSR B1737-20 or PSR J1739-3023.\n", "  We explore the correlation of $\\gamma$-ray emitting blazars with IceCube\nneutrinos by using three very recently completed, and independently built,\ncatalogues and the latest neutrino lists. We introduce a new observable, namely\nthe number of neutrino events with at least one $\\gamma$-ray counterpart,\n$N_{\\nu}$. In all three catalogues we consistently observe a positive\nfluctuation of $N_{\\nu}$ with respect to the mean random expectation at a\nsignificance level of $0.4 - 1.3$ per cent. This applies only to extreme\nblazars, namely strong, very high energy $\\gamma$-ray sources of the high\nenergy peaked type, and implies a model-independent fraction of the current\nIceCube signal $\\sim 10 - 20$ per cent. An investigation of the hybrid photon\n-- neutrino spectral energy distributions of the most likely candidates reveals\na set of $\\approx 5$ such sources, which could be linked to the corresponding\nIceCube neutrinos. Other types of blazars, when testable, give null correlation\nresults. Although we could not perform a similar correlation study for Galactic\nsources, we have also identified two (further) strong Galactic $\\gamma$-ray\nsources as most probable counterparts of IceCube neutrinos through their hybrid\nspectral energy distributions. We have reasons to believe that our blazar\nresults are not constrained by the $\\gamma$-ray samples but by the neutrino\nstatistics, which means that the detection of more astrophysical neutrinos\ncould turn this first hint into a discovery.\n", "  The stars of the middle main sequence often have spot-like chemical\nstructures at their surfaces. We consider the diffusion process caused by\nelectric currents that can lead to the formation of such chemical spots.\nDiffusion is considered using the partial momentum equations derived by the\nChapman-Enskog method. We argue that diffusion caused by electric currents can\nsubstantially change the surface chemistry of stars and form spotted chemical\nstructures even in a relatively weak magnetic field. The considered mechanism\ncan be responsible for a formation of element spots in HgMn- and Ap-stars.\n", "  The influence of macroclumps for free-free spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of ionized winds is considered. The goal is to emphasize distinctions\nbetween microclumping and macroclumping effects. Microclumping can alter SED\nslopes and flux levels if the volume filling factor of the clumps varies with\nradius; however, the modifications are independent of the clump geometry. To\nwhat extent does macroclumping alter SED slopes and flux levels? In addressing\nthe question, two specific types of macroclump geometries are explored: shell\nfragments (\"pancake\"-shaped) and spherical clumps. Analytic and semi-analytic\nresults are derived in the limiting case that clumps never obscure one another.\nNumerical calculations based on a porosity formalism is used when clumps do\noverlap. Under the assumptions of a constant expansion, isothermal, and fixed\nionization wind, the fragment model leads to results that are essentially\nidentical to the microclumping result. Mass-loss rate determinations are not\naffected by porosity effects for shell fragments. By contrast, spherical clumps\ncan lead to a reduction in long-wavelength fluxes, but the reductions are only\nsignificant for extreme volume filling factors.\n", "  This paper presents asymptotic covariance formulae and central limit theorems\nfor geometric functionals, including volume, surface area, and all Minkowski\nfunctionals and translation invariant Minkowski tensors as prominent examples,\nof stationary Boolean models. Special focus is put on the anisotropic case. In\nthe (anisotropic) example of aligned rectangles, we provide explicit analytic\nformulae and compare them with simulation results. We discuss which information\nabout the grain distribution second moments add to the mean values.\n", "  We deal with Lagrangians which are not the standard scalar ones. We present a\nshort review of tensor Lagrangians, which generate massless free fields and the\nDirac field, as well as vector and pseudovector Lagrangians for the electric\nand magnetic fields of Maxwell's equations with sources. We introduce and\nanalyse Lagrangians which are equivalent to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and\nrecast them to relativistic equations.\n", "  Spectroscopic parameters (effective temperature, metallicity, etc) were\ndetermined for a large sample of ~100 red giants in the Kepler field, for which\nmass, radius, and evolutionary status had already been asteroseismologically\nestablished. These two kinds of spectroscopic and seismic information suffice\nto define the position on the \"luminosity versus effective temperature\" diagram\nand to assign an appropriate theoretical evolutionary track to each star.\nMaking use of this advantage, we examined whether the stellar location on this\ndiagram really matches the assigned track, which would make an interesting\nconsistency check between theory and observation. It turned out that\nsatisfactory agreement was confirmed in most cases (~90%, though appreciable\ndiscrepancies were seen for some stars such as higher-mass red-clump giants),\nsuggesting that recent stellar evolution calculations are practically reliable.\nSince the relevant stellar age could also be obtained by this comparison, we\nderived the age-metallicity relation for these Kepler giants and found the\nfollowing characteristics: (1) The resulting distribution is quite similar to\nwhat was previously concluded for FGK dwarfs. (2) The dispersion of metallicity\nprogressively increases as the age becomes older. (3) Nevertheless, the maximum\nmetallicity at any stellar age remains almost flat, which means the existence\nof super/near-solar metallicity stars in a considerably wide age range from\n~(2--3)x 10^8~yr to ~10^10~yr.\n", "  We have characterized the typical temporal behaviour of the bright X-ray\nflares detected from the three Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients showing the\nmost extreme transient behaviour (XTEJ1739-302, IGRJ17544-2619,\nSAXJ1818.6-1703). We focus here on the cumulative distributions of the\nwaiting-time (time interval between two consecutive X-ray flares), and the\nduration of the hard X-ray activity (duration of the brightest phase of an SFXT\noutburst), as observed by INTEGRAL/IBIS in the energy band 17-50 keV. Adopting\nthe cumulative distribution of waiting-times, it is possible to identify the\ntypical timescale that clearly separates different outbursts, each composed by\nseveral single flares at ks timescale. This allowed us to measure the duration\nof the brightest phase of the outbursts from these three targets, finding that\nthey show heavy-tailed cumulative distributions. We observe a correlation\nbetween the total energy emitted during SFXT outbursts and the time interval\ncovered by the outbursts (defined as the elapsed time between the first and the\nlast flare belonging to the same outburst as observed by INTEGRAL). We show\nthat temporal properties of flares and outbursts of the sources, which share\ncommon properties regardless different orbital parameters, can be interpreted\nin the model of magnetized stellar winds with fractal structure from the\nOB-supergiant stars.\n", "  A model for 3:2 high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) with 3:2\npairs observed in four black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is proposed by\ninvoking the epicyclic resonances with the magnetic connection (MC) between a\nspinning black hole (BH) with a relativistic accretion disc. It turns out that\nthe MC can be worked out due to Poynting-Robertson cosmic battery (PRCB), and\nthe 3:2 HFQPO pairs associated with the steep power-law states can be fitted in\nthis model. Furthermore, the severe damping problem in the epicyclic resonance\nmodel can be overcome by transferring energy from the BH to the inner disc via\nthe MC process for emitting X-rays with sufficient amplitude and coherence to\nproduce the HFQPOs. In addition, we discuss the important role of the magnetic\nfield in state transition of BHXBs.\n", "  Stars in star clusters are thought to form in a single burst from a common\nprogenitor cloud of molecular gas. However, massive, old globular clusters --\nwith ages greater than 10 billion years and masses of several hundred thousand\nsolar masses -- often harbour multiple stellar populations, indicating that\nmore than one star-forming event occurred during their lifetimes. Colliding\nstellar winds from late-stage, asymptotic-giant-branch stars are often invoked\nas second-generation star-formation trigger. The initial cluster masses should\nbe at least 10 times more massive than they are today for this to work.\nHowever, large populations of clusters with masses greater than a few million\nsolar masses are not found in the local Universe. Here we report on three 1-2\nbillion-year-old, massive star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, which show\nclear evidence of burst-like star formation that occurred a few hundred million\nyears after their initial formation era. We show that such clusters could\naccrete sufficient gas reservoirs to form new stars if the clusters orbited in\ntheir host galaxies' gaseous discs throughout the period between their initial\nformation and the more recent bursts of star formation. This may eventually\ngive rise to the ubiquitous multiple stellar populations in globular clusters.\n", "  The effects of local inhomogeneities on low redshift $H_0$ determinations are\nstudied by estimating the redshift-distance relation of mock sources in N-body\nsimulations. The results are compared to those obtained using the standard\napproach based on Hubble's law. The comparison shows a clear tendency for the\nstandard approach to yield lower values of $H_0$ than the approach based on the\nscheme using light rays. The difference is, however, small. More precisely, it\nis found that the overall effect of inhomogeneities on the determination of\n$H_0$ is a small increase in the local estimates of about $0.3\\%$ compared to\nthe results obtained with Hubble's law, when based on a typical distribution of\nsupernovae in the redshift range $0.01 < z < 0.1$. The overall conclusion of\nthe study is a verification of the results that have earlier been obtained by\nusing Hubble's law: The effects of inhomogeneities on local $H_0$ estimates are\nnot significant enough to make it plausible that differences in high- and\nlow-redshift estimates of $H_0$ are due to small inhomogeneities within the\nsetting of standard cosmology.\n", "  An MC@NLO-like matching of NLO QCD calculations with the Nagy-Soper parton\nshower is briefly summarised. Uncertainties and ambiguities of the matching\nscheme are shortly discussed. A few results for the pp -> ttj + X production\nprocess at the LHC with sqrt(s) = 8 TeV are also shown. All results have been\nobtained using the Nagy-Soper parton shower implementation in the DEDUCTOR\nprogram together with the HELAC-NLO framework.\n", "  Published photometry of fading events in the PTFO 8-8695 system is modelled\nusing improved treatments of stellar geometry, surface intensities, and,\nparticularly, gravity darkening, with a view to testing the planetary-transit\nhypothesis. Variability in the morphology of fading events can be reproduced by\nadopting convective-envelope gravity darkening, but near-critical stellar\nrotation is required. This leads to inconsistencies with spectroscopic\nobservations; the model also predicts substantial photometric variability\nassociated with stellar precession, contrary to observations. Furthermore, the\nempirical ratio of orbital to rotational angular momenta is at odds with\nphysically plausible values. An exoplanet transiting a precessing,\ngravity-darkened star may not be the correct explanation of periodic fading\nevents in this system.\n", "  We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of the core of IC 2497, the galaxy\nassociated with Hanny's Voorwerp and hosting a fading AGN. We find extended\nsoft X-ray emission from hot gas around the low intrinsic luminosity\n(unobscured) AGN ($L_{\\rm bol} \\sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The\ntemperature structure in the hot gas suggests the presence of a bubble or\ncavity around the fading AGN ($\\mbox{E$_{\\rm bub}$} \\sim 10^{54} - 10^{55}$\nerg). A possible scenario is that this bubble is inflated by the fading AGN,\nwhich after changing accretion state is now in a kinetic mode. Other\npossibilities are that the bubble has been inflated by the past luminous quasar\n($L_{\\rm bol} \\sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$), or that the temperature gradient is\nan indication of a shock front from a superwind driven by the AGN. We discuss\nthe possible scenarios and the implications for the AGN-host galaxy\ninteraction, as well as an analogy between AGN and X-ray binaries lifecycles.\nWe conclude that the AGN could inject mechanical energy into the host galaxy at\nthe end of its lifecycle, and thus provide a source for mechanical feedback, in\na similar way as observed for X-ray binaries.\n", "  We estimate the mass loss rates of photoevaporative winds launched from the\nouter edge of protoplanetary discs impinged by an ambient radiation field. We\nfocus on mild/moderate environments (the number of stars in the group/cluster\nis N ~ 50), and explore disc sizes ranging between 20 and 250 AU. We evaluate\nthe steady-state structures of the photoevaporative winds by coupling\ntemperature estimates obtained with a PDR code with 1D radial hydrodynamical\nequations. We also consider the impact of dust dragging and grain growth on the\nfinal mass loss rates. We find that these winds are much more significant than\nhave been appreciated hitherto when grain growth is included in the modelling:\nin particular, mass loss rates > 1e-8 M_sun/yr are predicted even for modest\nbackground field strengths ( ~ 30 G_0) in the case of discs that extend to R >\n150 AU. Grain growth significantly affects the final mass loss rates by\nreducing the average cross section at FUV wavelengths, and thus allowing a much\nmore vigorous flow. The radial profiles of observable quantities (in particular\nsurface density, temperature and velocity patterns) indicate that these winds\nhave characteristic features that are now potentially observable with ALMA. In\nparticular, such discs should have extended gaseous emission that is dust\ndepleted in the outer regions, characterised by a non-Keplerian rotation curve,\nand with a radially increasing temperature gradient.\n", "  The classical Squire transformation is extended to the entire eigenfunction\nstructure of both Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire modes. For arbitrary Reynolds\nnumbers Re, this transformation allows the solution of the initial-value\nproblem for an arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) disturbance via a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) initial-value problem at a smaller Reynolds number Re2D.\nIts implications for the transient growth of arbitrary 3D disturbances is\nstudied. Using the Squire transformation, the general solution of the\ninitial-value problem is shown to predict large-Reynolds-number scaling for the\noptimal gain at all optimization times t with t/Re finite or large. This result\nis an extension of the well-known scaling laws first obtained by Gustavsson (J.\nFluid Mech., vol. 224, 1991, pp. 241-260) and Reddy & Henningson (J. Fluid\nMech., vol. 252, 1993, pp. 209-238) for arbitrary \\alpha Re, where \\alpha is\nthe streamwise wavenumber. The Squire transformation is also extended to the\nadjoint problem and, hence, the adjoint Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire modes. It is,\nthus, demonstrated that the long-time optimal growth of 3D perturbations as\ngiven by the exponential growth (or decay) of the leading eigenmode times an\nextra gain representing its receptivity, may be decomposed as a product of the\ngains arising from purely 2D mechanisms and an analytical contribution\nrepresenting 3D growth mechanisms equal to 1+(\\beta Re/Re2D)2G, where \\beta is\nthe spanwise wavenumber and G is a known expression. For example, when the\nleading eigenmode is an Orr-Sommerfeld mode, it is given by the product of\nrespective gains from the 2D Orr mechanism and an analytical expression\nrepresenting the 3D lift-up mechanism. Whereas if the leading eigenmode is a\nSquire mode, the extra gain is shown to be solely due to the 3D lift-up\nmechanism.\n", "  It has been clarified that bulk superconductivity in\nFe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ can be induced by annealing in an appropriate\natmosphere to remove the harmful effects of excess iron. In order to clarify\nthe details of the annealing process, we studied the changes in the physical\nproperties and reaction products of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ annealed in\npnictogen (P, As, Sb) atmospheres. Crystals annealed in a pnictogen atmosphere\nshow bulk superconductivity and the values of $T_{c}$ and $J_{c}$ are about\n$14~$K and 2-4 $\\times 10{^5}~$A/cm$^2$ ($2~$K, self-field), respectively. It\nis also found that the reaction rate increases with the increase in the\nsaturated vapor pressure of the pnictogen. Unexpectedly, the reaction products\nof Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$ after annealing in a P atmosphere mainly\nconsist of FeTe$_2$. In addition, the amount of P required to obtain the\noptimal $T_{c}$ is much smaller than the amount of excess iron, which is\nsimilar to the case of oxygen annealing. P, oxygen, and to some extent As could\nserve as catalysts to form FeTe$_2$ to remove excess iron.\n", "  A central hypothesis in the theory of cataclysmic variable (CV) evolution is\nthe need to explain the observed lack of accreting systems in the ~2-3 h\norbital period range, known as the period gap. The standard model, disrupted\nmagnetic braking (DMB), reproduces the gap by postulating that CVs transform\ninto inconspicuous detached white dwarf (WD) plus main sequence (MS) systems,\nwhich no longer resemble CVs. However, observational evidence for this standard\nmodel is currently indirect and thus this scenario has attracted some criticism\nthroughout the last decades. Here we perform a simple but exceptionally strong\ntest of the existence of detached CVs (dCVs). If the theory is correct dCVs\nshould produce a peak in the orbital period distribution of detached close\nbinaries consisting of a WD and an M4-M6 secondary star. We measured six new\nperiods which brings the sample of such binaries with known periods below 10 h\nto 52 systems. An increase of systems in the ~2-3 h orbital period range is\nobserved. Comparing this result with binary population models we find that the\nobserved peak can not be reproduced by PCEBs alone and that the existence of\ndCVs is needed to reproduce the observations. Also, the WD mass distribution in\nthe gap shows evidence of two populations in this period range, i.e. PCEBs and\nmore massive dCVs, which is not observed at longer periods. We therefore\nconclude that CVs are indeed crossing the gap as detached systems, which\nprovides strong support for the DMB theory.\n", "  Quantum gravity effects modify the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to a\ngeneralized uncertainty principle (GUP). Earlier work showed that the\nGUP-induced corrections to the Schr\\\"odinger equation, when applied to a\nnon-relativistic particle in a one-dimensional box, led to the quantization of\nlength. Similarly, corrections to the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations,\ngave rise to length, area and volume quantizations. These results suggest a\nfundamental granular structure of space. In this work, it is investigated how\nspacetime curvature and gravity might influence this discreteness of space. In\nparticular, by adding a weak gravitational background field to the above three\nquantum equations, it is shown that quantization of lengths, areas and volumes\ncontinue to hold. However, it should be noted that the nature of this new\nquantization is quite complex and under proper limits, it reduces to cases\nwithout gravity. These results suggest that quantum gravity effects are\nuniversal.\n", "  IGR J16195-4945 is a hard X-ray source discovered by INTEGRAL during the Core\nProgram observations performed in 2003. We analyzed the X-ray emission of this\nsource exploiting the Swift-BAT survey data from December 2004 to March 2015,\nand all the available Swift-XRT pointed observations. The source is detected at\na high significance level in the 123-month BAT survey data, with an average\n15-150 keV flux of the source of ~1.6 mCrab. The timing analysis on the BAT\ndata reveals with a significance higher than 6 standard deviations the presence\nof a modulated signal with a period of 3.945 d, that we interpret as the\norbital period of the binary system. The folded light curve shows a flat\nprofile with a narrow full eclipse lasting ~3.5% of the orbital period. We\nrequested phase-constrained XRT observations to obtain a more detailed\ncharacterization of the eclipse in the soft X-ray range. Adopting resonable\nguess values for the mass and radius of the companion star, we derive a\nsemi-major orbital axis of ~31 R_sun, equivalent to ~1.8 times the radius of\nthe companion star. From these estimates and from the duration of the eclipse\nwe derive an orbital inclination between 55 and 60 degrees. The broad band\ntime-averaged XRT+BAT spectrum is well modeled with a strongly absorbed flat\npower law, with absorbing column N_H=7x 10^22 cm^(-2) and photon index\nGamma=0.5, modified by a high energy exponential cutoff at E_cut=14 keV.\n", "  Topological insulators are newly discovered materials with the defining\nproperty that any boundary cut into such crystal supports spectrum which is\nimmune to the Anderson localization. The present paper summarizes our efforts\non the rigorous characterization of these materials in the regime of weak and\nstrong disorder. In particular, the defining property is rigorously proven\nunder certain relevant conditions, for more than half of the classification\ntable of topological insulators.\n", "  I review few selected topics on recent theoretical progress in top physics.\nIn particular I will discuss recent progress in the computation of the\nrelationship between the MS-bar and pole top mass, in the NNLO calculation of\ntop differential distributions, and in the simulation of top production and\ndecays. Implications for top mass measurements will be discussed.\n", "  The direct bond percolation process (Gribov process) is studied in the\npresence of random velocity fluctuations generated by the Gaussian self-similar\nensemble with finite correlation time. We employ the renormalization group in\norder to analyze a combined effect of the compressibility and finite\ncorrelation time on the long-time behavior of the phase transition between an\nactive and an absorbing state. The renormalization procedure is performed to\nthe one-loop order. Stable fixed points of the renormalization group and their\nregions of stability are calculated in the one-loop approximation within the\nthree-parameter $(\\eps,y,\\eta)$-expansion. Different regimes corresponding to\nthe rapid-change limit and frozen velocity field are discussed, and their fixed\npoints' structure is determined in numerical fashion.\n", "  We investigate the qualitative evolution of (D+1)-dimensional cosmological\nmodels in f(R) gravity for the general case of the function f(R). The analysis\nis specified for various examples, including the (D+1)-dimensional\ngeneralization of the Starobinsky model, models with polynomial and exponential\nfunctions. The cosmological dynamics are compared in the Einstein and Jordan\nrepresentations of the corresponding scalar-tensor theory. The features of the\ncosmological evolution are discussed for Einstein frame potentials taking\nnegative values in certain regions of the field space.\n", "  For relativistic Weyl fermions in 3+1 dimensions, an electric current\nproportional to the external magnetic field is predicted. This remarkable\nphenomenon is called Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). Here we show that actual\ntransports in Weyl semimetals supporting CME cannot be discussed without proper\nconsideration of the law of electromagnetism. First, even in the absence of an\nexternal magnetic field, CME leads to a material-independent, universal\neffective capacitance. Moreover, the induced current by a time-dependent\nexternal magnetic field can be resonantly enhanced reflecting a formation of\nelectromagnetic standing waves.\n", "  We present the most precise value for the Higgs boson cross-section in the\ngluon-fusion production mode at the LHC. Our result is based on a perturbative\nexpansion through N$^3$LO in QCD, in an effective theory where the top-quark is\nassumed to be infinitely heavy, while all other Standard Model quarks are\nmassless. We combine this result with QCD corrections to the cross-section\nwhere all finite quark-mass effects are included exactly through NLO. In\naddition, electroweak corrections and the first corrections in the inverse mass\nof the top-quark are incorporated at three loops. We also investigate the\neffects of threshold resummation, both in the traditional QCD framework and\nfollowing a SCET approach, which resums a class of $\\pi^2$ contributions to all\norders. We assess the uncertainty of the cross-section from missing\nhigher-order corrections due to both perturbative QCD effects beyond N$^3$LO\nand unknown mixed QCD-electroweak effects. In addition, we determine the\nsensitivity of the cross-section to the choice of parton distribution function\n(PDF) sets and to the parametric uncertainty in the strong coupling constant\nand quark masses. For a Higgs mass of $m_H = 125~{\\rm GeV}$ and an LHC\ncenter-of-mass energy of $13~{\\rm TeV}$, our best prediction for the gluon\nfusion cross-section is \\[ \\sigma = 48.58\\,{\\rm pb} {}^{+2.22\\, {\\rm pb}\\,\n(+4.56\\%)}_{-3.27\\, {\\rm pb}\\, (-6.72\\%)} \\mbox{ (theory)} \\pm 1.56 \\,{\\rm\npb}\\, (3.20\\%) \\mbox{ (PDF+$\\alpha_s$)} \\]\n", "  This article is the detailed version of a paper on dark matter, dark energy,\nand modified gravity, published in the December 2015-January 2016 special issue\nof \"La Recherche\" (in French)\n", "  Equilibrium and dynamic behaviors of dechiralisation lines occurring below\nSmC* cell boundaries in planar geometry consitute a polemic topic for several\ndecades. We report new observations in the SmC* phase of the strongly polarized\nliquid crystal CFL08. They are compared with vortex motions in superfluids and\ntype-II superconductors, and we propose a simple heuristic model attempting to\nexplain the intriguing mismatch between bulk helix pitch and inter-lines\ndistance. It results from opposite effects of the helix pitch and surface lines\ncharge value on the equilibrium lines distance. The model assumes that the\nlines electric interactions dominate the cell equilibrium state. In particular\nthe unwinding transition of the bulk helix is provoked by field-induced\ndisplacements of the lines lattices. It permits to relate the lines density and\ncritical fields to intrinsic energy parameters, and to explain the\npitch-distance mismatch, together with its almost constant value across the\ntransition. We foresee the helix pitch and unwinding field variations vs.\nsample width.\n", "  Long-wave low-frequency oscillations are described in a Wigner crystal by\ngeneralization of the reverse continuum model for the case of electronic\nlattice. The internal self-consistent long-wave electromagnetic field is used\nto describe the collective motions in the system. The eigenvectors and\neigenvalues of the obtained system of equations are derived. The velocities of\nlongitudinal and transversal sound waves are found.\n", "  This article concerns new off-diagonal estimates on the remainder and its\nderivatives in the pointwise Weyl law on a compact n-dimensional Riemannian\nmanifold. As an application, we prove that near any non self-focal point, the\nscaling limit of the spectral projector of the Laplacian onto frequency windows\nof constant size is a normalized Bessel function depending only on n.\n", "  Numerical solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system of equations have important\napplications to both plasma physics and cosmology. In this paper, we present a\nnew Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method for solving this system that is 4th-order\naccurate in both space and time. Our method is a high-order extension of one\npresented previously [B. Wang, G. Miller, and P. Colella, SIAM J. Sci. Comput.,\n33 (2011), pp. 3509--3537]. It treats all of the stages of the standard PIC\nupdate - charge deposition, force interpolation, the field solve, and the\nparticle push - with 4th-order accuracy, and includes a 6th-order accurate\nphase-space remapping step for controlling particle noise. We demonstrate the\nconvergence of our method on a series of one- and two- dimensional\nelectrostatic plasma test problems, comparing its accuracy to that of a\n2nd-order method. As expected, the 4th-order method can achieve comparable\naccuracy to the 2nd-order method with many fewer resolution elements.\n", "  By means of a multi-scale first-principles approach, a description of the\nlocal electronic structure of two-dimensional and narrow phosphorene sheets\nwith various types of modifications is presented. First, a rational argument\nbased on the geometry of the pristine and modified P network, and supported by\nthe Wannier functions formalism is introduced to describe a hybridization model\nof the P atomic orbitals. {\\it Ab initio} calculations show that\nnon-isoelectronic foreign atoms form quasi-bound states at varying energy\nlevels and create different polarization states depending on the number of\nvalence electrons between P and the doping atom. The quantum transport\nproperties of modified phosphorene ribbons are further described with great\naccuracy. The distortions on the electronic bands induced by the external\nspecies lead to strong backscattering effects on the propagating charge\ncarriers. Depending on the energy of the charge-carrier and the type of doping,\nthe conduction may range from the diffusive to the localized regime.\nInterstitial defects at vacant sites lead to homogeneous transport fingerprints\nacross different types of doping atoms. We suggest that the relatively low\nvalues of charge mobility reported in experimental measurements may have their\norigin in the presence of defects.\n", "  Subwavelength-thin metasurfaces have shown great promises for the control of\noptical wavefronts, thus opening new pathways for the development of efficient\nflat optics. In particular, Huygens' metasurfaces based on all-dielectric\nresonant meta-atoms have already shown a huge potential for practical\napplications with their polarization insensitivity and high transmittance\nefficiency. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a polarization insensitive\nholographic Huygens' metasurface based on dielectric resonant meta-atoms\ncapable of complex wavefront control at telecom wavelengths. Our metasurface\nproduces a hologram image in the far-field with 82% transmittance efficiency\nand 40% imaging efficiency. Such efficient complex wavefront control shows that\nHuygens' metasurfaces based on resonant dielectric meta-atoms are a big step\ntowards practical applications of metasurfaces in wavefront design related\ntechnologies, including computer-generated holograms, ultra-thin optics,\nsecurity and data storage devices.\n", "  In order to improve the application maturity of high-order difference\nschemes, the free-stream preservation property, whose importance has been\nwidely recognized in recent years, has been developed into a focus of study..\nIn past literatures, only central schemes are considered to be suitable for\nfree-stream preservation. In this study, the methodology for arbitrary linear\nschemes to achieve the property is investigated. First, derivations of grid\nmetric by Thomas, Lombard and Neier are reviewed, through which linear schemes\nfor the metric and unsplit flux could attain the property by the proof of\nVinokur and Yee firstly. In practical applications, flux splittings are usually\nat presence and therefore the direct use of upwind schemes seems difficult to\nfulfill free-stream preservation. To overcome the difficulty, two attempts are\nmade: firstly, a central-scheme-decomposition is worked out, through which a\ncentral difference scheme is derived to approximate the first-order partial\nderivative in metric evaluations; secondly, treatments are proposed for flux\nsplitting and a concrete example is presented. Through these two attempts, the\nlinear upwind node schemes can achieve the property. For half-node or mixed\ntype schemes, interpolations should be used to derive variables at half nodes.\nAs a result, a directionally consistent interpolation is proposed, which is\nshown to be necessary in order to avoid violation of the metric identity and\nfree-stream preservation. Two numerical problems are also tested, i.e., the\nfree-stream and vortex preservation on wavy, largely randomized and triangular\ngrids. Numerical results validate aforementioned theoretical outcomes;\nespecially, simulations on the triangular grids indicate the methods discussed\nin this study, which are typical algorithms on structured grids, has the\napplication potential for problems on unstructured meshes.\n", "  A wide range of organisms features molecular machines, circadian clocks,\nwhich generate endogenous oscillations with ~24 h periodicity and thereby\nsynchronize biological processes to diurnal environmental fluctuations.\nRecently, it has become clear that plants harbor more complex gene regulatory\ncircuits within the core circadian clocks than other organisms, inspiring a\nfundamental question: are all these regulatory interactions between clock genes\nequally crucial for the establishment and maintenance of circadian rhythms? Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential\ninteractions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel\nstructure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops\ncontributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive\nthe autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as\nthe whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather\nthan activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency\nunderlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit\nsharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate\nprofiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of\ntemporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times\nof day. Our systematic approach resulting in experimentally-testable\npredictions provides insights into a design principle of biological clockwork,\nwith implications for synthetic biology.\n", "  This is a Comment on Kundhikanjana et al PRL 115 (2015) 265701 and the\nearlier Kundhikanjana et al arXiv:1306.3065v1 (2013)\n", "  We propose a scheme for the creation of robust entanglement between a movable\nmirror and atomic ensemble at the macroscopic level in coupled optomechanical\nsystem. In experimentally accessible parameter regimes, we show that critical\ntemperature of the bipartite continuous variable entanglement in our scheme can\nbe raised from previous 24 K [Vitali {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{98}, 030405 (2007)] and 20 K [Genes {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A\n\\textbf{77}, 050307(R) (2008)] to 32 K. We also investigate the entanglement\ntransfer based on this coupled system. The scheme can be used for the\nrealization of quantum memories for continuous variable quantum information\nprocessing and quantum-limited displacement measurements.\n", "  I use matrix factorizations to describe branes at simple singularities as\nthey appear in elliptic fibrations of local F-theory models. Each node of the\ncorresponding Dynkin diagrams of the ADE-type singularities is associated with\none indecomposable matrix factorization which can be deformed into one or more\nfactorizations of lower rank. Branes with internal fluxes arise naturally as\nbound states of the indecomposable factorizations. Describing branes in such a\nway avoids the need to resolve singularities and encodes information which is\nneglected in conventional F-theory treatments. This paper aims to show how\nbranes arising in local F-theory models around simple singularities can be\ndescribed in this framework.\n", "  Recently Tian, Zhang and Li (TZL) have proposed a protocol for voting based\non controlled quantum teleportation (Int. J. Theor. Phys. DOI\n10.1007/s10773-015-2868-8). We have critically analyzed the protocol and have\nshown that it's neither efficient nor secure. Further, it is shown that in the\nTZL protocol, the scrutineer Charlie does not have the required control over\nthe voting process. Apart from showing the limitations of TZL protocol, two\nimproved protocols for quantum voting along the line of TZL protocol are\nproposed here. One of the proposed protocols is designed using a standard\nscheme of controlled deterministic secure quantum communication, and the other\none is designed using the idea of quantum cryptographic switch which uses a\ntechnique known as permutation of particles (PoP). A few possible alternative\napproaches to accomplish the same task have also been discussed. Further, the\nefficiencies of the proposed protocols are reported, and it is shown that the\nproposed protocols are free from the limitations of the TZL protocol, and they\nare more efficient than the TZL protocol.\n", "  SU(3) gauge theory with eight massless fundamental fermions seems to be near\nthe conformal boundary, and is a candidate theory of walking technicolor. Along\nthe series of study by LatKMI collaboration using HISQ fermions, S-parameter\nand vector decay constant, which provide important constraints in the model of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking, are calculated for this theory. Use of various\nvolumes allows a systematic investigation of finite volume effects. A strong\nsensitivity of the S-parameter to the volume is found.\n", "  This paper establishes a Markov chain model as a unified framework for\nunderstanding information consumption processes in complex networks, with clear\nimplications to the Internet and big-data technologies. In particular, the\nproposed model is the first one to address the formation mechanism of the\n\"trichotomy\" in observed probability density functions from empirical data of\nvarious social and technical networks. Both simulation and experimental results\ndemonstrate a good match of the proposed model with real datasets, showing its\nsuperiority over the classical power-law models.\n", "  We investigate the internal dynamics of the spinor Bose-Einstein Condensates\nsubject to dissipation by solving the Lindblad master equation. It is shown\nthat for the condensates without dissipation its dynamics always evolve along\nspecific orbital in the phase space of ($n_0$, $\\theta$) and display three\nkinds of dynamical properties including Josephson-like oscillation,\nself-trapping-like oscillation and 'running phase'. In contrast, the\ncondensates subject to dissipation will not evolve along the specific dynamical\norbital. If component-1 and component-(-1) dissipate in different rates, the\nmagnetization $m$ will not conserve and the system transits between different\ndynamical regions. The dynamical properties can be exhibited in the phase space\nof ($n_0$, $\\theta$, $m$).\n", "  Studies of the inner few parsecs at the Galactic Centre provide evidence of a\nsupermassive black hole, associated with the unusual, variable radio and\ninfrared source Sgr A*.\n  Our major aim is the study and analysis of the physical processes responsible\nfor the variable emission from the compact radio source Sgr A*. In order to\nunderstand the physics behind the observed variability, we model the time\nevolution of the flare emitting region by studying light curves and spectra of\nemission originating at the surface of the accretion disk, close to the event\nhorizon, near the marginally stable orbit of a rotating black hole.\n  Here we discuss the methods used in the analysis of the time-variable\nspectral features and subsequently present preliminary modeling results.\n", "  High-Q microresonator has been suggested a promising platform for optical\nfrequency comb generation, via dissipative soliton formation. To achieve a\nhigher Q and obtain the necessary anomalous dispersion, $Si_3N_4$\nmicroresonators made of multi-mode waveguides were previously implemented.\nHowever, coupling between different transverse mode families in the multi-mode\nwaveguides results in periodic disruption of dispersion and quality factor,\nintroducing perturbation to dissipative soliton formation and amplitude\nmodulation to the corresponding spectrum. Careful choice of pump wavelength to\navoid the mode crossing region is thus critical in conventional $Si_3N_4$\nmicroresonators. Here, we report a novel design of $Si_3N_4$ microresonator\nsuch that single mode operation, high quality factor, and anomalous dispersion\nare attained simultaneously. The microresonator is consisted of uniform single\nmode waveguides in the semi-circle region, to eliminate bending induced mode\ncoupling, and adiabatically tapered waveguides in the straight region, to avoid\nexcitation of higher order modes. The intrinsic Q of the microresonator reaches\n$1.36 \\times 10^6$ while the GVD remains to be anomalous at $-50 fs^2/mm$. We\ndemonstrate, with this novel microresonator, broadband phase-locked Kerr\nfrequency combs with flat and smooth spectra can be generated by pumping at any\nresonances in the optical C-band.\n", "  Quantum Key Agreement (QKA) signifies that two or more participants together\ngenerate a key and QKA has to satisfy the following conditions: 1 Every\nparticipant can change the key and the key is not decided by any participant\nindividually. 2 Only participants can know the key; nonparticipants cannot get\nthe key through illegal means. Because of the condition 1 of participating\ntogether, it makes transport inefficient in the current mainstream protocols.\nThey use unicast to exchange messages one by one, so it will considerably limit\ntransmission efficiency and increase cost time spent. This study proposes a\nprotocol based on Multiparty Quantum Secret Direct Communication (MQSDC) with\nmulticast. In addition to satisfying the above conditions, it uses multicast to\nnot only achieve the effect and purpose of QKA, but also to defend against\ninternal and external attacks at the same time. In regard to resource\nconsumption, this study involves linear growth and is more efficient than other\nmainstream protocols which employ exponential growth.\n", "  We consider the interplanetary trajectory design problem posed by the 8th\nedition of the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition and present the\nend-to-end strategy developed by the team ACT-ISAS (a collaboration between the\nEuropean Space Agency's Advanced Concepts Team and JAXA's Institute of Space\nand Astronautical Science). The resulting interplanetary trajectory won 1st\nplace in the competition, achieving a final mission value of $J=146.33$ [Mkm].\nSeveral new algorithms were developed in this context but have an interest that\ngo beyond the particular problem considered, thus, they are discussed in some\ndetail. These include the Moon-targeting technique, allowing one to target a\nMoon encounter from a low Earth orbit; the 1-$k$ and 2-$k$ fly-by targeting\ntechniques, enabling one to design resonant fly-bys while ensuring a targeted\nfuture formation plane% is acquired at some point after the manoeuvre ; the\ndistributed low-thrust targeting technique, admitting one to control the\nspacecraft formation plane at 1,000,000 [km]; and the low-thrust optimization\ntechnique, permitting one to enforce the formation plane's orientations as path\nconstraints.\n", "  We construct not only an induced gravity model with the restricted\ndiffeomorphisms, that is, transverse diffeomorphisms which preserves the\ncurvature density, but also that with the full diffeomorphisms. By solving the\nequations of motion, it turns out that these models produce Einstein's\nequations with a certain Newton's constant in addition to the constraint for\nthe curvature density. In the limit of the infinite Newton constant, the models\ngive rise to induced gravity. Moreover, we discuss cosmological solutions on\nthe basis of the gravitational models at hand.\n", "  The Pauli Exclusion Principle (PEP) was famously discovered in 1925 by the\naustrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Since then, it underwent several\nexperimental tests. Starting in 2006, the VIP (Violation of the Pauli\nPrinciple) experiment looked for 2p to 1s X-ray transitions in copper, where 2\nelectrons are present in the 1s state before the transition happens. These\ntransitions violate the PEP, and the lack of detection of the corresponding\nX-ray photons lead to a preliminary upper limit for the violation of the PEP of\n4.7 * 10^(-29). The follow-up experiment VIP 2 is currently in the testing\nphase and will be transported to its final destination, the underground\nlaboratory of Gran Sasso in Italy, in autumn 2015. Several improvements\ncompared to its predecessor like the use of new X-ray detectors and active\nshielding from background gives rise to a goal for the improvement of the upper\nlimit of the probability for the violation of the Pauli Exclusion Principle of\n2 orders of magnitude.\n", "  Comin et al. [Science 347, 1335 (2015)] have interpreted their resonant X-ray\nscattering experiment as indicating that charge inhomogeneities in the family\nof high-temperature superconductors YBa2Cu3O6+y (YBCO) have the character of\none-dimensional stripes rather than two-dimensional checkerboards. The present\ncomment shows that one cannot distinguish between stripes and checkerboards on\nthe basis of the above experiment.\n", "  Recently, observational data and high precision mapping of the local velocity\nfield of Local Group and Virgo cluster have revealed a linear velocity-distance\nrelation of the outermost galaxies, properly referred to as Local Hubble Flow.\nBy means of direct N-body method, we performed several simulations in which a\ngalaxy cluster undergoes the action of the Dark Energy force and of the\ngravitational one induced by the gas. We reproduced the so-called Hubble\ndiagrams, to highlight the outflow of the galaxies lying in the external region\nof the cluster. Our preliminary results suggest that the observed outflow of\ngalaxies is likely due to the local effect of Dark Energy. Furthermore, the\naccuracy of the N-body method used, allows us to follow the merging process\namong some galaxies with the aim to reproduce the formation of a single compact\nobject in the centre of the cluster.\n", "  We study ns scale spin-torque-induced switching in perpendicularly magnetized\ntunnel junctions (pMTJ). Although the switching voltages match with the\nmacrospin instability threshold, the electrical signatures of the reversal\nindicate the presence of domain walls in junctions of various sizes. In the\nantiparallel (AP) to parallel (P) switching, a nucleation phase is followed by\nan irreversible flow of a wall through the sample at an average velocity of 40\nm/s with back and forth oscillation movements indicating a Walker propagation\nregime. A model with a single-wall locally responding to the spin-torque\nreproduces the essential dynamical signatures of the reversal. The P to AP\ntransition has a complex dynamics with dynamical back-hopping whose probability\nincreases with voltage. We attribute this back-hopping to the instability of\nthe nominally fixed layers.\n", "  Wetting of actual surfaces involves diverse hysteretic phenomena stemming\nfrom ever-present imperfections. Here we clarify the origin of wetting\nhysteresis for a liquid front advancing or receding across an isolated defect\nof nanometric size. Various kinds of chemical and topographical nanodefects are\ninvestigated which represent salient features of actual heterogeneous surfaces.\nThe most probable wetting path across surface heterogeneities is identified by\ncombining, within an innovative approach, microscopic classical density\nfunctional theory and the string method devised for the study of rare events.\nThe computed rugged free energy landscape demonstrates that hysteresis emerges\nas a consequence of metastable pinning of the liquid front at the defects; the\nbarriers for thermally activated defect crossing, the pinning force, and\nhysteresis are quantified and related to the geometry and chemistry of the\ndefects allowing for the occurrence of nanoscopic effects. The main result of\nour calculations is that even weak nanoscale defects, which are difficult to\ncharacterize in generic microfluidic experiments, can be the source of a\nplethora of hysteretical phenomena, including the pinning of nanobubbles.\n", "  In this work we study theoretically the properties of S-F/N-sIS type\nJosephson junctions in the frame of the quasiclassical Usadel formalism. The\nstructure consists of two superconducting electrodes (S), a tunnel barrier (I),\na combined normal metal/ferromagnet (N/F) interlayer and a thin superconducting\nfilm (s). We demonstrate the breakdown of a spatial uniformity of the\nsuperconducting order in the s-film and its decomposition into domains with a\nphase shift $\\pi $ . The effect is sensitive to the thickness of the s layer\nand the widths of the F and N films in the direction along the sIS interface.\nWe predict the existence of a regime where the structure has two energy minima\nand can be switched between them by an electric current injected laterally into\nthe structure. The state of the system can be non-destructively read by an\nelectric current flowing across the junction.\n", "  Motivated by derivation of the Dirac type delta-function for quantum states\nin Fock-Bargmann representation, we find q-binomial expansion in terms of\nq-Hermite polynomials, analytic in two complex arguments. Based on this\nrepresentation, we introduce a new class of complex functions of two complex\narguments, which we call the double q-analytic functions. The real version of\nthese functions describe the q-analogue of traveling waves, which is not\npreserving the shape during evolution as the usual traveling wave. For\ncorresponding q-wave equation we solve IVP in the q-D'Alembert form.\n", "  A typical contribution to a color ordered multi-gluon amplitude, which can\nsplit into two weakly correlated two-body gluon scattering amplitudes and may\nthus contribute to a Double Parton Interaction, is briefly discussed. We find\nthat the color ordered amplitude is not enhanced in the typical configuration\ngenerated by a DPI, where the transverse momenta of final state gluons are\ncompensated pairwise, while a dominant contribution to the multi-gluon\namplitude is due to terms proportional to the fusion amplitude of two initial\nstate gluons. Which corresponds to an amplitude effectively describing a two\nrather than a three-body partonic interaction.\n", "  We derive fractional Brownian motion and stochastic processes with\nmultifractal properties using a framework of network of Gaussian conditional\nprobabilities. This leads to the derivation of new representations of\nfractional Brownian motion. These constructions are inspired from\nrenormalization. The main result of this paper consists of constructing each\nincrement of the process from two-dimensional gaussian noise inside the\nlight-cone of each seperate increment. Not only does this allows us to derive\nfractional Brownian motion, we can introduce extensions with multifractal\nflavour. In another part of this paper, we discuss the use of the multi-scale\nentanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), introduced in the study critical\nsystems in quantum spin lattices, as a method for sampling integrals with\nrespect to such multifractal processes. After proper calibration, a MERA\npromises the generation of a sample of size $N$ of a multifractal process in\nthe order of $O(N\\log(N))$, an improvement over the known methods, such as the\nCholesky decomposition and the circulant methods, which scale between $O(N^2)$\nand $O(N^3)$.\n", "  We review a perturbative description of amplitudes in coordinate space,\naiming at an intuitive perspective on the roles of \"long\" and \"short\"\ndistances. We begin with coordinate-space leading regions for fixed-angle\nscattering amplitudes, and develop approximations and factorizations in analogy\nto similar procedures in momentum space. There are also applications to\nproducts of Wilson lines, including the familiar cusp amplitude. We briefly\ndiscuss cross sections from the coordinate viewpoint, and the mechanism by\nwhich infrared singularities cancel in inclusive cross sections.\n", "  The coalescence of a neutron-star binary is likely to result in the formation\nof a neutron-star merger remnant for a large range of binary mass\nconfigurations. The massive merger remnant shows strong oscillations, which are\nexcited by the merging process, and emits gravitational waves. Here we discuss\npossibilities and prospects of inferring unknown stellar properties of neutron\nstars by the detection of postmerger gravitational-wave emission, which thus\nleads to constraints of the equation of state of high-density matter. In\nparticular, the dominant oscillation frequency of the postmerger remnant\nprovides tight limits to neutron-star radii. We mention first steps towards a\npractical implementation of future gravitational-wave searches for the\npostmerger emission. Moreover, we outline possibilities to estimate the unknown\nmaximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars from such types of measurements.\nFinally, we review the origin and scientific implications of secondary peaks in\nthe gravitational-wave spectrum of neutron-star mergers and differences in the\ndynamical behavior of the postmerger remnant depending on the binary\nconfiguration. These considerations lead to a unified picture of the\npost-merger gravitational-wave emission and the post-merger dynamics.\n", "  Understanding the properties of electronic transport across metal-molecule\ninterfaces is of central importance for controlling a large variety of\nmolecular-based devices such as organic light emitting diodes, nanoscale\norganic spin-valves and single-molecule switches. One of the primary\nexperimental methods to reveal the mechanisms behind electronic transport\nthrough metal-molecule interfaces is the study of conductance as a function of\nmolecule length in molecular junctions. Previous studies focused on transport\ngoverned either by tunneling or hopping, both at low conductance. However, the\nupper limit of conductance across molecular junctions has not been explored,\ndespite the great potential for efficient information transfer, charge\ninjection and recombination processes. Here, we study the conductance\nproperties of highly transmitting metal-molecule-metal interfaces, using a\nseries of single-molecule junctions based on oligoacenes with increasing\nlength. We find that the conductance saturates at an upper limit where it is\nindependent of molecule length. Furthermore, we show that this upper limit can\nbe controlled by the character of the orbital hybridization at the\nmetal-molecule interface. Using two prototype systems, in which the molecules\nare contacted by either Ag or Pt electrodes, we reveal two different origins\nfor the saturation of conductance. In the case of Ag-based molecular junctions,\nthe conductance saturation is ascribed to a competition between energy level\nalignment and level broadening, while in the case of Pt-based junctions, the\nsaturation is attributed to a band-like transport. The results are explained by\nan intuitive model, backed by ab-initio transport calculations. Our findings\nshed light on the mechanisms that constrain the conductance at the high\ntransmission limit, providing guiding principles for the design of highly\nconductive metal-molecule interfaces.\n", "  The robust field-insensitive heavy fermion features in Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$\nand the magnetic phase transition at $T_N \\approx$ 5~K are studied using\nmagnetization $M(T)$, specific heat $C_p(T)$, resistivity $\\rho(T)$ and thermal\nconductivity $\\kappa_T(T)$. The average crystal structure of\nSm$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$ conforms to the cubic space group $Pm\\bar{3}n$ however,\nsignatures of subtle structural distortions are obtained from the x ray data.\nThe magnetic susceptibility, $\\chi(T)$, follows a modified Curie-Weiss law\nindicating the presence of crystal fields of Sm$^{3+}$ and the significance of\nvan Vleck terms. No sign of ferromagnetism is observed in $M(H)$ of\nSm$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$ which yields only 0.025~$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$/f.u.-Sm at 2~K,\n7~T. The Sommerfeld coefficient, $\\gamma \\approx$ 220~mJ/mol-Sm K$^2$,\nestimated from the analysis of low temperature specific heat suggests the\nformation of heavy quasi particles at low temperature. Though a ln$T$\ndependence of $\\rho(T)$ is observed till 60~K, the resistivity behavior is\naccounted for by assuming a two-band model for activated behavior of charge\ncarriers. The field scans of resistivity, $\\rho(H)$, below $T_N$ display\nsignificant nonlinearity while those above the $T_N$ are more metal-like. Low\nvalues of thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_T(T)$, are observed in\nSm$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$ however, displaying an anomaly at $T_N$ which signifies\nmagnetoelastic coupling. A fairly high value of Seebeck coefficient, $S\n\\approx$ 40~$\\mu$V/K is observed at 300~K. We identify Sm$_3$Ru$_4$Ge$_{13}$ as\na low charge carrier density system with unusual field-insensitive heavy\nfermion features very similar to the filled skutterudites.\n", "  The near-field and far-field spectral response of plasmonic systems are often\nassumed to be identical, due to the lack of methods that can directly compare\nand correlate both responses under similar environmental conditions. We develop\na widely-tuneable optical technique to probe the near-field resonances within\nindividual plasmonic nanostructures that can be directly compared to the\ncorresponding far-field response. In tightly-coupled nanoparticle-on-mirror\nconstructs with nanometer-sized gaps we find >40meV blueshifts of the\nnear-field compared to the dark-field scattering peak, which agrees with full\nelectromagnetic simulations. Using a transformation optics approach, we show\nsuch shifts arise from the different spectral interference between different\ngap modes in the near- and far-field. The control and tuning of near-field and\nfar-field responses demonstrated here is of paramount importance in the design\nof optical nanostructures for field-enhanced spectroscopy, as well as to\ncontrol near-field activity monitored through the far-field of nano-optical\ndevices.\n", "  In this article, we present a mathematical model that answers a classical\nquestion concerning how much force, which is generally called static friction\nforce, will it require to initiate the motion of a soft solid block such as\ngel, rubber or elastomer on a hard surface for instance glass surface. The\nmodel uses population balance of the bonds between the polymer chains of the\nsoft solid and the hard surface to estimate rate and aging time dependent\nstatic friction. The model predicts that under certain range of the pulling\nvelocity, the friction stress at the onset of sliding (static friction stress)\nvaries as the logarithm of the pulling velocity, as well as the logarithm of\nthe aging time. These predictions are consistent with the experimental\nobservations.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer phosphorene, a 2D system with\nquasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) excitons, provides a unique 2D platform for\ninvestigating the dynamics of excitons in reduced dimensions and fundamental\nmany-body interactions. However, on the other hand, the quasi-1D excitonic\nnature can limit the luminescence quantum yield significantly. Here, we report\nexciton brightening in monolayer phosphorene achieved via the dimensionality\nmodification of excitons from quasi-1D to zero-dimensional (0D), through the\ntransference of monolayer phosphorene samples onto defect-rich oxide substrate\ndeposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The resultant\ninterfacial luminescent local states lead to exciton localization and trigger\nefficient photon emissions at a new wavelength of ~920 nm. The luminescence\nquantum yield of 0D-like localized excitons is measured to be at least 33.6\ntimes larger than that of intrinsic quasi-1D free excitons in monolayer\nphosphorene. This is primarily due to the reduction of non-radiative decay rate\nand the possibly enhanced radiative recombination probability. Owing to the\nlarge trapping energy, this new photon emission from the localized excitons in\nmonolayer phosphorene can be observed at elevated temperature, which contrasts\nmarkedly with defect-induced photon emission from transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor monolayers that can only be observed at\ncryogenic temperatures. Our findings introduce new avenues for the development\nof novel photonic devices based on monolayer phosphorene, such as near-infrared\nlighting devices that are operable at elevated temperature. More importantly,\n2D phosphorene with quasi-1D free excitons and 0D-like localized excitons\nprovides a unique platform to investigate the fundamental phenomena in the\nideal 2D-1D-0D hybrid system.\n", "  Artificial spin ice systems, namely lattices of interacting single domain\nferromagnetic islands, have been used to date as microscopic models of\nfrustration induced by lattice topology, allowing for the direct visualization\nof spin arrangements and textures. However, the engineering of frustrated ice\nstates in which individual spins can be manipulated in situ and the real-time\nobservation of their collective dynamics remain both challenging tasks.\nInspired by recent theoretical advances, here we realize a colloidal version of\nan artificial spin ice system using interacting polarizable particles confined\nto lattices of bistable gravitational traps. We show quantitatively that\nice-selection rules emerge in this frustrated soft matter system by tuning the\nstrength of the pair interactions between the microscopic units. Via\nindependent control of particle positioning and dipolar coupling, we introduce\nmonopole-like defects and strings and use loops with defined chirality as an\nelementary unit to store binary information.\n", "  How predictable is success in complex social systems? In spite of a recent\nprofusion of prediction studies that exploit online social and information\nnetwork data, this question remains unanswered, in part because it has not been\nadequately specified. In this paper we attempt to clarify the question by\npresenting a simple stylized model of success that attributes prediction error\nto one of two generic sources: insufficiency of available data and/or models on\nthe one hand; and inherent unpredictability of complex social systems on the\nother. We then use this model to motivate an illustrative empirical study of\ninformation cascade size prediction on Twitter. Despite an unprecedented volume\nof information about users, content, and past performance, our best performing\nmodels can explain less than half of the variance in cascade sizes. In turn,\nthis result suggests that even with unlimited data predictive performance would\nbe bounded well below deterministic accuracy. Finally, we explore this\npotential bound theoretically using simulations of a diffusion process on a\nrandom scale free network similar to Twitter. We show that although higher\npredictive power is possible in theory, such performance requires a homogeneous\nsystem and perfect ex-ante knowledge of it: even a small degree of uncertainty\nin estimating product quality or slight variation in quality across products\nleads to substantially more restrictive bounds on predictability. We conclude\nthat realistic bounds on predictive accuracy are not dissimilar from those we\nhave obtained empirically, and that such bounds for other complex social\nsystems for which data is more difficult to obtain are likely even lower.\n", "  Pseudospin plays a very important role in understanding various interesting\nphysical phenomena associated with 2D materials such as graphene. It has been\nproposed that pseudospin is directly related to angular momentum, and it was\nrecently experimentally demonstrated that orbit angular momentum is an\nintrinsic property of pseudospin in a photonic honeycomb lattice. However, in\nphotonics, the interaction between spin and pseudospin for light has never been\ninvestigated. In this Letter, we propose that, in an optical analogue of\nstaggered graphene, i.e. a photonic honeycomb lattice waveguide with in-plane\ninversion symmetry breaking, the pseudospin mode can strongly couple to the\nspin of an optical beam incident along certain directions. The spin-pseudospin\ncoupling, caused by the spin-orbit conversion in the scattering process,\ninduces a strong optical chiral effect for the transmitted optical beam.\nSpin-pseudospin coupling of light opens door to the design of\npseudospin-mediated spin or valley selective photonic devices.\n", "  Many social networks and complex systems are found to be naturally divided\ninto clusters of densely connected nodes, known as community structure (CS).\nFinding CS is one of fundamental yet challenging topics in network science. One\nof the most popular classes of methods for this problem is to maximize Newman's\nmodularity. However, there is a little understood on how well we can\napproximate the maximum modularity as well as the implications of finding\ncommunity structure with provable guarantees. In this paper, we settle\ndefinitely the approximability of modularity clustering, proving that\napproximating the problem within any (multiplicative) positive factor is\nintractable, unless P = NP. Yet we propose the first additive approximation\nalgorithm for modularity clustering with a constant factor. Moreover, we\nprovide a rigorous proof that a CS with modularity arbitrary close to maximum\nmodularity QOPT might bear no similarity to the optimal CS of maximum\nmodularity. Thus even when CS with near-optimal modularity are found, other\nverification methods are needed to confirm the significance of the structure.\n", "  We review two rigorous results on the transport properties of weakly\ninteracting fermionic systems on $2d$ lattices, in the linear response regime.\nFirst, we discuss the universality of the longitudinal conductivity for\ninteracting graphene. Then, we focus on the transverse conductivity of general\nweakly interacting gapped fermionic systems, and we establish its universality.\nThis last result proves the stability of the integer quantum Hall effect\nagainst weak interactions. The proofs are based on combinations of fermionic\ncluster expansion techniques, renormalization group and lattice Ward\nidentities.\n", "  We study the evolution of time-like congruences in the vacuum solutions of\nWeyl conformal theory of gravity. Using the Raycaudhuri equation, we show that\nfor positive values of the coeffcient of the linear term in the solution and in\nthe absence of the cosmological constant, the incoming rays converge. The\nevolution of the congruence for negative values is investigated for different\nvalues of the parameters. The behavior of the congruence under conformal\ntransformations is also studied.\n", "  The simplest molecules in nature, molecular hydrogen ions in the form of H2+\nand HD+, provide an important benchmark system for tests of quantum\nelectrodynamics in complex forms of matter. Here, we report on such a test\nbased on a frequency measurement of a vibrational overtone transition in HD+ by\nlaser spectroscopy. We find that the theoretical and experimental frequencies\nare equal to within 0.6(1.1) parts per billion, which represents the most\nstringent test of molecular theory so far. Our measurement not only confirms\nthe validity of high-order quantum electrodynamics in molecules, but also\nenables the long predicted determination of the proton-to-electron mass ratio\nfrom a molecular system, as well as improved constraints on hypothetical fifth\nforces and compactified higher dimensions at the molecular scale. With the\nperspective of comparisons between theory and experiment at the 0.01\npart-per-billion level, our work demonstrates the potential of molecular\nhydrogen ions as a probe of fundamental physical constants and laws.\n", "  These notes merely intend to memorialize Souriau's overlooked achievements\nregarding geo\\-metric quantization of Poincar\\'e-elementary symplectic systems.\nRestricting attention to his model of massless, spin-$\\half$, particles, we\nfaithfully rephrase and expound here Sections (18.82)--(18.96) &\n(19.122)--(19.134) of his book \\cite{SSD} edited in 1969. Missing details about\nthe use of a preferred Poincar\\'e-invariant polarizer are provided for\ncompleteness.\n", "  We check the existence of a spontaneous magnetisation of Ising and Potts\nspins on semi-directed Barabasi-Albert networks by Monte Carlo simulations. We\nverified that the magnetisation for different temperatures $T$ decays after a\ncharacteristic time $\\tau(T)$, which we extrapolate to diverge at positive\ntemperatures $T_c(N)$ by a Vogel-Fulcher law, with $T_c(N)$ increasing\nlogarithmically with network size $N$.\n", "  Spin defects in wide-band gap semiconductors are promising systems for the\nrealization of quantum bits, or qubits, in solid-state environments. To date,\ndefect qubits have only been realized in materials with strong covalent bonds.\nHere, we introduce a strain-driven scheme to rationally design defect spins in\nfunctional ionic crystals, which may operate as potential qubits. In\nparticular, using a combination of state-of-the-art ab-initio calculations\nbased on hybrid density functional and many-body perturbation theory, we\npredicted that the negatively charged nitrogen vacancy center in piezoelectric\naluminum nitride exhibits spin-triplet ground states under realistic uni- and\nbi-axial strain conditions; such states may be harnessed for the realization of\nqubits. The strain-driven strategy adopted here can be readily extended to a\nwide range of point defects in other wide-band gap semiconductors, paving the\nway to controlling the spin properties of defects in ionic systems for\npotential spintronic technologies.\n", "  We discuss a generalization of the Ehrenfest theorem to the recently proposed\nprecanonical quantization of vielbein gravity which proceeds from a space-time\nsymmetric generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism to field theory.\nClassical Einstein-Palatini equations are derived as equations of expectation\nvalues of precanonical quantum operators. The preceding consideration of an\ninteracting scalar field theory on curved space-time shows how the classical\nfield equations emerge from the results of precanonical quantization as the\nequations of expectation values of the corresponding quantum operators. It also\nallows us to identify the connection term in the covariant generalization of\nthe precanonical Schr\u007f\\\"odinger equation with the spin connection.\n", "  Cascades of information-sharing are a primary mechanism by which content\nreaches its audience on social media, and an active line of research has\nstudied how such cascades, which form as content is reshared from person to\nperson, develop and subside. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis\nof cascades on Facebook over significantly longer time scales, and find that a\nmore complex picture emerges, in which many large cascades recur, exhibiting\nmultiple bursts of popularity with periods of quiescence in between. We\ncharacterize recurrence by measuring the time elapsed between bursts, their\noverlap and proximity in the social network, and the diversity in the\ndemographics of individuals participating in each peak. We discover that\ncontent virality, as revealed by its initial popularity, is a main driver of\nrecurrence, with the availability of multiple copies of that content helping to\nspark new bursts. Still, beyond a certain popularity of content, the rate of\nrecurrence drops as cascades start exhausting the population of interested\nindividuals. We reproduce these observed patterns in a simple model of content\nrecurrence simulated on a real social network. Using only characteristics of a\ncascade's initial burst, we demonstrate strong performance in predicting\nwhether it will recur in the future.\n", "  We detect the persistence of the solidification and order-disorder\nfirst-order transition lines in the phase diagram of nanocrystalline\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ vortex matter down to a system size of less\nthan hundred vortices. The temperature-location of the vortex solidification\ntransition line is not altered by decreasing the sample size although there is\na depletion of the entropy-jump at the transition with respect to macroscopic\nvortex matter. The solid order-disorder phase transition field moves upward on\ndecreasing the system size due to the increase of the surface-to-volume ratio\nof vortices entailing a decrease on the average vortex binding energy.\n", "  We examined the tunability of the capacitance for GaFeO3-ionic liquid-GaFeO3\ncomposite material by external magnetic and electric field. Up to 1.6 folds of\ncapacitance tunability could be achieved at 957kHz with voltage 4v and magnetic\nfield 0.02T applied. We show that the capacitance enhancement is due to the\npolarization coupling between dielectric layer and ionic liquid layer.\n", "  We propose that charge gradient resulting in the coexisting\nmagneto-resistance and-capacitance tunability in material systems. We have\nexperimentally observed coexisting of tunable magneto-resistance and\n-capacitance in Sm2Ga2Fe2O9. Our model fits well with the experimental result.\n", "  We present the first large-scale, full radiative transfer simulations of the\nreionization of the intergalactic medium in the presence of Lyman-limit systems\n(LLSs). To illustrate the impact of LLS opacity, possibly missed by previous\nsimulations, we add either a uniform or spatially-varying hydrogen bound-free\nopacity. This opacity, implemented as the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing\nphotons, extrapolates the observed, post-reionization redshift dependence into\nthe epoch of reionization. In qualitative agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that at late times the presence of LLSs slows down the ionization fronts,\nand alters the size distribution of H II regions. We quantitatively\ncharacterize the size distribution and morphological evolution of H II regions\nand examine the effects of the LLSs on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the\npatchy reionization. The presence of LLSs extends the ionization history by\n$\\Delta z \\sim 0.8$. The LLS absorbers significantly impede the late-time\ngrowth of the H II regions. The position dependent LLS distribution slows\nreionization further and additionally limits the late growth of the ionized\nregions. However, there is no \"freeze out\" of the H II regions and the largest\nregions grow to the size of the simulation volume. The 21-cm power spectra show\nthat at large scales the power drops by a factor of 2 for 50% and 75%\nionization stages (at $k = 0.1$ $\\text{h} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1} $) reflecting the\nlimiting effect of the LLSs on the growth of ionized patches. The statistical\nobservables such as the RMS of the brightness temperature fluctuations and the\npeak amplitudes of the 21-cm power spectra at large-scales ($k = 0.05 - 0.1$\n$\\text{h} \\, \\text{Mpc}^{-1} $) are diminished by the presence of LLS.\n", "  High-entropy alloys are an intriguing new class of metallic materials that\nderive their properties from being multi-element systems that can crystallize\nas a single phase, despite containing high concentrations of five or more\nelements with different crystal structures. Here we examine an equiatomic\nmedium-entropy alloy containing only three elements, CrCoNi, as a single-phase\nface-centered cubic (fcc) solid solution, which displays strength-toughness\nproperties that exceed those of all high-entropy alloys and most multi-phase\nalloys. At room temperature the alloy shows tensile strengths of almost 1 GPa,\nfailure strains of ~70%, and KJIc fracture-toughness values above 200 MPa.m1/2;\nat cryogenic temperatures strength, ductility and toughness of the CrCoNi alloy\nimprove to strength levels above 1.3 GPa, failure strains up to 90% and KJIc\nvalues of 275 MPa.m1/2. Such properties appear to result from continuous steady\nstrain hardening, which acts to suppress plastic instability, resulting from\npronounced dislocation activity and deformation-induced nano-twinning.\n", "  The BRAHMS collaboration has measured transverse momentum spectra of pions,\nkaons, protons and antiprotons at rapidities 0 and 3 for Cu+Cu collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. As the collisions become more central the collective\nradial flow increases while the temperature of kinetic freeze-out decreases.\nThe temperature is lower and the radial flow weaker at forward rapidity. Pion\nand kaon yields with transverse momenta between 1.5 and 2.5 GeV/c are\nsuppressed for central collisions relative to scaled $p+p$ collisions. This\nsuppression, which increases as the collisions become more central is\nconsistent with jet quenching models and is also present with comparable\nmagnitude at forward rapidity. At such rapidities initial state effects may\nalso be present and persistence of the meson suppression to high rapidity may\nreflect a combination of jet quenching and nuclear shadowing. The ratio of\nprotons to mesons increases as the collisions become more central and is\nlargest at forward rapidities.\n", "  Selective laser sintering (SLS) of single component metal powders is a rapid\nprototyping technology in which a high-energy laser beam scans, melts, shrinks\nand consolidates metal powders with single component. For better understanding\nphysical mechanisms during laser sintering of single-component metal particles,\na temperature transforming model with the consideration of shrinkage and\nconvective flows is introduced to analyze the thermal/fluid behaviors in\nselective laser sintering of single powder layer. The model is also applied to\ninvestigate the sintering of powders on top of existing sintered layers under\nsingle- multiple-line scanning manners according to the practical manufacturing\nprocesses.\n", "  A thermal model of chemical vapor deposition of titanium nitride (TiN) on the\nspherical particle surface under irradiation by a nanosecond laser pulse is\npresented in this paper. Heat and mass transfer on a single spherical metal\npowder particle surface subjected to temporal Gaussian heat flux is\ninvestigated analytically. The chemical reaction on the particle surface and\nthe mass transfer in the gas phase are also considered. The surface\ntemperature, thermal penetration depth, and deposited film thickness under\ndifferent laser fluence, pulse width, initial particle temperature, and\nparticle radius are investigated. The effect of total pressure in the reaction\nchamber on deposition rate is studied as well. The particle-level model\npresented in this paper is an important step toward development of multiscale\nmodel of LCVI.\n", "  Modeling of crowds of pedestrians has been considered in this paper from\ndifferent aspects. Based on fractional microscopic model that may be much more\nclose to reality, a fractional macroscopic model has been proposed using\nconservation law of mass. Then in order to characterize the competitive and\ncooperative interactions among pedestrians, fractional mean field games are\nutilized in the modeling problem when the number of pedestrians goes to\ninfinity and fractional dynamic model composed of fractional backward and\nfractional forward equations are constructed in macro scale. Fractional\nmicro-macro model for crowds of pedestrians are obtained in the end. Simulation\nresults are also included to illustrate the proposed fractional microscopic\nmodel and fractional macroscopic model respectively.\n", "  For the original hybrid inflation model, we calculate the power spectrum of\ncurvature perturbations generated during the waterfall, taking into account the\ncontribution of entropic modes. We study the regime where the potential is very\nflat, and in which inflation continues for more than about 60 e-folds. Results\nshow oscillations in the scalar power spectrum, qualitatively similar to that\nof a single field axion monodromy potential; however no feature is displayed in\nthe tensor power spectrum. Directions to develop a template for this power\nspectrum are also discussed.\n", "  The pretransitional behavior of dodecylcyanobiphenyl (12CB)\n(isotropic-smectic-A-solid mesomorphism) with $d = 50$ nm $BaTiO_3$\nnanoparticles (NPs) linked the cubic phase was monitored via temperature\nstudies of dielectric constant. Tests were carried out in the isotropic, liquid\ncrystal mesomorphic and solid phases. For each phase transition the same value\nof the critical exponent $\\alpha=0.5$ was obtained, including nanocolloids. All\nphase transitions show the weakly discontinuous nature. The temperature metric\nof the discontinuity dT notably decreases when adding nanoparticles. The\naddition of nanoparticles first decreases the dielectric constant by approx.\n$50%$ in comparison with pure 12CB, but already for a concentration $x = 0.4%%\nNPs an increase over $50%$ takes place. It is notable that for the latter\nconcentration unique hallmarks of the pretransitional effect emerge also for\nthe solid-mesophase transition. All thease indicate the important impact of\nnanoparticles on multimolecular mesoscale fluctuations.\n", "  We study the coexistence of the quantum Zeno effect and non-Markovianity for\na system decaying in a structured bosonic environment and subject to a control\nfield. The interaction with the environment induces decay from the excited to\nthe ground level, which, in turn, is coherently coupled to another meta-stable\nstate. The control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable\nlevels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory\neffects, without modifying neither the system-reservoir interaction, nor\nenvironmental properties. We use this framework in two different parameter\nregimes corresponding to fast (bad cavity limit) and slow dissipation (good\ncavity limit) in the original, un-controlled qubit system. Our results show a\nnon-monotonic behavior of memory effects when increasing the effectiveness of\nthe Zeno-like freezing. Moreover, we identify a new source of memory effects\nwhich allows the persistence of non-Markovianity for long times while the\nexcited state has already been depleted.\n", "  The topological theory of phase transitions has its strong point in two\ntheorems proving that, for a wide class of physical systems, phase transitions\nnecessarily stem from topological changes of some submanifolds of configuration\nspace. It has been recently argued that the $2D$ lattice $\\phi^4$-model\nprovides a counterexample that falsifies this theory. It is here shown that\nthis is not the case: the phase transition of this model stems from an\nasymptotic ($N\\to\\infty$) change of topology of the energy level sets, in spite\nof the absence of critical points of the potential in correspondence of the\ntransition energy.\n", "  The Artmann formula provides an accurate determination of the Goos-Haenchen\nlateral displacement in terms of the light wavelength, refractive index and\nincidence angle. In the total reflection region, this formula is widely used in\nthe literature and confirmed by experiments. Nevertheless, for incidence at\ncritical angle, it tends to infinity and numerical calculations are needed to\nreproduce the experimental data. In this paper, we overcome the divergence\nproblem at critical angle and find, for Gaussian beams, a closed formula in\nterms of modified Bessel functions of the first kind. The formula is in\nexcellent agreement with numerical calculations and reproduces, for incidence\nangles greater than critical ones, the Artmann formula. The closed form also\nallows one to understand how the breaking of symmetry in the angular\ndistribution is responsible for the difference between measurements done by\nconsidering the maximum and the mean value of the beam intensity. The results\nobtained in this study clearly show the Goos-Haenchen lateral displacement\ndependence on the angular distribution shape of the incoming beam. Finally, we\nalso present a brief comparison with experimental data and other analytical\nformulas found in the literature.\n", "  Explicit expressions are derived for the matrices determining the mean\ntranslational and rotational swimming velocities and the mean rate of\ndissipation for Stokesian swimming at low Reynolds number of a distorting\nsphere in a viscous incompressible fluid. As an application an efficient\nhelical propeller-type stroke is found and its properties are calculated.\n", "  A set of idealized experiments are performed to analyze the competing effects\nof declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations, the opening of an ocean gateway,\nand varying orbital parameters. These forcing mechanisms, which influence the\nglobal mean climate state, may have played a role for triggering climate\ntransitions of the past (for example during the Eocene-Oligocene climate\ntransition and the build-up of the Antarctic Ice Sheet). Sensitivity\nsimulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model are\nconducted to test these three forcings and their roles for the global climate.\nThe simulations are carried out under idealized conditions to focus on the\nessentials. The combination of all three forcings triggers a climate transition\nwhich resembles the onset of the Antarctic glaciation. In particular, the\ntemperatures in the southern high latitudes decrease and snow accumulates\nconstantly. Moreover, the relative importance of each possible forcing is\nexplored. All three of the mechanisms (atmospheric CO2 decrease, opening of the\nocean gateways, and changing orbital parameters) cool the climate of the\nsouthern polar continent. The change induced by the orbital parameters depends\nstrongly on the magnitude of the change in obliquity.\n", "  Majorana modes and fractional fermions are two types of edge zero modes\nappearing separately in topological superconductors and dimerized chains. Here\nwe reveal how to harvest both types of edge modes simultaneously in an exotic\nchain. Such modes are naturally spin-charge separated, and are protected by the\ninversion and spin-parity symmetries. We construct a lattice model to\nillustrate the nature of these edge modes, utilizing fermionic functional\nrenormalization group, mean-field theory and bosonization. We also elucidate\nthat the four-fold degenerate ground states with edge-spinons in the Haldane\nphase of spin-$1$ chain may be reinterpreted as our spin-charge separated edge\nmodes in an equivalent spin-$1/2$ fermionic model.\n", "  Ribbons are long narrow strips possessing three distinct material length\nscales (thickness, width, and length) which allow them to produce unique shapes\nunobtainable by wires or filaments. For example when a ribbon has half a twist\nand is bent into a circle it produces a M\\\"obius strip. Significant effort has\ngone into determining the structural shapes of ribbons but less is know about\ntheir behavior in viscous fluids. In this paper we determine, asymptotically,\nthe leading-order hydrodynamic behavior of a slender ribbon in Stokes flows.\nThe derivation, reminiscent of slender-body theory for filaments, assumes that\nthe length of the ribbon is much larger than its width, which itself is much\nlarger than its thickness. The final result is an integral equation for the\nforce density on a mathematical ruled surface, termed the ribbon plane, located\ninside the ribbon. A numerical implementation of our derivation shows good\nagreement with the known hydrodynamics of long flat ellipsoids, and\nsuccessfully captures the swimming behavior of artificial microscopic swimmers\nrecently explored experimentally. We also study the asymptotic behavior of a\nribbon bent into a helix, that of a twisted ellipsoid, and we investigate how\naccurately the hydrodynamics of a ribbon can be effectively captured by that of\na slender filament. Our asymptotic results provide the fundamental framework\nnecessary to predict the behavior of slender ribbons at low Reynolds numbers in\na variety of biological and engineering problems.\n", "  We report a concept of thermoelectric devices, cooperative spin caloritronics\ndevice (CSCD), where cooperation between two or more energy channels such as\nspin, charge and heat currents can significantly enhance energy efficiency of\nspin caloritronic devices. We derive the figure of merit and the maximum\nefficiency due to cooperative effect in analytic forms for a CSCD. Cooperative\neffects significantly improve the figure of merit and the maximum efficiency in\nspin caloritronic systems with multiply couplings effects. Several examples of\nCSCDs, including electrical and thermal current induced DW motion,\nspin-thermoelectric power generator and spin-thermoelectric cooling/heating,\nare studied to illustrate the usefulness of the cooperative effect. We compare\nthe efficiency of CSCD with several recently proposed spin caloritronic\ndevices. Our scheme provides a novel route to seek high performance materials\nand structures for future spin caloritronic devices.\n", "  We obtain a scaling relation for spherically symmetric k-essence scalar\nfields $\\phi(r,t)$ for an inhomogeneous cosmology with the Lemaitre-Tolman-\nBondi (LTB) metric. We show that this scaling relation reduces to the known\nrelation for a homogeneous cosmology when the LTB metric reduces to the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric under certain identifications\nof the metric functions. A k-essence lagrangian is set up and the\nEuler-Lagrangian equations solved assuming $\\phi(r,t)=\\phi_{1}(r) +\n\\phi_{2}(t)$. The solutions enable the LBT metric functions to be related to\nthe fields. The LTB inhomogeneous universe exhibits late time accelerated\nexpansion i.e.cosmic acceleration driven by negative pressure.\n", "  We analyze spherical and odd-parity linear perturbations of hairy black holes\nwith a minimally coupled scalar field.\n", "  Majorana fermions are currently of huge interest in the context of\nnanoscience and condensed matter physics. Different to usual fermions, Majorana\nfermions have the property that the particle is its own anti-particle thus,\nthey must be described by real fields. Mathematically, this property makes\nnontrivial the quantization of the problem due, for instance, to the absence of\na Wick-like theorem. In view of the present interest on the subject, it is\nimportant to develop different theoretical approaches in order to study\nproblems where Majorana fermions are involved. In this note we show that\nMajorana fermions can be studied in the context of field theories for\nconstrained systems. Using the Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for quantum field\ntheories with constraints, we derived the path integral representation for\nMajorana fermions. In order to show the validity of the path integral we apply\nit to an exactly solvable problem. This application also shows that it is\nrather simple to perform systematic calculations on the basis of the present\nframework.\n", "  This paper presents a numerical approximation technique for the Boltzmann\nequation based on a moment system approximation in velocity dependence and a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin finite-element approximation in position dependence. The\nclosure relation for the moment systems derives from minimization of a suitable\n{\\phi}-divergence. This divergence-based closure yields a hierarchy of\ntractable symmetric hyperbolic moment systems that retain the fundamental\nstructural properties of the Boltzmann equation. The resulting combined\ndiscontinuous Galerkin moment method corresponds to a Galerkin approximation of\nthe Boltzmann equation in renormalized form. We present a new class of\nnumerical flux functions, based on the underlying renormalized Boltzmann\nequation, that ensure entropy dissipation of the approximation scheme.\nNumerical results are presented for a one-dimensional test case.\n", "  A three-dimensional numerical model for an accretion process investigation in\nthe magnetosphere of a white dwarf in magnetic cataclysmic variables is\ndeveloped. The model assumes that the white dwarf has a dipole magnetic field\nwith its symmetry axis inclined to the rotation axis. The model is based on the\nequations of modified MHD, that describe the mean flow parameters in the wave\nMHD turbulence. Diffusion of the magnetic field and radiative heating and\ncooling are taken into account. The suitability of the model is confirmed by\nmodeling the accretion in a typical intermediate polar. The computations show\nthat a magnetosphere forms around the accretor, with the accretion occurring\nvia columns. The accretion columns have a curtain-like shape, and arc-shaped\nzones of energy release form on the surface of the white dwarf in the magnetic\npoles area as a result of the matter infall.\n", "  The substitution of gallium by aluminum, germanium, tin and indium in\nPuCoGa5, the actinide-based superconductor with the highest critical\ntemperature, has been investigated. Only systems with 20% substitution by Al\nand Ge (i.e. PuCoGa4Al and PuCoGa4Ge) have been successfully synthesized by\nannealing arc-melted samples. X-ray powder diffraction refinements indicate an\nenhanced c/a ratio in these two compounds but the magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements reveal a large reduction of the critical temperature Tc compared\nto PuCoGa5. DFT+ED calculations indicate significant changes in the Fermi\nsurface, probably related to the decrease of Tc, in these compounds. In\naddition, the isotopic effect of the atomic mass of gallium, using 69Ga and\n71Ga isotopes, was also investigated without observable influence on the\ncritical temperature of PuCoGa5.\n", "  We study the thermodynamics of the asymptotically flat static black hole in\nLovelock back ground where the coupling constants of the Lovelock theory\neffects are taken into account. We consider the effects of the second order of\nthe coupling constant, and third order of the Lovelock constant coefficient on\nthe thermodynamics of asymptotically flat static black holes. In this case the\neffect of the coupling constants on the thermodynamics of the black hole are\ndiscussed for 5, 6, and 7 dimensional spacetime.\n", "  The dipolar (magnetostatic) interaction dominates the behavior of spin waves\nin magnetic films in the long-wavelength regime. In an in-plane magnetized\nfilm, volume modes exist with a negative group velocity (backward volume\nmagnetostatic spin waves), in addition to the forward surface-localized mode\n(Damon-Eshbach). Inside the film of finite thickness $L$, the volume modes have\na nontrivial spatial dependence, and their two-dimensional dispersion relations\n$\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$ can be calculated only numerically. We present explicit\nperturbative expressions for the profiles and frequencies of the volume modes,\ntaking into account an in-plane applied field and uniaxial anisotropy, for the\nregimes $\\lVert \\mathbf{k}L \\rVert \\gg 1$ and $\\lVert \\mathbf{k}L \\rVert \\ll\n1$, which together provide a good indication of the behavior of the modes for\narbitrary wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. Moreover, we derive a very accurate\nsemianalytical expression for the dispersion relation $\\omega(\\mathbf{k})$ of\nthe lowest-frequency mode that is straightforward to evaluate using standard\nnumerical routines. Our results are useful to quickly interpret and control the\nexcitation and propagation of spin waves in (opto-)magnetic experiments.\n", "  We consider a system where structural polymorphism suggests the possible\nexistence of superconductivity through the implied structural instability.\nSrPd2Bi2 has two poly-morphs which can be controlled by the synthesis\ntemperature: a tetragonal form (CaBe2Ge2-type) and a monoclinic form\n(BaAu2Sb2-type). Though the crystallographic difference between the two forms\nmay at first seem trivial, we show that tetragonal SrPd2Bi2 is superconducting\nat 2.0 K whereas monoclinic SrPd2Bi2 is not. We rationalize this finding and\nplace it in context with other 1-2-2 phases\n", "  We study the \\emph{orbital effects} of the synthetic magnetic fields in an\ninteracting square lattice two-leg fermionic ladder model with the\nnumber-conserving pair hopping that hosting the Majorana bound states. By\nutilizing density matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization, we\nidentify a novel type-II topological Meissner $($\\emph{topo}-Meissner$)$ phase\n$($as distinguished from the low-field type-I \\emph{topo}-Meissner state$)$\nwhen threading a \\emph{high} magnetic flux through the plaquette of the ladder,\nwhich not only exhibits a large uniformly circulating chiral current along the\nlegs, the characteristics of the celebrated Meissner state, but also\naccommodates a topologically protected ground-state manifold due to the\n\\emph{reentrant} emergence of the Majorana end modes. Our work reveals some\ninteresting interference effects resulting from the interplay between the gauge\nfields and the strong interactions in establishing the intrinsic topological\nstates of matter in low-dimensional quantum systems.\n", "  The rare decays of a kaon into a pion and a charged lepton/antilepton pair\nproceed via a flavour changing neutral current and therefore may only be\ninduced beyond tree level in the Standard Model. This natural suppression makes\nthese decays sensitive to the effects of potential New Physics. To discern such\nNew Physics one must be able to control the errors on the Standard Model\nprediction of the decay amplitude. These particular decay channels however are\ndominated by a single photon exchange; this involves a sizeable long-distance\nhadronic contribution which represents the current major source of theoretical\nuncertainty. Here we outline our methodology for the computation of the long\ndistance contributions to these rare decay amplitudes using lattice QCD, and\npresent the numerical results of some exploratory studies using the Domain Wall\nFermion ensembles of the RBC and UKQCD collaborations.\n", "  We show that the hemisphere partition function for certain U(1) gauged linear\nsigma models (GLSMs) with D-branes is related to a particular set of\nMellin-Barnes integrals which can be used for analytic continuation to the\nsingular point in the K\\\"ahler moduli space of an $h^{1,1}=1$ Calabi-Yau (CY)\nprojective hypersurface. We directly compute the analytic continuation of the\nfull quantum corrected central charge of a basis of geometric D-branes from the\nlarge volume to the singular point. In the mirror language this amounts to\ncompute the analytic continuation of a basis of periods on the mirror CY to the\nconifold point. However, all calculations are done in the GLSM and we do not\nhave to refer to the mirror CY. We apply our methods explicitly to the cubic,\nquartic and quintic CY hypersurfaces.\n", "  We perform the analytic continuation of solutions to the hypergeometric\ndifferential equation of order $n$ to the third regular singularity, usually\ndenoted $z=1$, with the help of recurrences of their Mellin--Barnes integral\nrepresentations. In the resonant case, there are necessarily logarithmic\nsolutions. We apply the result to Picard-Fuchs equations of certain\none--parameter families of Calabi--Yau manifolds, known as the mirror quartic\nand the mirror quintic.\n", "  We investigate the validity of the Cosmological Principle by constraining the\ncosmological parameters $H_0$ and $q_0$ through the celestial sphere. Our\nanalyses are performed in a low-redshift regime in order to follow a model\nindependent approach, using both Union2.1 and JLA Type Ia Supernovae (SNe)\ncompilations. We find that the preferred direction of the $H_0$ parameter in\nthe sky is consistent with the bulk flow motion of our local Universe in the\nUnion2.1 case, while the $q_0$ directional analysis seem to be anti-correlated\nwith the $H_0$ for both data sets. Furthermore, we test the consistency of\nthese results with Monte Carlo (MC) realisations, finding that the anisotropy\non both parameters are significant within $2-3\\sigma$ confidence level, albeit\nwe find a significant correlation between the $H_0$ and $q_0$ mapping with the\nangular distribution of SNe from the JLA compilation. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the detected anisotropies are either of local origin, or induced by the\nnon-uniform celestial coverage of the SNe data set.\n", "  Investigations have shown that the collective motion not only appears in\nnucleus-nucleus but also in p-p collisions. The best tool for depicting such\ncollective motion is relativistic hydrodynamics. In this paper, the collective\nmotion is assumed obeying the hydro model which integrates the features of\nLandau and Hwa-Bjorken theory and is one of a very few analytically solvable\nmodels. The fluid is then supposed freezing out into charged particles from a\ntime-like hypersurface with a fixed time of t_FO . The researches of present\npaper show that this part of charged particles together with leading particles,\nwhich, by conventional definition, carry on the quantum numbers of colliding\nnucleons and take away the most part of incident energy, can give a proper\nuniversal description to the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles\nmeasured in both nucleus-nucleus and p-p collisions at now available energy\nregions.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to resolve a question regarding efficiency of a\nlightning protection system (LPS) for buildings based on the collection volume\nmethod (CVM) . The paper has two components. The first, following suggestions\nof other authors [Abidin and Ibrahim 2004], takes advantage of count data from\ninstalled devices, and independent installation-site inspections to develop our\nstatistical analysis. The second component investigates the validity of the\nunderlying theory by introducing a novel methodology of fractional Poisson\nprocesses, which are able to reproduce the burstiness of lightning strikes, an\nessential feature of stochastic time dependence of incidence of lightning\nstrikes. The standard Poisson processes used in the past efforts in this area\ncannot do that.\n", "  Quantum Cryptography is a rapidly developing field of research that benefits\nfrom the properties of Quantum Mechanics in performing cryptographic tasks.\nQuantum walks are a powerful model for quantum computation and very promising\nfor quantum information processing. In this paper, we present a quantum\npublic-key cryptographic system based on quantum walks. In particular, in the\nproposed protocol the public key is given by a quantum state generated by\nperforming a quantum walk. We show that the protocol is secure and analyze the\ncomplexity of public-key generation and encryption/decryption procedures.\n", "  Nitride films are promising for advanced optoelectronic and electronic device\napplications. However, some challenges continue to impede development of high\naluminum-containing devices. The two major difficulties are growth of high\ncrystalline quality films with aluminum-rich compositions, and efficiently\ndoping such films p-type. These problems have severely limited use of\naluminum-rich nitride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A way around these\nproblems is through use of a liquid-metal-enabled approach to molecular beam\nepitaxy. Although the presence of a liquid metal layer at the growth front is\nreminiscent of conventional liquid phase epitaxy, this approach is different in\nits details. Conventional liquid epitaxy is a near-thermodynamic equilibrium\nprocess which liquid-metal assisted molecular beam epitaxy is not. Growth of\naluminum-rich nitrides is primarily driven by the kinetics of the molecular\nvapor fluxes, and the surface diffusion of adatoms through a liquid metal layer\nbefore incorporation. This paper reports on growth of high crystalline quality\nand highly doped aluminum-containing nitride films. Measured optical and\nelectrical characterization data show that the approach is viable for growth of\natomically smooth aluminum-containing nitride heterostructures. Extremely high\np-type doping of up to $6 \\times 10$$^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and n-type doping of up\nto $1 \\times 10$$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ in Al$_{0.7}$Ga$_{0.3}$N films was achieved.\nUse of these metal-rich conditions is expected to have a significant impact on\nhigh efficiency and high power optoelectronic and electronic devices that\nrequire both high crystalline quality and highly doped (Al,Ga)N films.\n", "  A region-delimited gravitational wave field can be constructed, such that a\nsubset of geodesics crossing this region will move faster than nearby geodesics\nmoving entirely inside flat spacetime, along a preferred direction. Null\ngeodesics inside this region will move faster-than-light according to far away\nobservers. The waveform is synthesized from homogeneous plane wave solutions,\nand the resulting field is the gravitational equivalent of a Gaussian beam.\n", "  Based on the equivalence of the two different types of measurement protocols\nand the asymmetry between the Schr\\\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures, it has\nbeen previously proposed that negative sea fills the universe as a\nnondeterministic computation - a time-reversal process of the irreversible\ncomputations presented since the big bang. The goal of this paper is to extend\nthe proposed subjective universe model, i.e., the universe as a quantum\nmeasurement: Motivated by the relationship between quantum theory and classical\nprobability theory with continuity, it is argued that the frame of reference of\nthe observer may be identified with classical probability theory where its\nchoice, along with big bang singularity, should correspond to the quantum\nobservable. That is, the physical version of singularity resolution corresponds\nto the case, where big bang singularity is equivalent to the continuity of the\nnegative sea, or aether, filling the universe as a frame of reference of the\nobserver. Moreover, based on the holographic principle, we identify the choice\nof the observer with the degrees of freedom proportional to the Planck area on\nthe horizon. We also discuss that the continuity or infinity present in every\nformal language of choice acceptable in nondeterministic computation may be\nassociated with the universal grammar proposed by Chomsky in linguistics.\n", "  The formalism of classical particle dynamics is reinvestigated according to\nthe basic requirement of causal consistency, and a new equation of particle\ndynamics, which is more general and more in line with classical mechanics\nexperiments than Newton's second law, is obtained. More importantly, the\ninertial frame of reference is no longer required and the inertial force is no\nlonger introduced by hand. The new dynamical equation can be straightforwardly\napplied in any reference frame as long as which is irrotational with respect to\nthe absolute background of the universe. The nature of the inertial force is\nnothing but the real forces acting on the reference object. The essence of this\nreform of classical particle dynamics is just a drawback of traditional\nformalism in Newtonian mechanics being corrected. However, it may be more\nimportant that a logical derivation of this new particle dynamics equation\nstrongly suggests the existence of an absolute background for the whole space\nof the universe. In physical concepts, the absolute background for space does\nnot conflict with the relative length of the base unit of space in Einstein's\nSpecial Relativity and General Relativity. Furthermore, the size of the base\nunit of space should essentially be understood as the length of the line\nsegment, which is cut from the absolute background of space by the intrinsic\nphysical events.\n", "  gamma Dor-type oscillations have been discovered in the star HD218427 through\nsimultaneous uvby photometric observations carried out in the year 2003. A few\nHbeta-Crawford measurements were also collected for calibration purposes which\nplace this star well-located inside the gamma Dor instability region.\nDeficiency in metal content, similar to other well-defined gamma Dor stars, is\nfound in HD218427 and the possibility of a lambda Boo nature is discussed.\nFrequency analysis was carried out for different filters, the combined \"vby\"\nfilter was also used and five frequencies were found as significant with\nperiods ranging between 0.3 and 0.8 days. The recently developed Frequency\nRatio Method is used in order to perform an identification of the excited\nmodes. The results are consistent with an l=2 identification for all the modes\nand high radial quantum numbers (n~40) for the three main observed\nperiodicities. The possibility of multiplet structures is also discussed.\nHowever, no consistency is found when the Time-Dependent Convection treatment\nis used for modes discrimination. The disagreement can be due to the large\nrotation velocity taking place in HD218427 and, consequently, the significant\ncoupling between the modes.\n", "  We present a brief summary of our current results on the stellar distribution\nand population gradients of the resolved stars in the surroundings of ~50\nnearby disk galaxies, observed with space- (Hubble & Spitzer) and ground-based\ntelescopes (Subaru, VLT, BTA, Palomar, CFHT & INT). We examine the radial\n(in-plane) and vertical (extraplanar) distributions of resolved stars as a\nfunction of stellar age and metallicity by tracking changes in the\ncolor-magnitude diagram of face-on and edge-on galaxies. Our data show, that\nthe scale length and height of a stellar population increases with age, with\nthe oldest detected stellar populations identified at a large galactocentric\nradius or extraplanar height, out to typically a few kpc. In the most massive\nof the studied galaxies there is evidence for a break in number density and\ncolor gradients of evolved stars, which plausibly correspond to the thick disk\nand halo components of the galaxies. The ratio of intermediate-age to old stars\nin the outermost fields correlate with the gas fraction, while relative sizes\nof the thick-to-thin disks anticorrelate with galactic circular velocity.\n", "  We show here a series of energy gaps as in Hofstadter's butterfly, which have\nbeen shown to exist by Koshino et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 1062 (2001)] for\nanisotropic three-dimensional (3D) periodic systems in magnetic fields\n$\\Vec{B}$, also arise in the isotropic case unless $\\Vec{B}$ points in\nhigh-symmetry directions. Accompanying integer quantum Hall conductivities\n$(\\sigma_{xy}, \\sigma_{yz}, \\sigma_{zx})$ can, surprisingly, take values\n$\\propto (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)$ even for a fixed direction of $\\Vec{B}$\nunlike in the anisotropic case. We can intuitively explain the high-magnetic\nfield spectra and the 3D QHE in terms of quantum mechanical hopping by\nintroducing a ``duality'', which connects the 3D system in a strong $\\Vec{B}$\nwith another problem in a weak magnetic field $(\\propto 1/B)$.\n", "  This chapter is devoted to the computation of equilibrium (thermodynamic)\nproperties of quantum systems. In particular, we will be interested in the\nsituation where the interaction between particles is so strong that it cannot\nbe treated as a small perturbation. For weakly coupled systems many efficient\ntheoretical and computational techniques do exist. However, for strongly\ninteracting systems such as nonideal gases or plasmas, strongly correlated\nelectrons and so on, perturbation methods fail and alternative approaches are\nneeded. Among them, an extremely successful one is the Monte Carlo (MC) method\nwhich we are going to consider in this chapter.\n", "  Classical molecular dynamics (MD) is a well established and powerful tool in\nvarious fields of science, e.g. chemistry, plasma physics, cluster physics and\ncondensed matter physics. Objects of investigation are few-body systems and\nmany-body systems as well. The broadness and level of sophistication of this\ntechnique is documented in many monographs and reviews, see for example\n\\cite{Allan,Frenkel,mdhere}. Here we discuss the extension of MD to quantum\nsystems (QMD). There have been many attempts in this direction which differ\nfrom one another, depending on the type of system under consideration. One\ndirection of QMD has been developed for condensed matter systems and will not\ndiscussed here, e.g. \\cite{fermid}. In this chapter we are dealing with unbound\nelectrons as they occur in gases, fluids or plasmas. Here, one strategy is to\nreplace classical point particles by wave packets, e.g.\n\\cite{fermid,KTR94,zwicknagel06} which is quite successful. At the same time,\nthis method struggles with problems related to the dispersion of such a packet\nand difficulties to properly describe strong electron-ion interaction and bound\nstate formation. We, therefore, avoid such restrictions and consider a\ncompletely general alternative approach. We start discussion of quantum\ndynamics from a general consideration of quantum distribution functions.\n", "  We derive explicit formulas for the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the\nelliptic Calogero-Sutherland model as infinite series, to all orders and for\narbitrary particle numbers and coupling parameters. The eigenfunctions obtained\nprovide an elliptic deformation of the Jack polynomials. We prove in certain\nspecial cases that these series have a finite radius of convergence in the nome\n$q$ of the elliptic functions, including the two particle (= Lam\\'e) case for\nnon-integer coupling parameters.\n"]}
