However,\n17th-Century astronomers were uncertain of the long-term variation in the\ninclination of the Earth's axis and were suspicious of Ptolemy's equinox\nobservations. As a result, they produced a wide range of tropical years. Facing\nthis problem, Newton attempted to compute the length of the year on his own,\nusing the ancient equinox observations reported by a famous Greek astronomer\nHipparchus of Rhodes, ten in number. Though Newton had a very thin sample of\ndata, he obtained a tropical year only a few seconds longer than the correct\nlength. The reason lies in Newton's application of a technique similar to\nmodern regression analysis. Newton wrote down the first of the two so-called\n'normal equations' known from the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method. In that\nprocedure, Newton seems to have been the first to employ the mean (average)\nvalue of the data set, while the other leading astronomers of the era (Tycho\nBrahe, Galileo, and Kepler) used the median. Fifty years after Newton, in 1750,\nNewton's method was rediscovered and enhanced by Tobias Mayer. Remarkably, the\nsame regression method served with distinction in the late 1920s when the\nfounding fathers of modern cosmology, Georges Lemaitre (1927), Edwin Hubble\n(1929), and Willem de Sitter (1930), employed it to derive the Hubble constant.\n", "  Supervised statistical classification is a vital tool for satellite image\nprocessing. It is useful not only when a discrete result, such as feature\nextraction or surface type, is required, but also for continuum retrievals by\ndividing the quantity of interest into discrete ranges. Because of the high\nresolution of modern satellite instruments and because of the requirement for\nreal-time processing, any algorithm has to be fast to be useful. Here we\ndescribe an algorithm based on kernel estimation called Adaptive Gaussian\nFiltering that incorporates several innovations to produce superior efficiency\nas compared to three other popular methods: k-nearest-neighbour (KNN), Learning\nVector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This efficiency is\ngained with no compromises: accuracy is maintained, while estimates of the\nconditional probabilities are returned. These are useful not only to gauge the\naccuracy of an estimate in the absence of its true value, but also to\nre-calibrate a retrieved image and as a proxy for a discretized continuum\nvariable. The algorithm is demonstrated and compared with the other three on a\npair of synthetic test classes and to map the waterways of the Netherlands.\nSoftware may be found at: http://libagf.sourceforge.net.\n", "  Graphene, a flat monolayer of carbon atoms packed tightly into a two\ndimensional hexagonal lattice, has unusual electronic properties which have\nmany promising nanoelectronic applications. Recent Low Energy Electron\nMicroscopy (LEEM) experiments show that the step edge velocity of epitaxially\ngrown 2D graphene islands on Ru(0001) varies with the fifth power of the\nsupersaturation of carbon adatoms. This suggests that graphene islands grow by\nthe addition of clusters of five atoms rather than by the usual mechanism of\nsingle adatom attachment.\n  We have carried out Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in order to further\ninvestigate the general scenario of epitaxial growth by the attachment of\nmobile clusters of atoms. We did not seek to directly replicate the Gr/Ru(0001)\nsystem but instead considered a model involving mobile tetramers of atoms on a\nsquare lattice. Our results show that the energy barrier for tetramer break up\nand the number of tetramers that must collide in order to nucleate an immobile\nisland are the important parameters for determining whether, as in the\nGr/Ru(0001) system, the adatom density at the onset of island nucleation is an\nincreasing function of temperature. A relatively large energy barrier for\nadatom attachment to islands is required in order for our model to produce an\nequilibrium adatom density that is a large fraction of the nucleation density.\nA large energy barrier for tetramer attachment to islands is also needed for\nthe island density to dramatically decrease with increasing temperature. We\nshow that islands grow with a velocity that varies with the fourth power of the\nsupersaturation of adatoms when tetramer attachment is the dominant process for\nisland growth.\n", "  A model is proposed to address issues on the precise background evaluation\ndue to the complex data structure defined by the delayed coincidence method,\nwhich is widely used in reactor electron-antineutrino oscillation experiments.\nIn this model, the effects from the muon veto, uncorrelated random background,\ncoincident signal and background are all studied with the analytical solutions,\nsimplifying the estimation of the systematic uncertainties of signal efficiency\nand accidental background rate determined by the unstable single rate. The\nresult of calculation is validated numerically with a number of simulation\nstudies and is also applied and validated in the recent Daya Bay\nhydrogen-capture based oscillation measurement.\n", "  This paper introduces the exact, analytic integration of all final state\nvariables for the process of nonlinear Compton scattering in an intense plane\nwave laser pulse, improving upon a previously slow and challenging numerical\napproach. Computationally simple and insightful formulae are derived for the\ntotal scattering probability and mean energy-momentum of the emitted radiation.\nThe general form of the effective mass appears explicitely. We consider several\nlimiting cases, and present a quantum correction to Larmor's formula. Numerical\nresults are plotted and analysed in detail.\n", "  Effects of nuclear dynamics on the energetics of polythiophene relevant for\nthe performance of organic solar cells are studied for the first time. Nuclear\nmotions change the expectation values of frontier orbital energies and the band\ngap by about 0.1 eV vs. values at the equilibrium geometry, which is expected\nto have a significant effect on light absorption, charge separation, and donor\nregeneration. A new molecular dynamics (MD) algorithm, which accounts for the\nquantum nature of vibrations, is introduced. It reproduces effects of\ntemperature and deuteration which are lost in the standard MD. Inclusion of\nquantized vibrations leads to a broadening of the band gap and of energy levels\nby about 20% at 300K, while having little effect on their expectation values\n(which change by up to 0.03 eV). Increase in temperature from 300K to 400K and\ndeuteration cause an additional broadening of the spectrum by about 26% and\n21%, respectively.\n", "  We propose a novel technique for analyzing the long-time asymptotics of\nintegrable wave equations in the case when the underlying isospectral problem\nhas purely discrete spectrum. To this end, we introduce a natural coupling\nproblem for entire functions, which serves as a replacement for the usual\nRiemann-Hilbert problem, which does not apply in these cases. As a prototypical\nexample, we investigate the long-time asymptotics of the dispersionless\nCamassa-Holm equation.\n", "  We study molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) structures generated by folding single-\nand bilayer MoS2 flakes. We find that this modified layer stacking leads to a\ndecrease in the interlayer coupling and an enhancement of the photoluminescence\nemission yield. We additionally find that folded single-layer MoS2 structures\nshow a contribution to photoluminescence spectra of both neutral and charged\nexcitons, which is a characteristic feature of single-layer MoS2 that has not\nbeen observed in multilayer MoS2. The results presented here open the door to\nfabrication of multilayered MoS2 samples with high optical absorption while\nmaintaining the advantageous enhanced photoluminescence emission of\nsingle-layer MoS2 by controllably twisting the MoS2 layers.\n", "  Networks play a prominent role in the study of complex systems of interacting\nentities in biology, sociology, and economics. Despite this diversity, we\ndemonstrate here that a statistical model decomposing networks into matching\nand centrality components provides a comprehensive and unifying quantification\nof their architecture. First we show, for a diverse set of networks, that this\ndecomposition provides an extremely tight fit to observed networks.\nConsequently, the model allows very accurate prediction of missing links in\npartially known networks. Second, when node characteristics are known, we show\nhow the matching-centrality decomposition can be related to this external\ninformation. Consequently, it offers a simple and versatile tool to explore how\nnode characteristics explain network architecture. Finally, we demonstrate the\nefficiency and flexibility of the model to forecast the links that a novel node\nwould create if it were to join an existing network.\n", "  We present new measurements of the abundance of galaxies with a given\ncircular velocity in the Local Volume: a region centered on the Milky Way\nGalaxy and extending to distance 10Mpc. The sample of 750 mostly dwarf galaxies\nprovides a unique opportunity to study the abundance and properties of galaxies\ndown to absolute magnitudes MB= -10, and virial masses Mvir= 1e9Msun. We find\nthat the standard LCDM model gives remarkably accurate estimates for the\nvelocity function of galaxies with circular velocities V>60kms and\ncorresponding virial masses Mvir> 3e10Msun, but it badly fails by\nover-predicting 5 times the abundance of large dwarfs with velocities V=\n30-50kms. The Warm Dark Matter models cannot explain the data either,\nregardless of mass of the WDM particle. Just as in previous observational\nstudies, we find a shallow asymptotic slope dN/dlog V = V**alpha, alpha =-1 of\nthe velocity function, which is inconsistent with the standard LCDM model that\npredicts the slope alpha =-3. Though reminiscent to the known overabundance of\nsatellites problem, the overabundance of field galaxies is a much more\ndifficult problem. For the LCDM model to survive, in the 10Mpc radius of the\nMilky Way there should be 1000 dark galaxies with virial mass Mvir= 1e10Msun,\nextremely low surface brightness and no detectable HI gas. So far none of this\ntype of galaxies have been discovered.\n", "  Integrated optics has distinct advantages for applications in space because\nit integrates many elements onto a monolithic, robust chip. As the development\nof different building blocks for integrated optics advances, it is of interest\nto answer the important question of their resistance with respect to ionizing\nradiation. Here we investigate effects of proton radiation on high-Q silicon\nnitride microresonators formed by a waveguide ring. We show that the\nirradiation with high-energy protons has no lasting effect on the linear\noptical losses of the microresonators.\n", "  While Si is an effective insertion type anode for Li-ion batteries,\ncrystalline Si has been shown to be unsuitable for Na and Mg storage due, in\nparticular, to insufficient binding strength. It has recently been reported\nthat Si nanowires could be synthesized with high-concentration (several atomic\n%) and dispersed Al doping. Here we show based on density functional theory\ncalculations that Al doping significantly improves the energetics for Na and Mg\ninsertion, specifically, making it thermodynamically favored versus vacuum\nreference states. For high Al concentrations, the energy of Mg in Al-doped Si\napproaches the cohesive energy of Mg. However, the migration barriers for the\ndiffusion of Li (0.57-0.70 eV), Na (1.07-1.19 eV) and Mg (0.97-1.18 eV) in\nAl-doped Si are found to remain about as high as in pure Si, likely preventing\neffective electrochemical sodiation and magnesiation.\n", "  Simulation of quantum systems promises to deliver physical and chemical\npredictions for the frontiers of technology. Unfortunately, the exact\nrepresentation of these systems is plagued by the exponential growth of\ndimension with the number of particles, or colloquially, the curse of\ndimensionality. The success of approximation methods has hinged on the relative\nsimplicity of physical systems with respect to the exponentially complex worst\ncase. Exploiting this relative simplicity has required detailed knowledge of\nthe physical system under study. In this work, we introduce a general and\nefficient black box method for many-body quantum systems that utilizes\ntechnology from compressed sensing to find the most compact wavefunction\npossible without detailed knowledge of the system. It is a Multicomponent\nAdaptive Greedy Iterative Compression (MAGIC) scheme. No knowledge is assumed\nin the structure of the problem other than correct particle statistics. This\nmethod can be applied to many quantum systems such as spins, qubits,\noscillators, or electronic systems. As an application, we use this technique to\ncompute ground state electronic wavefunctions of hydrogen fluoride and recover\n98% of the basis set correlation energy or equivalently 99.996% of the total\nenergy with $50$ configurations out of a possible $10^7$. Building from this\ncompactness, we introduce the idea of nuclear union configuration interaction\nfor improving the description of reaction coordinates and use it to study the\ndissociation of hydrogen fluoride and the helium dimer.\n", "  Any Calabi-Yau threefold X with infinite fundamental group admits an \\'etale\nGalois covering either by an abelian threefold or by the product of a K3\nsurface and an elliptic curve. We call X of type A in the former case and of\ntype K in the latter case. In this paper, we provide the full classification of\nCalabi-Yau threefolds of type K, based on Oguiso and Sakurai's work. Together\nwith a refinement of Oguiso and Sakurai's result on Calabi-Yau threefolds of\ntype A, we finally complete the classification of Calabi-Yau threefolds with\ninfinite fundamental group.\n", "  The maximally entangled states are excellent candidates for achieving\nHeisenberg-limited measurements in ideal quantum metrology, however, they are\nfragile against dissipation such as particle losses and their achievable\nprecisions may become even worse than the standard quantum limit (SQL). Here we\npresent a robust high-precision measurement scheme via spin cat states (a kind\nof non-Gaussian entangled states in superposition of two spin coherent states)\nin the presence of particle losses. The input spin cat states are of excellent\nrobustness against particle losses and their achievable precisions may still\nbeat the SQL. For realistic measurements based upon our scheme, comparing with\nthe population measurement, the parity measurement is more suitable for\nyielding higher precisions. In phase measurement with realistic dissipative\nsystems of bosons, our scheme provides a robust and realizable way to achieve\nhigh-precision measurements beyond the SQL.\n", "  We consider a holographic dual model for defect conformal field theories\n(DCFT) in which we include the backreaction of the defect on the dual geometry.\nIn particular, we consider a dual gravity system in which a two-dimensional\nhypersurface with matter fields, the brane, is embedded into a\nthree-dimensional asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Motivated by recent\nproposals for holographic duals of boundary conformal field theories (BCFT), we\nassume the geometry of the brane to be determined by Israel junction\nconditions. We show that these conditions are intimately related to the energy\nconditions for the brane matter fields, and explain how these energy conditions\nconstrain the possible geometries. This has implications for the holographic\nentanglement entropy in particular. Moreover, we give exact analytical\nsolutions for the case where the matter content of the brane is a perfect\nfluid, which in a particular case corresponds to a free massless scalar field.\nFinally, we describe how our results may be particularly useful for extending a\nrecent proposal for a holographic Kondo model.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on the Heisenberg S=1/2 quantum spin liquid\ncandidate material kapellasite, we classify all possible chiral (time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking) spin liquids with fermionic spinons on the kagome lattice.\nWe obtain the phase diagram for the physically relevant extended Heisenberg\nmodel, comparing the energies of a wide range of microscopic variational wave\nfunctions. We propose that, at low temperature, kapellasite exhibits a gapless\nchiral spin liquid phase with spinon Fermi surfaces. This two-dimensional state\ninherits many properties of the nearby one-dimensional phase of decoupled\nanti-ferromagnetic spin chains, but also shows some remarkable differences. We\ndiscuss the spin structure factors and other physical properties.\n", "  We present a complete analytical and numerical solution of the Typical Medium\nTheory (TMT) for the Anderson metal-insulator transition. In this theory, we\nself-consistently calculate the typical amplitude of the electron wave-We\npresent a complete analytical and numerical solution of the Typical Medium\nTheory (TMT) for the Anderson metal-insulator transition. This approach\nself-consistently calculates the typical amplitude of the electronic\nwave-functions, thus representing the conceptually simplest order-parameter\ntheory for the Anderson transition. We identify all possible universality\nclasses for the critical behavior, which can be found within such a mean-field\napproach. This provides insights into how interaction-induced renormalizations\nof the disorder potential may produce qualitative modifications of the critical\nbehavior. We also formulate a simplified description of the leading critical\nbehavior, thus obtaining an effective Landau theory for Anderson localization.\n", "  We investigate a scenario where quantum correlations affect the gravitational\nfield. We show that quantum correlations between particles occupying different\npositions have an effect on the gravitational field. We find that the small\nperturbations induced by the entanglement depend on the amount of entanglement\nand vanish for vanishing quantum correlations. Our results suggest that there\nis a form of entanglement that has a weight, since it affects the gravitational\nfield. This conclusion may lead towards a new understanding of the role of\nquantum correlations within the overlap of relativistic and quantum theories.\n", "  Magnetic frustration in three dimensions (3D) manifests itself in the\nspin-$\\frac12$ insulator Li$_2$CuW$_2$O$_8$. Density-functional band-structure\ncalculations reveal a peculiar spin lattice built of triangular planes with\nfrustrated interplane couplings. The saturation field of 29 T contrasts with\nthe susceptibility maximum at 8.5 K and a relatively low N\\'eel temperature\n$T_N\\simeq 3.9$ K. Magnetic order below $T_N$ is collinear with the propagation\nvector $(0,\\frac12,0)$ and an ordered moment of 0.65(4) $\\mu_B$ according to\nneutron diffraction data. This reduced ordered moment together with the low\nmaximum of the magnetic specific heat ($C^{\\max}/R\\simeq 0.35$) pinpoint strong\nmagnetic frustration in 3D. Collinear magnetic order suggests that quantum\nfluctuations play crucial role in this system, where a non-collinear spiral\nstate would be stabilized classically.\n", "  In this paper, we calculate the effective gravitational mass of\nAy\\'{o}n-Beato and Garc\\'{\\i}a regular (non-singular) static spherically\nsymmetric asymptotically Minkowskian metric that is a solution to Einstein's\nequations coupled with a nonlinear electromagnetic field. The effective\ngravitational mass is negative, zero, or positive that depends on the ratio of\nmagnitude of electric charge to the ADM mass and the ratio of the radial\ndistance to the ADM mass. As expected, at large value of radial distance, our\nresult gives effective gravitational mass of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric.\n", "  In the presence of random hyperfine fields, the noise spectrum, \\delta\ns_{\\omega}^2, of a spin ensemble represents a narrow peak centered at \\omega =0\nand a broad \"wing\" reflecting the distribution of the hyperfine fields. In the\npresence of an ac drive, the dynamics of a single spin acquires additional\nharmonics at frequencies determined by both, the drive frequency and the local\nfield. These harmonics are reflected as additional peaks in the noise spectrum.\nWe study how the ensemble-averaged \\delta s_{\\omega}^2 evolves with the drive\namplitude, \\omega_dr (in the frequency units). Our main finding is that\nadditional peaks in the spectrum, caused by the drive, remain sharp even when\n\\omega_dr is much smaller than the typical hyperfine field. The reason is that\nthe drive affects only the spins for which the local Larmour frequency is close\nto the drive frequency. The shape of the low-frequency \"Rabi\"-peak in \\delta\ns_{\\omega}^2 is universal with both, the position and the width, being of the\norder of \\omega_dr. When the drive amplitude exceeds the width of the hyperfine\nfield distribution, the noise spectrum transforms into a set of sharp peaks\ncentered at harmonics of the drive frequency.\n", "  The recently suggested mechanism [Y. Song and H. Dery, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113,\n047205 (2014)] of the three-terminal spin transport is based on the resonant\ntunneling of electrons between ferromagnetic and normal electrodes via an\nimpurity. The sensitivity of current to a weak external magnetic field stems\nfrom a spin blockade, which, in turn, is enabled by strong on-site repulsion.\nWe demonstrate that this sensitivity exists even in the absence of repulsion\nwhen a single-particle description applies. Within this description, we\ncalculate exactly the resonant-tunneling current between the electrodes. The\nmechanism of magnetoresistance, completely different from the spin blocking,\nhas its origin in the interference of virtual tunneling amplitudes. Spin\nimbalance in ferromagnetic electrode is responsible for this interference and\nthe resulting coupling of the Zeeman levels. This coupling also affects the\ncurrent in the correlated regime.\n", "  We present a comparative ab initio computational study of sodium and lithium\nstorage in amorphous (glassy) carbon (a-C) vs. graphite. Amorphous structures\nare obtained by fitting stochastically generated structures to a reference\nradial distribution function. Li insertion is thermodynamically favored in both\ngraphite and a-C. While sodium insertion is thermodynamically unfavored in\ngraphite, a-C possesses multiple insertion sites with binding energies stronger\nthan Na cohesive energy, making it usable as anode material for Na-ion\nbatteries.\n", "  In the hole-doped cuprates, a small amount of carriers suppresses\nantiferromagnetism and induces superconductivity. In the electron-doped\ncuprates, on the other hand, superconductivity appears only in a narrow range\nof high electron concentration ($\\sim$ doped Ce content) after reduction\nannealing, and strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlation persists in the\nsuperconducting phase. Recently, Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$\n(PLCCO) bulk single crystals annealed by a \"protect annealing\" method showed a\nhigh $T_c$ of $\\sim$ 27 K for small Ce content down to $x \\sim 0.05$. By\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of PLCCO\ncrystals, we observed a sharp quasi-particle peak on the entire Fermi surface\nwithout signature of an AFM pseudogap unlike all the previous work, indicating\na dramatic reduction of AFM correlation length and/or of magnetic moments. The\nsuperconducting state was found to extend over a wide electron concentration\nrange. The present ARPES results fundamentally change the long-standing picture\non the electronic structure in the electron-doped regime.\n", "  Li and Na attachment to free tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) molecules and TCNE\nadsorbed on doped graphene is studied using density functional theory. While\nTCNE is adsorbed only weakly on ideal graphene, we identified a configuration\nin which TCNE is chemisorbed on Al-doped graphene via molecule C atom and a\nsurface oxygen atom. Up to four (five) Li and Na atoms can be stored on both\nfree (adsorbed) TCNE with binding energies stronger than cohesive energies of\nthe Li and Na metals. When storing up to three atoms per molecule, it should be\npossible to avoid reduction of common battery electrolytes. TCNE immobilized on\na conducting graphene-based substrate could therefore become an efficient anode\nmaterial for organic Li and Na ion batteries. Importantly, there is no\nsignificant difference either in specific capacity (per unit mass of material\nexcluding Li/Na) nor in voltage between Li and Na storage, which makes this\nkind of approach very promising for post-Li storage in general.\n", "  In this work the synthesis of ZrO$_{2}$-CeO$_{2}$ and\nZrO$_{2}$-CeO$_{2}$/SiO$_{2}$ were developed, based on the process to form\nordered mesoporous materials such as SBA-15 silica. The triblock copolymer\nPluronic P-123 was used as template, aiming to obtain crystalline single phase\nwalls and larger specific surface area, for future applications in catalysis.\nSAXS and XRD results showed a relationship between ordered pores and the\nmaterial crystallization. 90% of CeO$_{2}$ leaded to single phase homogeneous\nceria-zirconia solid solution of cubic fluorite structure (Fm$\\bar{3}$m). The\nSiO$_{2}$ addition improved structural and textural properties as well as the\nreduction behavior at lower temperatures, investigated by XANES measurements\nunder H$_{2}$ atmosphere.\n", "  We study theoretically the dipole radiation of a hydrogen atom driven by an\nintense sub-cycle pulse. The time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\nsystem is solved by ab initio calculation to obtain the dipole response.\nRemarkably, a narrowband emission lasting longer than the driving pulse appears\nat a frequency just above the ionization threshold. An additional calculation\nusing the strong field approximation also recovers this emission, which\nsuggests that it corresponds to the oscillation of nearly-bound electrons that\nbehave similarly to Rydberg electrons. The predicted phenomenon is unique to\nultrashort driving pulses but not specific to any particular atomic structure.\n", "  We analyze the rate of convergence of the local statistics of Dyson Brownian\nmotion to the GOE/GUE for short times $t=o(1)$ with deterministic initial data\nV . Our main result states that if the density of states of $V$ is bounded both\nabove and away from $0$ down to scales $\\ell \\ll t$ in a small interval of size\n$G \\gg t$ around an energy $E_0$, then the local statistics coincide with the\nGOE/GUE near the energy $E_0$ after time $t$. Our methods are partly based on\nthe idea of coupling two Dyson Brownian motions from [6], the parabolic\nregularity result of [15], and the eigenvalue rigidity results of [21].\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on spin pumping from a ferromagnet into\norganic materials in which the charge transport is due to hopping, we study\ntheoretically the generation and propagation of spin current in a hopping\ninsulator. Unlike metals, the spin polarization at the boundary with\nferromagnet is created as a result of magnon absorption within pairs of\nlocalized states and it spreads following the current-currying resistor network\n(although the charge current is absent). We consider a classic resonant\nmechanism of the ac absorption in insulators and adapt it to the absorption of\nmagnons. A strong enhancement of pumping efficiency is predicted when the\nZeeman splitting of the localized states in external magnetic field is equal to\nthe frequency of ferromagnetic resonance. Under this condition the absorption\nof a magnon takes place within individual sites.\n", "  We study the contribution of Galactic sources to the flux of astrophysical\nneutrinos recently observed by the IceCube Collaboration. We show that in the\nsimplest model of homogeneous and isotropic cosmic ray diffusion in the Milky\nWay the Galactic diffuse neutrino emission consistent with $\\gamma$-ray\n(Fermi-LAT) and cosmic ray data (KASCADE, KASCADE-Grande and CREAM) is expected\nto account for only $4\\%-8\\%$ of the IceCube flux above 60 TeV. Direct neutrino\nemission from cosmic ray-gas ($pp$) interactions in the sources would require\nan unusually large average opacity above 0.01. On the other hand, we find that\nthe IceCube events already probe Galactic neutrino scenarios via the\ndistribution of event arrival directions. Based on the latter, we show that\nmost Galactic scenarios can only have a limited contribution to the\nastrophysical signal: diffuse Galactic emission ($\\lesssim50\\%$), quasi-diffuse\nemission of neutrino sources ($\\lesssim65\\%$), extended diffuse emission from\nthe Fermi Bubbles ($\\lesssim25\\%$) or unidentified TeV $\\gamma$-ray sources\n($\\lesssim25\\%$). The arguments discussed here leave, at present, dark matter\ndecay unconstrained.\n", "  The LOT-G3 is designed to be a versatile equipment that perform several\nsimple experiments for use in helping the physics classes for high school. Easy\nconstruction, low cost, using easily accessible materials. Its construction\ninvolves simple practices and knowledge of electromagnetism. It has the\nfunction of a plasma globe to demonstrate the ionization of a low pressure gas,\nas well as the formation of magnetic field. Can be used as sanitizer closed\nenvironments such as automotive vehicles in ozonator function, demonstrating\nthe ionization of oxygen in the atmosphere, producing ozone, essential to life\non earth. And as a sparks transmitter, low power, low frequency modulated\ncontinuous wave in (CW), for signals in Morse code. Therefore the equipment\nhere called LOT-G3, has three functions: a plasma lamp, ozonator and CW\ntransmitter.\n", "  We investigate the long time steady-state dissolution of CO$_{2}$ in a deep\nsaline aqquifer in the presence of a background hydrological flow. In\nsteady-state, the distribution of CO$_2$ in the groundwater upstream of the\naquifer involves a balance between three competing effects: (i) the\nbuoyancy-driven flow of CO$_2$ saturated water; (ii) the diffusion of CO$_2$\nfrom saturated to under-saturated water; and (iii) the advection associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. This leads to three limiting regimes. In the\nlimit of very slow diffusion, a nearly static intrusion of dense fluid may\nextend a finite distance upstream, balanced by the pressure gradient associated\nwith the oncoming background flow. In the limit of fast diffusion relative to\nthe flow, a gradient zone may become established in which the along aquifer\ndiffusive flux balances the advection associated with the background flow.\nHowever, if the buoyancy-driven flow speed exceeds the background hydrological\nflow speed, then a third, intermediate regime may become established. In this\nregime, a convective recirculation develops upstream of the anticline involving\nthe vertical diffusion of CO$_2$ from an upstream propagating flow of dense\nCO$_2$ saturated water into the downstream propagating flow of CO$_2$\nunsaturated water. For each limiting case, we find analytical solutions for the\ndistribution of CO$_2$ upstream of the anticline, and test our analysis with\nfull numerical simulations. A key result is that, although there may be very\ndifferent controls on the distribution and extent of CO$_2$ bearing water\nupstream of the anticline, in each case the dissolution rate is given by the\nproduct of the background volume flux and the difference in concentration\nbetween the CO$_2$ saturated water and the original aquifer water upstream.\n", "  Magnetite (Fe3O4) is one of the most actively studied materials with a famous\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT), so-called the Verwey transition at around 123\nK. Despite the recent progress in synthesis and characterization of Fe3O4\nnanocrystals (NCs), it is still an open question how the Verwey transition\nchanges on a nanometer scale. We herein report the systematic studies on size\ndependence of the Verwey transition of stoichiometric Fe3O4 NCs. We have\nsuccessfully synthesized stoichiometric and uniform-sized Fe3O4 NCs with sizes\nranging from 5 to 100 nm. These stoichiometric Fe3O4 NCs show the Verwey\ntransition when they are characterized by conductance, magnetization, cryo-XRD,\nand heat capacity measurements. The Verwey transition is weakly size-dependent\nand becomes suppressed in NCs smaller than 20 nm before disappearing completely\nfor less than 6 nm, which is a clear, yet highly interesting indication of a\nsize effect of this well-known phenomena. Our current work will shed new light\non this ages-old problem of Verwey transition.\n", "  A simple but efficient spectral approach for analyzing the community\nstructure of complex networks is introduced. It works the same way for all\ntypes of networks, by spectrally splitting the adjacency matrix into a\n\"unipartite\" and a \"multipartite\" component. These two matrices reveal the\nstructure of the network from different perspectives and can be analyzed at\ndifferent levels of detail. Their entries, or the entries of their lower-rank\napproximations, provide measures of the affinity or antagonism between the\nnodes that highlight the communities and the \"gateway\" links that connect them\ntogether. An algorithm is then proposed to achieve the automatic assignment of\nthe nodes to communities based on the information provided by either matrix.\nThis algorithm naturally generates overlapping communities but can also be\ntuned to eliminate the overlaps.\n", "  Spectral measurements in the infrared (IR) optical range provide unique\nfingerprints of materials which are useful for material analysis, environmental\nsensing, and health diagnostics. Current IR spectroscopy techniques require the\nuse of optical equipment suited for operation in the IR range, which faces\nchallenges of inferior performance and high cost. Here we develop a\nspectroscopy technique, which allows spectral measurements in the IR range\nusing visible spectral range components. The technique is based on nonlinear\ninterference of infrared and visible photons, produced via Spontaneous\nParametric Down Conversion (SPDC). The intensity interference pattern for a\nvisible photon depends on the phase of an IR photon, which travels through the\nmedia. This allows determining properties of the media in the IR range from the\nmeasurements of visible photons. The technique can substitute and/or complement\nconventional IR spectroscopy techniques, as it uses well-developed optical\ncomponents for the visible range.\n", "  We study photon-ALP conversion by resonance effects in the magnetized plasma\nof galaxy clusters and compare the predicted distortion of the cosmic microwave\nbackground spectrum in the direction of such objects to measurements of the\nthermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Using galaxy cluster models based on current\nknowledge, we obtain upper limits on the photon-ALP coupling constant $g$ of\n$\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$). The constraints apply to the mass\nrange of $2\\cdot 10^{-14}$ eV $ \\lesssim m_\\text{ALP} \\lesssim 3\\cdot 10^{-12}$\neV in which resonant photon-ALP conversions can occur. These limits are\nslightly stronger than current limits, and furthermore provide an independent\nconstraint. We find that a next generation PRISM-like experiment would allow\nlimits down to $g \\approx \\mathcal{O} (10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1})$, two orders of\nmagnitude stronger than the currently strongest limits in this mass range.\n", "  Ocean rogue waves (RW) -huge solitary waves- have for long triggered the\ninterest of scientists. RWs emerge in a complex environment and it is still\ndubious the importance of linear versus nonlinear processes. Recent works have\ndemonstrated that RWs appear in various other physical systems such as\nmicrowaves, nonlinear crystals, cold atoms, etc. In this work we investigate\noptical wave propagation in strongly scattering random lattices embedded in the\nbulk of transparent glasses. In the linear regime we observe the appearance of\nRWs that depend solely on the scattering properties of the medium.\nInterestingly, the addition of nonlinearity does not modify the RW statistics,\nwhile as the nonlinearities are increased multiple-filamentation and intensity\nclamping destroy the RW statistics. Numerical simulations agree nicely with the\nexperimental findings and altogether prove that optical rogue waves are\ngenerated through the linear strong scattering in such complex environments.\n", "  We construct the 1D $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic model based on the solution\nof Yang-Baxter equation and express the model by three types of fermions. It is\nshown that the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic chain possesses both triple\ndegenerate ground states and non-trivial topological winding number. Hence, the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic model is a direct generalization of 1D\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ Kitaev model. Both the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ model\ncan be obtained from Yang-Baxter equation. On the other hand, to show the\nalgebra of parafermionic tripling intuitively, we define a new 3-body\nHamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{123}$ based on Yang-Baxter equation. Different from the\nMajorana doubling, the $\\hat{H}_{123}$ holds triple degeneracy at each of\nenergy levels. The triple degeneracy is protected by two symmetry operators of\nthe system, $\\omega$-parity $P$($\\omega=e^{{\\textrm{i}\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}}$) and\nemergent parafermionic operator $\\Gamma$, which are the generalizations of\nparity $P_{M}$ and emergent Majorana operator in Lee-Wilczek model,\nrespectively. Both the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic model and $\\hat{H}_{123}$\ncan be viewed as SU(3) models in color space. In comparison with the Majorana\nmodels for SU(2), it turns out that the SU(3) models are truly the\ngeneralization of Majorana models resultant from Yang-Baxter equation.\n", "  The crux of the black hole information paradox is related to the fact that\nthe complete information about the initial state of a quantum field in a\ncollapsing spacetime is not available to future asymptotic observers, belying\nthe expectations from a unitary quantum theory. We study the imprints of the\ninitial quantum state contained in a specific class of distortions of the black\nhole radiation and identify the classes of in-states which can be\npartially/fully reconstructed from the information contained within. Even for\nthe general in-state, we can uncover some specific information. These results\nsuggest that a \\textit{classical} collapse scenario ignores this richness of\ninformation in the resulting spectrum and a consistent quantum treatment of the\nentire collapse process might allow us to retrieve much more information from\nthe spectrum of the final radiation.\n", "  Metadynamics (MTD) is a very powerful technique to sample high-dimensional\nfree energy landscapes, and due to its self-guiding property, the method has\nbeen successful in studying complex reactions and conformational changes. MTD\nsampling is based on filling the free energy basins by biasing potentials and\nthus for cases with flat, broad and unbound free energy wells, the\ncomputational time to sample them becomes very large. To alleviate this\nproblem, we combine the standard Umbrella Sampling (US) technique with MTD to\nsample orthogonal collective variables (CVs) in a simultaneous way. Within this\nscheme, we construct the equilibrium distribution of CVs from biased\ndistributions obtained from independent MTD simulations with umbrella\npotentials. Reweighting is carried out by a procedure that combines US\nreweighting and Tiwary-Parrinello MTD reweighting within the Weighted Histogram\nAnalysis Method (WHAM). The approach is ideal for a controlled sampling of a CV\nin a MTD simulation, making it computationally efficient in sampling flat,\nbroad and unbound free energy surfaces. This technique also allows for a\ndistributed sampling of a high-dimensional free energy surface, further\nincreasing the computational efficiency in sampling. We demonstrate the\napplication of this technique in sampling high-dimensional surface for various\nchemical reactions using ab initio and QM/MM hybrid molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Further, in order to carry out MTD bias reweighting for computing\nforward reaction barriers in ab initio or QM/MM simulations, we propose a\ncomputationally affordable approach that does not require recrossing\ntrajectories.\n", "  We investigate the potential energy curves of rare-gas dimers with various\nranges and strengths of interparticle interactions (nuclear-electron,\nelectron-electron, and nuclear-nuclear interactions). Our investigation is\nbased on the highly accurate coupled-cluster theory associated with those\ninterparticle interactions. For comparison, the performance of the\ncorresponding Hartree-Fock theory, second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation\ntheory, and density functional theory is also investigated. Our results reveal\nthat when the interparticle interactions retain the long-range Coulomb tails,\nthe nature of van der Waals interactions in the rare-gas dimers remains\nsimilar. By contrast, when the interparticle interactions are sufficiently\nshort-range, the conventional van der Waals interactions in the rare-gas dimers\ncompletely disappear, yielding purely repulsive potential energy curves.\n", "  We report artifact-free CH3NH3PbI3 optical constants extracted from\nultra-smooth perovskite layers without air exposure and assign all the optical\ntransitions in the visible/ultraviolet region unambiguously based on density\nfunctional theory (DFT) analysis that assumes a simple pseudo-cubic crystal\nstructure. From the self-consistent spectroscopic ellipsometry analysis of the\nultra-smooth CH3NH3PbI3 layers, we find that the absorption coefficients of\nCH3NH3PbI3 (alpha = 3.8 x 10^4 cm-1 at 2.0 eV) are comparable to those of\nCuInGaSe2 and CdTe, and high alpha values reported in earlier studies are\noverestimated seriously by extensive surface roughness of CH3NH3PbI3 layers.\nThe polarization-dependent DFT calculations show that CH3NH3+ interacts\nstrongly with the PbI3- cage, modifying the CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric function in\nthe visible region rather significantly. When the effect of CH3NH3+ on the\noptical transition is eliminated in the DFT calculation, CH3NH3PbI3 dielectric\nfunction deduced from DFT shows excellent agreement with the experimental\nresult. As a result, distinct optical transitions observed at E0 (Eg) = 1.61\neV, E1 = 2.53 eV, and E2 = 3.24 eV in CH3NH3PbI3 are attributed to the direct\nsemiconductor-type transitions at the R, M, and X points in the pseudo-cubic\nBrillouin zone, respectively. We further perform the quantum efficiency (QE)\nanalysis for a standard hybrid-perovskite solar cell incorporating a mesoporous\nTiO2 layer and demonstrate that the QE spectrum can be reproduced almost\nperfectly when the revised CH3NH3PbI3 optical constants are employed.\nDepth-resolved QE simulations confirm that Jsc is limited by the material's\nlonger wavelength response and indicate the importance of optical confinement\nand long carrier diffusion lengths in hybrid perovskite solar cells.\n", "  We present a range of physics results for central exclusive production\nprocesses at the LHC, using the new SuperChic 2 Monte Carlo event generator.\nThis includes significant theoretical improvements and updates, most\nimportantly a fully differential treatment of the soft survival factor, as well\nas a greater number of generated processes. We provide an overview of the\nlatest theoretical framework, and consider in detail a selection of final\nstates, namely exclusive 2 and 3 jets, photoproduced vector mesons, two-photon\ninitiated muon and $W$ boson pairs and heavy $\\chi_{c,b}$ quarkonia.\n", "  Malaria is a mosquito-borne, lethal disease that affects millions and kills\nhundreds of thousands of people each year. In this paper, we develop a model\nfor allocating malaria interventions across geographic regions and time,\nsubject to budget constraints, with the aim of minimizing the number of\nperson-days of malaria infection. The model considers a range of several\nconditions: climatic characteristics, treatment efficacy, distribution costs,\nand treatment coverage. We couple an expanded susceptible-infected-recovered\n(SIR) compartment model for the disease dynamics with an integer linear\nprogramming (ILP) model for selecting the disease interventions. Our model\nproduces an intervention plan for all regions, identifying which combination of\ninterventions, with which level of coverage, to use in each region and year in\na five-year planning horizon. Simulations using the model yield high-level,\nqualitative insights on optimal intervention policies: The optimal policy is\ndifferent when considering a five-year time horizon than when considering only\na single year, due to the effects that interventions have on the disease\ntransmission dynamics. The vaccine intervention is rarely selected, except if\nits assumed cost is significantly lower than that predicted in the literature.\nIncreasing the available budget causes the number of person-days of malaria\ninfection to decrease linearly up to a point, after which the benefit of\nincreased budget starts to taper. The optimal policy is highly dependent on\nassumptions about mosquito density, selecting different interventions for wet\nclimates with high density than for dry climates with low density, and the\ninterventions are found to be less effective at controlling malaria in the wet\nclimates when attainable intervention coverage is 60% or lower. However, when\nintervention coverage of 80% is attainable, then malaria prevalence drops\nquickly.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are gapless quasi-topological materials with a set of\nisolated nodal points forming their Fermi surface. They manifest their\nquasi-topological character in a series of topological electromagnetic\nresponses including the anomalous Hall effect. Here we study the effect of\ndisorder on Weyl semimetals while monitoring both their nodal/semi-metallic and\ntopological properties through computations of the localization length and the\nHall conductivity. We examine three different lattice tight-binding models\nwhich realize the Weyl semimetal in part of their phase diagram and look for\nuniversal features that are common to all of the models, and interesting\ndistinguishing features of each model. We present detailed phase diagrams of\nthese models for large system sizes and we find that weak disorder preserves\nthe nodal points up to the diffusive limit, but does affect the Hall\nconductivity. We show that the trend of the Hall conductivity is consistent\nwith an effective picture in which disorder causes the Weyl nodes move within\nthe Brillouin zone along a specific direction that depends deterministically on\nthe properties of the model and the neighboring phases to the Weyl semimetal\nphase. We also uncover an unusual (non-quantized) anomalous Hall insulator\nphase which can only exist in the presence of disorder.\n", "  Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when compared to\nwhat is available today. To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical\nhybrid optimization scheme known as \"the quantum variational eigensolver\" was\ndeveloped with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made\nuseful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend\nthe general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for\npractical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic\nansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from\nsecond order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation\nof exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error\nsuppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this\nalgorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze\ntruncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce\nthe cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative\nfree optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to\nthree orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.\n", "  Recent developments in the search for topological superconductivity have\nbrought lattices of magnetic adatoms on a superconductor into intense focus. In\nthis work we will study ferromagnetic chains of adatoms on superconducting\nsurfaces with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Generalising the deep-impurity\napproach employed extensively in previous works to arbitrary subgap energies,\nwe formulate the theory of the subgap spectrum as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue\nproblem. We obtain an essentially analytical description of the subgap\nspectrum, allowing an efficient study of the topological properties. Employing\na flat-band Hamiltonian sharing the topological properties of the chain, we\nevaluate the $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued winding number and discover five distinct\ntopological phases. Our results also confirm that the topological band\nformation does not require the decoupled Shiba energies to be fine-tuned to the\ngap centre. We also study the properties of Majorana bound states in the\nsystem.\n", "  The radiative neutrino mass model with inert doublet dark matter is a\npromising model for the present experimental issues which cannot be explained\nwithin the standard model. We study an extension of this model focusing on\ncosmological features brought about from the scalar sector. Inflation due to\nsinglet scalars with hierarchical non-minimal couplings with the Ricci scalar\nmay give a favorable solution for both neutrino masses and baryon number\nasymmetry in the Universe.\n", "  We demonstrate a broadband, polarization independent, omnidirectional\nabsorber based on a metallic metasurface architecture, which accomplishes\ngreater than 90% absorptance in the visible and near-infrared range of the\nsolar spectrum, and exhibits low emissivity at mid- and far-infrared\nwavelengths. The complex unit cell of the metasurface solar absorber consists\nof eight pairs of gold nano-resonators that are separated from a gold ground\nplane by a thin silicon dioxide spacer. Our experimental measurements reveal\nhigh-performance absorption over a wide range of incidence angles for both s-\nand p-polarizations. We also investigate numerically the frequency-dependent\nfield and current distributions to elucidate how the absorption occurs within\nthe metasurface structure. Furthermore, we discuss the potential use of our\nmetasurface absorber design in solar thermophotovoltaics by exploiting\nrefractory plasmonic materials.\n", "  Interstellar abundance determinations from fits to X-ray absorption edges\noften rely on the incorrect assumption that scattering is insignificant and can\nbe ignored. We show instead that scattering contributes significantly to the\nattenuation of X-rays for realistic dust grain size distributions and\nsubstantially modifies the spectrum near absorption edges of elements present\nin grains. The dust attenuation modules used in major X-ray spectral fitting\nprograms do not take this into account. We show that the consequences of\nneglecting scattering on the determination of interstellar elemental abundances\nare modest; however, scattering (along with uncertainties in the grain size\ndistribution) must be taken into account when near-edge extinction fine\nstructure is used to infer dust mineralogy. We advertise the benefits and\naccuracy of anomalous diffraction theory for both X-ray halo analysis and near\nedge absorption studies. An open source Fortran suite, General Geometry\nAnomalous Diffraction Theory (GGADT), is presented that calculates X-ray\nabsorption, scattering, and differential scattering cross sections for grains\nof arbitrary geometry and composition.\n", "  The quantum genesis of Hawking radiation is a long-standing puzzle in black\nhole physics. Semi-classically one can argue that the spectrum of radiation\nemitted by a black hole look very much sparse unlike what is expected from a\nthermal object. It was demonstrated through a simple quantum model that a\nquantum black hole will retain a discrete profile, at least in the weak energy\nregime. However, it was suggested that this discreteness might be an artifact\nof the simplicity of eigen-spectrum of the model considered. Different quantum\ntheories can, in principle, give rise to different complicated spectra and make\nthe radiation from black hole dense enough in transition lines, to make them\nlook continuous in profile. We show that such a hope from a geometry-quantized\nblack hole is not realized as long as large enough black holes are dubbed with\na classical mass area relation in any gravity theory ranging from GR,\nLanczos-Lovelock to f(R) gravity. We show that the smallest frequency of\nemission from black hole in any quantum description, is bounded from below, to\nbe of the order of its inverse mass. That leaves the emission with only two\npossibilities. It can either be non-thermal, or it can be thermal only with the\ntemperature being much larger than 1/M.\n", "  By incorporating the nonempirical SCAN semilocal density functional [Sun,\nRuzsinszky, and Perdew, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 036402 (2015)] in the underlying\nexpression of four existing hybrid and double-hybrid models, we propose one\nhybrid (SCAN0) and three double-hybrid (SCAN0-DH, SCAN-QIDH, and SCAN0-2)\ndensity functionals, which are free from any fitted parameters. The SCAN-based\ndouble-hybrid functionals consistently outperform their parent SCAN semilocal\nfunctional for self-interaction problems and noncovalent interactions. In\nparticular, SCAN0-2, which includes about 79% of Hartree-Fock exchange and 50%\nof second-order Moller-Plesset correlation, is shown to be reliably accurate\nfor a very diverse range of applications, such as thermochemistry, kinetics,\nnoncovalent interactions, and self-interaction problems.\n", "  A stochastic second-order wave model is applied to assess the statistical\nproperties of wave orbital velocity in random sea states below the water\nsurface. Directional spreading effects as well as the dependency of the water\ndepth are investigated by means of a Monte-Carlo approach. Unlike for the\nsurface elevation, sub-harmonics dominate the second-order contribution to\norbital velocity. We show that a notable set-down occurs for the most energetic\nand steepest groups. This engenders a negative skewness in the temporal\nevolution of the orbital velocity. A substantial deviation of the upper and\nlower tails of the probability density function from the Gaussian distribution\nis noticed, velocities are faster below the wave trough and slower below the\nwave crest when compared with linear theory predictions. Second-order\nnonlinearity effects strengthen with reducing the water depth, while weaken\nwith the broadening of the wave spectrum. The results are confirmed by\nlaboratory data. Corresponding experiments have been conducted in a large wave\nbasin taking into account the directionality of the wave field. As shown,\nlaboratory data are in very good agreement with the numerical prediction.\n", "  We present a comparative ab initio study of Li, Na, and Mg storage in tin,\nincluding phononic effects and phase competition between alpha and beta Sn. Mg\ndoping at low concentration is found to stabilize the beta phase. On the\ncontrary, Li and Na doping is shown to reverse the stability of the phases at\nroom temperature: Li/Na-doped alpha-Sn is more stable than Li/Na-doped beta-Sn\nup to a temperature of around 380/400 K. This may rationalize the formation of\nalpha-Sn upon lithiation and delithiation of beta-Sn anodes reported in\nexperimental studies. The changes in phase stability with Li/Na/Mg doping are\ndirectly related to the intercalation energies of Li/Na/Mg in one phase versus\nthe other: at 300 K, Li/Na is easier intercalated in alpha-Sn (-0.37/-0.08 eV)\nthan in beta-Sn (0.06/0.49 eV), while Mg intercalation energy is, although\npositive (i.e. unfavored intercalation), lower in beta-Sn (0.53 eV) than in\nalpha-Sn (0.66 eV). The temperature effect is found to affect significantly the\nintercalation energy, by up to 0.13 eV at 300 K. Analysis of diffusion barriers\nshows that Li, Na, and Mg diffusion in beta-Sn is anisotropic with migration\nbarriers along the (001) direction (respectively 0.01, 0.22, and 0.07 eV)\nsignificantly lower than those in alpha-Sn (respectively 0.20, 0.52, and 0.40\neV).\n", "  Majority of theoretical results regarding turbulent mixing are based on the\nmodel of ideal flows with zero correlation time. We discuss the reasons why\nsuch results may fail for real flows and develop a scheme which makes it\npossible to match real flows to ideal flows. In particular we introduce the\nconcept of mixing dimension of flows which can take fractional values. For real\nincompressible flows, the mixing dimension exceeds the topological dimension;\nthis leads to a local inhomogeneity of mixing --- a phenomenon which is not\nobserved for ideal flows and has profound implications, for instance impacting\nthe rate of bimolecular reactions in turbulent flows. Finally, we build a model\nof compressible flows which reproduces the anomalous Lyapunov exponent values\nobserved for time-correlated flows by Boffetta et al (2004), and provide a\nqualitative explanation of this phenomenon.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction\nbetween magnetic impurities that is mediated by the Weyl fermions embedded\ninside a three-dimensional Weyl semimetal (WSM). The WSM is characterized by a\npair of Weyl points separated in the momentum space. Using the Green's function\nmethod and a two-band model, we show that four terms contribute to the magnetic\nimpurity interaction in the WSM phase: the Heisenberg, Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya,\nspin-frustrated and Ising terms. Except the last term which is vanishingly\nsmall in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting two Weyl points, all\nthe other interaction terms are finite. Furthermore, the magnetic spins of the\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya and spin-frustrated terms lie in the plane perpendicular\nto the line connecting two Weyl points, but in this plane, the magnetic spins\nof the Ising term have no components. For each contribution, an analytical\nexpression is obtained, falling off with a spatial dependence as $R^{-5}$ at\nWeyl points and showing beating behavior that depends on the direction between\ntwo magnetic impurities.\n", "  I extend and update earlier work, summarised in [1], whereby the invariant\npolarisation-tensor field (ITF) for deuterons in storage rings was introduced\nto complement the invariant spin field (ISF). Taken together, the ITF and the\nISF provide a definition of the equilibrium spin density-matrix field which, in\nturn, offers a clean framework for describing equilibrium spin-1 ensembles in\nstorage rings. I show how to construct the ITF by stroboscopic averaging, I\ngive examples, I discuss adiabatic invariance and I introduce a formalism for\ndescribing the effect of noise and damping.\n", "  We calculate and analyze Feshbach resonance spectra for ultracold\nYb($^1$S$_0$) + Yb($^3$P$_2$) collisions as a function of an interatomic\npotential scaling factor $\\lambda$ and external magnetic field. We show that,\nat zero field, the resonances are distributed randomly in $\\lambda$, but that\nsignatures of quantum chaos emerge as a field is applied. The random zero-field\ndistribution arises from superposition of structured spectra associated with\nindividual total angular momenta. In addition, we show that the resonances in\nmagnetic field in the experimentally accessible range 400 to 2000~G are\nchaotically distributed, with strong level repulsion that is characteristic of\nquantum chaos.\n", "  Micropatterning techniques have become an important tool for the study of\ncell behavior in controlled microenvironments. As a consequence, several\napproaches for the creation of micropatterns have been developed in recent\nyears. However, the diversity of substrates, coatings and complex patterns used\nin cell science is so great that no single existing technique is capable of\nfabricating designs suitable for all experimental conditions. Hence, there is a\nneed for patterning protocols that are flexible with regard to the materials\nused and compatible with different patterning strategies to create more\nelaborate setups. In this work, we present a versatile approach to\nmicropatterning. The protocol is based on plasma treatment, protein coating,\nand a PLL-PEG backfill step, and produces homogeneous patterns on a variety of\nsubstrates. Protein density within the patterns can be controlled, and density\ngradients of surface-bound protein can be formed. Moreover, by combining the\nmethod with microcontact printing, it is possible to generate patterns composed\nof three different components within one iteration of the protocol. The\ntechnique is simple to implement and should enable cell science labs to create\na broad range of complex and highly specialized microenvironments.\n", "  I summarise a method to quantitatively assess the consistency of\npower-counting proposals in Effective Field Theories which are non-perturbative\nat leading order. It uses the fact that the Renormalisation Group evolution of\nan observable predicts the functional form of its residual cutoff dependence on\nthe EFT breakdown scale, low-momentum scales, and the order of the calculation.\nPassing this test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a\nsuggested power counting whose exact nature is disputed. For example, in ChiEFT\nwith more than one nucleon, a lack of universally accepted analytic solutions\nobfuscates the relation between convergence pattern and numerical results, and\nled to proposals which predict different numbers of Low Energy Coefficients at\nthe same chiral order. The method may provide an independent check whether an\nobservable is renormalised at a given order, and of both the breakdown scale\nand the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence pattern of an EFT.\nConversely, it may help identify LECs which produce renormalised observables at\na given order. I also discuss its underlying assumptions and relation to the RG\nEquation; useful choices for observables and cutoffs; the momentum window in\nwhich the test provides best signals; its dependence on the values and forms of\ncutoffs as well as on the EFT parameters; the impact of fitting Low Energy\nCoefficients to data in different or the same channel; caveats and limitations.\nSince the test is designed to minimise the use of data, it allows one to\nquantitatively falsify if the EFT has been renormalised consistently, rather\nthan quantifying how an EFT compares to experiment. Its application in\nparticular to the 3P0 and 3P2-3F2 partial waves of NN scattering in ChiEFT may\nelucidate persistent power-counting issues. Details and a better bibliography\ncan be found in an upcoming publication.\n", "  We perform for the first time high-resolution zoom-in re-simulations of\nindividual halos in the context of the Multi-coupled Dark Energy (McDE)\nscenario, which is characterised by the existence of two distinct dark matter\nparticle species with opposite couplings to a Dark Energy scalar field. We\ncompare the structural properties of the simulated halos to the standard\nLambda-CDM results. The zoomed-in initial conditions are set up using a\nspecifically designed code called ZInCo that we publicly release along with the\npresent paper. Our numerical results allow to investigate in detail and with\nunprecedented resolution the halo segregation process that characterises McDE\ncosmologies from its very early stages. In particular, we find that in contrast\nto what could be inferred from previous numerical analysis at lower resolution,\nthe segregation process is already in place at redshifts as high as z ~ 7. Most\nremarkably, we find that the subsequent evolution of the segregation leads to\nthe formation of cored total matter density profiles with a core size that\nprogressively increases in time. The shape of the cored profiles can be\naccurately predicted as the superposition of two NFW profiles with an\nincreasing offset, thereby confirming the interpretation of the simulations\nresults in terms of the segregation of the two dark matter components of the\nhalo as a consequence of their different coupling to the Dark Energy field.\n", "  We analyze the operation of a novel sensor based on atom interferometry,\nwhich can achieve supra-classical sensitivity by exploiting quantum\ncorrelations in mixed states of many qubits. The interferometer is based on\nquantum gates which use coherently-controlled Rydberg interactions between a\nsingle atom (which acts as a control qubit) and an atomic ensemble (which\nprovides register qubits). In principle, our scheme can achieve precision\nscaling with the size of the ensemble - which can extend to large numbers of\natoms - while using only single-qubit operations on the control and bulk\noperations on the ensemble. We investigate realistic implementation of the\ninterferometer, and our main aim is to develop a new approach to quantum\nmetrology that can achieve quantum-enhanced measurement precision by exploiting\ncoherent operations on large impure quantum states. We propose an experiment to\ndemonstrate the enhanced sensitivity of the protocol, and to investigate a\ntransition from classical to supra-classical sensitivity which occurs when\nusing highly-mixed probe states.\n", "  We calculate entanglement and impurity entropies in a recent holographic\nmodel of a magnetic impurity interacting with a strongly coupled system. There\nis an RG flow to an IR fixed point where the impurity is screened, leading to a\ndecrease in impurity degrees of freedom. This information loss corresponds to a\nvolume decrease in our dual gravity model, which consists of a codimension one\nhypersurface embedded in a BTZ black hole background in three dimensions. There\nare matter fields defined on this hypersurface which are dual to Kondo field\ntheory operators. In the large N limit, the formation of the Kondo cloud\ncorresponds to the condensation of a scalar field. The entropy is calculated\naccording to the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription. This requires to determine the\nbackreaction of the hypersurface on the BTZ geometry, which is achieved by\nsolving the Israel junction conditions. We find that the larger the scalar\ncondensate gets, the more the volume of constant time slices in the bulk is\nreduced, shortening the bulk geodesics and reducing the impurity entropy. This\nprovides a new non-trivial example of an RG flow satisfying the g-theorem.\nMoreover, we find explicit expressions for the impurity entropy which are in\nagreement with previous field theory results for free electrons. This\ndemonstrates the universality of perturbing about an IR fixed point.\n", "  The hexagonal RMnO$_3$ (h-RMnO$_3$) are multiferroic materials, which exhibit\nthe coexistence of a magnetic order and ferroelectricity. Their distinction is\nin their geometry that both results in an unusual mechanism to break inversion\nsymmetry, and also produces a 2D triangular lattice of Mn spins, which is\nsubject to geometrical magnetic frustration due to the antiferromagnetic\ninteractions between nearest neighbour Mn ions. This unique combination makes\nthe h-RMnO$_3$ a model system to test ideas of spin-lattice coupling,\nparticularly when the both the improper ferroelectricity and the Mn\ntrimerisation that appears to determine the symmetry of the magnetic structure\narise from the same structure distortion. In this review, we demonstrate how\nthe use of both neutron and X-ray diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering\ntechniques have been essential to paint this comprehensive and coherent picture\nof the h-RMnO$_3$.\n", "  We present the amounts of information, fidelity, and reversibility obtained\nby arbitrary quantum measurements on completely unknown states. These\nquantities are expressed as functions of the singular values of a measurement\noperator corresponding to the obtained outcome. As an example, we consider a\nclass of quantum measurements with highly degenerate singular values to discuss\ntradeoffs among information, fidelity, and reversibility. The tradeoffs are at\nthe level of a single outcome, in the sense that the quantities pertain to each\nsingle outcome rather than the average over all possible outcomes.\n", "  High-Q silicon nitride (SiN) microresonators enable optical Kerr frequency\ncomb generation on a photonic chip and have recently been shown to support\nfully coherent combs based on temporal dissipative Kerr soliton formation. For\nbright soliton formation it is necessary to operate SiN waveguides in the\nmultimode regime so as to produce anomalous group velocity dispersion. This can\nlead to local disturbances of the dispersion due to avoided crossings caused by\ncoupling between different mode families, and therefore prevent the soliton\nformation. Here we demonstrate that a single mode \"filtering\" section inside\nhigh-Q resonators enables to efficiently suppress avoided crossings, while\npreserving high quality factors (Q~10^6). We demonstrate the approach by single\nsoliton formation in SiN resonators with filtering section.\n", "  In this contribution, we outline a new 2-phase description of the\nquark-nuclear matter hybrid equation of state that takes into account effects\nof phase space occupation (excluded volume) in both, the hadronic and the quark\nmatter phases. For the nuclear matter phase, the reduction of the available\nvolume at increasing density leads to a stiffening, while for the quark matter\nphase a reduction of the effective string tension in the confining density\nfunctional is obtained. The deconfinement phase transition in the resulting\nhybrid equation of state is sensitive to both excluded volume effects. As an\napplication, we consider matter under compact star constraints of electric\nneutrality and $\\beta$-equilibrium. We obtain mass-radius relations for hybrid\nstars that fulfill the $2M_\\odot$ constraint and exhibit the high-mass twin\nphenomenon. Both features depend sensitively on the excluded volume.\n", "  We suggest a new Bayesian analysis (BA) using disjunct M-R constraints for\nextracting probability measures for cold, dense matter equations of state\n(EoS). One of the key issues of such an analysis is the question of a\ndeconfinement transition in compact stars and whether it proceeds as a\ncrossover or rather as a first order transition. We show by postulating results\nof not yet existing radius measurements for the known pulsars with a mass of\n$2M_\\odot$ that a radius gap of about 3 km would clearly select an EoS with a\nstrong first order phase transition as the most probably one. This would\nsupport the existence of a critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram under\nscrutiny in present and upcoming heavy-ion collision experiments.\n", "  We study the cross section for vector boson ($W^{\\pm}/Z^0/\\gamma^*$)\nproduction in polarized nucleon-nucleon collisions for low transverse momentum\nof the observed vector boson. For the case where one measures the transverse\nmomentum and azimuthal angle of the vector bosons, we present the cross\nsections and the associated spin asymmetries in terms of transverse momentum\ndependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) at tree level within the TMD\nfactorization formalism. To assess the feasibility of experimental\nmeasurements, we estimate the spin asymmetries for $W^{\\pm}/Z^0$ boson\nproduction in polarized proton-proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC) by using current knowledge of the relevant TMDs. We find that\nsome of these asymmetries can be sizable if the suppression effect from TMD\nevolution is not too strong. The $W$ program at RHIC can, thus, test and\nconstrain spin theory by providing unique information on the universality\nproperties of TMDs, TMD evolution, and the nucleon structure. For example, the\nsingle transverse spin asymmetries could be used to probe the well-known Sivers\nfunction $f_{1T}^{\\perp q}$, as well as the transversal helicity distribution\n$g_{1T}^{q}$ via the parity-violating nature of $W$ production.\n", "  We analyze the optomechanics of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate\ninteracting with the optical lattice inside a laser-pumped optical cavity and\nsubject to a uniform bias force such as gravity. An atomic wave packet in a\ntilted lattice undergoes Bloch oscillations; in a cavity the backaction of the\natoms on the light leads to a time-dependent modulation of the intracavity\nlattice at the Bloch frequency. When the Bloch frequency is on the order of the\ncavity damping rate we find transport of the atoms either up or down the\nlattice. The transport dynamics can be interpreted as a manifestation of\ndynamical backaction-induced sideband damping/amplification of the\noptomechanical Bloch oscillator. Depending on the sign of the pump-cavity\ndetuning, atoms are transported either with or against the bias force\naccompanied by an up- or down-conversion of the frequency of the pump laser\nlight. We also evaluate the prospects for using the optomechanical Bloch\noscillator to make continuous measurements of forces by reading out the Bloch\nfrequency. In this context we establish the significant result that the optical\nspring effect is absent and the Bloch frequency is not modified by the\nbackaction.\n", "  We show that the recent anomalies in $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ transitions\nobserved by the LHCb collaboration can be accommodated within string motivated\nmodels with a low mass $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge boson. Such $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge boson\ncan be obtained in compactifications with a low string scale. We consider a\nclass of intersecting D-brane models, in which different families of quarks and\nleptons are simultaneously realized at different D-brane intersections. The\nexplanation of $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ anomalies via a stringy $Z^{\\prime}$\nsets important restrictions on these viable D-brane constructions.\n", "  Humankind has long endeavored to control the propagation direction of light.\nSince time immemorial, shades, lenses and mirrors have been used to control the\nflow of light. In modern society, with the rapid development of nanotechnology,\nthe control of light is moving toward devices at micrometer and even nanometer\nscales. At such scales, traditional devices based on geometrical optics reach\ntheir fundamental direction limits and cease to work. Nano photonics, on the\nother hand, has attracted wide attention from researchers, especially in the\nlast decade, due to its ability to manipulate light at the nanoscale. This\nreview focuses on the nano photonics systems that aim to select light based on\nits propagation direction. In the first half of this review, we survey the\nliterature and the current state of the art focused on enabling optical\nbroadband angular selectivity. The mechanisms we review can be classified into\nthree main categories: (i) microscale geometrical optics, (ii) multilayer\nbirefringent materials and (iii) Brewster modes in plasmonic systems, photonic\ncrystals and metamaterials. In the second half, we present two categories of\npotential applications for broadband angularly selective systems. The first\ncategory aims at enhancing the efficiency of solar energy harvesting, through\nphotovoltaic process or solar thermal process. The second category aims at\nenhancing light extracting efficiency and detection sensitivity. Finally, we\ndiscuss the most prominent challenges in broadband angular selectivity and some\nprospects on how to solve these challenges.\n", "  In this letter, by the use of the generalized effective potential theory,\nwith the help of process-chain approach under the framework of Kato formulation\nof perturbation expansion, we calculate out the quantum phase diagram up to\n8-th order for an ultracold Bose system in a square optical superlattice. Base\non these perturbative data, with the help of the linear fit extrapolation\ntechnique, more accurate results are gotten, which are in excellent agreement\nwith recent Monte-Carlo numerical results. Moreover, by employing the\ngeneralized re-summed Green's function method and cumulant expansion, the\nmomentum distribution function of the system is also calculated analytically\nand the time-of-flight absorption pictures of the system are plotted.\n", "  Self-induced transparency mode-locking (or coherent mode-locking, CML) which\nis based on intracavity self-induced transparency soliton dynamics, allows\npotentially to achieve nearly single cycle intracavity pulse durations, much\nbelow the phase relaxation time $T_2$ in a laser, which, despite of great\npromise, has not yet been realized experimentally. We develop a diagram\ntechnique which allows to predict the main features of CML regimes in a generic\ntwo-section laser. We show that CML can arise directly at the first laser\nthreshold if the phase relaxation time is large enough. Furthermore, CML\nregimes can be unconditionally stable. We also predict the existence of\n``super-CML regimes``, with a pulse coupled to several Rabi oscillations in the\nnonlinear medium.\n", "  We question the microcanonical hypothesis, often made to account for the\nthermalization of complex closed quantum systems, on the specific example of a\nchain of two-level atoms optically driven by a resonant laser beam and strongly\ninteracting via Rydberg-Rydberg dipole-dipole interactions. Along its\n(necessarily unitary) evolution, this system is indeed expected to thermalize,\ni.e. observables, such as the number of excitations, stop oscillating and reach\nequilibrium-like expectation values. The latter are often calculated through\nassuming the system can be effectively described by a thermal-like\nmicrocanonical state. Here, we compare the distribution of excitations in the\nchain calculated either according to the microcanonical assumption or through\ndirect exact numerical simulation. This allows us to show the limitations of\nthe thermal equilibrium hypothesis and precise its applicability conditions.\n", "  Electronic topological insulators are one of the breakthroughs of the 21st\ncentury condensed matter physics. So far, the search for a light counterpart of\nan electronic topological insulator has remained elusive. This is due to the\nfundamentally different natures of light and matter and the different spins of\nphotons and electrons. Here, it is shown that the theory of electronic\ntopological insulators has a genuine analogue in the context of light wave\npropagation in time-reversal invariant continuous materials. We introduce a\nGauge invariant $Z_2$ index that depends on the global properties of the\nphotonic band structure and is robust to any continuous weak variation of the\nmaterial parameters that preserves the time-reversal invariance. A nontrivial\n$Z_2$ index has two possible causes: (i) the lack of smoothness of the\npseudo-Hamiltonian in the ${\\bf{k}} \\to \\infty$ limit, and (ii) the\nentanglement between positive and negative frequency eigenmode branches. In\nparticular, it is proven that electric-type plasmas and magnetic-type plasmas\nare topologically inequivalent for a fixed wave polarization. We propose a\nbulk-edge correspondence that links the number of edge modes with the\ntopological invariants of two continuous bulk materials, and present detailed\nnumerical examples that illustrate the application of the theory.\n", "  We present a resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of spin and\ncharge excitations in overdoped La1.77Sr0.23CuO4 along two high-symmetry\ndirections. The line shape of these excitations is analyzed and they are shown\nto be highly overdamped. Their spectral weight and damping are found to be\nstrongly momentum dependent. Qualitative agreement between these observations\nand a calculated RPA susceptibility is obtained for this overdoped compound,\nimplying that a significant contribution to the RIXS signal stems from a\ncontinuum of charge excitations. Furthermore, this suggests that the\nspin-excitations in the overdoped regime can be captured qualitatively by an\nitinerant picture. Our calculations also predict a new low-energy spin\nexcitation branch to exist along the nodal direction near the zone center. With\nthe energy resolution of the present experiment, this branch is not resolvable\nbut we show that next generation of high-resolution spectrometers will be able\nto test this prediction.\n", "  The impact parameter dependence of \\rpi ratio is examined in heavy-ion\ncollisions at 400MeV/nucleon within a transport model. It is shown that the\nsensitivity of \\rpi ratio on symmetry energy shows a transition from central to\nperipheral collisions, i.e., the stiffer symmetry energy leads to a larger \\rpi\nratio in peripheral collisions while the softer symmetry energy always leads\nthis ratio to be larger in central collisions. After checking the kinematic\nenergy distribution of \\rpi ratio, we found this transition of sensitivity of\n\\rpi ratio to symmetry energy is mainly from less energetic pions, i.e., the\nsofter symmetry energy gets the less energetic pions to form a smaller \\rpi\nratio in peripheral collisions while these pions generate a larger \\rpi ratio\nin central collisions. Undoubtedly, the softer symmetry energy can also lead\nmore energetic pions to form a larger \\rpi ratio in peripheral collisions.\nNevertheless, considering that most of pions are insufficient energetic at this\nbeam energy, we therefore suggest the \\rpi ratio as a probe of the high-density\nsymmetry energy effective only in central at most to midcentral collisions,\nthereby avoiding the possible information of low-density symmetry energy\ncarried in \\rpi ratio from peripheral collisions.\n", "  In protoplanetary disks, CO$_2$ is solid ice beyond its snow line at $\\sim 10\n\\rm AU$. Due to its high abundance, it contributes heavily to the collisional\nevolution in this region of the disk. For the first time, we carried out\nlaboratory collision experiments with CO$_2$ ice particles and a CO$_2$-covered\nwall at a temperature of 80 K. Collision velocities varied between 0 - 2.5 m/s.\nParticle sizes were on the order of $\\sim$ 100 $\\mu$m. We find a threshold\nvelocity between the sticking and the bouncing regime at 0.04 m/s. Particles\nwith greater velocities but below 1 m/s bounce off the wall. For yet greater\nvelocities, fragmentation occurs. We give analytical models for the\ncoefficients of restitution and fragmentation strength consistent with the\nexperimental data. Set in context, our data show that CO$_2$ ice and silicate\ndust resemble each other in the collisional behavior. Compared to water ice the\nsticking velocity is an order of magnitude smaller. One immediate consequence\nas example is that water ice particles mantled by CO$_2$ ice lose any \"sticking\nadvantage.\" In this case, preferential planetesimal growth attributed to the\nsticking properties of water ice will be limited to the region between the\nH$_2$O ice line and the CO$_2$ ice line.\n", "  Alternative top quark mass determinations can provide inputs to the world\naverage with orthogonal systematic uncertainties and may help to refine the\ninterpretation of the standard method. Among a number of recent results I focus\non the extractions by ATLAS and CMS of the top quark pole mass from the top\nquark pair and tt + 1 jet production cross-section, which have now reached a\nprecision of 1%.\n", "  Magnetic properties of La2-xSrxCoO4 have been modelled using McPhase for\ndifferent doping levels x. Footprints of different interactions, such as local\nsingle ion anisotropy and variations in the exchange interactions have been\nidentified in the profile of the diffuse elastic neutron scattering cross\nsection. The role of quantum fluctuations in the formation of the hourglass\nspectrum is discussed.\n", "  The Cauchy problem for first-order PDE with the initial data which have a\npiecewise discontinuities localized in different spatial points is completely\nsolved. The interactions between discontinuities arising after breakup of\ninitial discontinuities are studied with the help of the hodograph method. The\nsolution is constructed in analytical implicit form. To recovery the explicit\nform of solution we propose the transformation of the PDEs into some ODEs on\nthe level lines (isochrones) of implicit solution. In particular, this method\nallows us to solve the Goursat problem with initial data on characteristics.\nThe paper describes a specific problem for zone electrophoresis (method of the\nmixture separation). However, the method proposed allows to solve any system of\ntwo first-order quasilinear PDEs for which the second order linear PDE, arising\nafter the hodograph transformation, has the Riemann-Green function in explicit\nform.\n", "  Fine questions our interpretation of unidirectional-stripes over\nbidirectional-checkerboard, and illustrates his criticism by simulating a\nmomentum space structure consistent with our data and corresponding to a\ncheckerboard-looking real space density. Here we use a local\nrotational-symmetry analysis to demonstrate that the simulated image is in\nactuality composed of locally unidirectional modulations of the charge density,\nconsistent with our original conclusions.\n", "  The nature of dark matter, dark energy and large-scale gravity pose some of\nthe most pressing questions in cosmology today. These fundamental questions\nrequire highly precise measurements, and a number of wide-field spectroscopic\nsurvey instruments are being designed to meet this requirement. A key component\nin these experiments is the development of a simulation tool to forecast\nscience performance, define requirement flow-downs, optimize implementation,\ndemonstrate feasibility, and prepare for exploitation. We present SPOKES\n(SPectrOscopic KEn Simulation), an end-to-end simulation facility for\nspectroscopic cosmological surveys designed to address this challenge. SPOKES\nis based on an integrated infrastructure, modular function organization,\ncoherent data handling and fast data access. These key features allow\nreproducibility of pipeline runs, enable ease of use and provide flexibility to\nupdate functions within the pipeline. The cyclic nature of the pipeline offers\nthe possibility to make the science output an efficient measure for design\noptimization and feasibility testing. We present the architecture, first\nscience, and computational performance results of the simulation pipeline. The\nframework is general, but for the benchmark tests, we use the Dark Energy\nSpectrometer (DESpec), one of the early concepts for the upcoming project, the\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We discuss how the SPOKES\nframework enables a rigorous process to optimize and exploit spectroscopic\nsurvey experiments in order to derive high-precision cosmological measurements\noptimally.\n", "  In this paper, we formulate a regular $q$-fractional Sturm--Liouville problem\n(qFSLP) which includes the left-sided Riemann--Liouville and the right-sided\nCaputo $q$-fractional derivatives of the same order $\\alpha$, $\\alpha\\in\n(0,1)$. We introduce the essential $q$-fractional variational analysis needed\nin proving the existence of a countable set of real eigenvalues and associated\northogonal eigenfunctions for the regular qFSLP when $\\alpha>1/2$ associated\nwith the boundary condition $y(0)=y(a)=0$. A criteria for the first eigenvalue\nis proved. Examples are included. These results are a generalization of the\ninteger regular $q$-Sturm--Liouville problem introduced by Annaby and Mansour\nin [1].\n", "  The CERN LHC delivered 25/fb of proton-proton collision data in 2011-2012 at\nsqrt{s} = 7 - 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy to the ATLAS detector. These Run 1\ndata were used to discover the Higgs boson and measure its properties as well\nas to perform numerous other tests of the Standard Model via precision\nmeasurements and searches for New Physics. In preparation for the Run 2 data\ntaking at sqrt{s} = 13 TeV, the collaboration embarked on an upgrade program\nduring the long LHC machine shutdown in 2013-2015. The early 2015 data set was\nthen used to promptly recommission the apparatus allowing the first physics\nresults to appear already in the summer of 2015. After briefly reviewing the\nupgrade and the improved performance of the detector, this paper concentrates\non the final Run~1 results on Higgs, W and Z boson, electroweak multi-boson and\ntop quark production as well as on searches for supersymmetry and other new\nphenomena.\n", "  In this work, we calculate material gain for long wavelength III-nitride InN\nand AlInN quantum dot (QD) structures. Strain and QD inhomogeneity are included\nin the calculations. The study covers (800-2300 nm) wavelength range which is\nimportant in optical communications. While p-doping is shown to be efficient to\nincreasing gain, changing QD size (especially QD radius) is more efficient to\nvary wavelength. The results predicted that n-doped QD structures are promises\nfor broad band laser applications.\n", "  Performing active quantum error correction to protect fragile quantum states\nhighly depends on the correctness of error information--error syndromes. To\nobtain reliable error syndromes using imperfect physical circuits, we propose\nthe idea of quantum data-syndrome (DS) codes that are capable of correcting\nboth data qubits and syndrome bits errors. We study fundamental properties of\nquantum DS codes and provide several CSS-type code constructions of quantum DS\ncodes.\n", "  Four wave mixing analysis is stated for quantum dot semiconductor optical\namplifiers (QD SOAs) using the propagation equations (including nonlinear\npropagation contribution) coupled with the QD rate equations under the\nsaturation assumption. Long wavelength III-nitride InN and AlInN QD SOAs are\nsimulated. Asymmetric behavior due to linewidth enhancement factor is assigned.\nP-doping increases efficiency. Lossless efficiency for InAlN QDs for longer\nradii is obtained. Carrier heating is shown to have a considerable effect and a\ndetuning dependence is expected at most cases. InN QD SOAs shown to have higher\nefficiency.\n", "  We present light curve solutions of the W UMa-type eclipsing binary\nOGLE-GD-ECL-04451, observed by both the \\emph{Optical Gravitational Lensing\nEx-periment} (\\emph{OGLE}) program in 2006 and the \\emph{Antarctica Survey\nTelescope} (\\emph{AST3-1}) in 2012 at Dome A. We analyzed this binary system\nwith the Wilson-Devinney(W-D) method 2013 version and derived the mass ratio\n$q=2.91 \\pm 0.07$, the inclination $i=76.86^\\circ \\pm 0.23^\\circ$, and the\nlight variattion amplitud was $0^m.51$ based on the \\emph{OGLE} data. From the\n\\emph{AST3-1}'s data, we find that the amplitude dropped to $0^m.44$(2012) and\nthe difference of magnitudes of the two light maxima is $0^m.03$. A hot spot\nwas then added on the surface of the secondary to demonstrate the amplitude\nchange and O'Conell effect of the binary system.\n", "  Cavity electro-(opto-)mechanics allows us to access not only single isolated\nbut also multiple mechanical modes in a massive object. Here we develop a\nmulti-mode electromechanical system in which a several membrane vibrational\nmodes are coupled to a three-dimensional loop-gap superconducting microwave\ncavity. The tight confinement of the electric field across a\nmechanically-compliant narrow-gap capacitor brings the system into the quantum\nstrong coupling regime under a red-sideband pump field. We demonstrate strong\ncoupling between two mechanical modes, which is induced by two-tone parametric\ndrives and mediated by a virtual photon in the cavity. The tunable\ninter-mechanical-mode coupling can be used to generate entanglement between the\nmechanical modes.\n", "  Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT), a layered ferromagnetic insulator, has attracted a great\ndeal of interest recently owing to its potential for integration with Dirac\nmaterials to realize the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and to develop\nnovel spintronics devices. Here, we study the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy\nenergy of single-crystalline CGT and determine that the magnetic easy axis is\ndirected along the c-axis in its ferromagnetic phase. In addition, CGT is an\ninsulator below the Curie temperature. These properties make CGT a potentially\npromising candidate substrate for integration with topological insulators for\nthe realization of the high-temperature QAHE.\n", "  In this paper we study CdS/CdTe solar cells by means of AMPS-1D software.\nFirst we study the effect of thickness of semiconductor layers on the output\nparameters of the CdS/CdTe solar cell, such as density of short-circuit\ncurrent, open circuit voltage, fill factor and efficiency. Numerical simulation\nshows that the highest efficiency of single-junction CdS/CdTe solar cell equal\nto 18.3% is achieved when the CdTe layer thickness is 1000 nm and a CdS layer\nis 60 nm. Then, in order to obtain the maximal value of the efficiency, new\ntandem multi-junction structure consisting of layers of two solar cells\nconnected with each other back to back are designed and engineered taking into\naccount the results obtained for the single-junction solar cells. Numerical\nsimulations show that its highest efficiency in 31.8% can be obtained when the\nthickness of CdS p-layer is equal to 50 nm, and the thickness of the CdS\nn-layer is equal to 200 nm, while thicknesses of the CdTe n-layer and CdTe\np-layer are kept fixed and equal to 3000 nm and 1000 nm, respectively.\n", "  Instabilities are common phenomena frequently observed in nature, sometimes\nleading to unexpected catastrophes and disasters in seemingly normal\nconditions. The simplest form of instability in a distributed system is its\nresponse to a harmonic modulation. Such instability has special names in\nvarious branches of physics and is generally known as modulation instability\n(MI). The MI is tightly related to Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) recurrence since\nbreather solutions of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) are known to\naccurately describe growth and decay of modulationally unstable waves in\nconservative systems. Here, we report theoretical, numerical and experimental\nevidence of the effect of dissipation on FPU cycles in a super wave tank,\nnamely their shift in a determined order. In showing that ideal NLSE breather\nsolutions can describe such dissipative nonlinear dynamics, our results may\nimpact the interpretation of a wide range of new physics scenarios.\n", "  NIKA 2 (New Instrument of Kids Array) is a next generation continuum and\npolarized instrument successfully installed in October 2015 at the IRAM 30 m\ntelescope on Pico-Veleta (Granada, Spain). NIKA 2 is a high resolution\ndual-band camera, operating with frequency multiplexed LEKIDs (Lumped Element\nKinetic Inductance Detectors) cooled at 100 mK. Dual color images are obtained\nthanks to the simultaneous readout of a 1020 pixels array at 2 mm and 1140 x 2\npixels arrays at 1.15 mm with a final resolution of 18 and 12 arcsec\nrespectively, and 6.5 arcmin of Field of View (FoV). The two arrays at 1.15 mm\nallow us to measure the linear polarization of the incoming light. This will\nplace NIKA 2 as an instrument of choice to study the role of magnetic fields in\nthe star formation process. The NIKA experiment, a prototype for NIKA 2 with a\nreduced number of detectors (about 400 LEKIDs) and FoV (1.8 arcmin), has been\nsuccessfully operated at the IRAM 30 telescope in several open observational\ncampaigns. The performance of the NIKA 2 polarization setup has been\nsuccessfully validated with the NIKA prototype.\n", "  We investigate the impact of water fluctuations on the key-lock association\nkinetics of a hydrophobic ligand (key) binding to a hydrophobic pocket (lock)\nby means of a minimalistic stochastic model system. It describes the collective\nhydration behavior of the pocket by bimodal fluctuations of a water-pocket\ninterface that dynamically couples to the diffusive motion of the approaching\nligand via the hydrophobic interaction. This leads to a set of overdamped\nLangevin equations in 2D-coordinate-space, that is Markovian in each dimension.\nNumerical simulations demonstrate locally increased friction of the ligand,\ndecelerated binding kinetics, and local non-Markovian (memory) effects in the\nligand's reaction coordinate as found previously in explicit-water molecular\ndynamics studies of model hydrophobic pocket-ligand binding [1,2]. Our\nminimalistic model elucidates the origin of effectively enhanced friction in\nthe process that can be traced back to long-time decays in the\nforce-autocorrelation function induced by the effective, spatially fluctuating\npocket-ligand interaction. Furthermore, we construct a generalized 1D-Langevin\ndescription including a spatially local memory function that enables further\ninterpretation and a semi-analytical quantification of the results of the\ncoupled 2D-system.\n", "  Graphene electrodes are promising candidates to improve reproducibility and\nstability in molecular electronics through new electrode-molecule anchoring\nstrategies. Here we report sequential electron transport in few-layer graphene\ntransistors containing individual curcuminoid-based molecules anchored to the\nelectrodes via pi-pi orbital bonding. We show the coexistence of inelastic\nco-tunneling excitations with single-electron transport physics owing to an\nintermediate molecule-electrode coupling; we argue that an intermediate\nelectron-phonon coupling is the origin of these vibrational-assisted\nexcitations. These experimental observations are complemented with density\nfunctional theory calculations to model electron transport and the interaction\nbetween electrons and vibrational modes of the curcuminoid molecule. We find\nthat the calculated vibrational modes of the molecule are in agreement with the\nexperimentally observed excitations.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the kinematics of the Galactic globular\ncluster NGC 6397 based on more than ~18,000 spectra obtained with the novel\nintegral field spectrograph MUSE. While NGC 6397 is often considered a core\ncollapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness\nprofile at the smallest radii. Although it is among the nearest globular\nclusters, the low velocity dispersion of NGC 6397 of <5km/s imposes heavy\ndemands on the quality of the kinematical data. We show that despite its\nlimited spectral resolution, MUSE reaches an accuracy of 1km/s in the analysis\nof stellar spectra. We find slight evidence for a rotational component in the\ncluster and the velocity dispersion profile that we obtain shows a mild central\ncusp. To investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans\nmodels and compare these models to our kinematical data. This comparison shows\nthat if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed, the addition of an\nintermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 600M_sun brings the model\npredictions into agreement with our data, and therefore could be at the origin\nof the velocity dispersion profile. We further investigate cases with varying\nmass-to-light ratios and find that a compact dark stellar component can also\nexplain our observations. However, such a component would closely resemble the\nblack hole from the constant mass-to-light ratio models as this component must\nbe confined to the central ~5arcsec of the cluster and must have a similar\nmass. Independent constraints on the distribution of stellar remnants in the\ncluster or kinematic measurements at the highest possible spatial resolution\nshould be able to distinguish the two alternatives.\n", "  In modelling of elastic objects in a flow such as red blood cells, white\nblood cells, or tumour cells, several elastic moduli are involved. One of them\nis the area conservation modulus. In this paper, we focus on spring network\nmodels and we introduce a new way of modeling the area preservation modulus. We\ntake into account the current shape of the individual triangles and find the\nproportional allocation of area conservation forces, which would for individual\ntriangles preserve their shapes. The analysis shows that this approach tends to\nregularize the triangulation. We demonstrate this effect on individual\ntriangles as well as on the complete triangulations.\n", "  We propose a procedure for extraction of the Fermi surface for a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas with a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling from\nconductance microscopy. Due to the interplay between the effective spin-orbit\nmagnetic field and the external one within the plane of confinement, the\nbackscattering induced by a charged tip of an atomic force microscope located\nabove the sample, leads to the spin precession, and thus to the spin mixing of\nthe incident and reflected modes. This mixing leads to a characteristic\nangle-dependent beating pattern visible in the conductance maps. We show that\nthe structure of the Fermi level, bearing signatures of the spin-orbit\ncoupling, can be extracted from the Fourier transform of the interference\nfringes in the conductance maps as a function of the magnetic field direction.\nWe propose a simple analytical model which can be used to fit the experimental\ndata in order to obtain the spin-orbit coupling constant.\n", "  We have investigated the unidirectional spin wave heat conveyer effect in\nsub-micron thick yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films using lock-in thermography\n(LIT). Although the effect is small in thin layers this technique allows us to\nobserve asymmetric heat transport by magnons which leads to asymmetric\ntemperature profiles differing by several mK on both sides of the exciting\nantenna, respectively. Comparison of Damon-Eshbach and backward volume modes\nshows that the unidirectional heat flow is indeed due to non-reciprocal\nspin-waves. Because of the finite linewidth, small asymmetries can still be\nobserved when only the uniform mode of ferromagnetic resonance is excited. The\nlatter is of extreme importance for example when measuring the inverse\nspin-Hall effect because the temperature differences can result in\nthermovoltages at the contacts. Because of the non-reciprocity these\nthermovoltages reverse their sign with a reversal of the magnetic field which\nis typically deemed the signature of the inverse spin-Hall voltage.\n", "  We realize and investigate ionic liquid gated field-effect transistors (FETs)\non large-area MoS2 monolayers grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Under\nelectron accumulation, the performance of these devices is comparable to that\nof FETs based on exfoliated flakes. FETs on CVD-grown material, however,\nexhibit clear ambipolar transport, which for MoS2 monolayers had not been\nreported previously. We exploit this property to estimate the bandgap {\\Delta}\nof monolayer MoS2 directly from the device transfer curves and find {\\Delta}\n$\\approx$ 2.4-2.7 eV. In the ambipolar injection regime, we observe\nelectroluminescence due to exciton recombination in MoS2, originating from the\nregion close to the hole-injecting contact. Both the observed transport\nproperties and the behavior of the electroluminescence can be consistently\nunderstood as due to the presence of defect states at an energy of 250-300 meV\nabove the top of the valence band, acting as deep traps for holes. Our results\nare of technological relevance, as they show that devices with useful\noptoelectronic functionality can be realized on large-area MoS2 monolayers\nproduced by controllable and scalable techniques.\n", "  Moon Zoo is a citizen science project that utilises internet crowd-sourcing\ntechniques. Moon Zoo users are asked to review high spatial resolution images\nfrom the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), onboard NASAs LRO\nspacecraft, and perform characterisation such as measuring impact crater sizes\nand identify morphological features of interest. The tasks are designed to\naddress issues in lunar science and to aid future exploration of the Moon. We\nhave tested various methodologies and parameters therein to interrogate and\nreduce the Moon Zoo crater location and size dataset against a validated expert\nsurvey. We chose the Apollo 17 region as a test area since it offers a broad\nrange of cratered terrains, including secondary-rich areas, older maria, and\nuplands. The assessment involved parallel testing in three key areas: (1)\nfiltering of data to remove problematic mark-ups; (2) clustering methods of\nmultiple notations per crater; and (3) derivation of alternative crater\ndegradation indices, based on the statistical variability of multiple notations\nand the smoothness of local image structures. We compared different\ncombinations of methods and parameters and assessed correlations between\nresulting crater summaries and the expert census.\n  We derived the optimal data reduction steps and settings of the existing Moon\nZoo crater data to agree with the expert census. Further, the regolith depth\nand crater degradation states derived from the data are also found to be in\nbroad agreement with other estimates for the Apollo 17 region. Our study\nsupports the validity of this citizen science project but also recommends\nimprovements in key elements of the data acquisition planning and production.\n", "  Materials with a 5d4 electronic configuration are generally considered to\nhave a nonmagnetic ground state (J=0). Interestingly, Sr2YIrO6 (Ir5+ having 5d4\nelectronic configuration) was recently reported to exhibit long-range magnetic\norder at low temperature and the distorted IrO6 octahedra were discussed to\ncause the magnetism in this material. Hence, a comparison of structurally\ndistorted Sr2YIrO6 with cubic Ba2YIrO6 may shed light on the source of\nmagnetism in such Ir5+ materials with 5d4 configuration. Besides, Ir5+\nmaterials having 5d4 are also interesting in the context of recently predicted\nexcitonic types of magnetism. Here we report a single-crystal-based analysis of\nthe structural, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of Ba2YIrO6. We observe\nthat in Ba2YIrO6 for temperatures down to 0.4 K, long-range magnetic order is\nabsent but at the same time correlated magnetic moments are present. We show\nthat these moments are absent in fully relativistic ab initio band-structure\ncalculations; hence, their origin is presently unclear.\n", "  Numerical prediction of multiscale heat transfer is a challenging problem due\nto the wide range of time and length scales involved. In this work a discrete\nunified gas kinetic scheme (DUGKS) is developed for heat transfer in materials\nwith different acoustic thickness based on the phonon Boltzmann equation. With\ndiscrete phonon direction, the Boltzmann equation is discretized with a\nsecond-order finite-volume formulation, in which the time-step is fully\ndetermined by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The scheme has the\nasymptotic preserving (AP) properties for both diffusive and ballistic regimes,\nand can present accurate solutions in the whole transition regime as well. The\nDUGKS is a self-adaptive multiscale method for the capturing of local transport\nprocess. Numerical tests for both heat transfers with different Knudsen numbers\nare presented to validate the current method.\n", "  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are considered as one of the most appropriate\nsources of cosmic rays with energy exceeding $\\sim 10^{18}$ eV. Virgo A (M87 or\nNGC 4486) is the second closest to the Milky Way active galaxy. According to\nexisting estimations it can be a prominent source of ultra high energy cosmic\nrays (UHECR). However not many events have been registered in the sky region\nnear Virgo A, possibly due to magnetic field influence. In the present work we\ncheck UHECR events from the recent sets of data (AUGER, Telescope Array etc.)\nfor possibility of their origination in this AGN. We carried out the simulation\nof UHECR motion from Virgo A taking into account their deflections in galactic\n(GMF) as well as extragalactic (EGMF) magnetic fields according to the several\nlatest models. The maps of expected UHECR arrival directions were obtained as a\nresult. It has been found the following: 1) UHECR deflection caused by EGMF is\ncomparable with GMF one, moreover the influence of EGMF sometimes is\ndominating; 2) effect of EGMF demonstrates obvious asymmetry in the final\ndistribution of expected UHECR arrival directions; 3) the results of\nsimulations depend on chosen GMF model and are still open for the discussion.\n", "  The demand for petroleum dependent chemicals and materials has been\nincreasing despite the dwindling of their fossil resources. As the dead-end of\npetroleum based industry has started to appear, today's modern society has to\nimplement alternative energy and valuable chemical resources immediately. Owing\nto the importance of lignocellulosic biomass being the most abundant and\nbio-renewable biomass on earth, this critical review provides insights into the\npotential of lignocellulosic biomass as an alternative platform to fossil\nresources. In this context, over 200 value-added compounds, which can be\nderived from lignocellulosic biomass by various treatment methods, are\npresented with their references. Lignocellulosic biomass based polymers and\ntheir commercial importance are also reported mainly in the frame of these\ncompounds. This review article aims to draw the map of lignocellulosic biomass\nderived chemicals and their synthetic polymers, and to reveal the scope of this\nmap in today's modern chemical and polymer industry.\n", "  Since the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis, living systems have developed\nprotective mechanisms against reactive oxygen species. During charge separation\nin photosynthetic reaction centres, triplet states can react with molecular\noxygen generating destructive singlet oxygen. The triplet product yield in\nbacteria is observed to be reduced by weak magnetic fields. Reaction centres\nfrom plants' photosystem II share many features with bacterial reaction\ncentres, including a high-spin iron whose function has remained obscure. To\nexplain observations that the magnetic field effect is reduced by the iron, we\npropose that its fast-relaxing spin plays a protective role in photosynthesis\nby generating an effective magnetic field. We consider a simple model of the\nsystem, derive an analytical expression for the effective magnetic field and\nanalyse the resulting triplet yield reduction. The protective mechanism is\nrobust for realistic parameter ranges, constituting a clear example of a\nquantum effect playing a macroscopic role vital for life.\n", "  A new astrophysical reaction rate for $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\\gamma$)$^{16}$O has\nbeen evaluated on the basis of a global R-matrix fitting to the available\nexperimental data. The reaction rates of $^{12}$C($\\alpha,\\gamma$)$^{16}$O for\nstellar temperatures between 0.04 $\\leq$ $T_9$ $\\leq$ 10 are provided in a\ntabular form and by an analytical fitting expression. At $T_9$ = 0.2, the\nreaction rate is (7.83 $\\pm$ 0.35)$\\times10^{15}$ $\\rm{cm^3 mol^{-1} s^{-1}}$,\nwhere stellar helium burning occurs.\n", "  The investigation of VHE gamma-ray sources by any methods, including mirror\nCherenkov telescopes, touches on the problem of the cosmic ray origin and,\naccordingly, the role of the Galaxy in their generation. The SHALON\nobservations have yielded the results on Galactic shell-type supernova remnants\n(SNR) on different evolution stages. Among them are: SNRs Tycho's SNR, Cas A,\nIC 443, $\\gamma$Cygni SNR and classical nova GK Per (Nova 1901). For each of\nSNRs the observation results are presented with spectral energy distribution by\nSHALON in comparison with other experiment data and images by SHALON. The\ncollected experimental data have confirmed the prediction of the theory about\nthe hadronic generation mechanism of very high energy 800 GeV - 100 TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays in Tycho's SNR, Cas A and IC443.\n", "  Intensity of positron reemission from a metal is related to its work\nfunction. This property is dependent on temperature and can be modified with\ntemperature control. In this article a simple model is proposed to explain and\npredict the variation of the positron work function with temperature. The\ndependence of slow positron yield of metals on temperature is predicted based\non this model and the critical temperatures at which the slow positron yield is\nmaximum is calculated. The proposed model is consistent with experimental\nobservations.\n", "  From an examination of ~18,000 Kepler light curves of K- and M-stars we find\nsome 500 which exhibit rotational periods of less than 2 days. Among such\nstars, approximately 50 show two or more incommensurate periodicities. We\ndiscuss the tools that allow us to differentiate between rotational modulation\nand other types of light variations, e.g., due to pulsations or binary\nmodulations. We find that these multiple periodicities are independent of each\nother and likely belong to different, but physically bound, stars. This\nscenario was checked directly by UKIRT and adaptive optics imaging,\ntime-resolved Fourier transforms, and pixel-level analysis of the data. Our\nresult is potentially important for discovering young multiple stellar systems\namong rapidly rotating K- and M-dwarfs.\n", "  To any differential system $d\\Psi=\\Phi\\Psi$ where $\\Psi$ belongs to a Lie\ngroup (a fiber of a principal bundle) and $\\Phi$ is a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak g$\nvalued 1-form on a Riemann surface $\\Sigma$, is associated an infinite sequence\nof \"correlators\" $W_n$ that are symmetric $n$-forms on $\\Sigma^n$. The goal of\nthis article is to prove that these correlators always satisfy \"loop\nequations\", the same equations satisfied by correlation functions in random\nmatrix models, or the same equations as Virasoro or W-algebra constraints in\nCFT.\n", "  We investigate the electron heating dynamics in electropositive argon and\nhelium capacitively coupled RF discharges driven at 13.56 MHz by Particle in\nCell simulations and by an analytical model. The model allows to calculate the\nelectric field outside the electrode sheaths, space and time resolved within\nthe RF period. Electrons are found to be heated by strong ambipolar electric\nfields outside the sheath during the phase of sheath expansion in addition to\nclassical sheath expansion heating. By tracing individual electrons we also\nshow that ionization is primarily caused by electrons that collide with the\nexpanding sheath edge multiple times during one phase of sheath expansion due\nto backscattering towards the sheath by collisions. A synergistic combination\nof these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is\nrequired to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for\nionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time\nmodulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the\npresence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a\ngiven electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than\ncooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time\naverage. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this\ntime modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion\nand collapse will be enhanced. We propose that the ambipolar electron heating\nshould be included in models describing electron heating in capacitive RF\nplasmas.\n", "  Soft membranes are commonly employed in shape-morphing applications, where\nthe material is programmed to achieve a target shape upon activation by an\nexternal trigger, and as coating layers that alter the surface characteristics\nof bulk materials, such as the properties of spreading and absorption of\nliquids. In particular, polymer gel membranes experience swelling or shrinking\nwhen their solvent content change, and the non-homogeneous swelling field may\nbe exploited to control their shape. Here, we develop a theory of swelling\nmaterial surfaces to model polymer gel membranes and demonstrate its features\nby numerically studying applications in the contexts of biomedicine,\nmicro-motility, and coating technology. We also specialize the theory to\nthermo-responsive gels, which are made of polymers that change their affinity\nwith a solvent when temperature varies.\n", "  A method is presented for optically preparing WS2 monolayers to luminesce\nfrom only the charged exciton (trion) state--completely suppressing the neutral\nexciton. When isolating the trion state, we observed changes in the Raman A1g\nintensity and an enhanced feature on the low energy side of the E12g peak.\nPhotoluminescence and optical reflectivity measurements confirm the existence\nof the prepared trion state. This technique also prepares intermediate regimes\nwith controlled luminescence amplitudes of the neutral and charged exciton.\nThis effect is reversible by exposing the sample to air, indicating the change\nis mitigated by surface interactions with the ambient environment. This method\nprovides a tool to modify optical emission energy and to isolate physical\nprocesses in this and other two-dimensional materials.\n", "  Our purpose is to offer a logical analysis of the system of units and to\nexplore possible paths towards a consistent and unified system with an original\nperspective. The path taken here builds on the fact that, thanks to optical or\nmatter-wave interferometry, any measurement can be reduced to a dimensionless\nphase measurement and we follow this simple guiding line. We finally show how\none could progress even further on the path of a synthetic framework for\nfundamental metrology based upon pure geometry in five dimensions.\n", "  In spite of the almost all-encompassing variability of Be stars, surveys play\na steadily increasing role in complementing the insights gained from\nsingle-star studies. The definition of classical Be stars as recently augmented\nby \\cite{Rivinius2013} enables unambiguous identification of Be stars in a much\nincreased range of observations. Results of targeted surveys are briefly\nreviewed for the effects of metallicity, binarity, and evolution. It still\nremains to be seen whether Be stars are safe benchmarks for the calibration of\nevolutionary models with rapid rotation.\n", "  Encryption of data is fundamental to secure communication in the modern\nworld. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of\nfunctionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating\nclassical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible\n[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate\nschemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have\nnumerous applications.\n  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via\nquantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which\nencompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe\nclassical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description\nor a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of\nobfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,\nindistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three\nvariants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many\napplications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum\nfully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.\n  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of\nfoundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove\nthat quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries\ncan possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic\ntransformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits\nis impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation\nis impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs\ninvolve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which\nwas recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions\nexist [Alagic et al '16].\n", "  High-dimensional quantum entanglement is drawing attention because it enables\nus to perform quantum information tasks that are robust against noises. To test\nthe nonlocality of entangled qudits, the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu\n(CGLMP) inequality has been proposed and demonstrated using qudits based on\norbital angular momentum, time-energy uncertainty, and frequency bins. Here, we\nreport the generation and observation of time-bin entangled ququarts. We\nimplemented a measurement for the CGLMP inequality test using cascaded delay\nMach-Zehnder interferometers fabricated by using planar lightwave circuit\ntechnology, with which we achieved a precise and stable measurement for\ntime-bin-entangled ququarts. In addition, we generated an optimized entangled\nstate by modulating the pump pulse intensities, with which we can observe the\ntheoretical maximum violation for the CGLMP inequality test. As a result, we\nsuccessfully observed a Bell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.774 \\pm 0.025$ violating\nthe CGLMP inequality for the maximally entangled state and an enhanced\nBell-type parameter $S_4 = 2.913 \\pm 0.023$ for the optimized entangled state.\n", "  In this work, a new model for macroscopic plant tissue growth based on\ndynamical Riemannian geometry is presented. We treat 1D and 2D tissues as\ncontinuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The\ndynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor\nequations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a\nnovel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.\n  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root\ngrowth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone\ncommon to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth\nrate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently\ncharacterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a\nbiological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a\nsingle peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our\nmodel, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric\nreaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new\nmaterials.\n  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative\ncurvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are\na proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature\nevolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,\nwe extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a\n2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.\n  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.\nThese include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are\ndynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation\nwhich are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.\n", "  In their recent paper [S\\\"oderlind, P. et al., Sci. Rep. 5, 15958 (2015)],\nS\\\"oderlind et al. discuss two subjects from a theoretical point of view: the\nphonon spectra and the possible magnetic structure of {\\delta}-plutonium (Pu).\nHere, we comment on the second subject. S\\\"oderlind et al. compare the Pu\nmagnetic form factor F(Q) calculated via density functional theory (DFT) with\nmeasurements of F(Q) by neutron spectroscopy [Janoschek, M. et al., Sci. Adv.\n1, e1500188 (2015)]. In particular, this comparison does not consider a number\nof experimental facts established in the neutron spectroscopy study.\n", "  We report a new strategy for fabricating 2D/2D low-resistance ohmic contacts\nfor a variety of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using van der Waals\nassembly of substitutionally doped TMDs as drain/source contacts and TMDs with\nno intentional doping as channel materials. We demonstrate that few-layer WSe2\nfield-effect transistors (FETs) with 2D/2D contacts exhibit low contact\nresistances of ~ 0.3 k ohm.um, high on/off ratios up to > 109, and high drive\ncurrents exceeding 320 uA um-1. These favorable characteristics are combined\nwith a two-terminal field-effect hole mobility ~ 2x102 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room\ntemperature, which increases to >2x103 cm2 V-1 s-1 at cryogenic temperatures.\nWe observe a similar performance also in MoS2 and MoSe2 FETs with 2D/2D drain\nand source contacts. The 2D/2D low-resistance ohmic contacts presented here\nrepresent a new device paradigm that overcomes a significant bottleneck in the\nperformance of TMDs and a wide variety of other 2D materials as the channel\nmaterials in post-silicon electronics.\n", "  The massive black hole at the Galactic Centre is known to be variable in\nradio, millimeter, near-IR and X-rays. We investigate the physical processes\nresponsible for the variable observed emissions from the compact radio source\nSgr A*. We study the evolution of the variable emission region and present\nlight curves and time-resolved spectra of emissions from the accretion disk,\nclose to the event horizon, near the marginally stable orbit of a Kerr black\nhole.\n", "  In this paper we consider a multiscale phase-field model for\ncapillarity-driven flows in porous media. The presented model constitutes a\nreduction of the conventional Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model,\nvalid in situations where interest is restricted to dynamical and equilibrium\nbehavior in an aggregated sense, rather than a precise description of\nmicroscale flow phenomena. The model is based on averaging of the equation of\nmotion, thereby yielding a significant reduction in the complexity of the\nunderlying Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations, while retaining its\nmacroscopic dynamical and equilibrium properties. Numerical results are\npresented for the representative 2-dimensional capillary-rise problem\npertaining to two closely spaced vertical plates with both identical and\ndisparate wetting properties. Comparison with analytical solutions for these\ntest cases corroborates the accuracy of the presented multiscale model. In\naddition, we present results for a capillary-rise problem with a non-trivial\ngeometry corresponding to a porous medium.\n", "  We study the 2D crystalline phases of paramagnetic colloidal particles with\ndipolar interactions and constrained on a periodic substrate. Combining theory,\nsimulation, and experiments we demonstrate a new scenario of first-order phase\ntransitions that occurs via a complete inversion of the energy landscape,\nfeaturing non-conventional properties that allow for: (i) tuning of crystal\nsymmetry; (ii) control of dynamical properties of different crystalline orders\nvia tuning of their relative stability with an external magnetic field; (iii)\nan equivalent but independent control of the same dynamic properties via\ntemporal modulations of that field; and (iv) non-standard phase-ordering\nkinetics involving spontaneous formation of transient metastable domains.\n", "  Nuclear spins are known to experience spontaneous long-range correlations\nonly below 2.5 mili-Kelvin in superfluid $^3$He. Here we present the first\nevidence of nuclear spin coupling in molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) at 74-92 Kelvin\nusing neutron scattering, showing a fundamental change in nature from the\nincoherent scattering universally expected from hydrogen, which reflects single\nparticle properties of uncorrelated nuclear spins, to coherent, with a peak\nmaterializing on the elastic line, indicating H$_2$-H$_2$ nuclear spin\ncorrelations. In this novel phase, the dynamic response of the system also\nchanges nature, and collective excitations with an effective mass of nine H$_2$\nare observed with inelastic scattering at momentum transfers up to 37\n\\AA$^{-1}$, corresponding to length scales smaller than the H-H bond, where\nprevious experiments have always found single atom excitations. This novel\nbehavior has only been observed from H$_2$ within the subnanometer sized\ngraphitic pores of a carbon material, marking the first demonstration that a\nconfined materials environment can be used to control nuclear spin\ncorrelations.\n", "  In this paper a novel physical picture of space-time is introduced by means\nof making a further distinction on the absolute background of space-time and\nthe relative length or duration of base units of space-time. Just based on the\nexistence of the absolute background for space, an explicit dynamical equation\nwhich satisfies a moderately general principle of relativity is logically\nderived under the nonrelativistic framework of classical mechanics. The nature\nof the inertial force is firstly revealed as the real forces acting on the\nreference object. Therefore, Einstein's equivalence principle should be\nabandoned and only the numerical equality between the inertial mass and\ngravitational mass can be retained. Consequently, the candidate for the\nstandard clock should be changed and an adjusted physical picture for how to\nconvert the gravitational force into a geometric effect on space-time is\nthereby presented. As for cosmology, it should be emphasized that the observer\nat the present time on the earth, instead of the comoving observer, is the only\ntrue observer. The coordinate time \"t\" in the cosmological metric is just\nintroduced as the reading number of the observational clock, whose running rate\nis duplicated from the clock equipped by the observer at the present time on\nthe earth. With this new physical picture of space-time, an extra factor $b(t)$\nmust be introduced into the cosmological metric to describe the gravitational\ntime dilation effect since the comoving local intrinsic clock will run in a\nfaster and faster rate with the expanding of the universe. In this way, we may\nobtain a positive value of $\\rho+3p$ and avoid the introduction of dark energy\nin the current universe.\n"]}
