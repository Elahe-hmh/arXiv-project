interface, and manifest them self in it's\nfluctuation profile as well. These ripples apparently flow as the interface\nstruck with inhomogeneous externally driven field interface, moves fluctuating\nabout it on a rectangular 3D Ising system. Ripple structure and flow have\ntemporal periodicity, eventually with some modulation, and have signature of\ngeometry of field interface. Dramatic transitions occur in fluctuation profile\nas a function of dynamics and geometry of the force field interface and is\ndivided into two spatial regions : rippled and smooth. For the velocity we are\nconcerned with, the interface is pinned with field interface, and for arbitrary\norientations of the field profile local slope of the rippled part of the\ninterface gets locked in to a combination of few rational values (Devil's\nstaircase) which most closely approximate the profile, thereby generating\nspecular pattern of patches.\n", "  We settle a long standing issue concerning the traditional derivation of\nnon-compact non-linear sigma models in the theory of disordered electron\nsystems: the hyperbolic Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation of\nPruisken-Schaefer type. Only recently the validity of such transformations was\nproved in the case of U(p,q) (non-compact unitary) and O(p,q) (non-compact\northogonal) symmetry. In this article we give a proof for general non-compact\nsymmetry groups. Moreover we show that the Pruisken-Schaefer type\ntransformations are related to other variants of the HS transformation by\ndeformation of the domain of integration. In particular we clarify the origin\nof surprising sign factors which were recently discovered in the case of\northogonal symmetry.\n", "  Time reversal invariance violating parity conserving effects for low energy\nelastic neutron deuteron scattering are calculated for meson exchange and\nEFT-type of potentials in a Distorted Wave Born Approximation, using realistic\nhadronic wave functions, obtained by solving three-body Faddeev equations in\nconfiguration space.\n", "  We study scalar excitations of high spin operators in N=4 super Yang-Mills\ntheory, which are dual to solitons propagating on a long folded string in AdS_3\nx S^1. In the spin chain description of the gauge theory, these are associated\nto holes in the magnon distribution in the sl(2,R) sector. We compute the\nall-loop hole S-matrix from the asymptotic Bethe ansatz, and expand in leading\norders at weak and strong coupling. The worldsheet S-matrix of solitonic\nexcitations on the GKP string is calculated using semiclassical quantization.\nWe find an exact agreement between the gauge theory and string theory results.\n", "  We propose and prove a new exact duality between the F-terms of\nsupersymmetric gauge theories in five and three dimensions with adjoint matter\nfields. The theories are compactified on a circle and are subject to the Omega\ndeformation. In the limit proposed by Nekrasov and Shatashvili, the\nsupersymmetric vacua become isolated and are identified with the eigenstates of\na quantum integrable system. The effective twisted superpotentials are the\nYang-Yang functional of the relativistic elliptic Calogero-Moser model. We show\nthat they match on-shell by deriving the Bethe ansatz equation from the saddle\npoint of the five-dimensional partition function. We also show that the\nChern-Simons terms match and extend our proposal to the elliptic quiver\ngeneralizations.\n", "  We calculate the central charges a, c and k_G of a large class of\nfour-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories arising from compactifying\nthe six-dimensional N=(2,0) theory on a Riemann surface with regular and\nirregular punctures. We also study the renormalization group flows between the\ngeneral Argyres-Douglas theories, which all agree with the a-theorem.\n", "  We study the influence of the random part of the Galactic magnetic field on\nthe propagation of ultra high-energy cosmic rays. Within very mild\napproximations about the properties of the electron density fluctuations in the\nGalaxy we are able to derive a clear and direct relation between the observed\nvariance of rotation measures and the predicted cosmic ray deflections.\nRemarkably, this is obtained bypassing entirely the detailed knowledge of the\nmagnetic properties of the turbulent plasma. Depending on the parameters of the\nelectron density spectrum, we can either directly estimate the expected\ndeflection, or constrain it from above. Thanks to the latest observational data\non rotation measures, we build a direction-dependent map of such deflections.\nWe find that over most of the sky the random deflections of 40 EeV protons do\nnot exceed 1 to 2 degrees, and can be as large as 5 degrees close to the\nGalactic plane.\n", "  Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) provides a consistent framework to\nevaluate quantitatively the energy flux released to the tip of a growing crack.\nStill, the way in which the crack selects its velocity in response to this\nenergy flux remains far from completely understood. To uncover the underlying\nmechanisms, we experimentally studied damage and dissipation processes that\ndevelop during the dynamic failure of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA),\nclassically considered as the archetype of brittle amorphous materials. We\nevidenced a well-defined critical velocity along which failure switches from\nnominally-brittle to quasi-brittle, where crack propagation goes hand in hand\nwith the nucleation and growth of microcracks. Via post-mortem analysis of the\nfracture surfaces, we were able to reconstruct the complete spatiotemporal\nmicrocracking dynamics with micrometer/nanosecond resolution. We demonstrated\nthat the true local propagation speed of individual crack fronts is limited to\na fairly low value, which can be much smaller than the apparent speed measured\nat the continuum-level scale. By coalescing with the main front, microcracks\nboost the macroscale velocity through an acceleration factor of geometrical\norigin. We discuss the key role of damage-related internal variables in the\nselection of macroscale fracture dynamics.\n", "  There are several first-order logic (FOL) axiomatizations of special\nrelativity theory in the literature, all looking essentially different but\nclaiming to axiomatize the same physical theory. In this paper, we elaborate a\ncomparison, in the framework of mathematical logic, between these FOL theories\nfor special relativity. For this comparison, we use a version of mathematical\ndefinability theory in which new entities can also be defined besides new\nrelations over already available entities. In particular, we build an\ninterpretation of the reference-frame oriented theory SpecRel into the\nobservationally oriented Signalling theory of James Ax. This interpretation\nprovides SpecRel with an operational/experimental semantics. Then we make\nprecise, \"quantitative\" comparisons between these two theories via using the\nnotion of definitional equivalence. This is an application of logic to the\nphilosophy of science and physics in the spirit of Johan van Benthem's work.\n", "  We study a model of information spreading on multiplex networks, in which\nagents interact through multiple interaction channels (layers), say online vs.\\\noffline communication layers, subject to layer-switching cost for transmissions\nacross different interaction layers. The model is characterized by the\nlayer-wise path-dependent transmissibility over a contact, that is dynamically\ndetermined dependently on both incoming and outgoing transmission layers. We\nformulate an analytical framework to deal with such path-dependent\ntransmissibility and demonstrate the nontrivial interplay between the\nmultiplexity and spreading dynamics, including optimality. It is shown that the\nepidemic threshold and prevalence respond to the layer-switching cost\nnon-monotonically and that the optimal conditions can change in abrupt\nnon-analytic ways, depending also on the densities of network layers and the\ntype of seed infections. Our results elucidate the essential role of\nmultiplexity that its explicit consideration should be crucial for realistic\nmodeling and prediction of spreading phenomena on multiplex social networks in\nan era of ever-diversifying social interaction layers.\n", "  In the cryptographic context, an earlier unexplored application of the\ntemporal version of the Bell-type inequality is shown here in the\ndevice-independent (DI) scenario. This is done by using the Leggett-Garg\ninequality (LGI) to demonstrate the security against eavesdropping in a quantum\nkey distribution (QKD) scheme. This typically involves a higher dimensional\nattack against which the standard BB84 protocol is insecure. For this purpose,\nwe invoke an appropriate form of LGI. While the key generation is done by the\nusual Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) method, the security check against device\nattacks is provided by testing for the violation of the particular form of LGI\nused here.\n", "  A simple algorithm is proposed for constructing generators of gauge symmetry\nas well as reducibility relations for arbitrary systems of field equations in\ntwo dimensions.\n", "  Quantum nonlocality concerns correlations among spatially separated systems\nthat cannot be classically explained without post-measurement communication\namong the parties. Thus, a natural measure of nonlocal correlations is provided\nby the minimal amount of communication required for classically simulating\nthem. In this paper, we present a method to compute the minimal communication\ncost, which we call nonlocal capacity, for any general nonsignaling\ncorrelations. This measure turns out to have an important role in communication\ncomplexity and can be used to discriminate between local and nonlocal\ncorrelations, as an alternative to the violation of Bell's inequalities.\n", "  We study the extended prepotentials for the S-duality class of quiver gauge\ntheories, considering them as quasiclassical tau-functions, depending on gauge\ntheory condensates and bare couplings. The residue formulas for the third\nderivatives of extended prepotentials are proven, which lead to effective way\nof their computation, as expansion in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss also\nthe differential equations, following from the residue formulas, including the\nWDVV equations, proven to be valid for the $SU(2)$ quiver gauge theories. As a\nparticular example we consider the constrained conformal quiver gauge theory,\ncorresponding to the Zamolodchikov conformal blocks by 4d/2d duality. In this\ncase part of the found differential equations turn into nontrivial relations\nfor the period matrices of hyperelliptic curves.\n", "  The investigation of universality questions for local eigenvalue statistics\ncontinues to be a driving force in the theory of Random Matrices. For Matrix\nModels [53] the method of orthogonal polynomials can be used and the\nasymptotics of the Christoffel-Darboux kernel [59] become the key for studying\nuniversality. In this paper the existing results on the CD-kernel will be\nextended in two directions. Firstly, in order to analyze the transition from\nthe universal to the non-universal regime, we provide leading order asymptotics\nthat are global rather than local. This allows e.g. to describe the moderate\ndeviations for the largest eigenvalues of unitary ensembles ($\\beta$ = 2),\nwhere such a transition occurs. Secondly, our asymptotics will be uniform under\nperturbations of the probability measure that defines the matrix ensemble. Such\ninformation is useful for the analysis of a different type of ensembles [25],\nwhich is not known to be determinantal and for which the method of orthogonal\npolynomials cannot be used directly. The just described applications of our\nresults are formulated in this paper but will be proved elsewhere. As a\nbyproduct of our analysis we derive first order corrections for the 1-point\ncorrelation functions of unitary ensembles in the bulk. Our proofs are based on\nthe nonlinear steepest descent method [20]. They follow closely [17] and\nincorporate improvements introduced in [36, 64]. The presentation is\nself-contained except for a number of general facts from Random Matrix theory\nand from the theory of singular integral operators.\n", "  We provide a unified description, both at the effective and fundamental\nLagrangian level, of models of composite Higgs dynamics where the Higgs itself\ncan emerge, depending on the way the electroweak symmetry is embedded, either\nas a pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a massive excitation of the condensate. We\nshow that, in general, these states mix with repercussions on the electroweak\nphysics and phenomenology. Our results will help clarify the main differences,\nsimilarities, benefits and shortcomings of the different ways one can naturally\nrealize a composite nature of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model. We\nwill analyze the minimal underlying realization in terms of fundamental\nstrongly coupled gauge theories supporting the flavor symmetry breaking pattern\nSU(4)/Sp(4) $\\sim$ SO(6)/SO(5). The most minimal fundamental description\nconsists of an SU(2) gauge theory with two Dirac fermions transforming\naccording to the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This minimal\nchoice enables us to use recent first principle lattice results to make the\nfirst predictions for the massive spectrum for models of composite (Goldstone)\nHiggs dynamics. These results are of the upmost relevance to guide searches of\nnew physics at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  We propose here that the well-known black hole paradoxes such as the\ninformation loss and teleological nature of the event horizon are restricted to\na particular idealized case, which is the homogeneous dust collapse model. In\nthis case, the event horizon, which defines the boundary of the black hole,\nforms initially, and the singularity in the interior of the black hole at a\nlater time. We show that, in contrast, gravitational collapse from physically\nmore realistic initial conditions typically leads to the scenario in which the\nevent horizon and space-time singularity form simultaneously. We point out that\nthis apparently simple modification can mitigate the causality and teleological\nparadoxes, and also lends support to two recently suggested solutions to the\ninformation paradox, namely, the `firewall' and `classical chaos' proposals.\n", "  We present a family of exact solutions, depending on two parameters $\\alpha$\nand $b$ (related to the scalar field strength), to the three-dimensional\nEinstein-scalar field equations with negative cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.\nFor $b=0$ these solutions reduce to the static BTZ family of vacuum solutions,\nwith mass $M = -\\alpha$. For $b\\neq0$, the solutions become dynamical and\ndevelop a strong spacelike central singularity. The $\\alpha<0$ solutions are\nblack-hole like, with a global structure topologically similar to that of the\nBTZ black holes, and a finite effective mass. We show that the near-singularity\nbehavior of the solutions with $\\alpha>0$ agrees qualitatively with that\nobserved in numerical simulations of subcritical collapse. We analyze the\nlinear perturbations of the threshold solution, $\\alpha=0$, in the $\\Lambda=0$\napproximation, and find that it has only one unstable growing mode, which\nqualifies it as a candidate critical solution for scalar field collapse.\n", "  We prove that the complex conjugate (c.c.) eigenvalues of a smoothly varying\nreal matrix attract (Eq. 15). We offer a dynamical perspective on the motion\nand interaction of the eigenvalues in the complex plane, derive their governing\nequations and discuss applications. C.c. pairs closest to the real axis, or\nthose that are ill-conditioned, attract most strongly and can collide to become\nexactly real. As an application we consider random perturbations of a fixed\nmatrix $M$. If $M$ is Normal, the total expected force on any eigenvalue is\nshown to be only the attraction of its c.c. (Eq. 24) and when $M$ is circulant\nthe strength of interaction can be related to the power spectrum of white\nnoise. We extend this by calculating the expected force (Eq. 41) for real\nstochastic processes with zero-mean and independent intervals. To quantify the\ndominance of the c.c. attraction, we calculate the variance of other forces. We\napply the results to the Hatano-Nelson model and provide other numerical\nillustrations. It is our hope that the simple dynamical perspective herein\nmight help better understanding of the aggregation and low density of the\neigenvalues of real random matrices on and near the real line respectively. In\nthe appendix we provide a Matlab code for plotting the trajectories of the\neigenvalues.\n", "  We present results for mass effects coming from secondary radiation of heavy\nquark pairs related to gluon splitting in the thrust distribution for e+e-\ncollisions. The results are given in the dijet limit where the hard interaction\nscale and the scales related to collinear and soft radiation are widely\nseparated. We account for the corresponding fixed-order corrections at\nO(alpha_s^2) and the summation of all logarithmic terms related to the hard,\ncollinear and soft scales as well as the quark mass at N3LL order. We also\nremove the O(Lambda_QCD) renormalon in the partonic soft function leading to an\ninfrared evolution equation with a matching condition related to the massive\nquark threshold. The quark mass can be arbitrary, ranging from the infinitely\nheavy case, where decoupling takes place, down to the massless limit where the\nresults smoothly merge into the well known predictions for massless quarks. Our\nresults are formulated in the framework of factorization theorems for e+e-\ndijet production and provide universal threshold corrections for the\nrenormalization group evolution of the hard current, the jet and soft functions\nat the scale where the massive quarks are integrated out. The results represent\na first explicit realization of a variable flavor number scheme for final state\njets along the lines of the well known flavor number dependent evolution of the\nstrong coupling alpha_s and the parton distribution functions.\n", "  Exterior Differential Systems (EDS) and Cartan forms, set in the state space\nof field variables taken together with four space-time variables, are\nformulated for classical gauge theories of Maxwell and SU(2) Yang-Mills fields\nminimally coupled to Dirac spinor multiplets. Cartan character tables are\ncalculated, showing whether the EDS, and so the Euler-Lagrange partial\ndifferential equations, is well-posed. The first theory, with 22 dimensional\nstate space (10 Maxwell field and potential components and 8 components of a\nDirac field), anticipates QED. In the second, non-Abelian, case (30 Yang-Mills\nfield components and 16 Dirac), only if three additional \"ghost\" fields are\nincluded (15 more scalar variables) is a well-posed EDS found. This classical\nformulation anticipates the need for introduction of Fadeev-Popov ghost fields\nin the quantum standard model.\n", "  Despite the tremendous advancements in the field of network theory, very few\nstudies have taken weights in the interactions into consideration that emerge\nnaturally in all real world systems. Using random matrix analysis of a weighted\nsocial network, we demonstrate the profound impact of weights in interactions\non emerging structural properties. The analysis reveals that randomness\nexisting in particular time frame affects the decisions of individuals\nrendering them more freedom of choice in situations of financial security.\nWhile the structural organization of networks remain same throughout all\ndatasets, random matrix theory provides insight into interaction pattern of\nindividual of the society in situations of crisis. It has also been\ncontemplated that individual accountability in terms of weighted interactions\nremains as a key to success unless segregation of tasks comes into play.\n", "  Controlling strongly interacting many-body systems enables the creation of\ntailored quantum matter, with properties transcending those based solely on\nsingle particle physics. Atomic ensembles which are optically driven to a\nRydberg state provide many examples of this, such as atom-atom entanglement,\nmany-body Rabi oscillations, strong photon-photon interaction and spatial pair\ncorrelations. In its most basic form, Rydberg quantum matter consists of an\nisolated ensemble of strongly interacting atoms spatially confined to the\nblockade volume - a so-called superatom. Here we demonstrate the controlled\ncreation and characterization of an isolated mesoscopic superatom by means of\naccurate density engineering and excitation to Rydberg $p$-states. Its variable\nsize allows to investigate the transition from effective two-level physics for\nstrong confinement to many-body phenomena in extended systems. By monitoring\ncontinuous laser-induced ionization we observe a strongly anti-bunched ion\nemission under blockade conditions and extremely bunched ion emission under\noff-resonant excitation. Our experimental setup enables in vivo measurements of\nthe superatom, yielding insight into both excitation statistics and dynamics.\nWe anticipate straightforward applications in quantum optics and quantum\ninformation as well as future experiments on many-body physics.\n", "  We re-analyse the subset of the Faraday rotation measures data from the NRAO\nVLA Sky Survey catalogue for which redshift and spectral index information is\navailable, in order to better elucidate the relations between these\nobservables. We split this subset in two based on their radio luminosity, and\nfind that higher power sources have a systematically higher residual rotation\nmeasure, once the regular field of the Milky Way is subtracted. This rotation\nmeasure stands well above the variances due to the turbulent field of our\nGalaxy and measurement errors, contrarily to low power sources. The effect is\nmore pronounced as the energy threshold becomes more restrictive. If the two\nsets are merged one observes an apparent evolution of rotation measure with\nredshift, but our analysis shows that this can be interpreted as an artifact of\nthe different intrinsic properties of brighter sources that are typically\nobserved at larger distances.\n", "  We give a Finsler non-linear connection by a new simplified definition for\nnot only regular case but also singular case. In regular case, it corresponds\nto non-linear connection part of Berwald's connection, but our connection is\nexpressed not in line element space but in point-Finsler space. In this view we\nrecognize Finsler metric L(x,dx) as a non-linear form, which is a natural\ngeneralisation of Riemannian metric having original expression,\n\\sqrt{g_{ab}(x)dx^a dx^b}. Furthermore our formulae provide easier calculation\nrather than conventional treatments, so we think that they suits to application\nto physics. Our definition can be used in the singular case of Finsler metric,\nwhich correspond to gauged constraint systems in mechanics. Here we give some\nnon trivial examples of constraint systems for exposition of validity of our\nconnection.\n", "  We propose a protocol to construct the 35 $f$-controlled phase gates of a\nthree-qubit refined Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm, by using single-qubit\n$\\sigma_z$ gates, two-qubit controlled phase gates, and two-target-qubit\ncontrolled phase gates. Using this protocol, we discuss how to implement the\nthree-qubit refined DJ algorithm with superconducting transmon qutrits\nresonantly coupled to a single cavity. Our numerical calculation shows that\nimplementation of this quantum algorithm is feasible within the present circuit\nQED technique. The experimental realization of this algorithm would be an\nimportant step toward more complex quantum computation in circuit QED.\n", "  We compute the time-resolved photoemission spectrum after photo-doping in a\ntwo-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulator. We find that the relaxation rate of\nhigh-energy photo-doped electrons in the paramagnetic phase scales with the\nstrength of the nearest-neighbor spin correlations, which implies a pronounced\nincrease of the relaxation times with temperature and excitation density.\nFinite doping, in contrast, opens additional scattering channels and leads to a\nfaster relaxation. To obtain our results we have implemented a nonequilibrium\nversion of the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), which, in contrast to\nsingle-site dynamical mean-field theory, captures the effect of short-range\ncorrelations.\n", "  Doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) with optimized orbitals\noften accurately describes strong correlations while working in a Hilbert space\nmuch smaller than that needed for full configuration interaction. However, the\nscaling of such calculations remains combinatorial with system size. Pair\ncoupled cluster doubles (pCCD) is very successful in reproducing DOCI\nenergetically, but can do so with low polynomial scaling ($N^3$, disregarding\nthe two-electron integral transformation from atomic to molecular orbitals). We\nshow here several examples illustrating the success of pCCD in reproducing both\nthe DOCI energy and wave function, and show how this success frequently comes\nabout. What DOCI and pCCD lack are an effective treatment of dynamic\ncorrelations, which we here add by including higher-seniority cluster\namplitudes which are excluded from pCCD. This frozen pair coupled cluster\napproach is comparable in cost to traditional closed-shell coupled cluster\nmethods with results that are competitive for weakly correlated systems and\noften superior for the description of strongly correlated systems.\n", "  The partition function of ABJ(M) theories on the three-sphere can be regarded\nas the canonical partition function of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial\nHamiltonian. We propose an exact expression for the spectral determinant of\nthis Hamiltonian, which generalizes recent results obtained in the maximally\nsupersymmetric case. As a consequence, we find an exact WKB quantization\ncondition determining the spectrum which is in agreement with numerical\nresults. In addition, we investigate the factorization properties and\nfunctional equations for our conjectured spectral determinants. These\nfunctional equations relate the spectral determinants of ABJ theories with\nconsecutive ranks of gauge groups but the same Chern-Simons coupling.\n", "  Rates of stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) by supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) due to two-body relaxation are calculated using a large galaxy sample\n(N=146) in order to explore the sensitivity of the TDE rates to observational\nuncertainties, such as the parametrization of galaxy light profiles and the\nstellar mass function. The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly\nconstrained occupation fraction of SMBHs in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise\ndominate the total TDE rate. The detection rate of TDE flares by optical\nsurveys is calculated as a function of SMBH mass and other observables for\nseveral physically-motivated models of TDE emission. We also quantify the\nfraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the\nmajority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington\nluminosities (such as disk winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis\nrelativistic jet), then the measured SMBH mass distribution will tightly\nconstrain the low-end SMBH occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission\nchannels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much\nless pronounced in a flux-limited survey (although still present in a\nvolume-complete event sample). The SMBH mass distribution of the current sample\nof TDEs, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects,\nalready suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our\nmost conservative rate estimates appear to be in tension with much lower\nobservationally inferred TDE rates, and we discuss several possible resolutions\nto this discrepancy.\n", "  In this work, we consider time-periodic structures of trimer granular\ncrystals consisting of alternate chrome steel and tungsten carbide spherical\nparticles yielding a spatial periodicity of three. The configuration at the\nleft boundary is driven by a harmonic in-time actuation with given amplitude\nand frequency while the right one is a fixed wall. Similar to the case of a\ndimer chain, the combination of dissipation, driving of the boundary, and\nintrinsic nonlinearity leads to complex dynamics. For fixed driving frequencies\nin each of the spectral gaps, we find that the nonlinear surface modes and the\nstates dictated by the linear drive collide in a saddle-node bifurcation as the\ndriving amplitude is increased, beyond which the dynamics of the system become\nchaotic. While the bifurcation structure is similar for solutions within the\nfirst and second gap, those in the first gap appear to be less robust. We also\nconduct a continuation in driving frequency, where it is apparent that the\nnonlinearity of the system results in a complex bifurcation diagram, involving\nan intricate set of loops of branches, especially within the spectral gap. The\ntheoretical findings are qualitatively corroborated by the experimental\nfull-field visualization of the time-periodic structures.\n", "  Self-consistent field extrapolation methods play a pivotal role in quantum\nchemistry and electronic structure theory. We here demonstrate the mathematical\nequivalence between the recently proposed family of LIST methods [J. Chem.\nPhys. 134, 241103 (2011); J. Chem. Theory Comput. 7, 3045 (2011)] with Pulay's\nDIIS [Chem. Phys. Lett. 73, 393 (1980)]. Our results also explain the\ndifferences in performance among the various LIST methods.\n", "  The temporal evolution of mechanical energy and spatially-averaged crack\nspeed are both monitored in slowly fracturing artificial rocks. Both signals\ndisplay an irregular burst-like dynamics, with power-law distributed\nfluctuations spanning a broad range of scales. Yet, the elastic power released\nat each time step is proportional to the global velocity all along the process,\nwhich enables defining a material-constant fracture energy. We characterize the\nintermittent dynamics by computing the burst statistics. This latter displays\nthe scale-free features signature of crackling dynamics, in qualitative but not\nquantitative agreement with the depinning interface models derived for fracture\nproblems. The possible sources of discrepancies are pointed out and discussed.\n", "  The rotor-router model on a graph describes a discrete-time walk accompanied\nby the deterministic evolution of configurations of rotors randomly placed on\nvertices of the graph. We prove the following property: if at some moment of\ntime, the rotors form a closed clockwise contour on the planar graph, then the\nclockwise rotations of rotors generate a walk which enters into the contour at\nsome vertex $v$, performs a number of steps inside the contour so that the\ncontour formed by rotors becomes anti-clockwise, and then leaves the contour at\nthe same vertex $v$. This property generalizes the previously proved theorem\nfor the case when the rotor configuration inside the contour is a cycle-rooted\nspanning tree, and all rotors inside the contour perform a full rotation. We\nuse the proven property for an analysis of the sub-diffusive behavior of the\nrotor-router walk.\n", "  In weakly ferromagnetic materials, already small changes in the atomic\nconfiguration triggered by temperature or chemistry can alter the magnetic\ninteractions responsible for the non-random atomic-spin orientation. Different\nmagnetic states, in turn, can give rise to substantially different macroscopic\nproperties. A classical example is iron, which exhibits a great variety of\nproperties as one gradually removes the magnetic long-range order by raising\nthe temperature towards and beyond its Curie point of\n$T_{\\text{C}}^{0}=1043$\\,K. Using first-principles theory, here we demonstrate\nthat uniaxial tensile strain can also destabilize the magnetic order in iron\nand eventually lead to a ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition at\ntemperatures far below $T_{\\text{C}}^{0}$. In consequence, the intrinsic\nstrength of the ideal single-crystal body-centered cubic iron dramatically\nweakens above a critical temperature of $\\sim 500$\\,K. The discovered\nstrain-induced magneto-mechanical softening provides a plausible atomic-level\nmechanism behind the observed drop of the measured strength of Fe whiskers\naround $300-500$\\,K. Alloying additions which have the capability to partially\nrestore the magnetic order in the strained Fe lattice, push the critical\ntemperature for the strength-softening scenario towards the magnetic transition\ntemperature of the undeformed lattice. This can result in a surprisingly large\nalloying-driven strengthening effect at high temperature as illustrated here in\nthe case of Fe-Co alloy.\n", "  We present a model based on the $SU(3)_{C}\\otimes SU(3)_{L}\\otimes U(1)_{X}$\ngauge symmetry having an extra $T_{7}\\otimes Z_{2}\\otimes Z_{3}\\otimes Z_{14} $\nflavor group, which successfully describes the observed SM fermion mass and\nmixing pattern. In this framework, the light active neutrino masses arise via\ndouble seesaw mechanism and the observed charged fermion mass and quark mixing\nhierarchy is a consequence of the $Z_{2}\\otimes Z_{3}\\otimes Z_{14}$ symmetry\nbreaking at very high energy. In our minimal $T_{7}$ flavor 331 model, the\nspectrum of neutrinos includes very light active neutrinos as well as heavy and\nvery heavy sterile neutrinos. The model has in total 16 effective free\nparameters, which are fitted to reproduce the experimental values of the 18\nphysical observables in the quark and lepton sectors. The obtained physical\nobservables for both quark and lepton sectors are compatible with their\nexperimental values. The model predicts the effective Majorana neutrino mass\nparameter of neutrinoless double beta decay to be $% m_{\\beta \\beta }=$ 3 and\n40 meV for the normal and the inverted neutrino spectrum, respectively.\nFurthermore, our model features a vanishing leptonic Dirac CP violating phase.\n", "  We develop a general perturbative analysis on vacuum spacetimes which can be\nconstructed by generating manifolds of revolution around a curve, and apply it\nto the Schwarzschild metric. The following different perturbations are carried\nout separately: 1) Non-rotating 2-spheres are added along a plane curve\nslightly deviated from the ``Schwarzschild line''; 2) General non-rotating\ntopological 2-spheres are added along the ``Schwarzschild line'' 3)\nSlow-rotating 2-spheres are added along the ``Schwarzschild line''. For (1), we\nobtain the first order vacuum solution and show that no higher order solution\nexists. This linearised vacuum solution turns out however to be just a gauge\ntransformation of the Schwarzschild metric. For (2), we solve the general\nlinearised vacuum equations under several special cases. In particular, there\nexist linearised vacuum solutions with signature-changing metrics that contain\nclosed timelike curves (though these do not correspond to adding topological\n2-spheres). For (3), we find that the first order vacuum solution is equivalent\nto the slowly rotating Kerr metric. This is hence a much simpler and\ngeometrically insightful derivation as compared to the gravitomagnetic one,\nwhere this rotating-shells construction is a direct manifestation of the\nframe-dragging phenomenon. We also show that the full Kerr however, cannot be\nobtained via adding rotating ellipsoids.\n", "  We evaluate the free energy of the fluid and crystal phases for the ST2\npotential [F.H. Stillinger and A. Rahman, J. Chem. Phys. 60, 1545 (1974)] with\nreaction field corrections for the long-range interactions. We estimate the\nphase coexistence boundaries in the temperature-pressure plane, as well as the\ngas-liquid critical point and gas-liquid coexistence conditions. Our study\nframes the location of the previously identified liquid-liquid critical point\nrelative to the crystalline phase boundaries, and opens the way for exploring\ncrystal nucleation in a model where the metastable liquid-liquid critical point\nis computationally accessible.\n", "  Quantum anomalies, breakdown of classical symmetries by quantum effects,\nprovide a sharp definition of symmetry protected topological phases. In\nparticular, they can diagnose interaction effects on the non-interacting\nclassification of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases. In this\npaper, we identify quantum anomalies in two kinds of (3+1)-dimensional\nfermionic symmetry protected topological phases: (i) topological insulators\nprotected by CP (charge conjugation $\\times$ reflection) and electromagnetic\n$\\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetries, and (ii) topological superconductors protected by\nreflection symmetry. For the first example, which is related to, by\nCPT-theorem, time-reversal symmetric topological insulators, we show that the\nCP-projected partition function of the surface theory is not invariant under\nlarge $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge transformations, but picks up an anomalous sign,\nsignaling a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification. Similarly, for the\nsecond example, which is related to, by CPT-theorem, time-reversal symmetric\ntopological superconductors, we discuss the invariance/non-invariance of the\npartition function of the surface theory, defined on the three-torus and its\ndescendants generated by the orientifold projection, under large\ndiffeomorphisms (3d modular transformations). The connection to the collapse of\nthe non-interacting classification by an integer ($\\mathbb{Z}$) to\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{16}$, in the presence of interactions, is discussed.\n", "  A model for autonomous feedback control of particle transport through a large\nnumber of channels is introduced. Interactions among the particles can lead to\na strong suppression of fluctuations in the particle number statistics. Within\na mean-field type limit, the collective control mechanism becomes equivalent to\na synchronization with an external clock. The diffusive spreading of the\nfeedback signal across the channels shows scaling, can be quantified via the\nflow of information, and shows up, e.g., in the spectral function of the\nparticle noise.\n", "  The accurate and efficient description of strongly correlated systems remains\nan important challenge for computational methods. Doubly occupied configuration\ninteraction (DOCI), in which all electrons are paired and no correlations which\nbreak these pairs are permitted, can in many cases provide an accurate account\nof strong correlations, albeit at combinatorial computational cost. Recently,\nthere has been significant interest in a method we refer to as pair coupled\ncluster doubles (pCCD), a variant of coupled cluster doubles in which the\nelectrons are paired. This is simply because pCCD provides energies nearly\nidentical to those of DOCI, but at mean-field computational cost (disregarding\nthe cost of the two-electron integral transformation). Here, we introduce the\nmore complete pair extended coupled cluster doubles (pECCD) approach which,\nlike pCCD, has mean-field cost and reproduces DOCI energetically. We show that\nunlike pCCD, pECCD also reproduces the DOCI wave function with high accuracy.\nMoreoever, pECCD yields sensible albeit inexact results even for attractive\ninteractions where pCCD breaks down.\n", "  The observed high covering fractions of neutral hydrogen (HI) with column\ndensities above $\\sim 10^{17} \\rm{cm}^{-2}$ around Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs)\nand bright quasars at redshifts z ~ 2-3 has been identified as a challenge for\nsimulations of galaxy formation. We use the EAGLE cosmological, hydrodynamical\nsimulation, which has been shown to reproduce a wide range of galaxy properties\nand for which the subgrid feedback was calibrated without considering gas\nproperties, to study the distribution of HI around high-redshift galaxies. We\npredict the covering fractions of strong HI absorbers ($N_{\\rm{HI}} \\gtrsim\n10^{17} \\rm{cm}^{-2}$) inside haloes to increase rapidly with redshift but to\ndepend only weakly on halo mass. For massive ($M_{200} \\gtrsim 10^{12} {\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$) halos the covering fraction profiles are nearly scale-invariant\nand we provide fitting functions that reproduce the simulation results. While\nefficient feedback is required to increase the HI covering fractions to the\nhigh observed values, the distribution of strong absorbers in and around halos\nof a fixed mass is insensitive to factor of two variations in the strength of\nthe stellar feedback. In contrast, at fixed stellar mass the predicted HI\ndistribution is highly sensitive to the feedback efficiency. The fiducial EAGLE\nsimulation reproduces both the observed global column density distribution\nfunction of HI and the observed radial covering fraction profiles of strong HI\nabsorbers around LBGs and bright quasars.\n", "  The adhesion bonds connecting a lipid bilayer to an underlying surface may\nundergo a condensation transition resulting from an interplay between a short\nrange attractive potential between them, and a long range fluctuation-induced\npotential of mean force. Here, we use computer simulations of a coarse-grained\nmolecular model of supported lipid bilayers to study this transition in\nconfined membranes, and in membranes subjected to a non-vanishing surface\ntension. Our results show that confinement may alter significantly the\ncondensation transition of the adhesion bonds, whereas the application of\nsurface tension has a very minor effect on it. We also investigate domain\nformation in membranes under negative tension which, in free membranes, causes\nenhancement of the amplitude of the membrane thermal undulations. Our results\nindicate that in supported membranes, this effect of a negative surface tension\non the fluctuation spectrum is largely eliminated by the pressure resulting\nfrom the mixing entropy of the adhesion bonds.\n", "  One goal in the quantum-walk research is the exploitation of the intrinsic\nquantum nature of multiple walkers, in order to achieve the full computational\npower of the model. Here we study the behaviour of two non-interacting\nparticles performing a quantum walk on the line when the possibility of lattice\nimperfections, in the form of missing links, is considered. We investigate two\nregimes, statical and dynamical percolation, that correspond to different time\nscales for the imperfections evolution with respect to the quantum-walk one. By\nstudying the qualitative behaviour of three two-particle quantities for\ndifferent probabilities of having missing bonds, we argue that the chosen\nsymmetry under particle-exchange of the input state strongly affects the output\nof the walk, even in noisy and highly non-ideal regimes. We provide evidence\nagainst the possibility of gathering information about the walkers\nindistinguishability from the observation of bunching phenomena in the output\ndistribution, in all those situations that require a comparison between\naveraged quantities. Although the spread of the walk is not substantially\nchanged by the addition of a second particle, we show that the presence of\nmultiple walkers can be beneficial for a procedure to estimate the probability\nof having a broken link.\n", "  The recent detection of charge-density modulations in YBa2Cu3Oy and other\ncuprate superconductors raises new questions about the normal state of\nunderdoped cuprates. In one class of theories, the modulations are intertwined\nwith pairing in a dual state, expected to persist up to high magnetic fields as\na vortex liquid. In support of such a state, specific heat and magnetisation\ndata on YBa2Cu3Oy have been interpreted in terms of a vortex liquid persisting\nabove the vortex-melting field Hvs at T = 0. Here we report high-field\nmeasurements of the electrical and thermal Hall conductivities in YBa2Cu3O6.54\nthat allow us to probe the Wiedemann-Franz law, a sensitive test of the\npresence of superconductivity in a metal. In the T = 0 limit, we find that the\nlaw is satisfied for fields immediately above Hvs. This rules out the existence\nof a vortex liquid and it places strict constraints on the nature of the normal\nstate in underdoped cuprates.\n", "  We give a review, in the style of an essay, of the author's 1998\nmatter-gravity entanglement hypothesis which, unlike the standard approach to\nentropy based on coarse-graining, offers a definition for the entropy of a\nclosed system as a real and objective quantity. We explain how this approach\noffers an explanation for the Second Law of Thermodynamics in general and a\nnon-paradoxical understanding of information loss during black hole formation\nand evaporation in particular. It also involves a radically different from\nusual description of black hole equilibrium states in which the total state of\na black hole in a box together with its atmosphere is a pure state -- entangled\nin just such a way that the reduced state of the black hole and of its\natmosphere are each separately approximately thermal. We also briefly recall\nsome recent work of the author which involves a reworking of the string-theory\nunderstanding of black hole entropy consistent with this alternative\ndescription of black hole equilibrium states and point out that this is free\nfrom some unsatisfactory features of the usual string theory understanding. We\nalso recall the author's recent arguments based on this alternative description\nwhich suggest that the AdS/CFT correspondence is a bijection between the\nboundary CFT and just the matter degrees of freedom of the bulk theory.\n", "  We study the 't Hooft coupling $g_{t}$ and the mass splitting of the\nground-state baryons in a chiral quark model inspired by the large $N_{c}$ QCD.\nDepending on $g_{t}$ the Hartree wavefunction of light quark in baryons is used\nto map the mass hyperfine splittings for the octet and decuplet baryons. The 't\nHooft coupling $g_{t}$ that reproduces the data of baryon masses is determined\nto be around $1.57$, which is small in the sense that $g_{t}^{2}/(4\\pi\nN_{c})\\ll $$1$.\n", "  Specific heat measurements constitute one of the most powerful experimental\nmethods to probe fundamental excitations in solids. After the proposition of\nEinstein's model, more than one century ago (Annalen der Physik \\textbf{22},\n180 (1907)), several theoretical models have been proposed to describe\nexperimental results. Here we report on a detailed analysis of the two-peak\nspecific heat anomalies observed in several materials. Employing a simple\nmultilevel model, varying the spacing between the energy levels $\\Delta_i$ =\n$(E_i$ $-$ $E_{0})$ and the degeneracy of each energy level $g_i$, we derive\nthe required conditions for the appearance of such anomalies. Our findings\nindicate that a ratio of $\\Delta_2$/$\\Delta_1$ $\\thickapprox$ 10 between the\nenergy levels and a high degeneracy of one of the energy levels define the\ntwo-peaks regime in the specific heat. Our approach accurately matches recent\nexperimental results. Furthermore, using a mean-field approach we calculate the\nspecific heat of a degenerate Schottky-like system undergoing a ferromagnetic\n(FM) phase transition. Our results reveal that as the degeneracy is increased\nthe Schottky maximum in the specific heat becomes narrow while the peak\nassociated with the FM transition remains unaffected.\n", "  We present an efficient implementation for the evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j,\nand 9j symbols. These represent numerical transformation coefficients that are\nused in the quantum theory of angular momentum. They can be expressed as sums\nand square roots of ratios of integers. The integers can be very large due to\nfactorials. We avoid numerical precision loss due to cancellation through the\nuse of multi-word integer arithmetic for exact accumulation of all sums. A\nfixed relative accuracy is maintained as the limited number of floating-point\noperations in the final step only incur rounding errors in the least\nsignificant bits. Time spent to evaluate large multi-word integers is in turn\nreduced by using explicit prime factorisation of the ingoing factorials,\nthereby improving execution speed. Comparison with existing routines shows the\nefficiency of our approach and we therefore provide a computer code based on\nthis work.\n", "  To adopt a practical method to calculate the action of geometrical operators\non quantum states is a crucial task in loop quantum gravity. In the series of\npapers, we will introduce a graphical method, developed by Yutsis and Brink, to\nloop quantum gravity along the line of previous works. The graphical method\nprovides a very powerful technique for simplifying complicated calculations. In\nthis first paper, the closed formula of volume operator is derived via the\ngraphical method. By employing suitable and non-ambiguous graphs to represent\nthe acting of operators as well as the spin network states, we use the simple\nrules of transforming graphs to yield the resulting formula. Comparing with the\ncomplicated algebraic derivation in some literatures, our procedure is more\nconcise, intuitive and visual. The resulting matrix elements of volume operator\nis compact and uniform, fitting for both gauge-invariant and gauge-variant spin\nnetwork states.\n", "  This is the second paper in the series to introduce a graphical method to\nloop quantum gravity. We employ the graphical method as a powerful tool to\ncalculate the actions of the Euclidean Hamiltonian constraint operator and the\nso-called inverse volume operator on spin network states with trivalent\nvertices. Both of the operators involve the co-triad operator which contains\nholonomies by construction. The non-ambiguous, concise and visual characters of\nour graphical method ensure the rigour for our calculations. Our results\nindicate some corrections to the existing results in literatures.\n", "  Depending on whether electroweak physics beyond the Standard Model is based\non a linear or on a non-linear implementation of the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, a linear or a chiral Effective Lagrangian is more appropriate. In\nthis talk, the main low-energy signals that allow to recognize whether the\nobserved Higgs scalar is a dynamical (composite) particle or rather an\nelementary one are presented, in a model-independent way. The patterns of\neffective couplings produced upon the assumption of specific composite Higgs\nmodels are also discussed.\n", "  Seitenzahl et al. (2009) have predicted that roughly three years after its\nexplosion, the light we receive from a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) will come\nmostly from reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the radioactive\ndecay chain $^{57}{\\rm Co}~\\to~^{57}{\\rm Fe}$, instead of positrons from the\ndecay chain $^{56}{\\rm Co}~\\to~^{56}{\\rm Fe}$ that dominates the SN light at\nearlier times. Using the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope}, we followed the light\ncurve of the SN Ia SN 2012cg out to $1055$ days after maximum light. Our\nmeasurements are consistent with the light curves predicted by the contribution\nof energy from the reprocessing of electrons and X-rays emitted by the decay of\n$^{57}$Co, offering evidence that $^{57}$Co is produced in SN Ia explosions.\nHowever, the data are also consistent with a light echo $\\sim14$ mag fainter\nthan SN 2012cg at peak. Assuming no light-echo contamination, the mass ratio of\n$^{57}$Ni and $^{56}$Ni produced by the explosion, a strong constraint on any\nSN Ia explosion model, is $0.043^{+0.012}_{-0.011}$, roughly twice Solar. In\nthe context of current explosion models, this value favors a progenitor white\ndwarf with a mass near the Chandrasekhar limit.\n", "  We obtain higher dimensional analogues of the results of Mantoulidis and\nSchoen in [8]. More precisely, we show that (i) any metric $g$ with positive\nscalar curvature on the $3$-sphere $S^3$ can be realized as the induced metric\non the outermost apparent horizon of a $4$-dimensional asymptotically flat\nmanifold with non-negative scalar curvature, whose ADM mass can be arranged to\nbe arbitrarily close to the optimal value specified by the Riemannian Penrose\ninequality; (ii) any metric $g$ with positive scalar curvature on the\n$n$-sphere $S^n$, with $ n \\ge 4 $, such that $(S^n, g)$ isometrically embeds\ninto $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ as a star-shaped hypersurface, can be realized as the\ninduced metric on the outermost apparent horizon of an $(n+1)$-dimensional\nasymptotically flat manifold with non-negative scalar curvature, whose ADM mass\ncan be made to be arbitrarily close to the optimal value.\n", "  While restricted single-reference coupled cluster theory truncated to singles\nand doubles (CCSD) provides very accurate results for weakly correlated\nsystems, it usually fails in the presence of static or strong correlation. This\nfailure is generally attributed to the qualitative breakdown of the reference,\nand can accordingly be corrected by using a multi-determinant reference,\nincluding higher-body cluster operators in the ansatz, or allowing symmetry\nbreaking in the reference. None of these solutions are ideal; multi-reference\ncoupled cluster is not black box, including higher-body cluster operators is\ncomputationally demanding, and allowing symmetry breaking leads to the loss of\ngood quantum numbers. It has long been recognized that quasidegeneracies can\ninstead be treated by modifying the coupled cluster ansatz. The recently\nintroduced pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) approach is one such example\nwhich avoids catastrophic failures and accurately models strong correlations in\na symmetry-adapted framework. Here we generalize pCCD to a singlet-paired\ncoupled cluster model (CCD0) intermediate between coupled cluster doubles and\npCCD, yielding a method that possesses the invariances of the former and much\nof the stability of the latter. Moreover, CCD0 retains the full structure of\ncoupled cluster theory, including a fermionic wave function, antisymmetric\ncluster amplitudes, and well-defined response equations and density matrices.\n", "  Quantum mechanics exhibits a wide range of nonclassical features, of which\nentanglement in multipartite systems takes a central place. In several specific\nsettings, it is well known that nonclassicality (e.g., squeezing, spin\nsqueezing, coherence) can be converted into entanglement. In this work, we\npresent a general framework, based on superposition, for structurally\nconnecting and converting nonclassicality to entanglement. In addition to\ncapturing the previously known results, this framework also allows us to\nuncover new entanglement convertibility theorems in two broad scenarios, one\nwhich is discrete and one which is continuous. In the discrete setting, the\nclassical states can be any finite linearly independent set. For the continuous\nsetting, the pertinent classical states are 'symmetric coherent states,'\nconnected with symmetric representations of the group SU(K). These results\ngeneralize and link convertibility properties from the resource theory of\ncoherence, spin coherent states, and optical coherent states, while also\nrevealing important connections between local and nonlocal pictures of\nnonclassicality.\n", "  A new Digital Pulse Processing (DPP) module has been developed, based on a\ndomino ring sampler version 4 chip (DRS4), with good time resolution for LaBr3\ndetectors, and different digital timing analysis methods for processing the raw\ndetector signals are reported. The module, composed of an eight channel DRS4\nchip, was used as the readout electronic and acquisition system to process the\noutput signals from XP20D0 Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs). Two PMTs were coupled\nwith LaBr3 scintillator and placed face to face on both sides of a radioactive\npositron 22Na source for 511 keV gama ray tests. By analyzing the raw data\nacquired by the module, the best coincidence timing resolution is about 194.7\nps (FWHM), obtained by the digital constant fraction discrimination (dCFD)\nmethod, which is better than other digital methods and analysis methods based\non conventional analog systems which have been tested. The results indicate\nthat it is a promising approach to better localize the positron annihilation in\npositron emission tomography (PET) with time of flight (TOF), as well as for\nscintillation timing measurement, such as in TOF-DeltaE and TOF-E systems for\nparticle identification, with picosecond accuracy timing measurement.\nFurthermore, this module is more simple and convenient than other systems.\n", "  In the recent years, the multilayer networks have increasingly been realized\nas a more realistic framework to understand emergent physical phenomena in\ncomplex real world systems. We analyze a massive time-varying social data drawn\nfrom the largest film industry of the world under multilayer network framework.\nThe framework enables us to evaluate the versatility of actors, which turns out\nto be an intrinsic property of lead actors. Versatility in dimers suggests that\nworking with different types of nodes are more beneficial than with similar\nones. However, the triangles yield a different relation between type of\nco-actor and the success of lead nodes indicating the importance of higher\norder motifs in understanding the properties of the underlying system.\nFurthermore, despite the degree-degree correlations of entire networks being\nneutral, multilayering picks up different values of correlation indicating\npositive connotations like trust, in the recent years. Analysis of weak ties of\nthe industry uncovers nodes from lower degree regime being important in linking\nBollywood clusters. The framework and the tools used herein may be used for\nunraveling the complexity of other real world systems.\n", "  We propose a projector-based renormalization framework to study\nexciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensation in a microcavity matter-light\nsystem. Treating Coulomb interaction and electron-hole/photon coupling effects\non an equal footing we analyze the ground-state properties of the exciton\npolariton model according to the detuning and the excitation density. We\ndemonstrate that the condensate by its nature shows a crossover from an\nexcitonic insulator (of Bose-Einstein respectively BCS type) to a polariton and\nfinally photonic condensed state as the excitation density increases at large\ndetuning. If the detuning is weak polariton or photonic phases dominate. While\nin both cases a notable renormalization of the quasiparticle band structure\noccurs that strongly affects the coherent part of the excitonic luminescence,\nthe incoherent wavevector-resolved luminescence spectrum develops a flat bottom\nonly for small detuning.\n", "  In 2013 the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Francois Englert and Peter\nHiggs for their development in 1964 of the mass generation mechanism (the Higgs\nmechanism) in local gauge theories. This mechanism requires the existence of a\nmassive scalar particle, the Higgs boson, and in 2012 the Higgs boson was\nfinally observed at the Large Hadron Collider after being sought for almost\nhalf a century. In this pedagogical article we review the work of these Nobel\nrecipients and discuss its implications. We approach the topic from the\nperspective of a dynamically generated Higgs boson that is a\nfermion-antifermion bound state rather than an elementary field that appears in\nan input Lagrangian. In particular, we emphasize the connection with the BCS\ntheory of superconductivity. We identify the double-well Higgs potential not as\na fundamental potential but as a mean-field effective Lagrangian with a\ndynamical Higgs boson being generated through a residual interaction that\naccompanies the mean-field Lagrangian. We discuss what we believe to be the key\nchallenge raised by the discovery of the Higgs boson, namely determining\nwhether it is elementary or composite, and suggest that the width of the Higgs\nboson might serve as a suitable diagnostic for discriminating between an\nelementary Higgs boson and a composite one.\n", "  We report the first experimental realization of orbital two-channel Kondo\n(2CK) effect from two-level systems (TLSs) in epitaxial L10-MnAl films with\ngiant perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The resistivity exhibits a\nlow-temperature (T) upturn with a clear transition from a lnT-dependence to\nT1/2-dependence and deviation from it in three distinct T regimes, which are\nindependent of applied magnetic fields. The magnitudes of Kondo temperature and\nenergy splitting of the TLSs are greatly enhanced in comparison to those in\nother systems exhibiting orbital 2CK, suggesting strong coupling between the\ntunneling centers with conduction electrons via resonant scattering. These\nresults point to a considerable robustness of the orbital 2CK effect even in\nthe presence of ferromagnetic ordering and significant spin polarization of the\nconduction electrons.\n", "  Important tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics include the generation and\ncontrol of quantum states of spatially-separated particles distributed in\ndifferent cavities. An interesting question in this context is how to prepare\nentanglement among particles located in different cavities, which are important\nfor large-scale quantum information processing. We here consider a multi-cavity\nsystem where cavities are coupled to a superconducting (SC) qubit and each\ncavity hosts many SC qubits. We show that all intra-cavity SC qubits plus the\ncoupler SC qubit can be prepared in an entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger\n(GHZ) state, by using a single operation and without the need of measurements.\nThe GHZ state is created without exciting the cavity modes; thus greatly\nsuppressing the decoherence caused by the cavity-photon decay and the effect of\nunwanted inter-cavity crosstalk on the operation. We also introduce two simple\nmethods for entangling the intra-cavity SC qubits in a GHZ state. As an\nexample, our numerical simulations show that it is feasible, with current\ncircuit-QED technology, to prepare high-fidelity GHZ states, for up to nine SC\nqubits by using SC qubits distributed in two cavities. This proposal can in\nprinciple be used to implement a GHZ state for {\\it an arbitrary number} of SC\nqubits distributed in multiple cavities. The proposal is quite general and can\nbe applied to a wide range of physical systems, with the intra-cavity qubits\nbeing either atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, or various SC qubits.\n", "  Redshift-space distortions are generally considered in the plane parallel\nlimit, where the angular separation between the two sources can be neglected.\nGiven that galaxy catalogues now cover large fractions of the sky, it becomes\nnecessary to consider them in a formalism which takes into account the wide\nangle separations. In this article we derive an operational formula for the\nmatter correlators in the Newtonian limit to be used in actual data sets, both\nin configuration and in Fourier spaces without relying on a plane-parallel\napproximation. We then recover the plane-parallel limit not only in\nconfiguration space where the geometry is simpler, but also in Fourier space,\nand we exhibit the first corrections that should be included in large surveys\nas a perturbative expansion over the plane-parallel results. We finally compare\nour results to existing literature, and show explicitly how they are related.\n", "  A first principles many-body approach is employed to calculate the band\nstructure and optical response of nanometer sized ribbons of SiC. Many-body\neffects are incorporated using the GW approximation, and excitonic effects are\nincluded using the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Both unpassivated and hydrogen\npassivated armchair SiC nanoribbons are studied. As a consequence of low\ndimensionality, large quasiparticle corrections are seen to the Kohn-Sham\nenergy gaps. In both cases quasiparticle band gaps are increased by up to 2 eV,\nas compared to their Kohn-Sham energy values. Inclusion of electron-hole\ninteractions modifies the absorption spectra significantly, giving rise to\nstrongly bound excitonic peaks in these systems.The results suggest that\nhydrogen-passivated armchair SiC nanoribbons have the potential to be used in\noptoelectronic devices operating in the UV-Vis region of the spectrum. We also\ncompute the formation energies of these nanoribbons as a function of their\nwidths, and conclude that hydrogen-saturated ribbons will be much more stable\nas compared to the bare ones.\n", "  We study the coherent mixing between two-particle (single exciton) and\nfour-particle (biexciton) states of a semiconductor nanocrystal resulting from\nthe coulomb coupling between states with different numbers of electron-hole\npairs. Using a simple model of the nanocrystal wave functions and an envelope\nfunction approach, we estimate the efficiency of the multiple exciton\ngeneration (MEG) process resulting from such coherent admixture mechanism,\nincluding all the relevant states in a very broad energy interval. We show that\nin a typical ensemble of nanocrystals with 3~nm average radius, the onset of\nthe MEG process appears about 1~eV above the lower edge of the biexciton\ndensity of states and the efficiency of the process reaches 50\\% for photon\nenergies around 5~eV. The MEG onset shifts to lower energies and the efficiency\nincreases as the radius grows. We point out that the energy dependence of the\nMEG efficiency differs considerably between ensembles with small and large\ninhomogeneity of nancrystal sizes.\n", "  The effects of compressibility on Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) are\ninvestigated by inspecting the interplay between thermodynamic and hydrodynamic\nnon-equilibrium phenomena (TNE, HNE, respectively) via a discrete Boltzmann\nmodel (DBM). Two effective approaches are presented, one tracking the evolution\nof the \\emph{local} TNE effects and the other focussing on the evolution of the\nmean temperature of the fluid, to track the complex interfaces separating the\nbubble and the spike regions of the flow. It is found that, both the\ncompressibility effects and the \\emph{global} TNE intensity show opposite\ntrends in the initial and the later stages of the RTI. Compressibility delays\nthe initial stage of RTI and accelerates the later stage. Meanwhile, the TNE\ncharacteristics are generally enhanced by the compressibility, especially in\nthe later stage. The global or mean thermodynamic non-equilibrium indicators\nprovide physical criteria to discriminate between the two stages of the RTI.\n", "  We investigate the optimization of synchronizability in multiplex networks\nand demonstrate that the interlayer coupling strength is the deciding factor\nfor the efficiency of optimization. The optimized networks have homogeneity in\nthe degree as well as in the betweenness centrality. Additionally, the\ninterlayer coupling strength crucially affects various properties of individual\nlayers in the optimized multiplex networks. We provide an understanding to how\nthe emerged network properties are shaped or affected when the evolution\nrenders them better synchronizable.\n", "  The time evolution of random variables with L\\'evy statistics has the ability\nto develop jumps, displaying very different behaviors from continuously\nfluctuating cases. Such patterns appear in an ever broadening range of examples\nincluding random lasers, non-Gaussian kinetics or foraging strategies. The\npenalizing or reinforcing effect of the environment, however, has been little\nexplored so far. We report a new phenomenon which manifests as a qualitative\ntransition in the spatial decay behavior of the stationary measure of a jump\nprocess under an external potential, occurring on a combined change in the\ncharacteristics of the process and the lowest eigenvalue resulting from the\neffect of the potential. This also provides insight into the fundamental\nquestion of what is the mechanism of the spatial decay of a ground state.\n", "  A dc electron gun, generating picosecond pulses with up to $8\\times10^{6}$\nelectrons per pulse, was developed. Its applicability for future\ntime-resolved-diffraction experiments on state- and conformer-selected\nlaser-aligned or oriented gaseous samples was characterized. The focusing\nelectrodes were arranged in a velocity-map imaging spectrometer configuration.\nThis allowed to directly measure the spatial and velocity distributions of the\nelectron pulses emitted from the cathode. The coherence length and pulse\nduration of the electron beam were characterized by these measurements combined\nwith electron trajectory simulations. Electron diffraction data off a thin\naluminum foil illustrated the coherence and resolution of the electron-gun\nsetup.\n", "  We study the dependence of the formation energies of oxygen and metal induced\ndefects in Ta2O5, TaO2, TaO, TiO2 and Ti4O7 on the chemical potential of\nelectron and atomic constitutes. In the study of single defect, metal induced\ndefects are found to be preferable to oxygen induced defects. This is against\nthe experimental fact of the dominant role of oxygen induced defects in the RS\nprocess. A simple multiple defects picture without correlated atomic\nrearrangement does not cure this problem. The problem is resolved under the\ncorrelated multiple defect picture where the multiple defects result in\ncorrelated atomic rearrangement and the final products show certain atomic\nordering.\n", "  A new transient effective theory of the relativistic Boltzmann equation is\nderived for locally momentum-anisotropic systems. In the expansion of the\ndistribution function around a local \"quasi-equilibrium\" state a\nnon-hydrodynamic dynamical degree of freedom is introduced at leading order\nthat breaks local momentum isotropy. By replacing the deviation of the\ndistribution function from this quasi-equilibrium state in terms of moments of\nthe leading-order distribution and applying a systematic power counting scheme\nthat orders the non-hydrodynamic modes by their microscopic time scales, a\nclosed set of equations for the dynamical degrees of freedom is obtained.\nTruncating this set at the level of the slowest non-hydroynamic mode we find\nthat it exhibits transient oscillatory behavior -- a phenomenon previously\nfound only in strongly coupled theories, where it appears to be generic. In\nweakly coupled systems described by the Boltzmann equation, these transient\noscillations depend on the breaking of local momentum isotropy being treated\nnon-perturbatively at leading order in the expansion of the distribution\nfunction.\n", "  The average time $T$ required for high-fidelity readout of quantum states can\nbe significantly reduced via a real-time adaptive decision rule. An adaptive\ndecision rule stops the readout as soon as a desired level of confidence has\nbeen achieved, as opposed to setting a fixed readout time $t_f$. The\nperformance of the adaptive decision is characterized by the \"adaptive-decision\nspeedup,\" $t_f/T$. In this work, we reformulate this readout problem in terms\nof the first-passage time of a particle undergoing stochastic motion. This\nformalism allows us to theoretically establish the maximum achievable\nadaptive-decision speedups for several physical two-state readout\nimplementations. We show that for two common readout schemes (the Gaussian\nlatching readout and a readout relying on state-dependent decay), the speedup\nis bounded by $4$ and $2$, respectively, in the limit of high single-shot\nreadout fidelity. We experimentally study the achievable speedup in a\nreal-world scenario by applying the adaptive decision rule to a readout of the\nnitrogen-vacancy-center (NV-center) charge state. We find a speedup of $\\approx\n2$ with our experimental parameters. In addition, we propose a simple readout\nscheme for which the speedup can, in principle, be increased without bound as\nthe fidelity is increased. Our results should lead to immediate improvements in\nnanoscale magnetometry based on spin-to-charge conversion of the NV-center\nspin, and provide a theoretical framework for further optimization of the\nbandwidth of quantum measurements.\n", "  We describe several results concerning global quantum quenches from states\nwith short-range correlations to quantum critical points whose low-energy\nproperties are described by a 1+1-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT),\nextending the work of Calabrese and Cardy (2006): (a) for the special class of\ninitial states discussed in that paper we show that, once a finite region falls\ninside the horizon, its reduced density matrix is exponentially close in $L_2$\nnorm to that of a thermal Gibbs state; (b) small deformations of this initial\nstate in general lead to a (non-Abelian) generalized Gibbs distribution (GGE)\nwith, however, the possibility of parafermionic conserved charges; (c) small\ndeformations of the CFT, corresponding to curvature of the dispersion relation\nand (non-integrable) left-right scattering, lead to a dependence of the speed\nof propagation on the initial state, as well as diffusive broadening of the\nhorizon.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) intrinsic ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors are crucial\nto develop low-dimensional spintronic devices. Using density functional theory,\nwe show that single-layer chromium trihalides (SLCTs) (CrX$_3$,X=F, Cl, Br and\nI) constitute a series of stable 2D intrinsic FM semiconductors. A\nfree-standing SLCT can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal, due to a low\ncleavage energy and a high in-plane stiffness. Electronic structure\ncalculations using the HSE06 functional indicate that both bulk and\nsingle-layer CrX$_3$ are half semiconductors with indirect gaps and their\nvalence bands and conduction bands are fully spin-polarized in the same spin\ndirection. The energy gaps and absorption edges of CrBr$_3$ and CrI$_3$ are\nfound to be in the visible frequency range, which implies possible\nopt-electronic applications. Furthermore, SLCTs are found to possess a large\nmagnetic moment of 3$\\mu_B$ per formula unit and a sizable magnetic anisotropy\nenergy. The magnetic exchange constants of SLCTs are then extracted using the\nHeisenberg spin Hamiltonian and the microscopic origins of the various exchange\ninteractions are analyzed. A competition between a near 90$^\\circ$ FM\nsuperexchange and a direct antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange results in a FM\nnearest-neighbour exchange interaction. The next and third nearest-neighbour\nexchange interactions are found to be FM and AFM respectively and this can be\nunderstood by the angle-dependent extended Cr-X-X-Cr superexchange interaction.\nMoreover, the Curie temperatures of SLCTs are also predicted using Monte Carlo\nsimulations and the values can further increase by applying a biaxial tensile\nstrain. The unique combination of robust intrinsic ferromagnetism, half\nsemiconductivity and large magnetic anisotropy energies renders the SLCTs as\npromising candidates for next-generation semiconductor spintronic applications.\n", "  An elastic layer slides on a rigid flat governed by Coulomb's friction law.\nWe demonstrate that if the coefficient of friction is high enough, the sliding\nlocalizes within stick-slip pulses, which transform into opening waves\npropagating at intersonic speed in the direction of sliding or, for high\nPoisson's ratios, at supersonic speed in the opposite direction. This sliding\nmode, characterized by marginal frictional dissipation, and similar to carpet\nfold propagation, may result in inversion of the frictional force direction; at\nlonger time intervals the system demonstrates stick-slip behavior. The\nmechanism is described in detail and a parametric study is presented.\n", "  Laser spectroscopy of cold and trapped molecular ions is a powerful tool for\nfundamental physics, including the determination of fundamental constants, the\nlaboratory test for their possible variation, and the search for a possible\nelectric dipole moment of the electron. Optical clocks based on molecular ions\nsensitive to some of these effects are expected to achieve uncertainties\napproaching the $10^{-18}$ level. While the complexity of molecular structure\nfacilitates these applications, the absence of cycling transitions poses a\nchallenge for direct laser cooling, quantum state control, and detection.\nPreviously employed state detection techniques based on photo-dissociation or\nchemical reactions are destructive and therefore inefficient. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate non-destructive state detection of a single trapped\nmolecular ion through its strong Coulomb coupling to a well-controlled\nco-trapped atomic ion. An algorithm based on a state-dependent optical dipole\nforce(ODF) changes the internal state of the atom conditioned on the internal\nstate of the molecule. We show that individual states in the molecule can be\ndistinguished by their coupling strength to the ODF and observe black-body\nradiation-induced quantum jumps between rotational states. Using the detuning\ndependence of the state detection signal, we implement a variant of quantum\nlogic spectroscopy and improve upon a previous measurement of the\n$\\mathrm{X}^1\\Sigma^+(J=1)\\rightarrow\\mathrm{A}^1\\Sigma^+(J=0)$ transition in\nMgH, finding a frequency of 1067.74752(53)THz. We estimate that non-destructive\nstate detection with near 100% efficiency could take less than 10 ms. The\ntechnique we demonstrate is applicable to a wide range of molecular ions,\nenabling further applications in state-controlled quantum chemistry and\nspectroscopic investigations of molecules serving as probes for interstellar\nclouds.\n", "  We propose a novel mechanism enabling us to have a continuum bump as a\nsignature of gamma-ray excess in indirect detection experiments of dark matter\n(DM), postulating a generic dark sector having (at least) two DM candidates.\nWith the assumption of non-zero mass gap between the two DM candidates, the\nheavier one directly communicates to the partner of the lighter one. Such a\npartner then decays into a lighter DM particle along with an \"axion-like\"\nparticle (ALP) or dark \"pion\", which subsequently decays into a pair of\nphotons, via a more-than-one step cascade decay process. Since the cascade is\ninitiated by the dark partner obtaining a non-trivial fixed boost factor, a\ncontinuum gamma-ray energy spectrum naturally arises even with a particle\ndirectly decaying into two photons. We apply the main idea to the energy\nspectrum of the GeV gamma-rays from around the Galactic Center (GC), and find\nthat the relevant observational data is well-reproduced by the theory\nexpectation predicted by the proposed mechanism. Remarkably, the relevant\nenergy spectrum has a robust peak at half the mass of the ALP or dark pion, as\nopposed to popular DM models directly annihilating to Standard Model particles\nwhere physical interpretations of the energy peak are not manifest. Our data\nanalysis reports substantially improved fits, compared to those annihilating DM\nmodels, and ~900 MeV mass of the ALP or dark pion.\n", "  A logarithm processing algorithm to measure beam transverse size and position\nis proposed and preliminary experimental results in Hefei Light Source II (HLS\nII) are given. The algorithm is based on only 4 successive channels of 16 anode\nchannels of multianode photomultiplier tube (MAPMT) R5900U-00-L16 which has\ntypical rise time of 0.6 ns and effective area of 0.8x16 mm for a single anode\nchannel. In the paper, we firstly elaborate the simulation results of the\nalgorithm with and without channel inconsistency. Then we calibrate the channel\ninconsistency and verify the algorithm using general current signal processor\nLibera Photon in low-speed scheme. Finally we get turn-by-turn beam size and\nposition and calculate the vertical tune in high-speed scheme. The experimental\nresults show that measured values fit well with simulation results after\nchannel differences are calibrated and the fractional part of the tune in\nvertical direction is 0.3628 which is very close to the nominal value 0.3621.\n", "  We stabilize the idler frequency of a singly-resonant optical parametric\noscillator directly to the resonance of a mid-infrared Fabry-P\\'erot reference\ncavity. This is accomplished by the Pound-Drever-Hall locking scheme,\ncontrolling either the pump laser or the resonant signal frequency. A residual\nrelative frequency noise power spectral density below 10$^3$ Hz$^2$/Hz is\nreached, with a Gaussian linewidth of 920 Hz over 100 ms, which demonstrates\nthe potential for reaching spectral purity down to the Hz level by locking the\noptical parametric oscillator against a mid-infrared cavity with\nstate-of-the-art superior performance.\n", "  Three types of surface tensions can be defined for lipid membranes: the\ninternal tension, $\\sigma$, conjugated to the real membrane area in the\nHamiltonian, the mechanical frame tension, $\\tau$, conjugated to the projected\narea, and the \"fluctuation tension\", $r$, obtained from the fluctuation\nspectrum of the membrane height.\n  We investigate these surface tensions by means of a Monge gauge lattice Monte\nCarlo simulation involving the exact, nonlinear, Helfrich Hamiltonian and a\nmeasure correction for excess entropy of the Monge gauge. Our results for the\nrelation between $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ agrees well with the theoretical\nprediction of [J.-B. Fournier and C. Barbetta, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008, 100,\n078103] based on a Gaussian approximation. This provides a valuable knowledge\nof~$\\tau$ in the standard Gaussian models where the tension is controlled by\n$\\sigma$. However, contrary to the conjecture in the above paper, we find that\n$r$ exhibits no significant difference from $\\tau$ over more than five decades\nof tension. Our results appear to be valid in the thermodynamic limit and are\nrobust to changing the ensemble in which the membrane area is controlled.\n", "  In the past few years there has been a significant rise in the short-circuit\ncurrent levels in transmission and distribution networks, it due to the\nincreasing demands on power and the addition of sources of distributed\ngenerations. It leads to the need of integration of novel protection systems\nsuch as the superconducting fault current limiters (SFCLs), ... . SFCL models\non the electric distribution networks largely rely on the insertion of a step\nor exponential resistance that is determined by a predefined quenching time.\nHowever, beyond the framework of these models, the study of the performance,\nreliability, and location strategy for the installation of sole or multiple\nSFCLs in power grids still lacks of proper development leading to the utter\nneed of comprehensive and systematic studies on this issue. In this paper, we\nexpand the scope of the aforementioned models by considering the actual\nbehaviour of a SFCL in terms of the temperature dynamic power-law dependence\nbetween the electrical field and the current density. Our results are compared\nwith step-resistance models for the sake of discussion and clarity of the\nconclusions. Both SFCL models were integrated into a power system model built\nbased on the UK power standard, and the impact of these protection strategies\non the performance of the overall electricity network was studied. As a\nrepresentative renewable energy source, a 90 MVA wind farm was considered for\nthe simulations. Three fault conditions have been simulated, and the figures\nfor the fault current reduction predicted by both fault current limiting models\nhave been compared in terms of multiple current measuring points and allocation\nstrategies...\n", "  Because spatio-temporal tensors are associated with the Lorentz group,\nwhereas spinors are associated with its covering group SL(2, C), one can\nassociate with every tensor a spinor (but not vice versa). In particular, the\n(1,0)+(0,1) representation of SL(2, C) can provide a six-component spinor\nequivalent to the electromagnetic field tensor. The chief aim of this work is\nto develop the (1,0)+(0,1) description for the electromagnetic field in the\nabsence of sources, rigorously and systematically, which should be useful if we\nare to deal with those issues involving with single-photon states and the\nangular momentum of light, etc. Based on our formalism, the quantum theory and\nsome symmetries of the photon field can be discussed in a new manner, and the\nspin-orbit interaction of photons can be described in a form that is closely\nanalogous to that of the Dirac electron. Moreover, in terms of the (1,0)+(0,1)\ndescription, one can treat the photon field in curved spacetime via spin\nconnection and the tetrad formalism, which is of great advantage to study the\ngravitational spin-orbit coupling of photons.\n", "  Inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) is an important tool for studies of\nequilibrium dynamics in condensed matter. A new spectrometer recently proposed\nfor ultra-high-resolution IXS (UHRIX) has achieved 0.6~meV and 0.25~nm$^{-1}$\nspectral and momentum transfer resolutions, respectively. However, further\nimprovements down to 0.1~meV and 0.02~nm$^{-1}$ are required to close the gap\nin energy-momentum space between high and low frequency probes. We show that\nthis goal can be achieved by further optimizing the X-ray optics and by\nincreasing the spectral flux of the incident X-ray pulses. UHRIX performs best\nat energies from 5 to 10 keV, where a combination of self-seeding and undulator\ntapering at the SASE-2 beamline of the European XFEL promises up to a\nhundred-fold increase in average spectral flux compared with nominal SASE\npulses at saturation, or three orders of magnitude more than possible with\nstorage-ring based radiation sources. Wave-optics propagation shows that about\n$7\\times 10^{12}$~ph/s in a $90$-$\\mu$eV bandwidth can be achieved on the\nsample. This will provide unique new possibilities for dynamics studies by IXS.\n", "  Auger-ionized carriers in a one-dimensional semiconductor are predicted to\nresult in a strong band-gap renormalization. Isolated single-walled carbon\nnanotubes (SWCNT) under high-intensity laser irradiation exhibit strong\nnonlinear photoluminescence (PL) due to exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA). The\npresence of exciton disassociation during the rapid Auger-ionization caused by\nEEA would lead to a strong nonlinear absorption. By simultaneously measuring\nSWCNT PL and optical absorption of isolated SWCNT clusters in the PL saturation\nregime, we give evidence that Auger-ionized excitons do not disassociate but\nremain bound.\n", "  We prove that the existence of a Haantjes structure is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a Hamiltonian system to be integrable in the\nLiouville-Arnold sense. This structure, expressed in terms of suitable\noperators whose Haantjes torsion vanishes, encodes the main features of the\nnotion of integrability, and in particular, under certain hypotheses, allows to\nsolve the problem of determining separation of variables for a given system in\nan algorithmic way.\n  As an application of the theory, we prove theorems ensuring the existence of\na large class of completely integrable systems in the Euclidean plane,\nconstructed starting from a prescribed Haantjes structure. At the same time, we\nalso show that some of the most classical examples of Hamiltonian systems in n\ndimensions, as for instance the Gantmacher and St\\\"ackel classes, all possess a\nnatural Haantjes structure.\n", "  We perform the full Hamiltonian analysis of the topological BFCG action based\non the Poincare 2-group. The Hamiltonian of the theory is constructed, and the\nalgebra of constraints is computed. The Dirac brackets are evaluated, and the\nsecond class constraints are then eliminated from the theory. The results are\ncontrasted to those of the topological Poincare gauge theory, which is\nequivalent to the BFCG model at the level of the classical action, but has a\nvery different Hamiltonian structure.\n", "  We report the detection of a rare transiting brown dwarf with a mass of 59\nM_Jup and radius of 1.1 R_Jup around the metal-rich, [Fe/H] = +0.44, G9V star\nCoRoT-33. The orbit is eccentric (e = 0.07) with a period of 5.82 d. The\ncompanion, CoRoT-33b, is thus a new member in the so-called brown dwarf desert.\nThe orbital period is within 3% to a 3:2 resonance with the rotational period\nof the star. CoRoT-33b may be an important test case for tidal evolution\nstudies. The true frequency of brown dwarfs close to their host stars (P < 10\nd) is estimated to be approximately 0.2% which is about six times smaller than\nthe frequency of hot Jupiters in the same period range. We suspect that the\nfrequency of brown dwarfs declines faster with decreasing period than that of\ngiant planets.\n", "  Although liquid water has been studied for many decades by (X-ray and\nneutron) diffraction measurements, new experimental results keep appearing,\nvirtually every year. The reason for this is that neither X-ray, nor neutron\ndiffraction data are trivial to correct and interpret for this essential\nsubstance. Since X-rays are somewhat insensitive to hydrogen, neutron\ndiffraction with (most frequently, H/D) isotopic substitution is vital for\ninvestigating the most important feature in water: hydrogen bonding. Here, the\ntwo very recent sets of neutron diffraction data are considered, both\nexploiting the contrast between light and heavy hydrogen, $^1$H and $^2$H, in\ndifferent ways. Reverse Monte Carlo structural modeling is applied for\nconstructing large structural models that are as consistent as possible with\nall experimental information, both in real and reciprocal space. The method has\nalso proven to be useful for revealing where possible small inconsistencies\nappear during primary data processing: for one neutron data set, it is the\nmolecular geometry that may not be maintained within reasonable limits, whereas\nfor the other set, it is one of the (composite) radial distribution functions\nthat cannot be modeled at the same (high) level as the other three functions.\nNevertheless, details of the local structure around the hydrogen bonds appear\nvery much the same for both data sets: the most probable hydrogen bond angle is\nstraight, and the nearest oxygen neighbours of a central oxygen atom occupy\napproximately tetrahedral positions.\n", "  We present an unique way to detect basepair mismatches in DNA leading to\ndifferent epigenetic disorder by the method of nanopore sequencing. Based on a\ntight-binding formulation of graphene nanopore based device, using Greens\nfunction approach we measure the changes in the electronic transport properties\nof the device as we translocate a double-stranded DNA through the nanopore\nembeded in a zigzag graphene nanoribbon. In the present work we not only\nsuccessfully detect the usual AT and GC pairs, but also a set of possible\nmismatches in the complementary base-pairing without any ambiguity. Our\ninvestigation shows that this device can also be used for reliable sequential\ndetection of other biomolecules.\n", "  We propose the integrable N-dimensional Calogero-Coulomb-Stark and two-center\nCalogero-Coulomb systems and construct their constants of motion via the Dunkl\noperators. Their Schr\\\"odinger equations decouple in parabolic and elliptic\ncoordinates into the set of three differential equations like for the\nCoulomb-Stark and two-center Coulomb problems. The Calogero term preserves the\nenergy levels, but changes their degrees of degeneracy.\n", "  We describe the entanglement of two indistinguishable delocalized\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles in the simplest spatial configuration of three\nspatial modes with the constraint that at most one particle occupy each mode.\nIt is show that this is the only number of modes for which maximally entangled\nstates exist in such a system. The set of entangled states, including the set\nof maximally entangled states, is described and different types of entanglement\nin terms of Bell-nonlocal correlations for different partitions of the system\nare identified. In particular we focus on the entangled states that are\nBell-local for a tri-partition of the system and cannot be described as a\nsuperposition of bi-partite entangled pairs of localized particles. Two\nentanglement invariants are constructed and it is shown that all entanglement\nmonotones are functions of these. Furthermore, the system has a generic\nnon-trivial local unitary symmetry with a corresponding $2\\pi/3$ fractional\ntopological phase. In addition to this a necessary and sufficient condition for\nthe existence of maximally entangled states in systems of arbitrary numbers of\ndelocalized particles with arbitrary spin, where at most one particle can\noccupy each mode, is derived.\n", "  In this paper we determine those bijective maps of the set of all positive\ndefinite $n\\times n$ complex matrices which preserve a given Bregman divergence\ncorresponding to a differentiable convex function that satisfies certain\nconditions. We cover the cases of the most important Bregman divergences and\npresent the precise structure of the mentioned transformations. Similar results\nconcerning Jensen divergences and their preservers are also given.\n", "  A potential model for the interaction between a charmed baryon ($\\Lambda_c$,\n$\\Sigma_c$, and $\\Sigma_c^*$) and the nucleon ($N$) is constructed. The model\ncontains a long-range meson ($\\pi$ and $\\sigma$) exchange part and a\nshort-distance quark exchange part. The quark cluster model is used to evaluate\nthe short-range repulsion and a monopole type form factor is introduced to the\nlong-range potential to reflect the extended structure of hadrons. We determine\nthe cutoff parameters in the form factors by fitting the $NN$ scattering data\nwith the same approach and we obtain four sets of parameters (a -- d). The most\nattractive potential (d) leads to bound $\\Lambda_c N$ states with $J^\\pi= 0^+$\nand $1^+$ once the channel couplings among $\\Lambda_c$, $\\Sigma_c$ and\n$\\Sigma_c^*$ are taken into account. One can also investigate many-body\nproblems with the model. Here, we construct an effective $\\Lambda_c N$\none-channel potential with the parameter set (d) and apply it to the 3-body\n$\\Lambda_c NN$ system. The bound states with $J=1/2$ and $3/2$ are predicted.\n", "  In a recent interesting article A. Heuer, G. Pieplow, and R. Menzel discuss a\nquantum-eraser experiment to investigate the complementarity of wave-like and\nparticle-like behavior of photons. I would like to draw your attention to the\nfact that the very same experimental setup was suggested in a previous paper,\nand take advantage of this opportunity to examine some aspects of this\ncontroversial subject.\n", "  We demonstrate single-qubit operations by transporting a beryllium ion with a\ncontrolled velocity through a stationary laser beam. We use these to perform\ncoherent sequences of quantum operations, and to perform parallel quantum logic\ngates on two ions in different processing zones of a multiplexed ion trap chip\nusing a single recycled laser beam. For the latter, we demonstrate individually\naddressed single-qubit gates by local control of the speed of each ion. The\nfidelities we observe are consistent with operations performed using standard\nmethods involving static ions and pulsed laser fields. This work therefore\nprovides a path to scalable ion trap quantum computing with reduced\nrequirements on the optical control complexity.\n", "  The recently discovered (Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$)OHFeSe superconductor provides\na new platform for exploiting the microscopic mechanisms of high-$T_c$\nsuperconductivity in FeSe-derived systems. Using density functional theory\ncalculations, we first show that substitution of Li by Fe not only\nsignificantly strengthens the attraction between the (Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$)OH\nspacing layers and the FeSe superconducting layers along the \\emph{c} axis, but\nalso minimizes the lattice mismatch between the two in the \\emph{ab} plane,\nboth favorable for stabilizing the overall structure. Next we explore the\nelectron injection into FeSe from the spacing layers, and unambiguously\nidentify the Fe$_{0.2}$ components to be the dominant atomic origin of the\ndramatically enhanced interlayer charge transfer. We further reveal that the\nsystem strongly favors collinear antiferromagnetic ordering in the FeSe layers,\nbut the spacing layers can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic\ndepending on the Fe$_{0.2}$ spatial distribution. Based on these\nunderstandings, we also predict (Li$_{0.8}$Co$_{0.2}$)OHFeSe to be structurally\nstable with even larger electron injection and potentially higher $T_c$.\n", "  We analyze the spectrum of harmonic flow, $v_n(p_T)$ for $n=0\\text{--}5$, in\nevent-by-event hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Large\nHadron Collider ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\\,{\\text{TeV}}$) with principal component\nanalysis (PCA). The PCA procedure finds two dominant contributions to the\ntwo-particle correlation function. The leading component is identified with the\nevent plane $v_n(p_T)$, while the subleading component is responsible for\nfactorization breaking in hydrodynamics. For $v_0$, $v_1$, and $v_3$ the\nsubleading flow is a response to the radial excitation of the corresponding\neccentricity. By contrast, for $v_2$ the subleading flow in \\emph{peripheral\ncollisions} is dominated by the nonlinear mixing between the leading elliptic\nflow and radial flow fluctuations. In the $v_2$ case, the sub-sub-leading mode\nmore closely reflects the response to the radial excitation of $\\varepsilon_2$.\nA consequence of this picture is that the elliptic flow fluctuations and\nfactorization breaking change rapidly with centrality, and in central\ncollisions (where the leading $v_2$ is small and nonlinear effects can be\nneglected) the subsub-leading mode becomes important. Radial flow fluctuations\nand nonlinear mixing also play a significant role in the factorization breaking\nof $v_4$ and $v_5$. We construct good geometric predictors for the orientation\nand magnitudes of the leading and subleading flows based on a linear response\nto the geometry, and a quadratic mixing between the leading principal\ncomponents. Finally, we suggest a set of measurements involving three point\ncorrelations which can experimentally corroborate the nonlinear mixing of\nradial and elliptic flow and its important contribution to factorization\nbreaking as a function of centrality.\n", "  We have applied the Gamow shell model (GSM) in the coupled-channel\nrepresentation to study the astrophysical $S$-factor for the proton radiative\ncapture reaction of $^6$Li. Reaction channels are built by coupling the proton\nwave function expanded in different partial waves with the GSM wave functions\nof the ground state ($1^+$) and the excited states ($3^+_1$, $0^+_1$ and\n$2^+_1$) of $^6$Li. All relevant $E1$, $M1$, and $E2$ transitions from the\ninitial continuum states in $^7$Be to the final bound states (${3/2}^-_1$ and\n${1/2}^-_1$) states are included. It is found that the calculated total\nastrophysical $S$ factor for this reaction agrees well with the experimental\ndata.\n", "  Nematic order resulting from the partial melting of density-waves has been\nproposed as the mechanism to explain nematicity in iron-based superconductors.\nAn outstanding question, however, is whether the microscopic electronic model\nfor these systems -- the multi-orbital Hubbard model -- displays such an\nordered state as its leading instability. In contrast to usual electronic\ninstabilities, such as magnetic and charge order, this fluctuation-driven\nphenomenon cannot be captured by the standard RPA method. Here, by including\nfluctuations beyond RPA in the multi-orbital Hubbard model, we derive its\nnematic susceptibility and contrast it with its ferro-orbital order\nsusceptibility, showing that its leading instability is the spin-driven nematic\nphase. Our results also demonstrate the primary role played by the $d_{xy}$\norbital in driving the nematic transition, and reveal that high-energy magnetic\nfluctuations are essential to stabilize nematic order in the absence of\nmagnetic order.\n", "  We use classical field simulations of the homogeneous Bose gas to study the\nbreakdown of superflow due to vortex nucleation past a cylindrical obstacle at\nfinite temperature. Thermal fluctuations modify the vortex nucleation from the\nobstacle, turning anti-parallel vortex lines (which would be nucleated at zero\ntemperature) into wiggly lines, vortex rings and even vortex tangles. We find\nthat the critical velocity for vortex nucleation decreases with increasing\ntemperature, and scales with the speed of sound of the condensate, becoming\nzero at the critical temperature for condensation.\n", "  Measurements of hadron production in p+C interactions at 31 GeV/c are\nperformed using the NA61/ SHINE spectrometer at the CERN SPS. The analysis is\nbased on the full set of data collected in 2009 using a graphite target with a\nthickness of 4% of a nuclear interaction length. Inelastic and production cross\nsections as well as spectra of $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$, p, $K^0_S$ and $\\Lambda$ are\nmeasured with high precision. These measurements are essential for improved\ncalculations of the initial neutrino fluxes in the T2K long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiment in Japan. A comparison of the NA61/SHINE measurements\nwith predictions of several hadroproduction models is presented.\n", "  In this work, we combine an established method for open quantum systems --\nthe time evolving density matrix using orthogonal polynomials algorithm\n(TEDOPA) -- with the transfer tensors formalism (TTM), a new tool for the\nanalysis, compression and propagation of non-Markovian processes. This enables\nthe investigation of previously inaccessible long-time dynamics, such as those\nensuing from low temperature regimes with arbitrary, possibly highly\nstructured, spectral densities. We briefly introduce both methods, followed by\na benchmark to prove viability and combination synergies. Subsequently we\nillustrate the capabilities of this approach at the hand of specific examples\nand conclude our analysis by highlighting possible further applications of our\nmethod.\n", "  In this work we analyze the Casimir energy and force for a {\\it thick} piston\nconfiguration. This study is performed by utilizing the spectral zeta function\nregularization method. The results we obtain for the Casimir energy and force\ndepend explicitly on the parameters that describe the general self-adjoint\nboundary conditions imposed. Numerical results for the Casimir force are\nprovided for specific types of boundary conditions and are also compared to the\ncorresponding force on an infinitely thin piston.\n", "  Starting from the microscopic description of a normal fluid in terms of any\nkind of local interacting many-particle theory we present a well defined step\nby step procedure to derive the hydrodynamic equations for the macroscopic\nphenomena. We specify the densities of the conserved quantities as the relevant\nhydrodynamic variables and apply the methods of non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics with projection operator techniques. As a result we obtain\ntime-evolution equations for the hydrodynamic variables with three kinds of\nterms on the right-hand sides: reversible, dissipative and fluctuating terms.\nIn their original form these equations are completely exact and contain\nnonlocal terms in space and time which describe nonlocal memory effects.\nApplying a few approximations the nonlocal properties and the memory effects\nare removed. As a result we find the well known hydrodynamic equations of a\nnormal fluid with Gaussian fluctuating forces. In the following we investigate\nif and how the time-inversion invariance is broken and how the second law of\nthermodynamics comes about. Furthermore, we show that the hydrodynamic\nequations with fluctuating forces are equivalent to stochastic Langevin\nequations and the related Fokker-Planck equation. Finally, we investigate the\nfluctuation theorem and find a modification by an additional term.\n", "  We study preheating after hilltop inflation where the inflaton couples to\nanother scalar field, e.g. a right-handed sneutrino, which provides a mechanism\nfor generating the correct initial conditions for inflation and also a decay\nchannel for the inflaton that allows for reheating and non-thermal\nleptogenesis. In the presence of such a coupling, we find that after the phases\nof tachyonic preheating and tachyonic oscillations, during which the inflaton\nfield becomes inhomogeneous, there can be a subsequent preheating phase where\nthe fluctuations of the other field get resonantly enhanced, from initial\nvacuum fluctuations up to amplitudes of the same order (and even larger) as the\nones of the inflaton field. This resonant enhancement differs from the usual\nparametric resonance as the inflaton field is inhomogeneous at the time the\nenhancement takes place. We study this effect using lattice simulations as well\nas semi-analytically with a generalized Floquet analysis for inhomogeneous\nbackground fields.\n", "  In this paper we show that there are explicit Yang-Baxter maps with\nDarboux-Lax representation between Grassmann extensions of algebraic varieties.\nMotivated by some recent results on noncommutative extensions of Darboux\ntransformations, we first derive a Darboux matrix associated with the\nGrassmann-extended derivative Nonlinear Schrodinger (DNLS) equation, and then\nwe deduce novel endomorphisms of Grassmann varieties, which possess the\nYang-Baxter property. In particular, we present ten-dimensional maps which can\nbe restricted to eight-dimensional Yang-Baxter maps on invariant leaves,\nrelated to the Grassmann-extended NLS and DNLS equations. We consider their\nvector generalisations.\n", "  We construct rotating magnetic solutions to the three-dimensional\nEinstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons-dilaton theory with a Liouville potential. These\ninclude a class of black hole solutions which generalize the warped AdS black\nholes. The regular black holes belong to two disjoint sectors. The first sector\nincludes black holes which have a positive mass and are co-rotating, while the\nblack holes of the second sector have a negative mass and are counter-rotating.\nWe also show that a particular, non-black hole, subfamily of our\nthree-dimensional solutions may be uplifted to new regular non-asymptotically\nflat solutions of five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory.\n", "  We present a new Python module - LHCO_reader - for reading detector-level\nevents in LHCO format generated from detector-simulators such as PGS and\nDelphes. Emphasis is placed upon ease of use. The module is installed via pip.\nOnce installed, one can read and scrutinize events, with helpful functions and\nclasses for cutting, plotting and inspecting events, and manipulating\nfour-momenta by e.g. boosting. Implementing complicated analyses should be\nstraight-forward by coding any cuts into Python. Furthermore, common kinematic\nvariables, including $\\alpha_T$ and razor are included out of the box, and\n$m_{T2}$ and $m_{T2}^W$ are provided by interfaces with external libraries.\n", "  We investigate constraints on neutron star structure arising from the\nassumptions that neutron stars have crusts, that recent calculations of pure\nneutron matter limit the equation of state of neutron star matter near the\nnuclear saturation density, that the high-density equation of state is limited\nby causality and the largest high-accuracy neutron star mass measurement, and\nthat general relativity is the correct theory of gravity. We explore the role\nof prior assumptions by considering two classes of equation of state models. In\na first, the intermediate- and high-density behavior of the equation of state\nis parameterized by piecewise polytropes. In the second class, the high-density\nbehavior of the equation of state is parameterized by piecewise continuous line\nsegments. The smallest density at which high-density matter appears is varied\nin order to allow for strong phase transitions above the nuclear saturation\ndensity. We critically examine correlations among the pressure of matter,\nradii, maximum masses, the binding energy, the moment of inertia, and the tidal\ndeformability, paying special attention to the sensitivity of these\ncorrelations to prior assumptions about the equation of state. It is possible\nto constrain the radii of $1.4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ neutron stars to a be larger\nthan 10 km, even without consideration of additional astrophysical\nobservations, for example, those from photospheric radius expansion bursts or\nquiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. We are able to improve the accuracy of known\ncorrelations between the moment of inertia and compactness as well as the\nbinding energy and compactness. We also demonstrate the existence of a\ncorrelation between the neutron star binding energy and the moment of inertia.\n", "  Band gap anomaly is a well-known issue in lead chalcogenides PbX (X=S, Se,\nTe, Po). Combining ab initio calculations and tight-binding (TB) method, we\nhave studied the band evolution in PbX, and found that the band gap anomaly in\nPbTe is mainly related to the high onsite energy of Te 5s orbital and the large\ns-p hopping originated from the irregular extended distribution of Te 5s\nelectrons. Furthermore, our calculations show that PbPo is an indirect band gap\n(6.5 meV) semiconductor with band inversion at L point, which clearly indicates\nthat PbPo is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI). The calculated mirror\nChern number and surface states double confirm this conclusion.\n", "  We propose a new scenario to apply IR-pump-XUV-probe schemes to resolving\nstrong field ionization induced and attosecond pulse driven electron-hole\ndynamics and coherence in real time. The coherent driving of both the infrared\nlaser and the attoscond pulse correlates the dynamics of the core-hole and the\nvalence-hole which leads to the otherwise forbidden absorption and emission of\nXUV photon. An analytical model is developed based on the strong-field\napproximation by taking into account of the essential multielectron\nconfigurations. The emission spectra from the core-valence transition and the\ncore-hole recombination are found modulating strongly as functions of the time\ndelay between the two pulses, which provides a unique insight into the\ninstantaneous ionization and the interplay of the multi-electron-hole\ncoherence.\n", "  The STEREO experiment will search for a sterile neutrino by measuring the\nanti-neutrino energy spectrum as a function of the distance from the source,\nthe ILL nuclear reactor. A dedicated electronic system, hosted in a single\nmicroTCA crate, was designed for this experiment. It performs triggering in two\nstages with various selectable conditions, processing and readout via UDP/IPBUS\nof 68 photomultiplier signals continuously digitized at 250 MSPS. Additionally,\nfor detector performance monitoring, the electronics allow on-line calibration\nby driving LED synchronously with the data acquisition. This paper describes\nthe electronics requirements, architecture and the performances achieved.\n", "  Through the process of inward diffusion, a strongly localized clump of plasma\nis created in a magnetosphere. The creation of the density gradient, instead of\nthe usual flattening by a diffusion process, can be explained by the\ntopological constraints given by the adiabatic invariants of magnetized\nparticles. After developing a canonical formalism for the standard guiding\ncenter dynamics in a dipole magnetic field, we complete our attempt to build a\nstatistical mechanics on a constrained phase space by discussing the\nconstruction principles of the associated diffusion operator. We then\ninvestigate the heating mechanism associated with inward diffusion: as\nparticles move toward regions of higher magnetic field, they experience\npreferential heating of the perpendicular (with respect to the magnetic field)\ntemperature in order to preserve the magnetic moment. A relationship between\nconservation of bounce action and temperature isotropy emerged. We further show\nthat this behavior is scaled by the diffusion parameter of the Fokker-Planck\nequation. These results are confirmed by numerical simulations.\n", "  We report the temperature $T$ and magnetic field $H$ dependence of the\nthermopower $S$ of an itinerant triangular antiferromagnet PdCrO$_2$ in high\nmagnetic fields up to 32 T. In the paramagnetic phase, the zero-field\nthermopower is positive with a value typical of good metals with a high carrier\ndensity. In marked contrast to typical metals, however, $S$ decreases rapidly\nwith increasing magnetic field, approaching zero at the maximum field scale for\n$T >$ 70 K. We argue here that this profound change in the thermoelectric\nresponse derives from the strong interaction of the 4$d$ correlated electrons\nof the Pd ions with the short-range spin correlations of the Cr$^{3+}$ spins\nthat persist beyond the N\\'{e}el ordering temperature due to the combined\neffects of geometrical frustration and low dimensionality.\n", "  We present three parameters exact solutions with possible black holes in $%\n2+1-$dimensional $f\\left( R\\right) =R^{n}$ modified gravity coupled minimally\nto a cloud of strings. These three parameters are $n,$ the cloud of string\ncoupling constant $\\xi $ and an integration constant $C$. Although in general\none has to consider each set of parameters separately; for $n$ an even integer\ngreater than one we give a unified picture providing black holes. For $n\\geq 1$\nwe analyze null / timelike geodesic within the context of particle confinement.\n", "  X-ray echo spectroscopy, a counterpart of neutron spin-echo, is being\nintroduced here to overcome limitations in spectral resolution and weak signals\nof the traditional inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) probes. An image of a\npoint-like x-ray source is defocused by a dispersing system comprised of\nasymmetrically cut specially arranged Bragg diffracting crystals. The defocused\nimage is refocused into a point (echo) in a time-reversal dispersing system. If\nthe defocused beam is inelastically scattered from a sample, the echo signal\nacquires a spatial distribution, which is a map of the inelastic scattering\nspectrum. The spectral resolution of the echo spectroscopy does not rely on the\nmonochromaticity of the x-rays, ensuring strong signals along with a very high\nspectral resolution. Particular schemes of x-ray echo spectrometers for\n0.1--0.02-meV ultra-high-resolution IXS applications (resolving power $> 10^8$)\nwith broadband $\\simeq$~5--13~meV dispersing systems are introduced featuring\nmore than $10^3$ signal enhancement. The technique is general, applicable in\ndifferent photon frequency domains.\n", "  Within the framework of augmented version of superfield formalism, we derive\nthe superspace unitary operator and show its usefulness in the derivation of\nBecchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry transformations for a\nset of interesting models for the Abelian 1-form gauge theories. These models\nare (i) a one (0+1)-dimensional (1D) toy model of a rigid rotor, (ii) the two\n(1+1)-dimensional (2D) modified versions of the Proca and anomalous Abelian\n1-form gauge theories, and (iii) the 2D self-dual bosonic gauge field theory.\nWe provide, in some sense, the alternatives to the horizontality condition (HC)\nand the gauge invariant restrictions (GIRs) in the language of the above\nsuperspace (SUSP) unitary operator. One of the key observations of our present\nendeavor is the result that the SUSP unitary operator and its hermitian\nconjugate are found to be the same for all the Abelian models under\nconsideration (including the 4D interacting Abelian 1-form gauge theories with\nDirac and complex scalar fields which have been discussed earlier). Thus, we\nestablish the universality of the SUSP operator for the above Abelian theories.\n", "  We perform an empirical consistency test of General Relativity/dark energy by\ndisentangling expansion history and growth of structure constraints. We replace\neach late-universe parameter that describes the behavior of dark energy with\ntwo meta-parameters: one describing geometrical information in cosmological\nprobes, and the other controlling the growth of structure. If the underlying\nmodel (a standard wCDM cosmology with General Relativity) is correct, that is\nunder the null hypothesis, the two meta-parameters coincide. If they do not, it\ncould indicate a failure of the model or systematics in the data. We present a\nglobal analysis using state-of-the-art cosmological data sets which points in\nthe direction that cosmic structures prefer a weaker growth than that inferred\nby background probes. This result could signify inconsistencies of the model,\nthe necessity of extensions to it or the presence of systematic errors in the\ndata. We examine all these possibilities. The fact that the result is mostly\ndriven by a specific sub-set of galaxy clusters abundance data, points to the\nneed of a better understanding of this probe.\n", "  The theory of linear stochastic thermodynamics is developed for periodically\ndriven systems in contact with a single reservoir. Appropriate thermodynamic\nforces and fluxes are identified, starting from the entropy production for a\nMarkov process. Onsager coefficients are evaluated, the Onsager-Casimir\nrelations are verified, and explicit expressions are given for an expansion in\nterms of Fourier components. The results are illustrated on a periodically\nmodulated two level system including the optimization of the power output.\n", "  A sizable contribution to heavy quark production in high-energy hadronic and\nnuclear collisions comes from heavy quark-antiquark pair production from gluon\nsplitting during the parton shower evolution. We investigate the effect of\ngluon-medium interaction on open heavy flavor spectra in ultra-relativistic\nheavy-ion collisions. The interaction of hard gluons and heavy quarks with the\nhot QCD medium is simulated by utilizing a Langevin transport model that\nsimultaneously incorporates contributions from collisional and radiative\nprocesses. It is found that while the gluon splitting channel has quite an\nimportant contribution to the single $D$ meson production cross section, its\ninfluence on the final heavy meson nuclear modification turns out to be quite\nmodest because the average lifetime of hard gluons is short before splitting\ninto heavy quark-antiquark pairs during the evolution and propagation of the\nparton shower.\n", "  Competition between ordered phases, and their associated phase transitions,\nare significant in the study of strongly correlated systems. Here we examine\none aspect, the nonequilibrium dynamics of a photoexcited Mott-Peierls system,\nusing an effective Peierls-Hubbard model and exact diagonalization. Near a\ntransition where spin and charge become strongly intertwined, we observe\nanti-phase dynamics and a coupling-strength-dependent suppression or\nenhancement in the static structure factors. The renormalized bosonic\nexcitations coupled to a particular photoexcited electron can be extracted,\nwhich provides an approach for characterizing the underlying bosonic modes. The\nresults from this analysis for different electronic momenta show an uneven\nsoftening due to a stronger coupling near $k_F$. This behavior reflects the\nstrong link between the fermionic momenta, the coupling vertices, and\nultimately the bosonic susceptibilities when multiple phases compete for the\nground state of the system.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides represent an emerging class\nof materials exhibiting various intriguing properties, and integration of such\nmaterials for potential device applications will necessarily encounter creation\nof different boundaries. Using first-principles approaches, here we investigate\nthe structural, electronic, and magnetic properties along two inequivalent\nzigzag M and X edges of MX$_{2}$ (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se). Along the M edges, we\nreveal a previously unrecognized but energetically strongly preferred (2x1)\nreconstruction pattern, which is universally operative for all the MX$_{2}$,\ncharacterized by a self-passivation mechanism through place exchanges of the\noutmost X and M edge atoms. In contrast, the X edges undergo a more moderate\n(2x1) or (3x1) reconstruction for MoX$_{2}$ or WX$_{2}$, respectively. We\nfurther use the prototypical zigzag MoX$_{2}$ nanoribbons to demonstrate that\nthe M and X edges possess distinctly different electronic and magnetic\nproperties, which are discussed for spintronic and catalytic applications.\n", "  The irradiation of few nm thick targets by a finite-contrast high-intensity\nshort-pulse laser results in a strong pre-expansion of these targets at the\narrival time of the main pulse. The targets decompress to near and lower than\ncritical densities plasmas extending over few micrometers, i.e. multiple\nwavelengths. The interaction of the main pulse with such a highly localized but\ninhomogeneous target leads to the generation of a short channel and further\nself-focusing of the laser beam. Experiments at the GHOST laser system at UT\nAustin using such targets measured non-Maxwellian, peaked electron distribution\nwith large bunch charge and high electron density in the laser propagation\ndirection. These results are reproduced in 2D PIC simulations using the EPOCH\ncode, identifying Direct Laser Acceleration (DLA) as the responsible mechanism.\nThis is the first time that DLA has been observed to produce peaked spectra as\nopposed to broad, maxwellian spectra observed in earlier experiments. This\nhigh-density electrons have potential applications as injector beams for a\nfurther wakefield acceleration stage as well as for pump-probe applications.\n", "  The result of a physical measurement depends on the timescale of the\nexperimental probe. In solid-state systems, this simple quantum mechanical\nprinciple has far-reaching consequences: the interplay of several degrees of\nfreedom close to charge, spin or orbital instabilities combined with the\ndisparity of the time scales associated to their fluctuations can lead to\nseemingly contradictory experimental findings. A particularly striking example\nis provided by systems of adatoms adsorbed on semiconductor surfaces where\ndifferent experiments -- angle-resolved photoemission, scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and core-level spectroscopy -- suggest different ordering phenomena.\nUsing most recent first principles many-body techniques, we resolve this puzzle\nby invoking the time scales of fluctuations when approaching the different\ninstabilities. These findings suggest a re-interpretation of ordering phenomena\nand their fluctuations in a wide class of solid-state systems ranging from\norganic materials to high-temperature superconducting cuprates.\n", "  We introduce a novel Entropy-driven Monte Carlo (EdMC) strategy to\nefficiently sample solutions of random Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).\nFirst, we extend a recent result that, using a large-deviation analysis, shows\nthat the geometry of the space of solutions of the Binary Perceptron Learning\nProblem (a prototypical CSP), contains regions of very high-density of\nsolutions. Despite being sub-dominant, these regions can be found by optimizing\na local entropy measure. Building on these results, we construct a fast solver\nthat relies exclusively on a local entropy estimate, and can be applied to\ngeneral CSPs. We describe its performance not only for the Perceptron Learning\nProblem but also for the random $K$-Satisfiabilty Problem (another prototypical\nCSP with a radically different structure), and show numerically that a simple\nzero-temperature Metropolis search in the smooth local entropy landscape can\nreach sub-dominant clusters of optimal solutions in a small number of steps,\nwhile standard Simulated Annealing either requires extremely long cooling\nprocedures or just fails. We also discuss how the EdMC can heuristically be\nmade even more efficient for the cases we studied.\n", "  An exact solution is presented for the time-dependent wavefunction of a\nKramers doublet which propagates around a quantum ring with tuneable Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction. By propagating in segments it is shown that\nKramers-doublet qubits may be defined for which transformations on the Bloch\nsphere may be performed for an integral number of revolutions around the ring.\nThe conditions for full coverage of the Bloch sphere are determined and\nexplained in terms of sequential qubit rotations due to electron motion along\nthe segments, with change of rotation axes between segments due to adiabatic\nchanges in the Rashba spin-orbit interaction. Prospects and challenges for\npossible realizations are discussed for which rings based on InAs quantum wires\nare promising candidates.\n", "  We present a geometrical framework which incorporates higher derivative\ncorrections to the action of N = 2 vector multiplets in terms of an enlarged\nscalar manifold which includes a complex deformation parameter. This enlarged\nspace carries a deformed version of special Kahler geometry which we\ncharacterise. The holomorphic anomaly equation arises in this framework from\nthe integrability condition for the existence of a Hesse potential.\n", "  The continuum-fitting and the iron line methods are leading techniques\ncapable of probing the spacetime geometry around astrophysical black hole\ncandidates and testing the no-hair theorem. In the present paper, we review the\ntwo approaches, from the astrophysical models and their assumptions, to the\nconstraining power with present and future facilities.\n", "  Current quantisations of fermions in cylindrical coordinates are shown to be\ninadequate in calculating some single-particle expectation values. This paper\ndevelops an alternate quantisation, applicable to one-particle states, which is\ngeneralised to rotating frames in cylindrical coordinates. Using this\nquantization, an explicit calculation of the velocity of a flat space free\nfermion as observed by a rotating observer is presented. This calculation\ndemonstrates the validity of this quantisation and the cancellation of\nnon-inertial rotational effects in the velocity, naively expected from the\nmixing of particle and anti-particle field operators.\n", "  We discuss a scenario where the DAMA modulation effect is explained by a\nWeakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) which upscatters inelastically to a\nheavier state and predominantly couples to the spin of protons. In this\nscenario constraints from xenon and germanium targets are evaded dynamically,\ndue to the suppression of the WIMP coupling to neutrons, while those from\nfluorine targets are evaded kinematically, because the minimal WIMP incoming\nspeed required to trigger upscatters off fluorine exceeds the maximal WIMP\nvelocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. In this scenario WIMP\nscatterings off sodium are usually sensitive to the large-speed tail of the\nWIMP velocity distribution and modulated fractions of the signal close to unity\narise in a natural way. On the other hand, a halo-independent analysis with\nmore conservative assumptions about the WIMP velocity distribution allows to\nextend the viable parameter space to configurations where large modulated\nfractions are not strictly necessary. We discuss large modulated fractions in\nthe Maxwellian case showing that they imply a departure from the usual cosine\ntime dependence of the expected signal in DAMA. However we explicitly show that\nthe DAMA data is not sensitive to this distortion, both in time and frequency\nspace, even in the extreme case of a 100 % modulated fraction. Moreover the\nsame scenario provides an explanation of the maximum in the energy spectrum of\nthe modulation amplitude detected by DAMA in terms of WIMPs whose minimal\nincoming speed matches the kinematic threshold for inelastic upscatters. For\nthe elastic case the detection of such maximum suggests an inversion of the\nmodulation phase below the present DAMA energy threshold, while this is not\nexpected for inelastic scattering. This may allow to discriminate between the\ntwo scenarios in a future low-threshold analysis of the DAMA data.\n", "  Nucleon-antinucleon optical potential, which explains the experimental data\nfor the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow p\\bar{p}$ and\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow\\mbox{pions}$ near the threshold of $p\\bar{p}$ pair\nproduction, is suggested. To obtain this potential we have used the available\nexperimental data for $p\\bar{p}$ scattering, $p\\bar{p}$ pair production in\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation, and the ratio of electromagnetic form factors of a\nproton in the timelike region. It turns out that final-state interaction via\nthe optical potential allows one to reproduce the available experimental data\nwith good accuracy. Our results for the cross sections of $e^{+}e^{-}\\to6\\pi$\nprocess near the threshold of $p\\bar{p}$ pair production are in agreement with\nthe recent experiments.\n", "  An efficient and stable algorithm for U(1) symmetric matrix product states\n(MPS) with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is proposed. It is applied to a\nstudy of correlation and entanglement properties of the eigenstates of the\nspin-1/2 XXZ model with different spin projections. Convergence properties and\naccuracy of the algorithm are studied in detail.\n", "  The well-known Robertson-Schr\\\"odinger uncertainty relations have\nstate-dependent lower bounds which are trivial for certain states. We present a\ngeneral approach to deriving tight state-independent uncertainty relations for\nqubit measurements that completely characterise the obtainable uncertainty\nvalues. This approach can give such relations for any number of observables,\nand we do so explicitly for arbitrary pairs and triples of qubit measurements.\nWe show how these relations can be transformed into equivalent tight entropic\nuncertainty relations. More generally, they can be expressed in terms of any\nmeasure of uncertainty that can be written as a function of the expectation\nvalue of the observable for a given state.\n", "  We briefly discuss recent experiments on the BCS-BEC crossover with ultracold\nalkali-metal atoms both in three-dimensional configurations and two-dimensional\nones. Then we analyze the quantum-field-theory formalism used to describe an\nattractive $D$-dimensional Fermi gas taking into account Gaussian fluctuations.\nFinally, we apply this formalism to obtain a reliable equation of state of the\n2D system at low temperaratures in the BEC regime of the crossover by\nperforming a meaningful dimensional regularization of the divergent zero-point\nenergy of collective bosonic excitations.\n", "  We demonstrate that blending fluorinated molecules in PEDOT:PSS hole\ntransport layers (HTL) induces charge transfers which impact on both charge\nextraction and photogeneration within organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. OPVs\nfabricated with modified HTL and two photoactive polymer blends led\nsystematically to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) increases, with\nPTB7:PC70BM blend exhibiting PCE of ~ 8.3 %, i.e. ~ 15 % increase compared to\npristine HTL devices. A reduced device-to-device characteristics variations was\nalso noticed when fluorinated additives were used to modify the PEDOT:PSS.\nShading lights onto the effect of HTL fluorination, we show that the morphology\nof the polymer:PCBM blends remains surprisingly unaffected by the fluorinated\nHTL surface energy but that, instead, the OPVs are impacted not only by the HTL\nelectronic properties (work function, dipole layer, open circuit voltage,\ncharge transfer dynamic) but also by alteration of the complex refractive\nindices (photogeneration, short circuit current density, external quantum\nefficiencies, electro-optic modelling). Both mechanisms find their origin in\nfluorination induced charge transfers. This work points towards fluorination as\na promising strategy toward combining both external quantum efficiency\nmodulation and power conversion efficiency enhancement in OPVs. Charge\ntransfers could also be used more broadly to tune the optical constants and\nelectric field distribution, as well as to reduce interfacial charge\nrecombinations within OPVs.\n", "  Superconductors have often been described as `giant atoms'. The simplest\ndescription of atoms that heralded their quantum understanding was proposed by\nBohr in 1913. The Bohr atom starts from some simple assumptions and deduces\nthat the angular momentum of the electron in Bohr orbits is quantized in\ninteger units of $\\hbar$. This remarkable result, which does not appear to be\nimplicit in the assumptions of the model, can be interpreted as a `theoretical\nproof' of the model's validity to describe physical reality at some level.\nSimilarly we point out here that from some simple assumptions it can be deduced\nthat electrons in superconductors reside in mesoscopic orbits with orbital\nangular momentum $\\hbar/2$. This implies that both in superconductors and in\nferromagnets the long-range order results from elementary units of identical\nangular momentum. Similarly to the case of the Bohr atom we propose that this\nremarkable result is compelling evidence that this physics, which is not part\nof conventional BCS theory, describes physical reality at some level and\nheralds a qualitatively new understanding of superconductors.\n", "  We consider the possibility of inflationary magnetogenesis due to dynamical\ncouplings of the electromagnetic fields to gravity. We find that large\nprimordial magnetic fields can be generated during inflation without the strong\ncoupling problem, backreaction problem, or curvature perturbation problem,\nwhich seed large-scale magnetic fields with observationally interesting\nstrengths.\n", "  We present a theory of the electron structure and the Zeeman effect for the\nhelical edge states emerging in two-dimensional topological insulators based on\nHgTe/HgCdTe quantum wells with strong natural interface inversion asymmetry.\nThe interface inversion asymmetry, reflecting the real atomistic structure of\nthe quantum well, drastically modifies both bulk and edge states. For the\nin-plane magnetic field, this asymmetry leads to a strong anisotropy of the\nedge-state effective $g$-factor which becomes dependent on the edge\norientation. The interface inversion asymmetry also couples the counter\npropagating edge states in the out-of-plane magnetic field leading to the\nopening of the gap in the edge-state spectrum by arbitrary small fields.\n", "  We present a study of the night sky brightness around the extended\nmetropolitan area of Madrid using Sky Quality Meter (SQM) photometers. The map\nis the first to cover the spatial distribution of the sky brightness in the\ncenter of the Iberian peninsula. These surveys are neccessary to test the light\npollution models that predict night sky brightness as a function of the\nlocation and brightness of the sources of light pollution and the scattering of\nlight in the atmosphere. We describe the data-retrieval methodology, which\nincludes an automated procedure to measure from a moving vehicle in order to\nspeed up the data collection, providing a denser and wider survey than previous\nworks with similar time frames. We compare the night sky brightness map to the\nnocturnal radiance measured from space by the DMSP satellite. We find that i) a\nsingle source model is not enough to explain the radial evolution of the night\nsky brightness, despite the predominance of Madrid in size and population, and\nii) that the orography of the region should be taken into account when deriving\ngeo-specific models from general first-principles models. We show the tight\nrelationship between these two luminance measures. This finding sets up an\nalternative roadmap to extended studies over the globe that will not require\nthe local deployment of photometers or trained personnel.\n", "  We state some mathematical predictions concerning the kernels of Dirac-type\noperators on moduli spaces of (singular) monopoles in R^3. These predictions\nfollow from the semiclassical interpretation of physical results on spaces of\n(framed) BPS states in d=4, N=2 gauge theories.\n", "  We develop a high-precision model for relativistic observables of the Atomic\nClock Ensemble in Space (ACES) experiment on the International Space Station\n(ISS). We develop all relativistic coordinate transformations that are needed\nto describe the motion of ACES in Earth orbit and to compute observable\nquantities. We analyze the accuracy of the required model as it applies to the\nproper-to-coordinate time transformations, light time equation, and spacecraft\nequations of motion. We consider various sources of nongravitational noise and\ntheir effects on ACES. We estimate the accuracy of orbit reconstruction that is\nneeded to satisfy the ACES science objectives. Based on our analysis, we derive\nmodels for the relativistic observables of ACES, which also account for the\ncontribution of atmospheric drag on the clock rate. We include the Earth's\noblateness coefficient $J_2$ and the effects of major nongravitational forces\non the orbit of the ISS. We demonstrate that the ACES reference frame is\npseudo-inertial at the level of accuracy required by the experiment. We\nconstruct a Doppler-canceled science observable representing the gravitational\nredshift. We derive accuracy requirements for ISS navigation. The improved\nmodel is accurate up to $<1$ ps and $\\sim 4\\times 10^{-17}$ for time and\nfrequency transfers, correspondingly. These limits are determined by the higher\norder harmonics in Earth's gravitational potential.\n", "  Depletion-induced interactions between colloids in colloid-polymer mixtures\ndepend in range and strength on size, shape, and concentration of depletants.\nCrowding by colloids in turn affects shapes of polymer coils, such as\nbiopolymers in biological cells. By simulating hard-sphere colloids and\nrandom-walk polymers, modeled as fluctuating ellipsoids, we compute\ndepletion-induced potentials and polymer shape distributions. Comparing results\nwith exact density-functional theory calculations, molecular simulations, and\nexperiments, we show that polymer shape fluctuations play an important role in\ndepletion and crowding phenomena.\n", "  Depletion forces and macromolecular crowding govern the structure and\nfunction of biopolymers in biological cells and the properties of polymer\nnanocomposite materials. To isolate and analyze the influence of polymer shape\nfluctuations and penetrability on depletion-induced interactions and crowding\nby nanoparticles, we model polymers as effective penetrable ellipsoids, whose\nshapes fluctuate according to the probability distributions of the eigenvalues\nof the gyration tensor of an ideal random walk. Within this model, we apply\nMonte Carlo simulation methods to compute the depletion-induced potential of\nmean force between hard nanospheres and crowding-induced shape distributions of\npolymers in the protein limit, in which polymer coils can be easily penetrated\nby smaller nanospheres. By comparing depletion potentials from simulations of\nellipsoidal and spherical polymer models with predictions of polymer field\ntheory and free-volume theory, we show that polymer depletion-induced\ninteractions and crowding depend sensitively on polymer shapes and\npenetrability, with important implications for bulk thermodynamic phase\nbehavior.\n", "  We investigate the steerability of two-qubit Bell-diagonal states under\nprojective measurements by the steering party. In the simplest nontrivial\nscenario of two projective measurements, we solve this problem completely by\nvirtue of the connection between the steering problem and the joint-measurement\nproblem. A necessary and sufficient criterion is derived together with a simple\ngeometrical interpretation. Our study shows that a Bell-diagonal state is\nsteerable by two projective measurements iff it violates the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, in sharp contrast with the strict\nhierarchy expected between steering and Bell nonlocality. We also introduce a\nsteering measure and clarify its connections with concurrence and the volume of\nthe steering ellipsoid. In particular, we determine the maximal concurrence and\nellipsoid volume of Bell-diagonal states that are not steerable by two\nprojective measurements. Finally, we explore the steerability of Bell-diagonal\nstates under three projective measurements. A simple sufficient criterion is\nderived, which can detect the steerability of many states that are not\nsteerable by two projective measurements. Our study offers valuable insight on\nsteering of Bell-diagonal states as well as the connections between\nentanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality.\n", "  In this paper, we use the displacement operator together with parity\noperation to construct the superposition of two coherent states. By\ntransmitting this superposition from 50-50 beam splitter the two-mode qubit\nlike ECS is generated. Moreover, we introduce a controllable method for\nproducing qutrit like ECS using atom-field interaction in cavity QED and beam\nsplitter. We will show that the distances of peaks of Wigner functions for\nreduced density matrices of two-mode ECS's are entanglement sensitive and can\nbe a witness for entanglement. To confirm the results we use concurrence\nmeasure to compare bipartite entanglement of ECS's with the behavior of peaks\nof Wigner functions. Moreover, we investigate decoherence effects on Wigner\nfunction, arising from transmitting ECS's through noisy channels.\n", "  We develop a procedure to determine the portion of exact Hartree-Fock\nexchange interaction contained in a hybrid density functional to treat the\nrange of electronic correlation governing the physics of a system as a function\nof a thermodynamical parameter. This includes systems that depend on physical\nparameters accessible to experiment (i.e., temperature, pressure, composition,\netc.) or those composed of two or more materials such as heterostructures and\ninterfaces. This approach is applied to LaMnO$_3$ where for the first time we\nare able to simulate the high temperature insulator-to-metal transition (IMT)\nand observe a half-metallic orbital disorder ferromagnetic state using density\nfunctional theory. In particular, we show that the softening of the\n\\textit{Q$_2$} Jahn-Teller mode plays a central role in driving the IMT. These\nfindings are likely to motivate the investigation of heterostructures and bulk\nmaterials that contain a range of electronic correlation in similar material\nsystems.\n", "  We investigate the effects of magnetic and nonmagnetic impurities on the\ntwo-dimensional surface states of three-dimensional topological insulators\n(TIs). Modeling weak and strong TIs using a generic four-band Hamiltonian,\nwhich allows for a breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries and takes\ninto account random local potentials as well as the Zeeman and orbital effects\nof external magnetic fields, we compute the local density of states, the\nsingle-particle spectral function, and the conductance for a (contacted) slab\ngeometry by numerically exact techniques based on kernel polynomial expansion\nand Green's function approaches. We show that bulk disorder refills the\nsuface-state Dirac gap induced by a homogeneous magnetic field with states,\nwhereas orbital (Peierls-phase) disorder perserves the gap feature. The former\neffect is more pronounced in weak TIs than in strong TIs. At moderate\nrandomness, disorder-induced conducting channels appear in the surface layer,\npromoting diffusive metallicity. Random Zeeman fields rapidly destroy any\nconducting surface states. Imprinting quantum dots on a TI's surface, we\ndemonstrate that carrier transport can be easily tuned by varying the gate\nvoltage, even to the point where quasi-bound dot states may appear.\n", "  The combination of Rashba spin-orbit coupling and potential disorder induces\na random current operator for the edge states of a 2D topological insulator. We\nprove that charge transport through such an edge is ballistic at any\ntemperature, with or without Luttinger liquid interactions. The solution\nexploits a mapping to a spin 1/2 in a time-dependent field that preserves the\nprojection along one randomly undulating component (integrable dynamics). Our\nresult is exact and rules out random Rashba backscattering as a source of\ntemperature-dependent transport, absent integrability-breaking terms.\n", "  We have carried out micromagnetic simulations of the gyrotropic resonance\nmode of a magnetic vortex in the presence of spatially localized and spatially\nuniform out-of-plane magnetic fields. We show that the field-induced change in\nthe gyrotropic mode frequency is significantly larger when the field is\ncentrally localized over lengths which are comparable to or a few times larger\nthan the vortex core radius. When aligned with the core magnetization, such\nfields generate an additional confinement of the core. This confinement\nincreases the vortex stiffness in the small displacement limit, leading to a\nresonance shift which is greater than that expected for a uniform out-of-plane\nfield of the same amplitude. Fields generated by uniformly magnetized spherical\nparticles having a fixed separation from the disk are found to generate\nanalogous effects except that there is a maximum in the shift at intermediate\nparticle sizes where field localization and stray field magnitude combine\noptimally to generate a maximum confinement.\n", "  A new mechanism for the acceleration of ultra high energy cosmic rays\n(UHECRs) is presented here. It is based on the tunnel-ionization of neutral\natoms approaching electrically charged stellar black holes and on the repulsion\nof the resulting positively charged atomic part by huge, long range electric\nfields. Energies above $10^{18}$ eV for these particles are calculated in a\nsimple way by means of this one-by-one, all-electrical model. When this\nacceleration mechanism is combined with the supernova (SN) explosion in the\ngalactic halo of the massive runaway stars expelled from the galactic disk,\nthen the various results obtained are shown to be compatible with virtually all\nthe main observational facts about these UHECRs. Among these facts, this model\npredicts nearly the correct values of the measured top energy of the UHECRs and\ntheir flux in a specified EeV energy range. It also explains the near isotropy\nof arrivals of these energetic particles to Earth, as it has recently been\nmeasured by the Auger Observatory.\n", "  We derive from first principles the momentum exchange between a photon and a\nquantum mirror upon reflection, by considering the boundary conditions imposed\nby the mirror surface on the photon wave equation. We show that the system\ngenerally ends up in an entangled state, unless the mirror position uncertainty\nis much smaller than the photon wavelength, when the mirror behaves\nclassically. Our treatment leads us directly to the conclusion that the photon\nmomentum has the known value hk/2{\\pi}. This implies that when the mirror is\nimmersed in a dielectric medium the photon radiation pressure is proportional\nto the medium refractive index n. Our work thus contributes to the longstanding\nAbraham-Minkowski debate about the momentum of light in a medium. We interpret\nthe result by associating the Minkowski momentum (which is proportional to n)\nwith the canonical momentum of light, which appears naturally in quantum\nformulations.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of generating a light composite scalar boson, in a\nscenario that we may generically call Technicolor, or in any variation of a\nstrongly interacting theory, where by light we mean a scalar composite mass\nabout one order of magnitude below the characteristic scale of the strong\ntheory. Instead of most of the studies about a composite Higgs boson, which are\nbased on effective Lagrangians, we consider this problem in the framework of\nnon-perturbative solutions of the fermionic Schwinger-Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter\nequations. We study a range of mechanisms proposed during the recent years to\nform such light composite boson, and verify that such possibility seems to be\nnecessarily associated to a fermionic self-energy that decreases slowly with\nthe momentum.\n", "  We report the detection of CO(J=3-2) line emission in the strongly-lensed\nsubmillimeter galaxy (SMG) SMM J0939+8315 at z=2.221, using the Combined Array\nfor Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy. SMM J0939+8315 hosts a type-2\nquasar, and is gravitationally lensed by the radio galaxy 3C220.3 and its\ncompanion galaxy at z=0.685. The 104 GHz continuum emission underlying the CO\nline is detected toward 3C220.3 with an integrated flux density of S_cont = 7.4\n+/- 1.4 mJy. Using the CO(J=3-2) line intensity of I_(CO(3-2)) = (12.6 +/- 2.0)\nJy km s^-1, we derive a lensing- and excitation-corrected CO line luminosity of\nL'(CO(3-2)) = (3.4 +/- 0.7) x 10^10 (10.1/mu_L) K km s^-1 pc^2 for the SMG,\nwhere mu_L is the lensing magnification factor inferred from our lens modeling.\nThis translates to a molecular gas mass of M_gas = (2.7 +/- 0.6) x 10^10\n(10.1/mu_L) Msun. Fitting spectral energy distribution models to the\n(sub)-millimeter data of this SMG yields a dust temperature of T =\n63.1^{+1.1}_{-1.3} K, a dust mass of M_dust = (5.2 +/- 2.1) x 10^8 (10.1/mu_L)\nMsun, and a total infrared luminosity of L_IR = (9.1 +/- 1.2) x 10^12\n(10.1/mu_L) Lsun. We find that the properties of the interstellar medium of SMM\nJ0939+8315 overlap with both SMGs and type-2 quasars. Hence, SMM J0939+8315 may\nbe transitioning from a star-bursting phase to an unobscured quasar phase as\ndescribed by the \"evolutionary link\" model, according to which this system may\nrepresent an intermediate stage in the evolution of present-day galaxies at an\nearlier epoch.\n", "  We investigate opinion formation in a kinetic exchange opinion model, where\nopinions are represented by numbers in the real interval $[-1,1]$ and agents\nare typified by the individual degree of conviction about the opinion that they\nsupport. Opinions evolve through pairwise interactions governed by competitive\npositive and negative couplings, that promote imitation and dissent,\nrespectively. The model contemplates also another type of nonconformity such\nthat agents can occasionally choose their opinions independently of the\ninteractions with other agents. The steady states of the model as a function of\nthe parameters that describe conviction, dissent and independence are analyzed,\nwith particular emphasis on the emergence of extreme opinions. Then, we\ncharacterize the possible ordered and disordered phases and the occurrence or\nsuppression of phase transitions that arise spontaneously due to the disorder\nintroduced by the heterogeneity of the agents and/or their interactions.\n", "  Laser wakefield acceleration permits the generation of ultra-short,\nhigh-brightness relativistic electron beams on a millimeter scale. While those\nfeatures are of interest for many applications, the source remains constraint\nby the poor stability of the electron injection process. Here we present\nresults on injection and acceleration of electrons in pure nitrogen and argon.\nWe observe stable, continuous ionization-induced injection of electrons into\nthe wakefield for laser powers exceeding a threshold of 7 TW. The beam charge\nscales approximately linear with the laser energy and is limited by beam\nloading. For 40 TW laser pulses we measure a maximum charge of almost 1 nC per\nshot, originating mostly from electrons of less than 10 MeV energy. The\nrelatively low energy, the high charge and its stability make this source\nwell-suited for applications such as non-destructive testing. Hence, we\ndemonstrate the production of energetic radiation via bremsstrahlung conversion\nat 1 Hz repetition rate. In accordance with Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulations, we\nmeasure a gamma-ray source size of less than 100 microns for a 0.5 mm tantalum\nconverter placed at 2 mm from the accelerator exit. Furthermore we present\nradiographs of image quality indicators.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) known\nto have small masses of the central black hole and high accretion rates. NLS1s\nare generally radio-quiet, but a small part of them (about 7\\%) are radio-loud.\nThe recent discovery of powerful relativistic jets in radio-loud NLS1s\n(RLNLS1s), emitting at high-energy $\\gamma$-rays, opened intriguing questions.\nThe observed luminosity of the jet is generally weak, smaller than blazars,\nalthough when rescaled for the mass of the central black hole, it becomes of\nthe same order of magnitude of the latter. The weak luminosity, and hence\nobserved flux, resulted in a small number of known RLNLS1. From a recent survey\nof RLNLS1s, it was found that only 8 out of 42 sources had radio flux density\nat 1.4 GHz greater than 100 mJy, while 21 out of 42 had flux density smaller\nthan 10 mJy. In addition, given the strong variability at all wavelengths, with\npresent-day facilities RLNLS1s can often only be detected during high activity\nperiods. The Square Kilometer Array (SKA), with its superior sensitivity, will\nbreak this limit, allowing us to unveil a relatively unknown population of\njetted AGN. We present the results of a study aimed at evaluating the scenario\nthat could emerge after the advent of SKA.\n", "  We present our results on the Chandra X-ray Observatory Advanced CCD Imaging\nSpectrometer (ACIS) observations of the bright Oort Cloud comets C/2012 S1\n(ISON) and C/2011 L4 (PanSTARRS). ISON was observed between 2013 October\n31-November 06 during variable speed solar wind (SW), and PanSTARRS was\nobserved between 2013 April 17-23 during fast SW. ISON produced an extended\nparabolic X-ray morphology consistent with a collisionally thick coma, while\nPanSTARRS demonstrated only a diffuse X-ray-emitting region. We consider these\nemissions to be from charge exchange (CX) and model each comet's emission\nspectrum from first principles accordingly. Our model agrees with the\nobservational spectra and also generates composition ratios for heavy, highly\ncharged SW ions interacting with the cometary atmosphere. We compare our\nderived SW ion compositions to observational data and find a strong agreement\nbetween them. These results further demonstrate the utility of CX emissions as\na remote diagnostics tool of both astrophysical plasma interaction and SW\ncomposition. In addition, we observe potential soft X-ray emissions via ACIS\naround 0.2 keV from both comets that are correlated in intensity to the hard\nX-ray emissions between 0.4-1.0 keV. We fit our CX model to these emissions,\nbut our lack of a unique solution at low energies makes it impossible to\nconclude if they are cometary CX in origin. We lastly discuss probable emission\nmechanism sources for the soft X-rays and explore new opportunities these\nfindings present in understanding cometary emission processes via Chandra.\n", "  This study considers the spreading of a Newtonian and perfectly wetting\nliquid in a square array of cylindric micropillars confined between two plates.\nWe show experimentally that the dynamics of the contact line follows a\nWashburn-like law which depends on the characteristics of the micropillar array\n(height, diameter and pitch). The presence of pillars can either enhanced or\nslow down the motion of the contact line. A theoretical model based on\ncapillary and viscous forces has been developed in order to rationalize our\nobservations. Finally, the impact of pillars on the volumic flow rate of liquid\nwhich is pumped in the microchannel is inspected.\n", "  We study the magnetotransport properties of high mobility holes in monolayer\nand bilayer WSe$_2$, which display well defined Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)\noscillations, and quantum Hall states (QHSs) in high magnetic fields. In both\nmono and bilayer WSe$_2$, the SdH oscillations and the QHSs occur predominantly\nat even filling factors, evincing a two-fold Landau level degeneracy. The\nFourier transform analysis of the SdH oscillations in bilayer WSe$_2$ reveal\nthe presence of two subbands localized in the top or the bottom layer, as well\nas negative compressibility. From the temperature dependence of the SdH\noscillations we determine a hole effective mass of $0.45m_{0}$ for both mono\nand bilayer WSe$_2$.\n", "  The kinematic constrains on interacting nucleons in Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) heavy-ion collisions are investigated in the framework of the Heavy Ion\nJet Interaction Generator (HIJING) code incorporated with a collective cascade\nrecipe. The latter is used to implement energy-momentum conservation constrains\non both primary and secondary interacting nucleons. It is found that the\nenergy-momentum conservation constrains on the interacting nucleons affect the\nwhole charged particle pseudo-rapidity density distribution\n$(\\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\\eta})$, at different centralities (from central (0-5\\%) to\nperipheral (70-80\\%) collisions), in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} =2.76$\nTeV. In particular, the kinematic constrains on interacting nucleons are shown\nto reduce $(\\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\\eta})$ yield at mid-pseudorapidity\n$(\\lvert\\eta\\rvert<2)$ in all centrality intervals, which is consistent with\nthe LHC data. In addition, the model predicts an enhancement of the hadron\nproduction at $\\lvert\\eta\\rvert>8$, which could be checked in future ALICE Zero\nDegree calorimeter. Such an enhancement is found to be mainly due to the\ninteractions of protons at the spectator parts of the collision. This indicates\nthat the kinematic constrains are important for a correct geometrical treatment\nof Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies.\n", "  In this paper we define and study a new class of states (the empty states).\nThese states are the superposition of two identical states (self-superposition\nstate). We defined three different representations of theses states, namely,\nthe source, the operator, and the self-superposition representations. Then, we\napply the empty state to an elementary example state and find its three\ndifferent representations. We apply the empty state to Fock states and find an\nundetermined state. Then, we apply the empty state to the coherent state to\nproduce the empty state of the coherent state (the EC state), and determine\nsome of its mathematical, statistical and nonclassical properties.\n", "  In this manuscript we study the modeling of experimental data and its impact\non the resulting integral experimental covariance and correlation matrices. By\ninvestigating a set of three low enriched and water moderated UO2 fuel rod\narrays we found that modeling the same set of data with different, yet\nreasonable assumptions concerning the fuel rod composition and its geometric\nproperties leads to significantly different covariance matrices or correlation\ncoefficients. Following a Monte Carlo sampling approach, we show for nine\ndifferent modeling assumptions the corresponding correlation coefficients and\nsensitivity profiles for each pair of the effective neutron multiplication\nfactor keff. Within the 95% confidence interval the correlation coefficients\nvary from 0 to 1, depending on the modeling assumptions. Our findings show that\nthe choice of modeling can have a huge impact on integral experimental\ncovariance matrices. When the latter are used in a validation procedure to\nderive a bias, this procedure can be affected by the choice of modeling\nassumptions, too. The correct consideration of correlated data seems to be\ninevitable if the experimental data in a validation procedure is limited or one\ncannot rely on a sufficient number of uncorrelated data sets, e.g. from\ndifferent laboratories using different setups etc.\n", "  We theoretically investigate spin dynamics in spin-orbit-coupled materials.\nIn the ballistic limit, the spin lifetime is dictated by dephasing that arises\nfrom energy broadening plus a non-uniform spin precession. For the case of\nclean graphene, we find a strong anisotropy with spin lifetimes that can be\nshort even for modest energy scales, on the order of a few ns. These results\noffer deeper insight into the nature of spin dynamics in graphene, and are also\napplicable to the investigation of other systems where spin-orbit coupling\nplays an important role.\n", "  High-redshift quasars are important tracers of structure and evolution in the\nearly universe. However, they are very rare and difficult to find when using\ncolor selection because of contamination from late-type dwarfs. High-redshift\nquasar surveys based on only optical colors suffer from incompleteness and low\nidentification efficiency, especially at $z\\gtrsim4.5$. We have developed a new\nmethod to select $4.7\\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.4$ quasars with both high efficiency\nand completeness by combining optical and mid-IR Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE) photometric data, and are conducting a luminous $z\\sim5$ quasar\nsurvey in the whole Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint. We have\nspectroscopically observed 99 out of 110 candidates with $z$-band magnitudes\nbrighter than 19.5 and 64 (64.6\\%) of them are quasars with redshifts of\n$4.4\\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.5$ and absolute magnitudes of $-29\\lesssim M_{1450}\n\\lesssim -26.4$. In addition, we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected\nwith the same criteria and identified 8 (57.1\\%) of them as quasars with\n$4.7<z<5.4$ . Among 72 newly identified quasars, 12 of them are at $5.2 < z <\n5.7$, which leads to an increase of $\\sim$36\\% of the number of known quasars\nat this redshift range. More importantly, our identifications doubled the\nnumber of quasars with $M_{1450}<-27.5$ at $z>4.5$, which will set strong\nconstraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function. We also expand\nour method to select quasars at $z\\gtrsim5.7$. In this paper we report the\ndiscovery of four new luminous $z\\gtrsim5.7$ quasars based on SDSS-WISE\nselection.\n", "  In iron-based superconductors, a unique tri-layer Fe-As (Se, Te, P) plays an\nessential role in controlling the electronic properties, especially the Cooper\npairing interaction. Here we use scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\n(STM/S) to investigate the role of arsenic atom in superconducting\nBa0.4K0.6Fe2As2 by directly breaking and restoring the Fe-As structure at\natomic scale. After the up-As-layer peeled away, the tunneling spectrum of the\nexposed iron surface reveals a shallow incoherent gap, indicating a severe\nsuppression of superconductivity without arsenic covering. When a pair of\narsenic atoms is placed on such iron surface, a localized topographic feature\nis formed due to Fe-As orbital hybridization, and the superconducting coherent\npeaks recover locally with the gap magnitude the same as that on the iron-layer\nfully covered by arsenic. These observations unravel the Fe-As interactions on\nan atomic scale and imply its essential roles in the iron-based\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  The Cooper pairing and phase coherence are two fundamental aspects of\nsuperconductivity. Due to breaking time reversal symmetry, magnetic impurities\nare detrimental to superconductivity, yet microscopically how they affect the\npairing strength and phase coherence in a real material is less understood.\nRecently we observed a robust zero-energy bound state at an interstitial Fe\nimpurity (IFI) in superconducting Fe1+x(Te,Se), signifying intense impurity\nscattering. Here we report a comprehensive study, using scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) technique, of the global effects of IFIs on the\nground state of Fe1+x(Te,Se) over a wide range of IFI concentration x. Our high\nresolution tunnelling spectroscopy and quasi-particle interference data at very\nlow temperature demonstrate that IFIs hardly affect the electron pairing\nstrength, while they cause significant decoherence of Cooper pairs in\nprecedence of the Coulomb correlation, eventually driving the ground state of\nthe system from strong-coupling-superconductor to diffusive-metal with\nincoherent electron pairs.\n", "  We used the Revised Flat Galaxy Catalog (RFGC) to create a sample of\nultra-flat galaxies (UFG) covering the whole northern and southern sky apart\nfrom the Milky Way zone. It contains 817 spiral galaxies seen edge-on, selected\ninto the UFG sample according to their apparent axial ratios $(a/b)_B\\geq10.0$\nand $(a/b)_R\\geq8.53$ in the blue and red bands, respectively. Within this\nbasic sample we fixed an exemplary sample of 441 UFG galaxies having the radial\nvelocities of $V_{LG} < 10000$ km s$^{-1}$, Galactic latitude of $\\mid\nb\\mid>10^{\\circ}$ and the blue angular diameter of $a_B > 1.0^{\\prime}$.\nAccording to the Schmidt test the exemplary sample of 441 galaxies is\ncharacterized by about (80-90)% completeness, what is quite enough to study\ndifferent properties of the ultra-flat galaxies. We found that more than 3/4 of\nUFGs have the morphological types within the narrow range of $T= 7\\pm1$, i.e.\nthe thinnest stellar disks occur among the Scd, Sd, and Sdm types. The average\nsurface brightness of UFG galaxies tends to diminish towards the flattest\nbulge-less galaxies. Regularly shaped disks without signs of asymmetry make up\nabout 2/3 both among all the RFGC galaxies, and the UFG sample objects. About\n60% of ultra-flat galaxies can be referred to dynamically isolated objects,\nwhile 30% of them probably belong to the scattered associations (filaments,\nwalls), and only about 10% of them are dynamically dominating galaxies with\nrespect to their neighbours.\n", "  In the study of complex physical and physiological systems represented by\nmultivariate time series, an issue of great interest is the description of the\nsystem dynamics over a range of different temporal scales. While\ninformation-theoretic approaches to the multiscale analysis of complex dynamics\nare being increasingly used, the theoretical properties of the applied measures\nare poorly understood. This study introduces for the first time a framework for\nthe analytical computation of information dynamics for linear multivariate\nstochastic processes explored at different time scales. After showing that the\nmultiscale processing of a vector autoregressive (VAR) process introduces a\nmoving average (MA) component, we describe how to represent the resulting VARMA\nprocess using state-space (SS) models and how to exploit the SS model\nparameters to compute analytical measures of information storage and\ninformation transfer for the original and rescaled processes. The framework is\nthen used to quantify multiscale information dynamics for simulated\nunidirectionally and bidirectionally coupled VAR processes, showing that\nrescaling may lead to insightful patterns of information storage and transfer\nbut also to potentially misleading behaviors.\n", "  Advancements in our understanding of exoplanetary atmospheres, from massive\ngas giants down to rocky worlds, depend on the constructive challenges between\nobservations and models. We are now on a clear trajectory for improvements in\nexoplanet observations that will revolutionize our ability to characterize the\natmospheric structure, composition, and circulation of these worlds. These\nimprovements stem from significant investments in new missions and facilities,\nsuch as JWST and the several planned ground-based extremely large telescopes.\nHowever, while exoplanet science currently has a wide range of sophisticated\nmodels that can be applied to the tide of forthcoming observations, the\ntrajectory for preparing these models for the upcoming observational challenges\nis unclear. Thus, our ability to maximize the insights gained from the next\ngeneration of observatories is not certain. In many cases, uncertainties in a\npath towards model advancement stems from insufficiencies in the laboratory\ndata that serve as critical inputs to atmospheric physical and chemical tools.\nWe outline a number of areas where laboratory or ab initio investigations could\nfill critical gaps in our ability to model exoplanet atmospheric opacities,\nclouds, and chemistry. Specifically highlighted are needs for: (1) molecular\nopacity linelists with parameters for a diversity of broadening gases, (2)\nextended databases for collision-induced absorption and dimer opacities, (3)\nhigh spectral resolution opacity data for relevant molecular species, (4)\nlaboratory studies of haze and condensate formation and optical properties, (5)\nsignificantly expanded databases of chemical reaction rates, and (6)\nmeasurements of gas photo-absorption cross sections at high temperatures. We\nhope that by meeting these needs, we can make the next two decades of exoplanet\nscience as productive and insightful as the previous two decades. (abr)\n", "  We study the liquid-gas phase transition of stellar matter with the inclusion\nof the finite-size effect from surface and Coulomb energies. The equilibrium\nconditions for two coexisting phases are determined by minimizing the total\nfree energy including the surface and Coulomb contributions, which are\ndifferent from the Gibbs conditions used in the bulk calculations. The\nfinite-size effect can significantly reduce the region of the liquid-gas mixed\nphase. The influence of the symmetry energy on the liquid-gas phase transition\nis investigated with the inclusion of finite-size effects. It is found that the\nslope of the symmetry energy plays an important role in determining the\nboundary and properties of the mixed phase.\n", "  Nonperturbative model of glueball is studied. The model is based on the\nnonperturbative quantization technique suggested by Heisenberg. 2- and 4-point\nGreen functions for a gauge potential are expressed in terms of two scalar\nfields. The first scalar field describes quantum fluctuations of the subgroup\n$SU(n) \\subset SU(N)$, and the second one describes quantum fluctuations of the\ncoset $SU(N) / SU(n)$. An effective Lagrangian for the scalar fields is\nobtained. The coefficients for all terms in the Lagrangian are calculated, and\nit is shown that they depend on $\\dim SU(n), \\dim SU(N)$. It is demonstrated\nthat a spherically symmetric solution describing the glueball does exist.\n", "  Assuming that Bogoluibov's theory of weakly interacting dilute Bose gas\ndefines a self-consistent model Hamiltonian, we investigate its thermodynamic\nlimit as we take the volume to infinity, the infinite volume is taken via a\nsequence of scaled convex regions with piecewise smooth boundary and the\nvolumes staying proportional to the cube of the diameter of the region. To get\na strict bound on the behavior of the thermodynamic limit, we use the recent\nformulation of Bogoluibov's theory of condensation in terms of heat kernels for\na given domain as well as an estimate of the difference of traces between the\nheat kernel with Neumann boundary conditions on this domain and the infinite\nspace result. We cannot control the limiting process by the area term, however\nwe can come arbitrarily close to it.\n", "  Experiments involving single or few elementary particles are completely\ndescribed by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that\nquantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and\nthe statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart\nfrom the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the\nmicroscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of\nuncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal\nvariable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a\nsymmetric role in the wave-function \\Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built\nand analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \\Psi (x,t) |^2,\nwhere the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is\nequivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of\nthe discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \\Psi\n(x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then\nwe discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal\nwavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving\nsingle and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the\nspread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in\ntwo-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and\ntemporal wavepackets.\n", "  We propose two improvements to the well-known power series method for\nconfined one-dimensional quantum-mechanical problems. They consist of the\naddition of a variational step were the energy plays the role of a variational\nparameter. We compare the rate of convergence of the three methods on an\nexactly-solvable model. We also outline possible generalizations of the\napproaches to more complex problems.\n", "  The past decade has been especially creative for spintronics since the\n(re)discovery of various two dimensional (2D) materials. Due to the unusual\nphysical characteristics, 2D materials have provided new platforms to probe the\nspin interaction with other degrees of freedom for electrons, as well as to be\nused for novel spintronics applications. This review briefly presents the most\nimportant recent and ongoing research for spintronics in 2D materials.\n", "  The purpose of these notes, based on a course given by the second author at\nLes Houches summer school, is to explain the probabilistic construction of\nPolyakov's Liouville quantum gravity using the theory of Gaussian\nmultiplicative chaos. In particular, these notes contain a detailed description\nof the so-called Liouville measures of the theory and their conjectured\nrelation to the scaling limit of large planar maps properly embedded in the\nsphere. These notes are rather short and require no prior knowledge on the\ntopic.\n", "  The equation of state of liquid metallic hydrogen is solved numerically.\nInvestigations are carried out at temperatures, which correspond both to the\nexperimental conditions under which metallic hydrogen is produced on earth and\nthe conditions in the cores of giant planets of the solar system such as\nJupiter and Saturn. It is assumed that hydrogen is in an atomic state and all\nits electrons are collectivized. Perturbation theory in the electron and proton\ninteraction is applied to determine the thermodynamic potentials of metallic\nhydrogen. The electron subsystem is considered in the randomphase approximation\nwith regard to the exchange interaction and the correlation of electrons in the\nlocal field approximation. The interproton interaction is taken into account in\nthe hard spheres approximation. The thermodynamic characteristics of metallic\nhydrogen are calculated with regard to the zero-, second-, and thirdorder\nperturbation theory terms. The third-order term proves to be rather essential\nat moderately high temperatures and densities, although it is much smaller than\nthe second-order term. The thermodynamic potentials of metallic hydrogen are\nmonotonically increasing functions of density and temperature. The values of\npressure for the temperatures and pressures that are characteristic of the\nconditions under which metallic hydrogen is produced on earth coincide with the\ncorresponding values reported by the discoverers of metallic hydrogen to a high\ndegree of accuracy. The temperature and density ranges are found in which there\nexists a liquid phase of metallic hydrogen.\n", "  The viscosity concept of thermal systems is borrowed to describe the\nflowability of granular powders in this article with the granular temperature\nis defined analogously. Eyrings rate process theory and free volume concept,\nwhich have been proved to be very powerful in dealing with many thermally\nactivated phenomena in a wide variety of fields, are utilized to derive\nviscosity equations of granular powders under a simple shear. The obtained\nviscosity equations are examined only with empirical experimental observations\nin describing powder flowability, due to the lack of instruments and\nmethodology for directly determining the viscosity of granular materials. The\ncontinuous shear thickening rather than the discontinuous shear thickening are\npredicted and found to be dependent on shear rate, the cohesive energy between\nparticles, and the particle volume fraction, though the discontinuous shear\nthickening may still occur if certain conditions are met during shear, such as\nlocal particle volume fractions approach to the jamming point created by the\nshear induced inhomogeneity. A fundamental mechanism on how dry granular\npowders flow is proposed on the basis of what are demonstrated from the\nviscosity equations.The work presented in this article may lay a foundation to\nscale powder flowability in a more fundamental and consistent manner, at least\nproviding an approach to consistently define the viscosity of granular powders.\nSince the same approaches are employed to derive the viscosity equations of\ngranular powders as used to derive viscosity equations of liquids, colloidal\nsuspensions, and polymeric materials, both athermal and thermal systems are\nthus unified with a single methodology.\n", "  With the passage of time, the development of communication technology and\ntransportation broke the isolation among people. Relationship tends to be\ncomplicated, pluralism, dynamism. In the network where interpersonal\nrelationship and evolved complex net based on game theory work serve\nrespectively as foundation architecture and theoretical model, with the\ncombination of game theory and regard public welfare as influencing factor, we\nartificially initialize that closed network system. Through continual loop\noperation of the program, we summarize the changing rule of the cooperative\nbehavior in the interpersonal relationship, so that we can analyze the policies\nabout welfare system about whole network and the relationship of frequency of\nbetrayal in cooperative behavior. Most analytical data come from some simple\ninvestigations and some estimates based on internet and environment and the\nstudy put emphasis on simulating social network and analyze influence of social\nwelfare system on Cooperative Behavio.\n", "  Introductory algebra-based physics courses frequently feature multiple\nstudent major populations in the same course section, however, different\nmajors' requirements may impact students' motivations towards different aspects\nof the course material, e.g. problem solving, and hence, impact course\nperformance. A preliminary categorization of student attitudes towards a lab\ngroup coordinated problem solving exercise, in which students individually\nreflect on their group-based problem attempt, is based upon students' written\ninterpretations about the usefulness of the exercise: respectively towards\nintrinsic value of a problem solving framework, towards performing well in the\ncourse, and towards less specific aspects of the exercise. The relationship\nbetween choice of major and this preliminary categorization for a typical\nalgebra-based physics course is analyzed, as are trends by major and by\ncategory type in a measure of course performance. We also discuss more in-depth\ndevelopment of interpretation for the categorization construct via written\nartifacts from the problem solving exercise.\n", "  We study the symmetries of the Lorentz violating Randers-Finsler spacetime.\nThe privileged frame defined by the background vector diagonalises the deformed\nmass-shell and provides an anisotropic observer transformations. The particle\nRanders transformations are achieved through the Finslerian Killing equation\nwhich also shows the equivalence between observer and particle Randers\ntransformation. For a constant background vector, the Randers transformations\ncan be regarded as a deformed directional-dependent Poincar\\'e transformation.\nThe Randers algebra is a deformed Poincar\\'e algebra whose structure\ncoefficients are given by the Randers metric. We propose a field theory\ninvariant over the Randers transformations. The dynamics exhibits nonlocal\noperators which yields to Lorentz violating terms of the nonminimal SME. The\nrelation and implications of the Randers algebra with other Lorentz violating\ntheories are discussed.\n", "  We argue that the physical constraints required by the association of the\nFermi GBM signal contemporaneous with GW150914 - radiative power of $10^{49} $\nerg s$^{-1}$, and corresponding magnetic fields on the black hole of the order\nof $10^{12}$ Gauss - are astrophysical highly implausible. Combined with the\nrelatively high random probability of coincidence of 0.22 percents, we conclude\nthat the electromagnetic signal is likely unrelated to the BH merger.\n", "  A combination of magnetic heat capacity measurements versus temperature under\nmultiple fixed external fields using a polycrystalline sample, plus easy and\nhard axis aligned magnetization versus field measurements using a single\ncrystal of the radical\n2-(4,5,6,7-tetrafluorobenzimidazol-2-yl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole-3-oxide-1-oxyl)\nat multiple fixed temperatures below 0.75 K, confirmed a zero-field Neel\ntemperature of TN(0) = 0.73 K, with extrapolated 0 K critical field parameters\nof Hc(parallel) = 170 Oe and Hc(perpendicular) = 306 Oe. Assuming the\npreviously determined 1D intrachain ferromagnetic exchange interaction of J =\n+22 K between radicals (Hamiltonian H = -2J {\\Sigma}Si . Sj), , the interchain\nexchange in antiferromagnetic with 2zJinter = -0.09 K.\n", "  We investigate the difficulties that students in calculus-based introductory\nphysics courses have with the concepts of symmetry, electric field, and\nelectric flux which are important for applying Gauss's law. The determination\nof the electric field using Gauss's law requires determining the symmetry of a\nparticular charge distribution and predicting the direction of the electric\nfield everywhere if a high symmetry exists. Effective application of Gauss's\nlaw implicitly requires understanding the principle of superposition for\nelectric fields. Helping students learn when Gauss's law can be readily applied\nto determine the strength of the electric field, and then helping them learn to\ndetermine the appropriate shape of Gaussian surfaces if sufficient symmetry\nexists, can help develop their reasoning and problem-solving skills. We\nadministered free-response and multiple-choice questions and conducted\ninterviews with individual students using a think-aloud protocol to elucidate\nthe difficulties that students have with the concepts of symmetry, electric\nfield, and electric flux. We also developed a multiple-choice test that targets\nthese conceptual issues to obtain quantitative information about their\ndifficulties and administered it to 541 students in the introductory\ncalculus-based physics courses and to upper-level undergraduates in an\nelectricity and magnetism course and to graduate students enrolled in a TA\nseminar course. We find that undergraduate students have many common\ndifficulties with these concepts.\n", "  The round-robin differential phase-shift quantum key distribution protocol\nprovides a secure way to exchange private information without monitoring\nconventional disturbances and still maintains a high tolerance of noise, making\nit desirable for practical implementations of quantum key distribution.\nHowever, photon number resolving detectors are required to ensure that the\ndetected signals are single photons in the original protocol. Here, we adopt\nthe detector-decoy method and give the bounds to the fraction of detected\nevents from single photons. Utilizing the advantages of the protocol, we\nprovide a practical method of performing the protocol with desirable\nperformances requiring only threshold single-photon detectors.\n", "  We examine the difficulties that introductory physics students, undergraduate\nphysics majors, and physics graduate students have with concepts related to\nconductors and insulators covered in introductory physics by giving written\ntests and interviewing a subset of students. We find that even graduate\nstudents have serious difficulties with these concepts. We develop tutorials\nrelated to these topics and evaluate their effectiveness by comparing the\nperformance on written pre-/post-tests and interviews of students who received\ntraditional instruction vs. those who learned using tutorials.\n", "  The fluorite to pyrochlore phase transition in La2Zr2O7 has been studied in\nthe literature for decades in the context of thermal barrier coatings and\nreinforcement materials. However, the nature of the phase transition in this\nsystem is still not well understood. In this article we have investigated the\nphase transition in La2Zr2O7, calcined at different temperatures, using powder\nx-ray diffraction and Raman measurements. Rietveld analyses of the x-ray data\nsuggest a fluorite to pyrochlore phase transition in the system occurring\nbetween 1000-1450oC. Nonetheless, Raman spectra, recorded with different\nexcitation wavelengths (\\lambda_ex) reveal that the dynamics of phase\ntransition is different in the near-surface region and in the bulk inside.\nWhile the near-surface region carried the signatures of a pure pyrochlore\nphase, the temperature dependent Raman measurements with \\lambda_ex=785 nm\nsuggest that locally formed oxygen related disordered states are present in the\nbulk of the system.\n", "  Pd site doping effect on superconductivity was investigated in\nquasi-one-dimensional superconductor Nb2(Pd1-xRx)0.76S5 (R=Ir, Ag) by measuring\nresistivity, magnetic susceptibility and Hall effect. It was found that\nsuperconducting transition temperature (Tc) is firstly slightly enhanced by\npartial substitution of Pd with Ir and then it is suppressed gradually as Ir\ncontent increases further. Meanwhile Ag substitution quickly suppresses the\nsystem to a nonsuperconducting ground state. Hall effect measurements indicate\nthe variations of charge carrier density caused by Ir or Ag doping. The\nestablished phase diagram implies that the charge carrier density (or the band\nfilling) could be one of the crucial controlling factors to determine Tc in\nthis system.\n", "  The presence of a switchable spontaneous electric polarization makes\nferroelectrics ideal candidates for the use in many applications such as memory\nand sensors devices. Since known ferroelectrics are rather limited, finding new\nferroelectric (FE) materials has become a flourishing field. One promising\nroute is to design the so-called hybrid improper ferroelectricity. However, the\nprevious approach based on the Landau theory is not easily adopted to the\nsystems that are unrelated to the Pbnm perovskite structure. To this end, we\ndevelop a general design rule that is applicable to any systems. By combining\nthis rule with density functional theory calculations, we identify previously\nunrecognized classes of FE materials. It shows that the R-3c perovskite\nstructure can become FE by substituting half of the B-site cations. ZnSrO2 with\na non-perovskite layered structure can also be FE through the anion\nsubstitution. Moreover, our approach can be used to design new multiferroics as\nillustrated in the case of fluorine substituted LaMnO3.\n", "  In 1960, Payne and Weinberger proved that among all domains that lie within a\nwedge (an angle whose measure is less than or equal to $\\pi$), and have a given\nvalue of a certain integral the circular sector has the lowest fundamental\neigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian. Here, it is shown that an analogue of\nthis assertion is true for domains with a cut and for indented domains; that\nis, for those located in a reflex angle (its measure is between $\\pi$ and $2\n\\pi$).\n", "  We present a calculation of $\\eta_{c}\\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}$ and\n$\\chi_{c0}\\rightarrow l^{+}l^{-}$ decay widths. The amplitudes are computed\nwithin leading-order approximation using NRQCD framework. Numerical results for\nthe branchings fractions are presented.\n", "  In recent years, millisecond duration radio signals originating from distant\ngalaxies appear to have been discovered in the so-called Fast Radio Bursts.\nThese signals are dispersed according to a precise physical law and this\ndispersion is a key observable quantity which, in tandem with a redshift\nmeasurement, can be used for fundamental physical investigations. While every\nfast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a\nredshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial\ncoordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the\nidentification of a fading radio transient lasting $\\sim 6$ days after the\nevent, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's\nredshift to be $z=0.492\\pm0.008$. The dispersion measure and redshift, in\ncombination, provide a direct measurement of the cosmic density of ionised\nbaryons in the intergalactic medium of $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{IGM}}=4.9 \\pm 1.3\\%$,\nin agreement with the expectation from WMAP, and including all of the so-called\n\"missing baryons\". The $\\sim6$-day transient is largely consistent with a short\ngamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support\nprogenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This\ncontrasts with the interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio\nburst, suggesting there are at least two classes of bursts.\n", "  We study the anisotropic Bianchi I loop quantum cosmology in 2+1 dimensions.\nBoth the $\\mubar$ and $\\mubar'$ schemes are considered in the present paper and\nthe following expected results are established: (i) the massless scalar field\nagain play the role of emergent time variables and serves as an internal clock;\n(ii) By imposing the fundamental discreteness of length operator, the total\nHamiltonian constraint is obtained and gives rise the evolution as a difference\nequation; and (iii) the exact solutions of Friedmann equation are constructed\nrigorously for both classical and effective level. The investigation extends\nthe domain of validity of loop quantum cosmology to beyond the four dimensions.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and has emerged\nas a key probe for the Dark Universe. Up till now this science has been\nconducted mainly at optical wavelengths. Current upgraded and future radio\nfacilities will provide greatly improved data that will allow lensing\nmeasurements to be made at these longer wavelengths. In this proceedings I show\nhow the larger facilities such as the SKA can produce game changing\ncosmological measurements even compared to future optical telescopes. I will\nalso discuss how radio surveys can also provide unique ways in which some of\nthe most problematic systematic errors can be mitigated through the extra\ninformation that can be provided in the form of polarisation and rotational\nvelocity measurements. I will also demonstrate the advantages to having\noverlapping optical and radio weak lensing surveys and how their\ncross-correlation leads to a cleaner extraction of the cosmological\ninformation. Key to the realisation of the great promise of radio weak lensing\nis the suitable measurements of galaxy shapes in the radio data, either from\nimages or from the visibility data. I shall end with a description of the key\nissues related to this matter and the radioGREAT challenge which has been\nproposed to address them.\n", "  The transfer of quantum entanglement (or quantum coherence) is not only\nfundamental in quantum mechanics but also important in quantum information\nprocessing. We here propose a way to achieve the coherent transfer of $W$-class\nentangled states of qubits among different cavities. Because no photon is\nexcited in each cavity, decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed\nduring the transfer. In addition, only one coupler qubit and one operational\nstep are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal, thus the\nengineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified.\nWe further give a numerical analysis, showing that high-fidelity transfer of a\nthree-qubit $W$ state is feasible within the present circuit QED technique. The\nproposal can be applied to a wide range of physical implementation with various\nqubits such as quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers, atoms, and\nsuperconducting qubits.\n", "  We obtain the centre-of-mass frame effective potential from the zero-momentum\npotential in Ruijsenaars-Schneider type 1-dimensional relativistic mechanics\nusing classical inverse scattering methods.\n", "  The propagation of very high energy gamma-rays ($E>100$~GeV) over\ncosmological distances is suppressed by pair-production processes with the\nubiquitous extra-galactic soft photon background, mainly in the optical to near\ninfra-red. The detailed spectroscopy of gamma-ray emitting blazars has revealed\nthe signature of this absorption process leading to a meaningful measurement of\nthe background photon field which is linked to the star-forming history of the\nuniverse. Deviations from the expected absorption have been claimed in the\npast. Here the status of the observations is summarized, an update on the\nsearch for the persisting anomalous transparency is given and discussed.\n", "  Some critical open problems of epistemic logics can be investigated in the\nframework of a quantum computational approach. The basic idea is to interpret\nsentences - like Alice knows that Bob does not understand that Pi is irrational\n- as pieces of quantum information (generally represented by density operators\nof convenient Hilbert spaces). Logical epistemic operators (to understand, to\nknow ...) are dealt with as (generally irreversible) quantum operations, which\nare, in a sense, similar to measurement-procedures. This approach permits us to\nmodel some characteristic epistemic processes, that concern both human and\nartificial intelligence. For instance, the operation of \\memorizing and\nretrieving information\" can be formally represented, in this framework, by\nusing a quantum teleportation phenomenon.\n", "  Quantum information has suggested new forms of quantum logic, called quantum\ncomputational logics, where meanings of sentences are represented by pieces of\nquantum information (generally, density operators of some Hilbert spaces),\nwhich can be stored and transmitted by means of quantum particles. This\napproach can be applied to a semantic characterization of epistemic logical\noperations, which may occur in sentences like \"At time t0 Bob knows that at\ntime t Alice knows that the spin-value is up\". Each epistemic agent (say,\nAlice, Bob,...) has a characteristic truth-perspective, corresponding to a\nparticular orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C^2. From a physical point of\nview, a truth-perspective can be associated to an apparatus that allows one to\nmeasure a given observable. An important feature that characterizes the\nknowledge of any agent is the amount of information that is accessible to\nhim/her (technically, a special set of density operators, which also represents\nthe internal memory of the agent in question). One can prove that interesting\nepistemic operations are special examples of quantum channels, which generally\nare not unitary. The act of knowing may involve some intrinsic irreversibility\ndue to possible measurement procedures or to a loss of information about the\nenvironment. We also illustrate some relativistic-like effects that arise in\nthe behavior of epistemic agents.\n", "  Quantum computational logics represent a logical abstraction from the\ncircuit-theory in quantum computation. In these logics formulas are supposed to\ndenote pieces of quantum information (qubits, quregisters or mixtures of\nquregisters), while logical connectives correspond to (quantum logical) gates\nthat transform quantum information in a reversible way. The characteristic\nholistic features of the quantum theoretic formalism (which play an essential\nrole in entanglement-phenomena) can be used in order to develop a holistic\nversion of the quantum computational semantics. In contrast with the\ncompositional character of most standard semantic approaches, meanings of\nformulas are here dealt with as global abstract objects that determine the\ncontextual meanings of the formulas' components (from the whole to the parts).\nWe present a survey of the most significant logical arguments that are valid or\nthat are possibly violated in the framework of this semantics. Some logical\nfeatures that may appear prima facie strange seem to reflect pretty well\ninformal arguments that are currently used in our rational activity.\n", "  By using the abstract structures investigated in the first Part of this\narticle, we develop a semantics for an epistemic language, which expresses\nsentences like \"Alice knows that Bob does not understand that PI is\nirrational\". One is dealing with a holistic form of quantum computational\nsemantics, where entanglement plays a fundamental role, thus, the meaning of a\nglobal expression determines the contextual meanings of its parts, but\ngenerally not the other way around. The epistemic situations represented in\nthis semantics seem to reflect some characteristic limitations of the real\nprocesses of acquiring information. Since knowledge is not generally closed\nunder logical consequence, the unpleasant phenomenon of logical omniscience is\nhere avoided.\n", "  We give a basic introduction to ghost-free nonlinear theories involving\nmassive spin-2 fields, focussing on bimetric theory. After motivating the\nconstruction of such models from field theoretical considerations, we review\nthe linear theories for massive and massless spin-2 fluctuations propagating on\nmaximally symmetric backgrounds. The structure of general nonlinear spin-2\ninteractions is explained before we specialise to the ghost-free case. We\nreview the maximally symmetric solutions of bimetric theory, its mass spectrum\nand the parameter limit which brings the theory close to general relativity.\nFinally we discuss applications of bimetric theory to cosmology with particular\nemphasis on the role of the general relativity limit.\n", "  Recently, it has been shown that while asperity models show correctly\nqualitative features of rough contact problems (linearity in area-load,\nnegative exponential dependence of load on separation which means also\nlinearity of stiffness with load), the exact value of the coefficients are not\nprecise for the idealized case of Gaussian distribution of heigths. This is due\nto the intrinsic simplifications, neglecting asperity coalescence and\ninteraction effects. However, the issue of Gaussianity has not been proved or\nexperimentally verified in many cases, and here we show that, for example,\nassuming a Weibull distribution of asperity heigths, the area-load linear\ncoefficient is not much affected, while the relationships load-separation and\ntherefore also stiffness-load do change largely, particularly when considering\nbounded distributions of asperity heigths. It is suggested that Gaussianity of\nsurfaces should be further tested in experiments, before applying the most\nsophisticated rough contact models based on the Gaussian assumption.\n", "  The detailed understanding of the antineutrino emission from research\nreactors is mandatory for any high sensitivity experiments either for\nfundamental or applied neutrino physics, as well as a good control of the gamma\nand neutron backgrounds induced by the reactor operation. In this article, the\nantineutrino emission associated to a thermal research reactor: the OSIRIS\nreactor located in Saclay, France, is computed in a first part. The calculation\nis performed with the summation method, which sums all the contributions of the\nbeta decay branches of the fission products, coupled for the first time with a\ncomplete core model of the OSIRIS reactor core. The MCNP Utility for Reactor\nEvolution code was used, allowing to take into account the contributions of all\nbeta decayers in-core. This calculation is representative of the isotopic\ncontributions to the antineutrino flux which can be found at research reactors\nwith a standard 19.75\\% enrichment in $^{235}$U. In addition, the required\noff-equilibrium corrections to be applied to converted antineutrino energy\nspectra of uranium and plutonium isotopes are provided. In a second part, the\ngamma energy spectrum emitted at the core level is provided and could be used\nas an input in the simulation of any reactor antineutrino detector installed at\nsuch research facilities. Furthermore, a simulation of the core surrounded by\nthe pool and the concrete shielding of the reactor has been developed in order\nto propagate the emitted gamma rays and neutrons from the core. The origin of\nthese gamma rays and neutrons is discussed and the associated energy spectrum\nof the photons transported after the concrete walls is displayed.\n", "  We study the challenges to detect the cosmic web at radio wavelengths with\nstate-of-the-art cosmological simulations of extragalactic magnetic fields. The\nincoming generation of radio surveys operating at low frequency, like LOFAR,\nSKA-LOW and MWA will have the best chance to detect the large-scale, low\nsurface brightness emission from the shocked cosmic web. The detected radio\nemission will enable to constrain the average magnetisation level of the gas in\nfilaments and the acceleration efficiency of electrons by strong shocks. In\ncase of detections, through statistical modelling (e.g. correlation functions)\nit will be possible to discriminate among competing scenarios for the\nmagnetisation of large-scale structures (i.e. astrophysical versus primordial\nscenarios), making radio surveys an important probe of cosmic magnetogenesis.\n", "  The recently discovered twist-bend nematic phase, $\\rm N_{tb}$, is a\nnon-uniform equilibrium nematic phase that presents a spontaneous bend with a\nprecession of the nematic director, $\\textbf{n}$, on a conical helix with a\ntilt angle $\\theta$ and helical pitch $P$. The stability of the $\\rm N_{tb}$\nphase has been recently demonstrated from the elastic point of view by\nextending the Frank elastic energy density of the nematic phase to include the\nsymmetry element of helical axis, $\\bf t$. In the present communication, we\ninvestigate the influence of an external bulk field (magnetic or electric) on\nthe pitch of the $\\rm N_{tb}$ phase. For a material with positive magnetic\nsusceptibility anisotropy, when the magnetic field $\\bf{H}$ is parallel to the\nhelical axis, $\\bf{t}$, the field modifies the coupling parameter between the\ndirector and the helical axis, thus shifting the interval of values for which\nthis coupling results in the $\\rm N_{tb}$ phase. If $\\bf{H}$ is perpendicular\nto $\\bf{t}$, it is shown that the pitch of the nematic director $\\bf n$\nprecession increases with $\\bf{H}$, and at a critical value of $H_c$ it becomes\ninfinite as in a cholesteric liquid crystal, that is, one gets a uniform\norientation of n. Our results include the behaviour of a cholesteric under\nfield as a limiting case.\n", "  The study of this paper demonstrates that electron has Dirac delta like\ninternal momentum (u,p_{{\\theta}}), going round in a circle of radius equal to\nhalf the reduced Compton wavelength of electron with tangential velocity c. The\ncircular momentum p_{{\\theta}} and energy u emanate from circular Dirac delta\ntype rotating monochromatic electromagnetic (EM) wave that itself travels in\nanother circle having radius equal to the reduced Compton wavelength of\nelectron. The phenomenon of Zitterbewegung and the spin of electron are the\nnatural consequences of the model. The spin is associated with the internal\ncirculating momentum of electron in terms of four component spinor, which leads\nto the Dirac equation linking the EM electron model with quantum mechanical\ntheory. Our model accurately explains the experimental results of electron\nchannelling experiment, [P. Catillon et al., Found.Phys. 38, 659 (2008)], in\nwhich the momentum resonance is observed at 161.784MeV/c corresponding to\nZitterbewegung frequency of 80.874MeV/c electron beam.\n", "  We compute the contact resistances $R_{\\rm c}$ in trigate and FinFET devices\nwith widths and heights in the 4 to 24 nm range using a Non-Equilibrium Green's\nFunctions approach. Electron-phonon, surface roughness and Coulomb scattering\nare taken into account. We show that $R_{\\rm c}$ represents a significant part\nof the total resistance of devices with sub-30 nm gate lengths. The analysis of\nthe quasi-Fermi level profile reveals that the spacers between the heavily\ndoped source/drain and the gate are major contributors to the contact\nresistance. The conductance is indeed limited by the poor electrostatic control\nover the carrier density under the spacers. We then disentangle the ballistic\nand diffusive components of $R_{\\rm c}$, and analyze the impact of different\ndesign parameters (cross section and doping profile in the contacts) on the\nelectrical performances of the devices. The contact resistance and variability\nrapidly increase when the cross sectional area of the channel goes below\n$\\simeq 50$ nm$^2$. We also highlight the role of the charges trapped at the\ninterface between silicon and the spacer material.\n", "  In this experimental and theoretical study, we examine the equilibrium shapes\nof quasitwo-dimensional twist-bend nematic (Ntb) drops formed within a planarly\naligned nematic layer of the liquid crystal CB7CB. Initially, at the setting\npoint of the Ntb phase, the drops assume a nonequilibrium cusped elliptical\ngeometry with the major axis orthogonal to the director of the surrounding\nnematic fluid; this growth is governed principally by anisotropic heat\ndiffusion. The drops attain equilibrium through thermally driven dynamical\nevolutions close to their melting temperature. They are associated with a\ncharacteristic twin-striped morphology that transforms into the familiar focal\nconic texture as the temperature is lowered. At equilibrium, large millimetric\ndrops are tactoidlike, elongated along the director of the surrounding nematic\nfluid. This geometry is explained by a mathematical model that features two\ndimensionless parameters, of which one is the structural cone angle of the Ntb\nphase and the other, the relative strength of mismatch elastic energy at the\ndrop's interface. Both parameters are extracted from the observations by\nmeasuring the aspect ratio of the equilibrium shapes and the inner corner angle\nof the cusps.\n", "  Matter-wave interferometry has become an essential tool in studies on the\nfoundations of quantum physics and for precision measurements. Mechanical\ngratings have played an important role as coherent beamsplitters for atoms,\nmolecules and clusters since the basic diffraction mechanism is the same for\nall particles. However, polarizable objects may experience van der Waals shifts\nwhen they pass the grating walls and the undesired dephasing may prevent\ninterferometry with massive objects. Here we explore how to minimize this\nperturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate\nphysical limit, i.e. the thickness of a single atom. We have fabricated\ndiffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in 1 nm thin\ncarbonaceous biphenyl membrane. We identify conditions to transform an array of\nsingle layer graphene nanoribbons into a grating of carbon nanoscrolls. We show\nthat all these ultra-thin nanomasks can be used for high-contrast quantum\ndiffraction of massive molecules. They can be seen as a nanomechanical answer\nto the question debated by Bohr and Einstein whether a softly suspended double\nslit would destroy quantum interference. In agreement with Bohr's reasoning we\nshow that quantum coherence prevails even in the limit of atomically thin\ngratings.\n", "  We present the results of the first high-altitude balloon flight test of a\nconcept for an advanced Compton telescope making use of modern scintillator\nmaterials with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) readouts. There is a need in the\nfields of high-energy astronomy and solar physics for new medium-energy\ngamma-ray (~0.4 - 10 MeV) detectors capable of making sensitive observations. A\nfast scintillator- based Compton telescope with SiPM readouts is a promising\nsolution to this instrumentation challenge, since the fast response of the\nscintillators permits the rejection of background via time-of-flight (ToF)\ndiscrimination. The Solar Compton Telescope (SolCompT) prototype was designed\nto demonstrate stable performance of this technology under balloon-flight\nconditions. The SolCompT instrument was a simple two-element Compton telescope,\nconsisting of an approximately one-inch cylindrical stilbene crystal for a\nscattering detector and a one-inch cubic LaBr3:Ce crystal for a calorimeter\ndetector. Both scintillator detectors were read out by 2 x 2 arrays of\nHamamatsu S11828-3344 MPPC devices. Custom front-end electronics provided\noptimum signal rise time and linearity, and custom power supplies automatically\nadjusted the SiPM bias voltage to compensate for temperature-induced gain\nvariations. A tagged calibration source, consisting of ~240 nCi of Co-60\nembedded in plastic scintillator, was placed in the field of view and provided\na known source of gamma rays to measure in flight. The SolCompT balloon payload\nwas launched on 24 August 2014 from Fort Sumner, NM, and spent ~3.75 hours at a\nfloat altitude of ~123,000 feet. The instrument performed well throughout the\nflight. After correcting for small (~10%) residual gain variations, we measured\nan in-flight ToF resolution of ~760 ps (FWHM). Advanced scintillators with SiPM\nreadouts continue to show great promise for future gamma-ray instruments.\n", "  Caloric responses (temperature changes) can be induced in solid-state\nmaterials by applying external stimuli such as stress, pressure, and electric\nand magnetic fields. The magnetic-field-stimulated response is called the\nmagnetocaloric effect, and materials that exhibit this property have long been\nsought for applications in room temperature magnetic cooling due to their\npotentially superior efficiency and low impact on the environment. Other\nsolid-state caloric phenomena are less developed, but are likewise under\nintense investigation. Here we introduce a new material that not only displays\ngiant barocaloric (hydrostatic-pressure-induced) properties, but also a large\nmagnetocaloric response near room temperature. It is unprecedented that two\ncaloric effects of such extreme magnitude occur in the same material and at the\nsame temperature. These effects originate from a magnetostructural transition\nand a magneto-volume (magnetostriction) effect where the volume change is large\nenough to force the system from a localized ordered state into an itinerant\nparamagnetic state.\n", "  We study a planar thin brittle beam subject to elastic deformations and\ncracks described in terms of a nonlinear Griffith energy functional acting on\n$SBV$ deformations of the beam. In particular we consider the case in which\nelastic bulk contributions due to finite bending of the beam are comparable to\nthe surface energy which is necessary to completely break the beam into several\nlarge pieces. In the limit of vanishing aspect ratio we rigorously derive an\neffective Griffith-Euler-Bernoulli functional which acts on piecewise $W^{2,2}$\nregular curves representing the midline of the beam. The elastic part of this\nfunctional is the classical Euler-Bernoulli functional for thin beams in the\nbending dominated regime in terms of the curve's curvature. In addition there\nalso emerges a fracture term proportional to the number of discontinuities of\nthe curve and its first derivative.\n", "  RX J1131-1231 is a gravitationally lensed system which includes four images\nof a quasar lensed by an elliptical galaxy. The flux in the individual images\nis known to be affected by microlensing effect in the visible and X-ray bands.\nWe study the multi-wavelength properties of RX J1131-1231 over a broad energy\nrange, from optical to hard X-ray, during the periods of the microlensing\ncaustic crossings. We aim to constrain the spatial extent of the X-ray emission\nregion at different energies. We combine the data of the source monitoring in\nthe visible band with the X-ray data of the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on\nboard of SWIFT satellite and Chandra X-ray observatory. Inspecting the broad\nband spectrum and lightcurves of the source we identify several microlensing\ncaustic crossing events, and study the details of variability of the source\nduring these events. The caustic crossings of image A on MJD 55150 and 55500\nproduce strong variations of the overall X-ray flux from the source. In the\nsoft X-ray band, the caustic crossing events are characterised by the\nexponential growth / decay of the flux ratio between the source images with the\nexponentiating time scale T_d~60 d, which corresponds to the caustic transit\ntime of the source of the size ~10^{14} cm. Variability induced by the\nmicrolensing dominates the overall variability of the sum of the fluxes of four\nimages of the source which should also be detectable in the hard X-ray\nlightcurve, if the hard X-ray source is comparably compact. Non-detection of\nthe caustic crossing events in the SWIFT/BAT lightcurve of the source indicates\nthat geometry of the region of emission of X-rays with energies above 15 keV is\ndifferent from that of the lower energy X-rays, with the hard X-ray emission an\norder of magnitude larger in size.\n", "  The security issues facing quantum key distribution (QKD) are explained,\nherein focusing on those issues that are cryptographic and information\ntheoretic in nature and not those based on physics. The problem of security\ncriteria is addressed. It is demonstrated that an attacker's success\nprobabilities are the fundamental criteria of security that any theoretic\nsecurity criterion must relate to in order to have operational significance.\nThe errors committed in the prevalent interpretation of the trace distance\ncriterion are analyzed. The security proofs of QKD protocols are discussed and\nassessed in regard to three main features: their validity, completeness, and\nadequacy of the achieved numerical security level. Problems are identified in\nall these features. It appears that the QKD security situation is quite\ndifferent from the common perception that a QKD-generated key is nearly\nperfectly secure. Built into our discussion is a simple but complete\nquantitative description of the information theoretic security of classical key\ndistribution that is also applicable to the quantum situation. In the\nappendices, we provide a brief outline of the history of some major QKD\nsecurity proofs, a rather unfavorable comparison of current QKD proven security\nwith that of conventional symmetric key ciphers, and a list of objections and\nanswers concerning some major points of the paper.\n", "  Each step in a quantum random walk is typically understood to have two basic\ncomponents; a `coin-toss' which produces a random superposition of two states,\nand a displacement which moves each component of the superposition by different\namounts. Here we suggest the realization of a walk in momentum space with a\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensate subject to a quantum ratchet realized with a\npulsed, off-resonant optical lattice. By an appropriate choice of the lattice\ndetuning, we show how the atomic momentum can be entangled with the internal\nspin states of the atoms. For the coin-toss, we propose to use a microwave\npulse to mix these internal states. We present experimental results showing an\noptimized quantum ratchet, and through a series of simulations, demonstrate how\nour proposal gives extraordinary control of the quantum walk. This should allow\nfor the investigation of possible biases, and classical-to-quantum dynamics in\nthe presence of natural and engineered noise.\n", "  In this paper we argue for a paradigmatic shift from `reductionism' to\n`togetherness'. In particular, we show how interaction between systems in\nquantum theory naturally carries over to modelling how word meanings interact\nin natural language. Since meaning in natural language, depending on the\nsubject domain, encompasses discussions within any scientific discipline, we\nobtain a template for theories such as social interaction, animal behaviour,\nand many others.\n", "  Solutions of nonlinear acoustic equations describing propagation of strong\nsound pulses with account of curvature of wave fronts in multi-dimensional\ngeometry are obtained from simple physical considerations. The form of these\nsolutions suggests ansatz suitable for finding solutions of much more general\nequations of Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya type. General method is illustrated by an\nexample of nonlinear sound pulse focused in one transverse direction and\ndefocused in the other direction.\n", "  It has been found that activation of a stereotype, for example by indicating\none's gender before a test, typically alters performance in a way consistent\nwith the stereotype, an effect called \"stereotype threat\". On a standardized\nconceptual physics assessment, we found that asking test takers to indicate\ntheir gender right before taking the test did not deteriorate performance\ncompared to an equivalent group who did not provide gender information.\nAlthough a statistically significant gender gap was present on the standardized\ntest whether or not students indicated their gender, no gender gap was observed\non the multiple-choice final exam students took, which included both\nquantitative and conceptual questions on similar topics.\n", "  In this work, we present a computational study on the possibility of strain\nengineering in monolayer Black Phosphorus (black P) and Blue Phosphorus (blue\nP) based MOSFETs. The material properties like band structure, carrier\neffective masses, carrier densities at band extrema are evaluated using\nGeneralized Gradient Approximation (GGA) in Density Functional Theory\n(DFT).Thereafter self-consistent Non-Equilibrium Greens Function (NEGF)\nsimulations are carried out to study the device performance metrics (such as\noutput characteristics, ON currents, transconductance etc.) of such strained\nblack P and blue P based MOSFETs. Our simulations show that carrier effective\nmasses in blue P are more sensitive to strain applied in both zigzag and\narmchair directions. Blue P is more responsive in strain engineering for n-MOS\nand p-MOS. Except for black P based FETs with strain in armchair direction,\noverall the blue P (black P) n-MOSFET (p-MOSFET) show moderate to significant\nimprovement in performance with tensile (compressive) strain in the transport\ndirections.\n", "  The Ehrenfest equation is derived rigorously for the case when an 'effective'\nvolume V* = AV of the strained solids is a continuous function of the\ntemperature. The Ehrenfest equation for strained solids is generalized to an\narbitrary temperature. Far from 0 K (in contrast to the situation near 0 K) the\nphase transition temperature derivative with respect to uniaxial pressure\ndepends on the temperature expansion coefficient of an ' effective' volume. For\nRochelle salt strained by a uniaxial pressure at room temperature the\npredominant contribution into this dependence is made by the coefficient A. At\nthe second order phase transition under uniaxial pressure the 'effective' (but\nnot true) volume is the continuous function of the temperature. The Ehrenfest\nequation for solids strained by hydrostatic pressure can be presented as a sum\nof three linear parts proportional to the crystal linear thermal expansion\ncoefficients along the axes a, b, c. These parts are equal to the second order\ntransition temperature derivative with respect to hydrostatic (but not\nuniaxial) pressure,\n", "  The effect of the initial uniaxial stress and a surrounding elastic matrix on\nthe transverse vibration response of a single-layered graphene sheet (SLGS) is\ninvestigated through a theoretical formulation that is based on the nonlocal\nKirchhoff plate theory. The surrounding elastic matrix of the SLGS is modeled\nas a foundation of the Pasternak-type. The elliptic partial differential\nequation governing the dynamics of the pre-stressed SLGS is solved with the\nRayleigh method. Numerical results from the analyses reveal different level of\nsensitivity of the vibration response of the SLGS to changes in the control\nparameters of the model. Pareto charts of the effect of the control parameters\nin the mathematical model show the shear modulus of the foundation to have the\nmost dominant influence on the fundamental natural frequency of the SLGS. The\nsmall-scale effect is found to have more pronounced effect on the vibration\nresponse of the SLGS when it is fully clamped at the four edges.\n", "  We analyze the effectiveness of working in pairs on the Conceptual Survey of\nElectricity and Magnetism test in a calculus-based introductory physics course.\nStudents who collaborated with a peer showed significantly larger normalized\ngain on individual testing than those who did not collaborate. We did not find\nstatistically significant differences between the performance of students who\nwere given an opportunity to formulate their own response before the peer\ndiscussions, compared to those who were not. Peer collaboration also shows\nevidence for co-construction of knowledge. Discussions with individual students\nshow that students themselves value peer interaction. We discuss the effect of\npairing students with different individual achievements.\n", "  Motivated by the emergence of materials with mean free paths on the order of\nmicrons, we propose a novel class of solid state radiation sources based on\nreimplementing classical vacuum tube designs in semiconductors. Using materials\nwith small effective masses, these devices should be able to access the\nterahertz range. We analyze the DC and AC operation of the simplest such\ndevice, the cylindrical diode magnetron, using effective quantum models. By\ntreating the magnetron as an open quantum system, we show that it continues to\noperate as a radiation source even if its diameter is only a few tens of\nmagnetic lengths.\n", "  The relentless efforts of the physics community has not yet availed us the\nsolution of how to unify the Quantum Mechanics with General Relativity, a\npuzzle that has engaged the minds of the physicists for almost a century. The\ninsufficiency of today's and foreseeable future's technology for a direct reach\ninto the Planck energies at which the fundamental theory, the Quantum Theory of\nGravity, lies has lead to the search of the low energy effects of that\nfundamental Planck level theory irregardless of the details of it. In this\nthesis, one of the leading candidates of such an exotic effect, that is the\nviolation of Lorentz and CPT symmetries is analyzed. The action level effective\nfield theoretical framework for such an analysis called Standard Model\nExtension has already been in the literature for the last two decades; here,\nthe nonminimal photon sector of such a framework is examined from a quantum\nfield theoretical point of view. All possible polarization vectors for\ndifferent kinds of CPT violations, the generic forms of the dispersion\nrelations that these polarization vectors satisfy, and the corresponding\npropagators of the photon field are explicitly calculated. Special models of\nLorentz violations are introduced, and a particular one called vacuum\northogonal model is analyzed extensively. It is found that this particular form\nof Lorentz violation cannot induce any effects that is detectable in the vacuum\npropagation of the photon. Isotropic and leading order cases of the Lorentz\nviolation is studied and this found result is explicitly shown.\n", "  We describe how graduate students categorize introductory mechanics problems\nbased on the similarity of their solutions. Graduate students were asked at the\nend of a teaching assistant training class to categorize problems from their\nown perspective and from the perspective of typical introductory physics\nstudents whom they were teaching. We compare their categorizations with the\ncategorizations by introductory physics students and physics faculty who\ncategorized the same problems. The utility of categorization as a tool for\nteaching assistant training and faculty development workshops is discussed.\n", "  In this companion paper, we explore the use of isomorphic problem pairs\n(IPPs) to assess introductory physics students' ability to solve and\nsuccessfully transfer problem-solving knowledge from one context to another in\nmechanics. We call the paired problems \"isomorphic\" because they require the\nsame physics principle to solve them. We analyze written responses and\nindividual discussions to a range of isomorphic problems. We examine potential\nfactors that may help or hinder transfer of problem-solving skills from one\nproblem in a pair to the other. For some paired isomorphic problems, one\ncontext often turned out to be easier for students in that it was more often\ncorrectly solved than the other. When quantitative and conceptual questions\nwere paired and given back to back, students who answered both questions in the\nIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered\nthe corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took\nadvantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an\nIPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried\nto convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the\nsolution conceptually. Misconceptions associated with friction in some problems\nwere so robust that pairing them with isomorphic problems not involving\nfriction did not help students discern their underlying similarities.\nAlternatively, from the knowledge in pieces perspective, the activation of the\nknowledge resource related to friction was so strongly and automatically\ntriggered by the context, which is outside the conscious control of the\nstudent, that students did not look for analogies with paired problems or other\naids that may be present.\n", "  The ability to categorize problems based upon underlying principles, rather\nthan contexts, is considered a hallmark of expertise in physics problem\nsolving. With inspiration from a classic study by Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser,\nwe compared the categorization of 25 introductory mechanics problems based upon\nsimilarity of solution by students in large calculus-based introductory courses\nwith physics faculty and Ph.D. students. Here, we summarize the study and\nsuggest that a categorization task, especially when conducted with students\nworking with peers in small groups, can be an effective pedagogical tool to\nhelp students in introductory physics courses learn to discern the underlying\nsimilarity between problems with diverse contexts but the same underlying\nphysics principles.\n", "  Different novel organic-chemical possibilities for tetrahedral building units\nare considered, with attention to their utility in constructing different\nsuper-structures. As a representative construction we consider the use of sets\nof 20 such identical tetrahedral units to form a super-dodecahedron.\n", "  We examine the effect of misconceptions about friction on students' ability\nto solve problems and transfer from one context to another. We analyze written\nresponses to paired isomorphic problems given to introductory physics students\nand discussions with a subset of students. Misconceptions associated with\nfriction in problems were sometimes so robust that pairing them with isomorphic\nproblems not involving friction did not help students fully discern their\nunderlying similarities.\n", "  Synchrotron emission from a supernova necessitates a magnetic field, but it\nis unknown how strong the relevant magnetic fields are, and what mechanism\ngenerates them. In this study, we perform high-resolution numerical gas\ndynamics calculations to determine the growth of turbulence due to\nRayleigh-Taylor instability, and the resulting kinetic energy in turbulent\nfluctuations, to infer the strength of magnetic fields amplified by this\nturbulence. We find that Rayleigh-Taylor instability can produce turbulent\nfluctuations strong enough to amplify magnetic fields to a few percent of\nequipartition with the thermal energy. This turbulence stays concentrated near\nthe reverse shock, but averaging this magnetic energy throughout the shocked\nregion (weighting by emissivity) sets the magnetic fields at a minimum of 0.3\npercent of equipartition. This suggests a minimum effective magnetic field\nstrength ($\\epsilon_B > 0.003$) which should be present in all interacting\nsupernovae.\n", "  We propose that the SU(2) x SU(2) x U(1) (aka G221) models could provide us a\n750 GeV scalar resonance that may account for the diphoton excess observed at\nthe LHC while satisfying present collider constraints. The neutral component of\nthe $SU(2)_R$ scalar multiplet can be identified as the 750 GeV scalar. In the\nlepto-phobic and fermio-phobic G221 models the new charged gauge boson W' could\nbe light, and we find that the diphoton decay width could be dominated by the\nloop contribution from the $W'$. To initiate gluon fusion production, it is\nnecessary to extend the G221 symmetry to the Pati-Salam and SO(10) symmetry. We\ninvestigate the possibilities that the light colored scalars or vectorlike\nfermions survive in the SO(10) theory and provide large gluon fusion rate for\nthe diphoton signature. It is possible to test the G221 interpretation by\ndirect searches of W' using the multi-gauge boson production channel at the Run\n2 LHC.\n", "  The Speedster-EXD is a new 64x64 pixel, 40 $\\mu$m pixel pitch, 100 $\\mu$m\ndepletion depth hybrid CMOS X-ray detector (HCD) with the capability of reading\nout only those pixels containing event charge, thus enabling fast effective\nframe rates. A global charge threshold can be specified, and pixels containing\ncharge above this threshold are flagged and read out. The Speedster detector\nhas also been designed with other advanced in-pixel features to improve\nperformance, including a low-noise, high-gain CTIA amplifier that eliminates\ninterpixel capacitance crosstalk (IPC), and in-pixel Correlated Double Sampling\n(CDS) subtraction to reduce reset noise. We measure the best energy resolution\non the Speedster-EXD detector to be 206 eV (3.5 %) at 5.89 keV and 172 eV (10.0\n%) at 1.49 keV. The average IPC to the four adjacent pixels is measured to be\n0.25 $\\pm$ 0.2 % (i.e. consistent with zero). The pixel-to-pixel gain variation\nis measured to be 0.80 $\\pm$ 0.03 %, and a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to\nbetter characterize the contributions to the energy resolution.\n", "  In this thesis we study the phenomenon of superradiance and its implications\nto the stability of black-holes (BH) and perfect-fluid stars.\n  Superradiance is a radiation enhancement process that involves rotating\ndissipative systems. In BH spacetimes, superradiance is due to dissipation at\nthe event horizon, with interesting associated phenomena, namely floating\norbits and BH-bombs. BH superradiance is a very interdisciplinary topic, and\nits study allows us to obtain important results in the area of particle\nphysics. The scattering of a scalar field by a rotating BH leads to the\nformation of quasi-boundstates. In rotational systems, these states can give\nrise to superradiant instabilities. These results were recently used to impose\nconstraints to the mass of fundamental particles and darkmatter candidates.\n  In this work, it is shown that, when dissipation is properly included,\nsimilar results are achievable in self-gravitating systems other than\nblack-holes, such as perfect fluid stars. It is also demonstrated that the\nrelativistic effects related to the phenomenon of frame-dragging are\nneglectable in this calculation.\n", "  Helping students learn why Gauss' law can or cannot be easily applied to\ndetermine the strength of the electric field at various points for a particular\ncharge distribution, and then helping them learn to determine the shape of the\nGaussian surfaces if sufficient symmetry exists can develop their reasoning and\nproblem solving skills. We investigate the difficulties that students in\ncalculus-based introductory physics courses have with the concepts of symmetry,\nelectric field and electric flux that are pivotal to Gauss' law of electricity.\nDetermination of the electric field using Gauss' law requires discerning the\nsymmetry of a particular charge distribution and being able to predict the\ndirection of the electric field everywhere if a high symmetry exists. It\nrequires a good grasp of how to add the electric field vectors using the\nprinciple of superposition, and the concepts of area vector and electric flux.\nWe administered free response and multiple-choice questions and conducted\ninterviews with individual students using a think-aloud protocol to elucidate\nthe difficulties students have with the concepts of symmetry, electric field\nand electric flux. Here, we discuss student responses to some questions on a\nmultiple-choice test administered to them. The test can be used as a teaching\nand assessment tool.\n", "  Phonon Monte Carlo (PMC) is a versatile stochasic technique for solving the\nBoltzmann transport equation for phonons. It is particularly well suited for\nanalyzing thermal transport in structures that have real-space roughness or are\ntoo large to simulate directly using atomistic techniques. PMC hinges on the\ngeneration and use of \\textit{random variates} -- specific values of the random\nvariables that correspond to physical observables -- in a way that accurately\nand efficiently captures the appropriate distribution functions. We present the\nrelative merits of the inversion and rejection techniques for generating random\nvariates on several examples relevant in thermal transport: drawing phonons\nfrom a thermal distribution and with full or isotropic dispersion, randomizing\noutgoing momentum upon diffuse boundary scattering, implementing contacts\n(boundary and internal), and conserving energy in the simulation. We also\nidentify common themes in phonon generation and scattering that are helpful for\nreusing code in the simulation (generating thermal-phonon attributes vs\ninternal contacts; diffuse surface scattering vs boundary contacts). We hope\nthese examples will inform the reader about the mechanics of random-variate\ngeneration and how to choose a good approach for whatever problem is at hand,\nand aid in the more widespread use of PMC for thermal transport simulation.\n", "  Radio pulsars are unique laboratories for a wide range of physics and\nastrophysics. Understanding how they are created, how they evolve and where we\nfind them in the Galaxy, with or without binary companions, is highly\nconstraining of theories of stellar and binary evolution. Pulsars' relationship\nwith a recently discovered variety of apparently different classes of neutron\nstars is an interesting modern astrophysical puzzle which we consider in Part I\nof this review. Radio pulsars are also famous for allowing us to probe the laws\nof nature at a fundamental level. They act as precise cosmic clocks and, when\nin a binary system with a companion star, provide indispensable venues for\nprecision tests of gravity. The different applications of radio pulsars for\nfundamental physics will be discussed in Part II. We finish by making mention\nof the newly discovered class of astrophysical objects, the Fast Radio Bursts,\nwhich may or may not be related to radio pulsars or neutron stars, but which\nwere discovered in observations of the latter.\n", "  Physics education research has consistently shown that students have higher\nlearning outcomes when enrolled in interactive-engagement courses.\nConsequently, many schools are actively reforming their introductory curricula.\nFor courses where the interactive sections (labs, tutorials, and/or workshops)\nare mostly taught by graduate student teaching assistants (TAs), good TAs are\ninstrumental to the success of the reform. Many studies have investigated\nspecific interactions between TAs and students, but more can be learned through\na holistic examination of TA-student interactions. Over the course of one\nsemester, I observed TAs in their various teaching roles using the Real-time\nInstructor Observation Tool (RIOT). These observations serve to show what TAs\nmay \"default to\" with little to no intervention. I present a snapshot of a\ndepartment in the early stages of reform and discuss the implications of my\nfindings as they relate to the professional development of our TAs.\n", "  Sunspot numbers are important tracers of historical solar activity. They are\nimportant in the prediction of oncoming solar maximum, in the design of\nlifetimes of space assets, and in assessing the extent of solar-radiation\nimpact on the space environment. Sunspot numbers were obtained visually from\nsunspot drawings. The availability of digital images from the US Air Force\nImproved Solar Optical Observing Network (ISOON) prototype telescope concurrent\nto observer-dependent sunspot numbers recorded at the National Solar\nObservatory (NSO) has provided a basis for comparing sunspot numbers determined\nfrom the two methods. We compare sunspot numbers from visual and digital\nmethods observed nearly simultaneously. The advantages of digital imagery are\nillustrated.\n", "  In this paper we explore the possibility of using transition edge sensor\n(TES) detectors in multi-mode configuration in the focal plane of the Short\nWavelength Instrument for the Polarization Explorer (SWIPE) of the\nballoon-borne polarimeter Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE) for the\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization. This study is motivated by the\nfact that maximizing the sensitivity of TES bolometers, under the augmented\nbackground due to the multi-mode design, requires a non trivial choice of\ndetector parameters. We evaluate the best parameter combination taking into\naccount scanning strategy, noise constraints, saturation power and operating\ntemperature of the cryostat during the flight.\n", "  We discuss the development of interactive video tutorial-based problems to\nhelp introductory physics students learn effective problem solving heuristics.\nThe video tutorials present problem solving strategies using concrete examples\nin an interactive environment. They force students to follow a systematic\napproach to problem solving and students are required to solve sub-problems\n(research-guided multiple choice questions) to show their level of\nunderstanding at every stage of prob lem solving. The tutorials are designed to\nprovide scaffolding support at every stage of problem solving as needed and\nhelp students view the problem solving process as an opportunity for knowledge\nand skill acquisition rather than a \"plug and chug\" chore. A focus on helping\nstudents learn first to analyse a problem qualitatively, and then to plan a\nsolution in terms of the relevant physics principles, can be useful for\ndeveloping their reasoning skills. The reflection stage of problem solving can\nhelp students develop meta-cognitive skills because they must focus on what\nthey have learned by solving the problem and how it helps them extend and\norganize their knowledge. Preliminary evaluations show that a majority of\nstudents who are unable to solve the tutorial problems without help can solve\nsimilar problems after working through the video tutorial. Further evaluation\nto assess the development of useful skills in tutorial learners vs. control\ngroup is underway.\n", "  Magneli phase Ti5O9 ceramics with 200-nm grain-size were fabricated by\nhot-pressing nanopowders of titanium and anatase TiO2 at 1223 K. The\nthermoelectric properties of these ceramics were investigated from room\ntemperature to 1076 K. We show that the experimental variation of the\nelectrical conductivity with temperature follows a small-polaron model and that\nthe Seebeck coefficient can be explained by a temperature-dependent\nHeikes-Chaikin-Beni model. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT of this\nnanoceramic material reaches 0.3 at 1076 K.\n", "  Interstellar extinction includes both absorption and scattering of photons\nfrom interstellar gas and dust grains, and it has the effect of altering a\nsource's spectrum and its total observed intensity. However, while multiple\nabsorption models exist, there are no useful scattering models in standard\nX-ray spectrum fitting tools, such as XSPEC. Nonetheless, X-ray halos, created\nby scattering from dust grains, are detected around even moderately absorbed\nsources and the impact on an observed source spectrum can be significant, if\nmodest, compared to direct absorption. By convolving the scattering cross\nsection with dust models, we have created a spectral model as a function of\nenergy, type of dust, and extraction region that can be used with models of\ndirect absorption. This will ensure the extinction model is consistent and\nenable direct connections to be made between a source's X-ray spectral fits and\nits UV/optical extinction.\n", "  The existence of minimal length scale has motivated the proposal of\ngeneralized uncertainty principle, which provides a potential routine to probe\nquantum gravitational effects in low-energy quantum mechanics experiment.\nHitherto, the tabletop experiment of testing deviations from ordinary quantum\nmechanics are mostly based on microscopic objects. However, the feasibility of\nthese studies are challenged by the recent study of spacetime quantization for\ncomposite macroscopic body. In this paper, we propose a scheme to probe quantum\ngravity effects by revealing the deviations from predictions of Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle. Our scheme focus on manipulating the interaction\nsequences between external laser fields and a single trapped ion to seek\nevidence of spacetime quantization, therefore reduce the complicity induced by\nlarge bodies to some extent. The relevant study for microscopic particles is\ncrucial considering the lack of satisfactory theories regarding basic\nproperties for multi-particles in the framework of quantum gravity. Meanwhile,\nwe are managed to set a new upper limit for deformation parameter.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating the expected time to find a maximum\ndegree node on a graph using a (parameterized) biased random walk. For\nassortative graphs the positive degree correlation serves as a local gradient\nfor which a bias towards selecting higher degree neighbors will on average\nreduce the search time. Unfortunately, although the expected absorption time on\nthe graph can be written down using the theory of absorbing Markov chains,\ncomputing this time is infeasible for large graphs. With this motivation, we\nconstruct an absorbing Markov chain with a state for each degree of the graph,\nand observe computing the expected absorption time is now computationally\nfeasible. Our paper finds preliminary results along the following lines: i)\nthere are graphs for which the proposed Markov model does and graphs for which\nthe model does not capture the absorbtion time, ii) there are graphs where\nrandom sampling outperforms biased random walks, and graphs where biased random\nwalks are superior, and iii) the optimal bias parameter for the random walk is\ngraph dependent, and we study the dependence on the graph assortativity.\n", "  The ability to modulate an optical field via an electric field is regarded as\na key function of electro-optic interconnects, which are used in optical\ncommunications and information processing systems. One of the main required\ndevices for such interconnects is the electro-optic modulator (EOM). Current\nEOM based on the electro-optic effect and the electro-absorption effect often\nis bulky and power inefficient due to the weak electro-optic properties of its\nconstituent materials. Here we propose a new mechanism to produce an\narbitrary-waveform EOM based on the quantum interference, in which both the\nreal and imaginary parts of the susceptibility are engineered coherently with\nthe superhigh efficiency. Based on this EOM, a waveform interconnect from the\nvoltage to the modulated optical absorption is realised. We expect that such a\nnew type of electro-optic interconnect will have a broad range of applications\nincluding the optical communications and network.\n", "  Despite its centrality in the mathematical structure of perturbative\nmany-body theory, the total Green's function for the many-body time-dependent\nSchrodinger equation has been ignored for decades, superseded by\nsingle-particle Green's functions, for which a vast portion of the literature\nhas been devoted. In this paper, we give the first computation the total\nGreen's function for the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a\nnon-interacting system of identical particles, setting the stage for a fresh\ninterpretation of perturbative many-body physics.\n", "  Ab initio calculations have been performed to clarify the primary behaviors\nof He atoms in vanadium and to generate the database for the development of the\ninteratomic potential for V-He system within the framework of\nthe\"s-band\"model.The calculated formation energies of the\ntetrahedral,octahedral and substitutional He defects,as well as those for\nHe2,He3 and He2V clusters are reasonable when compared with relevant\nexperimental results and ab initio calculations under the same conditions.The\napplicability of the present V-He potential for atomistic simulations to\ninvestigate the moving,clustering,and trapping of interstitial He atoms in\nvanadium are demonstrated.Similar to the results in iron and tungsten,the\ninterstitial He atoms can migrate quickly in vanadium. However,He atoms\naggregate into clusters with low binding energies,and the trapping of He atoms\ndepend much on the pre-existing traps in vanadium.\n", "  We present a new model to identify natural fluctuations in fluids, allowing\nus to describe localization phenomena in the transport of electrons, positrons\nand positronium through non-polar fluids. The theory contains no free\nparameters and allows for the calculation of capture cross sections\n$\\sigma_{cap}(\\epsilon)$ of light-particles in any non-polar fluid, required\nfor non-equilibrium transport simulations. We postulate that localization\noccurs through large shallow traps before stable bound states are formed. Our\nresults allow us to explain most of the experimental observations of changes in\nmobility and annihilation rates in the noble gases and liquids as well as make\npredictions for future experiments. Quantities which are currently inaccessible\nto experiment, such as positron mobilities, can be obtained from our theory.\nUnlike other theoretical approaches to localization, the outputs of our theory\ncan be applied in non-equilibrium transport simulations and an extension to the\ndetermination of waiting time distributions for localized states is straight\nforward.\n", "  n-ary algebras have played important roles in mathematics and mathematical\nphysics. The purpose of this paper is to construct a deformation of\nVirasoro-Witt n-algebra based on an oscillator realization with two independent\nparameters (p, q) and investigate its n-Lie subalgebra.\n", "  We present the detection of Cepheids in the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1313,\nusing the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescpoe.\nTwenty B (F450W) and V (F555W) epochs of observations spanning over three weeks\nwere obtained, on which the profile-fitting photometry of all stars in the\nmonitored field was performed using the package HSTphot. A sample of 26\nvariable stars have been identified to be Cepheids, with periods between 3 and\n14 days. Based on the derived period-luminosity relations in B and V bands, we\nobtain an extinction-corrected distance modulus of mu = 28.32 +- 0.08 (random)\n+- 0.06 (systematic), employing the Large Magellanic Cloud as the distance zero\npoint calibrator. The above moduli correspond to a distance of 4.61 +- 0.17\n(random) +- 0.13 (systematic) Mpc, consistent with previous measurements\nreported in the literature with uncertainties. In addition, the reddening to\nNGC 1313 is found to be small.\n", "  In this note we propose a version of the classical Stone-Weierstrass theorem\nin the context of quantum operations, by introducing a particular class of\nquantum operations, dubbed polynomial quantum operations. This result permits\nto interpret from a probabilistic point of view, and up to a certain\napproximation, any continuous function from the real cube [0; 1]^n to the real\ninterval [0; 1] as a quantum operation.\n", "  The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a particle-based, Lagrangian\nmethod for fluid-flow simulations. In this work, fundamental concepts of this\nmethod are first briefly recalled. Then, the ability to accurately model\ngranular materials using an introduced visco-plastic constitutive rheological\nmodel is studied. For this purpose sets of numerical calculations (2D and 3D)\nof the fundamental problem of the collapse of initially vertical cylinders of\ngranular materials are performed. The results of modeling of columns with\ndifferent aspect ratios and different angles of internal friction are\npresented. The numerical outcomes are assessed not only with respect to the\nreference experimental data but also with respect to other numerical methods,\nnamely the Distinct Element Method and the Finite Element Method. In order to\nimprove the numerical efficiency of the method, the Graphics Processing Units\nimplementation is presented and some related issues are discussed. It is\nbelieved that this study corresponds to a new application of SPH approaches for\nsimulations of granular media and results reveal the interest of this method to\ncapture fine details of processes of such complex problems as waves-seabed\ninteractions.\n", "  We report site disorder driven ferromagnetic ordering of nearly 8$\\%$ Ce\natoms in single crystalline Ce${_3}$Os${_4}$Ge$_{13}$ below 0.5~K.\nCe${_3}$Os${_4}$Ge$_{13}$ crystallizes in a cubic structure with space group\n$\\it{Pm\\bar{3}n}$. The structural analysis shows the presence of site-disorder\nin the system, where 2(a) Ge site is partially occupied by the Ce atoms. Due to\nthe small Ce $4f$-ligand hybridization, these Ce atoms are in the Ce$^{3+}$\n(magnetic) state while rest of the Ce atoms in the unit cell are in\nCe$^{4-\\delta}$ (non-magnetic) state. The heat capacity shows a peak below\n0.5~K corresponding to the ferromagnetic ordering of the Ce$^{3+}$ moments. The\nferromagnetic ordering below 0.5~K is also seen in the ac-susceptibility data.\nAt low temperatures (1.8~K$\\leq T\\leq 6$~K), the magnetization shows $log(T)$\ndependence, whereas the resistivity shows power law ($T^n$) temperature\ndependence indicating the non-Fermi liquid behavior of the quasiparticles.\n", "  In recent years the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach gained\npopularity in modeling multiphase and free-surface flows. In many situations,\ndue to certain reasons, interface and free-surface fragmentation occurs. As a\nresult single SPH particle solids/droplets of one phase can appear and travel\nthrough other phases. In this paper we investigate this issue focusing on a\nmovement of such single SPH particles. The main questions we try to answer here\nare: is movement of such particles physically correct? What is its physical\nsize? How numerical parameters affect on it? With this in mind we performed\nsimple simulations of solid particles falling due to gravity in a fluid.\nConsidering three different diameters of a single particle, we compared values\nof the drag coefficient and the velocity obtained through the SPH approach with\nthe experimental and the analytical reference data. In the way to accurately\nmodel multiphase flows with free-surfaces we proposed and validated a novel SPH\nformulation.\n", "  Individual Kekule valence structures of biphenylene and related hydrocarbons\nare comparatively studied in respect of their total pi-electron energies and\nthereby relative stabilities. These structures are modeled as sets of\nweakly-interacting initially-double (C=C) bonds. The relevant total energies\nare represented in the form of power series, wherein the averaged resonance\nparameter of initially-single (C-C) bonds underlies the expansion. To\nrationalize the resulting distinctions in total energies, interrelations are\nsought between separate members of the series, on the one hand, and presence of\ndefinite substructures in the given Kekule valence structure, on the other\nhand. It is shown that monocycles S_1 and S_2 correspondingly containing two\nand four exocyclic methylene groups (like 3,4-dimethylene cyclobutene and\n[4]radialene) participate in the formation of energy corrections of the\nrelevant Kekule valence structures along with the usual conjugated circuits of\nthe 4n+2 and 4n series (R_n and Q_n, n=1,2,3...). Thus, the cycles S_1 and S_2\nare deductively predicted to play the role of supplementary conjugated circuits\nfor biphenylene-like hydrocarbons. Moreover, the S_2- and S_1- containing\nstructures are shown to be the most stable ones among all Kekule valence\nstructures of the given hydrocarbon. Meanwhile, the lowest stability is\npredicted for structures in which either the neighboring hexagonal rings are\nconnected by two C=C bonds or two exocyclic C=C bonds are attached to the same\nhexagonal ring.\n", "  We study an inhomogenous multispecies version of the Totally Asymmetric\nSimple Exclusion Process (TASEP) on a periodic oriented one dimensional\nlattice, which depends on two sets of parameters $({\\bf \\tau},{\\bf \\nu})$,\nattached to the particles. After discussing the Yang-Baxter integrability of\nour model, we study its (unnormalized) stationary measure. Motivated by the\nintegrability of the model we introduce a further set of spectral parameters\n${\\bf z}$, attached to the sites of the lattice, and we uncover a remarkable\nunderlying algebraic structure. We provide exact formulas for the stationary\nmeasure and prove the factorization of the stationary probability of certain\nconfigurations in terms of double Schubert polynomials in $({\\bf \\tau},{\\bf\n\\nu})$.\n", "  We present simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations of seven\nyoung and highly variable M dwarfs in star forming regions in Orion, conducted\nin 4 observing nights with FORS2 at ESO/VLT. All seven targets show significant\nphotometric variability in the I-band, with amplitudes between 0.1-0.8 mag, The\nspectra, however, remain remarkably constant, with spectral type changes less\nthan 0.5 subtypes. Thus, the brightness changes are not caused by veiling that\n'fills in' absorption features. Three objects in the $\\sigma$ Ori cluster (age\n$\\sim$3 Myr) exhibit strong H$\\alpha$ emission and H$\\alpha$ variability, in\naddition to the continuum variations. Their behaviour is mostly consistent with\nthe presence of spots with temperature of $\\sim300$ K above the photosphere and\nfilling factors between 0.2-0.4, in contrast to typical hot spots observed in\nmore massive stars. The remaining targets near $\\epsilon$ Ori, likely to be\nolder, show eclipse-like lightcurves, no significant H$\\alpha$ activity and are\nbetter represented by variable extinction due to circumstellar material.\nInterestingly, two of them show no evidence of infrared excess emission. Our\nstudy shows that high-amplitude variability in young very low mass stars can be\ncaused by different phenomena than in more massive T Tauri stars and can\npersist when the disk has disappeared and accretion has ceased.\n", "  By adopting a citation-based recursive ranking method for patents the\nevolution of new fields of technology can be traced. Specifically, it is\ndemonstrated that the laser / inkjet printer technology emerged from the\nrecombination of two existing technologies: sequential printing and static\nimage production. The dynamics of the citations coming from the different\n\"precursor\" classes illuminates the mechanism of the emergence of new fields\nand give the possibility to make predictions about future technological\ndevelopment. For the patent network the optimal value of the PageRank damping\nfactor is close to 0.5; the application of d=0.85 leads to unacceptable ranking\nresults.\n", "  Quantum phase slip (QPS) is the particular manifestation of quantum\nfluctuations of the order parameter of a current-biased quasi-1D\nsuperconductor. The QPS event(s) can be considered a dynamic equivalent of\ntunneling through conventional Josephson junction containing static in space\nand time weak link(s). At low temperatures T<<Tc the QPS effect leads to finite\nresistivity of narrow superconducting channels and suppresses persistent\ncurrents in tiny nanorings. Here we demonstrate that the quantum tunneling of\nphase may result in Coulomb blockade: superconducting nanowire, imbedded in\nhigh-Ohmic environment, below a certain bias voltage behaves as an insulator.\n", "  The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (tSZ) is a powerful probe to study\nclusters of galaxies and is complementary with respect to X-ray, lensing or\noptical observations. Previous arcmin resolution tSZ observations ({\\it e.g.}\nSPT, ACT and Planck) only enabled detailed studies of the intra-cluster medium\nmorphology for low redshift clusters ($z < 0.2$). Thus, the development of\nprecision cosmology with clusters requires high angular resolution observations\nto extend the understanding of galaxy cluster towards high redshift. NIKA2 is a\nwide-field (6.5 arcmin field of view) dual-band camera, operated at $100 \\ {\\rm\nmK}$ and containing $\\sim 3300$ KID (Kinetic Inductance Detectors), designed to\nobserve the millimeter sky at 150 and 260 GHz, with an angular resolution of 18\nand 12 arcsec respectively. The NIKA2 camera has been installed on the IRAM\n30-m telescope (Pico Veleta, Spain) in September 2015. The NIKA2 tSZ\nobservation program will allow us to observe a large sample of clusters (50) at\nredshift ranging between 0.5 and 1. As a pathfinder for NIKA2, several clusters\nof galaxies have been observed at the IRAM 30-m telescope with the NIKA\nprototype to cover the various configurations and observation conditions\nexpected for NIKA2.\n", "  Stimulation of specific neurons expressing opsins in a targeted region to\nmanipulate brain function has proved to be a powerful tool in neuroscience.\nHowever, the use of visible light for optogenetic stimulation is invasive due\nto low penetration depth and tissue damage owing to larger absorption and\nscattering. Here, we report, for the first time, in-depth non-scanning\nfiber-optic two-photon optogenetic stimulation (FO-TPOS) of neurons in-vivo in\ntransgenic mouse models. In order to optimize the deep-brain stimulation\nstrategy, we characterized two-photon activation efficacy at different\nnearinfrared laser parameters. The significantly-enhanced in-depth stimulation\nefficiency of FO-TPOS as compared to conventional single-photon beam was\ndemonstrated both by experiments and Monte Carlo simulation. The non-scanning\nFO-TPOS technology will lead to better understanding of the in-vivo neural\ncircuitry because this technology permits more precise and less invasive\nanatomical delivery of stimulation.\n", "  Determining the minimum number of states required by a finite automaton to\nseparate a given pair of different words is an important problem. In this\npaper, we consider this problem for quantum automata (QFAs). We show that\n2-state QFAs can separate any pair of words in nondeterministic acceptance mode\nand conjecture that they can separate any pair also with zero-error. Then, we\nfocus on (a more general problem) separating a pair of two disjoint finite set\nof words. We show that QFAs can separate them efficiently in nondeterministic\nacceptance mode, i.e. the number of states is two to the power of the size of\nthe small set. Additionally, we examine affine finite automata (AfAs) and show\nthat two states are enough to separate any pair with zero-error. Moreover, AfAs\ncan separate any pair of disjoint finite sets of words with one-sided bounded\nerror efficiently like QFAs in nondeterministic mode.\n", "  The selective insertion of foreign materials, such as fluorescent markers or\nplasmids, into living cells has been a challenging problem in cell\nbiology.However, it is often necessary that researchers insert such materials\ninto cells for various dynamical and/or drug delivery studies. This problem\nbecomes even more challenging if the study is to be limited to specific cells\nwithin a larger population, since other transfection methods, such as viral\ntransfection and lipofection, are not realizable with a high degree of spatial\nselectivity.Here, we have used a focused femtosecond laser beam to create a\nsmall transient hole in the cellular membrane (optoporation) in order to inject\nnanomolar concentrations of rhodamine phalloidin (an impermeable dye molecule\nfor staining filamentous actin) into targeted living mammalian cells (both HEK\nand primary cortical neurons).Following optoporation, the bound to the\nintracellular actin network and rise in fluorescence intensity was observed...\n", "  We investigate the suitability of selected measures of complexity based on\nrecurrence quantification analysis and recurrence networks for an\nidentification of pre-seizure states in multi-day, multi-channel, invasive\nelectroencephalographic recordings from five epilepsy patients. We employ\nseveral statistical techniques to avoid spurious findings due to various\ninfluencing factors and due to multiple comparisons and observe precursory\nstructures in three patients. Our findings indicate a high congruence among\nmeasures in identifying seizure precursors and emphasize the current notion of\nseizure generation in large-scale epileptic networks. A final judgment of the\nsuitability for field studies, however, requires evaluation on a larger\ndatabase.\n", "  Here we report on the results of meteor observations with 9-channel\nMini-MegaTORTORA (MMT-9) wide-field optical monitoring system with high\ntemporal resolution. During first 1.5 years of operation more than 90 thousands\nof meteors have been detected, at a rate of 300-350 per night, with durations\nfrom 0.1 to 2.5 seconds and angular velocities up to 38 degrees per second. The\nfaintest detected meteors has the peak brightness about 10 mag, while the\nmajority - from 4 to 8 mag. Some of the meteors have been observed in BVR\nfilters simultaneously. Color variations along the trail for them are\ndetermined. All parameters of detected meteors are published online. The\ndatabase also includes the information on 10 thousands meteors detected by our\nprevious FAVOR camera in 2006-2009 years.\n", "  These notes are from courses given at TASI and the Advanced Strings School in\nsummer 2015. Starting from principles of quantum field theory and the\nassumption of a traceless stress tensor, we develop the basics of conformal\nfield theory, including conformal Ward identities, radial quantization,\nreflection positivity, the operator product expansion, and conformal blocks. We\nend with an introduction to numerical bootstrap methods, focusing on the 2d and\n3d Ising models.\n", "  Specola Solare Ticinese is an observatory dedicated to Sunspot Number\ncounting, which was constructed in 1957 in Locarno, Southern Switzerland, as an\nexternal observing station of the Zurich Federal Observatory. When in 1981 the\nresponsibility of the determination of the International Sunspot Number was\nassumed by the Royal Observatory of Belgium, Specola Solare Ticinese was given\nthe role of pilot station, with the aim of preserving the continuity in the\ncounting method. We report the observing procedure and counting rules applied\nin Locarno.\n", "  In previous work we have shown that positive streamers in pure nitrogen can\nbe guided by a laser-induced trail of low electron density. Here we show more\ndetailed results from such measurements. We show the sensitivity of this\nlaser-guiding on pressure p and found that the maximum delay between the laser\npulse and voltage pulse for guiding scales with something between $1/p$ and\n$1/p^{2}$. We also show that when we use a narrower laser beam the laser\nguiding occurs less frequent and that when we move the laser beam away from the\nsymmetry axis, guiding hardly is observed. Finally we show that laser guiding\ncan also occur in pure argon.\n", "  Transport equation of the dissipation rate of turbulent helicity is derived\nwith the aid of a statistical analytical closure theory of inhomogeneous\nturbulence. It is shown that an assumption on the helicity scaling with an\nalgebraic relationship between the helicity and its dissipation rate leads to\nthe transport equation of the turbulent helicity dissipation rate without\nresorting to a heuristic modeling.\n", "  Entropy and the second law of thermodynamcs were discovered through study of\nthe behaviour of gases in confined spaces. The related techniques developed in\nthe kinetic theory of gases have failed to resolve the apparent conflict\nbetween the time-reversal symmetry of all known laws of nature and the\nexistence of arrows of time that at all times and everywhere in the universe\nall point in the same direction. I will argue that the failure may due to\nunconscious application to the universe of the conceptual framework developed\nfor confined systems. If, as seems plausible, the universe is an unconfined\nsystem, new concepts are needed.\n", "  We demonstrate that judicious shaping of a nanosecond-time-scale frequency\nchirp can dramatically enhance the formation rate of ultracold $^{87}$Rb$_{2}$\nmolecules. Starting with ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms, we apply pulses of\nfrequency-chirped light to first photoassociate the atoms into excited\nmolecules and then, later in the chirp, de-excite these molecules into a high\nvibrational level of the lowest triplet state, $a \\, ^{3}\\Sigma_{u}^{+}$. The\nenhancing chirp shape passes through the absorption and stimulated emission\ntransitions relatively slowly, thus increasing their adiabaticity, but jumps\nquickly between them to minimize the effects of spontaneous emission.\nComparisons with quantum simulations for various chirp shapes support this\nenhancement mechanism.\n", "  We review results from our frequentist analysis of the parameter space of the\npMSSM10, in which the following 10 soft SUSY-breaking parameters are specified\nindependently at the mean scalar top mass scale Msusy = \\sqrt{M_stop1 M_stop2}:\nthe gaugino masses M_{1,2,3}, the 1st-and 2nd-generation squark masses M_squ1 =\nM_squ2, the third-generation squark mass M_squ3, a common slepton mass M_slep\nand a common trilinear mixing parameter A, the Higgs mixing parameter mu, the\npseudoscalar Higgs mass M_A and tan beta, the ratio of the two Higgs vacuum\nexpectation values. We implemented the LHC searches for strongly- and\nelectroweakly-interacting sparticles and light stops, so as to confront the\npMSSM10 parameter space with all relevant SUSY searches. In addition, our\nanalysis includes Higgs mass and rate measurements, SUSY Higgs exclusion\nbounds, the measurements of \\bmm, other B-physics observables, electroweak\nprecision observables, the cold dark matter density and the searches for\nspin-independent dark matter scattering, assuming that the cold dark matter is\nmainly provided by the lightest neutralino. We discuss the discovery potential\nof future e^+e^- linear colliders, such as ILC and CLIC, in the preferred\npMSSM10 parameter space.\n", "  For the search for additional Higgs bosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM) as well as for future precision analyses in the Higgs\nsector a precise knowledge of their production properties is mandatory. We\nreview the evaluation of the cross sections for the neutral Higgs boson\nproduction at e^+e^- colliders in the MSSM with complex parameters (cMSSM). The\nevaluation is based on a full one-loop calculation of the production mechanisms\ne^+e^- -> h_i Z, h_i gamma, h_i h_j (i,j = 1,2,3), including soft and hard QED\nradiation. The dependence of the Higgs boson production cross sections on the\nrelevant cMSSM parameters is analyzed numerically. We find sizable\ncontributions to many cross sections. They are, depending on the production\nchannel, roughly of 10-20% of the tree-level results, but can go up to 50% or\nhigher.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the construction of stellar outflow models emerging\nfrom a polar coronal hole-type region surrounded by a magnetosphere in the\nequatorial regions during phases of quiescent accretion. The models are based\non initial analytical solutions. We adopt a meridionally self-similar solution\nof the time-independent and axisymmetric MHD equations which describes\neffectively a jet originating from the corona of a star. We modify\nappropriately this solution in order to incorporate a physically consistent\nstellar magnetosphere. We find that the closed fieldline region may exhibit\ndifferent behaviour depending on the associated boundary conditions and the\ndistribution of the heat flux. However, the stellar jet in all final\nequilibrium states is very similar to the analytical one prescribed in the\ninitial conditions. When the initial net heat flux is maintained, the\nmagnetosphere takes the form of a dynamical helmet streamer with a quasi steady\nstate slow magnetospheric wind. With no heat flux, a small dead zone forms\naround the equator, surrounded by a weak streamer, source of a low mass flux\nmagnetospheric ejection. An equilibrium with no streamer and a helmet shaped\ndead zone is found when the coronal hole is larger and extends up to a reduced\nclosed fieldline static zone. The study demonstrates the robustness of\nself-similar solutions and their ability to provide quasi-steady jet\nsimulations with realistic boundaries and surrounded by equatorial\nmagnetospheres.\n", "  We measured the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth of\nLa3Pd4Si4 down to 0.02 Tc. We observe a temperature-independent behaviour below\n0.25 Tc, which is firm evidence for a nodeless superconducting gap in this\nmaterial. The data display a very small anomaly around 1 K which we attribute\nto the possible presence of a superconducting impurity phase. The superfluid\ndensity is well described by a two-phase model, considering La3Pd4Si4 and the\nimpurity phase. The present analysis suggests that the superconducting energy\ngap of La3Pd4Si4 is isotropic, as expected for conventional BCS\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We present a magnetic-penetration-depth study on polycrystalline and granular\nsamples of SrPtAs, a pnictide superconductor with a hexagonal structure\ncontaining PtAs layers that individually break inversion symmetry (local\nnoncentrosymmetry). Compact samples show a clear-cut s-wave-type BCS behavior,\nwhich we consider to be the intrinsic penetration depth of SrPtAs. Granular\nsamples display a sample-dependent second diamagnetic drop, attributed to the\nintergrain coupling. Our experimental results point to a nodeless isotropic\nsuperconducting energy gap in SrPtAs, which puts strong constraints on the\ndriven mechanism for superconductivity and the order parameter symmetry of this\ncompound.\n", "  A collection of more than 1800 carbonized Greek and Latin papyri, discovered\nin the Roman Villa dei Papiri at Herculaneum in the middle of 18th century, is\nthe unique classical library survived from antiquity. These\nancient-Herculaneum-papyri were charred during 79 A.D. Vesuvius eruption, a\ncircumstance which providentially preserved them until now. This magnificent\ncollection contains valuable work by Greek philosophers, such as Epicurus,\nChrysippus and Philodemus, in particular an impressive amount of extensive\ntreatises by Philodemus of Gadara, an Epicurean philosopher of the 1st century\nBC. The aim of the present study is to read extended and hitherto unknown\nportions of text hidden inside carbonized-Herculaneum-papyri using enhanced\nX-ray-phase-contrast-tomography (XPCT) non-destructive technique and a new set\nof numerical algorithms for virtual-unrolling. This paper documents our success\nin revealing the largest portion of Greek text ever detected so far inside\nunopened scrolls, with unprecedented spatial resolution and contrast, all\nwithout damaging these precious historical manuscripts. Parts of texts have\nbeen decoded and the 'voice' of Epicurean philosopher Philodemus is brought\nback again after 2000 years from rolled-up carbonized Herculaneum-papyri.\n", "  The atomic pair distribution function (PDF) for nano-particles has to be\ncorrected with a shape factor, also known as form factor, in order to take size\nand shape effects into consideration. For most anisotropic shapes an analytical\nformulation of the shape factor is a challenge. In this paper, we present a new\nmethod to numerically compute the shape factor using atomistic model. This\nnumerical method to calculate PDF for a wide range of geometrical shapes is\ndemonstrated. In addition, a fitting formulation, which effectively converts\nthe numerical shape factors for some selected geometrical shapes to the\nanalytical forms, is presented.\n", "  Elastic light-by-light scattering, $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$, can be\nmeasured in electromagnetic interactions of lead (Pb) ions at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC), using the large (quasi)real\nphoton fluxes available in ultraperipheral collisions. The\n$\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ cross sections for diphoton masses\nm$_{\\gamma\\gamma}>$ 5 GeV in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions at LHC ($\\sqrt{\\rm\ns_{_{NN}}}$ = 5.5, 8.8, 14 TeV) and FCC ($\\sqrt{\\rm s_{_{NN}}}$ = 39, 63, 100\nTeV) center-of-mass energies are presented. The measurement has controllable\nbackgrounds in PbPb collisions, and one expects about 70 and 2500 signal events\nper year at the LHC and FCC respectively, after typical detector acceptance and\nreconstruction efficiency selections.\n", "  This problem was given at Third Experimental Physics Olympiad \"The day of the\nresistor\", 31 October 2015, Kumanovo, organized by the Regional Society of\nPhysicists of Strumica, Macedonia and the Sofia Branch of the Union of\nPhysicists in Bulgaria.\n", "  Electrical conductivity measurements on a 2D packing of metallic beads have\nbeen performed to study internal rearrangements in weakly pertubed granular\nmaterials. Small thermal perturbations lead to large non gaussian conductance\nfluctuations. These fluctuations are found to be intermittent and gathered in\nbursts. The distributions of the waiting time between to peaks is found to be a\npower law inside bursts. The exponent is independent of the bead network, the\nintensity of the perturbation and external stress. these bursts are interpreted\nas the signature of individual bead creep rather than collective vaults\nreorganisations. We propose a simple model linking the exponent of the waiting\ntime distribution to the roughness exponent of the surface of the beads.\n", "  Depth averaged conservation equations are written for granular surface flows.\nTheir application to the study of steady surface flows in a rotating drum\nallows to find experimentally the constitutive relations needed to close these\nequations from measurements of the velocity profile in the flowing layer at the\ncenter of the drum and from the flowing layer thickness and the static/flowing\nboundary profiles. The velocity varies linearly with depth, with a gradient\nindependent of both the flowing layer thickness and the static/flowing boundary\nlocal slope. The first two closure relations relating the flow rate and the\nmomentum flux to the flowing layer thickness and the slope are then deduced.\nMeasurements of the profile of the flowing layer thickness and the\nstatic/flowing boundary in the whole drum explicitly give the last relation\nconcerning the force acting on the flowing layer. Finally, these closure\nrelations are compared to existing continuous models of surface flows.\n", "  We investigate steady granular surface flows in a rotating drum and\ndemonstrate the existence of rigid clusters of grains embedded in the flowing\nlayer. These clusters are fractal and their size is power-law distributed from\nthe grain size scale up to the thickness of the flowing layer. The implications\nof the absence of a characteristic length scale on available theoretical models\nof dense granular flows are discussed. Finally, we suggest a possible\nexplanation of the difference between velocity profiles observed in surface\nflows and in flows down a rough inclined plane.\n", "  Considering recent results revealing the existence of multi-scale rigid\nclusters of grains embedded in granular surface flows, i.e. flows down an\nerodible bed, we describe here the surface flows rheology through a non-local\nconstitutive law. The predictions of the resulting model are compared\nquantitatively to experimental results: The model succeeds to account for the\ncounter-intuitive shape of the velocity profile observed in experiments, i.e. a\nvelocity profile decreasing exponentially with depth in the static phase and\nremaining linear in the flowing layer with a velocity gradient independent of\nboth the flowing layer thickness, the angle between the flow and the\nhorizontal, and the coefficient of restitution of the grains. Moreover, the\nscalings observed in rotating drums are recovered, at least for small rotating\nspeed.\n", "  We investigate the scaling properties of post-mortem fracture surfaces in\nsilica glass and glassy ceramics. In both cases, the 2D height-height\ncorrelation function is found to obey Family-Viseck scaling properties, but\nwith two sets of critical exponents, in particular a roughness exponent\n$\\zeta\\simeq 0.75$ in homogeneous glass and $\\zeta\\simeq 0.4$ in glassy\nceramics. The ranges of length-scales over which these two scalings are\nobserved are shown to be below and above the size of process zone respectively.\nA model derived from Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) in the\nquasistatic approximation succeeds to reproduce the scaling exponents observed\nin glassy ceramics. The critical exponents observed in homogeneous glass are\nconjectured to reflect damage screening occurring for length-scales below the\nsize of the process zone.\n"]}
